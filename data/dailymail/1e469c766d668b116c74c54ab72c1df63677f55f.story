Another British person has been killed in Syria, according to reports currently being investigated by the Foreign Office.

The death of the British national comes just days after two other Britons - Abu Abdullah al Habashi, 21, and Abu Dharda, 20, both from London – died while fighting in the Syrian border town of Kobane.

A Foreign Office spokesman today confirmed reports of the death were being investigated and said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Syria.

The Foreign Office is investigating reports of the death of a British national in the Syrian city of Kobane

The death of the British national comes after Abu Abdullah al Habashi, 21, (left) and Abu Dharda, 20, (right) -both from London - were reportedly killed last week while fighting in the Syrian border town of Kobane

'The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended.

'As we do not have any representation in Syria, it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited.'

It is thought that at least 500 Britons have now joined the conflict in Syria and around 27 are understood to have lost their lives after joining ISIS.

The terror threat level in the UK has been raised from substantial to severe in recent months as concerns mount that aspiring British jihadis are travelling to Iraq and Syria to learn terrorist 'tradecraft'.

Al Habashi and Dharda were reported to have been killed towards the end of last week while fighting alongside militants in the Syrian city of Kobane.

Al-Habashi, from north London, was of Eritrean origin and converted from Christianity to Islam during his teenage years. He is understood to have travelled from the UK to join the Islamic State in Syria in December 2013.

Dharda, from west London, came from a British-Somali background and travelled to Syria via Turkey in the same month as al-Habashi.

Neither death has been independently verified and their families could not be contacted. Police said they could not comment.

Dead: Abu Abdullah al-Habashi (pictured right, next to a militant named Abu Musa as-Somali ) was killed fighting in Kobane. The 20-year-old former Christian of Eritrean origin converted to Islam as a teenager

Militant: Al-Habashi was a well known and popular figure in Islamic State due to his media appearances

Kurdish fighters have been defending Kobane from an ISIS onslaught with the assistance of American air strikes.

Al Habashi is believed to have made comments supporting ISIS on social media prior to his death and appeared in at least two propaganda videos put out by the extremist group.

In August, he told the BBC that he was at the 'forefront' of fighting and claimed he was one of a few British jihadis who had fought with ISIS – also known as Islamic State - in both Syria and Iraq.

His family tried to convince him to return home but he said he was happy in the Middle East and there was 'no going back'.

He confidently said in the Newsnight interview: 'They say what all parents would say, "come back you're crazy etc." But I'm here for the sake of Allah.'

He described his experience as 'the best fighting and the hardest fighting' and that 'US-made weapons was the war booty.' Last month, the British fighter appeared alongside a German and a French ISIS fighter in the IS video, 'Wait. We are also waiting.'

Threat: In his video appearance last month, al-Habashi gesticulated wildly as he said: 'We will chop off the heads of the Americans, chop off the heads of the French, chop off the heads of whoever you may bring'

In the video, Abu Abdullah described the West as being full of 'puppets and apostates'.

He declared: 'We are waiting for you in Dabiq. We are waiting for you in Iraq so bring your coalition of unbelievers because unbelievers will not help you. We will take their weaponry as booty and these people will die.'

The British jihadist also vowed that all Islamic State fighters 'are willing to lay down our blood on this soil. So try. Try to come and we will kill every single soldier.'

'We will chop off the heads of the Americans. We will chop off the heads of the French, chop of the heads of whoever you may bring.'

He even promised that the black flag of the Islamic State would 'eventually be on the White House.'
