Here, LUCY ELKINS tells one nominee’s story...

Sitting beside her husband Peter as he slipped in and out of consciousness, Kay Hutchinson struggled to think clearly.

Peter, 64, had had bone-marrow cancer for the past four years, but suddenly his condition had taken a rapid turn for the worse.

Grateful: GP Janet Walker, left, has always been there for Kay and her family

He’d been at home for three weeks following a five-month spell in hospital - during which time his health had rallied. But overnight he'd become so ill that he'd stopped responding to Kay's voice.

'He was sleepy then he wouldn't wake up at all,' recalls Kay, 64, from Middlesbrough. 'I didn't know what to do for him or how to cope. It was frightening being on my own with him when he was so unwell.'

To her huge relief, the couple's GP,  Dr Janet Walker, turned up unexpectedly at their front door. She had been making frequent out-of-hours visits to keep an eye on Peter, and on that particular day last October she'd popped by after surgery had finished for the morning.

In fact, Dr Walker had been on hand, day and night, to help the couple cope with several major traumas over the past decade - including the sudden death of their only daughter when she was just 30 years old.

Here she was again to give medical help and emotional support when they needed it most.

Dr Walker examined Peter and explained that he was suffering from dehydration. Because Kay felt too worried to keep him at home, the GP said she'd get him into hospital to be put on a drip.

Not only that but she'd try and get him on a ward at the town's James Cook University Hospital, where he was known by staff - not on an impersonal general admission ward.

Kay says: 'Nothing is too much trouble for Dr Walker. She told me she would go to the surgery and sort it out and come back.'

Despite the fact the part-time GP should have finished work for the day, she returned and stayed with Kay for six hours while they waited for an ambulance to take Peter to hospital.

'She talked to me throughout,' says Kay. 'I was sitting on the sofa, crying, and she sat on the floor in front of me holding my hand. If she hadn't been there, I don't know what I would have done.

Beyond the call of duty: Dr Walker has helped Kay through some tough times

'She has the most wonderful, calm manner. As soon as she came into the house, I felt supported and able to cope again. She told me, "You know he's very poorly Kay." She was trying to gently prepare me for the end.

'We had no way of knowing when a hospital bed would become available or when the ambulance would come but Dr Walker told me not to worry - she would stay with me.

'She was here a very, very long time, and at one point she said, "Do you mind if I just phone home to let my family know I’m OK?"'

Dr Walker waited with Kay until the ambulance arrived at 8pm. 'Then she gave me her home number and said, "I'm on holiday next week but if you need anything just call me."

...She listened to us and talked to us for 
ages. I was crying and she got up and gave me a big hug and told us she 
was there for us if we needed anything

'I was amazed and touched. I called her on the Sunday and she was absolutely lovely and answered all of my concerns.'

It was, says Kay, typical of the care Dr Walker offers her patients.

Kay remembers when, eight years ago, her daughter Lisa died inexplicably of a pulmonary embolism  - a blood clot in the lungs - and Dr Walker went out of her way to support Kay and Peter.

'Nothing prepares you for the pain of losing a child,' says Kay.

'Just six weeks after Lisa died, Peter was due to have heart surgery but we thought it all might be too much for us so we went to see Dr Walker to discuss whether we could delay it.

'She was lovely and took a long time with us. Then she called us at about 8pm, long after she should have gone home - to talk to us some more about how we were feeling and to tell us why she didn't think the surgery should be delayed.

Unsung heroes: Nominate your medical saviour

'She asked us to come back the next week so that she could see how we were. And she told us to make the appointment for when the surgery had closed, so we could go in when it was empty rather than sitting in a room full of people, as she knew we were still so upset.

'She listened to us and talked to us for ages. I was crying and she got up and gave me a big hug and told us she was there for us if we needed anything.'

Then, four years ago, when Peter was diagnosed with cancer - a type called multiple myeloma - Dr Walker emphasised she was there for the couple whenever they needed her - not just when the surgery was open.

'When we found out Peter had cancer, I was in pieces and couldn't stop weeping,' says Kay, who has a son, Paul, now 41. 'Seeing how upset we were, Dr Walker said we should go back after the surgery had closed, so she would have the time to take us through what would happen next.'

During the next few years, Peter was treated by a number of 'fantastic' nurses and doctors - 'but none as outstanding as Dr Walker', says Kay.

'She has such compassion, and that type of kindness makes a big difference when you are going through the pain that we were at that time.'

...I am Evelyn's full-time carer and I get 
on and do it, but it's a lot to cope with and I don't know what I would 
do without Dr Walker

After being admitted to hospital for dehydration last October, Peter, a former process operator for the oil industry, was transferred to a hospice.

Yet even though he was out of Dr Walker's care, she still checked on the couple. 'She kept ringing us at the hospice to see how we were, which was very, very comforting,' says Kay.

Peter died on November 20, and Dr Walker phoned Kay as soon as she heard. 'She's never off-duty - you know she really does care,' says Kay.

It's for these reasons that Kay has nominated Dr Walker for a Daily Mail Health Hero award.

And Kay's not the only patient who's been overwhelmed by the GP's compassion and dedication.

Jacqueline Jowsey, 75, who’s had several major health problems, including a heart attack and failing kidneys, says: 'It is so amazing how Dr Walker bothers  to keep tabs on you. She has  even called me at 9pm to see how I’m doing.'

Three years ago, when Jacqueline had heart surgery, she was told by the hospital's nurses that 'Dr Walker was always ringing to make sure everything was OK'.

Her surgery's hours are 8am-6pm but she often sees patients well outside these times.

Colin Robinson, 82, whose wife Evelyn is ill with cancer and has had two strokes, says: 'Dr Walker often calls us in the evening to see how things are, and she'll pop in on her way home to check we are OK. You'll never hear her say she hasn't got time.

'I am Evelyn's full-time carer and I get on and do it, but it's a lot to cope with and I don’t know what I would do without Dr Walker. She is an amazing doctor.

'She will sit down and talk to us, all the time holding Evelyn's hand - making her and me feel much more reassured.'

Despite being so highly praised by her patients, Dr Walker - who is 43 and married with a 13-year-old daughter - insists she does 'nothing unusual'.

Talking to her, it's clear to see why her patients admire her - her soothing, warm manner shines through. She tells me: 'It's deeply flattering that Kay has nominated me for this award - but really I just do my job.

'Yes, I spent a lot of time with her when we were waiting for her husband to go into hospital, but I couldn't have left her.'

But Kay, who deeply misses Peter, says: 'You do get through these things - you somehow find the strength - but I don't think I would have coped if it hadn’t been for the support of Dr Walker.

'Without her this would have been so much worse. She's not just a GP - she's a woman with such a very big heart.'
