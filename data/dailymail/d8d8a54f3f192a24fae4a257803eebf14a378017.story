Changes: Criminal Justice Minister Damian Green is scrapping committal hearings to cut cases by up to six weeks

Criminals are to be brought to justice 'within weeks not months' under new plans to abolish committal hearings - the first stage of the court process.

Around 60,000 of the short hearings happen every year, where magistrates decide whether the accused has a case to answer.

These will now be axed in 29 areas of England and Wales, cutting the length of a case by up to six weeks.

Criminal Justice Minister Damian Green says it will be trialled outside of London, including in Birmingham, Manchester and Nottingham.

But some solicitors are worried that removing a tier of justice could be damaging - although it is very rare that a case is ever thrown out at this stage.

'Abolishing committal
hearings is another one of the steps we are taking to make justice 
swift and sure and to ensure our courts run efficiently and effectively 
for victims, witnesses and the taxpayers who fund them,' Mr Green said.

'The justice system needs continued improvement, and this announcement is an important step forward.'

Committal hearings are usually used to officially transfer a case 
from magistrates courts, where less serious crimes are dealt with, to the
Crown Court, which handles the most serious offences.

They were abolished in 2001 for 'indictable only' offences like 
murder, which have to be heard at a crown court because of their 
seriousness. 

But now committal hearings for 'either-way' offences, like some 
burglaries and drugs cases, which can be dealt with either at the magistrates of crown court, will also be scrapped.

Cuts: Losing Committals will mean more than 60,000 hearings will go each year, saving time and money

This will be replaced by new 'sending' procedures, where magistrates 
will make a decision on where the case will be heard in full without the
need for a hearing.

But experts say that the changes could in fact slow the courts process, not speed it up.

“I do have concerns that the sending procedure for either-way offences 
may result in delays in the crown court while evidence is served, and I 
would not like to see this becoming a case of "more haste, less speed",' Michael Jones, chairman of the Criminal Law Solicitors’ Association told The Times.

John Fassenfelt, chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, added: 'We 
believe that there is every opportunity for the evidence to be tested, 
both by magistrates on paper and, of course, by judges in the crown court when cases come before them for a plea and directions hearing. But
we would also like to see more cases coming through the magistrates’ 
courts and would like to see our sentencing powers increased to 12 
months’ custody.'

Other changes will include courts operating beyond the traditional 10am 
until 4pm, including weekends and evening sessions, as well as more 
video links between courts, prisons and police stations to save on time 
and costs.
