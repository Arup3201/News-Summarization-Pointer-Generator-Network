Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium is in line for a possible name change with the club set to negotiate a new deal with shirt sponsor Qatar Airways.

The Catalans' current contract with the company, worth £25million a year, is set to expire in 2016 and they are keen to broker a new deal.

Barcelona broke a 113-year tradition in 2013 when they agreed to display a corporate sponsor on the front of their shirts and it could be followed by an alteration to their famous stadium, a decision that would surely anger supporters.

Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker suggested that the company title could be incorporated into the name of the 99,000-capacity ground that has been home to Barcelona since 1957.

'Everything is a possibility for our company, we're open to surprises and one of these could be connected to the name of Camp Nou,' Al Baker said at a press conference.

'Qatar Airways and Barcelona have the same values. It is possible that our name is added to Camp Nou.'

Barcelona vice-president Javier Faus says the club have been happy with the Qatar Airways partnership and confirmed negotiations over a new deal are forthcoming. 

'Barcelona have nothing but gratitude for Qatar Airways. We are extremely satisfied with Qatar Airways and I can assure you there are zero problems with Qatar Airways, zero with Qatar and we definitely hope that this partnership lasts many, many, more years.

'We are set to negotiate a new deal with them. A final decision will be made this year.'

The news comes the week after it was reported that Barcelona's rivals Real Madrid could also change the name of their stadium, the Santiago Bernabeu, in line with a corporate sponsor.
