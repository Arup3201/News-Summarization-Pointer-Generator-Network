Correction officers at the notoriously violent Rikers Island jail in New York have been charged with smuggling drugs into the prison over a six month period.

Seven officers have been accused of sneaking cocaine and oxycodone into the island jail, charging inmates between $400 and $900 per package.

Two of the accused officers were recorded by an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency worker boasting about the alleged scheme and offering to use their 'badge and gun' to protect dealers.

The smuggling suspects were allegedly recorded discussing drug deals during an ongoing probe at Rikers Island by New York's Department of Investigation and several other law enforcement agencies.

Prosecutors say Steven Dominguez and Divine Rahming told an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency worker that they had been smuggling cocaine and oxycodone into the jail for five months.

They are also accused of offering to use their 'badge and gun' as protection for drug dealers outside the prison, according to the New York Daily News.

The DEA agent is understood to have been posing as a relative of a prison inmate when the men allegedly boasted of their drug smuggling activities.

'By smuggling drugs into Rikers Island, 
these corrections officers jeopardized the safety of the cityâ€™s jails 
and sold their honor as officers of the law,' said DOI Commissioner Mark
 Peters, who led the investigation alongside Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan.

Prosecutors have accused Correction Officer Deleon Gifth is accused of arranging to have a friend sneak oxycodone 
into Rikers Island in February of this year.

Two months later Gifth resigned from his post and he was charged with the alleged crime this week.

Another four unnamed officers face either demotion or the sack for their alleged role in the process.

These charges stem from either conversations the men had which suggest they knew of illegal activity taking place inside Rikers Island, or allegations their behaviour in the prison knowingly allowed drug dealing to take place.

In total the investigation has seen 12 correction officers charged with criminal offences - many of them described as 'ethical lapses', such as beating prisoners and covering up evidence.
