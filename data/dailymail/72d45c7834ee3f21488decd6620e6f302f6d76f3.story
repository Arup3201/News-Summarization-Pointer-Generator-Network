British adults are worse educated than
those in 18 other European nations including Lithuania, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia, figures showed yesterday.

Just 76.1 per cent are educated to A-level
standard - against 92 per cent in Lithuania.

Figures from the European Commission's
Eurostat website put the UK 19th out of 33 countries ranked according to the
proportion of the population aged 25 to 64 with an 'upper secondary education'
- equivalent to A-levels.

Just 76.1 per cent from the UK are educated to A-level standard - against 92 per cent in Lithuania

The University and College Union, which
unearthed the figures, said the UK faces falling further behind the rest of
Europe because of higher university tuition fees and restrictions on university
places.

The statistics show that in 2010, 76.1 per
cent of UK adults were educated to this level, compared with 92 per cent in
Lithuania, 91.1 per cent in the Czech Republic, 91 per cent in Slovakia and
89.2 per cent in Estonia - the nations at the top of the table.

Other nations ahead of the UK included
Germany, Austria and Luxembourg.

Despite the widely held opinion that A-levels have been dumbed down over recent years, it is still regarded as a more of a 'gold standard' compared to the four 'matura' exams taken at the same level by students in Lithuania.

UCU general secretary, Sally Hunt, said:
'The UK should be at the top of the table when it comes to education.

'We pride
ourselves on being world leaders in many areas and must not settle for
mid-table obscurity.

'Even more worrying is the very real
possibility that we will slide further down the table as people find it harder
to access education following price hikes and restrictions on places.'

By Jove I think she's got it: Schools Minister Nick Gibb called for schools to be 'more ambitious' in helping children improve their literacy (file photo)

Literacy in our schools at 'Dickensian-era levels'

Dickensian levels of  illiteracy still
plague parts of England despite decades of increases in state spending 
on education, a minister declared yesterday.

Schools
Minister Nick Gibb said ‘shadows of Charles Dickens’s world’ persisted 
in the country’s poorest areas despite major social advances.

Expectations
of children moving through the school system were too ‘modest’, with 
teachers settling too often for a ‘good enough’ standard, he claimed.

The result was under-achievement by thousands of youngsters, with one in six still struggling to read fluently by the age of 11.

In
a speech on the 200th anniversary of the author’s birth, Mr Gibb warned
that, just as in Victorian times, literacy problems were ‘heavily 
orientated towards the poorest in our communities’.

‘We need – if you’ll forgive the Dickens pun – much greater expectations of children in reading,’ he added.

He
also said pupils at primary school should be encouraged to read 
‘complex’ books by authors such as Michael Morpurgo, Jacqueline Wilson 
and Roald Dahl, while secondary pupils should read at least one Dickens 
novel during their teens.

Classic
works of literature were being ignored, he warned, with tens of 
thousands of pupils gaining GCSEs in English literature without studying
any books written before the 20th century.

More than 90 per cent of answers on 
novels in English literature papers were on the same three works – Of 
Mice and Men, Lord of the Flies and To Kill a Mockingbird.

Out
of more than 300,000 who took the country’s most popular paper last 
year, just 1,236 read Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, 285 read Thomas
Hardy’s Far from the Madding Crowd and 187 read Emily Bronte’s 
Wuthering Heights.

‘Unfortunately,
even when young people do wish to read, the exam system does not 
encourage them,’ Mr Gibb said. Despite a wide curriculum, ‘the English 
Literature GCSE only actually requires students to study four or five 
texts, including one novel’. He also claimed children in England were 
‘falling out of love’ with reading.

A study of 65 developed nations ranked the UK at 47th for the number of children who read for pure enjoyment, he said.

Some 40 per cent of pupils did not read for pleasure, against just 10 per cent in Kazakhstan and Albania.

Mr
Gibb said the current target set for 11-year-olds at the end of primary
school – that they reach level four in reading – was too ‘modest’.

Youngsters should aspire to the elite level five, he said.

A
survey of 500 employers by the Confederation of British Industry last 
year found that 42 per cent were dissatisfied with school-leavers’ basic
skills, while army recruiting officers have warned that hundreds of 
would-be soldiers have been turned away for failing basic literacy and 
numeracy tests.

Mr Gibb’s 
speech came as he launched a national reading competition designed to 
encourage seven to 12-year-olds – especially boys – to read more 
fiction.
