Michael Sam has revealed that his hugely publicized coming out in February wasn't really the way he wanted things to go down.

The NFL's first openly gay player tells People that he actually wanted to wait until he was drafted and in the pros to make the historic announcement.

'When I came out in February, it actually wasn't the time I wanted to come out. I was going to come out to my team – whoever drafted me,' said the newly-minted St. Louis Ram.

Planned to wait for the pros: The NFL's first openly gay player Michael Sam revealed to People magazine that he never planned to come out in February, but tipped off reporters eager to break the news eventually helped coax him to do so

Waited to experiment: Sam, seen here Tuesday at his first press event after being drafted, has now also revealed that though he's had feelings toward males since 7th grade, he didn't act on them until college

The 24-year-old defensive end made headlines then and has again returned to the media center stage after being drafted May 10 into the big leagues.

The Rams, of course, knew he was gay and it's all because of the media. But not in the why one might think.

'I did it because when I participated in the Senior Bowl, I was surprised how many people in the media knew,' he told People. 'Everyone who did an interview with me said, "Okay, we know you're gay, can we break the story?" So I said okay, and I called my agent.

Sam chalks the rest up to history, but it could have all gone down much differently, and less controlled, had it not been for his University of Missouri teammates.

'They knew they could tell whoever they wanted to, but they didn't,' said Sam, who came out to his fellow Tigers last fall. 'They kept it secret. They didn't have to. I was out. I did my own thing. I had my boyfriend.'

Sam revealed to People that he's known he was attracted to men his whole adult life, but didn't act on those feelings until more recently.

'I always knew I was different. I knew I had a male attraction probably in 7th grade,' he said. 'But I didn't act upon it. I didn't act upon it in high school. But college was different. College is all about experimenting. I did, and then I was like, "This is who I am."'

Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano famously shared a kiss--and a messy piece of cake--on national television Saturday in a photo that will no doubt go down in NFL history.

The draft turned Sam into an instant celebrity across the U.S. and especially within the LGBT community.

At his first Rams press conference on Tuesday, Sam reacted to hearing a story about a son who was able to finally come out to his father after being inspired by the football player's story. 

The call: Both Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano cried tears of joy as they received the good news and would soon share a kiss that made pro sports history

'I'm honored that I helped someone be comfortable with who they are, gave him a little courage to deal with his father. I'm honored to have that happen to his son,' Sam said.

'But right now I'm just looking forward to continuing on my dream. If it inspires other people, hey, I'm with you. Anyone that's not OK with that, if someone disowns you, be a part of my family. I welcome you. Ram up!'

Sam graduated of the University of Missouri and was selected in the seventh round of the draft.

A father posted the heartwarming tale of his son's coming out on the university's Facebook page after. The man says he was watching the draft with his son and other family members, who are mostly military veterans.

'When Michael Sam was finally drafted my 
15 year old son started crying and told me he was gay. He said he didn't
 want to hide anymore or be embarrassed about who he was. Thank you 
Mizzou for embracing Mr. Sam and recruiting a young man of his caliber 
so that kids like my son have more positive role models to look to...'

Thanked his teammates: Sam told People he's thankful for his teammates' respectfulness after they kept quiet after he came out to them last fall

At the press conference on Tuesday, Sam said he was thankful to have been drafted, especially just to a team located just two hours from his alma mater.

'St Louis feels just like home,' he said. 'I still [don't] really feel like I’m part of the NFL right now. I'm blessed.'

When asked what it felt like to be the first gay man hired in the NFL, Sam said: 'I guess it's great.'

He apperaed with five other late-round draft picks for the press conference on Tuesday.

After about 20 minutes, the other players left and Sam answered questions solo.

He says he hopes his landmark drafting will let other people know 'It's OK to be who you are.'

'Whether you're gay, straight, black or white. It's OK to be comfortable in your own skin,' he said.
