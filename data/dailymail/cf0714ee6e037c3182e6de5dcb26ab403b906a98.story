Thomas Pfeiffer, 44, was charged with abortion, strangulation and assault

An anesthesiologist allegedly choked a woman and forced her to swallow a pill that could cause an abortion after she told him she was pregnant.

Police responded on Wednesday night to a 'no voice' 911 call from a home in the town of Rosendale, 60 miles south of Albany, New York, according to the Ulster County Sheriff's Office. 

On arrival, deputies learned that 44-year-old Thomas Pfeiffer, of Red Hook, had choked the woman and forced her to swallow a pill that could cause an abortion.

Pfeiffer allegedly did so after the woman told him a home pregnancy test had come out with a positive result.

Police said that Pfeiffer allegedly tried to force the woman to take Plan B - an emergency contraceptive pill.  

Pfeiffer was charged with strangulation, abortion and assault. Police reported that more charges are pending. 

He's being held on Friday in the county jail on $50,000 cash bail. 

It couldn't immediately be determined if he has a lawyer.

Detective Lt Ed Brewster told RecordOnline that the felony abortion charge came after they were advised by the Ulster County District Attorney's Office.

The woman, whose identity has not been released, was treated at Health Alliance Hospital in Kingston and released. 

Police haven't released details on her relationship with Pfeiffer.
