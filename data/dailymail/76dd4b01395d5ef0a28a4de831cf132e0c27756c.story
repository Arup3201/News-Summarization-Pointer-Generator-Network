Think of a sex shop and what comes to mind is a slightly seedy store on the local high street, populated by large-breasted mannequins in sleazy lingerie and men in raincoats.

Sally Tyne, 49, from Worcester got so fed up with the awkwardness she felt when buying sex toys that she's launched her own, tasteful website to bypass the smut.

Whistle&Hum aims to provide a smut free shopping experienced for women looking to explore their sexuality

The Je Joue MiMi vibrator is a elegant pebble shaped external vibrator

Whistle&Hum is a website with an innovative approach to sexuality and sex products.

A calming white and pastel landing page greets visitors to the site, with not a hint of red, black or semi-naked ladies in provocative poses. 

‘Welcome to the smut-free but light hearted world of whistle&hum. We promise to keep things simple and straightforward; we will never talk about sex toys, pink furry handcuffs, fifty shades of nylon lingerie or twelve inches of kinky pleasure and we will never, ever encourage you to wear PVC’

The simple layout and discreet symbolic pictures aim to calm and reassure the nervous shopper

The simple layout and discreet symbolic pictures (think flowers, towels on beds, and of course, rabbits) aims to calm and reassure the nervous shopper.

Alongside unassuming and rather elegant vibrators, the site also sells Kegel toys to help women strengthen pelvic floor muscles, lubricants and even aromatherapy products.

All the products are of a higher standard than you might expect to find in your average sex shop.

The lubricant is organic lavender, ‘free from parabens, glycerin or glucose, silicone and petrochemicals’ and vibrators are all top of the range.  

All this discretion and quality does of course mean the price tags are a little higher than usual, with some vibrators costing over £100, and lubricant £15 for 118ml.

However the site offers an experience for women fed up with an erotica industry that subjugates women’s needs.

There is a section on Whistle&Hum dedicated to answering questions on types of toy, how to use them, and even more general issue like menopause, vaginismus and stress incontinence.

Founder of Whistle&Hum and former primary school teacher for children with special needs, Sally Tyne, 49, says: 'Many, many years ago rabbit vibrators were in the news, there were rabbit references everywhere and I decided to buy one.

‘I ordered it from a woman’s magazine. It arrived and, ready to scale new heights of pleasure, I unpacked it. That rabbit gave me shivers of horror!

‘Made from lots of plastic parts, there was a section containing tiny balls and another bit which cranked around; it made more noise than my washing machine.

‘My chap examined it in a detached technical sort of way, wondered whether it was safe and declared, “I wouldn’t put that anywhere near my undercarriage!” My fling with a vibrator was over before it began.

‘An unspoken gauntlet had been laid down,  I wanted to find the right website for me and the women around me. 

Whistle&Hum provides a discreet and helpful way to purchase high quality sex toys, but prices are a little higher than on the high street

Whistle&Hum also sell aromatherapy products, as well as offering advice on a number of issues effecting women's sexuality and sexual health

Those who are confused over what type of vibrator might work best for them can be gently guided through the choice

‘We reminisce, tell stories, our sexual side is part of our lives and holds its own small place alongside family, jobs, home and a thousand other things that make us who we are. But where was our website?

'At Whistle&Hum we don’t like the smut that surrounds them and we don’t like the feeling that buying a vibrator makes you one step away from pouting in a gold lamé body stocking with a stranger lashed to the bed.

'We do however, like the idea of women having somewhere safe and comfortable to go if they are thinking about buying a vibrator, or if there is a niggling something that is hindering their sexual enjoyment.

We promise to offer women straightforward information in a clean, upfront and honest way. Whistle&Hum is for all women - every age, size, background - who want to think about their sexual health and wellbeing.'
