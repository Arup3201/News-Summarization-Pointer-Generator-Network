Not content with your being in your pocket and living room, Apple is set to take over your car.

A leaked video shows a version of its iOS software, usually found in the iPad and iPhone, being used as a dashboard display.

It allows voice commands, and gives the user a full satnav linked to their phone.

A leaked video, posted by app developer Steven Troughton-Smith at the end of January, hinted to what the technology would look like. 
Troughton-Smith shared screenshots, like the one pictured, about what CarPlay might look like

The video was posted by app developer Steven Troughton-Smith, who shared a series of screenshots of what seemed to be Apple's 'iOS in the Car' feature announced by Apple as 'coming soon' to iOS 7 devices.

He then posted the video below showing exactly how the system will look.

The feature is intended to allow an iOS device to take over the in-dash display of a car, providing access to navigation, phone functions, messages, and music, all thorough touch and voice control.

The dashboard version of iOS can be controlled by voice so the user does not need to take their hands off the wheel

The video shows the feature being run in the iOS Simulator software for developers, with the in-dash display represented by a separate 800x480 window.

In notes posted alongside the video, Troughton-Smith said the iOS in the Car feature supports multiple resolutions of external displays, touch input and hardware controls, and voice input.

The move puts Apple in a head on battle with arch rival Google, which is developing a version of Android for the car, it announced earlier this year.

Google has joined with handset makers for the project, which includes Google, GM, Honda, Audi, Hyundai, and chipmaker Nvidia, and will focus on bringing the successful mobile operating system to in-car entertainment systems 'in a way that is purpose built for cars.'

The first cars with Android integration are planned for launch by the end of 2014.
