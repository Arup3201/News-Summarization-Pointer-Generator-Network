A hospice has surprised an elderly sports fan who has terminal cancer with a trip to a Denver Broncos game - in what his family said will be his last time outside.

Staff at Suncrest Hospice in Denver, Colorado blindfolded Mac Hilton on Sunday and told him he was going into the countryside to look at the autumn trees.

But 30 minutes later, his nurse April Lamb removed his blindfold - and showed the life-long Broncos fan that he was actually at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, surrounded by his wife and family.

After the shock subsided and Hilton's family cheered and hugged him, he simply said: 'Thank you.'

Suspense: Mac Hilton, who has terminal cancer, was taken from the hospice wearing a blindfold on Sunday

Surprise! But he soon arrived at Sports Authority Field and was stunned to see he was there to watch his team

It was the grandfather's first trip outside since January and although doctors have not said how long he has left, his family said this would probably be his last trip outside, 9News reported.

After the loud welcome, he was taken on to the field ahead of the game, where defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson greeted him and he got a hug from Miles the Mascot.

Hilton, who was unable to say anything as he took in the sea of blue and orange, simply grinned as he was given a football autographed by some of his favorite players.

'I told him he was going to the mountains, and I was going shopping,' his wife Neomi told 9News. 'I did a lot of lying!'

Joy: Accompanied by his son, the 87-year-old went on the field and met players and Miles the Mascot

Excitement: Mr Hilton then watched from the stands as his team defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars

Happiness: He takes a moment to appreciate the experience - the last times he may leave the hospice

He was then taken to the stands to watch the game against the Jacksonville Jaguars and during the national anthem, he held his hand to his chest and closed his eyes, overwhelmed by the experience.

And although Hilton was not well enough to see the end of the game, he would no doubt have been happy to learn that Denver beat Jacksonville to maintain their undefeated 6-0 record.

'It's a blessing,' his wife said of the experience. 'It's exciting. I can't even tell you how I feel about it. It's unbelievable.'

'It's a dream come true for him,' his son added.

'It's a blessing': His wife Neomi grinned as she admitted she might have lied to her husband to get him there

But hospice staff said that Hilton deserved nothing less.

'He's just a real special soul,' his nurse April Lamb told KDVR. 'You meet someone and you almost have this instant connection and Mac is definitly one of those people.'
