Tottenham have stepped up their interest in West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino after shelving a move for Jay Rodriguez.

Spurs have now made initial enquiries over a January switch for the striker, who is rated at £25million.

Southampton forward Rodriguez remains a priority transfer target for Mauricio Pochettino, but the delay in his return from a knee injury has forced Spurs into re-assessing their January plans.

Saido Berahino has scored 8 goals for West Brom already this season, attracting Tottenham's interest

The young striker earned a first England call-up with his impressive form for his club

And Berahino is emerging as Tottenham's No 1 target when the transfer wind re-opens next week.

Spurs will be one of the most active clubs next month with players moving in and out of north London.

Five months into the new season, Pochettino remains unconvinced by a number of the stars he inherited when he arrived from Southampton in the summer.

And the Argentine is determined to take serious steps towards revamping his squad next month.

The Argentine and his backroom team have been busy using their contacts in Spain to identify potential targets in January.

Espanyol defender Hector Moreno is player that is interesting Pochettino.

Spurs had been looking at Jay Rodriguez, who has not played this season due to a serious knee injury

The Spurs manager worked with the Mexico international during his time in charge at Espanyol and is keen on a reunion.

Pochettino has been keeping close tabs on Moreno's progress as he comes back from a broken leg.

Spurs' Spain-based scouts are also keeping tabs on Barcelona youngsters Sergi Samper and Adama Traore.

However, Tottenham will be just as busy trying to offload those that Pochettino has identified as not having a role in his long-term plans.

Rodriguez was in fine form last season, and looked in line for a World Cup call-up before his injury

Pochettino has had to rely on the likes of young striker Harry Kane for goals so far this season

The club will listen to offers for Paulinho, Vlad Chiriches, Aaron Lennon and Andros Townsend next month.

Likewise, the futures of Emmanuel Adebayor, Moussa Dembele and Jan Vertonghen are also unclear going into the January window.

Funds will be made available to Pochettino in January, but he knows he must sell members of the current squad in order to fulfil his vision for the squad.
