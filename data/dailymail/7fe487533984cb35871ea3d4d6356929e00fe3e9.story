The Congresswoman whose baby survived after a pre-natal diagnosis of an extremely rare and largely fatal condition has opened up about her 'miracle' daughter who was the first known survival story.

'The doctors said, "It's 100 per cent fatal. She will either be stillborn, you'll miscarry, or she will suffocate in your arms after she's born,"' Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler told People magazine.

Her daughter, Abigail, is now nine months old and healthy and crying like other children her age- but the difference in her case is that there was a large chance she was going to be born without lungs.

Big steps: Though Abigail is still on dialysis as she awaits a kidney transplant, her happy parents Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Beutler are able to live with her at their home in Washington state

Abigail is one of the 1 in 3,000 children who is afflicted with Potter sequence, wherein the fetus does not have kidneys or lungs.

Even though doctors said she would never survive, Mrs Beutler and her husband made the decision not to have an abortion.

'As the doctor is saying these things, I could feel her moving. To me, that was a sign I was not going to be the one that ends this pregnancy,' the 35-year-old new mom told People.

After announcing that her then-unborn child had the condition, a parent whose child had a similar disease reached out to Mrs Beutler and suggested she try an experimental treatment that helped save their son.

Jessica Bienstock, a doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital who specializes in high-risk pregnancies, had developed a way to inject a small amount of saline into the womb that acts create substitute amniotic fluid.

Miracle: Abigail Beutler is the first known case where a child survived after being diagnosed with Potter's syndrome, which causes babies to be born without lungs or kidneys

Fetuses with Potter's syndrome are not able to produce their own amniotic fluid because they are missing the organs- the kidneys- that are normally tasked with that job.

Babies with Potter Sequence typically die within a few days of being born- if not instantly, according to the National Institute of Health.

The most dangerous aspect of the condition is that the victims are born without kidneys, which normally produce amniotic fluid.

Because the amniotic fluid is not produced, the infant is not cushioned from the walls of the uterus, which can lead to abnormal facial and limb development. The condition may also stunt the development of the lungs.

The experimental new step that the Beutler's decided to take was to have a small amount of saline injected into the womb which acted as a substitute form of amniotic fluid and helped the baby's lungs form.

The amniotic fluid helps allow the lungs to grow, and although an expert in the new procedure, even Dr Bienstock was not confident about the results in the Beutler's case.

There were some signs of progress, however, that helped convince the Republican Congresswoman and her law student husband know that they were on the right track. One such instance came when the baby's head, which was at first mishapen, suddenly grew to the normal shape and its little legs were initially clubbed and then corrected themselves.

'The difference between 0 per cent hope and 0.00001 per cent hope is enormous,' Dan Beutler said to the magazine.

Abigail, who was born weighing only 2lbs 12oz stayed in intensive care for the first five months of her life before being deemed healthy enough to go home.

'She’s playing. She will scream when her diaper is dirty. She is like any other baby. She has a few challenges, but man, she’s determined,' Mrs Beutler said during a Today Show interview less than two months after the baby was born.

The saline injection helped produce lungs for the newborn but she is not fully out of the woods as she still does not have kidneys.

Miracle baby: Jamie and Daniel Beutler can now hold their daughter Abigail, who was born with a rare and usually fatal condition

She is being treated with dialysis and will need a transplant but that is expected to come from her father Dan, who is a possible match.

Mrs Beutler commutes to Washington D.C. from her home state of Washington in the northwest corner of the country, but her husband has taken time off from school to care for their daughter full time.

The ongoing treatment is expensive, and People estimates that it costs about $260,000 but that is a price the couple is happy to pay given the grim prospects they first faced.

Abigail's story is already helping others, as a mother in Colorado was given the same diagnosis and she talked to her doctor about 'this Congresswoman doing amnio infusions'. They then underwent the same procedure and the baby was born with a healthy set of lungs.

Mr Beutler said that like most parents, they were determined to never give up, and has advised families facing a similar situation to find a doctor willing to help.

He added: 'There's no guaranteed solutions and there's no magical cures ... but don't be satisfied with just one opinion because there's a lot of intelligent doctors with different perspectives and experiences.

On a Facebook page announcing the baby's birth, the Beutlers revealed how they refused to give up on their baby.

'Multiple doctors explained that based on medical evidence her condition was incompatible with life and that, if she survived to term, she would be unable to breathe and live only moments after birth,' they wrote.

'We were also told that dialysis or transplant were not possible. The options we were offered were termination or “expectant management,” that is, waiting for her to die. Instead, we chose to pray earnestly for a miracle.'
