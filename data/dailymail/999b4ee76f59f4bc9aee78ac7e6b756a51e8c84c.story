A 22-year-old woman is one of the youngest people in Britain to be charged with assisting suicide after the death of her friend.

Milly Caller from Great Hale, Sleaford, was arrested in connection with the death of 21-year-old Emma Crossman, whose body was found in the flat she shared with her boyfriend in January. 

At the time of her death, Miss Crossman's boyfriend- who asked not to be named - claimed it may have been inspired by a Coronation Street plot.

He told the Daily Mirror  that the girls were obsessed with watching the series, which included a euthanasia plot featuring long-standing character Hayley Cropper, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh.

In the soap, Hayley took her own life after a battle with untreatable pancreatic cancer. The storyline ran for several episodes before her death scene, which was watched by 10.2million viewers when it was screened in January.

Fans saw Hayley take a cocktail of drugs while her on-screen husband Roy Cropper sat by her side.

Caller was bailed pending further investigation, but was charged with assisting the suicide of another by Lincolnshire Police today.

She will appear at Lincoln Magistrates' Court on October 16. 

Police were called to the rented flat Miss Crossman lived in at 10.40am on January 15 where they discovered her lifeless body.

Today a Lincolnshire Police spokesman said: 'Following
 advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, Lincolnshire Police have 
charged 22 year old Milly Caller from Great Hale with assisting the 
suicide of another.

'The charge follows her arrest on January 15, 2014 in connection with the death of 21 year old Emma Louise Crossman.'

Caller is the second youngest person to be arrested and charged with the offence in Britain.

Last year  Kevin Howe was found guilty of assisting the suicide of his friend, Stephen Walker, in October 2013.

The 20-year-old was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment after helping the the 30-year-old set fire to himself. 

Following her death in January, neighbours described Miss Crossman as 'happy and bubbly'.

Sue Price, 33, who lives on the same street, said: 'She didn't seem to be depressed or poorly - to hear there's suicide involved just baffles me as she just seemed so lovely, happy and bubbly all the time.

'She lived there with her boyfriend I believe and we used to see her going out with her dad.

'We noticed there were two ambulances outside the house on Wednesday morning but thought it was just something minor.

‘We never expected anything like this - it's an absolute tragedy, she was so young.'

Adam Deakins, 22, who lived opposite the dead woman said: 'I knew her to say hello to in the street, It is a real shock.

'I saw all the police cars and a vehicle with blacked out windows arrive on Wednesday morning and I wondered what had happened.

'One of my friends had told me later that she had died and that one of her friends had been arrested. I couldn't believe it.' 

Assisting suicide is allowed in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands, and some US states permit doctor-assisted suicide. 

But it is illegal in Britain and carries a maximum jail sentence of 14 years.  

In 2009, a Crown Prosecution Service change in policy set out new guidelines which took into consideration public interest in prosecuting suspects arrested over assisting suicide.

Caller is the second person to be charged with the offence since the change in guidelines.
