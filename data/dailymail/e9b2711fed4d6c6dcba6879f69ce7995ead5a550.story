Are Manchester United right to sack David Moyes?

It would have boiled down to a simple question by the end. Can we trust this man to spend £200million? The Glazers would have sifted through all the available evidence and decided they could not. David Moyes is no longer  Manchester United manager.

The final reckoning would not have taken long. Even Moyes’s staunchest advocates had exhausted their ammunition by the time the final whistle blew at Goodison Park on Sunday. Appointing a manager without experience in the elite pool was a leap of faith and it has not been supported by results.

Shout of order: David Moyes sees United lose at Chelsea earlier this season

Had Moyes 
proved he could venture into new territory and thrive, then United’s 
owners would have willingly backed him in the transfer market this 
summer. Yet he has been unable to dispel the doubts that existed going 
into this season.

'He's failed every challenge, so why  would they trust him to spend £200m?'

He didn’t have Champions League experience and 
Manchester United conducted an inconsistent campaign that ended in the 
desperate measure of playing Wayne Rooney, unfit, against Bayern Munich.

He
 didn’t have title-winning experience and United were seventh within 
three matches, not rising higher than fifth since. He had never won a 
trophy and the closest Manchester United came under him was a Capital 
One Cup semi-final, lost to Sunderland.

He was famed for caution at 
Everton and United are missing their attacking swagger this season. The 
job was, as  predicted by a number of fearful United fans, too big for 
him.

Writing on the wall: Moyes has seen United fail to qualify for the Champions League this season

Final straw: Moyes watched United crash to their 11th league defeat of the season to former club Everton

And
 Moyes throughout his career has never spent anywhere near the sums that
 are set aside to revive Manchester United this summer. So why should 
the Glazers continue believing in him? Having failed so dismally with 
every other new  challenge, why should he be up to this one?

Sadly,
 Moyes has not added one new skill to his c.v. since leaving Everton, no
 fresh learning, nothing to suggest he is at home in the elite. And the 
overhaul of United this summer is a task for a high-end coach. Big money
 will be spent, big names will be jettisoned.

With
 no Champions League, or maybe even European, football to entice leading
 players, United must show they mean business. The presence of Moyes 
does not speak of ambition, not while he still has an L-plate attached 
to his jacket.

Ed
 Woodward, Manchester United’s chief executive, travelled to Paris on 
the day of Chelsea’s recent Champions League quarter-final tie. He said 
he might not even take in the game with Paris Saint-Germain but knew 
that major Champions League fixtures were wonderful occasions for 
gathering football’s powerbrokers in one place.

Leading
 club executives, agents, super-agents, they would all be there. 
Meetings, meetings,  meetings were what Woodward said he had planned. 
And maybe he didn’t like what he heard.

Perhaps
 the super-agents were not happy to place their super-clients with a 
club in the doldrums and a lame duck manager who could be gone by 
Christmas if results did not improve. Perhaps Woodward  discovered that 
with, say, Carlo Ancelotti at the helm, talks would progress more 
smoothly.

Off the pace: United have failed to mount a decent challenge for the Premier League this season

It
 is pointless pretending Moyes carries the same clout as his 
contemporaries at the major European clubs. He couldn’t entice Leighton 
Baines from Everton and they had worked together for six years.Ancelotti,
 or Louis van Gaal,  would bring a contacts book and a gold standard 
reputation. Their presence shows a club has intent, their track records 
increase  expectation of success. Moyes’s next trophy will be his first.

He
 no doubt imagined breaking his duck with Manchester United but that has
 not happened. He has no profile among players beyond these shores — and
 what little he does is now bad.

He’s
 the guy who stuffed up at Manchester United; just as, over here, it is 
Gerardo Martino’s duff season at Barcelona, not his eight titles in 
South America, that are known. With the Champions League creating a 
semi-permanent elite, football is no longer fluid as it once was. There 
is a hierarchy and Moyes is not part of it, no matter the endorsement of
 Sir Alex Ferguson.

The clock is ticking: Moyes' time at Old Trafford looks to have run out - despite the backing of Sir Alex Ferguson

That
 is what will end with Moyes’s departure, too. Manchester United: the 
Ferguson years. While the Chosen One occupied his seat, the hope was 
that the Ferguson dynasty continued. Here was a manager cast in his 
image, with the same values, capable of seamless transition.

It
 was hoped the old ways would remain, but what now? Ancelotti is a 
calming presence, a healer, but Jurgen Klopp is a German heavy metal fan
 with a nose for mischief, and Jose Mourinho learned many  of his 
confrontational skills from Van Gaal, now believed to be the leading 
candidate.

Whoever
 comes will rip up what remains of the existing blueprint because 
paramount importance is a swift return to the Champions League. Adnan 
Januzaj aside,  Manchester United next season will largely be 
restructured around proven, established internationals or young players 
who have already made the Premier League grade, such as Luke Shaw.

This
 is not a grandiose project, but a pragmatic, quick and expensive fix of
 this season’s malaise. Had Mourinho been available, he would have been 
perfect for the task.  Some will argue, with justification, that he 
should have got the job in the first place.

Making the call: Executive vice chairman Ed Woodward speaks to Moyes at the training ground this season

There
 will be sympathy for Moyes, stepping into Ferguson’s giant shoes and 
falling headlong down the stairs, but the bottom line is he got a 
fabulous opportunity and blew it.

'He stepped into Fergie’s giant shoes... and fell headlong down the stairs'

He did not inherit a vintage Manchester United team but it still won the title by 11 points, scored 
11 more goals than any rival and had a goal difference superior by 
seven. The defence was the most porous of any team in the top four but, 
even so, nobody can have expected a  collapse of this magnitude.

If they do not move beyond seventh place, Manchester United will
 have equalled the worst title defence in Premier League history, 
matched only by Blackburn Rovers the season after Kenny  Dalglish 
departed.

The
 most damning numbers, however, concern their performances against the 
better teams. In 17 league matches against clubs in the top half of the 
table, Moyes has won just three: Stoke City on October 26, Arsenal on 
November 10 and Newcastle United on April 5.

Backing of the fans: Supporters at Old Trafford hung a banner at the Stretford End in backing of Moyes

Losing the fans: A section of United fans paid for a banner to be flown over Old Trafford calling for Moyes to go

He
 is the first Manchester United  manager to lose home and away to 
Liverpool and Everton in the same season, the first to lose at home to 
Swansea City, the first to fail to qualify for the Champions League 
since 1995, the first to concede in the opening minute of a Premier 
League match, the first to lose three games in a row since 2001, the 
first to lose at home to Newcastle since 1972, the first to lose at home
 to West Bromwich Albion since 1978 and to Stoke since 1984.

He
 went out in the third round of the FA Cup, which Ferguson suffered only
 once in his Old Trafford career and, even if Moyes wins all of his four
 remaining matches, this will be Manchester United’s lowest points total
 in the history of the Premier League.

It all started so well: Moyes was all smiles when he was unveiled as United manager in July

As
 if this was not bad enough, the rise of Liverpool — and on a  personal 
note the improvement at Everton under Roberto Martinez — has put Moyes’s
 struggles into sharp relief. While United have plummeted, Liverpool 
have risen, from seventh to first in what may represent the greatest 
improvement by any championship-winning team in English football since 
Everton under Howard Kendall in 1983-84.

And
 Liverpool’s rebirth is what Manchester United fear most, not just as a 
local rival but as a force in the marketplace. Liverpool were a global 
brand in 1989 when Michael Knighton was still juggling balls on the 
pitch at Old Trafford, and if they take their place among Europe’s elite
 again there will be older generations across Asia, in particular, 
primed and waiting to influence the next editions of the family. Manchester
 United’s revenue streams are those of the market leader, but a well-run
 Liverpool with an eye on commercial opportunities abroad could, if not 
match them, then at least take a significant slice of that action.

Added insult: Seeing Roberto Martinez do so well at Everton is sure to have dented Moyes' pride

If
 the Premier League trophy is secured at Anfield on May 11,  its next 
destination after the open-top bus parade through the city the following
 day will be Dublin for a game against Shamrock Rovers on May 14, 
followed by a trip to  Mauritius to play Celtic, provisionally, on May 
18. Then there is the pre-season tour of the United States, taking in 
Chicago, New York and Charlotte.

These
 are all traditional United strongholds, suddenly under threat. Chelsea 
have encroached on  United’s territory, too, with Premier League chief 
executive Richard Scudamore now listing the London club among those with
 a significant following abroad. Woodward, the United chief executive, 
has been hailed as a wonder salesman, but he has never had to sell a 
club in  seventh place before — to big business, big agents or big 
players.

On the brink: Liverpool are close to winning their first title for 24 years

Moyes
 is the first casualty of that unexpected challenge. Wondering whether 
the manager could grow into the job was just another  question United’s 
bosses had no time to answer.

Ultimately,
 Moyes wasn’t the  Chosen One, or even a special one. Instead, he became
 the Problem One. And swiftly, that problem has been solved. Clearing 
the mess left behind, however, suggests a fresh set of problems for 
United are only just beginning.
