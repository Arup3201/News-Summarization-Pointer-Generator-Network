New York City's angrier version of famous clairvoyant groundhog Punxsatawny Phil made his opinion of Bill de Blasio quite clear when he leaped from the mayor's arms and tried to flee a Staten Island event on Sunday.

Staten Island Chuck, as he's called, wriggled out of the mayor's grip after predicting six more miserable weeks of winter this morning just like his country cousin.

But unlike Phil, Chuck has a rather nasty reputation.

Scroll down for video...

Six more weeks of WHOA! Mayor Bill de Blasio 
dropped the New York version of Punxsutawney Phil, Staten Island Chuck, 
at a Groundhog Day event Sunday

Back in 2009, Chuck famously took a 
chunk out of then mayor Michael Bloomberg's finger at the annual 
Groundhog Day event, something de Blasio mentioned before his own 
struggle with the rotund rodent.

'Chuck
 and my predecessor didn’t always get along, let’s be honest about that.
 But I’m hoping we can start a new day, a new relationship here,' joked 
de Blasio.

'I’m reaching out a hand to chuck and I hope he will consider shaking it rather than doing other things.'

Making amends: 'Now Chuck, what about this winter thing, Chuck? We can work something out, can¿t we?' de Blasio joked

Chuck didn't bite the new mayor, but he wasn't doling out his forecast without exacting at least a little payment.

As de Blasio slowly began to hold up the furball for a photo-op, he never quite got a grip.

Seeing
 an opportunity in the de Blasio's butterfingers, Chuck leaped the 
impressive distance between the 6-foot-5 mayor's waist all the way to 
the ground.

He landed 
within his pen, luckily, and the fast reactions of his Staten Island Zoo
 caregiver kept him from infiltrating the crowd.

Ouch! Staten Island Chuck has a history of mayoral hatred and once famously bit Michael Bllomberg

De Blasio seemed amused by the whole fiasco and joked afterward:

'Now Chuck, what about this winter thing, Chuck? We can work something out, can’t we?'

Punxsutawney Phil has spoken - and it is not good news.

Pennsylvania's famed groundhog emerged from his lair in front of thousands of fans around daybreak Sunday forecasting six more weeks of what already has felt like a brutally long and cold winter.

Legend has it that if the furry rodent sees his shadow on February 2 winter will last another month-and-a-half. If he doesn't see it, spring will come early.

In reality, Phil's prediction is decided ahead of time by a group called the Inner Circle, whose members don top hats and tuxedos for the annual Groundhog Day ceremony on Gobbler's Knob, the tiny hill in the town for which he's named about 65 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.

The prediction this year fell on the same day as Super Bowl Sunday.

The closest the game previously came to coinciding with Groundhog Day was in 2009, when the just-down-the-road Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 27-23 in the Super Bowl, the night before Phil's forecast.

The annual event, made world famous by the 1993 Bill Murray comedy 'Groundhog Day' draws thousands of tourists from as far afield as Australia and Russia.

A version of Punxsutawney Phil has been making weather predictions since 1887 - but since the release of the popular movie crowds of up to 30,000 have made their way to Pennsylvania to witness the ceremony.

The game this year featuring the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., will be the Super Bowl's 48th installment, while Phil has been predicting the weather since 1886.

This year's Groundhog Day celebration marks a winter that has brought extreme cold to stretches of the country wholly unaccustomed to it, as well as a snow and ice storm that paralyzed Atlanta and other Southern cities.

According to the legend, if it is cloudy when Phil emerges the groundhog will leave his burrow, which means that winter will soon end.

If Phil appears frightened and sees his own shadow - he will retreat back into his burrow - meaning that winter will continue for six more weeks.

However, most weather analysis of Phil's predictions have proved that he is on average, inaccurate.

'The groundhog has shown no talent for predicting the arrival of spring, especially in recent years,' according to the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina.

'Phil's competitor groundhogs across the nation fared no better.'

The center found that from 1988 to 2012, the groundhog was right 10 times and wrong 15 times about winter continuing for more than six weeks after February 2.

Indeed, last year, Phil did not see his shadow, which meant an early spring.

What in face occurred was a slightly warmer than average February but a chillier March.

Since 1887, Phil has seen his shadow 100 times and has not seen it 17 times - predicting an early spring.

Not everyone finds the tradition to be fair on Phil though.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals characterizes the handling of Punxsutawney Phil as inhumane, as the animal is on constant display and not able to hibernate for the winter.

The group has asked that Phil be retired.

'We think that using a cyber shadow-detector is a great alternative to yanking a frightened groundhog out of a fake burrow every February and waving him around in front of a boisterous crowd as cameras flash in his eyes,' PETA noted.

'Groundhogs avoid human contact and spend their days digging and burrowing. In February, they should be midway through their winter hibernation, not dodging the paparazzi.'

In their defense, the Inner Circle says Phil is a very special groundhog and he gets his longevity from drinking a secret punch.

He drinks it every year, at a summer picnic, and it is said that one sip gives him seven more years of life.

Phil is the most famous of a small group of groundhogs said to forecast the weather, including Staten Island Chuck in New York and General Beauregard Lee in Atlanta.

The National Climatic Data Center has put Phil's forecasts to the test and found them sorely lacking, declaring the groundhog has 'no predictive skill.'

'It really isn't a `bright' idea to take a measure such as a groundhog's shadow and use it as a predictive meteorological tool for the entire United States,' the data center says on its website, helpfully if somewhat obviously.
