 A Chinese mother has bought a $6.5 million (£4.3 million) flat in Manhattan for her toddler.

The woman told the New York based real estate agency that she wants the flat for when her daughter leaves home for college.

Kevin Brown, a senior vice president at Sotheby's International who specialises in selling the city's prestigious property, said the unnamed woman had snapped up the flat, CCTV reported..

Big spend: A Chinese mother has bought a $6.5 million (£4.3 million) flat in Manhattan for her toddler

Future planning: The woman told the New York based real estate agency that wants the flat for when her daughter will begins college

Luxury: The apartment is in the One57 tower, a 90-floor glass skyscraper

'We were running around the city looking at things and I finally said: 'Well why are you buying?'' Mr Brown said to the Chinese state broadcaster.

'And she said, well, her daughter was going to go to Columbia, or NYU or maybe Harvard and so she needed to be in the centre of the city and that was why she was picking this one particular apartment.

So I said: 'Oh, how old is your daughter?' and she said: 'Well she's two'. And I was just shocked.'

The apartment is in the One57 tower, a 90-floor glass skyscraper overlooking Central Park.

Situated on 157 West 57th street the tower will become the tallest residential building in the city when it is finished next year.

Grand: The building, which is still unfinished boasts a concert hall

Location: It will be managed by the Park Hyatt hotel brand and overlooks Central Park

High life: The luxury build comes with a glamorous swimming pool

Views: The building will offer stunning vistas but the enormous structure will block the view from other nearby luxury buildings, which are expected to see their prices fall

Designed by French architect 
Christian de Portzamparc, the space will offer luxury amenities like a 
full service spa, a screening room, private dining room, a full spa and 
even a pet wash room.

The
billionaires behind fashion label Michael Kors, Lawrence Stroll and 
Silas Chou, have both signed contracts for $50 million full-floor 
apartments in the tower.

A 'recognisable' buyer has snapped up a 
penthouse on the 89th and 90th floor of the under-construction One57 
tower block for a reported price of about $95million.

In exchange for the astronomical price the mystery buyer will get a 
10,923-square-foot space opposite Carnegie Hall with incredible views 
over the city.

The building will offer stunning vistas but the enormous structure will 
block the view from other nearby luxury buildings, which are expected to
see their prices fall.

In May, Forbes Magazine sent Morgan 
Brennan to get a look of the inside spaces in a build-out model at their
Midtown sales office, and was guided around the model apartments by 
Director of Sales Dan Tubb.

for the skies: Construction is expected to finally be finished in 2013.
When finished the building the building will appear as at right

The gourmet kitchen features outward ventilation and two dishwashers for units of three bedrooms and above.

The kitchen, which comes in two 
possible finishes, also includes two 36-inch refrigerators, granite 
counter tops, extensive storage, and a full-sized wine cooler.

Some cabinets are not what they seem and pull out from the kitchen island to become stools.

One penthouse suite was sold for a record fee in excess of $90million - and the new owner hasn't even seen it yet.

The astronomical fee eclipses the 
$88million forked out by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev on a 
penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 Central Park West.

It proves that while the economic 
situation may be precarious some still have deep enough pockets to 
splash out super properties.
