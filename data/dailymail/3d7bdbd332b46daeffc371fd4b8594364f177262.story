Neighbours heard screams from a man and a woman before a mother and her baby son fell from a balcony on the New South Wales Central Coast, killing the three-month-old boy.

The infant died from critical head injuries after falling more than five metres with his 43-year-old mother from the second-floor balcony of their Niagara Park home about 1pm on Sunday.

A neighbour told The Daily Telegraph she overheard a man and woman shouting, 'then a big bang'.

Mother and child fell through a painted steel sheet barrier and a flyscreen, the Telegraph reported. The boy then continued to fall to the concrete driveway.

The baby, named Aidan, was taken to Gosford Hospital before he was transferred via Careflight chopper to The Children's Hospital at Westmead. He died before arriving.

Aidan's mother remains hospitalised with a serious back injury.

Investigators say they will prepare a coroner's report.

'The investigation is in its infancy at the moment and we will interview a number of people and conduct a number of inquiries to determine what happened,' said Inspector Paul Nicholls.
