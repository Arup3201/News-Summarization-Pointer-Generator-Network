Manchester United's Under 21 side  played 3-5-2 on Friday evening as the young Red Devils beat Norwich City 3-0 in their first game of the season.

Louis van Gaal's philosophy appears to be filtering down to Warren Joyce's group in the under-21 group to prepare players for the first-team and ensure that they are comfortable with the high demands of the 3-5-2 system.

It is also understood that the Under 18 group have experimented with the system in training and in some pre-season games.

Tom Lawrence, who was given his first-team debut by Ryan Giggs at the end of last season, tapped the hosts ahead at Leigh Sports Village reacting quickest after Norwich goalkeeper Ben Killip did well to keep out United's initial effort.

Northern Irish defender Patrick McNair doubled United's advantage before Joshua Harrop curled the ball into the net to complete the 3-0 victory.

Nick Powell, who spent last season on loan at Wigan, started the match as did David Moyes' first signing at the club, Guillermo Varela.
