Parents want to believe their babies are capable far more than their young age would suggest, but a company that claimed it would teach infants to read is being sued for hundreds of millions of dollars.

For years, consumers were peppered with infomercials and internet ads claiming that parents and caregivers could give their youngsters 'Your Baby Can Read' products.

The company claimed the program was essentially 'supercharging' their brains in order for them to learn more whilst becoming confident and proficient readers.

A load of nonsense: Your Baby Can Read, created by Dr. Robert Titzer, raked in more than $185 million from the sales of its $200 kits

It was even suggested that toddlers would be reading Harry potter novels by the ages of three or four.

However, the federal government has decided it was all a load of nonsense.

In a settlement announced Friday by the Federal Trade Commission, the founder of 'Your Baby Can Read,' Dr. Robert Titzer, along with his company, Infant Learning, agreed to judgments of more than $185 million to resolve charges filed by the agency alleging the program had no scientific evidence to make the claims.

Outside research, however, shows it's unlikely kids will be able to read by the time they start preschool.

 What's more, a recent study out of New York University finds that babies don't develop any reading skills when they're exposed to reading-readiness products like DVDs, flash cards and flipbooks.

Read after me: The program made claims in ads, infomercials, and on social media that it could teach babies to read as early as nine months out of the womb

Most children learn to read on their own by the time they're 7 years old, although some learn a bit earlier.

The company claimed that through the 'Your Baby Can Read' flash cards, lift-a-flap books and videos that as early children as young as nine-months-old could start to read. The program cost about $200.

The FTC settled on that figure because $185 million was amounted to Infant Learning's gross sales from Baby Can Read.

The company that marketed the program went out of business in 2012 when the agency first took action against it.

No proof: The FTC said the makers of YBCR lacked competent and reliable scientific evidence showing the program could teach babies to read, or that the program helped very young children of a preschool age

However, the FTC said it was still selling copies of the program online after that time.

'Marketers and expert endorsers must have adequate substantiation for the claims they make, and the FTC will continue to pursue those who fail to abide by this basic rule,' FTC Consumer Protection Director Jessica Rich said in a statement.

Parents have are advised that simply because the FTC has debunked the marketing claims of 'Your Baby Can Read' doesn't mean you should stop reading to your baby.

The American Academy of Pediatrics released a policy statement this year for all parents to crack a book open with their little ones early and often, since research has shown children who are read to during the infant, toddler and preschool years have better language skills when school starts.
