Opposition Leader Bill Shorten blasted the government's instability this morning, after taking a cheery and almost certainly staged walk past the Liberal Party's leadership meeting.

Mr Shorten, Deputy Leader Tanya Plibersek and Senators Penny Wong and Stephen Conroy clutched coffees and laughed among themselves as they strolled past the assembled media pack. 

'Tony Abbott promised he would run a stable and united government,' said Mr Shorten, who is more than familiar with a leadership crisis, given he played a pivotal role in knifing prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. 'This is his biggest broken promise yet.' 

Prime Minister Tony Abbott managed to cling to power during Monday morning's meeting, defeating a spill motion led by rebellious backbenchers 61 votes to 39.

Casual walk by: Labor leaders laughed amongst themselves and sipped their coffees as they strode past the media assembled near the Liberal party spill meeting

Survivor: Mr Abbott survived the spill motion, 61 votes to 39, but his grip on the party leadership appears tenuous

Winning position? Mr Shorten is well ahead in the latest opinion polls, more than a year-and-a-half out from the next scheduled federal election

But Mr Shorten has reason to celebrate given grim polling for Mr Abbott overnight. 

The latest Newspoll showed Labor was ahead of the Coalition 57 points to 43 on a two-party preferred basis.

The Newspoll also found the Labor leader was preferred prime minister by 48 per cent to Mr Abbott's 30 per cent. 

However, the political landscape would likely be less rosy for Labor if Malcolm Turnbull ascends to the Liberal leadership in the coming months, according to a weekend poll. 

The Galaxy poll found the Liberals under Mr Turnbull would narrow the gap to 51 - 49 two party preferred, still in Labor's favour.  

Labor spokespeople have honed their attacks on Mr Turnbull in recent days, with Mr Shorten saying Mr Turnbull 'may have a nicer suit than Tony Abbott... (but they) are cut from the same cloth.' 

Prime Minister Tony Abbott did not take questions from the media today but will likely face a grilling in an interview on ABC's 7:30 program tonight
