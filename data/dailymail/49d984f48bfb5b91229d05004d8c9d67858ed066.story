Search warrants reveal that Jim DiMaggio had tortured and killed his two victims before he drove off with the kidnapped teen.

A police report that describes the scene that firefighters found when they responded to the call about DiMaggio's cabin being burnt to ashes in Boulevard, California on August 5th.

They found the bodies of Christina Anderson and her six-year-old son Ethan covered with tarp, and a crowbar lying next to Christina.

What remained: Firefighters found the bodies of Christina and Ethan Anderson covered with tarp, showing that they were killed before the fire that burnt down Jim DiMaggio's Boulevard cabin (pictured)

When the responders went to the garage to check for more victims, they found the Anderson's deceased dog and noted that it had blood near its head.

The details surrounding the nature of the bodies are scant, but the fact that the humans were draped with tarp before the firefighters got there- and that there was blood coming from the dog's head- implies that they were all killed before the fire ravaged the home.

Killer: Jim DiMaggio lured the Andersons to his home before taking off with Hannah

This comes in contrast to what Hannah Anderson told friends on social media after she was freed by FBI officials who found her with DiMaggio in Idaho.

When asked about their deaths on her Ask.fm account, Hannah said taht 'he tied them up in the garage'.

In another post she said DiMaggio had rigged the house with explosives that went off when they were on the road, so she was not aware that her mother and brother had been killed until she was told by an FBI agent an Idaho hospital after her rescue.

After fielding hundreds of questions from both strangers and friends, Hannah shut down her Ask.fm page and has only been communicating with her newfound fans via Instagram, so there has not been a chance for her to publicly clarify what she knew, and when.

As for the immediate police version of events, their conclusions are clear. In the report, they stated that 'after the double homicide, DiMaggio set the house on fire'.

The police reports were filed on August 5, the day after the ordeal began, when DiMaggio was on the road with Hannah, Christina's 16-year-old daughter.

Two search warrants were released on Wednesday, showing what led investigators to seek permission to go to the Anderson's home and retrieve evidence in the hopes of piecing together DiMaggio's connection to the family.

Their initial point of investigation was
DiMaggio's phone records, which showed that he and Hannah Anderson had 
13 phone conversations in the days and weeks leading up to her 
abduction.

Victims: Hannah posted both of these photos, dedicated to her late mother and brother, after she was taken back to California. Police now say that Christina (left) and Ethan (right) were tortured and killed before the fire

Giving a smile: Hannah Anderson posted this photo of herself on Instagram on Wednesday, and in the caption she wrote that 'God give his toughest tasks to the strongest soldiers' before ending with a personalized hashtag, #hannahstrong

Reliving the past: She posted this picture of her dog who also died in the fire alongside her mother and brother, and the number of likes and comments she received shows her growing following

One search warrant details how a firefighter 'noticed a green tarp on the ground near the door with human feet sticking out of the tarp. He lifted the tarp and saw the bottom half of a human torso, legs, and feet.'

'Captain Gutgesell said that he saw the human body was face down and noticed the tarp was partially melted to the head, and what appeared to be human hair. Captain Gutgesell also saw a crow bar and what appeared to be blood on the ground next to the head.

'As ... personnel worked their way through the burnt-out structure on Ross Avenue in Boulevard, they found the burnt remains of a small child. The remains could not be identified at the scene due to their condition.'

The timing is critical when looking for clues in the police reports, because the forms were filled out by police who were describing the crime scene in order to have a judge grant them search warrants so that they could collect evidence from the Anderson's home to get a clearer understanding of the relationship between the two families.

The list of evidence collected at the Anderson house shows that investigators found a photo of DiMaggio in one of the Anderson bedrooms.

Threats: Hannah said that her captor, James 'Uncle Jim' DiMaggio threatened her with a rifle

Uncle Jim: This family photo taken in 2011 shows how close DiMaggio (far right) was with the Andersons. Hannah is seen laying across her relatives, Ethan with his hand in the air on the floor, and Christina is the furthest left woman

When they began speaking with friends and relatives, they learned that Hannah felt that DiMaggio had a 'crush' on her, so they began pursuing that line of investigation.

Once she was rescued on Saturday in Idaho after being spotted by a group of horseback riders, Hannah spoke out to friends and strangers on social media who posed questions about the ordeal.

'He
tricked us,' one post on her Ask.fm account said. She explained 
that DiMaggio told the Andersons to come over and ride go carts on his 
property. Once they arrived, he tied up her mother and brother and fled 
by car with Hannah.Â 

'I will never forgive myself for not trying harder to save them,' another post read.

Close: DiMaggio, 40, is pictured with 16-year-old Hannah, and phone records show that they exchanged 13 phone calls prior to the abduction and house fire

One user asked why she did not try to run.

'He had a gun and threatened to kill me and anyone who tried to help,' she wrote.

She described it as 'more of a family crush like he had feelings as in he wanted nothing bad to happen to me'.

She didn't give any further insight 
into his motivation, saying that he killed her relatives and kidnapped 
her 'because he's a psycho'.
