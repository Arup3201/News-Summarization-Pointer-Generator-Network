It's a good yarn that's certainly one to be re-told by pro skier turned sheep rescuer Pete Oswald. 

The 29-year-old was on Hector Mountain, south of New Zealand's South Island, when he noticed 'a little bundle of wool' snowballing down the slopes which then landed 100 metres away from him.

The New Zealand native skied over to the ewe to discover that it was bleeding from its nose. And so began his rescue mission.

Pete Oswald rescues a 40kg sheep stranded high up in the snowy mountains in New Zealand

The 29-year-old was on location for a photo shoot when he noticed 'a little bundle of wool' snowballing down the mountains

The semi-pro skier says it was a difficult ride down and he nearly fell over a few times

'It was trying to walk but was totally exhausted. It wouldn't have survived if I had left it there,' he told The Marlborough Express.

The sheep was fine when it reached flat grassy land

He was with photographer Dan Power, setting up for their last day photo shoots, when a piece of snow fell on Oswald's ski boots.

He glanced over and noticed the sheep sliding down the slopes.

Seeing that the animal was injured, he lifted its 40kg body weight and held it by its legs as he skied down slowly to safety. 

'It was really hard to ski, there was a lot of wool in my face when I carried it,' he said.

It was a challenging ride down for Oswald, who says he nearly fell over a number of times before they reached grassy.

After a good feed, the sheep went on its way - seemingly untroubled by its potentially near death experience.

Oswald is not stranger to the woolly mammal as he grew up on a sheep farm in Marlborough - northeast of the South Island.

He began skiing at five-years-old and is now a semi-professional skier.

He is also a cinematographer based in Austria.

Oswald told The Marlborough Express he has come across mountain goats, marmots and bears whilst on skiing trips but the sheep by far is the best.
