This is the photo of a romantic kiss which got a pair of Moroccan teenagers arrested for being a 'danger to social order'.

Police detained the couple, aged 14 and 15, for 'public indecency' after the image they posted on Facebook was picked up and printed by a local paper.

But the incident spawned a wide online protest against Morocco’s authoritarian Muslim regime under the hashtag #Nadorkiss.

'Gross indecency': Police arrested these teenagers after this photograph of them kissing outside their school in Nador, Morocco, was posted on Facebook

The
 photo - blurred to protect the young couple's identify - was reposted 
on a twitter account for a Moroccan-based arm of Anonymous, a global 
group of so-called hacktivists which claims to campaign for freedom 
from censorship. 

On their twitter account they mocked authorities for their clampdown, adding: 'THIS is the kiss..THIS is what the Gov feels is destroying the Nat'l order and social harmony of Morocco'.

A campaign is now spreading across social
 networks to defend the right of public displays of affection which are restricted in the conservative country.

Dozens of protesters staged a kiss-in 
to show their solidarity with the teenagers and posted pictures of their
 own kisses on twitter.

One twitter user posted: '#NadorKiss 
is not just about the three kids who are facing jail, it is about the 
right to freedom online in repressive societies.'

Another
 wrote: 'Does a simple kiss really impose a threat to the National order
 and social harmony to the extent of arresting the kids involved? 
#NadorKiss'

The couple, as well as the boy who took the photo outside their school in the town of Nador, were arrested after a local newspaper printed the image.

The
 three youngsters are all due in court today for a closed hearing, 
followed by a sentencing next week, according to the Agence France-Presse.

They are currently being held at a juvenile detention centre for violating public decency.

A sit-in has begun outside the centre to demand their release.

Human Rights organisations said the incident has provoked scores of 'copycat' posts - with the BBC reporting a campaign to post a million copycat photos has been launched in protest.

Chakib al-Khayari, president of the Rif Association of Human Rights said: '[the incident] involves a teenage boy and his girlfriend.

'They were arrested on Thursday for violating public decency by posting a photo of them kissing.'

A local official has confirmed the arrests, but declined to comment.
