Scientists have sequenced the genome of an extinct group of humans which spread around the world 100,000 years ago, using a small fragment of a human finger bone found in a cave in Siberia.

The new, high-resolution genome scan will allow scientists to study how present-day humans evolved from our ancestors.

It was sequenced from DNA extracted from a tiny sample - 10mg - of fossilised finger bone.

Along with the Neanderthals, the Denisovans are the closest extinct relatives of modern humans.

‘We hope that biologists will be able to use this genome to
discover genetic changes that were important for the development of modern
human culture and technology.These changes enabled modern humans to leave Africa and
rapidly spread around the world, starting around 100,000 years ago’ says Dr. Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute.

The genome represents the first high-coverage, complete
genome sequence of one of our ancestors.

Its creators describe it as 'a leap in the study of extinct
forms of humans.'

The researchers had previously sequenced the genome at a lower resoulution using the fossil.

The earlier genome allowed researchers to find, for instance, that present-day inhabitants of New Guinea have 4.8 per cent Denisovan DNA.

This tooth, thought to have come from a five to seven-year-old child, was found in the same cave, and was the first evidence of the existence of Denisovans - now thought to be a crucial 'key' to tracing man's evolution

The new technique allowed the researchers to sequence every position in the Denisovan genome 30 times over, a far more detailed scan, according to a paper published in the journal PLoS One.

‘The genome is of very high quality’, says Dr. Matthias
Meyer.

‘We sequenced it so many times
that it has fewer errors than most genomes from present-day humans.'

This level of resolution
was sufficient to establish the relationship of Denisovans to Neandertals and
present-day humans, but often made it impossible for researchers to study the
evolution of specific parts of the genome.

 The now-completed version of the
genome allows even the small differences between the copies of genes that this
individual inherited from its mother and father to be distinguished.

The Leipzig group has now made the entire Denisovan genome sequence
available for the scientific community over the internet.

 The genome is also expected to reveal new aspects of the history of Denisovans
and Neandertals.

'We want to make it freely available to everybody already
now’ says Pääbo. ‘We believe that many scientists will find it useful in their
research’.

The finger bone was discovered by Professor Anatoly
Derevianko and Professor Michail Shunkov from the Russian Academy of Sciences
in 2008 during their excavations at Denisova Cave.

Human occupation at the site
is thought to have started up to 280,000 years ago.

The finger bone was found in a layer which has
been dated to between 50,000 and 30,000 years ago.
