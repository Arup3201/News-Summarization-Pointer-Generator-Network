One of the worst parts about failing your driving test is having to sheepishly tell friends and family about your crushing disappointment afterwards.

Hopefully, most people's parents are a little more sympathetic than the irate Irish father featured in a Youtube video that has quickly gone viral.

It was posted by Youtube user Ruairidoc and features the father's dramatic and expletive-filled rant after his son tells him he has failed his driving test.

'You failed the f****r?': A video of a father's angry reaction to his son failing his driving test has swept the internet. Left, the young man outlines his plan to film his father

He secretly films his father after getting in his car after his test and breaking the bad news.

'It was the hill start and the three-point turn. It was impossible,' he tells his father.

'You failed the f****r?' he responds. When his son confirms that this is indeed the case, he exclaims: 'For f***s sake Jesus Christ Almighty.'

He laments the 85 euro cost of taking the
 test and continues: 'You fail the first f*****g time, that's the start 
of it, you fail again and again and again.'

The rant is peppered with swear words and has now been seen more than a million times

'Ah no, I passed': The young man has fooled his father to see his reaction. The father is relieved to discover his son actually passed - but is not so happy about being filmed

He asks his son who the instructor was and is told it was a woman and his anger rises, asking 'why didn't you sweeten her up in some way?'

However, his son throws a twist into the tale - he actually passed.

The grinning youngster said: 'Ah no, I passed. And I'm recording you. You're going on Facebook.'

Although his father's relief is tangible, he continues haranguing his son, saying: 'Turn off that f*****g thing. Jesus Christ I thought you'd f*****g failed the b*****d.'

The video has now been viewed more than a million times.
