An Illinois man's homemade ice rink - located in his own backyard - is proving to be a hit with families and children in his community.

Tom Fox of Lakewood told WGN of his young daughter Sydney, explaining 'She's learning how to skate, and I played hockey growing up, and just always wanted one in the backyard, so I figured why not, you know?'

Fun for the family: Fox's ice rink measures 20 x 40 feet and is a hit with children 

'2 x 10s and then 2 x 8s hold in everything together,' he explained in an interview with the affiliate station. 'And then it's basically one big tarp you put all that on and then fill up with water and then let it freeze.'

WGN reported that there is foam around the 20 x 40 foot rink's wall, rubber mats for entering and exiting - plus overhead lights hanging outside.

'We got lights up in the trees and one over there in the swing set, and yeah, so the kids come out here after school and they skate all they want,' Fox told the affiliate station.

Fox also said that 'The whole neighborhood's coming out and enjoying it and having a lot of fun.'

'Zamboni': This homemade device helps resurface the ice on Tom Fox's backyard rink 

The father revealed his homemade 'Zamboni' meant to smooth the ice in the rink, telling WGN that the 'Zamboni is a nice little feature.'

Fox explained 'It's basically a garbage can, and then I plumbed it up with PVC pipe and filled it up with warm water, and just drag it around the rink and it resurfaces it.'

Speaking about the ice rink, Fox also said 'It already actually drained once, so it's a little hole. We tried to fill it up before Christmas and there was a hole in the liner and it all drained out so it never froze, so then the day after Christmas I filled it back up.

'I haven't seen the water bill,' he continued while laughing. 'Don't want to see the water bill.'

Six-year-old Sydney, meanwhile, told WGN that her favorite thing while using her ice skates is to 'Play hockey with my dad.'

WGN reported that an even larger ice rink is planned for 2016.
