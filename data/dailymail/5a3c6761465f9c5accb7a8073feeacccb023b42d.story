At least 50 sports fans were killed when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives vest in a crowd watching a volleyball tournament in east Afghanistan.

A further 50 people were injured after the bomber blew himself up in the middle of spectators watching an inter-district tournament in Yahyakahil, Paktika province.

Paktika provincial spokesman Mukhles Afghan said the explosion ripped through the crowd as they watched the tournament final. Most of the casualties were civilians, he said.

'The suicide attacker was on a motorcycle, he detonated himself in the middle of a volleyball match,' Attaullah Fazli, deputy governor of Paktika province, told AFP

'A lot of people including some provincial officials and the police chief were there. About 50 people have been killed, and 60 injured, a lot of them seriously.'

Mr Afgha told AP: 'There were too many people gathered in the one place to watch the game. Dozens of others are wounded and we have reports that many of them are in critical condition.

'We need urgent help from the central government because we might need to transfer wounded people to Kabul for treatment,' he added.

Paktika, bordering Pakistan, is one of Afghanistan's most volatile regions, where a Taliban-led insurgency is waging an intensifying war against the government in Kabul.

Today's attack is one of the deadliest so far this year, a time when attacks are escalating alongside a contentious election, the inauguration of President Ashraf Ghani in September, and the withdrawal of Western troops.

About 12,000 international troops will remain in Afghanistan next year to train and support Afghanistan's security forces.

The latest attacks come as it was revealed U.S. President Barack Obama signed a 'secret' order allowing the Pentagon to continue to target Taliban fighters even after the military withdrawal.

The president's decision, made during a White House meeting with national security advisers, also gives the military the green light to conduct air support for Afghan operations when needed.

Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks, as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close, thousands of troops return home, and the military prepares for narrower counterterrorism and training mission for the next two years.

Afghan lawmakers have also approved agreements with the U.S. and Nato allowing Western soldiers to remain in the country.

The international combat mission in Afghanistan, which began after the 2001 US-led invasion that toppled the Taliban, was due to conclude at the end of this year.
