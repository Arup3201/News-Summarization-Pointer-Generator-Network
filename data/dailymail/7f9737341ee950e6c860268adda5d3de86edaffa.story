NBC has announced that they plan to add one or two black female cast members to Saturday Night Live in the new year in response to the criticism over a lack of diversity on the sketch comedy show.

A representative for the network confirmed the news after backstage photos of 'secret' auditions for a select group of black comediennes leaked on social media earlier Thursday.

In recent weeks, the show has seen two dozen candidates in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.

Making history: Eleven black women were invited to audition for a spot on Saturday Night Live earlier this month in Los Angeles amid concerns that the show lacks diversity

The New York Times reported that a 
special audition for seven or eight finalists will be held Monday on the
'SNL' stage in Manhattan.

It's
'100 per cent good for the show to have an African-American woman' in 
its ranks, executive producer Lorne Michaels has said in earlier 
interviews.

The two current
black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to 
spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all
impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to 
dress in drag.

As a result,
there have been no sketches on the weekly program featuring First Lady 
Michelle Obama since Maya Rudolph left the cast in 2007.

The
only exception to this came in November when Scandal star Kerry 
Washington was the guest host amid the diversity furor and she played 
Mrs Obama, Oprah and Beyonce in the same sketch as the show's way of 
poking fun at themselves.

'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Rudolph who is biracial.

'It's
not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview 
with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure 
it will happen.'

News of 
the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles
and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage
hit the internet.

Actress 
Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes
asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance.

Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live
has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the 
1985-86 season on the show

No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since

'It was an awesome opportunity even 
though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta 
get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com.

'I
can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having 
no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of 
course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle 
Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there
that I had never met,' she said.

Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie 
Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe 
also auditioned according to Jezebel.

Laughing at themselves: When Kerry Washington hosted the show last month, the first skit made fun of the lack of black female cast members on the show by having Washington play Michelle Obama and Oprah in the same skit

Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past

'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said.

'We
were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being 
considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the 
showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed 
to the max.'

Webb says she was invited to audition last summer, but was filming a television show and wasn't able to perform.

One
of the comediennes- Brunson- has a fan on the inside, as Pharoah has 
publicly lobbied for her to get one of the coveted spots.

'Why do I think she should be on the 
show? Because she's black first of all, and she's really talented. She's
amazing. She needs to be on SNL. I said it. And I believe they need to 
follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year,' 
Pharoah told The Grio.

The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the upcoming departure of Seth Meyers, who will leave mid-way through this season to replace Jimmy Fallon as the host of Late Night.

One of the women who auditioned could be on the show as early as this season as Seth Meyers is in the new year to host Late Night
