Iain Harrison confessed to the attempted murder of his terminally ill mother. He told his psychiatrist two years after Hope Harrison, 74, died he had smothered her - and had been consumed with guilt ever since

A man has avoided jail after he tried to murder his terminally ill mother by smothering her with a pillow in an act of attempted euthanasia.

Iain Harrison, 50, from Weymouth, Dorset, pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of 74-year-old Hope Harrison.

A court heard how Mrs Harrison had been diagnosed with lung cancer and 
was admitted to the Dorset County Hospital, Dorchester, in March 2011 
when her condition worsened.

Mrs Harrison died on April 2. Doctors assumed 
she had passed away naturally and her death 
certificate recorded the cause as a small valve obstruction and cancer.

However, two years later Harrison confessed to a psychiatrist he had smothered his mother and he had been 'consumed with guilt after killing his mother by suffocating her' ever since.

The police were called in and Mr Harrison
 was charged with attempted murder as there was no medical evidence that
 he actually caused her death, despite his admission.

He was sentenced at Winchester Crown Court to a two-year prison term, suspended for 18 months, today.

The court heard how, on 29 March 2011, Mrs Harrison, whose cancer had spread and was in a great deal of pain, was admitted to hospital and was expected to die within a couple of days.

Seeing her suffering in pain, Mr 
Harrison asked a nurse if there was anything they ‘could do’ for her and
 was told they could only make her comfortable.

The nurse made a note of his request in the log at 8pm on April 2, 2011. Mrs Harrison died on the same evening.

Following her death Harrison became depressed and attempted to commit suicide. He also had professional help from a psychiatrist - to whom he made his confession.

John Locke, senior crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wessex, told the court how, although it could not be proven Harrison had killed his mother, his confession was enough for a prosecution.

He said: 'This is a very sad case, where a son admitted carrying out an act that amounted to the attempted murder of his terminally ill mother because he could not bear seeing her suffering.

'As distressing as it is to see a loved one suffering and dying from cancer or a terminal illness, it is not for a person to decide when someone should die. Euthanasia is effectively murder and murder is a crime.

'The court heard how Hope Harrison, 74, was diagnosed with lung cancer in late 2010 and that the prognosis was that she had not long to live.

'On March 29 2011 she was admitted to Dorset County Hospital after her condition worsened. Her cancer had spread elsewhere in her body and she was in great pain.

'It was felt by her consultant that she would not benefit from surgical intervention; she was to be kept as comfortable as possible as her death was inevitable.

'The nurse in attendance at the time entered in her log book that Mrs Harrison’s 50-year-old son Iain was at her side and asked the nurse to help his mother as she was in great pain. Mrs Harrison was given morphine and midazolam.

'Mr Harrison asked the nurse if there was anything he could do, and the nurse told him that they could only make her comfortable and the only thing he needed to do was to be on her side when she eventually passed away. Mrs Harrison died on the evening of April 2 2011.

'Mr Harrison started to see a psychiatrist as following the death of his mother he suffered from depression.

'On two occasions he tried to commit suicide and he seriously injured himself by jumping from the window of his fourth floor flat. On February 21 2013 he confessed to this psychiatrist he was consumed with guilt after killing his mother by suffocating her.

'He then called the police who arrested him. He made the same confession to the police after declining to have a solicitor.

'After a careful and thorough review of all the evidence in this case, I decided that there was sufficient evidence and it was in the public interest to charge Mr Harrison with an offence of attempted murder, an offence that he pleaded guilty to on February 21 2014.

'Mrs Harrison’s consultant said that her death was inevitable and it was therefore not possible for the prosecution to prove that her son had actually killed her.

'However it was possible to prove that he attempted to do so, based on his own admission.'
