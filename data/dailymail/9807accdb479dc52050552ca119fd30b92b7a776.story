A tiny beach hut with no running water or electricity has sold for more than £22,500 despite only measuring 10 foot by seven foot.

The green hut in Ferring, West Sussex has been sold, subject to contract, after estate agent Symonds Reading received a bid for the shed close to the asking price.

The shed is said to have views overlooking a shingle beach and the English Channel and is within close walking distance to a popular beach cafe.

But despite the estate agent admitting that the property is little more than a garden shed, they say that many people are interested in owning a small beach front hut.

This is even though for the same price, the buyer could purchase a one bedroom flat in Sheffield with a separate kitchen, lounge and bathroom.

Roger Curtis, manager at Symonds Reading said: 'It's not plumbed in and doesn't have electricity so it's just little more than a garden shed on the beach.

'But people love them and at the moment have the money for them.

'They just want to have their own little place by the sea.'

Beach huts originated as an evolution of the traditional Victorian bathing machines and are often now fully furnished and in high demand.

Earlier this month a wooden hut in Southwold, Suffolk was put up for sale for £100,000, with any potential new owners given a 30 year lease by the council.

While in March, a beach hit on Mudeford Spit in Christchurch in Dorset went on the market for £150,000.
