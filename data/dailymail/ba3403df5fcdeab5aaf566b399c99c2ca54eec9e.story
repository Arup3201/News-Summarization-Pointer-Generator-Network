Commuters desperate for the lavatory on this Polish cross-country train had no choice but to put their needs on ice.

It got so cold on the Szczezin to Warsaw service this week that the train's toilet completely froze over, leaving chilly travellers to hack through three inches of snow and ice before they could answer the call of nature.

'The carriage was absolutely freezing - about minus 3 degrees - so I was huddled up with other passengers trying to keep warm,' said Artur Kaminski, 68, who took the snaps. 'Then I went to use the toilet - and was confronted with this.'

Fellow passenger Agnieszka Mucha got cold comfort when she tried complaining to the conductor.

'I went to see if they could turn the 
heating on and he told me, It's an old train - at least there isn't snow
in the carriage,' she said.

Railway officials have blamed a faulty window seal for the frosty reception.

Spokesman Michal Stilger said: 'We have different trains and carriages of different ages. They are all safe and efficient.'

'If passengers report snow inside the train we remove it,' he added.
