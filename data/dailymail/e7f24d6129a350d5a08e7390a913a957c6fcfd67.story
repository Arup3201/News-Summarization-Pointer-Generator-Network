This is the amazing moment when an adult female cheetah and her six cubs frolic in the Masai Mara national reserve in Kenya. 

Wildlife photographer Majed Sultan Ali, 35, from Kuwait captured the wonderful scenes with his telephoto lens while on safari. 

The coalition of cheetahs was playing beside an old log. The two-week-old cubs were busy learning many of the hunting skills necessary to survive on the African plains.

These adorable two-week-old cheetah cubs spent an afternoon playing and frolicking in the Masai Mara game reserve in Kenya when they were spotted by a safari tour

Mr Ali first tried to photograph cheetah cubs in 2007 on an earlier visit to Kenya but was unable to find any.

He said: 'My first safari was in 2007 and I was quite unsuccessful with regards to capturing cubs,' said Mr Ali, who has been a professional photography since 2006.

'I have tried photographing cheetah cubs since then but still never got the chance. To then have six cubs to shoot was amazing. It was even better having the chance to have all six in one frame.'

As part of the set of photographs, Mr Ali captured the cheetah mother interacting with her cubs, allowing them to use her as a climbing frame.

Although, even though the cubs were only two months old it was clearly evident that they are skilled predators.

According to Mr Ali, unfortunately one of the cubs died the night after he took this wonderful set of photographs

He said: 'As it is the first time I have seen a cheetah with her cubs, I really feel like this is my first safari, I couldn't stop taking photos of every action of these cubs.

'I really liked the photo where one of the cubs jumps over one of the others. The first time I saw them they were shy but the longer I spent with them, they started coming closer to us.'

As Mr Ali continued photographing the family, they began devouring their dinner. 

He said photographing the cheetahs from such a long distance was quite tricky as he needed to predict the cubs' next move.

These two cubs are using its mother as a form of step ladder who keeps a watching eye out for any potential danger from lurking predators hiding in the long grass

Even though they are among the most effective killing machines on the African plains, sometimes even a cheetah needs some love

He added: 'The cubs are only about two weeks old. Unfortunately, one of the cubs died but I was not told the reason behind its death other than it may have been killed by a lion or hyena.'

'If you want to freeze a frame or you want to make a motion effect like panning, you should always be ready for any action and take several shots so that you will not skip any frame.

'Understanding the behaviour of the animal also helps you to expect what the animal may do by reading its body language.

This cheetah cub instantly betrays the fact that it is in reality a highly skilled hunter, suited to tracking its prey across the Masai Mara game reserve

These two cheetah cubs show why they have the reputation as one of the fastest animals on the planet after they race across the grass at high speed

These three cheetah cubs looked primed to pounce on each other as they develop the techniques needed to become a successful predator like their mother

Sometimes a busy cheetah cub needs to take some time out of its schedule to lean against a section of three and watch the world go by
