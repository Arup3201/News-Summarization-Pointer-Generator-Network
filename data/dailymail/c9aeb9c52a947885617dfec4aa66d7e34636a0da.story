Dublin found itself at the centre of an Ebola scare after a woman was rushed to hospital displaying symptoms of the deadly disease and immediately placed in isolation.

The patient, who had recently returned from West Africa, underwent tests at the Mater Hospital today and the Ebola virus has been ruled out.

It is understood that the woman was admitted to the National Isolation Unit as a precaution after being considered 'a low risk for the Ebola Virus'.

Gardai and ambulance crews shut down Berkley Road in Tyrrelstown, Dublin, in a suspected Ebola case 

The Health Service Executive (HSE) said that it 'must, and does, take each Ebola scenario seriously no matter how low the risk.' 

'All appropriate infection control procedures are being taken by all relevant healthcare personnel,' a statement from HSE added.

The woman, who was taken ill at her flat in the Dublin suburb of Tyrrelstown, is believed to have recently returned from Nigeria, which was today declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organisation, having had no new cases for 42 days.

HSE said that the patient is receiving appropriate treatment at the Mater Hospital and public health protocols have been, and are being, put in place. 

Witnesses reported that ambulance crew, and other staff wore protective gear throughout the investigation

The HSE in Ireland said that it 'must, and does, take each Ebola scenario seriously no matter how low the risk'

Witnesses reported that ambulance crew, and other staff wore protective gear throughout the investigation. 

Large areas surrounding the hospital were shut down in accordance with procedures outlined by Health Minister Leo Varadkar, last week.

The HSE statement said: 'There are no known cases of Ebola in Ireland presently', before adding that the 'overall risk of a case of Ebola being brought into in Ireland is low'.

'The HSE welcomes the fact that the WHO has removed Nigeria from the list of Ebola affected countries,' the statement continued.

'If a case is confirmed in Ireland, the primary concerns will be treatment of the patient and containing the situation.' 

Outside West Africa, the spread of the deadly disease has been confirmed in Spain and the United States. Possible cases have been investigated in several other countries, but none has yet turned out to be Ebola.

But in the three worst affected countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - 'new cases continue to explode in areas that looked like they were coming under control', WHO has said.

'An unusual characteristic of this epidemic is a persistent cyclical pattern of gradual dips in the number of new cases, followed by sudden flare-ups,' the organization added.

Latest figures from WHO put the number of people infected with Ebola worldwide at over 9,000, with the death toll topping 4,500.
