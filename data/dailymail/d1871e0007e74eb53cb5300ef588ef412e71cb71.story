New findings: Researchers have discovered that babies understand what their mums say - even though they don't know the language she is speaking

Babies understand what their mothers  say, even when they speak in a language their children have never heard before,    scientists claim.

They found one-year-olds reacted in exactly same way to their mother’s voice regardless of whether she was speaking in English or Greek.

It proves what mothers have long known – that babies pick up on tone of voice rather than the words.

The researchers, from Cardiff University’s School of Psychology, observed babies as they watched their mothers perform actions with toys using the English words ‘whoops’ and ‘there’.

The scientists studied reactions from one-year-old babies to their mum’s voice even when she was speaking either languages..

And the same process was repeated in Greek with the same tone in the voice.

The academics found that babies reproduced the same reaction regardless of whether they knew the language - proving it was all Greek to them.

Study leader Dr Merideth Gattis, of Cardiff University’s School of Psychology, said: 'What this work showed was that children could have access to understanding using simply the tone of voice.

'We did “whoops” and “there” in two languages and got exactly the same results - whether in English or Greek, which none of the children understood.'

The research published in the journal Cognitive Development was conducted with 84 babies, aged between 14 and 18 months, in Cardiff over the course of a year with none of the babies having any previous exposure to Greek.

Dr Gattis said that children respond to 'tone' clues in their parents’ speech from an early age.

She said: 'Tone of voice is a really useful signal to what someone is thinking.

'We never have access through to other people’s minds, except the signals in language that we give out.'

She said that the study results meant that it was less important what parents said, but 'how they said it'.

She said that even swearing, or anger could theoretically be 'covered up' by disguising tone - but that it was better to use another word in its place.

Dr Gattis said: 'It could be the child asks us if you like their drawing.

'You might say yes, but if you don’t sound enthusiastic, it could be that meaning doesn’t get across.

'At the stage of life before children get access to words and language, parents’ tone is exaggerated when speaking to babies.

'There is a group of parents that may not be as confident as other parents and feel very self-conscious.

'If a health visitor says: “Talk to the baby” sometimes these parents say that they don’t know what to say.

'But this study shows that they shouldn’t worry so much about what to say, but rather pay attention to the tone.'
