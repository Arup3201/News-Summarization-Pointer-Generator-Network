England's jubilant players were bounding out of the Cibalia Stadium, reflecting on an outstanding night, but Gareth Southgate was already looking forward.

It didn’t matter that England had sent records tumbling, from reaching a fifth consecutive appearance at the Under 21 European Championships to securing a 10th successive win, Southgate had already started contemplating another major issue.

Can England now start winning at a major tournament? Or, to be more specific, can they actually win a game against the best young players on the continent? Recent history, after all, has shown they have been anything but proficient in doing that.

Though they have been fixtures at the last four tournaments, reaching the final against Germany in Sweden in 2009, their win ratio has been miserable. They have played 14 matches in that period but been successful in just four of them.

What’s more, the last two tournaments, under Stuart Pearce’s watch, were wretched affairs, a two draws and a defeat in Denmark (in 2011) were followed by three straights losses in Israel (2013), in a group that contained the hosts, Norway and Italy they should ought to have negotiated.

Why did it go so wrong? Squad strength was an issue. Pearce had good reason to complain in Israel that he was dealt a bad hand, given the FA chairman of the time David Bernstein admitted there was more importance on a friendly in Brazil than the tournament in Israel.

That cost Pearce, primarily, the presence of Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

But it wasn’t just that. Pearce wanted to ensure his players stayed in first class facilities but choosing a plush golf complex in the middle of nowhere was not, in hindsight, a wise move for young men who were susceptible to boredom and the atmosphere suffered as a result.

Also, the fixtures they played before Israel were wrong. The FA tried to get decent opposition but they end up facing cakewalks against Northern Ireland, Sweden, Romania and Austria. Come that first match in Israel against Italy, England were undercooked.

Southgate, however, is savvy. He has fostered a remarkable close-knit spirit in his group and trusts them with responsibility. When away in Lithuania last month, he gave them down time, telling the players they were free to explore Kaunas on a day off. Not one of his squad abused that trust.

The set up at this moment in time is right and it should also be noted the impact that Southgate’s assistant Steve Holland makes, putting on sessions that the squad respond to. The chemistry is right between the two men and they command the squad’s respect.

Yet Southgate is also wise enough to know the only things that general public will be interested in next June is results. If England were to go to the Czech Republic and fall flat on their faces once more, nobody would be pay attention to the good work of the last 13 months.

That is why Southgate and his staff will leave no stone unturned going forward. Already friendlies have been lined up for next month against Portugal – a game which is set to be staged in Burnley – and France and tough opposition will be sought out for the international break in March.

So while he was immensely satisfied as he began the journey home on Tuesday night, a man who represented England on 57 caps occasions as a player was not prepared to sit back and admire what he had just seen. For Southgate, this has to be the start of a sustained spell of class.

‘I just want the players to keep knocking barriers down and perceptions down,’ said Southgate. ‘I know what I want an England team to look like and the challenge for us next summer is to go over there and prove that. We have got Portugal and France lined up to play in November.

They are the types of tests that we need. It was a bit like Toulon. That set us up for Croatia. We had to go through those defeats (lost to Brazil, Portugal) and learn when the right time was to kill the game, when was the right time to play and buy fouls. Our game management was really good.

‘What I really want is for us to go to the Czech Republic and play in the manner that we have been. It is difficult to do that (be exciting) in a qualifying tournament as the games are different. If we want to be successful, we have to be a possession based team.’
