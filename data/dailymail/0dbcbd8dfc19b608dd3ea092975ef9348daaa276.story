They were the magnificent men in their flying machines, risking their lives for the mother country.

And now, the diverse make-up of Britain's heroic air force during the World War One has been uncovered by newly-revealed records.

The records, digitised by family history website Findmypast.co.uk, reveal the history of the Royal Air Force in the Great War, from the first aerial troops in 1899, through the war and into World War Two.

Findmypast has worked with the National Archives to release nearly 450,000 service records of men of the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force, including 342,000 airmen's records never seen online before.

Made up of National Archives officers' service records and airmen's records, they contain information about their peacetime and military career, as well as physical descriptions, religious denominations and family statuses, with details of next of kin often included.

The records are forming part of Findmypast's 100 in 100 promise, which aims to deliver 100 record sets in 100 days.

Many date from 1912 with the formation of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and include men who continued to serve in the RAF until 1939, while the earliest date from 1899 with the Royal Engineers Balloon Service in the Boer War. The RAF was formed on April 1, 1918.

The files also show how the First World War brought together different levels of society, as well as people from all over the world.

More than 58 nationalities served in the RAF during the war, with men signing up from as far afield as India, Brazil, Japan, and Russia.

They include the first Indian to fly into combat, Hardutt Singh Malik, who became the only Indian aviator to survive the war despite ending up with bullet wounds to his legs that required several months' hospital treatment.

The newly-released records also reveal how working-class airmen flew side by side with officers, and were equally celebrated

After the war, he joined the Indian Civil Service, serving as the Indian ambassador to France, and after his retirement became India's finest golf player, even with two German bullets still embedded in his leg, according to Findmypast.

The newly-released records also reveal how working-class airmen flew side by side with officers, and were equally celebrated.

One flying ace Arthur Ernest Newland had humble origins as one of at least nine children from Enfield, north London, but went on to twice receive the Distinguished Flying Medal, ending the war having destroyed 19 enemy aircraft - 17 single-handedly.

John Cowell, one of 10 children from a poor family in Limerick, also became a celebrated airman during the war.

Between May 5 and July 28 1917, Cowell scored 15 victories as a gunner, and was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal on June 11 1918, as well as the Military Medal with Bar.

Returning as a pilot in 20 Squadron he scored his final victory a year and a day after his 15th but was shot down and killed the next day by balloon buster Friedrich Ritter von Roth of Jasta 16.

With their peacetime occupation in the records, they show another side of the drama of the First World War - with 104 actors, nine comedians and even one music hall artiste making up the RAF ranks.

Paul Nixon, military expert at Findmypast.co.uk, said: 'It's a real treat to have such an extensive set of records about the everyday airmen of World War One.

'These people, drawn from all walks of life, and from all over the world, played an incredibly important part in shaping our history, particularly in the development of aerial warfare.

'To have many of these hitherto unseen records easily accessible online for the first time mean that now many people can discover the Biggles in their own family.'

William Spencer, author and principal military records specialist at The National Archives, said: 'These records reveal the many nationalities of airmen that joined forces to fight in the First World War.

'Now these records are online, people can discover the history of their ancestors, with everything from their physical appearance right through to their conduct and the brave acts they carried out which helped to win the war.'
