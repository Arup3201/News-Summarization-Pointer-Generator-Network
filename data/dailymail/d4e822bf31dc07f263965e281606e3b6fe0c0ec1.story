A six-year-old girl from Pittsburgh took her mother's BMW for a drive yesterday, crashing it into two cars and a utility pole as she attempted to reach her father who lives across town. 

The unidentified child from Lawrenceville was lucky not to be hurt after she sneaked out with her mother's keys as she slept around 9am Sunday.

The child, described by police as tall for her age, managed to start the vehicle and drive it half a mile on the city's icy roads before she collided with two parked vehicles and hit a utility pole head-on.

Sorry mom! The 6-year-old hit two parked cars and a utility pole on her ill-fated journey to try and reach her father who lives in a town outside the city

Rommie Hawkins said he was shoveling snow when he saw the vehicle coming towards him on  Stanton Avenue.

'I thought she was going to hit me, but then she stopped just in time , and as I observed, she was this little kid,' he told WTAE Pittsburgh.

'I was like, 'Stop, stop, stop.' She looked at me, and she took back off and she stopped again, so I started running up the hill, telling her to stop, and she was going and stopping, going and stopping'.

Her mother awoke to find her child and car missing and called the police.

Scared: Rommie Hawkins was almost hit by the 6-year-old as she tried to drive her mother's BMW. He chased after the girl and managed to get her to stop

The girl had clambered out of the wreck of the vehicle, without a scratch, but was crying and asking for her father.

Police Sgt. Jerry Parker said: 'The girl decided she wanted to visit her father, who lived in a different location. She picked up the car keys and got in the car and drove away.

'How she knew how to operate a car - your guess is as good as mine.'

Police contacted the child's father, who she was so desperate to see, and he met them at the scene of the accident.

Police say they are still investigating and are yet to decide on whether to press charges against her mother for allowing little girl to leave her care.

It isn't the first time a child has been found having taken a car.

In 2008 a Florida boy aged 7 took his grandmother's SUV and hit two mailboxes, two parked cars and two oncoming vehicles before being brought to a standstill.
