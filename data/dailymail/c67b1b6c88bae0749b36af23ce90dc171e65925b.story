The man said Josie Connors made him sing to her child after he was punched and shut in a car boot

A 'vulnerable' man allegedly forced into unpaid labour by a family of travellers was shoved into the boot of a car and made to sing to his captor's child, a jury heard today.

The man - who cannot be named for legal reasons - claimed he was punched in the face before being told to sing How Much Is That Doggy In The Window? and the Bob the Builder theme tune.

He said he was treated 'like a slave' during the six months he spent with the Connors family at the Greenacres site near Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, and was told he would be murdered if he tried to leave.

Luton Crown Court heard the man escaped on July 18 last year by flagging down a police car while he was out canvassing for the Connors' block paving business.

The jury was told the man raised the alarm about conditions at the site and on September 11 last year the police found 13 workers housed in caravans, sheds and even a horse box.

Frances Oldham, for the Crown Prosecution Service, earlier told the jury: 'The Crown’s case is that members of the Connors family - initially father Tommy senior, and gradually over the past 15 years children Johnny, Jimmy, Josie, Tommy and Patrick and son in law James John - recruited vulnerable adults as workers on the pretence of offering them paid employment, food and accommodation.

'Typically recruitment would take place at centres for the homeless, soup kitchens or simply on the street.'

She alleged the Connors family made large amounts of money by controlling and exploiting the vulnerable men. Over 15 years they are said to have kept dozens of victims in camps and ordered them not to leave.

Their heads were shaved, they were paid little or nothing, were verbally abused and sometimes beaten, it was alleged. One worker described it as being 'like a concentration camp'.

Mrs Oldham said: 'A number of words may spring to mind to mind to describe what was happening. They may not in the strict sense have been slaves but they were not free men.'

Today the jury heard a recorded interview with a man who said that in January or February last year he was on the street outside a Greggs bakery in Wembley, north London, when he was approached by Josie Connors and her husband Jim.

He told the police they asked if he wanted work as a labourer for £80 a day.

He said it sounded like good money and went to live in a caravan at the Greenacres site with two other men.

The man described Jim Connors as being of big build with curly hair.

He
told police: 'He was Irish. He always seemed moody - he was horrible. 
Even his face is horrible. He is always aggressive, always shouting.'

Josie Connors, whom he described as having long blonde hair, would 'try to make fools out of everyone,' he said.

The
man said Jim Connors called him his son and that his alleged captors 
introduced him to other members of the family as their 'little cousin'. 
But, he said: 'They still treated my like a slave. I felt worse than a 
slave.'

He told officers that the Connors threatened that if he tried to escape they would get another of the workers to murder him.

'Jim and Josie look for beggars and make slaves out of them,' he was heard to say.

The
man, who was being helped to find a flat in Wembley by social services 
at the time he was recruited, said nobody would have known he was at 
Greenacres.

When he arrived at the caravan park, which he was told was in Luton, not near Leighton Buzzard, he said he was put in a small caravan with an older man and a black man, who was to later walk out.

The jury heard he was told to wash outside using an outdoor tap, whereas he described the Connors’ caravan next door as a 'palace'.

He said he was given egg sandwiches to eat most days, while the workers occasionally got sausage and chips and some days had nothing.

'It is horrible not eating,' he said.

Describing his work he said: 'I was working from six o’clock in the morning to ten o’clock at night. It was hard labour - mainly block paving using heavy tools. It made my back ache.'

He told police Jim Connors had given him a black eye on two occasions and had once kicked him in the testicles 'for standing around and doing nothing'.

When the workers were out on jobs, the man said, customers would ask if Jim Connors was the boss because he was the one who sat in a car reading the newspaper.

'We worked seven days a week. We would get no rest at all,' he said.

Once he had finished working on driveways, he said, he was made to clean the site at night dressed only in T-shirt and shorts.

On one occasion, the man who said he used to be a professional window cleaner, had been told to clean the Connors’ caravan window 5 or 6 times because he had not done it properly.

'I had been mentally tortured and punished,' he said.

Another time he was allegedly put in the boot of the Connors’ car, about a month after he joined them. He said he had been out canvassing for work but was punched because he had failed to get any customers.

He said: 'I had been out canvassing the whole day. I didn’t manage to get any customers. Jim pulled up in the car and said "What have you been doing? Why haven’t you got any customers? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?"

'Jim punched me as hard as he could in the eye. It left quite a big bruise - it lasted for about a week.

'Then he shoved me in the boot of his car. He said "get in there". I went in head first. He quickly slammed down the boot.

'Josie was saying I had got to sing How Much is That Doggy in the Window? to her kid. I sang it and then she said I had got to sing Bob the Builder.'

When he was recruited, he said, his benefit money was taken.

He said: 'They said they would look after it. They said they had got to keep the money as we are one big family... I ain’t seen any money for six months. They took all my papers off me.'

The man said he fled while out canvassing in Leighton Buzzard and hid in a garage before flagging down a passing police car on July 18 last year.

'I weren’t doing very well and didn’t get any jobs,' he said.

'I decided to run off and called the police for help.'

The jury heard Jim Connors had told the man to lie about how he was treated if he was ever stopped by police.

The man said: 'He said we are all a big family. If we were stopped by the police say they treated you well. I was to say I got paid £50 a day and we were a big happy family.'

The workers were given a speech to give potential customers while out canvassing for driveway work, he said.

While wearing a blue jacket with Kelly Construction on the back, a shirt and tie and orange cap he said they would have to say: 'Hello, sorry to disturb you. I am from Kelly Construction. We are building driveways. Would you like a free estimate? We can do you a really cheap deal.'

If somebody said 'yes' he would call Connors, who would go round and give the customer a quote.

He went on: 'The customer would say no at first but he would say "All the rest of the neighbours are having it done. Why don't you have it done? The machines are in the area, we can do it cheaply for you."'

The money was always collected by Connors at the end of the work.

'It was always cash. He took the customer to the bank,' he said.

On the police recording he said he was not getting paid and Connors would even take any tips from him.

Asked what would happen if customers rang up to complain, he said Connors would give the phone to the older man from his caravan, who would promise to sort out the problem.

'He would give a different name and say "Oh yeah, we will come and see you", but never bothered,' he said.

He said the work was in Harrow, Wembley, Enfield, Edmonton, Houghton Regis and 'a lot of places I didn't know'.

When questioned about being allowed time off for illness he said: 'I didn't get any time off. They said: "Travellers don't get ill. You are a traveller now. There is no such thing as illness. I had a stomach ulcer but Jim said: "Carry on and work. You are a traveller now."'

The man said workers were given steel-toe-capped boots but no goggles, ear muffs or gloves, even though they were using heavy and noisy machinery.

He will be cross-examined by defence lawyers via a live video link tomorrow.

Seven members of the Connors family, six of whom live at the Greenacres Caravan Park, together face a total of 20 charges including conspiracy to hold a person in servitude, actual bodily harm, battery and conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour.

The accused are: Tommy Connors Senior, 52; James 'Jimmy' Connors, 24; James John Connors ('Big Jim'), 34; Johnny Connors, 28; Tommy Connors Junior, 26; Patrick Connors, 20; and Josie Connors, 30.

The trial continues.
