A bullied schoolgirl who responded to having her locker robbed by spreading encouraging messages on Post-It notes - but was yelled at by her teachers for littering.

Caitlin Prater-Haacke, an 11th-grader who lives in a suburb of Calgary, Canada, had her school locker vandalized by bullies, who took her iPad and used it to post cruel messages on her Facebook.

But rather than retaliate, the student decided to spread happiness instead, and came into school last week armed with 850 Post-It notes covered in messages like 'You're awesome!' and 'Be yourself'.

Brave response: Caitlin Prater-Haacke, a Canadian 11th-grader, started her 'positive Post-It' campaign in response to being bullied

Love on the lockers: Caitlin had he locker broken into and cruel messages posted on her Facebook - but responded by putting encouraging notes on other students' lockers

She stuck the messages the locker of every student at George McDougall High School in Airdrie, Alberta, in the hope of making everybody smile.

But she was swiftly disciplined by her teachers, who classified the notes as litter.

Caitlin was pulled out of class, shouted at by staff and told that the school janitors are not there to clean up her mess, the Calgary Sun reported.

Yelled at: However, teachers disagreed with Caitlin's actions and told her off for putting up the notes

Her mother, Nicole Haacke, told the paper: 'I don't understand that when my kid is bullied, nothing happens, but when she tries to do something positive, she is punished.'

Caitlin said she wrote and stuck up the notes to 'do something positive', and because bullying at her school is 'not necessarily addressed'.

However, despite the reaction from school authorities, the wider community rallied round her and started spreading similar Post-Its around the town.

Fightback: However, other students rallied around Caitlin and gave her campaign extra momentum. Her teachers also changed their mind

Hashtag: The trend gathered momentum on social media as well

The trend spread to social media too, congregating under the #PositivePostIt hashtag. The Staples store in Airdrie even got in on the act, giving away the notes for free.

Caitlin's initiative culminated in a Positive Post-It Day event on Thursday - which her school supported.

Recanting their earlier position, teachers allowed their students to put up the messages - after they had promised to clean up after themselves.

George McDougall High School could not be reached for comment.
