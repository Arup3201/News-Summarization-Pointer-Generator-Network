A talented cricketer with 'the world at his feet', Phillip Hughes is being mourned in Australia and around the world following his death from a brain injury two days after being struck in the head by a bouncer.

The son of banana farmer from the northern New South Wales town of Macksville, he was dropped from the Australian Test team five times but never gave up and is being remembered for his defiant attitude in the face of adversity.

'Hughesy' or 'Hugh-dog', as he was nicknamed, was an immensely likeable and also humble, understated and hardworking team mate for the Australian, South Australian and Adelaide Strikers.

As cricketers, friends and family gathered around his bedside at St Vincent's Hospital for the 48 hours following his injury, the prayers and tributes for Hughes - as a cricketer, a mate and a great bloke - poured in.

His achievements as a young cricketer - he was due to celebrate his 26th birthday this Sunday - include making 26 first class centuries; as Western Australia coach Justin Langer pointed out this week while flying back to Sydney to see Hughes, at his age, Langer had only made one.

Hughes made a total of 15,789 runs in his first class career and many of those were ones or twos - as he laughingly recalled some years ago, he wasn't a big scorer of fours or sixes.

The left-handed opener was the son of Greg Hughes, who cleared a patch on his farm for young Phil to practise cricket, and  mother Virginia, who is of Italian origin.

Growing up with sister, Megan, and brother, Jason, as a teenager he often helped out hauling heavy bunches of bananas for the family business.

As a schoolboy, he was also a talented rugby league player who played alongside another Macksville kid, the future South Sydney Rabbitohs star Greg Inglis.

Seven years ago almost to the day, just before his 19th birthday, Hughes made his debut in first-class cricket, securing a spot in the NSW side.

As a 20-year-old, he won the the Bradman Young Player of the Year, accepting the award in Melbourne during the Allan Border Medal presentations in February 2009.

Since Hughes' stunning 2009 Test debut at the age of 20 in South Africa, he had been dropped five times, which might have defeated a less determined player.

But despite controversies over his style, technique and his off-field activities with the friends he keeps, Hughes  always plugged on, taking on the verbal bouncers along with those on the field.

He was friends with  Anthony Mundine, the controversial boxer's colourful manager, Khoder Nasser and rugby league player Sonny Bill Williams, who attended his matches.

In return the cricketer  sat ringside at Mundine's fights.

Prone to periodic run droughts due to a perceived inability to deal with the short ball, Hughes  test average was 32.65.

In 2009, after being presented with the Australian Baggy Green cap No 408, he stepped up to the crease for his first Test match, in  South Africa. In that Test series, Hughes became the youngest Australian player in cricketing history to score back-to-back centuries in his debut, which he achieved in the Durban Test, his second.

Hughes was selected to play the 2009 Ashes Test series in England, but was dropped when the English bowlers pitched short balls to him in an effort to exploit his weaknesses.

But what he may have lacked occasionally in technique, he made up for with heart and drive.

In the 2010/2011 Ashes series, selectors  ignored him except as an injury replacement for Simon Katich in the final test; he toured Sri Lanka in late 2011 and scored 126 in the third test.

But in the New Zealand tour that summer, poor performances saw him dropped and he signed a contract to play county cricket for Worcestershire in England and work on his technique.

In January 2011, Hughes was stunned to be accused of 'cheating' by English cricket legend Sir Ian Botham after being bowled a bouncer in the Sydney Test by Alastair Cook and staying on the field after what was initially thought to be a catch.

That year, Hughes decided to move away from his friends and his family in New South Wales to South Australia for the good of his game - and it paid off.

In 2012, he was the Sheffield Shield's highest run scorer and was selected for the 2012-2013 Sri Lankan tour of Australia.

He was rumoured to be up for a $1million Cricket Australia contract and in January last year he became the first Australian batsman to score a debut century  in one-day international cricket.

Last October, Hughes made his Twenty20 international cricket debut for Australia in the United Arab Emirates, in the same match as Sean Abbott made his.

Before his injury at the SCG on Tuesday, he was up for selection in next week's Test against India at the Gabba in Brisbane. 

He had played 26 Test matches and Australian selector and cricketing legend Rod Marsh described Hughes as 'a hell of a good batsman'. 

As cricketers, legends of the game and mates said after the news came on Thursday afternoon of Hughes' death: 'his time was just around the corner ... he was about to come into his own'.
