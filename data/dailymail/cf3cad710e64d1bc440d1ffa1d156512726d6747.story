Skoda has unveiled the ultimate baby buggy - an incredible one-off pram fitted with sports suspension and 20-inch alloy wheels.

Engineers at the Czech car maker thought of the most luxurious modifications they could add to a humble pram.

The result is a pushchair that has wing mirrors, high-spec brakes with brake lights, and headlights.

The high performance all terrain buggy has been described as the ultimate baby carrier 'fit for a king'

It was created by a team of Skoda engineers who were given the task of bringing car qualities to everyday objects

The 'Man-Pram' more than holds its own next to the new SKODA Octavia vRS, which it is designed to accompany

It rolls on a set of wheels which have been fitted with all terrain tyres, with extra comfort provided by the sports seat and hydraulic suspension.

The high performance all terrain buggy has 
been described as the ultimate baby carrier that is 'fit for a king'.

According to a survey of 1,000 fathers, two thirds say they would spend more time behind the wheel of a buggy if they had access to a more stylish model.

As impressive as it looks, it is probably not that practical for the average homeowner, as it is big enough to need its own garage.

Heidi Cartledge, Head of Marketing at Å koda UK said: â€˜We used it in the new Octavia vRS TV ad because we wanted to bring to life the idea of enhancing the performance of everyday objects.' 

As fun as the gigantic pram looks it is sadly not available to buy in the shops

Ordinary prams are no competition for the two-meter tall pram, which promises the ultimate in comfort for its small passenger
