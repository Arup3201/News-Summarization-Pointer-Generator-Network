It was claimed to be the most expensive house in Texas worth an estimated $20 million when it went on the market around 2008 following the divorce of media moguls Doug and Melanie Johnson.

With little interest in the 24,000 square foot house, which has eight bedrooms and 14 bathrooms, the seller was forced to cut $10 million off the price. 

Despite this, potential buyers failed to meet the asking price, so Mrs Johnson has cut the price down to $4,999,999 in a final bid to sell the property.

The 'European style house' is 24,000 square foot and was built by TV moguls Doug and Melanie Johnson in 1997 

The house was initially put on the market for $20 million but after it failed to sell, $10 million was cut from the asking price 

Despite the massive price reduction, nobody bought the luxurious property, which has marble floors and counter tops

Local media reports in Texas claim that Beyonce, who is from Houston, and several oil barons have all expressed an interest in buying the palatial house.

The massive property is located in Piney Point, a wooded area to the west of Houston.

The Johnsons divorced in 2008 and the Channel 51 TV station founded by Mr Johnson filed for bankruptcy as a result of the divorce. 

According the estate agents handling the sale the property is 'a magnificent estates in prestigious Shady Point sub-division.' 

The house is described as being 'European designed' and features 'hand painted gold leaf, vaulted ceilings, marble columns and dual spiral staircase.'

Outside the property, there is a pool, outdoor kitchen as well as 'waterfall and lush gardens'. 

It is understood that the house cost more than $16 million to build and sits on about 40,000 square foot of land.  

As well as marble, many of the surfaces in the property are made from hardwood and is fully centrally heated and air conditioned 

Among one of the main features of the property is the 1920s-style theme bar, with marble counter, hardwood floors and recessed lighting

The opulent property is in the prestigious 'Shady Point' sub-division area of west Houston in a mature wooded area 

Across the house, there are floor-to-ceiling windows allowing in plenty of light and allowing the new owner to see their gardens 

The first floor features a balcony and landing with access to the home's eight bedrooms and several of the bathrooms

Despite having eight bedrooms, the house has 14 bathrooms, many of them such as this with their own balcony offering views of the gardens

This bathroom features marble columns, marble floor and an area surrounding the bath made of marble

The property also features large rooms which seem able to host a small wedding or other type of family celebration

With the mature palm trees in the garden and luscious green grass, it does not look like your average house in Houston, Texas

The selling agent claims that the property has a 'European' design, with an Italian-style terrace overlooking the gardens 

A small river flows to the edge of the property, near the massive patio area which can be used for entertaining 

Unsurprisingly for a house which initially cost $20 million, it features its own swimming pool, which is not overlooked by any other property

According to the agents, there is also a waterfall area, games room and even a cinema on the third floor 

The garden also features two sculptures of elephants and a gazebo at the edge of the property beside a petal fence marking the boundary 

It is understood that the Johnsons' paid $16 million to build their dream home before they divorced

The 24,000 square foot house takes up more than half of the 40,000 square foot size of the entire lot
