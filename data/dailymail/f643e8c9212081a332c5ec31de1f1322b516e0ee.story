Katherine Padania, 45, made £30,000 selling fake Mulberry bags after buying them on the internet for £100 and selling them on for £150

A conwoman fleeced over £30,000 from unsuspecting customers by flogging fake designer accessories from China at 'handbag parties'.

Katherine Padania, 45, shipped in knock-off Mulberry handbags, purses and wallets after buying them online for £100 each.

The schemer then held 'handbag parties' where she claimed the bags were real and sold them at £150 each as 'factory seconds'.

But she was caught out when an unhappy customer complained to trading standards after a buckle fell off one of the brown and gold bags.

Padania was arrested after trading standards officers discovered a stash of fake goods at her home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., on October 26, 2012.

On Friday she appeared at Stafford Crown Court where she pleaded guilty to selling and possessing counterfeit goods, but walked free after being handed an eight-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months.

Sentencing, Judge Mark Eades told her: 'What you did is not a victimless crime. It is so easy to get involved in selling counterfeit goods.

'There is a real market out there for fashion items selling for a cheap price.'

The court heard Padania conned her customers out of more than £30,000 over a 12 month period.

In total, 60 Mulberry handbags, wallets and purses were seized from her home by Staffordshire County Council, which would have been worth £24,000 if they were real.

Paperwork listing transactions over a four-month period adding up to a total of £17,230 were also found.

Padania claimed to investigators that she thought the items were genuine. However the judge dismissed this, saying you would have to be 'blindfolded twice over' not to notice they were fakes.

She was rumbled after one customer complained to Trading Standards after the gold buckle on her bag fell off

Prosecuting, Richard Dewsberry said: 'She was selling the handbags to other people by hosting handbag parties.

'She told customers she could source the products much cheaper from Mulberry because they were factory over-runs or seconds.

'One customer bought several handbags in August 2011. The first bag broke relatively quickly, the buckle came off.

'The customer told Mrs Padania about this but she suggested she should take it to a local cobbler to get it fixed.

'The customer told the defendant it would be better to contact Mulberry directly, but Mrs Padania quickly put her off that idea by saying they would not be interested.

'The customer then started to use a second bag and the same thing happened.

'This time, instead of going back to Mrs Padania, she contacted Mulberry and Trading Standards.

'The items were checked and confirmed to be counterfeit.'

Padania tried to claim to investigators that she thought the bags were real, but the judge said 'you would have to be blindfolded twice' in order to think they were genuine

David Bratt, defending, said that Padania had run a professional operation, but had been 'mortified' by her actions.

After the hearing Staffordshire County Council officials said they welcomed the court proceedings.

County Councillor Mark Winnington, cabinet member for economy, said: 'Counterfeiting is a serious crime that damages the local economy and puts jobs at risk.

'It also means people are fleeced into ending up with shoddy and in some cases dangerous goods.

'This sentence demonstrates that this was not just an opportunistic sale of a few items - it was a methodically well planned set-up designed to con as many people as possible.

'We hope this sends out a strong message that counterfeit sales won’t be tolerated and that we will do all we can to protect our businesses which are harmed by this type of crime.'
