Hundreds of American dog breeds including the Chihuahua really come from Asia, according to new genetic analysis

Hundreds of American dog breeds including the Chihuahua really come from Asia, according to new genetic analysis.

Swedish researchers believe that the canines hitched a ride from Asia to the Americas with ancient humans.

Native American dogs that were once thought to be extinct, have been found to be thriving, according to the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

The arrival of Europeans in the Americas has generally been assumed to have led to the extinction of indigenous dog breeds, but a comprehensive genetic study has found that the original population of native American dogs has been almost completely preserved.

Generic analysis of hundreds of American
dog breeds including chihuahuas, sled dogs and hairless Peruvian dogs 
has revealed that their ancient roots trace back to Asia.

Peter Savolainen, a researcher in evolutionary genetics at the institute, said that 30 per cent or less of native American dog breeds DNA comes from Europe, suggesting that they traveled to the Americas with the ancient humans who established pre-Columbian civilisations.

'Our results confirm that American dogs are a remaining part of the indigenous American culture, which underscores the importance of preserving these populations,' he said.

Most researchers believe that the first American setters brought dogs with them across the Bering Strait around 10,000 years ago.

European colonisers also brought their own dog breeds to the Americas - as well as a cocktail of diseases in the 16th century.

To trace the roots of American dog breeds, Dr Savolainen's research group compared mitochondrial DNA from Asian and European dogs, ancient American archaeological samples, and American dog breeds, including Chihuahuas, Peruvian hairless dogs and Arctic sled dogs (pictured)

Dr Savolainen said: 'Many populations were wiped out and the culture disappeared with them, so there was nobody to take care of the dogs.'

Many scientists consequently thought that most American dog breeds shared most of their DNA with European breeds.

To trace the roots of American dog breeds, Dr Savolainen's research group, in cooperation with colleagues in Portugal, compared DNA from Asian and European dogs, ancient American archaeological samples, and American dog breeds, including Chihuahuas, Peruvian hairless dogs and Arctic sled dogs.

They collected cheek swabs from 347 kennel club pure breeds from the Americas, including Chihuahuas, Peruvian hairless dog and Alaskan malamutes and then compared their DNA with 1,872 sampled from dogs in Asia and Europe.

The research, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that most of the American dogs had ancestry that can be traced to Asia.

'It was especially exciting to find that the Mexican breed, Chihuahua, shared a DNA type uniquely with Mexican pre-Columbian samples,' he said.

'This gives conclusive evidence for the Mexican ancestry of the Chihuahua.'

The team also tested 19 stray dogs from the Carolinas and South America.

Dr Savolainen believes that the data also suggests that the stray dogs carry genetic markers from Asia, not Europe.

'Most people thought they were just runaway European dogs,' Dr Savolainen told LiveScience.

The findings support prior studies which found that Greenland Inuit dogs didn't have much European DNA.
