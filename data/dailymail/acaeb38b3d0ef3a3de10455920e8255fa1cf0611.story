As soon as Jose Mourinho declared Chelsea's Capital One Cup final against Tottenham as the most important final of his distinguished managerial career, it was hard to see past The Special One's side.

And that could, in part, be down to the Chelsea manager's brilliant record in cup finals: he's lost just one final across 11 full seasons as a coach, winning 10 along the way plus seven league titles and four Community Shields or Super Cups.

That makes it 21 trophies across 727 games,  an average of a winner's medal every 35 matches.

'Finals are not for playing, they are for winning,' Mourinho said at full-time at Wembley, and he certainly believes in his own words given the impressive record he holds on show-piece occasions like Sunday.

Victory over Spurs ended a two-year mini-drought for Mourinho, having come through a difficult final season at Real Madrid before failing in all three cup competitions and finishing third in the Barclays Premier League with Chelsea last season.

That was his longest stretch without a trophy while in constant employment as a manager - and Sunday marked his first cup final success in almost four years.

The only final that a Mourinho-led team has been beaten in came in 2013's Copa de Rey final when Real Madrid were defeated 2-1 by local rivals Atletico Madrid - and even then it took extra time to kill off Mourinho.

Prior to that though, he had won all nine of his previous finals, picking up the Taca de Portugal, UEFA Cup and Champions League with Porto, two Carling Cups and an FA Cup in his first spell at Chelsea, a Coppa Italia and Champions League with Inter Milan and a Copa del Rey with Real. 

The stats show Chelsea's master motivator knows how to gee up his players for the big occasion: you don't have such a strong record without that ability.

'For me, it's important to feel that I'm a kid,' Mourinho said after the game at Wembley.

'And before the game, I had the same feelings as my first Final however many years ago. 

'It's important to feel the same happiness after the victory, and to feel like a kid at 52 years old.

'It's difficult for me to live without titles. I need to feed myself with titles. This is important for me and the boys.

'I went in a different direction, with two seasons without a trophy, and it looked like I was 20 years without a trophy.

'This is a good problem, to have that feeling that two years is a long time. That's a good feeling.' 

With The Special One giving his players just 20 minutes to celebrate before thoughts were focused back on their Premier League title charge, Mourinho will hope to add a couple more trophies in the 13 games (or as many as 18 if they reach the Champions League final) before the end of the season.

And now that he's managed to give his new squad the big game pedigree that they needed, few would back against the Portuguese coach to add to his rich honours list.
