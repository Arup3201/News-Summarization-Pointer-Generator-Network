A heartbroken mother gave birth just five hours after the funeral of her baby's father.

Grieving Kelly Jones, 26, went into labour at the graveside of her fianc√© killed in a car crash just days earlier.

Miss Jones was eight months pregnant when her childhood sweetheart Ricky Norman, 27, died in the country road accident.

She was determined to go to his funeral - but her midwife insisted on being at her side.

Miss Jones managed to get through the service but strong labour pains began as she knelt to lay roses on Mr Norman's grave.

She was rushed to hospital from the cemetery - and gave birth to baby Ava five hours later.

Miss Jones said: 'It was a tragic day - we said goodbye to Ricky on the same day that Ava said hello to the world.

'Giving birth should have been one of the happiest days of our lives together and Ricky would have been at my side.

'My family and friends are saying Ava is Ricky's parting gift to me and that's the way I will always think of her.'

One in a million: Ricky Norman was on his way to work when his car was in a head-on crash with a lorry on an icy mountain road

Mr Norman, a railway maintenance engineer, was on his way to work when his car was in a head-on crash with a lorry on an icy mountain road.

He had chosen his unborn baby girl's name just the day before - Ava Rikki Leigh Norman-Jones.

Miss Jones said: 'When I heard the news I was crying all day - it didn't feel real to me.

'I felt like I was dreaming and all I wanted to do was wake up from a nightmare.

'If it wasn't for me expecting Ava, I don't think I would have been able to cope.'

Healthy Ava arrived three weeks early at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, just a mile from the cemetery where her father was buried that day.

Holding baby Ava close, Miss Jones said: 'It's as if it was meant to be, as if he wanted to see her there that day.

'Ricky would have loved Ava so much. I can't believe he is gone.

'He was a one-in-a-million, everything a woman would want in a man. He was kind, caring and changed my life forever.'

The family will now never forget February 22 - the day Mr Norman was buried and his daughter was born.

Miss Jones, of Merthyr Tydfil, said: 'I don't know how I will feel on her birthday - part of me will be celebrating for Ava, but part of me will be grieving for Ricky.'

The couple have another son, one-year-old Jackson, and were planning to marry next year.

Mr Norman's mother Sylvia Norman, 47, also told how her world has been 'turned upside down' following the loss of her son.

She said: 'I cannot explain it myself. I had just laid my son to rest and hours later his daughter was born.

'It will never be the same without our son. We loved him dearly, he was our life.

'The children are the only thing keeping me going. We've got to be there for Ava. That's what Ricky would've wanted.

'He knew how hard it was going to be for us. That's why Ava was born on that day. It was his present to us.'

Police are still investigating the crash in which Mr Norman and work colleague Robert McGovern, 35, were killed at Storey Arms in the Brecon Beacons.
