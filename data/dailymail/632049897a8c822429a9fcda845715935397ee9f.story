Mario Balotelli may not have shone during the World Cup, but he's clearly raring to go for the new season.

The Italy striker uploaded a series of pictures to his Instagram account of himself working out with his trademark rippling torso put to work.

He even found time for a spot of golf while visiting his sponsors Puma - although he hasn't found quite the right ball.

His girlfriend Fanny Neguesha accompanied him as the couple left with bags of goodies, and fans might be interested to see the display behind the duo, resplendent in Arsenal badges.

The AC Milan forward will link up with his club for pre-season but has been linked with a move to Arsene Wenger's side.

AC Milan's owner Silvio Berlusconi claimed the 23-year-old's poor performance at the World Cup cost him a potential move back to the Premier League this picture may give Arsenal fans hope.
