After the second strong earthquake in as many weeks, seismologists have warned that Friday's 5.1 tremor that rumbled through Los Angeles could herald a much larger quake.

The series of earthquakes began at 8.03pm, peaking at 9.09pm with a tremor centered near Brea in Orange County causing Disneyland to close, gas leaks, water main breaks and a rockslide near the epicenter, according to authorities as up to 100 aftershocks were felt.

US Geological Survey seismologist Lucy Jones said that, 'There could be an even larger earthquake in the next few hours or the next few days,' as more than two dozen aftershocks ranging from magnitudes 2 to 3.6 were recorded, according to the USGS.

And on Saturday afternoon, a shallow magnitude 4.1 earthquake was reported hitting Rowland Heights.

This quake was centered not far from Friday's epicenter in La Habra and out of the hundreds of aftershocks this would have been the largest.

The 4.4 quake was felt across a large area of Southern California. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.

'Tonight's earthquake is the second in two weeks, and reminds us to be prepared,' Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a written statement released about an hour after the shaking stopped.

Geologists at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the quake was shallow, at a depth of only 1.2 miles.

'We have to analyze that to make sure of the exact depth but it is relatively shallow,' said Robert Graves of CalTech. 'Earthquakes in California tend to be deeper than that so it's a little bit anomalous.'

Graves said that there was a five percent chance that the quake was a precursor to a stronger quake.

On March 17, a 4.4 magnitude earthquake struck the Los Angeles basin and was centered 15 miles west-northwest of the downtown civic center, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The reported damage was slight according to authorities.

At the time, Lucy Jones said, 'It's not that large by California terms. It's the size of earthquake we have across the state once every couple of months. But we haven't had one like this in LA for quite a while.'

Experts said that the earthquakes occurred on the Puente Hills thrust fault, which stretches from  the San Gabriel Valley to downtown Los Angeles.

Last night's quake was shallow, which 'means the shaking is very concentrated in a small area,' said Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson.

Hauksson revealed that the earthquake was unusual because the 5.1 quake was preceded by the weaker foreshock.

Scientists such as Hauksson are very concerned about the Puente Hills fault because it runs directly under downtown Los Angeles.

'This is the fault that could eat L.A.,' seismologist Sue Hough told The LA Times in 2003.

Residents across Los Angeles reported swinging chandeliers, fireplaces dislodging from walls and burglar alarms being set off by the quake.

Eyewitness photos and videos show bottles and packages strewn on store floors. Southern California Edison reported power outages to about 2,000 customers following the quake.

More than two dozen aftershocks ranging from magnitudes 2 to 3.6 were recorded, according to the USGS. Earlier in the evening, two foreshocks registering at magnitude-3.6 and magnitude-2.1 hit nearby in the city of La Habra.

Public safety officials said crews were inspecting bridges, dams, rail tracks and other infrastructure systems for signs of damage. The Brea police department said the rock slide in the Carbon Canyon area caused a car to overturn, and the people inside the car sustained minor injuries.

Callers to KNX-AM reported seeing a brick wall collapse, water sloshing in a swimming pool and wires and trees swaying back and forth. One caller said he was in a movie theater lobby in Brea when the quake struck.

'A lot of the glass in the place shook like crazy,' he said. 'It started like a roll and then it started shaking like crazy. Everybody ran outside, hugging each other in the streets.'

Fullerton resident Daniel Taylor told the station everything fell down in his home.

'My 100-gallon fish tank went down. Water damage everywhere from the tank. My water pipes under my sink cracked,' he said.

One viewer in Walnut said the power went out for 10 minutes.

'The whole room was shaking. My bed was rolling for longer than most I've felt,' said another

'A little tremor here in the ballpark. I'm not sure if the folks felt it, but we certainly felt it here in press box row,' Scully said. 'A tremor and only that, thank goodness.'

Tom Connolly, a Boeing employee who lives in La Mirada, the next town over from La Habra, said the magnitude-5.1 quake lasted about 30 seconds.

'We felt a really good jolt. It was a long rumble and it just didn't feel like it would end,' he told The Associated Press by phone. 'Right in the beginning it shook really hard, so it was a little unnerving. People got quiet and started bracing themselves by holding on to each other. It was a little scary.'

Friday's quake hit a week after a pre-dawn magnitude-4.4 quake centered in the San Fernando Valley rattled a swath of Southern California. That jolt shook buildings and rattled nerves, but did not cause significant damage.

Southern California has not experienced a devastating earthquake since the 1994 magnitude-6.7 Northridge quake killed several dozen people and caused $25 billion in damage.

Preliminary data suggest Friday night's 5.1 magnitude earthquake occurred near the Puente Hills thrust fault, which stretches from the San Gabriel Valley to downtown Los Angeles and caused the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, USGS seismologist Lucy Jones said.

'It's a place where we've had a lot of earthquakes in the past,' she said.

The 5.9 Whittier Narrows quake killed eight people and caused $360 million in damage.
