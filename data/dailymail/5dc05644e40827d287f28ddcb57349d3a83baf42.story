The former boss of a mental health charity and his wife who stole over £200,000 from vulnerable disabled clients have been jailed for a total of six years.

Peter Childs, 61, and his wife Alison, 48, worked for Lincoln and District Mencap but took disability living allowance benefits being paid to people who they were being paid to protect.

A court heard Mr Childs even set up a £1,000-a-month ‘ghost’ contract for his 27-year-old Lithuanian mistress and showered her with expensive gifts.

He financed the extravagant lifestyle by plundering the bank accounts of Lincoln and District Mencap and the clients he was supposed to care for.

The charity is operated independently of the national Royal Mencap organisation.

Mr Childs, who was the chairman, and Alison, who worked as accommodation manager, swindled more than £200,000 during their cruel six year scam.

They also pocketed cold weather payments and overcharged disabled clients for overcharged for utility bills by exploiting their victims’ vulnerabilities.

Last month the couple were convicted by a jury of 12 charges of theft and 14 charges of fraud by abuse of position between December 2005 and December 2011.

On Tuesday at Lincoln Crown Court they were both jailed for three years.

Sentencing Judge Sean Morris said the pair had taken advantage of some of society’s most vulnerable people.

He said: 'You were entrusted to look after the interests of some of Lincoln’s most vulnerable and trusting adults.

'Neither of you had the guts or plain decency to admit from the outset everything you had done.

'You set about, over a long period, concocting a defence that culminated in a trial lasting weeks, costing the state a fortune and the calling of vulnerable people to give evidence.

'It culminated in both of you going into the witness box and telling lie after lie after lie.'

Lincoln Crown Court heard that Childs bought his mistress Inga Stasytyte (pictured) a range of expensive gifts including a £5,000 Land Rover

During their five-week trial a jury was told Mr Childs - who arrived at court in a wheelchair - also put his Lithuanian mistress Inga Stasytyte on the payroll even though she never worked for the charity.

The court heard he bought her a £5,000 Land Rover and other romantic gifts and flowers.

Ms Stasytyte came to Britain in 2006 and met the Childs while working at a holiday park in Norfolk.

She moved into their luxurious farmhouse, initially as a housekeeper.

He went on to father a boy with her but the relationship ended after Miss Stasytyte returned from a visit to Lithuania to find that Alison Childs had moved back in.

Giving evidence she said: 'He bought me a car, a Land Rover. It cost about £5,000. He bought me flowers and stuff. I was paid monthly.'

Ms Stasytyte returned to Lithuania as Childs prepared to divorce his wife but when she returned he suffered a stroke and was living with his wife again.

Ms Stasytyte added: 'I realised then all our relationship was based on lies.'

The trial also heard the couple, from Nettleham, Lincs., defrauded Lincolnshire County Council by inflating employee numbers and staff working hours in order to obtain extra grant funding.

Two Lincoln and District Mencap clients Roger and Richard Fogg, 57, were said to have paid a total of £28,000 for gas, electricity and water bills over the course of six years when their actual bills were only £7,400.

Prosecutor Stephen Lowne said the crimes came to light after Peter Childs suffered a stroke and his wife took time off work to look after him.

He said: 'These two defendants held a considerable position of trust.

'They had the responsibility of looking after people with varying degrees of mental difficulties.

'These are people who did not have the ability to understand what was happening.'

Mr Childs, who also ran a private security firm, claimed he was legally entitled to the money as he was paid an honorarium by the charity.

Mrs Childs claimed she left financial matters to her husband and was not involved in either fraud or theft.

The charity operated independently of the national Royal Mencap organisation to which it was affiliated.
