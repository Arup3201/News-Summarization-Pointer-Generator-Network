Tony Blair has agreed to advise the next government of Albania in a deal which could be worth millions of pounds.

Albania is hoping to join the European Union and is understood to be interested in New Labour-style reforms.

Mr Blair is being lined up to work as a consultant for the Socialist Party if, as expected, it wins next month’s elections.

Party leader Edi Rama wrote on Twitter this week: ‘An excellent meeting with Tony Blair. We agreed that after June 23, he and his team will work with us for good governance. Fantastic!’

In a video released of the meeting, Mr Blair said: ‘I will be very happy to help you. I am very interested in your country.’

The former prime minister is considered a hero in Albania.

He was involved in the 1999 Nato action in Kosovo, when Serb forces attacked ethnic Albanians. Many children were named ‘Tonibler’ in his honour.

The country, ruled by hardline Communists until the 1990s, became a democracy in 1998. It is one of Europe’s poorest countries, with its GDP 119th in the world – below war-torn Congo.

A party spokesman would not say how much Mr Blair would be paid, but called him ‘a very important partner’.

Mr Blair has also signed deals to advise governments in Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Brazil and Colombia with the Government Advisory Practice, set up after he left Downing Street in 2007.

He was criticised after it emerged 
earlier this year that he will advise president Nursultan Nazarbayev of 
Kazakhstan, whose police force shot and killed 15 striking oil workers 
in December 2011.

The deal with Kazakhstan was said to be worth £16million.

The Government Advisory Practice is managed by another of Mr Blair’s companies, Windrush Ventures. Its accounts reveal profits of £3.6million in the year ending March 2012.

A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘Mr Rama met Tony Blair in London last week. Mr Rama said that if he became prime minister, he would like Mr Blair’s advice on how to modernise.

‘Mr Blair said he would be happy to help. . . But no formal agreement was made.’
