A toddler who captured the hearts of the nation when she sparked a worldwide marrow donor appeal as she battled a rare form of cancer died 'peacefully' this morning.

Margot Martini was just 14-months-old when she was diagnosed with both Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) in October last year.

Her parents Vicki, 39, and Yaser, 43, launched a Swab4Margot campaign on Christmas Eve which was backed by celebrities including Stephen Fry and Gary Barlow.

The appeal went viral across the world and led to 50,000 people requesting swab kits from the charity Delete Blood Cancer UK in the first six weeks.

A match was then discovered and Margot underwent a successful bone marrow transplant from an anonymous  22-year-old German man in February this year.

Doctors declared the child was 99 per cent certain to be disease free a month later but tragically, tests in June revealed a small amount of ALL had returned.

Her parents then made the heart-breaking decision to stop her treatment in July after doctors told them her chances of being able to live a normal life were slim.

And this morning, Vicki and Yaser revealed the two-year-old had passed away 'surrounded by those who love her' at their home in Roehampton, London.

Writing on their website, which they have used to keep supporters updated throughout the treatment, Margot's parents said: 'At 10:24 this morning, our dear little daughter, Margot passed away at home.

'She died peacefully and was surrounded by those who love her.

'Thank you for all your love and support.

'Vicki, Yaser, Oscar & Rufus.'

Last Sunday, the parents – originally from Essington, Staffs – posted a statement saying the family were taking things 'hour by hour'.

They said: 'Margot's condition has deteriorated significantly over the past couple of days and in particular since yesterday afternoon, she's now in a very poor and fragile state.

'It's an extremely difficult time for Margot and for all the family.

'The only thing we can now do is continue to monitor her constantly changing condition and try and keep her comfortable.

'Margot has been asleep all day and she continues to sleep peacefully. Mercifully, for now at least the drugs appear to be working.'

Her parents also revealed nothing more could be done to save the toddler and said she was 'beyond rescue' earlier this month.

In a post on the Team Margot website on October 16, dad Yaser, a real estate investor, said: 'Bottom line is this life threatening pseudomonas bug is gathering momentum and Margot can't seem to clear it.

'We are told that Margot is now beyond rescue and that it's no longer a matter of the place of care, but the place of death.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is an acute form of leukaemia, or cancer of the white blood cells, characterised by the overproduction of cancerous, immature white blood cells.

These cause damage and death by inhibiting the production of normal cells. ALL is most common in childhood with a peak incidence at 2–5 years of age, and another peak in old age,

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a cancer characterised by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. AML is the most common acute leukaemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with age.

'Margot is to remain at home, where we are keeping her as comfortable as possible.'

Brave Margot captured the hearts of the nation with her curly ginger hair and infectious smile throughout her treatment.

Celebrities including Stephen Hawking, Omid Djalili, Catherine Tate, Boris Becker and Bill Bryson all gave their support to the Swab4Margot campaign.

A special video was also recorded by her favourite TV character Peppa Pig – voiced by 12-year-old Harley Bird – which ended with the touching words 'Goodnight Margot, sleep tight.'

Hundreds of tributes began flooding in to the Team Margot page on Facebook just minutes after her tragic death was announced.

Sarah Cody wrote: 'Heartbreaking but I'm glad her suffering wasn't prolonged. Sleep tight beautiful girl xxxx'

Gill McCullen added: 'I've never cried so much for a little girl I never knew. Devastated for you all, she was loved by so many in the end. Love to you all xxx'

And Janine Broughton said: 'Margot's legacy will be the many other children that will be helped through all your campaigning.

'So very sad to hear your heartbreaking news.You couldn't have done more and she knew she was so loved by you and Team Margot. Love to you and the family xxxx'

Margot battled against an extremely rare form of dual lineage Leukaemia - exhibiting both Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.

At the start of her fight, her parents revealed a consultant haematologist told them he had only seen three similar cases in the last 10 years.

The brave toddler inspired hundreds to become lifesaving bone marrow donors as part of the 'Just One More' awareness campaign in support of Delete Blood Cancer and Anthony Nolan.

As a result of Team Margot's efforts, more than 35,000 people joined the stem cell register in the UK - meaning statistically there will be more than 500 blood cancer patients who will now get the option of a donor who could save their life
