When striker Graziano Pelle arrived on British scenes hardly anyone had heard of him.

Even disgruntled Southampton fans, who over the summer had seen their beloved club become a cash and carry with five key first-team players being snapped up by Premier League rivals, raised an eyebrow when the Italian put pen to paper on a three-year deal at St Mary's.

And who could blame them? Even if Southampton had somehow signed Cristiano Ronaldo they would still struggle to stay in the Premier League with a squad resembling an arid plain, they thought.

Pelle has not allowed this to happen with the Italian part of a revamped Southampton side who are forcing pundits and fans around the world over to eat their words.

Since joining the Saints from Dutch side Feyenoord in July for £8.8million, the Italian has scored nine goals in 12 appearances for Ronald Koeman's side.

The striker just can't stop scoring with  two goals against Stoke in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night sealing Southampton's passage to the quarter-finals.

If the 29-year-old heads in the same direction, then there is no reason why Pelle won't be remembered as the best Italian to have  played in the Premier League.

One thing is for sure, fellow countryman Mario Balotelli won't be pleased with the headlines that Pelle is receiving, with the striker having already replaced him in the national team.

Here, Sportsmail  look at other Italians who produced the good and bad in the Premier League.

The Good

Gianluca Vialli

Having spent 16 years in Italy, Gianluca Vialli joined Chelsea from Juventus at the creaking age of 32. During his three year spell at the club, the Italian scored 27 goals in 70 appearances for the West-London outfit. He later went on to become the Blues player-manager after Ruud Gullit was sacked in February 1998.

Fabrizio Ravanelli

A man who oozed class, Fabrizio Ravanelli like Vialli arrived on British shores from Juventus in 1996. 

The 'White Feather' will be best remembered for the 1996-97 Premier League season where he donned the shirt of Middlesbrough. Even though his complaints about the city and the club's training complex could fill a book bigger than War and Peace, he was adored by Boro fans. 

Not surprising when he scored 16 goals in 34 appearances for the club.

Benito Carbone

Make that a hat-trick! Striker Benito Carbone also joined the British footballing scene in 1996 when he signed for Sheffield Wednesday from Inter Milan. However, there is a reason why he swapped cosmopolitan Milan for the cold and wet side-streets of Sheffield. 

Carbone also had disappointing spells at Aston Villa, Bradford, and Middlesbrough.

Paolo Di Canio

A cult figure at both West Ham and Sheffield Wednesday. Paolo Di Canio won plaudits for his fair-play, crazy goal-celebrations and mouth-watering volleys which often left opposing goalkeepers for dead. 

The Italian later attracted negativity over his self-proclaimed allegiance to fascism.

Gianfranco Zola

Gianfranco Zola will always be remembered for his time in England for his massive smile and his ability to score a shed-load of goal for Chelsea, with most of those being important ones too. 

He ended his seven-year spell at the Blues by scoring a mesmerising lob at home against Everton in 2003.

The Bad

Mario Balotelli

Why always him? Mario Balotelli keeps on making the headlines for all the wrong reasons. 

First he picks a fight with former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini during his time at the Etihad, then the Italian builds a race-track in his back garden. 

Now at Liverpool, he's yet to score a Premier League goal since making his £16m move.

Massimo Maccarone

Massimo Maccarone arrived in Middlesbrough from Italian outfit Empoli in 2002 for an eyebrow-raising fee of about £8.2m. 

During his five-year stay in the Premier League he was only able to score 18 goals. 

At the end of their four-year ordeal, Middlesbrough were fortunate not to have to pay Siena to take Maccarone of their hands.

Corrado Grabbi

The name of Corrado Grabbi will always have a place in the worst-line up in the history of the Premier League. 

During his three-year spell at Blackburn, the Italian only managed to find the net twice. Football fans round the world will also be scratching their heads when they realise that he was once on the books of Juventus.

Andrea Silenzi

In Andrea Silenzi's 17-year career as a footballer, he played for two teams without scoring a single goal. One is Italian side Reggiana, and the other is Nottingham Forest. 

What an example from the first Italian to feature in the Premier League.

Rolando Bianchi

The only mesmerising thing about Rolando Bianchi during his one-year spell with Manchester City between 2007-2008 was his name.

Commentators were only able to shout it four times though, with the Italian quickly leaving the scene for Torino a year later. 

The only thing that he can boast about is that Robinho was brought in as his replacement.
