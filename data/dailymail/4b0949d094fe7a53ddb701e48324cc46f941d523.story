West Ham showed their support for the newly set-up Dylan Tombides foundation ahead of kick-off against Crystal Palace with players and club staff wearing shirts and scarves honouring the memory of their former academy product.

Tombides, the West Ham player who lost his battle with cancer last year, now has a foundation bearing his initials and squad number and players from both teams sported shirts featuring 'DT38' during the warm-ups at Villa Park.

Manager Sam Allardyce and co-owner David Gold also wore foundation scarves during their pre-match preparations ahead of the lunchtime kick-off.

Tombides, 20, died last April after being diagnosed with cancer three years previously.

Tributes to Tombides poured in, with the DT38 Foundation structured to raise awareness and provide support for those suffering with testicular cancer. Fans also planned a minute's applause 38 minutes into the Barclays Premier League clash.

'On April 18, 2014, Dylan's organs failed and we said goodbye to our beloved son and brother,' the striker's mum, Tracylee, said.

'If we had known about testicular cancer and what we needed to do to catch it early, we would have insisted on an ultra sound when we went to the GP. It breaks our heart to think that this could have been prevented.

'Dylan was robbed of a future that he dreamed of as a young boy. It robbed Taylor of a brother and it robbed my husband and I of watching our beautiful son grow and fulfil his dreams.

'Please do not let this happen to your son, brother, friend or father. If you have a concern with your testicles please see a doctor straight away and insist on an ultrasound – it may just save your life.'
