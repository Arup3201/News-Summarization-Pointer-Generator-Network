'David complained of pain in his right thigh and was treated by the physiotherapist, he told Goal.com.

'The most important thing now is to see how he will feel today [Monday] and tomorrow [Tuesday]. If the game is now, he could not play, but we still have time.'

The South Americans go into this fixture boasting a superior record against their opponents - having won having won eight of the 10 previous meetings between the sides.

Despite the blow of losing Kagawa, Japan coach Javier Aguirre is confident his side can cause problems against Brazil.

'I'm as relaxed as I always am,' he is quoted as saying by Kyodo News. 'The result did not reflect our performance.

'I think we had four clear-cut chances we didn't take. I'm pleased with the way the team clicked, but I'm not satisfied with the result.

'If we play the way we did [against Jamaica] we might have a chance against Brazil.

'We had 20 shots against Jamaica. Against Brazil we might have one - and we'll need to take that.'
