Mayweather, who remains unbeaten, defeated Maidana in a bout at the MGM Grand Hotel back in May.Boxing rival Manny Pacquiao announced that he will quit the ring in 2016 which has sparked rumours that Floyd Mayweather could finally go for the fight boxing has been waiting an eternity to see.

Mayweather’s $200 million-plus, six-fight contract with the Showtime cable TV network is due to expire in September 2015, by which time Pacquiao had originally planned to hang up the gloves, so there is now the perfect gap to arrange the glamour tie.

If the pair were to arrange the fight then they could be set to share a staggering $300 million which would be by far the richest fight in boxing history.

Mayweather certainly isn’t short of cash. The American frequently parades his latest purchases which include Bugati supercars and extravagant Audemars Piguet (AP) watches.
