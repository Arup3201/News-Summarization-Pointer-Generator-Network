Crime scene: Kentucky State Police say they still do not know the motive behind the murders of the Champion family on Sunday morning

Kentucky State Police and sheriff's deputies in the small town are now trying to piece together what happened on the Champion's farm before they were gunned down on Sunday night. 

Ryan Champion, the lone survivor, told WSMV-TV that his family's relationship with Riservato was 'very short.' He says he was home when Riservato killed his parents and sisters.  

'I was able to turn the tables on him. He got close enough to me that I could turn the tables, and that was it,' Mr Champion said. 

'Every minute the entire thing was going on, that's all I was waiting for. I was waiting for an opportunity.'

Mr Champion said he was spared because the killer did not see him as a threat. He declined to elaborate further on the killings, citing the ongoing police investigation. 

Police have said they consider Ryan Champion a witness and a victim and will not comment further on his involvement.  

The Champion family was attacked after returning home from the Cadiz Church of Christ, where Lindsey Champion is an elder.

Kentucky State Police troopers spent all of Sunday combing through the house and collecting evidence in the murders of the Champion family

 

Kentucky State Police received a call about a shooting at 11.44am and arrived on the scene to find the bodies in and around the family home.

Detectives are looking into the relationship between the Champion family and Riservato, who lived about 20 miles away in Hopkinsville.

State Police Trooper Jay Thomas said the suspect had only briefly met the Champions last week. Detectives are still trying to determine a motive in the murders. 

Ristervato's ex-girlfriend took to Facebook to say that he could never have committed the murders. 

'Anyone who knew Vito knows he's not a killer. He was a loving father and a good friend. I don't want his name to be tarnished just because someone can't own up to what they have done, its so sad how someone has to pin it on someone who is no longer with us,' Bekah Kuser said.  

Cadiz, Kentucky, is a town of less than 2,500 about 40miles outside Clarksville, Tennessee
