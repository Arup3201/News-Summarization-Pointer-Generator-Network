Hundreds of Libyans invited to the UK for military training are being sent home amid claims of rape, drunkenness, fighting and theft.

The cadets – hand-picked by the British Army – were supposed to be given leadership skills to help their war-torn country.

Instead they have been allowed to run amok outside their Cambridgeshire barracks, terrifying their neighbours. British troops have been drafted in to restore order.

Worse still, Libya has failed to pay the bill for the programme. Since the training course – which is backed by David Cameron – began in June:

Ali Zidan, Libya’s former prime minister, paid £2.5million to the UK government but has claimed further payments were being blocked by Libya’s Islamist-led congress.

In April, Mr Cameron wrote to Mr Zidan’s successor, Abdullah al-Thinni, urging him to make the payments.

Upset: Local MP Andrew Lansley has said that the MoD has no other option but to ban any more visits 

The Prime Minister pledged the UK’s continuing support but added: ‘I understand that you have been working personally to take forward the General Purpose Force Programme and that plans are now advanced for some 360 recruits to come to the UK in May.

‘I hope that it will be possible to resolve quickly the remaining issues relating to contract and payment, given the overall importance of this programme to our shared goal of improving stability and security.’

The call for extra troops to restore order came from police last week. Units of the 2 Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers, were sent in to Bassingbourn Barracks, near Royston, after their leave was cancelled.

Last night, the Ministry of Defence announced the 24-week course was ending early and the 325 cadets would be sent home.

The future of the entire programme – scheduled to cover 2,000 trainees – is in doubt amid protests from furious locals.

Andrew Lansley, a former Tory health secretary who had initially supported the scheme, said: ‘As this stands, no further groups of trainees could be brought here from Libya.’

He said the MoD must be held accountable for ‘a serious failure’. Mr Lansley said about 10 per cent of the cadets ‘were not accepting the discipline and weren’t accepting what they were asked to do and were not becoming part of a military force’.

‘They were looking to take whatever advantage they could,’ he added. ‘It has meant recently that there has been a lot of additional resources by the MoD to try and shore it up and give protection. It is all very disappointing. We wanted it to work and for it to make a contribution in Libya. I am unhappy.’

The demand for answers came after Cambridge magistrates were told how three of the cadets had behaved ‘like a pack’ as they hunted down and sexually assaulted three women in one night.

Ibrahim Naji El Maarfi, 20, and Mohammed Abdalsalam, 27, left their barracks on stolen bicycles and cycled to Cambridge where they stalked their victims under the cover of darkness. The city’s magistrates were told how they touched them sexually and attempted to put their hands up their skirts.

Abdalsalam admitted two counts of sexual assault, one count of threatening behaviour towards a police office and one count of theft. El Maarfi pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault, one count of exposure and one count of theft.

A third man, Khaled El Azibi, 18, who was charged with three counts of sexual assault and one count of theft, refused to enter pleas at the hearing.

They will be sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court at a later date.

 

Cases: Five Libyan men have appeared in court in the past week over alleged sex attacks in Cambridge

In another incident, Moktar Ali Saad Mahmoud, 33, and Ibrahim Abogutila, 22, have been charged with the rape of a man in a Cambridge park.

An estimated £2.5million was spent refurbishing Bassingbourn to host the series of courses conducted by members of 3 Scots, the Black Watch.

Peter Robinson, who chairs the parish council, said: ‘I thought Muslims didn’t drink but there has been a run on vodka in the local shop. That’s their favourite trip – going to the Spar and then stealing bicycles.’

Downing Street confirmed that the Libyan soldiers are eligible to seek asylum in the UK before they are kicked out.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘Asylum rules apply to everyone. It will be the existing asylum rules that apply.’
