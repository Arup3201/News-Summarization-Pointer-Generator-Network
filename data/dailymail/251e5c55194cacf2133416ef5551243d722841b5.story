With the military uniforms and apparently smoke-filled streets, these pictures look like they could come straight from a war zone.

But in fact they depict a bizarre annual tradition in a Spanish village which sees revellers taking control of the community and fighting a mock battle to impose their surreal regime.

Citizens of Ibi, in the province of Alicante, took to the streets today with flour, eggs and firecrackers in what must surely be one of the biggest food fights in the world.

Fight: Two revellers taking part in the 'Els Enfarinats' festival in Ibi in south-east Spain

Clash: The day is a fight between a group of married men and their rivals seeking to stop them taking over

Weapons: A member of 'La Oposicio' reviews his armoury in preparation for a counter-attack

Let rip: Two men clash with the help of a whole box of eggs sent flying through the air

The origins of the tradition are unclear - it is said to be over two centuries old, but in its current form it has been running only since 1981.

The festival of 'Els Enfarinats' is held every year on December 28, the Day of the Innocents which is similar to April Fool's Day in Spanish culture.

It consists of two main groups who clash outside the town hall and cover the area in messy substances such as eggs and flour.

Aftermath: Two participants covered in their warpaint and a hefty coating of flour following the festivities

Captive: One side drags away a prisoner during a heading moment in the good-natured mock battle

Eye of the storm: A man takes a moment to relax as battle rages all around him

Cackles: The 'Els Enfarinats' group impose surreal new laws on the small town in Alicante

One group is the 'Els Enfarinats', married men who assert control of the town and impose absurd laws on the citizens, fining anyone who disobeys them.

In opposition is 'La Oposicio', a group which represents the forces of law and order and attempts to defeat the new regime.

Emerging from the mist: The flurries of flour look almost like smoke curling across a battlefield

Going with a bang: The streets are filled with dangerous firecrackers as well as the food

No mercy: Participants clearly take the tradition, claimed to be over 200 years old, very seriously indeed

Throughout the course of the day, the town became increasingly chaotic as food and fireworks flew through the air and coated the streets.

But at 5pm, normal order is restored as the community gathers together for a celebratory dance.

The fines collected by the men throughout the day are donated to local charities.

Missile: The competitors dress up in military gear during the annual rampage outside the town hall

Spectacle: Hundreds were gathered in Ibi on Friday to watch the madcap antics
