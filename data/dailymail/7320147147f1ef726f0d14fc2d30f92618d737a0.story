Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco are prepared to take Petr Cech on loan for a year, in a deal which will appeal to Chelsea if they can secure the right to recall him.

Cech is facing the prospect of a year on the sidelines after Jose Mourinho selected Thibaut Courtois for the opening game of the season at Burnley.

Mourinho, who is also exploring the idea of swapping Fernando Torres with 23-year-old Roma striker Mattia Destro, would prefer to keep both goalkeepers at the club but accepts Cech’s desire to play regularly.

Off? Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco are prepared to take Petr Cech on loan for a year from Chelsea

Dropped: Cech was replaced by Thibaut Courtois in goal for Chelsea against Burnley on Monday

Chelsea are in a position where they must cut one foreign player from their Premier League squad and two from their Champions League squad before the transfer window closes on September 1.

Cech is an obvious candidate to leave, although Mourinho is concerned in case Courtois suffers any problems with fitness or form as he adjusts to the English game.

There were no adjustment issues at Turf Moor though and Courtois has played consistently well on loan at Atletico Madrid.

Back-up keeper Mark Schwarzer will be 42 in October and Mourinho will have doubts that he can play for an extended run as Chelsea challenge on four fronts, should it be necessary.

The loan with a recall option would deliver Chelsea some peace of mind, although any recall would only be possible in January.

The deal for Destro and Torres is less straightforward as it requires an agreement over Torres’ wages.

Happy with both: Jose Mourinho insists he wants both to stay but must cut a foreign player from his squad
