If the prisoner was trying  to wind up the police officer  who was driving him to a  custody cell 50 miles away,  he succeeded – spectacularly.

For after being repeatedly asked how fast the high-performance police car would go, PC Barry Evans put his foot down – and drove at speeds of up to 140mph.

But when he delivered the suspect to their destination, the prisoner reported him to the desk officer.

Caught: The Pc's 140mph speeding was reported by his criminal passenger when the pair arrived at Darlington Police Station (pictured)

Now PC Evans has been stripped of 
driving duties and a row has broken out after senior officers said he 
would not be prosecuted despite the offence ordinarily carrying a 
driving ban.

The constable 
from Durham Police was driving the prisoner, who had been arrested on 
suspicion of theft, from Leeds back to Darlington in a marked police BMW
 330.

In trouble: The driver sped for part of the journey between Leeds and Darlington and the prisoner promptly informed a custody officer when he arrived

A source said: ‘The 
conversation turned to the vehicle they were travelling in. Apparently 
the prisoner asked how fast it would go and the officer said something 
along the lines of, “I’ll show you”, or, “Let’s see”.

As soon as they 
got back to Darlington, the prisoner proceeded to tell the officer at 
the custody desk just how fast they had been going.’

Road
 safety campaigners condemned the decision not to prosecute. The law 
allows police, ambulance and fire service drivers to exceed the speed 
limit, but only in emergencies.

Joe
 Burns, from the charity Brake, said: ‘Driving at very high speeds on 
public roads poses a horrendous  danger, so anyone caught driving in 
this reckless way should face appropriately stiff penalties.’

Yesterday
 Supt Darren Ellis, head of professional standards at Durham Police, 
said the officer had been removed from road policing. He added: ‘After a
 thorough internal investigation the force has taken appropriate action.

‘The
 officer was an advanced and highly skilled police driver and there was 
no suggestion the vehicle was driven dangerously at any time. The 
officer’s conduct prior to the incident had been exemplary.’

He will not return to full operational duties until it is deemed appropriate.

The case had also been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for consideration.
