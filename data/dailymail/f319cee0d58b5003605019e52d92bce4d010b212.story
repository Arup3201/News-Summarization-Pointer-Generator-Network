Couldn't remember: Alycia Lane testified that wasn't able to recall when or where she had an Apple store worker clear her laptop's memory

A newsreader who allegedly had an affair with her married co-anchor had the defamation lawsuit that she filed against CBS and her supposed lover thrown out of court because she allegedly lied during her testimony.

Alycia Lane sued her former company for failing to investigate her claims that her colleague and alleged lover Larry Mendte was breaking into her email and sending out messages to other journalists from her account.

The relationship between Lane and  Mendte, former co-anchors for the Philadelphia CBS affiliate KYW, was exposed in a public he-said-she-said battle where their stories never gelled.

Mendte claims that their affair began in 2004 when Lane threw herself at him even though he was married. At one point, Lane allegedly attempted to seduce him by stripping only to her bra after he dropped her off at her apartment one evening.

On another occasion, he claims that she began straddling him while he was driving so that he had to pull over in order for the tryst to continue safely.

The two would also send each other text messages whilst they were on air with the numbers ‘1-4-3’ which were code for ‘I love you’.

The relationship soured when Mendte’s wife, Dawn Stensland, a news anchor on rival broadcaster Fox29, confronted him and he admitted his behavior.

Awkward: Seen in 2003 before their alleged affair began, Larry Mendte was married when he said that Alycia Lane attempted to seduce him by making out with him in his car and in her apartment

Lane denies the affair, saying that she 
refused his advances at a Christmas party by telling him: ‘A kiss is 
cheating, Larry. You're a married man.’

Joint appearance: Mendte, seen here with Lane in 2008, admitted that he did hack into her email account and send damaging emails to other reporters

One aspect of their affair that neither 
of them denies is that Mendte, upset about the end of their alleged 
affair, broke into Lane's work email and began sending messages to 
newspaper reporters throughout the city to damage her reputation.

He would pass on details about her personal life and relationship with her then husband just to get back at her.

Mendte admitted the email hacking to police, was fired from his $700,000-a-year job and served six months house arrest.

The legal spotlight then turned to Lane in December 2007, who was arrested for an unrelated case when she allegedly punched a plainclothes police woman during a trip to New York City, calling the officer a 'f****** dyke b****' during a drunken rage.

Those charges were dropped but it also prompted her bosses to drop her, as she was fired shortly after.

Emails between Lane and her lawyers following the New York City incident were also said to be some of the ones that Mendte leaked to fellow journalists.

The case showed the close-knit world of Philadelphia journalism, as Lane's lawyer tried to have an extensive, flirty string of emails between Lane and NFL Network sportscaster Rich Eisen.

Legal issues: Lane, seen with her then-boyfriend Chris Booker, was arrested but never charged with punching a police woman in the face during a trip to New York

Dating back to 2008, the married Eisen 
and then-single Lane wrote to each other referring to an encounter in 
Miami, and the regularly included extremely friendly phrases, like 'I'm 
sweet on you kid' (Eisen to Lane), and 'I'm just glad you're in my life 
=)' (Lane to Eisen).

Lane maintained that their relationship was platonic, though the pictures that she sent him of herself in a bikini made it difficult for many to believe.

The latest legal hurdle- Lane's defamation lawsuit against CBS and Mendte- has also been dropped as the judge claims that Lane lied during her testimony, hiding 'highly relevant' information.

New gig: Lane, seen here with a former intern, is now a weekend anchor in Los Angeles

Lane, who currently works as a weekend 
anchor in Los Angeles, argued that CBS did not sufficiently investigate 
her complaints that her email was being hacked before she found out it 
was Mendte behind the leak.

As a result, her computer records were extremely important to the case, making it an issue that she could not specifically remember when she went to an Apple store and had the staff clear out her hard drive- whether it was in the spring or summer of 2007, or if it was in New York or in Philadelphia.

CBS lawyers obtained records from the Apple store which shows that she had the laptop memory cleared in late 2008, after she filed the lawsuit, suggesting that she was deleting possible evidence.

Among the information that CBS lawyers feel was erased from the computer was a novel that Lane was drafting, detailing the incident that led to her arrest- and subsequent firing- in New York City.
