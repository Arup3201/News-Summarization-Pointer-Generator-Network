Economics teacher: Russell Woolwright (pictured today outside Bournemouth Crown Court) was allegedly 'pestered' with messages from the pupil

A public school girl sent flirty emails to a male teacher before performing a sex act on him, a court heard yesterday.

The teenager, who was studying at £30,000-a-year Canford School in Dorset, ‘pestered’ 30-year-old Russell Woolwright with messages asking him to meet her outside school, a jury heard.

One was even titled ‘Party in my pants’, it was claimed.

The unmarried economics teacher is alleged to have later kissed the girl and ‘caused or incited’ her to commit the sex act in an alleyway.

The court heard Woolwright was first sent a number of emails by a friend of the complainant who told him the girl ‘wants you’, followed by ‘hurry up Russy Wussy’. When Woolwright failed to show up for the meeting in nearby Wimborne, the alleged victim messaged him, saying: ‘Russ you’re being ******* gay. Come on Russ.’

A further email he received on his mobile phone sent by the complainant had the subject heading: ‘Party in my pants.’ Another allegedly boasted of her sexual prowess.

Police later learnt of the email exchange between the pair, prompting the girl to make the complaint of a breach of trust. At first she claimed Woolwright had kissed her but went on to describe the sex act in a second police interview after he denied her version of events.

Woolwright, who no longer works at Canford School, denies two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a girl as an adult in a position of trust.

Bournemouth Crown Court heard that Woolwright said he was shocked by the messages. He told police: ‘I started getting more emails and they started being more pestering. (She) sent the emails and said “party in my pants” and by that stage the alarm bells were really ringing.’

He said he tried to change the subject in the emails by joking with her, but when that failed he decided to meet with the girl to tell her to stop.

But he said that when they were talking the girl twice tried to kiss him, at which point he told her to leave him alone.

The court heard that in the days afterwards Woolwright contacted the girl and her friend several times to urge them to delete their emails.

He said: ‘I didn’t think it was necessarily appropriate to go to the headmaster about. I felt I could deal with it. I should never have put myself anywhere near that sort of position.’

David Bartlett, prosecuting, has told the jury: ‘You might conclude the girls were leading the defendant on. That does not excuse the defendant’s behaviour.’

Yesterday Woolwright denied Mr Bartlett’s allegation that he had gone to a secluded area to engage in sexual activity with the girl. ‘None of that happened,’ he said.

Woolwright, from Bristol, denies the charges. The trial continues.
