Chrissie Hynde once attempted - and famously failed - to sing it in Central Perk on Friends.

And now Phoebe Buffay's Smelly Cat has been covered in a tribute video to mark the US sit-com's 20th anniversary.

Charlotte Crosby, Ella Eyre and hip-hop duo Rizzle Kicks each take to the mic to perform lines from the catty tune, which first appeared in The One With The Baby On The Bus in 1995.

Dressed in a pink top, the newly single 2013 Celebrity Big Brother 2013 winner belts out her words with gusto, pairing her rendition with extravagant hand gestures and expressive facial movements.

The song Smelly Cat, was performed by ditzy Phoebe Buffay - played by Lisa Kudrow - in Central Perk, and it went on to be covered by Chrissie Hynde who appeared in the same episode.

It showed the Pretenders front woman being taken through how to play the tune on guitar, with Phoebe famously telling her she had got it wrong.

A host of British celebrities and singers, including Bluey Robinson, gave the song their own personal style

To mark the 20th anniversary of Friends, a real-life Central Perk coffee shop has opened in New York this month.

A queue stretched down the street as fans waited for their chance to recreate the iconic coffee shop scenes made famous by actors Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer and Matthew Perry during the show's ten-year run.
