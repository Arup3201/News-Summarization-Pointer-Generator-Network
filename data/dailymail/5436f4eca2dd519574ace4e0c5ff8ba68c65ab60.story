Wolverhampton Wanderers footballer Jamie O'Hara will close his Twitter account after sparking a social media fury yesterday following claims about his hard life as a professional footballer.

The former Tottenham Hotspur player - who is thought to be paid about £35,000 a week - posted a tweet where he appeared to bemoan his life situation, longing for 'easier' days on £100 a week.

O'Hara, 26, who is married to former Miss England Danielle Lloyd, 28, wrote: ‘Things were so much easier when I earned 100pound a week on wts #stress’.

Tough life: Jamie and Danielle O'Hara married in a lavish ceremony in May and she often posts tweets and pictures of their glam life together

Hard time: Jamie O'Hara, right, enraged his Twitter followers when he tweeted about the hard life of a footballer

The tweet referred to his days on the Youth Training Scheme, and it did not take long before he was bombarded with furious responses.

‘Why do people think cos I earn good money I don't have bills to pay we all pay tax an we have mortgages to pay, some people are deluded,’ O'Hara continued.

But after hundreds of tweets mocking him, the Wolves star revealed today that he will close his account.

'Had a good think last night and today is my last day on Twitter,' O'Hara wrote. 'I'll be starting a private Facebook account and anyone who is a genuine fan can send me a friend request.

'Too many trolls on here with nothing nice to say, sorry to people that actually like following me but I'll let you know what my Facebook account is.

'Thanks to my real fans on here. It's a shame that there's too many a******** would love to see some of them face to face because I'm sure they wouldn't say it to my face, they'd probably ask for a picture sums up society these days.'

Twitter users had accused O'Hara of being out of touch with the lives of ordinary people yesterday.

Easier then: The tweet from earlier today which caused a storm as it appeared Mr O'Hara complained about his lifestyle

Defence: The torrent of hateful tweets saw Mr O'Hara post further messages defending his original one

Christian Wainwright tweeted: 'Feel 
sorry for Jamie O'Hara, must be so stressful doing a few training 
sessions and playing 2 games a week for £1000s a week. #getagrip.'

Meanwhile
Nick Daniels tweeted: ‘Must be so hard being Jamie O'Hara , great 
career, beautiful wife, nice family, rich, Saturdays off and still he is
stressed! #prayforjamie.'

And Graeme Wallace tweeted: ‘Wish I had a hard life like professional footballer Jamie O'Hara.’

But O'Hara, who has two children 
- Archie, two, and Harry, one - with his wife Danielle hit back with 
references to his charity work.

He tweeted: ‘I wonder how many people are
doing hospital visits this Xmas or giving clothing to the homeless this
winter, or setting up a charity to raise money for hospitals Southey 
can buy equipment that save people lives, u can talk on here but what 
are YOU doing.’

But his tweet further angered Twitter users who called him a spoiled millionaire.

Aaron Ingham tweeted: ‘I see Jamie O'Hara's banging on about how charitable he is....after his disgusting tweet about life being easier when he earned £100 a week.’

Later O'Hara continued his rant, 
tweeting: ‘I'm not saying I'm not privileged I'm so lucky to have what 
I've got but trust me when I was 17 on wts it was a lot more easier.

‘Many peeps hating about me earning good
money that show how jealous u are, instead of realising the tweet was 
about how hard life gets.’

Glam WAG: Mrs O'Hara was pictured Christmas shopping in Liverpool city centre earlier today and was later seen enjoying a pampering session at Harvey Nichols Beauty Bazaar

Mr O'Hara posted that he wished he could reveal to his followers the real reason behind the original tweet but that there were 'too many a******** on twitter' and that 'people should worry about their own lives'.

The midfielder has been injured and unable to play for his team since August but returned to full training yesterday.

In July O'Hara was involved in a Twitter spat with Leon Knight after the ex-Chelsea player called his wife a ‘raging s**t bag’.

His own words: Jamie O'Haras twitter biography where he describes himself as a hard worker who will never 'forget where I've come from'

Enraged O'Hara retaliated: ‘If at @leonknight82 has got a problem he should give me a call instead of giving the bigun on twitter to a women with two kids.

‘And follow me and I'll direct message you my number, anytime mate, your a disgrace to your name go and do something with your life.’

Wolves were contacted by MailOnline but declined to comment.
