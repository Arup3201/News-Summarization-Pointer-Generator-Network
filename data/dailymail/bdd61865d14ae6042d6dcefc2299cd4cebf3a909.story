Radical preacher: Anjem Choudary was one of nine men arrested by officers in London this morning

Britain's most notorious Islamist hate preacher was arrested yesterday in a huge police operation.

Anjem Choudary, 47, was one of nine men held in a series of co-ordinated dawn raids by counter-terrorist police.

The show of force targeted the leadership of radical organisation Al-Muhajiroun, which he founded almost 20 years ago, and was later banned.

The arrests came on the eve of the first British air strikes on Islamic extremists waging war in Iraq and Syria.

Many of those held across London yesterday have been vocal cheerleaders of the bloodshed in the Middle East.

They included Choudary’s close friend, Trevor Brooks, who recently joined a wave of gloating by Islamists on social networks over the murders of hostages at the hands of the British terrorist known as Jihadi John.

Experts expressed amazement that it had taken so long for police to take action against the outspoken firebrand preacher.

But the operation was launched only after careful consideration of Choudary’s recent public comments against the backdrop of a lifetime of incitement.

Sources said the lawyer turned preacher and his followers had become considerably ‘more brazen’ since the explosion of violence in Iraq.

Choudary has stepped up his online rhetoric, bombarding his  followers with rabble-rousing messages and handing out leaflets in Oxford Street.

Scotland Yard said it arrested nine men, aged between 22 and 51, in raids across the capital, and on a property in Stoke.

Officers searched 18 addresses across London, including two Tower Hamlets sweet shops run by Choudary’s brother Yazdani. They have seized numerous phones, laptops and desktop computers which have been passed to forensic experts for analysis.

All the men were held on suspicion of being a member of, or backing a banned terrorist group and supporting terrorism. The alleged offences, which come under two counter- terrorism acts, carry a maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment.

Choudary was arrested at an unknown location after fleeing his home two weeks ago in the middle of the night in the wake of threats from far-Right groups.

Just hours before he was held, he posted a burst of nine inflammatory messages on Twitter, branding the US bombing raids as a ‘rallying call for Muslims’ and labelling the actions of Western governments in Muslim countries as ‘terrorism’.

As recently as last weekend, Choudary made inflammatory remarks about British aid worker Alan Henning, who is being held hostage in Syria.

He blamed the British Government for Mr Henning’s fate because of its ‘complicity in torture and rendition’ and said he would never feel sympathy for the 47-year-old.

He said: ‘In the Koran it is not allowed for you to feel sorry for non-Muslims. I don’t feel sorry for him.’ Choudary also said the Islamic State was building the sort of society he would ‘love to live in’ with his family. But the father of four, who has spent years living off state benefits, said he would not leave Britain because he was born here.

Comments: Choudary's arrest came shortly after he posted a series of nine tweets at about 5am today with an anti-Western tone, referring to the ongoing crisis involving ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria

His right-hand man Brooks, a former acolyte of Omar Bakri Mohammed and Abu Hamza, was also quietly arrested yesterday. Neighbours said Brooks, 39, now known as Abu Izzadeen, was driven away by plain-clothes detectives.

Brooks has revelled in the bloodshed in Syria, taunting Prime Minister David Cameron within minutes of the latest video showing the murder of David Haines.

Others held by police included Mizanur Rahman, 31, an online extremist preacher and key lieutenant of Choudary. The former East London web designer boasts of being a student of Omar Bakri and runs a prominent website dedicated to broadcasting his vile views under the name Abu Baraa.

Another suspect to be questioned was Abdul Muhid, 32, who was recently seen canvassing students outside the London School of Economics, and has been described as a ‘stalwart’ of Al-Muhajiroun.

Choudary has been an inspirational figure for a generation of Muslim extremists, including the fanatics behind the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich. He led Al- Muhajiroun, which was repeatedly rebranded in a bid to evade attempts to proscribe its activities.

Members gathered under a series of names including al-Ghuraba, Islam4UK and Muslims Against Crusades, but their Islamist mission has always remained the same.

Campaigners welcomed the arrests but said they should have been made sooner.

Nick Lowles, of Hope Not Hate, said: ‘For over a year, since our own extensive investigations into Anjem Choudary and his disciples, we’ve been saying that more must be done to curb this hate-supporting and recruiting organisation.

Choudary: He has vowed to recruit in prison

By Vanessa Allen

Seen as a recruiting sergeant for Britain’s radical Muslims, Anjem Choudary has played a cynical cat-and-mouse game with British authorities.

But the self-styled ‘sheikh’ has been careful to keep his incendiary speeches on the right side of Britain’s hate law.

His comments that Woolwich murder victim Fusilier Lee Rigby would ‘burn in hellfire’ and calls for an anti-war march through Wootton Bassett, the Wiltshire town that honoured  soldiers who died in Afghanistan, were repugnant, but deemed not to have crossed the threshold for criminal prosecution.

His network of supporters, the banned group Al-Muhajiroun, has been the focus of attention for the authorities, yet Choudary has never faced any serious prosecutions.

Worryingly, he has warned that jailing him will give him access to a new, captive congregation to radicalise inside prison.

Speaking after a Home Office banning order, the preacher said: ‘If they arrest me and put me in prison, I will carry on in prison. I’ll radicalise everyone in prison.’

Choudary, a trained solicitor, has been immersed in radical Islamism since the 1990s when he and firebrand cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed formed Al-Muhajiroun.

The group’s supporters praised the September 11 terror atrocity and the July 7 London bombings which killed 52 innocent people in 2005.

Choudary has preached that jihad,  or holy war, is an ‘obligation  upon Muslims’ – an interpretation rejected by moderate Muslim scholars – and has called for a draconian  form of Sharia law to be imposed across Britain.

Public lashings for the sale of alcohol, amputations for thieves and stoning to death for adulterers would all form part of that dystopian vision.

Yet Choudary himself was known as a hard-drinking womaniser with a penchant for excess while studying medicine at Southampton University.

The son of a market trader from Welling, Kent, he was known as Andy and switched his studies to law after failing his first-year medical exams, before embracing extremism. Scotland Yard has continued to monitor his speeches and online comments for potential breaches of the law.

Meanwhile it has simultaneously  provided him with police protection after far-Right groups threatened to attack him.

Uniformed officers were stationed outside his home in East London last year after it emerged that Woolwich murderers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale had both attended Al-Muhajiroun demonstrations.

Al-Muhajiroun was officially disbanded after it was banned under anti-terror legislation in 2004 but critics have argued that subsequent spin-off groups formed by Choudary espoused the same radical beliefs and aims.

Choudary has called for the ‘flag of Sharia’ to fly over Downing Street and for Britain to be conquered by an Islamic country.

Yet his apparent disdain for Britain has not stopped the married father of four claiming up to £25,000 a year in benefits from the British taxpayer.

Radicalised at 17: Abu Izzadeen

Radicalised when he was 17, fanatic Abu Izzadeen came to notoriety during hate-filled speeches outside Regent’s Park mosque.

The British extremist - born Trevor Brooks - said soldiers were ‘crusaders’ who would rape and murder Iraqi women and children.

The married father of three urged a boycott of the Poppy Appeal, claiming anyone who wore a poppy to mark Remembrance Day ‘supported the  murder of Muslims’.

Izzadeen, 39, who once called the July 7 London suicide bombers ‘praise- worthy’, was born to a respectable Jamaican family in Hackney, East London, but shed his Christian identity on the eve of his 18th birthday.

He was said to have been radicalised by Syrian cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and hate preacher Abu Hamza at Finsbury Park mosque and joined Anjem Choudary’s Al-Muhajiroun.

The former electrician and fluent Arabic speaker spent more than a decade preaching and calling for Britain to become an Islamic state and travelled in Pakistan before the September 11 attacks, as part of Al-Muhajiroun.

In 2006, Izzadeen told then home secretary John Reid he was an ‘enemy of Islam’ after the minister asked Muslims to step in if they thought children were being radicalised. In an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he denounced then prime minister Tony Blair as a ‘murderer’.

During an address to his supporters, he was filmed as he said Muslims who joined the Army should face the death penalty under Sharia law, saying their heads should be ‘removed’.

Like Choudary, he has lived off the state, claiming up to £1,000 a month in benefits while living in a council house in Leyton, East London.

He joined Muslims Against Crusades, which burnt a poppy on Remembrance Sunday in 2010 and whose supporters targeted a forces’ homecoming parade in Luton.

Protests by the group and its offshoots featured chants such as ‘British soldiers burn in hell’ and banners including ‘Hell for Heroes’.

Izzadeen, who married his wife Mokhtaria in 1998, when he was 23, advertised on the internet for three more wives and said he wanted ‘more than nine children’.

The radical described himself as ‘the life and soul of the party’ in the ad on a Muslim dating site and described his personality as ‘passionate, bold, protective, witty and sensitive’.
