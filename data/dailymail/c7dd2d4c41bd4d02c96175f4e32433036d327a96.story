As the cold weather firmly sets in, you may feel those winter blues creeping up on you with a vengeance.

The perfect cure? Escaping to a tropical ocean villa, situated off the coast of a remote island, propped up over crystal-clear seas.

Take inspiration from Trivago's top overwater getaways, from the bungalows of Bora Bora to an underwater restaurant in the Maldives and where Tom Hanks filmed his film blockbuster Castaway.

The Intercontinental Le Moana in Bora Bora, French Polynesia boasts two restaurants, a cocktail lounge and spa services nearby

Intercontinental Le Moana - Bora Bora, French Polynesia

Bora Bora in French Polynesia is undeniably home to some of the most picturesque above-water bungalow resorts, pioneered in the region by Intercontinental.

Suspended on stilts between the ocean and the lagoon, Intercontinental has secured the best location in the archipelago - and Le Moana is no exception.

Complete with two restaurants, a cocktail lounge and with spa services nearby, the hotel is certainly among one of the most beautiful in the world.

And the luxurious resort has also managed to stay true to its Polynesian roots, with hats, baskets and mats created from coconut palm leaves the sort of souvenirs on sale. Additionally, guests can shop for Monoi oil (renowned for its medical properties) and even scoop up some loose pearls from vendors nearby. 

Above-water bungalows were pioneered in the region by Intercontinental - and as such, the hotel has nabbed some of the most prime areas

There are 63 guest-rooms situated throughout the resort, each with a fantastic view of the crystal-clear ocean right outside the door
