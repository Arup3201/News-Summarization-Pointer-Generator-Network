Jurors today were shown video of the alleged Zumba prostitute dropping her towel and posing naked in front of the windows of her Maine exercise studio - the raciest evidence so far in the trial of Alexis Wright's business partner.

Mark Strong's lawyers admit that the footage, which appears to be amateur porn Wright shot, is shocking, but they say it has no bearing on the case and that it will only bias the jury. 

Jurors also saw about two dozen pictures Strong captured on his home computer while he watched live Skype broadcasts of Wright allegedly having sex with johns in her Zumba exercise studio.

Explicit: Prosecutors played a video of Alexis Wright, 30, stripping off and teasing construction workers across the street from her exercise studio

For all to see: The video played for jurors shows Wright stripping out of her towel while standing in the window of her Pure Vida Zumba exercise studio in downtown Kennebunk, Maine

Not guilty: Mark Strong (right) admits he had an affair with Wright and his lawyers concede he may have watched video of her having sex with other men - but they argue he didn't know she was running an alleged prostitution business

The grainy video footage played in court depicts a woman identified at Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, parading around her Pure Vida Studio wearing nothing but a towel. She describes how she is trying to get the attention of construction workers across the street a she stands in front of the windows of her business.

'I’m going to try and get them to come over and have some fun,' she says as she stands on a chair in full view of downtown Kennebunk.

She drops her towel as she slowly tears a sign off the window.

'He’s taken notice. They’ve both taken notice. And now they’re watching.'

Later, she appears to unlock the door a let a man inside, according to Seacoast Online.

Strong, a married father of two, says he funded Wright's exercise
studio with a loan and acted as her business partner.

He also admits that he had an affair with her and his lawyers concede that he may have watched her online as she had sex with other men.

Seductive: Mark Strong, a married father of two,
allegedly sat at his home computer and watched Alexis Wright have sex 
with several men via live-streaming video over Skype

On trial: Strong has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of promoting prostitution and one count of invasion of privacy

However, his lawyers argue Strong, a local real estate broker and private investigator, had no idea Wright was allegedly receiving money for the sex or that she was running a prostitution business.

The 57-year-old faces 12 counts of promotion of prostitution and a single count of invasion of privacy. He has pleaded not guilty.

Detectives say they recovered 13,000 still images from Strong's computer, many of them sexually explicit pictures that he captured from videos of Wright having sex with alleged johns.

Prosecutors initially wanted to show 577 to the jury.

'This is visual surveillance of the prostitution itself,' Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan argued, according to the Portland Press-Herald.

Defense lawyers strenuously objected before the material was introduced and continued to object after jurors saw the video and the pictures. They say Strong is just a 'voyeur.'

Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, is slated to stand trial in May. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges

'It
may be Mr. Strong observed the sexual acts of Ms. Wright with other 
people, but I don't think it shows promotion of prostitution,' Daniel 
Lilley told the judge.

'These are all very sexual acts and very sexual positions.'

Jurors also were given sheets with 21,000 text messages that Strong and Wright exchanged  between February 2010 and February 2012.

Defense lawyers strenuously objected to the video shown on Wednesday, saying that it did not pertain to allegations to that Strong was involved in the case.

On Wednesday, Justice Nancy Mills ruled that the prosecution should show only 100 of the photos to the jury - to illustrate the Wright invited multiple men into her studio for sex on multiple occasions.

Wright's alleged clients include wealthy and well-known figures in southern Maine. So far, 18 men have pleaded guilty to paying Wright for sex

The video isn't the only time the jury heard about Wright's escapades involving a towel. Last week, a pizza delivery driver testified that she answered the door in a towel when he delivered spaghetti and meatballs to her.

She then dropped the towel and handed him a $40 tip.

Witness Dan Racaniello said he felt that Wright was 'coming on to him' and that he resisted her urgings.

Wright
kept meticulous records, prosecutors say, and her list of clients - 
many of whom have admitted to charges of patronizing a prostitute - 
include well-known lawyers, businessmen and politicians from across 
southern Maine.

Wright has pleaded not guilty to charges of prostitution and invasion of privacy. Her trial is scheduled for May.
