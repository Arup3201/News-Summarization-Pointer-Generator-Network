A lemon-sized skull unearthed in Montana is evidence of the earliest horned dinosaur species ever found in North America. 

It belongs to a distant relative of Triceratops, called Aquilops americanus, which was markedly smaller and lighter than its truck-sized ancestors.

The discovery could help palaeontologists understand how horned dinosaurs evolved their fierce facial features.

A lemon-sized skull unearthed in Montana is evidence of the earliest horned dinosaur species ever found in North America. It belongs to a distant relative of Triceratops, called Aquilops americanus, which was markedly smaller and lighter than its truck-sized ancestors

Experts have struggled for decades to reconstruct the early evolutionary history of Ceratopsia – herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs - in North America, because of a limited fossil record, but this latest discovery could shed new light.

The dinosaur name means ‘American eagle face’.

It would have weighed just three pounds (1.4kg), and was the size of a small cat, measuring just two feet long (61cm), according to the study published in Plos One.

It lived in the Early Cretaceous Period - around 108 million years ago. 

Its diminutive size contrasts with its later, and more famous relative, Triceratops, which weighed 4,000 times more.

Record: Aquilops Americanus is the earliest known horned dinosaur species in North America.

Name: The animal's Latin name means American eagle face.

Skull features: A distinctive hooked beak-like structure and a pointed cavity on its cheeks.

Age: The creature lived in the Early Cretaceous Period. The fossil is thought to be 108 million years old.

Weight: Three lbs (1.4kg).

Size: Two ft long (61cm).

Family: It's a distant relative of Triceratops.

Relevance: The fossil could help palaeontologists understand how horned dinosaurs evolved.

Discovery: The fossil was unearthed in 1997 in Montana.

Aquilops’ skull measures just over three inches (8cm) long, and has a distinctive hooked beak-like structure and a pointed cavity on its cheeks.

The dinosaur lacks the later species’ trademark head shield and facial horns and is comparatively ‘no frills,’ experts at the Sam Noble Museum in Oklahoma said.

The fossil was discovered by a team of paleontologists led by Rich Cifelli in 1997, and the dinosaur is now considered the oldest member of the horned dinosaur lineage in North America.

Andrew Farke, the from Raymond M. Alf Museum of Palaeontology in Claremont, California, who led the study, told the BBC that the animal is closely related to similar species in Asia. 

‘Aquilops lived nearly 20 million years before the next oldest horned dinosaur named from North America.

‘Even so, we were surprised that it was more closely related to Asian animals than those from North America.’ 

Experts predict that by studying other horned fossil records, they will find that the ancestors of Aquilops may have come from Asia.

The dinosaur lacks the later species’ trademark head shield and facial horns and is comparatively ‘no frills,’ according to one expert. A 3D-printed version of the skill is pictured on a Triceratops' skull, to give people an idea of how small the newly-discovered dinosaur was

The fossil record suggests horned dinosaurs arose in Asia and spread to North America near the Bering Strait by about 108 million years ago - the age of Aquilops. Surprisingly, however, the study places Aquilops near the base of this tree, removed from horn-bearing Triceratops and other relatives (diagram pictured)

If this proves true, it would support theories of an ‘intercontinental migratory event’ between Asia and North America, which palaeontologists think may have occurred in the late Early Creataceous, between 113 million and 105 million years ago.

Experts have created 3D models of the dinosaur and will add details to it as they learn more about the prehistoric creature.

The skull itself will be featured in a new exhibit in the museum’s Hall of Ancient Life and will sit alongside its Pentaceratops, which holds the Guinness World Record for being the largest dinosaur skull ever found.

Triceratops (pictured) first appeared in the late Cretaceous period, about 68 million years ago and unlike its earlier relative, was the size of a truck. A scale model being crafted for the film Jurassic Park, is shown
