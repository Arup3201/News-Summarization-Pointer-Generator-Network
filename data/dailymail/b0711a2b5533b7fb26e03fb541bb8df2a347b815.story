When Janina Wasiuta was unable to use her normal parking space, she left her car on a slip road at a supermarket yards from the beauty salon where she works.

But she returned to find to her horror that staff at the Aldi store had smashed a window to get in, then pushed the Ford Fiesta into a bush, scratching the body.

They claimed the ten-year-old vehicle had been obstructing a delivery lorry trying to use the private access road.

Dumped: Janina Wasiuta finished work to discover 
her red £4,000 Ford Fiesta pushed off the road with the driver’s window 
in pieces and glass over the seat

In a bush: The beauty therapist, who works just a 
hundred yards away, had moved from her regular parking spot which was 
closed due to maintenance work

Angry: Miss Wasiuta said there were no double yellow lines or signs telling her she couldn't park in the road

Yesterday beauty therapist Miss 
Wasiuta, 29, accused Aldi of vandalising her car, which was towed to a 
garage for repairs. She has reported staff to police.

‘It’s
 unbelievable – I’ve basically had my car vandalised by a big 
supermarket chain,’ she said yesterday. ‘I’ve been told it will take two
 weeks to repair it, which means I’m paying £8 a day in taxi fares – on 
top of my £95 insurance excess.

‘If
 someone blocked my drive and I damaged their car trying to move it, I’d
 have the police round. Why should Aldi be any different? The store’s 
attitude was disgusting – they didn’t even put a note on my window, they
 just left the car in a bush. There are no double yellow lines or signs.
 There were cars parked behind me and I don’t see how my car was causing
 an obstruction.

‘The 
salon’s only a moment away – why did no one come in to see if it 
belonged to an employee or a customer before smashing their way in?’

Yesterday three plastic barriers had been put up in an effort to stop people parking on the access road in Chorley, Lancashire.

Aldi
 said: ‘We have apologised to Miss Wasiuta and are covering all costs of
 the damage to her vehicle and all the associated expenses.

‘As a very last resort we had to move a vehicle that was preventing an Aldi delivery truck from reversing into the loading bay.

'Our
 store staff had searched for the owner for more than four hours. They 
also contacted the local police to try and obtain the registered owner’s
 details.

'Unfortunately these were not available.

'After every other option was taken into consideration, the car was then moved by Aldi staff.

'The owner of the car returned at approximately 9pm, three hours after we moved it.

Staff at the Aldi say they were forced to break into the car so a delivery driver could access the store

'We
 are in communication with the car owner to rectify the damage caused, 
have offered to pay for all repairs and have apologised for any 
inconvenience.'

Lancashire County Council said: 'It’s not an LCC highway. It’s a private road.'

While police can 
tow away a vehicle causing an obstruction on a public road, rules of 
trespass apply to a car parked on private land, legal experts say.

The
 landowner could claim for trespass but any award would be likely to be 
as low as £20. And anyone damaging a car while trying to move it could 
be sued in the small claims court and face prosecution for criminal 
damage.

Paul Watters, from 
the AA, said: ‘Motorists who cause an obstruction are a source of great 
frustration, but taking direct action in the knowledge it will cause 
damage to the car is completely unacceptable.’

Police are investigating last Friday’s incident as possible criminal damage.
