In a victory for the gay rights movement, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Monday that it will not hear appeals from five states seeking to prohibit same-sex marriages, paving the way for an expansion of unions between homosexuals.

The decision doesn't immediately fling open the courthouse doors to couples previously denied the right to marry, but makes it likely that earlier appeals court decisions will take effect as soon as judges lift the 'stays' they ordered while the nation's highest court examined the cases.

There are still numerous gay-marriage court cases wending their way through lower courts, but the justices declined to immediately review decisions affecting couples only in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.

It's likely the Supreme Court is waiting to get a fuller picture of how the nation's judiciary views the contentious issue.

Supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage often clash on courthouse steps, but the rainbow-flag brigade got the upper hand on Monday

But for the moment it appears likely that gays and lesbians in at least those five states – and as many as 11 – will be able to marry soon. 

 The high court will likely weigh in only when two or more federal appeals courts disagree sharply on whether gay Americans should be able to tie the knot. 

All five of the cases before the nine justices were appeals from states affected by rulings that legalized the practice.

The Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals is the most likely one to put the issue on the Supreme Court's plate. That district includes Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told an audience three weeks ago at the University of Minnesota School of Law that 'there will be some urgency' to decide the issue once and for all if judges on that court uphold gay-marriage bans. 

But she said then that if the appeals panel in Cincinnati agrees with the cases that the Supreme Court rejected on Monday, there will be 'no need for us to rush.' 

A similar case sits in the traditionally liberal Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, Legal observers say there's virtually no chance that court will side with those who advocate for a strictly traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman.

The gay rights movement has seen remarkably fast movement toward a new national standard that would prohibit government officials from distinguishing among between same-sex and traditional marriages

Ginsberg and her eight black-robed colleagues offered no comment Monday in rejecting the only gay marriage appeals cases they had on their potential docket.

The Associated Press reported Monday that the court's order immediately ends delays on marriage in the five affected states.

But gay couples in six other states – Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming – will also be bound by the ruling since they are part of the same appeals-court districts.

If it all shakes out according to gay-rights activists' plans, there will shortly be 30 U.S. states where the practice will be legal

High court declined to immediately review gay marriage bans in five states

Decision leaves lower court rulings in place for now and will likely affect every – 11 in all – in federal court districts where Monday's cases reside

@highlight

A sixth appeals court, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, could still buck the trend and uphold a ban

The Supreme Court is likely waiting to act until there's some disagreement at the federal appeals court level

One justice said last month that 'there will be some urgency' to act if that happens
