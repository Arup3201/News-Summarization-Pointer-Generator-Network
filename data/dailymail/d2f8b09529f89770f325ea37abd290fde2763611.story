Joe Hart considers Sergio Aguero to be a better finisher than Lionel Messi.

The England goalkeeper has backed his Manchester City team-mate ahead of the Barcelona star when it comes to their natural ability to score.

Messi is always put forward as one of the greatest to ever play the game when the debate is raised, but Hart believes Aguero has the advantage when it comes to tucking them away.

Hart works with Aguero on a day-to-day basis at Manchester City and is impressed with what he's seen

‘From working with him on a daily basis and from what I've seen this season, Aguero just knows how to score,’ Hart explained.

‘In training he particularly excites you most days but he's also got that ability on the day to do it. We've got a good team, but a long clearance could turn into a goal because he's got that ability to take it round five people and score.

‘It's a great thing to have. Sergio is a very natural player and in a situation one-on-one there is nothing complicated about it. He takes that option to score. Messi is absolutely awesome, he is a phenomenal player, but I'm backing Sergio.’

Messi could not find a way past Hart over the two legs and missed a penalty at the Etihad Stadium

Hart has faced Messi four times in the past two season, not conceding to the Argentine at all this campaign but twice last year, a penalty and a delicate strike.

‘He scored past me with the outside of his foot,’ Hart said. ‘He managed to dink it back past my shoulder and didn't have the momentum to do that, he shouldn't have been able to do that, but it appeared like a very simple finish for him. He's definitely one of the best players I've ever played against.’

Hart got one over Messi by saving his penalty in their Champions League last-16, second-leg tie last week, but he takes no credit for the stop.

‘The only reason he missed is because he probably didn't take it as well as he wanted to,’ Hart added. ‘I don't think it was down to me.

‘I'm sure in years to come when potentially he's being honoured as the greatest player ever to play football then it will be a nice one to have.’

Aguero is third-top goalscorer in the Premier League this season behind Diego Costa and Harry Kane
