A hungover farmer found the body of his missing girlfriend lying in a lane the morning after he had run her over in a drunken stupor.

John Dent, 49, who had drunk nine pints of beer and had no memory of hitting Rose-Marie Valente, awoke at his farm the next day and could not understand where she had gone.

He went out to search for her and was shocked to find her body in a country lane close to his farm in Brough, Cumbria.

Death by careless driving: John Dent (left), 49, of Brough, Cumbria, drove home from a pub after Rose-Marie Valente (right), 49, left without him - but was so drunk on nine pints of beer that he knocked her down in his 4x4

Dent called police, still unaware that he had accidentally mown her down in his 4x4 himself. Forensic tests later showed she had died from catastrophic injuries caused by his silver Mitsubishi pick-up.

He told police he was so drunk at the time he did not remember driving into Miss Valente, 49.Yesterday he pleaded guilty at Carlisle Crown Court to causing death by careless driving while over the drink-drive limit.

He was jailed for six years and banned from driving for three years. ‘I accept I am guilty despite my lack of recollection,’ he admitted.

The jury heard he had been in an on-off relationship with the mother-of-five for more than ten years.

Drinking: Miss Valente left the Castle Hotel (pictured) in Brough, Cumbria, at about 8.40pm to walk back to the farm, leaving Dent in the pub. But despite being very drunk, he decided to drive home an hour later

he was spending a weekend at the farm he shared with his parents when the couple went out on Sunday, February 27, last year.

'It was an appalling human tragedy for all concerned. He had drunk so much he just didn’t know what he was doing'

Judge Paul Batty QC

Miss Valente, of Bingley, West Yorkshire, left the Castle Hotel at Brough at 8.40pm to walk back to the farm, leaving Dent in the pub.

Around an hour later, a drunken Dent climbed behind the wheel of his 4x4 and drove to the farm.

During the journey he accidentally hit her, causing fatal injuries.But oblivious to what he had done, he carried on. When he arrived home, he drank vodka with his father before going to bed.

The following morning – ten hours after the accident – Dent realised Miss Valente had not turned up and went out looking for her.

He was arrested for failing a breath test after he found her body and called police.

Hearing: Carlisle Crown Court (pictured) in Cumbria was told that the victim, a mother of five from Bingley, West Yorkshire, had been in an 'on and off' relationship with Dent for nearly 10 years

In a statement submitted to the court, Dent said he had no memory of the accident but accepted all the evidence showed he had been responsible, and was ‘extremely remorseful’.

Dent was first charged with causing 
death by dangerous driving but this was reduced to causing death by 
careless driving after discussions between the police, prosecutors and 
Miss Valente’s family.

'Rose was a loving and supportive mother and grandparent. We will miss her terribly and are devastated by this'

Family of Rose-Marie Valente

Judge Paul Batty QC said: ‘It was an appalling human tragedy for all concerned.

‘He had drunk so much he just didn’t know what he was doing and that is a serious aggravating feature of the case.’

The victim’s family said: ‘Rose was a loving and supportive mother and grandparent and we will miss her terribly and are devastated by this.’

Detective Inspector Furzana Nazir, of Cumbria Police, said: ‘This was a tragic case in which Mr Dent had consumed that much alcohol he was no longer aware of his actions.

‘He got behind the wheel of his car and attempted to drive home. Miss Valente, who had left the pub some time before, was on her way to where she was staying when tragedy struck and Dent knocked her over.

‘Our thoughts are with the family. Miss Valente was the mother of five children who are still coming to terms with what happened.’
