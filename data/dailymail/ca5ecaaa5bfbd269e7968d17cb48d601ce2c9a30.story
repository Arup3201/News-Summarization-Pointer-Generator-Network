They are perennial Premier League title contenders, always there or thereabouts when the medals are handed out in May.

But Chelsea and Manchester City have also established themselves as the pre-eminent forces in youth football, from the Under-21 standard that is one step away from the first team right down to the Under 11s just starting out.

Both clubs have invested millions of pounds into their academies as they aim to create a conveyor belt of talent good enough to play for their first team and they are starting to see a return.

Rising star: City's Marcos Lopes, pictured here in the UEFA Youth League match with Bayern Munich in which he scored three times in a 6-0 win, has been loaned out to Ligue 1 side Lille to gain experience 

At Chelsea, owner Roman Abramovich has put in at least £100m to make the club's training facility at Cobham world class, while City will later this year open a £150m academy a stone's throw from the Etihad Stadium.

A look at the various competitions in the age groups from 21 downwards show Chelsea and City are increasingly going head-to-head in the latter stages.

Chelsea won the Under 21 Premier League last season by beating Manchester United 2-1 in the final at Old Trafford, but they had defeated City on penalties in the semi-final after a goalless draw.

Charly Musonda and Lewis Baker, two of Chelsea's most exciting young prospects, were on target to deliver the trophy to Stamford Bridge.

Indeed, Jose Mourinho said recently that if Baker and other club prodigies Izzy Brown and Dominic Solanke don't go on to represent England, he will be to blame.

City reached the final of the inaugural Under 21 Premier League Cup but lost out 4-3 on aggregate to Reading over two legs.

They had looked good to lift the trophy after two goals from Devante Cole and another from Marcos Lopes gave them a 3-2 advantage at home but Reading won the second leg 2-0 and turned the tie around.

In the first season of the Under 19 UEFA Youth League, both teams registered some impressive results as they progressed to the quarter-finals.

City's 6-0 rout of Bayern Munich in the group phase sent shockwaves across the continent - there were five English names on their teamsheet, though Portuguese star Marcos Lopes stole the show with a hat-trick.

Chelsea achieved a 100 per cent record in the group and then thrashed AC Milan 4-1, with Baker scoring a wondergoal, before they bowed out to Schalke.

With the frontiers of youth football expanding beyond these shores, both City and Chelsea will be targeting European success in the season to come.

This will only intensify with the introduction of a continental competition for Under 21 teams in 2014-2015 with both taking part. 

In the FA Youth Cup, an Under 18 competition, Chelsea stormed to their fourth final in five seasons and won their third competition in that time as they beat local rivals Fulham in a classic two-legged final.

Fulham won the first leg 3-2 at Craven Cottage and led by the same scoreline at Stamford Bridge before a rousing Chelsea fightback, capped by two Solanke goals, earned them the Cup.

While Chelsea dominated in the Cup, City came close in the Premier League at Under 18 level.

After topping the Northern Section, they saw off West Ham before losing 1-0 to Everton in the final at Goodison Park.

Their dominance is even more pronounced beneath Under 18 level.

In the Under 16 age bracket, the Premier League stages tournaments and festivals instead of a league format in order to allow players to make the transition to full-size 11 vs 11 matches.

At the last Premier League International Tournament, held back in October, Chelsea triumphed after beating Real Madrid 2-0 in the final at Warwick University.

The game was notable for an audacious 40-yard free-kick by Chelsea's Mukhtar Ali that soared over the Real goalkeeper's head.

Moving younger still and guess which two teams contested the final of the Premier League at Under 14 level?

An eight-team finals tournament was held at the London Soccerdome and City recovered from 2-0 down to beat Chelsea and retain the crown at that age group.

And it was the same story at the recent Under 13 International Tournament, also held at Warwick.

The Premier League invited Porto, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven to take on the leading nine English clubs and Chelsea and City emerged from the pack to contest the final.

After a 1-1 draw, Chelsea won 6-5 in a penalty shoot-out that were to sudden death.

With City also the reigning champions at Under 11 level, it demonstrates that Chelsea and their Manchester rivals are taking a firm stranglehold on youth competition at all ages.

The positive rewards of their academy investment are starting to filter through an age range of over 10 years from Under 21s to Under 11s and it is up to others to play catch-up.

However, it will be argued that until both of these club's first teams are full of academy graduates, the investment is not reaping its full reward.
