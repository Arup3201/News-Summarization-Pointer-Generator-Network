To say Diego Maradona’s presence will loom large as Argentina try to win the World Cup for the first time since 1986 does not go far enough. His face will be in the Maracana dressing room before kick-off and on the pitch too.

So fond is Ezequiel Lavezzi of Maradona, and body art for that matter, he has a tattoo of the national icon heading a ball inked on to his hip.

It is a startling tribute to a player Lavezzi has  himself been compared with. Lionel Messi does not hold the patent on such matters.

Clearly Messi is the one doing his utmost to retell the narrative from Mexico 86, when a modest group was propelled to glory thanks to a diminutive virtuoso of huge talent.

But were the Barcelona star to have another match of minimal impact, as against Holland in the semi-final, then others will need to step up to beat Germany.

Lavezzi could be that man. He is another stocky forward of skill and speed, and earned that Maradona comparison by becoming a hero at Napoli. Those fans adored him as one third of a triumvirate with Edinson Cavani and Marek Hamsik as Napoli challenged for Serie A and won Coppa Italia.

There is a rock ’n’ roll edge to his personality that echoes Maradona, demonstrated by several tattoos, including an evil clown on his shoulder and a handcuffed pocket-watch on his back, alongside portraits of Jesus and the Virgin Mary (his Christian name means ‘God strengthens’).

After a Champions League game against Manchester City  in 2011, Lavezzi was seen with Sergio Aguero opening a bottle of beer with his teeth and he once said: ‘If I have a chance to party then I will, no problem.’

Rather than Maradona, Lavezzi would reference a likeness to Carlos Tevez, sharing a dogged personality fused with nimbleness, vision and bursts of pace.

Those are the attributes Lavezzi has brought to this World Cup with his influence growing as the tournament has progressed. Coming on as a late substitute against Iran he passed to Messi then darted into the area, creating just enough uncertainty for Messi to curl in a superb winner.

Injuries to Angel Di Maria and Aguero have promoted Lavezzi to starting roles and against  Holland he was one of the better players, bustling into space and linking play, albeit unable to  conjure a moment of magic.

At 29, he has reached the  pinnacle of his career, winning two Ligue 1 titles after moving to Paris St-Germain for €30million. He holds his own in a team including Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

And yet at 17 he gave up the game, frustrated in the lower  levels of Argentina, and spent 18 months out as an apprentice electrician. Estudiantes offered him a way back then, and Chelsea are reported to be interested now — little wonder after he has twice pulled them apart in the Champions League. In 2012 he scored a brace in Naples and this year once in Paris.

He has suffered heartache away from football too. In February he celebrated a goal by pointing to the skies days after his uncle Jorge, his first coach, had been shot dead in Rosario.

Humour remains though, and he was caught on camera  squirting water over Argentina manager Alejandro Sabella  during the World Cup group stage clash with Nigeria.

Others managers might have hooked him on the spot, but Sabella is more relaxed, which is useful when there is a World Cup to be won and Lavezzi could provide the spark to seal it.
