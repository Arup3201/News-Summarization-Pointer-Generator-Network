The New York mother who was killed in Turkey had been hanging out with 'a criminal element' while on the solo trip, a source familiar with the murder investigation has claimed.

FBI agents investigating the killing of Sarai Sierra, who was found bludgeoned to death on Saturday, do not believe she had only travelled to the country to take pictures, as her family has claimed.

'The first people she met up with were a criminal element,' the source told the New York Post. 'There are some 
witness reports that she was seen with sketchy characters.'

Authorities are now trying to verify these claims amid reports that her casket will be sent back to the United States on Thursday, the Post reported.

Murdered:
The body of amateur photographer Sarai Sierra was found in Istanbul on 
Saturday; now authorities are investigating claims she hung out with a 'criminal element' while on the solo trip

Among various lines of inquiry investigators are looking into a possible connection to drug trafficking.

Sierra, who had been unemployed and had declared bankruptcy in 2005, had also travelled to Amsterdam and Munich while on the trip, which was her first time leaving the United States.

She had initially planned to visit the country for three weeks, but after 12 days she posted online that she had to cut the trip short.

Her family, including her devastated husband Steven Sierra, have said she went to the country because of the photo opportunities. They say she used her iPad and iPhone to shoot the images.

Sierra's body was 
found stashed by Istanbul's ancient city walls on Saturday, more than a 
week after she failed to catch her flight home. Police said she died 
from a blunt force trauma.

Heading home: Sierra's casket is seen inside the Surp Yerrortutyun church in Istanbul, Turkey on Wednesday. Her body is expected to be sent back to the U.S. on Thursday

Journey: Authorities said the mother of two had died from a blunt force trauma to the head

She was found with a head wound and a blanket near her body. She was
wearing jeans, a jumper and a jacket, and still had her earrings and a 
bracelet on, but her iPhone and iPad were missing.

To pay for her funeral, her family began selling some of her images online on Tuesday and soon had enough to cover her expenses.

The photos remain on sale online and any other profits will go to her two young sons, who are nine and 11, her family wrote on the website.

Photographs on sale include images taken during her time in Istanbul and pictures of New York City. They are being sold as canvases, framed prints, greeting cards and iPhone cases for $39.95 each.

'Sarai's passion for photography and love for capturing the beauty we see in culture, architecture and scenery was her reason for traveling to Istanbul,' her brother, David Jimenez, wrote on the site.

He added this afternoon: 'Thank you 
for all the support in purchasing Sarai's pictures. Quick update, all 
expenses for Sarai's funeral have been paid for!

'From
here on out any picture of hers that you purchase will NOT be going 
towards her funeral. All funds will be going to her children. Thank you 
for your support. David.'

The outpouring of support comes hours
after Sierra's devastated husband, Steven, revealed how he is consumed 
with sadness at his wife's death.

Mr Sierra, 40, left their home in 
Staten Island for Istanbul last week to help search for his wife, after 
she failed to get on a flight back to the U.S. on January 21 - but the 
trip ended in heartbreak.

'I'm heartbroken,' Mr Sierra, who was married to Sarai for 14 years, told the New York Daily News, weeping. 'This is something you never want to imagine, and it's something I'd never want anyone to experience.

'You
have so many plans, so many dreams with the person you deeply love. You
look forward to many years together and there are so many things you 
haven’t fulfilled with that person, and now those won’t be fulfilled.'

His two sons, who are aged nine and 11, still do not know their mother 
is dead. Mr Sierra told the Daily News he is waiting until he returns 
home to tell the boys face-to-face.

Turkish police hope DNA samples from 21 people being questioned in the 
case will be key to finding the perpetrators, according to state run media.

Her mother told the Today show: 'It was such a shock when we heard. She was supposed to come back and she didn't.

'Her little boys do not know, their father will talk to them once he gets back. We will all be present for this.

'It was the first time she was going overseas after getting into 
photography college. She wanted to go there and take pictures of bridges and
the history of the city.'

Sierra had left for Istanbul on January 7 to explore her photography hobby, her family said.

She
was in regular contact with friends and relatives, and had told them 
she would visit Galata Bridge, which spans Istanbul's Golden Horn 
waterway, to take photos.

CBS News reported that shortly after 
Sierra's body was discovered, a woman came forward and told police she 
had seen a white car parked near the city walls as she was driving there
the night of January 29, Anadolu reported.

The eyewitness said a man was trying to remove 'something' from the car, at which point she caught a glimpse of a woman's hand.

The
news came after police in Istanbul detained and released a man who was
one of the last in contact with the missing mother, who vanished the 
same day she planned to meet up with him.

The man only identified as 'Taylan' on 
social media sites was taken into police custody after questioning on 
the disappearance of the woman.

Turkish news reports said Sierra had arranged to meet her contact, 'Taylan,' on Galata Bridge she wanted to photograph the day she went missing.

It was about a mile from Sierra's hostel, Dogan news agency reported but it's not known if the meeting had actually taken place.

'We
did not meet that day, but we had met before,' Taylan told police while
adding that it was four months ago that they met for the first time 
online, Turkish paper the daily Hürriyet reports.

Authorities scoured security 
camera images near to the bridge to see if the meeting did in fact take 
place, the news agency said.

Last images: Sarai Sierra, a New York mother missing in Turkey, is seen on CCTV before she disappeared

Last week, Turkish police released security camera footage showing the 
missing mother at a mall near her hostel hours before she disappeared.

Sierra can be seen eating lunch and walking through the mall on January 20 - a day before she was supposed to catch a flight back home.

Her family last heard from her on Jan. 21, when she was supposed to start her journey home, but she never checked into her flight.
