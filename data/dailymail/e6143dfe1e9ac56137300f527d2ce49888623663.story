Prince Harry proved once again that he's a royal action man when he got behind the wheel of a 4x4 and tackled a treacherous-looking assault course in Warwickshire yesterday.

The action was part of the opening event of the Invictus Games, the Jaguar Land Rover Driving Challenge, which was eventually won by Australia.

But before the competitors got going, Prince Harry, who later admitted that he's starting to feel old ahead of his 30th birthday, was driven around the track at breakneck speed, struggling up muddy hillocks and splashing through muddy pools.

Vrooooom! Prince Harry looked thrilled as he took a spin in a white F-Type Jaguar sports car in Warwickshire

Nice wheels! The prince appeared to enjoy his close encounter with the gleaming white F-Type Jaguar

Earlier, he had turned his hand to 
driving an altogether more sporty model in the shape of an F-Type Jaguar
 and appeared to enjoy the experience - beaming broadly as he slid into 
the driver's seat and sped off.

Afterwards, he stopped to watch the teams in action and was seen grimacing as competitors slid around in the mud and, at one point, hit a bump with a judder.

But he was all smiles when Team Australia took the first gold of the Invictus Games, smiling broadly as he presented Sarah Archibald and Matthew Taxis with their medals.

It was disappointment for Team GB however, after Germany's Engin Imprammpasi and Jorn Peper took silver and John de Ruiter and Wesley van den Wildenberg from the Netherlands took bronze.

Speaking during the presentation ceremony, Prince Harry revealed that the Invictus Games were 'probably' the way he would celebrate his 30th birthday and admitted that he is starting to feel old.

Asked about his upcoming birthday, he said: 'I’m slowly starting to feel old.' The royal also compared turning 30 to seeing a 30mph speed limit sign as you enter a village.

He added: 'I don’t feel too old, I think I am always young at heart. Surrounding myself with these guys and girls does keep me young. They’re sharp-witted and their sense of humour is on it.'

Harry, who has championed the games with the help of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, also said his position had helped make the inaugural event a popular one.

'I’m at the stage of my life now where over the last couple of years I have realised what a difference it can make,' he explained.

'Using the position to do good is something I have tried to do for many years of my life, but this is a classic example.'

Speaking to journalists at the end of his visit, Harry said he had been humbled by the experience, and everyone else should be too.

'I think everyone should be humbled. The reaction I have seen today for all the organising committee has reminded us exactly why we have done this,' he said.

'It’s a hugely humbling experience to see them go through the process, which I have been lucky enough to see.'

Asked whether some people might criticise that the Games could be seen as supporting war, Harry said: 'This is nothing to do with supporting war.

'The British public support the individuals. It’s about supporting these individuals who have signed up to serve their country and wherever it takes them.'

He said the fear that people might forget about the soldiers suffering the effects of conflicts when they stopped hitting the headlines 'should be a fear for everybody'.

'At the end of the day, the people who have given all their money, whether it is £5, £1 or £2,000, they have basically invested in a group of individuals, a group of people, because they want to help.This is the result.

'We are going to see lives that have been changed by the way they have been injured, and then changed by this.'

The driving challenge came after a day of 
engagements to welcome Invictus Games competitors to London and an 
unusually frank exchange with members of the media, to whom Harry 
revealed that his step further away from the throne was 'great'.

But a joyful Harry couldn't resist a joke at his brother's expense, quipping that he could not wait to see his older brother ‘suffer more’ by having to look after two children.

He also welcomed the possibility of William having a daughter, saying: ‘I’d love to see him try and cope with that!’

Harry also revealed more details about the Duchess of Cambridge's condition, saying Kate was ‘pretty poorly, but doing the best she can’.

Another member of the royal family to speak of his joy at the news was Mike Tindall, husband of Harry's cousin Zara Phillips, who revealed that he only heard the news on the radio.

The retired rugby star, 35, was appearing as a guest on radio station talkSPORT when the pregnancy was announced.
