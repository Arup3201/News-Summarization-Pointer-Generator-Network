They could reveal the secrets of Hollywood - and explain just why TV shows and films become hits.

A Northwestern University professor has plotted a series of graphs revealing some of Hollywood's scripting tricks.

They include leaving the phrase 'love you' until the last possible moment.

The analysis looked at key words and at what point in films and TV shows they were used

Love Actually: Keeping the use of the phrase 'love you' until later in a script is key, researchers say.

'What I've done is cut every script there into 'twelfths' of a movie or TV show; the charts here show the course of an episode or movie from the first minute at the left to the last one at the right,' explained Ben Schmidt, an assistant professor of history at Northeastern University on his blog. 

He found that almost all TV and film writers delays the use of 'I love you' until late in the plot. 

'For example: the phrase 'love you' (as in, mostly, 'I love you') is most frequent towards the end of movies or TV shows: characters in movies are almost three times more likely to profess their love in the last scene of a movie than in the first.'

Other words and phrases that are key include 'if you'.

'It's rare at the beginning of scripts, common in the middle, and then rare again towards the end,'says Schmidt.

The phrase 'if you' rarely appears early in a script - as it needs characters to build up to it

Schmidt analysed a whole series of words and phrases as part of the study, and found there were key patterns reveal throughout the plot.

He believes this is because it reveals a particular type of dialogue, in which the protagonist has to give or seek advice about the consequences of their actions. 

'First scenes won't have the necessary exposition laid out for the hero to reach a crossroads; and as the script wraps up in the third act, the importance of decisions fade out in favour of consequences.'

Schmidt analysed a whole series of words and phrases as part of the study, and found there were key patterns reveal throughout the plot.

For instance, he found over the course of a script, characters talk more about the truth and lying; they more often narrate murders; they use the language of apology and authenticity. (Two out of the nine topics display 'sorry' prominently.) 

'They talk less, on the other hand, about 'business' and 'companies,' about their 'job' and the 'office,' and about times of day.'
