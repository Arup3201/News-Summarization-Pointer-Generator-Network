A cash-strapped mother-of-four has revealed that she is planning to fund Christmas by selling her breast milk.

Rebecca Hudson, 26, from Manchester, appeared on This Morning and revealed that she has so far made £3,700.

The entrepreneurial mother came up with the idea after realising that she was producing more milk than her youngest child Milly, now one, needed.

Entrepreneurial: Rebecca Hudson, 26, from Manchester is selling her own breast milk

She sells the milk for £12.50 a bottle and has amassed a devoted group of eight clients, among them a bodybuilder.

The Manchester mother also admitted that some clients purchase the milk to use for 'sexual purposes'.

'What they do with the milk is up to them,' she said. 'I'm not going to discriminate. There's no difference for anyone who wants to use the milk, from a bodybuilder to someone who wants to use it sexually.'

She also used her appearance on the ITV flagship show to hit out at those who say drinking breast milk is revolting, saying that drinking the substance is completely 'natural'.

Not bothered: Ms Hudson says she has no problem with people using the milk for 'sexual purposes'

'Some think drinking breast milk is disgusting,' Ms Hudson explained. 'That's their problem. It's natural and full of vitamins.'

She also revealed how much she makes from her unusual business. 'For a 5oz bottle, I would make £12.50,' she told a clearly impressed Philip Schofield.

'So for a usual pop can, that would be £27.50. I've made over £3,000. The exact figure is around £3,700 or something.'

Ms Hudson isn't the first person to make a profit from breast milk. Mommy Milk Creations was set up by mother-of-three Allicia Mogavero earlier this year and uses the substance to make jewellery.

Each piece is made by hand and takes up to five hours to create. Ms Mogavero then sells the jewels for $160 (£97) each.

So popular has the company become, Ms Mogavero has a 12-month waiting list. Mothers can also pay to have their own breast milk used in the jewellery.
