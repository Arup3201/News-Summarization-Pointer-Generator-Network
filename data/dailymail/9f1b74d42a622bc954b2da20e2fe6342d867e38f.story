Widow Randi Lane, 69, was fleeced out of £20,000 of her life savings by a string of mail scams

A grandmother told how she was fleeced out of £20,000 of her life savings by a string of mail scams.

Widow Randi Lane's name was found on a 'sucker list' used by fraudsters after a raid on a distribution house from where the letters are sent.

But before the discovery she had lost tens of thousands of pounds replying to scam letters from lotteries and so-called clairvoyants.

The trusting grandmother-of-two said she feels like she has been taken for a fool by the 'terrible' scammers who have deliberately targeted her with up to 20 letters a day.

The former nanny, 69, said: 'I must have spent thousands of pounds - it was money I was saving for holidays and for my grandchildren.

'I would have loved to travel or go on a cruise - but because of these scammers I haven't been able to do any of that.

'The letters are so cleverly worded and addressed directly to you. They are so believable.

'They obviously think I am an easy target and used that to their advantage, and then they tell others and they send letters too.

'I have always thought of myself as a business minded person, as I have worked all of my life, and I have never thought of myself as stupid but I must have been to fall for it.'

Mrs Lane - who moved to England from Norway almost 50 years ago - began receiving the abundance of mail when she moved into her current home St Annes, Lancashire, in 2006.

And over the nine years since she has forked out as much as £20,000 - paying between £20 and £40 a time to supposed mediums and lottery schemes promising prizes of millions of pounds.

 Mrs Lane's was one of dozens of names found on a 'suckers list' when the National Scam Hub raided a distribution house from where scam mail would be sent.

Trading Standards bosses said the case was an example of con artists using cleverly-worded letters to groom people into handing over their hard-earned cash. 

The widow, whose name was found on a suckers list, receives up to 20 scam letters each day 

A spokesperson from Trading Standards said: 'Mrs Lane was highlighted to us as being on what they call a 'sucker list'.

'Unfortunately, particularly with elderly, vulnerable people they can be taken in and it can open up the flood gates.

'These people are effectively groomed. A more sinister development is a clairvoyant saying they can see a big money win. Surprise, surprise, the victim then gets a letter from the lottery.

'And they personalise letters using their first names - it's a very vindictive way of earning a living.'

The 69-year-old used to reply to every letter she received but after being contacted by Trading Standards she has stopped this

But despite stopping replying to the letters last year, the grandmother still gets up to half a dozen letters every day as well as several phone calls.

She said: 'These people normally target people who are elderly or alone or don't get out much. They take advantage of vulnerable people - it is terrible.

'But if I can stop just one person from doing what I have done, and stop more people from being hoodwinked, I am willing to share my story.'
