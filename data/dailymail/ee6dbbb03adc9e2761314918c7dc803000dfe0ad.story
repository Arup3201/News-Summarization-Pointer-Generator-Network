Most people were shocked while reading EL James' raunchy mummy porn trilogy Fifty Shades Of Grey at the idea that a man might have a contractual sexual relationship with a woman.

But now one real-life Christian Grey has come forward to explain why he ritualistically enters into precisely this sort of 'arrangement'.

Dexter Koh, a 30-year-old businessman from Shoreditch in east London, boasts a six-figure salary and a penchant for providing the women he dates with the finest things in life...in return for sex.

Koh, who runs a PR company, has been finding female students on a 'sugar daddy' dating website since he was 28, with whom he enters into 'mutually beneficial arrangements'

Koh sees similarities between himself and Grey, the protagonist of the Fifty series which details the S&M relationship between Christian Grey and student Anastasia Steele.

He admits he enjoys the comparisons with Grey - also a successful businessman who insists upon having contracts with the women he dates - saying: 'Half the women in the world are infatuated with Christian Grey.

'Yes,
 he has his dark side, but what single guy in his thirties wouldn't want 
beautiful young students throwing themselves at him?'

Koh, who runs a PR company, has been finding female students on a 'sugar daddy' dating website since he was 28, with whom he enters into 'mutually beneficial arrangements'.

These are contracts between him and the girls where, according to a spokesman for the site, 'they give him sex and show him a good time, and he lavishes them with riches'.

One of the first students Koh dated on the site was Melissa, a 21-year-old studying languages at Oxford University.

He said: 'We hit it off straight away by email and quickly arranged to meet at a pub in Woodstock near Oxford.

The average British sugar daddy earns £170,000 a year and spends £1,500 a month on girls he meets

'She was blonde, tall, sophisticated and very well-read and travelled - she was everything I look for in a woman. We entered into a mutually beneficial arrangement.

'I was paying her around £1,000 a month - sometimes more depending on how often we'd see each other.

'We'd go away for weekends -Paris, Berlin, Milan. We'd stay somewhere nice, have great sex and just enjoy each other's company. At some point we'd always go shopping and I'd treat her - shoes, dresses, you name it. The best designer labels.

'The sex was fantastic. The Fifty Shades of Grey books are pretty dark. We'd indulge in a bit of role play but nothing as sinister as Christian and Ana - we'd just have fun.'

Koh said said the arrangement worked for both of them: 'Melissa got help with her student fees and I'd got a beautiful young girlfriend.

'I treated her in just the same way as I would if we had met in the bar - but this way you can establish that arrangement a little quicker than you would ordinarily. You are both aware of what is expected of you right from the beginning.

'Neither of us wanted anything heavy - and we parted amicably after a couple of months.'

By then Koh had met Jane, a 
22-year-old studying fashion in London. He said: 'She had very expensive
 tastes so we went shopping a lot.

'She
 had joined the site because she wanted to live the life of a celebrity 
but on student money. She was very sexy and loved to be dominated.'

Koh also dated a recent graduate from Bristol University he met on the site, Seeking Arrangement.

Polly, 24, had student debts of £62,000 and was living in London trying to get a job in television. Kor said: 'There was no way she could have survived financially without the help of a sugar daddy.

'I really felt sorry for her - she was worried sick about her debt.

'I really don't know how some students cope without having very rich parents.

'I admired Polly because she was determined to make it in TV and was basically working as in intern for no money.

'She had dated several sugar daddies before me.

'She was totally unapologetic about it and admitted that once she had got her career and her finances sorted she would quit the site.'
