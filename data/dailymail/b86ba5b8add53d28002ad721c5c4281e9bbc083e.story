The gap between house prices in London and the north-east of England is the widest it has ever been, official figures show.

Property now costs three-and-a-half times more in the capital than it does in the north-east, according to the Office for National Statistics.

This compares to two-and-a-half times more four years ago.

Experts said it was a clear indication that the north-south divide is a prevalent as ever.

The average house in London now costs an average £514,000, compared to £154,000 almost 300 miles further north.

Prices grew by almost 20 per cent this year in the capital, compared to less than four per cent in the north-east.

David Newnes, director of Reeds Rains and Your Move estate agents, said: ‘A north/south divide in the field remains evident in the race back from the debris of the financial crash.’

The average house price in the UK was £274,000 in August, according to the ONS, a record high after rising almost 12 per cent this year.

A first-time buyer typically now has to pay £210,000 for a starter home.

Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said despite the ‘robust’ price rises, growth was likely to become more restrained this winter.

Toughened lending rules came into force in April under the Mortgage Market Review (MMR), which forced lenders to grill mortgage applicants about their spending habits to ensure they could afford their repayments. This had a dampening effect on the market.

Dr Archer said buyer interest would also be ‘constrained’ as prices in parts of the UK became unaffordable, amid low wage growth. 

Regardless of where you live, potential buyers are enjoying record-breaking mortgage rates.

But, unless you do your research, it's likely you'll be lumped with a poor interest deal, which could substantially add to your monthly payments.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of options out there that will make buying a home as affordable as possible. So, as well as doing your own research, this is an occasion to search out expert opinion from a good mortgage broker. 

First, read Mail Online's award-winning money section This is Money's regularly updated What next for mortgage rates? This outlines the current state of the market and highlights the current best buy deals.

Then also check the top mortgage deals on offer currently in our best buy mortgage tables, or click through by using our helpful table (right).

You should now be armed with some knowledge about what is on offer and you can use our True cost mortgage calculator to compare how different deals stack up.

You should also talk to a mortgage broker. There is no obligation to go through with their recommendation and so they may not end up actually arranging the mortgage for you, but they will be able to explain your options and help you to find the best deal.

Go a broker who offers advice from the whole market. Avoid brokers who offer a restricted service based on products from a limited number of lenders, and don't just simply go to your bank - unless you get lucky, you will be unlikely to find the best deal this way

This is Money has a carefully chosen partnership with mortgage broker London and Country. We have picked them because they offer a good service, with no upfront fees. Find about more about London & Country's fee free mortgage advice here.
