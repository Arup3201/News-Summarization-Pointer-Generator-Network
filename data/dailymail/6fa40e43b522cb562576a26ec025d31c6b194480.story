Mayor Bloomberg has painted an unsettling picture for New Yorkers, one where Hurricane Sandy was just a paltry beginning of what could be a city increasingly devastated by the effects of global warming.

Following some startling figures released by city officials—that, for instance, by the 2050s, 800,000 people could be living in a flood zone that would cover a quarter of the land, with temperatures steadily rising—Bloomberg spoke Tuesday on the risks to New York City from future storms like Sandy.

The mayor also took such discussions a step further by meeting, head on, the problem of a rapidly changing environment in New York City as a whole.

Even worse: Hurricane Sandy, which caused the biggest storm surge ever in NYC, was likely just the start of major and widespread climate change affects on New York according to fresh New York City and FEMA data

And with projections that local waters could within decades be a foot to 2.5 feet higher than they are today, which would leave 8 percent of the city's coastline flooding just from high tides, the mayor’s decision to speak out on the issue comes as no surprise.

'Piece by piece, over many years and even decades, we can build a city that's capable of preparing better, withstanding more and overcoming anything,' he said.

Among Bloomberg's suggestions were for removable flood walls to be set up for much of lower Manhattan, a 15-to-20-foot levee to guard part of Staten Island, and a system of gates and levees to protect a Brooklyn creek.

'This plan is incredibly ambitious,' Bloomberg said of his proposed $20 billion plan. 'This is urgent work, and it must begin now.'

Under water: Hurricane Sandy caused massive flooding in the New York area. New studies say to expect a lot more in the coming decades. Bloomberg has proposed a $20 plan to stem such disaster

Scary possibilities: Rising sea levels could push storm surges like the unprecedented one seen by Hurricane Sandy even higher. A map indicates the lower lying areas into which rising tides would flow. Bloomberg wants to build infrastructure to stop it

The recommendations drew from updated predictions from the New York City Panel on Climate Change, a scientists' group convened by the city.

Updated numbers from 2009 data, which themselves looked grim, show equally shocking outcomes from climate change in New York...but the changes will come even sooner.

By 2050, New Yorkers could expect:

Coastal water levels up to 1 to 2.5 feet higher.

Which means 8 percent of the coastline could be flooded just from high tide.

And 800,000 people could live within a 100-year-floodplain.

The average day could be 4 to 7 degrees hotter.

The temperature could be at or over 90 degrees Fahrenheit for some 57 days a year.

The average day could be 4 degrees to nearly 7 degrees Fahrenheit hotter by mid-century, the panel estimates in data Pinsky and Holloway discussed Monday. A once-in-a-century storm would likely spur a surge 5 feet or more higher than did Sandy, which sent a record 14-foot storm tide gushing into lower Manhattan. 

City Hall, the state government and others have released warnings over the years about climate risks. The city has required some new developments in flood zones to be elevated and has restored wetlands as natural barriers, among other steps.

‘Sandy, obviously, increased the urgency of dealing with this and the need to plan and start to take concrete steps,’ Holloway said. 

The new projections echo 2009 estimates from the climate change panel, but the timeframe for some upper-end possibilities has moved up from the 2080s to mid-century.

Soaked: Low-lying areas were especially hard hit by Sandy. City officials have now released data that such areas--up to 8 percent of the city--could be flooded just at high tide by 2050

Preparation: 'Piece by piece, over many years and even decades, we can build a city that's capable of preparing better, withstanding more and overcoming anything,' said Mayor Bloomberg June 11

‘The overall numbers are similar, but
we have more compelling evidence now that (a more severe scenario from 
2009) is looking like a more realistic possibility now,’ due to improved
computer models and more evidence that some ice sheets are melting, 
said Radley Horton, a climate scientist with Columbia University's Earth Institute and a researcher with the city climate panel. 

Meanwhile, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency released revisions Monday to proposed new flood zone 
maps for the city. About 218,000 people and 35,000 buildings are in the 
current once-in-100-year flood zone, drawn in the 1980s.

Sooner than later: Bloomberg tours storm-ravaged Queens. The administration is now addressing fears of future vulnerabilities from storms and other weather due to newer, scarier climate change data

The new maps roughly double those numbers, though the revision shifts about 5,800 structures from a subset called the V zone - the area expected to suffer the worst damage - to a less stringent zone.

A roughly two-year review is expected before new maps become official.

Scientists have reached a consensus on global warming but still debate how severe the effects will be.
