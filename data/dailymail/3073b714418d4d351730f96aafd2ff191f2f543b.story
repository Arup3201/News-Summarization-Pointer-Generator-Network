A 31-year-old Chicago man has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend, allegedly strangling her to death during a late-night fight on Tuesday.

Daniel Kralik is being held on a $1 million bond in the relation to the slaying of Victoria McManus, 26, who he had been dating for two years.

The couple had been living together for the past two months at her home in the 1200 block of North Rockwell Street, Assistant State’s Attorney Alexandra Molesky told The Chicago Sun-Times.

Two weeks ago, the couple got into a fight because McManus, 26, had a relationship with another man, Molesky said.

Confessed: Daniel Kralik called 911 and admitted that he had strangled Victoria McManus after an argument at the apartment they shared in Chicago on Tuesday night

Kralik initially planned to move out and stay with friends, but the couple reconciled and continued living together.

On Tuesday, the couple got into another fight at McManus’ apartment, authorities said.

McManus left her residence while Kralik went to a friend’s place until he 'cooled off', Molesky said.

Instead, Kralik stayed at McManus’ apartment and when she returned home the couple got into another argument in her bedroom, Molesky said.

During the argument, Kralik allegedly strangled McManus with his hands.

The roommate heard the muffled sounds of an argument and a brief struggle, Molesky said.

Kralik called 911 and admitted that he strangled McManus after an argument.

Police responded about 12:50 a.m. and arrested Kralik, authorities said.

McManus was declared dead at the scene.

McManus was found lying on her bed with an abrasion on her forehead and a pillow covering her face, Molesky said.

An autopsy confirmed McManus died of strangulation, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office.

Kralik appeared in court wearing Thursday a white plastic jumpsuit because his clothes were taken as evidence.

Judge Adam Bourgeois ordered Kralik held on $1 million bond and issued a next court date of June 4.

Kralik, whose parents live in Montana, had been working at an aquarium and fish store and has no criminal history, his public defender said.

Police listed his address as the 2200 block of West Iowa Street.
