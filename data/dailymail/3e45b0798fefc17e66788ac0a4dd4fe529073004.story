They say office romances are best avoided, but for one couple, love blossomed as they were hard at work. In their case, work involved staring deep into each others' eyes while posing as newly-wed husband and wife.

The model pair - she wearing a flowing lacy white dress and he in smart black tie - got up close and personal for a wedding-themed shoot and are now tying the knot in real life.

Former Miss Birmingham Kris'ina Jagpal of Edgbaston is set to marry ex-Mr Birmingham Eli Coley, from Wolverhampton.

Life imitating art: Two beauty pageant winners are set to marry - after falling for each other on a wedding themed photo shoot. Krisina Jagpal, 26, and Eli Coley, 28, met after being crowned Mr and Miss Birmingham - and started dating shortly after their win

Eli, 28, won Mr Birmingham in 2011, while 26-year-old Krisina was crowned Miss Birmingham in 2012 - less than a year after she was diagnosed with bowel cancer.

Kris'ina from Edgbaston was in remission
 from cancer when she won the 2012 contest after entering in a bid to 
boost her confidence.

'I know it sounds cheesy but it was love at first sight,' she said of her first meeting with the man who is now her fiancee. 'I think we knew we wanted to wed on our first date. We fell in love on day one and each day feels like the first time.' 

The couple were already friendly through their modelling work but got together when they were paired up as Mr and Miss Birmingham by their shared talent agency two years ago.

At least they've had some practise! Kris'ina Jagpal is set to marry ex-Mr Birmingham Eli Coley after romance bloomed as they banged the drum for the city

Winning: Eli, 28, won Mr Birmingham in 2011 while 26-year-old Krisina was crowned Miss Birmingham in 2012

Work together, play together: They  knew they wanted to wed on their first date. 'We fell in love on day one and each day feels like the first time,' they said

She said: 'I have modelled with Eli in wedding shoots, which is ironic as we now plan to marry.'

Eli, aged 28, from Wolverhampton, said: 'It is wonderful to spend so much time at work with the woman you love. We are very lucky.

'We have 
not set a date yet but marriage is on the horizon and I am so looking 
forward to spending the rest of my life with Kris'ina.

Working hard: Business will come before pleasure for Kris'ina tonight as she hopes to win back her Miss Birmingham crown

'Marriage is something special to us both. We are best friends but also each other's motivation and strength.'

But business will come before pleasure for Kris'ina tonight as she hopes to win back her Miss Birmingham crown.

She
 said: 'It was a tremendous honour to represent my home city of
