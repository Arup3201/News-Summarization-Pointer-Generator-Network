Tourism is worth billions of pounds to the Caribbean every year but after 2010's devastating earthquake and years of escalating crime, Haiti has been left behind.

Now the government is attempting to rebuild the country by redeveloping the once buoyant tourism industry.

The Dominican Republic, which shares an island with Haiti, attracted 1.7million visitors in the first four months of this year alone.

Tourist push: Haiti's Club Indigo beach resort is relatively empty in peak times but the government is hoping it can emulate its Caribbean neighbours by attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors a year

Packed: Haiti wants to build its economy on tourism, like the Dominican Republic, which attracted 1.7million visitors in the first four months of this year alone

Haitians hope jobs will be creating by emulating their neighbour and growing the economy on the back of its paradise beaches and weather.

However, critics of the policy say it is moving too fast when much of the country is still lacking basics during as paved roads, drinking water and reliable electricity.

Crime, health scares, hurricanes and 
the monster earthquake of January 2010 have badly damaged the tourism 
that was once a mainstay of the Haitian economy, attracting the likes of
Mick Jagger and Jackie Onassis.

The Government is hoping a Venezuelan-financed $13.2million (£8.7million) airport
and new infrastructure on the southern island of Ile-a-Vache, and an $8million (£5.3million) development of the historic coastal town of Jacmel will help reverse the trend.

However, it is a big challenge. The Club Indigo beach resort north of the Haiti capital Port-au-Prince is crowded with U.N. peacekeepers, aid workers, diplomats and missionaries, rather than tourists.

Officials say the tourism push will 
create more than 1,600 direct jobs and 6,500 indirect jobs. Tourism 
generated $200million last year, Tourism Minister Stephanie Villedrouin said. The country's entire budget is $3billion.

Haiti was once a haunt of the rich and famous who came in search of late-night Voodoo ceremonies and rum-fueled revelry.

But an AIDS scare in the early 1980s sent the tourists packing, and years of political instability continued to keep them away.

Officials say the 2010 earthquake killed 316,000 people, and a cholera outbreak nine months later took more than 7,750 lives.

Today, the only mass tourism - 600,000 a 
year, according to Villedrouin - comes from cruise ships stopping at 
Labadie on the north coast where passengers can frolic for a few hours 
in a fenced-in resort.

Sen. Francois Anick Joseph said: 'There are a lot of things that need to be done before we can attract 
tourists," he said in a telephone interview.'

But steps are being made. The Tourism Ministry's budget has more than doubled.

Under the previous government it was $2million (£1.3million) plus a $1million (£670,000) loan from Venezuela's PetroCaribe oil fund.

Now it's $4.7million (£3.1million), and Petrocaribe is paying $27million (£18million) to finance development on projects that include Ile-a-Vache and in Jacmel.

It says it has signed off on 15-year tax breaks and exemptions from import duties for 11 hotel and resort projects costing a total of $160million (£107million), with nearly $100million (67million) more in the pipeline or completed.

It is also training a force of 53 
'tourism police officers' who will learn Spanish and English and be 
trained in first aid and customer service.

Devastation: More than 300,000 people died in the 2010 earthquake that flattened whole neighbourhoods

Too soon? Critics say the government should ensure there are countrywide pavements and clean water first

While many in Haiti welcome anything that can create jobs, some worry that the country isn't ready for a tourist invasion.

The Tourism Ministry says it has only
3,200 hotel rooms and U.S. and Canadian travel advisories say medical 
services are woefully lacking.

The UK's Foreign Office advises against all travel to the country's slum districts and advises caution in visits to other parts of Haiti.

The government hopes to double the number of hotel rooms in two years. But the critics say Haiti first has to improve its infrastructure.

Tourism Minister Stephanie Villedrouin says Haiti has to stand on its own feet.

'If we want to be a sovereign country, if we don't want to depend on other countries, we need to figure out ourselves how to move forward and how to get revenue, and tourism must be no.1 on the list,' she said. 

Each hotel room built creates two jobs and four indirect jobs, she said.

Last year the U.S. State Department designated Haiti a 'major drug trafficking country.'

Meanwhile, the country faces tough competition from Caribbean neighbours offering cheaper holiday deals.

Air Transat, a Canadian charter carrier, flies weekly between Montreal and Port-au-Prince, and says it has brought in 120 tourists this year on holiday packages in Haiti costing $1,399 to $1,600.
