A man, 27, suffered serious leg and pelvis injuries after being crushed by a 30-ton boulder during a rockslide in northern Arizona yesterday.

The Phoenix man was trying to move a boulder that had fallen onto Mount Elden Lookout Rd when a massive rock came crashing down on top of him about 7.20am.

He was heading up Mount Elden, in Flagstaff, with four colleagues to work on one of the radio towers when he was pinned under the falling rock.

Tragic: A Phoenix man, 27, suffered serious leg and pelvis injuries after being crushed by a 30-ton boulder during a rockslide in northern Arizona on Tuesday morning

Tough terrain: Rescuers could only reach the isolated road in a 4WD, before driving the victim down the mountain to a waiting ambulance

The man's colleagues were able to drag his injured body out from under the enormous boulder after calling emergency services. 

The group was about 3.3 miles up the mountain when they were caught in the rockslide, caused by recent heavy rains.

Coconino County Sheriff's Office spokesman Gerry Blair told Eyewitness News 3 an ambulance, fire truck and medical helicopter couldn't reach the victim because of poor and unsafe conditions.

Rescuers reached the man in a sheriff's office SUV, before transferring him to an ambulance waiting at the bottom of the mountain. He was taken to Flagstaff Medical Center with severe pelvis and leg injuries.

Azdailysun reports The Coconino National Forest has closed Elden Lookout Road and may be temporarily closing other trails and areas affected by the recent rains.

According to Forest Service officials, rain has also caused falling boulders, rockslides, washouts and debris in other areas, leading to the closure of numerous roads.
