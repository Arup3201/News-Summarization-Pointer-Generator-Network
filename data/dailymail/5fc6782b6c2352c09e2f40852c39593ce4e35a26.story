A helicopter pilot is dead after he walked into the aircraft's spinning rotor while giving rides at a Pennsylvania fair.

Carl Enlow, 69, was killed when he was hit by the rotor on Friday night at the Bloomsburg Fair.

The fair's superintendent of police and parking Bill Barratt said the helicopter was refueling when Enlow went back to speak to the pilot who relieved him. Barrett said Enlow's hat blew off his head and he was struck by the rotor when he reached for it.

'He went back to talk to the other pilot, and that's when the rotor struck him,' he said.

Enlow of Reading was transported by Life Flight to Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, where he died.

Barratt said Enlow was an experienced pilot, having flown helicopters for 50 years including in the military.

'That just goes to prove that anything can happen,' Barratt told PA Homepage.

Dawn Kingston of Bloomsburg told the news website that Enlow was a well-known fixture at the fair, having taken rides for many years.

'I'm sure that a lot of people who return to the fair probably know him,' she said.

She said Enlow enjoyed helping other people and last year he fulfilled the dying wish of a six-year-old Hazleton girl battling cancer by taking her on a flight.

'He was a very sweet man with a heart of gold, and we really appreciated everything he did,' she said.

Heritage Rotors has been giving helicopter rides since 1993 and is a popular attraction at the fair.

The Bloomsburg Fair Association is returning its profits from the helicopter rides to Enlow's widow, Connie Enlow. He is also survived by two siblings.

'The fair board is going to do whatever we can to help her with whatever she needs,' said Barratt.

Montour County Coroner Scott Lynn told the Bloomsburg Press-Enterprise the Birdsboro man's death is under investigation.
