Raking it in: Even after having his salary slashed by 36%, Lee Hsien Loong will still earn $1.7m a year

Singapore's Prime Minister has reacted to public anger over income inequality by taking a 36 per cent pay cut - but is still one of the world's best paid political leaders.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has had his salary reduced by over a third after public fury over soaring housing costs and increased pay inequality.

The Singapore leader is still earning $1.7million a year (£1.089m) as the world's best paid leader however, over four times the salary of U.S. president Barack Obama.

The U.S. president, leader of a 
country of 312million people in comparison to Singapore's 5.1million, 
earns around $400,000 (£256,000).

And
 the pay packet of the Singapore leader dwarfs that of British Prime 
Minister David Cameron, who earns $222,000 a year (£142,000).

The move in Singapore came after Prime Minister Lee said today he will accept the recommendations of a government-appointed committee to reduce his salary, as well as those of his ministers and the city-state's president.

The committee - appointed by Lee following a disastrous parliamentary election in which his party faced historic losses - recommended that Lee's salary be cut 36 percent to 2.2 million Singapore dollars ($1.7 million). 

Prime Minister Lee's salary is four times that of Barack Obama and eight times that of David Cameron

Lee has served as Prime Minister of the prosperous city-state since 2004.

President Tony Tan faces even tougher times, with a potentially staggering 51 percent salary cut. Still, observers might consider him well-paid at SG$1.5 million for a ceremonial post.

Salaries for government ministers will be reduced by 37 percent to an annual SG$1.1 million.

Prime Minister Lee's wage is comfortably bigger than that of any other world leader.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy collects $302,000 (£193,000) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel earns $296,000 (£189,000).

Gerard Ee, chairman of the remuneration committee, said parliament will debate the recommendations later this month. However, Lee, in a letter to the committee, said he will accept the new salaries.

Lee's ruling People's Action Party won parliamentary elections in May, with its lowest overall vote total since independence in 1965.

The salaries of Singapore's leaders soared in the 1990s when they were benchmarked to an average of the highest private sector pay in Singapore.

Singapore's leaders had long justified their high salaries by insisting they were necessary to attract the best managerial and leadership talent to public service.
