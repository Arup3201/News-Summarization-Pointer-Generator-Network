West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has issued a hands-off warning over winger Matt Jarvis.

The 28-year-old has failed to live up to his £10.75million price-tag since Allardyce bought him from Wolves in 2012, a club record at the time.

It is understood West Bromwich Albion are interested in signing Jarvis and are poised to tempt West Ham with an offer.

But Allardyce said bluntly: 'Matt Jarvis will not be leaving us.'

Jarvis earned an England call-up in 2011 for his displays for Wolves when they were in the Barclays Premier League, but has not reached those heights since.

The five-year contract Jarvis signed when he joined the club is set to run until 2017 and Allardyce is confident the player still has value to his side. 

But his resolve could be severely tested with West Brom considering making an offer of around £7.25m.
