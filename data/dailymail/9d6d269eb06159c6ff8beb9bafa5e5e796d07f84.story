A mysterious blood-thirsty wild cat is feared to have struck again after three wallabies were found devoured on farmland.

The trio were found stripped to the bone, with their internal organs neatly placed beside their bodies.

Examinations
revealed they had suffered puncture wounds to the neck - consistent 
with a vicious attack by a panther-like creature.

Devoured: The remains of one of the wallabies which is believed to have been killed by the Wildcat of Woodchester, which is feared to have killed three deer earlier this month

Experts now believe the animals were devoured by the Wildcat of Woodchester which is already believed to have killed three times this month.

The 
mutilated bodies of three deer have been found in the past few weeks in 
countryside near Stroud, Gloucestershire -  just 12 miles from where the wallabies were mauled to death.

The wallabies were found only 12 miles apart leading to the belief that it was the same cat

Samples of DNA  from the 
predator's first deer kill on January 4 are currently being tested to 
confirm whether or not a big cat is behind the killings.

The results are expected to be revealed over the next few days.

But big cat expert Frank Tunbridge is in no doubt over who killed the wallabies and the deer.

Mr Tunbridge, 65, said: 'There could be no creature other than a big cat that could bring down and kill these wallabies.

'The field was surrounded by a 7ft fence and there was no apparent entry signs - so the predator must have leapt over it.

'The
killer struck over two nights. The first night he killed two wallabies,
stripped one of the carcasses down and hid the other under a pile of 
leaves and straw.

'Then he came back and killed a third - devouring his further kills. A fourth wallaby appears to have died from a heart attack.

'The wallabies are only about 12 miles from Woodchester so it appears that this could be the same big cat.

'They have all the hallmarks of a panther or puma kill.'

The wallabies, part of a private collection, were found by their devastated owner on January 6 - two days after the apparent first kill by the Wildcat of Woodchester.

The Gloucestershire farmer did not want to divulge his name or location.

Examination: A man completes a DNA test on the carcass of one of the deer killed earlier this month which will confirm whether or not a big cat was responsible

But he did release gory pictures of one of the dead wallabies.

The carcass had been ripped open in a similar way to the three roe deers the beast is believed to have slayed.

The first deer had been torn open and was missing its heart, kidneys and liver.

Its snout was also missing - important because big cats clamp their jaws over the mouth, causing death by suffocation.

Experts believe the deer was brought down and devoured by a large and powerful predator such as a puma, jaguar or leopard.

Tufts of the animal’s fur were also found piled by the body - and such predators neatly pluck the hair from the body before shearing their teeth into the flesh.

Tests: This roe deer was killed less than 12 miles from where the big cat is feared to have devoured three wallabies

Another deer carcass was found by a dog walker between Whiteway and Redcomb, near Cirencester - ten miles away - on January 10.

A third roe deer body was found at a development in Cooper’s Edge, near Gloucester, days later.

Dr Robin Allaby, an expert in evolutionary genetics at Warwick University’s School of Life Sciences, is studying samples of DNA taken from the first carcass.

He said: 'I’m prepared to believe in the existence of big cats in the UK and we have a reasonable chance of finding out if it was there.

'We are in the process of studying samples of DNA taken from the deer and if its death was the result of a big cat then we’re hoping it left cheek cells and saliva.'
