There are some results that you look at on paper and they are decent enough. A draw at Manchester City, a point at Manchester United and a 1-1 at Southampton, given their fine run under Ronald Koeman, are decent returns for a club with Chelsea’s ambitions.

Defeat at White Hart Lane, when they were fully aware Manchester City had just beaten Sunderland at the Etihad, is not.

This, it has to be said, was an absolute mauling.

Jose Mourinho fumes as his Chelsea side slip to a 5-3 defeat at Tottenham on New Year's Day

Tottenham’s bracing victory here will be remembered as the day the Barclays Premier League title swung back in favour of the defending champions. The quicker we cut to the chase of January 31, when Chelsea play Manuel Pellegrini’s team at Stamford Bridge, the better.

Here at White Hart Lane we were supposed to witness the great recovery, the Chelsea backlash after the perceived injustice at St Mary’s last Sunday.

Instead they are searching for answers to their increasingly perplexing form on the road after this defeat against Mauricio Pochettino’s improving Spurs side.

This dodgy little run of Chelsea’s began on November 29 when they drew at Sunderland and were then beaten at Newcastle on December 6.

John Terry looks dejected after Chelsea concede their fourth goal at White Hart Lane

Here at White Hart Lane, just moments after Andros Townsend’s penalty had rippled the back of Thibaut Courtois’ net, Jose Mourinho was heading for the tunnel.

It is usually in these situations when he takes a moment to himself, deconstructing his team’s performance before the grand, half-time speech to the players in the dressing room.

He was entitled to be upset here, frustrated that his team allowed a one goal advantage to slide to such an extent that they were out of this game by half-time. By the 52nd minute, when Harry Kane scored his second of the game, it was all over.

So what has happened to them? At Stoke on December 22 they scored early as well, earning three points after John Terry put them in front and Cesc Fabregas added the second. At the time their spirit looked unbreakable.

It was a different story at Southampton, where Mourinho showed his ruthless streak by taking off Andre Schurrle at half-time as punishment for a poor performance.

At White Hart Lane there was no sign of the German World Cup winner, not even making the bench after that 1-1 draw at St Mary’s.

This time it was Oscar who made way, dragged off at the break and replaced by the muscular presence of Ramires. It made no difference.

Despite Mourinho’s brilliance as a coach, he always has the potential to combust.

The manner and the execution of the criticism levelled at referee Anthony Taylor was unnecessary, even if he failed to award Cesc Fabregas a 55th minute penalty.

Although Mourinho had a point, it has distracted this Chelsea team from the main event.

He lost it again here, repeatedly saying cursing at fourth official Andre Marriner when he felt decisions were going against this Chelsea team.

Referee Phil Dowd had it in the neck too, berated form the sidelines as Mourinho grew increasingly animated in the technical area.

Chelsea’s manager has to sort this out because he, just like his defence, is in danger of losing his cool. John Terry, who has been so reliable this season, and Gary Cahill are suddenly creaking as a central defensive partnership.

Terry’s unusual mistake at Southampton, which led to the opening goal from Sadio Mane. This was another chasing.

Harry Kane was magnificent, scoring twice and winning the penalty that put Tottenham 3-1 in the clear by half time.

When the young England forward hit the target in the 52nd minute, you just knew it was going to be Tottenham’s day.
