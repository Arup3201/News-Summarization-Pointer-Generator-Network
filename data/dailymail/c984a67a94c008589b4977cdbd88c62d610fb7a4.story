Daniel Coriat has been sent to a secure mental ward indefinitely after admitting killing and beheading his elderly mother at the flat they shared in Forrest Hill, south London

A paranoid schizophrenic who killed and decapitated his elderly mother because he believed she was a witch will spend the rest of his life in a secure mental ward.

Daniel Coriat, 44, was seen wandering the streets naked like 'a zombie' before police found him hiding in a wheelie bin in a train station following the murder.

He told officers he was the son of God and had been living in the bin since he 'came down from the sky two months ago', the Old Bailey heard today.

He made 'Hannibal Lecter suckling noises' before snarling at officers as he was arrested and put into a police van.

Emergency services found his mother Elizabeth,76, brutally murdered at the flat they shared together in Forest Hill, south London, in March last year.

She had suffered almost 50 separate injuries and her head had been cut off completely off, rotated 180 degrees, and placed back on her body.

‘His mother was found on her bed, 
fully clothed, decapitated and mutilated with various weapons embedded 
in her head and body,’ said prosecutor Sarah Plaschkes QC.

‘There were injuries to the wrists and ankles, suggesting a crucifixion-like pattern.’

Coriat was due to stand trial for the murder of his mother Elizabeth, 76, but prosecutors accepted a guilty plea to manslaughter today.

Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at the age of 18, he would often fly into explosive rages when he stopped taking his medication, the court heard.

He mutilated his mother’s body with an arsenal of weapons including carving knives, secateurs, a chef’s steel and a pruning saw.

Neighbours saw him walking naked and around near his flat and described the property having fallen eerily silent.

One said: ‘He had a blank vacant stare. He was walking really slowly like a zombie, staring straight ahead.’

A judge at the Old Bailey has sentenced Daniel Coriat to stay in a secure mental ward indefinitely after he admitted killing his mother Elizabeth

During an earlier court hearing, he claimed his mother was a witch, adding: ‘You saw the body when it was taken away. It didn’t look human.’

Flanked by psychiatric nurses, Coriat laughed loudly in the dock as a judge ordered he be locked away in a mental hospital indefinitely.

Judge Richard Hone QC told him: ‘I have come to the clear conclusion your mental illness is the primary component of this terrible offence.

‘My task is to ensure the public is safeguarded as far as possible from any recurrence of this bizarre, grisly and grotesque violence.’

Addressing the Coriat family, he added: ‘They must all receive the full sympathy of all those in court in the context of this simply awful event.’

The murder charge was left to lie on the court file.
