Calum Chambers posted a photo of himself and Jack Wilshere returning home after England's 2-0 win over Switzerland.

Arsenal's latest signing Danny Welbeck scored both goals to give Roy Hodgson's side victory in their opening European Championships qualifier.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was also in the squad but, like Chambers, he failed to make an appearance in Basel.

Gunners: Jack Wilshere and Calum Chambers return home from England's 2-0 win over Switzerland

The Gunners face Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday and Arsene Wenger will be hoping his side can perform better than last season when they only picked up one point from their two league meetings. 

Arsenal fans can take comfort, though, in new signing Welbeck's performance for England. 

Wenger's side have struggled for goals since Olivier Giroud's injury but the former Manchester United man could be the perfect replacement for the Frenchman.

Manchester City, meanwhile, could be without in-form striker Stevan Jovetic when they face Arsenal after the 24-year-old picked up a hamstring injury while on international duty with Montenegro.  

International: Calum Chambers made his international debut in England's recent friendly against Norway 

Studious: Wilshere said he would study videos of Andrea Pirlo to learn how to play a deeper role
