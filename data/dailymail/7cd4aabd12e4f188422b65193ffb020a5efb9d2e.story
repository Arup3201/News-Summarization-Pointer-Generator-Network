Controversial: The music director of the Royal Opera House, Sir Antonio Pappano, has launched an astonishing attack on modern day opera singers by claiming they are 'weaker in body' and likely to pull out of shows

The music director of the Royal Opera House has launched an astonishing attack on modern day opera singers by claiming they are 'weaker in body' and likely to pull out of shows.

Sir Antonio Pappano, who is one of the world's leading opera conductors, criticised singers for pulling out of productions too easily, saying at times this was due to illness but at others simply due to a lack of commitment.

The outspoken comments by the British-born conductor are likely to cause a massive stir in the operatic world, with its huge professional pressures and fragile egos.

Sir Antonio's comments reflect the growing frustration at
the RoH over increasing numbers of big stars pulling out of productions 
before the first night.

It follows criticism of a performance of Robert Le Diable last year, which some critics described as 'catastrophic'.

Pappano did not mention names, and defended the opera house's decision to stage Robert le Diable, but did not hold back in voicing his opinion of some of today's top opera stars.

Referring to cancellations, he said: 'It happens a lot. It happens more and more. There's something about this generation of singers, that they are weaker in their bodies or don't care.

'I don't know what it is, but it's something that is very very frustrating for me personally.'

Asked afterwards to expand on his remarks, he explained it was partly a health issue, with common colds tending to last longer than, say, 10 years ago.

Annoying: The Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden has been left frustrated over increasing numbers of big stars pulling out of productions before the first night

The frustrations of Sir Antonio Pappano follow an increasing numbers of big stars pulling out of productions 
before the first night.

Critics described a performance of Robert Le Diable last year as 'catastrophic' following last minute cast changes.

The original female lead in the show, Diana Damrau, withdrew due to 
pregnancy and was replaced by 
American soprano Jennifer Rowley.

However, The Royal Opera House made the decision in less than a week before curtains went up in December to replace Ms Rowley with Patrizia Ciofi in the rarely-performed Meyerbeer epic due to a 'musical problem'.

The original male lead Juan Diego Florez also pulled out of the performance and was replaced by tenor Bryan Hymel.

Since then German soprano Anja 
Harteros has pulled out of the role of Elizabeth of Valois in Don 
Carlo in May because she was 'not able at this point to stay abroad for
an extended period of time as originally planned', according to a 
statement.

Juan Diego Florez said: 'I was contacted by the ROH for the opera Robert Le Diable, as early as 2007. 

'Some months after, during 2008 (4 years before the premiere took place), I received the score from them and took a close look at it.

'After that, always in 2008, I decided that the role was a bit heavy for me, and I informed the ROH that I was not going to do it.

'It's important to be clear that I did not have any contract, nor any kind of agreement with the ROH to do Robert Le Diable.'

Diana Damrau declined to comment. 

'You can imagine singers. That's a real 
problem. And there's so much travelling involved now with good singing. I
think that people are overbooked, they're over-committed, too many new 
things, the stress on them and the amount of PR.'

The 53-year-old, who received a 
knighthood last year, said singers of today appeared to be physically 
weaker than past generations.

'I mean (for Spanish tenor Placido) Domingo to cancel, (he) would have to be on his death bed. It's just a different generation.

'It's taken much more lightly today, the idea of contract, the idea of a commitment. It's true.'

He called on opera stars to take longer rest periods between roles to cut down on the risk of illness and exhaustion.

Sir Antonio's controversial comments were made at a press briefing to outline 
the upcoming season at the Royal Opera House.
