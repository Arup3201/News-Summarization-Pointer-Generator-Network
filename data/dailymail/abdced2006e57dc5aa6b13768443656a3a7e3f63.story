Arrest threat: Helen Perry who joked on Facebook that she would squirt out the Olympic flame with her son's water pistol

A mother-of-two who joked on Facebook that she would squirt the Olympic flame out with a water pistol was given a police warning.

Helen Perry, 36, was threatened with arrest after writing that she had her son’s water guns at the ready after learning that people who live 60 miles away had been chosen to carry the torch through her hometown.

She also said that she would blockade the route through Bridlington, East Yorkshire, until they chose a local person to take part in the relay.

Several weeks after posting the light-hearted comments on a local newspaper page, she received a call from police.

'I could not believe what I was hearing when I answered my phone and it was the police calling about what I had written on Facebook,' said the former care home manager.

'At first I thought it was a joke.

'The officer I spoke to warned me that if I carried out what I had joked about online then I would be committing a criminal offence and would be arrested.

'I understand that security is very tight at the moment what with the Olympics and the Queen’s Jubilee but this was very clearly a joke.

'Bridlington is quite a small place 
and it was just like we were having a conversation between friends on 
Facebook.

'The tone was clearly light-hearted.

'I got quite a telling off and I remember him mentioning something about terrorism.

'I felt quite stupid because I have warned people in the past to be careful what they post on Facebook.'

Mrs Perry said she assured the police officer that she would not do anything to disrupt the relay when it passes through Bridlington later this month.

Mrs Perry first posted: 'there are people in brid who do deserve the privilege and should’ve been a consideration.'

She later wrote: 'Let’s all have a street party on the route so its blocked till they hand the torch to a brid born and bred person. Lol.'

Another user wrote on the thread that they should arm themselves with water guns and put the flame out in protest.

In a light-hearted response Mrs Perry put: 'I’ve already nicked the kids water guns. LoL.'

A spokesman for Humberside Police confirmed that words of advice were offered to a Bridlington woman following comments made about disruption to the Olympic Torch’s progress in advance of its forthcoming visit to the region.

Assistant Chief Constable Alan Leaver said: 'We are delighted the torch is coming to the region. Officers from the Yorkshire and Humber region want to make sure that it is a happy event which people can come and enjoy.

'Anyone intent on causing trouble will be dealt with appropriately. We won’t allow people to make a nuisance of themselves.'

Today the torch relay passed through Cheshire, where credit controller Karen Ashton, 38, carried the flame between Knutsford and Macclesfield.

Ms Ashton was nominated for the 'structured approach she has instilled in the team'.

The 70-day relay started in Land’s End and will finish on July 27 at the opening ceremony of the Games.

Each torch cost £495 to make but runners were offered the chance to buy them for just £215, while those who won their places through sponsors, such as Coca-Cola, were given them for free.

Many of the torch-bearers have listed the torch for sale on Ebay, with some demanding £100,000.

Olympic bosses have come under fire for allowing The Voice’s American judge Will.i.am carry the Games’ torch.

The threat was made on the eve of the third day of the Torch relay prior to the Olympic flame being carried through the Somerset town.
