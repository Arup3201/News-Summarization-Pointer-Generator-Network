West Ham keeper Adrian called his side's victory over QPR 'unbelievable' after his 89-year-old grandfather came over to watch him play.

The Hammers continued their impressive form - Nedum Onuoha scored an own goal before Diafra Sakho's fifth goal of the season clinched the win.

Spanish keeper Adrian kept a clean sheet while his family watched on - his grandfather left Spain for the first time in his life to come and watch the match.

Speaking to the club website, Adrian said: 'We put in another very good performance and we got our first clean sheet. My family also came over from Spain, including my grandfather who is 89-years-old, so it was unbelievable. He enjoyed it very much.

'My grandfather watched me play every time I played in Real Betis, but this is the first time he has come to watch me play in England. 

'He is a very old man and this is the first time he has been out of Spain, but he has enjoyed it very much. My grandfather gave me congratulations for the victory and also for the clean sheet! 

'I didn't have too much work to do, but I prefer this because this is a good situation for the team.'
