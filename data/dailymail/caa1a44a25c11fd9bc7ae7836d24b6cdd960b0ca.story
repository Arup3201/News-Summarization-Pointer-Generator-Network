An 'alien' planet believed to be up to five times bigger than Jupiter has been detected 300 light years from Earth.

The giant ball of gas has been pictured orbiting its young star by the European Southern Observatory.

The planet, known as HD 95086 b, is 
shown as a bright blue dot at the bottom left of the picture and was 
spotted by the ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile.

The star, HD 95086, has been removed from the picture to allow the planet to shine through, Fox News has reported.

Julien Rameau, astronomer at the Institute of Astrophysics and Planetology in France, is lead author of the study.

Announcing the discovery he said: 'Direct imaging of planets is an extremely challenging technique that requires the most advanced instruments, whether ground-based or in space.

'Only a few planets have been directly observed so far, making every single discovery an important milestone on the road to understanding giant planets and how they form.'

The researchers have said it may be the lightest, or 'least massive', planet that is not in the solar system and has been directly observed.

Most exoplanets are not pictured directly but are often detected through indirect means, such as noticing a dip in a star's brightness when a planet passes in front of it, blocking its light.

According to the research, which will be published in an upcoming image of Astrophysical Journal Letters, the planet orbits the star at about 56 times the distance between Earth and the Sun.

Last week MailOnline reported how Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope could be used to find alien planets capable of supporting life.

Researchers at MIT said the telescope could look for small, Mars-size rocky exoplanets orbiting 'failed stars', known as brown dwarfs.

They said the hunt could uncover planets capable of supporting life.
