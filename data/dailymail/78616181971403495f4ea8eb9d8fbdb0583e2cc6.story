Before the rise of vast service stations and faceless coffee chains, hungry drivers relied on traditional truck stops like Peggy's Diner and the Blue Sky Cafe to refuel them on long journeys.

Once a familiar sight along the UK's road network, such independent cafes have been all but wiped out by sprawling services, prompting one photographer to take to the road and document the surviving stops where motorists can enjoy a hot drink and a bacon sandwich - and still have change from £3.50.

Snapper Sam Mellish downed 'hundreds' of cups of tea as he travelled 6,000 miles along the UK's major A-routes in a bid to capture the 'open road feeling' with his series of images of the last remaining roadside cafes.

Fuelling travellers' journeys: Independent roadside cafes - like the Orchard Cafe on the fringes of Greater London - are a dying breed, but a photographer has travelled the length and breadth of the country to capture the remnants of a bygone era

Quaint: Traditional roadside truck stops like Peggy's Diner in Antrim, Northern Ireland, have largely been replaced by sprawling service stations

'We spend much of our lives on the road commuting, working, setting off on holiday, or just drifting,' Mr Mellish said.

'I wanted to capture the open road feeling, like songs such as Route 66 or the Road To Hell.

'I have travelled more than 6,000 miles, used 800 litres of petrol - and I have drunk hundred of cups of tea and bacon sarnies,' he said of his project.

'But
these independent places are under threat - several of those I 
photographed at the beginning of the project have since closed down.'

Historians and architectural experts echoed Mr Mellish's concern for the 'fast disappearing' cafes.

Catherine Croft, director of The Twentieth Century Society, described them as a 'unique and irreplaceable part of our heritage'.

'They
may not be attributed to named architects but they have been seen by 
thousands of visitors originally introducing them to new styles and 
materials,' she said.

'Often it is the way that everything is designed from the building down to signage and napkins that makes them so evocative.

'Sam’s images capture a world whose passing is happening so quietly that it is in danger of vanishing without record.

'We
can learn as much from these modest buildings as grand ones and these 
cafes tell a wealth of stories about how we have travelled, relaxed and 
sped on our way through the twentieth century,' Ms Croft said.

Pit stop: The sight of this burger shack is no doubt a welcome one for many a hungry motorist on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall

Postcard perfect: Sam Mellish trekked 6,000 miles along the UK's major A routes to document traditional roadside diners - including the picturesque Blue Sky Cafe in Norfolk, which overlooks the coast

Welcome sight: The Farm Cafe, on the A17, has been refuelling motorists for more than half a century, having been established when the parents of the current owner set up a tea stop on the side of the route

Trucker's salvation: Rustic looking cabin the Midway Stop serves food and beverages to drivers heading along the eastbound A14 in Suffolk

No-frills: This shack-like roadside cafe is a far cry from the sprawling service stations that have sprung up along the country's motorways in recent decades

Faded: Traditional roadside cafes are a 'unique and irreplaceable' part of the country's architectural heritage, according to the Twentieth Century Society

Value: The photographer said he wanted his series of images to capture the 'open road feeling' summed up by songs like Route 66 or the Road to Hell

Social and cultural historian Joe Moran 
said: 'Before the M1 opened in 1959 there were no service stations and 
roadside variety reigned.

'Well-to-do motorists used to visit road houses - lavish hostelries that boasted swimming pools, ballrooms and even polo fields.

'Lorry drivers swore by the greasy spoon transport cafes like Kate’s Cabin on the A1 and Berts on the A30.

'Then came service stations which became bland corporate spaces like roadside shopping malls,' Mr Moran said.

'Even the A roads, which used to be the last redoubt of the transport cafe, are now being colonised by chain owners.

'But there are still parts of the British roadside that resist the pull of sameness and blandness.

'When
they first opened motorway service stations were stylish places where 
young people would would drive at high speeds to play pinball and drink 
Cona coffee.

'But as operators
began to cut costs service stations became a notorious land of un-swept
floors, sticky tabletops and congealed food slowly dying under 
hot-lamps. Now they have become almost like airports - clean, efficient and expensive,' the historian added.

'A corporate owned mono-culture now increasingly rules the roadside.'

These images in more are seen in Mr Mellish's book, Roadside Britain, published by Diesel Books.

Influence: The design of OK Diners like this one is inspired by the iconic roadside cafes that crop up along America's highways

Character: They may be small - like the Popham Diner on the A303 in Hampshire - but Britain's roadside cafes boast vast car parks ideal for trucks and coaches

Corporate: Modern service stations like the London Gateway services on the M1 motorway have all but overtaken independent roadside rest stops
