A new two-part television show will offer a glimpse into the harsh reality of life for those living on Darndale, dubbed Ireland's toughest estate.

The first episode of Benefits Estate airs tonight and viewers will see how some of the 600 residents of Darndale struggle to make ends meet on the estate where unemployment is high and drugs and crime rife.

One of those appearing in the first episode is new mother Gemma Geraghty, who is struggling as she balances the demands of a newborn with decisions on whether to spend her benefits on lighting or food.

The 19-year-old faces a daily battle to make ends meet as she cares for her mum, Roseanne, and newborn son Alfie on the estate where teenagers ride horses bareback through the streets. 

'I get 100 Euros a week, which is nothing really, not with a baby to care for,' says Gemma, who also shares the house with her brother, sister, two dogs and two cats.

'By the time I've bought things for him, there's not much left.

'Running the house entirely on benefits is a constant struggle. We haven't run out of heating yet. But every Monday and Wednesday the lights go out.

The teenager is one of a number of residents who will be seen on Benefits Estate tonight on Channel 5.

'I got most of my baby's clothes off my sister whose own baby has just passed away and from nice people on Facebook,' said Gemma.

'And when I'm done with them I'm going to hand them over to whoever wants them.'

Her mother, Roseanne, cradling four-week-old baby Alfie, said she had been battling depression for a long time and rarely went out.

'On a bad day I won't get out of bed at all,' she said.

In Ireland, families have to pay to get their waste removed, and  as they haven't had any spare cash to do this, the rubbish has piled up, says Gemma.

'The rubbish has got stuck in the drains and flooded the garden, so we can't do any washing,' said Gemma.

'I don't know what that rubbish carries, it's unhygienic!'

Roseanne says she is embarrassed by the amount of litter in bin bags.'

'It's embarrassing for me and when you suffer from depression, things just get on top of you.'

Single mother, Angelique, who has a young son, Brody, has spent her whole life on the estate and knows the alleyways well.

'As a kid if you wanted to be a bully, you would go in the alleyway and not let anyone pass until they gave you money,' she said.

'Or the boys and girls would each have their own bit of alley where they would go. It was all kids stuff, but then you grow up into the big bad world.'

Having been on the waiting list for two years, he know he has to go, but is upset as he says goodbye to his daughters.

'When I got into drugs, I was you,' said Noel. 'Two friends asked me to buy a bag of heroin and I did. Just one quick decision, that takes a minute, can turn your whole world upside down so you don't have a life any more.'
