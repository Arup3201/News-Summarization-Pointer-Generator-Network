Many people enjoy their birthdays by letting their hair down and having plenty to drink - but it seems one man took the celebrations a little too far.

James Taylor told police he drank an incredible 48 beers in one evening to mark his 58th birthday on Hudson Beach, Florida, this week.

The transient bizarrely told deputies it was about ten beers too many - and he also allegedly exposed his genitals and urinated in the sand.

Taylor was drinking by the beach on Wednesday evening and was given a stern lecture from a deputy because he was shouting at people.

He then left the area but later came back and caused such a disturbance that he scared a woman and her young grandchildren.

Then he exposed his genitals, ‘urinated in the middle of the sand’ and ‘went back to yelling profanities’, authorities told the St. Petersburg Times.

A Pasco County sheriff's deputy then returned to the beach, arrested Taylor and took him to the Land O'Lakes jail.

He was charged with disorderly intoxication in a public place and causing a disturbance. Taylor remained in jail on Thursday in lieu of $100 bail.

Hudson Beach is a small coastal community on the west coast of Florida, around 30 miles north of Tampa.

The story of Taylor's arrest has generated a buzz of excitement online, especially on the HyperVocal news website.

'He should probably be charged instead with drinking watered-down beer, it said. 'How else to explain the fact that he’s still among the living?'
