A young ballerina with Stage 4 breast cancer has launched a social media campaign to raise money for her medical treatments.

Maggie Kudirka, a 23-year-old dancer at New York's Joffrey Ballet School, received the devastating diagnosis on June 19 after discovering a large lump at the top of her left breast.

Upon visiting a second doctor, she learned that the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes, sternum, spine and pelvis.

Leap of faith: Maggie Kudirka, a 23-year-old dancer with Stage 4 cancer, launched a social media campaign to help raise funds for her medical treatments

Miss Kudirka created the Bald Ballerina Facebook page to update family and friends on her condition, and raise awareness for the disease. She subsequently started a fundraising page on Youcaring.com to help pay for medical expenses.

'I want to make people aware that breast cancer can strike anyone, at any age. No one is immune, no one is too young, no one is too fit,' she told Today.com.

She uses Facebook to share personal anecdotes and inform friends of her symptoms.

Earlier this week, she wrote: 'My dad took me to the gym to work out with personal trainer Diana. It was a great workout, but after about 40 minutes, I got dizzy and light-headed and had to stop. I can't know for sure if it was a chemo side effect or if it was because I skipped breakfast. I'm hoping it was the empty stomach.'

Support network: Miss Kudirka, pictured getting fitted for a wig, said she is 'overwhelmed' by the caring messages she has received

Worthy cause: The 23-year-old has already raised more than $5,000 for medical expenses

'No one is immune': 'No one is too young, no one is too fit,' the previously healthy dancer said

Miss Kudirka is on her family's health insurance plan, which she says has a high deductible and out-of-pocket expenses.

So far, she has raised $5,263 toward her goal of $25,000.

She's also found a supportive community on Facebook, where strangers have sent words of encouragement.

'I
 am overwhelmed by the numerous prayers and caring messages I have 
received, many from people I have never met. It means so much that so 
many people care about me,' she writes.

Her mother, Aldona Kudirka, told Today.com that it's also helped take her mind off the disease.

'Bald
 Ballerina has been the best medicine for Maggieâ€¦ she was not accustomed
 to having so much down time,' she said, adding: 'She now has something 
to look forward to every day and she has grown more optimistic with 
every message she has received.'
