Keeping a respectful distance on the dance floor, no short skirts and no alcohol-fuelled after-parties: this is no normal prom.

In fact, it's the eighth annual 'Mormon Prom' in Morristown, New Jersey, a night of modesty at a decorated basketball court at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Nearly 300 students aged between 16 and 18 gathered at the hall on Saturday - some traveling from outside states to attend - for a night of good clean fun.

Date night: Richard Murray, 18, and Allison Garner, 18, share a dance at the prom, which is open to all teens

The event, 
which started after local teens complained about lewd behavior at their 
schools' proms, was open to students of any religious affiliation, not 
just Mormons.

But all had to abide by its rules - no drinking, inappropriate clothing or alcohol.

'There is no pressure to do anything 
immodest or reckless, like party or drink afterwards,' Anna Jensen,
 a Mormon who attended the dance with two Catholic friends, told the New Jersey Star-Ledger.

'The music was 
clean and the dancing was also clean. Overall, it was just a group of 
kids, Mormon or not Mormon, that wanted to enjoy themselves without 
being influenced by what our modern society believes to be the norm.'

The students were encouraged to skip the usual pricey practices, such as buying new dresses or arriving in a limousine, and most were taken by their parents, who then socialized together in a separate room.

Some 
students like Anna and junior Matt Norton said they would also be going 
to their school's prom, while others attended instead of their school's 
event.

'I'm going to my school prom in May,' Norton, a fellow Mormon who attends Morristown High School said. 'The types of dancing and music will be very different. It will be more inappropriate at the school prom.'

And he added: 'Girls still look good in modest dresses.'

The prom began eight years ago when students complained to their parents about their high school dances, the Star-Ledge explained.

Getting to know each other: Justin Lippert, 18, and Jennifer Dulin, 18, talk at one of the prom tables. All students at the dance must abide by its rules to keep a distance and avoid short skirts and alcohol

Two local Latter-day youth leaders, Cindy Manchester from Pompton Plains and Heidi Elton from Short Hills, joined together to address the concerns their daughters and other students had with their school dances, including steep prices and immodest clothes.

They approached their church leaders and their plan was approved, with the first prom being held in 2006. Mormon churches across New Jersey sponsor the prom.
