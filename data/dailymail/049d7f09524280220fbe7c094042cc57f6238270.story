Pope Benedict has denounced economic structures that put profits ahead of people at the start of a trip to recession-hit Spain where the costs of the pontiff's visit have sparked violent protests.                

'The economy cannot be measured by the maximum profit but by the common good,' Benedict told journalists on the plane taking him to Madrid for a four-day trip centered around the Roman Catholic Church's World Youth Day festivities.               

'The economy cannot function only with mercantile self-regulation but needs an ethical reason in order to work for man,' he said.

Popular figure: The Pope is swamped by thousands of supporters as the entourage winds its way through central Madrid

The Pope arrived in Madrid to jubilant scenes yesterday morning at the start of a four-day trip to the Spanish capital.

But the trip  was not without controversy - protesters marched on the city's central Sol Plaza to voice 
their concerns about the 50million euro price tag for the visit.

The Spanish economy is struggling to 
exit a recession which has left one in five unemployed, of which a large
proportion are young people.  

Disaffection over government spending cuts, a sickly economy and a lack 
of job prospects has spawned a protest movement named Los Indignados 
(Indignant Ones) whose young supporters occupied Madrid's Puerta del Sol
square in May.

The costs of 84-year-old Benedict's visit to Spain at a time of economic
hardship has reignited protests by Los Indignados and others, including
gay and lesbian groups, and demonstrations turned violent on Wednesday 
night.                               

Eight people were hurt and eight were arrested as a result of clashes 
between pilgrims and protesters, police and emergency services 
said.            

But a protest in Puerta del Sol against the police action last night 
drew barely 200 people and failed to dampen the enthusiasm of the 
thousands of pilgrims gathered in nearby Cibeles square.

Chanting 'We are the Pope's youth', and waving a colourful mixture of 
Vatican flags and others from the roughly 190 countries participating in
the World Youth Day jamboree, the young people cheered and applauded 
Benedict's arrival in Cibeles after receiving the keys to the city from 
Madrid's mayor.

Benedict expressed his solidarity and support for young people faced 
with an uncertain jobs outlook, but warned of the challenges of 
consumerism and hedonism and the 'widespread trivialisation of 
sexuality' in a speech on his arrival at Madrid's Barajas airport 
yesterday morning.          

He reinforced his message later to the young pilgrims in Cibeles square,
criticising people who 'create their own gods, believe they need no 
roots or foundations...letting themselves be led by the whim of each 
moment'.  

Screaming: These pilgrims were very vocal in showing their support for the Pope as he passed them in central Madrid

Cheers: The Pope has so far received a warm welcome everywhere he has been in Madrid, despite protests against his visit descending into violence last night

Spanish Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has 
clashed with the church over abortion and has changed the law during his
tenure to make it easier for women seeking to terminate unwanted 
pregnancies.

In 2005, Spain became the third country to legalise gay marriage. The 
law, promoted by Zapatero despite opposition from the church, allows 
married gay couples to adopt children.  

Earlier in the day, the pontiff had touched down at Barajas 
airport just before 11am on an Alitalia flight from Rome, and was 
greeted by the country's King and Queen on a red carpet.

He then travelled in his Popemobile to the Nunciature, in the city centre, where he spent most of the afternoon.

King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia 
were joined by the Archbishop of Madrid Rouco Varela in walking up to 
the plane to greet His Holiness.

A military band played the Spanish and Vatican national anthems. The group walked over to the terminal where the Pope was greeted by the Spanish President, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.

King Juan Carlos thanked the Pope for visiting Spain three times in his first six years as pontiff.

Each of the pilgrims have been given a special goodie bag for the event.

The bags include a map of Madrid, a bottle of non-alcoholic beer, their pilgrim pass, a guide, a cross and a fan.

He said: 'We interpret this as a very special distinction for our country.'

He added that there was a 'crisis of 
values' and that these were not easy times for youngsters. 'It is time 
for us to double our efforts,' he added.

Pope
Benedict replied, in clear Spanish, by giving his thanks to the King 
and Queen, to the authorities and the pilgrims who had congregated at 
the airport.

He praised the hospitality of the people of Madrid, and the work of the volunteers of the World Youth Day.

The 84-year-old also said that youngsters faced many challenges, including corruption and consumerism.

Wednesday night's violence came on the same day that police arrested a 24-year-old chemistry student suspected of planning a gas attack against the protesters opposing the visit.

A statement from officers said Jose Perez Bautista, of Puebla, Mexico, boasted online how he planned to attack anti-Pope protesters with 'suffocating gases' and other chemicals.

He had been working as a volunteer for the visit and was arrested at a convention centre where the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims coming to town for the papal visit are supposed to pick up their accreditation.

Police searched his apartment in the wealthy Salamanca district of Madrid and seized an external hard-drive and two notebooks with chemical equations that had nothing to do with his studies.

Newspaper El País reported he has been freed on conditional bail and should present himself to a judge each day.
