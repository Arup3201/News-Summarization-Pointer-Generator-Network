Daniel Andreas San Diego, an animal rights activist, who the FBI are hunting for charges of exploding pipe bombs at companies linked to animal experiments. He is considered armed and dangerous, and the agency are offering $250,000 for any information

The FBI has mobilised to Hawaii after receiving what they call 'credible intelligence' that a domestic terrorist suspect on their most wanted list may be hiding on the island.

Agents are hunting for Daniel Andreas San Diego in the eastern part of the state's 'Big Island', in the eastern district of Puna, focusing on the small town of Pahoa.

They launched the search when they receiving intelligence that he has been spotted on the island, after he slipped the FBI's 24 hour surveillance in downtown San Francisco in 2003.

San Diego, 36, is suspected to be a domestic rights extremist, charged with exploding pipe bombs in front of buildings of two companies tied to animal experiment labs in the San Francisco Bay Area.Â 

He currently tops the FBI's most wanted terrorist list and is considered armed and dangerous, and is believed to possess a gun.

The agency are currently offering a $250,000 reward for information leading to his capture.

The FBI interviewed Kai Sorte, a local organic deli manager in Pahoa, who said agents had visited the small town 18 months ago in search of San Diego.

Sorte was interviewed again by agents earlier this week, and said they believe San Diego is 'looking for some sort of cause or movement' to join.

The trip to Hawaii may have been part of the recent push to get information on San Diego, who has been at large since 2003 after slipping an FBI tail.

Earlier this month San Diego's image appeared on several electronic billboards across the country, including above Times Square in New York City earlier this month.

San Diego was raised in an upper-middle class family in a suburb of San Francisco.

His father, Edmund San Diego, a city manager of a wealthy San Francisco community has refused to talk about his son.

San Diego is charged with setting off three bombs at two biotechnology companies in the early hours of the morning on August 28 and September 26 2003.

No one was injured in the explosions, but windows were shattered and the building suffered minor damage.

The FBI received credible intelligence from the shopkeeper of an organic food store that San Diego has been seen on Big Island in Hawaii, 'looking for a cause to join'

Two pipe bomb explosions struck the Chiron Corporation, a company tied to animal experiments, with investigators believing the second pipe bomb was designed to harm authorities responding to the incident.

A third bomb, strapped with nails, hit Shaklee Corp, a cosmetic maker, a month later.

FBI have been searching for San Diego across the world, contacting officials in Germany, the U.K, Costa Rica, France, Spain, Denmark, Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic, Mexico, Argentina, the Philippines and Chile.

San Diego has been linked to animal rights extremist groups, and has been identified as a vegan who doesn't eat food containing animal products.

In the past, he has worked as a computer network specialist, and is skilled with different operating systems, as well as sailing.

The FBI said he can also be identified by his unusual tattoos, including a round image of burning hillsides on his chest, emblazoned below with the words 'It only takes a spark', and a tattoo spanning his back and abdomen portraying burning and collapsing buildings.
