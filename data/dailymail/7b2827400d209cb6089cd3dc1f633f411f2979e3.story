Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has called for the firm to work with arch rival Google and produce a phone running Android software.

He believes there is nothing stopping Apple from taking on Samsung and other Android phone makers.

He said he believes an android iPhone would 'compete very well.'

Wozniak believes there is nothing stopping Apple from taking on Samsung and other Android phone makers. He said he believes an android iPhone would 'compete very well.'

'There’s nothing that would keep Apple out of the Android market as a secondary phone market,” Wozniak told Wired magazine.

'We could compete very well. People like the precious looks of stylings and manufacturing that we do in our product compared to the other Android offerings.

'We could play in two arenas at the same time.'

Experts say that although highly unliklely, an Android iPhone is technically possible.

Firms such as Samsung and Motorola already have their own 'skins' for Google's software.

Amazon has gone one step further and created its own version of Android, known as a fork, for the Kindle tablets it makes.

Doing this would allow Apple to keep its Android handset looking similar to its own iOS software.

However, it would also require Apple to pay Google to license its apps such as Gmail and Maps.

Wozniak also defended called for apple to quickly release radical new product categories such as a Tv ans watch.

Wozniak also admitted to Wired that he owned all three colours of Apple's iPhone 5S

'The great products really come from secret development,' he said.

'You put small teams of great people on them and they aren’t bothered by other people commenting on what they’re doing while they’re doing it.

'A whole new category of products doesn’t happen very often. It might happen once a decade. Sometimes you have to wait for one of those to come about.'

It is not the first time Wozniak has called for apple to work with Google.

The Apple co-founder told the BBC he wishes ‘to God' his tech firm and Google will be partners in the future.

He also admitted Apple’s voice recognition service Siri can't always live up to the same standards as Google’s Android version.

A partnership between the two firms could make phones better, he continued.

In the interview with BBC Click, Wozniak, 63, said: ‘Sometimes I say 'Go to Joe's Diner' and [Siri] doesn't know where Joe's Diner is.

'And very often usually I find out that Android does.’

He continued that Google’s success is down to the fact Android has the benefit of being directly linked to the California-based firm’s search engine and results – something Apple doesn’t have the benefit of.

Wozniak adds that Android is the ‘future of intelligence for computers getting smarter’ and wishes the two companies could join forces.

If the two companies combined, Wozniak claims the information that could be shared would benefit all those involved, and ultimately benefit the paying customers.

Wozniak ruffled Apple fanboy feathers by admitting wouldn’t be interested in buying the new iPad Air.

The 9.7-inch tablet, said to be 20 per
 cent thinner than previous models, officially went on sale on Friday, 
but Wozniak won’t be buying one.

He told the Apps World conference in 
London: 'Yes it's thinner but I wanted storage' adding he was tempted, 
but in the end emailed his wife saying he wouldn't be getting one.

He additionally claims there are features on Samsung phones he wishes were in his iPhone and wants every company to share the good technology to encourage development, especially in wearable technology, including smartwatches.

Looking further forward, Wozniak told the BBC he believes we’re on the verge of having products with ‘foldability and flexibility’ and predicts this will be where the real technological advancements will lie.
