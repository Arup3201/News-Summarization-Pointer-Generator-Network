An American tourist had to be rescued from a luxury cruise ship off the southern coast of Vietnam last night after he suffered a medical emergency.

A photo shows the dramatic moment a specialised marine search and rescue team swept in and removed the 89-year-old man from the Seven Seas Voyager on a backboard after he suffered a possible heart attack, according to reports.

The ship was met by rescuers some 30 nautical miles from Da Nang, Vietnam as it sailed into the Gulf of Tonkin towards Ha Long Bay, a Unesco World Heritage Site east of the capital, Hanoi.

A spokesperson for the Da Nang Maritime Rescue Coordination Center told Thanhnien News that its members received a distress signal from the all-suite ship, operated by Miami-based Regent Seven Seas Cruises, a subsidiary of Norwegian Cruise Line.

Doctors provided first aid instructions over the phone to the ship’s crew, and the man was brought ashore and rushed to hospital about four hours after the distress call, said Thanhnien News.

It said strong winds and ‘rogue waves’ made it difficult to reach the cruise ship, but when rescuers arrived the man was able to speak to them despite suffering from chest pains and fatigue.

He was reportedly in stable condition in hospital.

MailOnline Travel has contacted Regent Seven Seas Cruises for comment.

The all-suite luxury cruise ship is currently on a 34-night cruise from Singapore to Tianjin, China

The 670ft vessel is currently docked at Ha Long Bay and is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong and cruise across the South China Sea on Wednesday.

According to an online itinerary, the Seven Seas Voyager is on a 34-night cruise from Singapore to Tianjin, China, a port city southeast of Beijing.

The journey is scheduled to end February 21, although some passengers are on a shorter, 18-night trip that departed the same day and concludes in Hong Kong on Thursday.

With nine decks and balconies for every room, the Seven Seas Voyager can accommodate up to 700 guests and nearly 450 crew.
