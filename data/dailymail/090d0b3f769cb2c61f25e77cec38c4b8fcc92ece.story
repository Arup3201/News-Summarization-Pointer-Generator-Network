The ex-wife of Strictly Come Dancing winner Mark Ramprakash slashed her brother's arm with a broken glass after he found her semi-conscious and surrounded by empty bottles on the sofa, a court has heard.

Vandana Bhatt, who split from the former England cricketer in 2010, was found by her brother Nitin, on the sofa demanding 'more wine'.

But she was acquitted at St Albans' Magistrates Court today after prosecutors were unable to prove the injury was caused deliberately

The court had heard how her brother, Mr Bhatt, went to his sister's home in Watford, on July 12 to check on her after the 44-year-old had called him to beg for his help. 

As he attempted to help her, she bit down on a thin tumbler glass and slashed his arm with the broken shards, magistrates were told.

The court heard how Bhatt was left with cuts to her mouth and nose, while her brother was left with a 'nasty injury' that caused 'significant blood loss'.

Police arrived and she was arrested and later charged with assault by beating.

Prosecutor Harry Snook told the court: 'At the time, the defendant was alcohol dependant and had been drinking that day.

'There may be some uncertainty as to how intoxicated she was.

'The complainant is the defendant’s brother. He became concerned during the day about her welfare and he travelled some distance to check on her.

'We say, having gained access to the premises, he found her in an intoxicated state and, during what followed, she broke a glass and she cut her brothers arm with the glass, causing a relatively nasty injury.'

Bhatt broke down in tears as her brother, who himself was a self-confessed alcoholic for ten years, described the attack, which took place in front of his son.

He said: 'She had called me as was just saying "please help me".

'We got to the property at about 5.30. When we reached the lounge she was semi-conscious on the sofa and there was lots of alcohol bottles on the floor.

'When she saw us, she just said "give me some wine". I didn't want my son to see his auntie in that state so I sent him upstairs.

The court heard that Bhatt was granted a quickie divorce from Mr Ramprakash, pictured with dance partner Karen Hardy, on the grounds of her unreasonable behaviour 

'She had a very thin glass in her hand. This was behaviour I had never seen from her before. She bit into the glass and part of it disintegrated. She cut her mouth and she was bleeding from her mouth and nose.

'She had been trying to drag herself to the kitchen but then she got to a height where she lunged at me with the glass.'

The court heard how Bhatt, divorced from Mr Ramprakash in 2010 on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour, had not been eating for several months and her weight had plunged to seven stone prior to the incident.

Mr Bhatt, who had retracted his witness statement prior to the trial and asked for her case to be dropped, told the court he did not believe she meant to hurt him.

The court heard that after Bhatt split from the former England cricketer, she had not been eating for several months and her weight plummeted to seven stone 

The RBS senior bank manager, who broke down in tears himself on several occasions during his testimony, said: 'I don’t know that, at that time, her lunging at me with the glass was a malicious action. It wasn’t to harm me or to do me any damage at all.

'I believe it was a case of, with her broken ankle, her falling into me. We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for the shock and the adrenalin that kicked in at the time. She is not a violent person and has never been.

'There was a lot of blood lost and there is a scar.'

Defence lawyer Gabrielle Moore told magistrates they should dismiss the charge on the grounds of there being no case to answer.

She said: 'It was clearly an involuntary act based on the evidence of her brother. She was in a very fragile state at the time.'

Magistrates took less than 30 minutes before confirming the case would be dismissed - an announcement that brought further tears to Bhatt.

Chairman of the bench Kevin Walsh said: 'We do not find there is a case to answer because we don't find that a tribunal could convict on the evidence up to this point.

'We say that because Mr Bhatt said under oath that he believed the injury was caused by her falling on to him. For those reasons we dismiss the case.' 

Ms Bhatt made no comment as she left court.
