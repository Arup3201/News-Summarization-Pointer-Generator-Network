A Texas city cop once hailed as a hero after she pursued a suspect who'd just shot her in the face is now under fire for allegedly shooting an unarmed suspect in the face as he sat in his car a year earlier.

Officer Ann Carrizales is a former Marine who was even honored by President Obama for her bravery in the line of duty during the 2013 incident in which a suspect shot her twice, including in the face.

But a year before, in October 2012, a lawsuit filed this week claims Carrizales was the one who fired an unnecessary shot the struck a suspect in the face.

Stafford, Texas cop Ann Carrizales (right) was once hailed as a hero after she pursued a suspect who'd just shot her in the chest and face. She is now under fire for allegedly shooting an unarmed suspect in the face as he sat in his car a year earlier. That suspect, Jay Mazoch, is pictured after he was shot at left

The suspect was Jay Mazoch, who's now suing Carrizales and the city of Stafford.

'This is a clear example of excessive force - deadly force,' Mazoch's attorney Randall Kallinen told reporters at a news conference held Tuesday in Houston.

The suit claims Mazoch, who has no prior criminal record, was shot at point blank range 'while he sat in a motionless car.'

The suit claims Mazoch was unarmed and had voluntarily approached Carrizales and her fellow officer near his home, where they were investigating something unrelated to Mazoch, according to Chron.com. 

The officer he spoke to then rudely told Jay to go away, according to the suit. 

He said, she said: Carrizales (left) says Jay Mazoch (right) used his car as a deadly weapon, but Mazoch says he did no such thing and was shot for no good reason

However, the suit claims 'police began striking Jay in the face with a metal object at the driver's side window' after he'd gotten into his car.

According to audio taken at the scene by the squad car's dash cam, a female officer's voice demands repeatedly that Mazoch turn off the car. 

Mazoch's voice cannot be heard until after shots were fired, at which point he can be heard explaining that he was 'scared' and had heard shots fired in his neighborhood.

Mazoch's attorney claims his client was totally unarmed.

'At no time when Carrizales was in front of Jay's vehicle did the vehicle move forward,' the suit alleges. 'At no time did Jay strike any officer nor display a weapon of any kind.'

However, Carrizales claims that Mazoch--who was charged with aggravated assault against the two officers and with DWI--used his car as a weapon.

'He rolled the window up on her arm and drug her down the street,' Carrizales' attorney Greg Cagle said.

Mazoch is asking for punitive damages in this case of what, at least for now, boils down to a classic he said/she said.

Mazoch's attorney said it's also a case of heroic cop who is also capable of doing wrong. 

'Police officers of course are not all bad or all good,' Kallinen. 'She did a good thing there, and that's fantastic. However, a year earlier she shot my client in the face.'

Carrizales was shot in the face and chest from close-range during a routine traffic stop in 2013.

Despite her injuries, she chased the car and assisted in the arrest of the alleged gunman. 

After being shot she returned fire, blasting out of the rear window of the car containing the alleged gunman and two suspects.

The mother of two was saved, according to police chiefs, by her bullet-proof vest.

After continuing the chase, other police units joined her and the suspects were cornered in an apartment complex.

Sergio Francisco Rodriguez, who allegedly fired the shots, was located and taken into custody by Missouri City police officers.

Her valiant showing won Carrizales the nickname Robocop from her colleagues. 

Carrizales was honored for her valor with an invitation to sit before President Obama at his State of the Union nine months ago.
