Leonardo Ulloa has urged his Leicester team-mates to focus only on Hull - not their troubling form.

The Foxes go to the Tigers on Sunday winless in 13 games - losing their last six - to sit rock bottom of the Barclays Premier League.

They fell to an undeserved 2-1 defeat to Tottenham on Boxing Day despite Ulloa’s seventh goal of the season.

It left them six points behind Hull, who sit a place outside the bottom three, and Ulloa has targeted the Tigers.

The striker said: 'It’s difficult, we need to focus on the next game now. It’s different now, we play away and we need to win. For that we need to focus on the game.

'We are thinking about the positives for the next game. It’s difficult, this situation, but we can go to Hull believing in this team.

'We need to think positively, focus on the game and afterwards we can see.'

Ulloa netted his seventh goal in 18 games when he cancelled out Harry Kane’s first minute strike on Friday.

Christian Eriken’s free-kick winner downed the Foxes in the second half despite the hosts dominating.

Ulloa and Riyad Mahrez also hit the woodwork and the striker admitted he wants the win more than goals.

'The feeling for the striker is always good when you can get a goal but I want to win the game, it’s important for us,' he said.
