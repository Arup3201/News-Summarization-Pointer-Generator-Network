It’s the digital litmus test of what Americans talked about, thought about, and searched in the past twelve months.

Google revealed Thursday its 11th annual Zeitgeist – the people, places, culture, and most-searched terms that shaped 2011.

In the U.S., Rebecca Black- the teenager whose catchy hit Friday garnered millions of hits, late night talk show appearances, and even a record deal - was the most popular search of 2011.

Partying, partying: Rebecca Black, who rose to fame with her YouTube music video Friday, was the fastest-rising search in 2011

Surprisingly, Kim Kardashian didn’t rank in the top ten searches in the U.S., though the reality TV star whose marriage to Kris Humphries lasted a brief 72 days.

However, she placed second in the top celebrity search ranking.

The remainder of the top ten searches reflected a mix of current events, technology, and entertainment – Google’s answer to social networking behemoth Facebook Google+ came in second.

Apple was big in the top ten fastest rising searches, with not one but three searches, including iPhone 5, Steve Jobs, and iPad2.

Joyous occasion: The wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton was one of the biggest searches on Google this year

Hurricane Irene – one of the most destructive and deadliest hurricanes to hit the U.S. since 1980 – ranked third. The storm killed at least 23 people on its destructive route along the eastern seaboard.

Year of Apple: Steve Jobs, iPhone 5 and iPad 2 topped the list of Google searches

More than 5.8million people lost electricity, while flooding destroyed roadways and homes of thousands.

Casey Anthony, the 25-year-old Florida woman charged – and later acquitted – of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee, was the seventh most popular.

Searches for ‘Casey Anthony’ and related searches like ‘Casey Anthony Case’ grew 2,680 per cent from 2010 to 2011, according to Google.

On a lighter note, the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton was one of the most popular wedding searches of the year, as was the Kardashian wedding.

According to Zeitgeist, Japan was a trending topic in nearly every country – no doubt because of the crippling earthquake and tsunami that struck in March.

The
 Google zeitgeist list - meaning spirit of the times - is compiled from 
the searches through Google each year. Individual searchers are not 
identified.

It's become an 
annual event for the company - and has quickly been mirrored by social 
sites such as Facebook and Twitter, both of which share their own 'Top 
Ten' most shared around Christmas every year.

Google hosts a year-round Zeitgeist page that lets users monitor search terms' popularity over time.

 Google
 revealed today WHAT web users are searching for - but where do they go 
next? The seventh fastest rising news source in the U.S. is the Daily 
Mail - and it's third in the U.K.

In fact, Mail Online 
is ranked in the top seven 'destination' sites for news, TV and 
celebrities - all judged by where people go after Google searches, 
according to data from search experts Hitwise. 

Other British national newspapers failed to make the top ten - except for TV, where the Daily Mirror was placed tenth, data from Hitwise shows. No other online news outlets or TV channel sites made the top three in any of these categories.
