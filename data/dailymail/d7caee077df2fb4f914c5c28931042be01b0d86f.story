When going for an ultrasound, parents usually rely on their doctor to tell them everything is fine.

But one couple got the message straight from their baby after the fetus was pictured giving a 'thumbs up' inside the womb.

Father Brandon Hopkins posted the ultrasound picture on his Facebook page a few days ago, but when his brother shared the image on message board Reddit, it went viral.

Brandon Hopkins posted this ultrasound image online of his baby giving a 'thumbs up' in the womb, and after it was posted on Reddit by his brother it went viral 

Mr Hopkins told HLN-TV: 'My brother called me and said "Your babies are famous!"' 

He has now revealed that his partner is expecting twins with a due date in January, and that the couple will be finding out the sex of the baby soon.

The images was posted to Reddit on August 28 by a user named 'meancloth' along with the message 'ultrasound looks good'. 

Reddit users quickly branded the child 'Fonzie fetus' after Happy Days character The Fonz, and his famous thumbs up gesture.
