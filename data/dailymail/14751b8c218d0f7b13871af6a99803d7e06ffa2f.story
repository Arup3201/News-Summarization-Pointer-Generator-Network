A three-year-old boy died after a man ‘set fire to a suburban house thinking his ex-girlfriend was inside.’

Local police say Aaron Wilson Dishong, 62, set fire to the two-family home in East Freedom, Pennsylvania, in an attempt to kill his ex, but only two young children and their mother were inside.

Three-year-old Daryl Etchison Jr. was killed in the blaze. Authorities say his mother, Brandy Etchison, jumped from a third-floor window to save herself and her 2-year-old daughter, Madison.

'She is essentially a hero in our opinion,' Blair County Chief Deputy District Attorney

Wade Kagarise told reporters on Thursday night after the incident.

Husband, Darrel Etchison, was at work when the fire broke out, Kagarise said.

A local hospital spokeswoman said MS Etchison remained in critical condition late Thursday. Kagarise said it was his understanding that little Madison was to be released from the hospital.

Mr Dishong allegedly incriminated himself during a phone call with a witness that was monitored by police.

The two witnesses came forward to say Mr Dishong had gone to South Second Street to stalk his ex-girlfriend over the past couple of days and had said he was going to kill her, investigators say.

Mr Dishong’s ex had a protection-from-abuse order against him.

Mr Dishong was jailed Thursday night on homicide, arson and related charges. He denied setting the fire following his arraignment.
