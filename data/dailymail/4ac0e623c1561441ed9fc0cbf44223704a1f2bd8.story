What should have been the holiday of a lifetime soon turned into a personal hell as a serious leg infection while visiting Thailand turned John Capretta's world upside down.  

Capretta, 25, a network engineer from Melbourne, had gone for a two-week holiday in Thailand. But after spending five enjoyable days in Bangkok, an accident on his first day in Koh Pangan island, on Christmas Day, gave him an unwanted present. 

He had gone out with a group of people from a nearby hostel, and when they stopped at a beach he decided to go for a run. It was a decision he would live to regret.   

John Capretta could still manage a smile despite a dislocated right finger and an infected left leg

'I tripped and cut my left ankle on some metal. There were some superficial cuts on my leg and then a deep one, but it wasn't a big deal,' John explained.

'Afterwards I went to a clinic and they sent me to a hospital to get treatment. I came back from the hospital with it bandaged up. They gave me some meds and I was told to keep the wound clean every day, so no problems.'

In the fall John had also dislocated his finger which was now in a splint and it seemed this was going to cause more bother than his leg, however, things soon took a turn for the worse.  

Things didn't look to bad at first but the infection in John's leg just refused to go away 

'Two days later my leg got really swollen. My friends got concerned about it and told me to go to the First Western Hospital - I ended up staying there for two weeks,' John said.

'I didn't feel sick or anything. But when I went back to the hospital, they opened up the wound to have a look and it was all black inside.'

Over the next fortnight John had five procedures on his leg in Thailand including a series of debridements, where they took away the infected tissue.

Even when he arrived back to Australia on January 11 he wasn't out of the woods. He had to have two more surgery procedures at St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne. This included a skin graft because so much infected skin had to be cut out.

Despite a number of surgical procedures the infection kept coming back again and again

'Unfortunately, even after surgery in Thailand, it was still infected. So they had to do two more surgeries a in Melbourne. I was there for a week and a half,' he said.

John can look back now and talk calmly about what he's been through, but at the time it was a very different story.  

'The most scary thing was that they told me in hospital in Thailand that they'd only have to cut out all the infected area and I'd be fine. But every time they did that when they'd check my leg the next day there would still be infection there.

' At one stage I did think 'Am I going to lose my leg or something?' The thought did cross my mind. But you have to stay positive.'

After five days in Bangkok John's holiday was going well until he got a Christmas present he'll never forget 

'But it was worrying because it as like it was an invincible bacteria and just kept coming back. At that point when it kept coming back it was a pretty scary period. Something very minor just got out of control.'

Fortunately John is nearly back to full health but still has to have his leg checked regularly.

'These checks are just precautionary,' he said. 'It won't put me off travelling.' 

And the one other crucial thing he learned about the whole experience - if you go on holidays always have travel insurance.
