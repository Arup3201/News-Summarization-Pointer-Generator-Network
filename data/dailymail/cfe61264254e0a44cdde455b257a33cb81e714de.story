Swansea have expressed an interest in Montpellier holding midfielder Benjamin Stambouli. 

The 23-year-old also has also been earmarked by Fiorentina.

Garry Monk has already signed France striker Bafetimbi Gomis this summer and could move to bring his countryman to Wales, too.  

Wanted: Midfielder Benjamin Stambouli is being courted by Swansea and Italian side Fiorentina 

QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt meanwhile, is the subject of a £3million bid from AC Milan.

The Italians will also offer a percentage sell on to the London club.

Taarabt spent six months at the San Siro on loan, but Milan refused to pay the agreed buy-out clause.
