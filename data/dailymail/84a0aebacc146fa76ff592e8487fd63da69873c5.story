His Clean & Lean diet programme has won him fans all over the world, including British supermodel Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley and fellow models Elle Macpherson and David Gandy.

And Australian fitness guru James Duigan, founder of London supergym Bodyism, is now turning his attention to the nation's bingo wings, in the third installment of a video series created exclusively for MailOnline.

Duigan has already revealed how to get a perfectly flat stomach and buns of steel, and now he'll show you how to get arms worthy of Michelle Obama using three simple exercises.

Duigan's three arm-tightening exercises can be done anywhere at any time of day and require no equipment.

The Y is a fantastic way to improve posture and tone arms, simply sweeping them up and down while in a squat position.

The closed-grip push-up from the knee is a half push-up done at a steady pace with a straight back.

And the floor tricep dip also helps tone up legs, stomach and buttocks.

He advises doing 15 of each every morning, all at a steady pace with a straight back.

Common sense: James Duigan's Clean & Lean plan is loved by supermodels and anyone who wants to detox and tone up

First unveiled in a 
book in 2012 called The Clean & Lean Diet, Duigan's health plan has 
now been revised and updated for e-readers, and can be downloaded onto 
Kindles or iPhones and iPads using the Kindle app.

Beloved
by supermodels, Victoria's Secret girls and film stars (Lara Stone and 
Hugh Grant, to name a few) the real magic is that is can work for 
anyone, from housewives to office workers and everyone in between.

The
diet has never been advertised, but those who follow it (and who follow
Duigan's workouts, which he teaches from his London gym Bodyism, 
recently voted top gym by Tatler magazine) become enthusiastic to the 
point of fanaticism, making the Clean & Lean plan popular through 
word of mouth alone.

It recommends fresh food, as close to its natural state as possible. No refined sugar, which Duigan describes as like a 'toxic fat bomb' for your waistline.

Cut back caffeine to one cup of coffee in the morning. Rely on natural, nutritious foods to give you energy rather than a roller coaster of unnatural highs provided by sugar and caffeine that invariably end in a crash that will have you reaching for the next stimulant, whether that be coffee, carbs, sweets or wine.

And yes, ditch the booze.

British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a staunch supporter of James Duigan's Clean & Lean diet plan

Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley met James several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the introduction to his book Clean & Lean: Flat Tummy Fast.

Rosie said: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine.

'What I've learned through working with James is that by focusing on creating a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I ever thought possible. Oh, and by the way, nobody can get a stomach as flat as James can!'

Clean foods are those that:

It's
not just the wrong type of food that piles on the pounds. The 
relentless, low-level stress of everyday life can also add inches to 
your waist.

When we're frightened, angry, tense or worried our bodies become flooded with adrenalin and a stress hormone called cortisol.

The adrenalin keeps us alert and focused, while the cortisol prepares our muscles for a 'fight-or-flight' response.

Does stress leave you feeling fat?

It also helps the body to release sugar into the bloodstream for instant energy.

It's all part of a defence mechanism that allows the body to respond appropriately when faced with danger.

While
this stress mechanism worked well for us when we were cavemen, 
modern-day stress, caused by a relentlessly busy lifestyle, is really 
bad for you.

It makes 
you fat, it wears out your immune system and it increases your risk of 
serious illness. This is because many of the situations that cause 
stress nowadays don't present the sort of physical danger that you need 
to run away from.

The 
result is that fat-storing hormones - and the sugar they help to release
into the bloodstream - float around your system, eventually ending up 
as fat on your tummy and around your waist.

They also make you crave more sugar because your body thinks it needs more to keep going.

As
stress levels subside, your adrenalin levels fall, but cortisol (and 
the resulting blood sugar) stays in the system much longer.

Research
shows that fat cells around the stomach attract cortisol, giving you a 
layer of toxic fat just below your abdominal muscles that's really hard 
to shift, so doing regular sit-ups is pointless if you always feel 
stressed.

And stomach 
fat is the most dangerous type because it raises your risk of heart 
disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain cancers.

Constant stress also shuts down the digestive system because your body redirects blood from there to your muscles.

So stress can leave you constipated, bloated and toxic. Beating stress is the only way to better health and a better body.
