Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has taken a turn for the worse after catching a severe respiratory infection.

A government spokesman announced that the far-left leader was in a 'very delicate' condition in hospital as he continues to battle cancer.

Details of Chavez's health have been cloaked in mystery since he was first diagnosed with the disease in June 2011, but experts say the latest piece of bad news shows his situation is now 'truly precarious'.

Communications Minister Ernesto 
Villegas appeared on national television last night to announce that the
president was suffering from 'a new, severe infection'.

Chavez, 58, has been undergoing 'chemotherapy of strong impact,' Villegas added.

The president has neither been seen 
nor heard from, except for a couple of hospital bed photos, since 
submitting to a fourth round of surgery in Cuba in December for an 
unspecified cancer in the pelvic area.

The government says he returned home on February 18 and has been confined to Caracas' military hospital since.

Villegas said Chavez was 'standing by
Christ and life conscious of the difficulties he faces'. He also took 
the opportunity to lash 
out at 'the corrupt Venezuelan right' for what he called a psychological
war seeking 'scenarios of violence as a pretext for foreign 
intervention.'

He called on Chavez's supporters, who include thousands of well-armed militiamen, to be 'on a war footing'.

If the charismatic president dies a 
snap election will be called, though the opposition argues that it 
should have been held after Chavez was unable to be sworn in on January 
10.

The campaigning has already 
unofficially begun, with Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who Chavez has 
said should succeed him, frequently commandeering all broadcast channels
to promote the 'revolution' and vilify the opposition.

Chavez has run Venezuela for more 
than 14 years as a virtual one-man show, gradually placing all state 
institutions under his personal control. But the former army paratroop 
officer who rose to fame with a failed 1992 coup, never groomed a 
successor with his force of personality.

Chavez was last re-elected in 
October, and his challenger Henrique Capriles, the youthful governor of 
Miranda state, is expected to be the opposition's candidate again.

On state TV last night, opinion show 
host Mario Silva slung the latest volley of mud at Capriles, claiming 
his family had purchased a multi-million-dollar New York City apartment 
with stolen money.

Opposition lawmaker Julio Borges 
condemned Villegas' use of Monday night's health bulletin. 'I lament 
such a poverty of humanity,' he tweeted.

Pro-Chavez militant Enrique Barroso 
said gravely: 'This is not easy for him nor for us. We call on the 
people to pray and hold vigil for the health of the president.'

One of Chavez's three daughters, 
Maria Gabriela, expressed thanks to well-wishers via her Twitter 
account. 'We will prevail!' she wrote, echoing a favorite phrase of her 
father. 'With God always.'

There has been speculation that Chavez's cancer has spread to his lungs and cannot be halted.

An oncologist not involved in 
Chavez's treatment, which has been conducted in tightly enforced 
secrecy, said that he viewed Villegas' statement as recognition that 
Chavez's condition is 'truly precarious'.

He called into question the veracity 
of Villegas' statement that Chavez had been undergoing chemotherapy, 
saying patients in such a delicate state are not put on chemotherapy.

Maduro said last week that the president had begun receiving chemotherapy around the end of January.

Doctors have said that such therapy 
was not necessarily to try to beat Chavez's cancer into remission but 
could have been palliative, to extend Chavez's life and ease his 
suffering.

While in Cuba, Chavez suffered a 
severe respiratory infection that nearly killed him. A tracheal tube was
inserted then and government officials have said his breathing remained
laboured.
