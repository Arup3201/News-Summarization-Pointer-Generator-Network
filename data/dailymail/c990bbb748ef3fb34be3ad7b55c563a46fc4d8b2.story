A Muslim activist has labelled Islamic State militants 'w**kers' and says teenagers who travel to Syria to join the terror group deserve to be 'locked up'.

Zaky Mallah, from Sydney, made the comments during an appearance on Channel Ten's The Project.

Mr Mallah was the first person to be charged with terrorism back in 2003 after he made a video which Federal Police and ASIO said contained a planned suicide attack on federal government offices in Sydney.

Muslim activist Zaky Mallah, from Sydney, called Islamic State militants 'wankers' and says teenagers who join the terror group deserve to be 'locked up'

He spent two years in the maximum security Multi-Purpose Unit at Goulburn prison awaiting trial, before being acquitted.

Mr Mallah's comments come one day after a propaganda video for Islamic State featuring Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir surfaced.

Earlier this year, the 17-year-old disappeared from his Bankstown home in June, telling his mother he was going fishing. 

On Wednesday night, The Project's Carrie Bickmore asked Mr Mallah what he would say to teenagers looking to travel to the conflict zone.

The activist said he would 'discourage them' from joining the beheading extremist group and urged them to think about what they were doing to their families, and took aim at Islamic State.

'These idiots, these wankers [IS fighters]... are giving Islam and the Muslim world and Islamic community in Australia a bad name,' Mr Mallah told The Project.

'For those who are considering to join ISIS, I hope ASIO is onto you.

'I hope your passport is refused and I hope you are arrested and locked up until you wake up to yourself and realise the harm you are doing to the community and greater Australia.'

Mr Mallah said using social media as a recruitment tool was why it seemed like more teenagers were taking action and travelling to the Middle East.

'With social media and YouTube, there's a lot of ISIS videos – it's like hardcore porn – a person gets interested in such footage, black banners running around and you see people from all around the world coming together for a cause,' he said.

'A lot of these people in Islamic community see this and say "Why not?" and before you know it, they're at the airport flying making their way to Turkey and then they're at the border ready to cross into Syria.'

Mr Mallah was the first person to be charged under the Australian terror laws in 2003, but was acquitted

Having made his way to Syria himself in 2012 to fight with Free Syrian Army rebels, Mr Mallah said it was 'very easy' to get into the country - all you had to do was pay $50 and someone was more than willing to help you.

Mr Mallah told Daily Mail Australia that all he wanted was to see Syria free from Bashar al-Assad's regime.

'I know the Islamic community in Sydney, we’re very passionate,' he said. 

'The Sunni Muslim community wants to get rid of Bashar al-Assad.'

Mr Mallah said Australia's Syrian community wanted to go over to the Middle East and fight but it was illegal for them to do so.

'Maybe Australian authorities can let us go over and fight as long as we don't join ISIS,' he said.

'ISIS is the most brutal group and people think joining it will help.'
