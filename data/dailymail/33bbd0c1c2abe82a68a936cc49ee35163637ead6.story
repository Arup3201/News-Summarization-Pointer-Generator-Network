If Lupita Nyong’o had a night to remember at the Oscars then the same can surely be said of her brother Peter who accompanied her to the ceremony and not only got a name check during her emotional acceptance speech but also audaciously photobombed the star-studded selfie that has become the most retweeted ever.

The epic selfie that broke Twitter features the crème de la crème of Hollywood royalty including Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep and Bradley Cooper - and there rubbing shoulders with them all is Peter Feliz Anyang' Nyong'o, a first year student at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida.

Peter, a younger brother and one of the Oscar-winning actress' five siblings, has without a doubt just had a weekend that he will never forget after accompanying his sister on Sunday night's red carpet.

When Lupita rose to give one of the evening’s most emotional acceptance speeches for best supporting actress for 12 Years A Slave, he got an emotional name check.

Close to tears, she called him ‘Junior’ and described him as her ‘best friend.’

Afterwards when quizzed about his appearance in the star-studded snapshot, she laughed and said, ‘I think that's his win for sure.’

‘He got into the most famous selfie in the world. I'm glad I could have facilitated that.’

Peter is a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences at Stetson. He enrolled in fall 2013 and has not declared a major yet, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

At college he too has shown an interest in acting and last September appeared as part of an ensemble cast in an event called An Evening Of Improv. He's also a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity at the school.  

In the famous Oscar night selfie, Nyong'o is positioned prominently on the right, cheekily blocking Angelina Jolie and his sister.

'Lupita Nyong'o's brother got prime real estate,' said Sherri Shepherd on Monday's The View.

While older sister Lupita was born in Mexico City while their parents were in political exile in 1983, the family had long since moved back to Nairobi, Kenya, when Peter was born in the early 1990s.

By then, their father Peter Snr had 
become part of the country's senate, while their mother Dorothy had 
taken a leadership position with the Africa Cancer Foundation.

The six Nyong'o children were raised in what has been described as ‘middle class, suburban’ environment.

Until
 last year Peter was a student at St Andrews, one of East Africa's elite
 boarding schools and described as an international, multicultural, 
Christian Boarding School offering a British Curriculum education of the
 highest standard.

On his Facebook page, Peter has wasted no time in posting the iconic selfie of him hanging with the Hoolywood elite, while his profile picture is a touching photo of him posing with his famous sister.

His profile reveals that has spent time working at Hebron, a Chrisitian school in Tamil Nadu, India and his interests include a love of the British soccer team Arsenal and a rap group, The Flat 4 -1, that he launched with some friends while at school.

Now as Peter returns to Florida and to his studies he has a priceless memento of a night never to forget - that iconic selfie engineered by Oscar host Ellen DeGeneres.
