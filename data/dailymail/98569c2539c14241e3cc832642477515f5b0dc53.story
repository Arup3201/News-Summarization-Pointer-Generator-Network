A pair of jets at New York's LaGuardia Airport got a little too close for comfort Tuesday morning, with one ripping the wingtip off the other. 

American Airlines Flight 1104 from Dallas was taxiing to its gate just before 11am as Southwest Airlines Flight 449 to Denver was departing.

The left winglet — a vertical fin at the tip of a wing designed to improve airflow and fuel efficiency — was sheared off the Southwest plane after it made contact with the American jet's left horizontal stabilizer, part of the tail. Both planes were Boeing 737s. No passengers on either plane were injured.

American spokesman Joshua Freed said in an email that the airline's plane 'was taxiing with the help of ground personnel walking near each wingtip.'

The 143 Southwest passengers and five crew members exited the jet via stairs and were then taken by bus off the tarmac. 

The aircraft was taken out of service for inspection and repairs. Southwest is finding alternative ways to get the passengers to their destination, according to spokesman Brad Hawkins.

Arí Isaacman Astles, a growth strategy editor at the New York Times, was aboard the stricken Southwest plane and tweeted a photo showing an airport employee carrying the sliced-off piece of the wing across the rainswept tarmac.

The American plane, with 143 passengers and six crew members, made it to gate D7 and passengers left the aircraft via the jet bridge. The return flight to Dallas has been delayed at least 3 hours.

The Southwest jet moved out of the taxiway on its own power, according to Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport. 

Marsico said there are no other delays because of this accident and that the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating
