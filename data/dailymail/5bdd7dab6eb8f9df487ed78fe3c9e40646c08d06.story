A woman got more than what she bargained for when she was given a replacement suitcase at Sydney airport after her luggage was damaged on her flight.

The lady discovered 230g of a plastic explosive in a suitcase on Tuesday which had been  hidden in an unclaimed suitcase used by police officers for canine training exercise almost a month ago on August 14. 

The Australian Federal Police has been forced to apologise for the embarrassing and potentially dangerous mishap, however officers say the device was not live. 

But the drama didn't end there for the shocked passenger, who immediately took the luggage to the Cessnock Police Station, two hours north of Sydney, where officers temporarily evacuated the building as a safety precaution.

AFP Sydney Airport Commander Wayne Buchhorn has apologised to the travelling public and all those involved in the unusual incident.

'The AFP takes this error seriously and the canine instructor who inadvertently left this device behind has been identified and will be the subject of a formal Professional Standards Investigation,' Commander Buchhorn said.

'Although the travelling public was not in danger at any time, we regularly review our processes in this area, and we will do again in the light of this incident.'

'This type of training is essential for our canine teams, allowing the dogs to experience potential threats in a real environment,' he said.

'On behalf of the AFP, I would like to thank the woman, her family and New South Wales Police, especially officers at Cessnock Police Station, for their assistance in this matter.'
