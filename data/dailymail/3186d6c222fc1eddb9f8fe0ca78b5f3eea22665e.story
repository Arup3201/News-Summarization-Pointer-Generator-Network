If you’ve ever wanted to see a shipwreck up close in real time, now’s your chance.

Over the next week the Hercules Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) will be exploring a section of the Gulf of Mexico home to a sunken German U-Boat and a U.S. passenger ship from World War Two.

And you can watch the vehicle’s exploration of the area live as it also observes brine pools, lakes and deep-water coral reefs, with the channel staying on-air until 9 October.

This mission is just the latest adventure this year for the Nautilus ship and its crew, operated by Ocean Exploration Trust, where users can ask questions directly to the scientists

This neutrally buoyant yellow Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) is the workhorse of the Nautilus Exploration Program.

It is always used in tandem with another remotely operated vehicle, Argus.

Hercules is equipped with six thrusters that allow the pilots to ‘fly’ it in any direction, plus two manipulator arms designed for collecting samples and recovering artifacts.

Video from Hercules' high-definition main camera is streamed up a fiber-optic cable to the control van on Nautilus, then out to the world.

It is capable of operating down to 13,100 feet (4,000 metres).

It has already performed several successful missions and has more scheduled up to 9 October as part of the 2014 Nautilus Expedition.

This particular project is known as ‘Exploring the Unknown America’, during which it may visit up to four shipwrecks.

Of the shipwrecks that might be visited, one is the German U-boat U-166, which sank with all hands on deck in 1942 from depth charges released by American patrol vessel PC-566.

This makes it the only known U-boat to be sunk in the Gulf of Mexico.

The sinking of U-166 followed its own attack on the steam passenger ship Robert E. Lee, which it torpedoed and sent to the bottom of the ocean a few minutes prior.

Of the 270 passengers on the ship, however, 250 of them were saved by PC-566.

The attack on the passenger ship was a result of Germany’s policy of ‘unrestricted submarine warfare’ in World War Two, which saw them target ships of any sort.

The wrecks of the two vessels are just a few miles apart in the Gulf of Mexico.

Wrecks for exploration include the German U-boat U-166 sank and the steam passenger ship Robert E. Lee, both of which sunk in 1942. Other potential sites for exploration include two oil tankers that were also sunk in World War Two by German U-boats, the Gulf Penn and Gulf Oil

The Hercules remotely operated vehicle is preparing to explore the Gulf of Mexico over the next week including several shipwrecks, one being the German U-boat U-166 (gun shown). This sank with all hands on deck in 1942 from depth charges released by American patrol vessel PC-566

Other potential sites for exploration by the Hercules include two oil tankers that were also sunk by German U-boats in World War Two, the Gulf Penn and Gulf Oil.

These tankers are particularly interesting because they have a high number of large corals growing on them.

The mission will be run from the Corps of Exploration’s flagship vessel, E/V Nautilus.

It is one of only two dedicated ships of exploration in the world.

The 211-foot (64 metres) ship is equipped with all of the latest in ocean technology and can host a 31 person science team in addition to 17 crew members.

The ship is outfitted for a two-tiered approach to exploration.

First the team uses a multibeam sonar system to map unknown areas of the seafloor.

Once the data is analyzed and targets are chosen, they use remotely operated vehicles to collect video footage and a variety of samples.

Up to the end of 2014 the ship and its crew will continue to explore locations in the Gulf of Mexico and surrounding waters.
