Guilty: Philip Benwell has admitted causing grievous bodily harm to schoolgirl Leila Crofts

A cyclist who left a nine-year-old girl with life-threatening injuries after knocking her down in a hit-and-run collision faces jail over the incident.

Philip Benwell yesterday pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to Leila Crofts by wanton and furious cycling and will be sentenced next month.

The 38-year-old hit the young girl with his bike as she was crossing a zebra crossing with her au pair on July 26.

Leila was knocked unconscious in the collision in Poole, Dorset, and was left fighting for her life in intensive care.

Benwell, who was cycling downhill at the time of the crash, came off his bike but then picked it up and walked off.

Witness Louise Barber had to use the au pair's mobile phone to telephone Leila's mother and inform her of the accident.

She tended to Leila along with lifeguards from the beach before the girl was rushed to hospital.

Mrs Barber, 42, said: 'The au pair couldn't speak English too well and was asking for me to speak to the child's mum on the phone.

'I spoke to her mum and told her I was sorry to say this, but her daughter had been in an accident - it was awful.'

Leila, now aged 10, is recovering well from the crash, and is back at home in Sandbanks with her parents Chanine Boulton, a nursery owner, and IT consultant Darren Crofts.

When police launched an appeal to find the missing cyclist, Benwell, from Bournemouth, handed himself in the day after the incident.

He pleaded guilty to GBH at Bournemouth Crown Court yesterday.

Judge Peter Johnson adjourned sentencing for reports, but told Benwell: 'I regard this as a serious matter and you ought to be aware that custody is very much a possibility in this case.'

The defendant was released on bail on condition that he remain at his home address, and will appear in court again on December 19.
