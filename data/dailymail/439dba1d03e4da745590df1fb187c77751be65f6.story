Police have let another home intruder walk free on the grounds he was drunk and high on drugs when he broke in to a disabled man's house at 3.30am.

John Pearson was woken by his dog barking and was horrified when he realised a stranger had forced his way into his conservatory.

The 59-year-old, who suffers from degenerative disc disease in his spine, chased the younger man out of his semi-detached house and called the police.

Anger: Homeowner John Pearson, who is registered disabled, chased the intruder from his home at 3.30am

Alarmingly, the intruder returned minutes later and tried to get back in but was caught by the police who escorted him off the property in Sturminster Newton, Dorset.

Mr Pearson said when he called the police
 the next day he was shocked to learn they were taking no further action
 against the man because he was drunk and was on drugs at the time.

It is the second similar case involving 
an intruder escaping prosecution on the basis that they were intoxicated at 
the time they entered a stranger's house.

Mr Pearson, a computer programme engineer, claims he was told by officers the man had mistaken the house for his own.

Earlier this week we told how police released another drunk  intruder who had broken into the home of  Tim Ferris, 53

But it is thought the suspect lives in a village nine miles away, although he is believed to have family living about a mile from Mr Pearson's home in Sturminster Newton.

Earlier this week, estate agent Tim Ferris, 53, told of his fury after he trapped a suspected burglar inside his home near Maidstone, Kent, only for the police to later let the man go because he was drunk.

On that occasion, Kent police had seemingly accepted the man's explanation that he had drunkenly mistaken Mr Ferris' house for his own.

Mr Pearson, who was offered £10 compensation following the break in, said he fears there is a worrying trend of people getting away with minor offences on the basis they are drunk.

He said: 'I think people are getting away with things just because they are have been drinking and taking drugs. This is a pattern we are seeing more of.

'If someone was to swear at a police officer they would be arrested but it now seems to me that if you enter someone's property, you get a lift home so long as you have been drinking.'

Mr Pearson lives with his wife Lindsey, their 14-month old son and a 15-year-old foster child.

He said his intruder, who was aged in his 20s, had damaged a wooden fence to climb into his back garden before using a dog flap to enter the property.

Mr Pearson said: 'I came downstairs at about 3.30am when my dog started growling. I was about to go into the kitchen when I saw the man in my conservatory.

'I went out there and started shouting at him and he ran off, so I chased him but couldn't get very far as I'm registered disabled and can't run well.

'I phoned the police and woke up my wife and as I was talking on the phone he reappeared at the back door and tried to get in again, my wife was terrified.

Mr Pearson, 59, who was offered £10 compensation, said he was shocked to learn
 police were taking no further action against the man because he was 
drunk and was on drugs at the time

'I flew outside and he ran off again and straight into the police.

'But when I spoke to them the next day I was appalled to find out he wasn't going to be charged.

'They said he was on ketamine and alcohol and that he thought my house was his own and didn't know what he was doing. They said it wasn't worth charging him.'

Since the incident in February, Mr Pearson has been offered £10 in compensation

from the intruder via the police as part of a 'community resolution' scheme.

Mr Pearson refused the gesture.

A spokeswoman for Dorset police said: 'We dealt with this incident as criminal damage as the level of crime met the criteria for community resolution.

'The level of crime was not of that to be dealt with through the court.

'Mr Pearson was offered £10 in compensation from the man through the police, and the compensation amount is determined on each individual case.

'An inspector who has dealt with this matter spoke to Mr Pearson very recently and at length.

'He explained to him why the decision was made for a community resolution to the crime and why it was not appropriate to charge the offender.

'Mr Pearson was satisfied with the explanation and did not want to pursue any further complaint.'
