You may be forgiven for thinking this image is a 2D painting but it is, in fact, a 3D computer model of an 1885 Hungarian masterpiece.

Graphic designer Zsolt Ekho Farkas created the full 3D rendering using painter Benczur Gyula's battle scene Budavar visszavetele, also known as the Recapture of Budapest.

It took a month to digitally map the scene, and a further five weeks to paint and mask the digital model.

Graphic artist Zsolt Ekho Farkas created the full 3D recreation, pictured, using Hungarian painter Benczur Gyula's Budavar visszavétele, or Buda repossession masterpiece. It began as a challenge from his wife and took a month to model the 32 characters, followed by five weeks spent painting and masking the project

Gyula Benczur was a late 19th century Hungarian painter. He painted the Budavar visszafoglalasa, also known as the Recapture of Budapest, pictured, in 1885 which depicts the siege of the Budapest in 1686. Benczur was renowned for painting portraits of kings and aristocrats

Gyula Benczur was a late 19th century 
Hungarian painter.

He helped paint the Maximilianeum and Rathaus 
frescoes in Munich and commissioned by Bavarian King Ludwig II to paint 
Rococo themes.

Benczur was renowned for painting portraits of kings and aristocrats.

His 1885 painting Budavar visszavetele, also known as the Recapture of Budapest, shows the 1686 siege of Budapest featuring Prince Charles of Lorraine. 

Farkas said: 'This project started as a funny challenge from my wife, but became something more.

'We were on holiday solving riddles, and there was a medieval painting in the booklet.

'My wife asked me if I could [produce] it in 3D?! I said yes, of course. 

Farkas began by analysing a high-resolution copy of Benczur's painting he found on Wikipedia, before plotting the positions of each character in 3D on his home computer. 

He started modelling characters using what’s called a full rig that could be moved and animated, but admitted his PC could only handle these animations for up to nine of the 32 characters.

Using static modelling techniques Farkas plotted each of the characters, pictured, on so-called displacement maps that are used to showcase depth and height. Once all of the characters were plotted, Farkas rendered colours in the images using the digital copy of the painting

Instead, he resorted to detailed, static modelling techniques and plotted each of the characters on so-called displacement maps that are used to showcase depth and height.

Once all of the characters were plotted, Farkas rendered colours in the images using the digital copy of the painting.

He then had to repaint sections of the characters that were obstructed using a clone stamp tool that copied and transferred colours from other regions of the rendered painting.

To create the smoke effect, Farkas filmed footage of smoke using a camera and two LED lights.

This footage was uploaded and stills from it were added to the model using a mask layer.

The project began as a challenge from Farkas' wife and took the Hungarian graphic designer a month to model the 32 characters. This was then followed by five weeks spent painting and masking the project. The different masks and rendering processes are pictured

The modelling took a month to complete, while the painting and masking took an extra five weeks.

‘During the creation I made a few bad decisions, but it was extremely useful and instructive,' added Farkas.

‘Seeing this kind of popularity I decided to make another one now I know the obstacles, and the parts that I have to make differently.

'Maybe a 2.5 D version could look better? But I wanted to make it in full 3D; for my wife, and for myself of course.’

The full step-by-step process can be found on Farkas' blog in Hungarian, and an English version is available from Behance.
