A food nut has lost six stone by beating her addiction to peanut butter - at the height of her dependence, she was getting through an incredible 2lbs of it every week.

Each week 19st Dee McKenna, 48, of Bovingdon, Hertforshire, finished a giant jar of her favourite extra-crunchy Skippy peanut butter packed with 6,000 calories - equal to 12 Big Macs.

And that count doesn't include the doorsteps of tiger bread she smeared the sticky treat onto for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Size 24 Dee kicked the peanut habit and in seven months slimmed down to 13st - and the weight is still falling off. She now wears a dress size 14.

She said: 'I loved peanut butter - I bought a 2lb jar every week at the supermarket and sometimes I would run out before my next shopping trip.

'To me it was an addiction as bad as smoking. People used to think I was nuts.

'I knew it was very high in calories but that's why it was so satisfying to eat.

'I loved it spread on big, thick slices of tiger bread - I could get through half a loaf in a sitting.

'I'd never let tiger bread go stale.'

She became so big her pet Labradors Woody and Jake rarely got taken out for walks.

Dee said: 'One day the dogs watched me stuffing my face.

'They were drooling but it was then I realised that the weren't the disgusting ones, I was.

'I threw it in the bin and started crying. That was the moment I decided to do something about my waistline.'

She decided to join Lighterlife, and two months later encouraged her husband Dean, 45, to join her.

Weighing in at 20st, he frequently indulged in fast food from his workplace, McDonald's.

The pair, who have been married for 15 years and have no children, embarked on a strict diet of special low-calorie milkshakes through Lighterlife.

Between them the couple lost 13st in just seven months.

Dean now weighs in at 14st and has quit his job at McDonalds to become the director of his own consultancy.

Meanwhile Dee is now a counsellor for Lighterlife, running her own groups in High Wycombe.

She said: 'When we joined the slimming group the leader thought I was Dean's mother because I looked so old.

'Now I am a svelte size 14 and I'm hoping to get down a bit further.

'We both feel fabulous and realise how much fun life can be.

'I don't miss peanut butter at all - although I still like the smell of it!'
