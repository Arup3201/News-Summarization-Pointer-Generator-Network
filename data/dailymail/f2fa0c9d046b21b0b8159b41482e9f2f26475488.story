Worries: Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured yesterday outside 10 Downing Street) admitted he fears online porn could harm his children

David Cameron yesterday admitted he fears online porn could harm his children.

The Prime Minister says he worries when any of his three children ‘grab hold of the iPad’ because they risk seeing obscene images.

‘The world has changed so fundamentally with the internet that we’ve got some real threats there to our children and also from this appalling scourge of child pornography,’ he said. ‘We’ve got to take a lot of action.’

Mr Cameron is now pledging to ‘put the heat’ on web firms, making them do more to remove illegal child abuse images and protect children from legal porn.

At a summit tomorrow, ministers and charities will demand action from internet service providers. TalkTalk and BT announced at the weekend that customers trying to view child sex abuse sites would be confronted with a pop-up warning.

The ‘splash pages’ are aimed at deterring paedophiles such as Mark Bridger, who killed five-year-old April Jones after accessing sickening online material.

Maria Miller, who is hosting the summit, is expected to ask other operators to follow suit.

The Culture Secretary said: ‘These firms have an enormous responsibility to make sure our children are protected in the best way possible. Tackling this problem is not easy when technology changes and adapts at such a fast pace.

‘But I am determined to do all I can – and to encourage industry to do all it can – to put an end to it.

‘I will say that things need to change, that enough is enough, and when I do my children will be at the forefront of my mind, as they always are.’

Mr Cameron said there was no doubt that internet companies needed to do more on online pornography – the subject of a Daily Mail campaign.

On the issue of child abuse images, he told Sky News: ‘I’m not satisfied that internet companies do enough to help take them down.

‘That’s why we’re having this round table in government with them to really put the heat on, [to ask them to] work with the police, work with us so we can get these images off the internet and prosecute those who put them there.

‘As a parent I worry, and I know people watching this programme worry massively, about what our children can get to see when they grab hold of our iPad or log on to the internet.

‘There we need to make more progress of this issue of explaining to everybody that we want to have better filters that parents can switch on to stop access to certain sites and material.’

Mr Cameron hailed the fact that web companies have pledged to introduce clean public wi-fi, so youngsters will not be at risk of seeing porn at a Starbucks.

His remarks came as a poll found a majority of the public were in favour of making search engines such as Google put automatic filters on adult sites.

Fifty-four per cent believed the firms should no longer automatically provide links when people search for pornography sites. The YouGov survey of almost 1,900 people also found that women were strongly in favour of curbs on web porn.

Seventy per cent want Google to automatically filter out porn – compared with 38 per cent of men.

Last night a spokesman for the End Violence Against Women coalition said: ‘The poll shows many people, women in particular, recognise the damaging impact of pornography on children and want action.

‘We cannot continue to shrug our 
shoulders about this huge cultural harm to our society. We are calling 
on politicians of all parties to act.’

At the weekend, Google responded to 
criticisms it was not doing enough by announcing that it will make 
£3million available to tackle child porn, including the establishment of
a global database of child abuse images, making it easier to delete 
them from the web.

The firm is also offering more than £1million to independent software developers to produce tools to combat child porn.

It comes on top of the £1million funding announced last week for the Internet Watch Foundation, which flags up illegal images.

Google lets parents switch on a SafeSearch facility to filter out offensive material.

But parents must turn it on themselves by clicking on the ‘settings’ icon at the top of the rage – it does not come on automatically.

Scott Rubin, Google’s director of public policy, added: ‘We don’t rely simply on filtering technology to block child abuse images; we go beyond that.

‘Any implication that we aren’t doing anything, or we refuse to be part of removing this material, is wrong.’
