The coin was tossed and I was sent to Anfield where the title could have ended up. But didn’t. It didn’t stop the fans giving us 'visitors' the usual atmosphere before and after the game.

You don’t need to have played the game to realise that defensively the Reds haven’t got it quite right yet. But are all their defenders no good? Was Simon Mignolet part of the problem? And the celebration of Steven Gerrard’s deeper role doesn’t take into account the possibility that change might have weakened the team defensively.

So let’s assess those points. Bear in mind that Liverpool want to get even better – they’ve had an excellent season, but Brendan Rodgers won’t want to stand still.

Safe hands? Simon Mignolet is an excellent shot-stopper, but his distribution needs work

An own goal put Newcastle in front, Yoan Gouffran should have made it two when he burst clear, and even when the visitors had players sent off there were times when the Liverpool back four looked like they could crack at any moment. Why?

Rodgers plays a 4-3-3 as his preferred tactic, and two of that back four are attack-minded fullbacks. If that system is going to work, you need at least one world class centre half, ideally two.

Daniel Agger and Martin Skrtel don’t fit the bill in my view – not for the domestic and European glory Liverpool should be aspiring to. You can get away with one of them over a season but not both, not if you want to be champions. I’m sure most Liverpool fans would agree when I say they still haven’t replaced Jamie Carragher. 

Mignolet has had a decent season, I don’t think goalkeeper is a position that Rodgers needs to address. It’s that defence.

Jon
 Flanagan has had an unexpectedly brilliant season and shouldn’t be 
discarded; but I suspect Glen Johnson’s 11 minutes from hell at Crystal 
Palace will have set alarm bells ringing at Anfield.

Calamintous: Glen Johnson (No 2) was found wanting as Crystal Palace scored three goals in nine minutes to derail their title charge

Leader: Vincent Kompany clutches the Premier League trophy for the second time in three years

If you look at why Man City pipped Liverpool to the title, it isn’t because Gerrard slipped over, or because City have rich owners – only the most shallow and basic football debaters would think that.

It’s because they had some superb players, led by the main man at the back – the kind of central defensive rock most successful teams have.

Vincent Kompany showed everyone what a quality footballer and leader he is during the run-in. Without him you always felt City were weaker.

He’s so brilliant he’s even made Martin Demichelis looked good.

If Liverpool can go and find a Kompany, they have a chance of firmly establishing themselves back at the very top level where their fans feel they belong.

Good luck finding him though.

This is a manager who headbutted an opposition player on the touchline during a game.

So a disciplinarian he is not.

A point highlighted by the fact he shook Shola Ameobi’s hand when the striker was sent off, and patted Paul Dummett on the head when he saw red.

Regardless of whether these two players deserved to go (I thought the Dummett red was ridiculously harsh) the manager has to deal with that situation better when he’s the most public face and figurehead of a football club.

Ameobi was barking non-stop at the referee which is why he saw a second yellow, so is Pardew happy with that?

And
 while Dummett shouldn’t have gone in my view, his foul was cynical and 
worthy of a yellow. Is Pardew patting him on the head for that reason?

No self-discipline: Alan Pardew (right) protests at Anfield as a miserable season ends in defeat for Newcastle

Whatever he says to the players in the privacy of the dressing room, the manager of Newcastle United cannot be seen to be condoning ill-discipline on the touchline, especially given his actions earlier this season.

There are some positives to Pardew’s management – when his teams are playing well they are a joy to watch. He achieved good things at West Ham, and Reading before that.

But after a disappointing spell at Southampton, he has been given a fantastic opportunity at a club with huge potential.

He’s not making the most of his incredible good fortune to be in the hotseat at St James’ Park. His reputation right now is that he is a manager with no self-discipline. He’s setting that tone for his players, too, it seems.

Has it been a good season for referees or not?

They get the blame from managers who want to deflect from their own errors of course, so a lot of the things they’re criticised for aren’t actually legitimate.

I’d rather talk about football than referees, but my one criticism of the men in the middle this season is that I’ve seen too many who simply do not watch the game closely enough.

Phil Dowd was the referee at Anfield on Sunday and for me he summed up the problem with referees this season.

I think he is one of the better refs and actually I don’t think he had a bad game.

The man in black: Phil Dowd brandishes red to Paul Dummett

But I don’t know what he saw in the Dummett challenge to regard that as a straight red, rather than a yellow. It wasn’t a clear goalscoring opportunity, it wasn’t serious foul play – studs weren’t high, he wasn’t airborne and out of control – so I just can’t understand what Dowd saw in that incident. What was he watching?

Dowd’s other fault was that he was too willing to 'buy' free kicks won by Raheem Sterling. I like Sterling a lot, and some would call it clever when mid-chase with ball at feet, he will 'bump' into the opponent tracking him – he throws a shape which necessitates contact with his man and goes down.

He did it for the free kick that led to the winning goal. It’s surprising Dowd didn’t watch it properly, if he had he wouldn’t have been deceived.

If it was my club I wouldn’t be bothered about Sterling 'winning' free-kicks – we all know how the heart rules the head when it comes to football.

So if Sterling does it for England, good luck to him! But if he doesn’t win a free kick, that will be a referee doing his job properly.

Dowd also had no reason to disallow Luis Suarez’s brilliant early free kick: he wasn’t even looking so he couldn’t possibly know the ball was rolling, if indeed it hadn’t stopped moving by the time Suarez connected. That was a referee spoiling a special moment in a game because he wasn’t watching what was going on; instead he was too busy being mates with a Newcastle player and having a chat.

Simple advice for refs – watch the game closely. You’ll make fewer mistakes.

There was something very fitting when, with Liverpool lacking the craft and guile to get back on level terms with Newcastle, Suarez running around like a headless chicken, and pot shots reigning in from 30 yards going nowhere, up stepped the Liverpool captain yet again to drag his team to victory.

Steven Gerrard is a stunning player.

His set-piece delivery is still way ahead of anyone else in the Premier League, and his free-kicks led the Reds to victory.

Well into his thirties, Gerrard has this season captained a team that has gone from seventh to second, he has excelled in a new position, helped instill discipline into Suarez, and been the perfect example of a brilliant captain.

He also skippered his country to World Cup qualification unbeaten, and scored the goal to seal a trip to Brazil in the final group game.

So near and yet so far: Steven Gerrard saw his Premier League title dream shattered

Put all of those things together and Liverpool don’t get close to second spot without him. That’s why he pips Suarez for me. And too many bandwagon-jumpers started shouting about Yaya Toure once they realised City were going to win the title.

Toure has had another excellent season and made a massive contribution to City’s title success.

But you can’t be player of the season if your manager sees fit to take you off for tactical reasons when you only have a slender lead at Everton. The fact that City held on to their advantage means the manager was right, and Toure wasn’t needed. That would never happen with Gerrard.  I hope Gerrard’s imperious form continues to the World Cup.

I sense people foaming at the mouth and dribbling on their keyboards muttering: 'What about when he slipped over and gave the ball to Demba Ba?' Everyone can make a mistake, but the saddest part of that is not that it cost Liverpool the title, but that it really is all Chelsea have got to celebrate this season.
