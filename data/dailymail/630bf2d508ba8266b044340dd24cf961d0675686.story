Sunderland striker Danny Graham is refusing to hide as he attempts to end his goal drought.

The 29-year-old frontman is yet to open his account in 20 appearances for the club, but has forced his way back into contention in recent weeks and is desperate to address that situation.

Graham told the Sunderland Echo: 'It would be massive [to get that first goal]. Obviously, as a striker you want to be scoring goals and doing well for your football club, but that's not been the case so far for me.

'I know that, I'm not going to hide. It's up to me to work hard and make sure I get in the positions and not shy away from an opportunity when it comes my way.

'Once one goes in, I'm sure a lot more will follow. The first goal would be nice, but the most important thing is the team - we need to pick up points and make sure we're not going to struggle come the end of the season.'

Former Middlesbrough trainee Graham arrived at the Stadium of Light in a £5million switch from Swansea in January 2013 under then-manager Martin O'Neill, but having failed to find the back of the net in 13 appearances at the end of that campaign, during which the Northern Irish boss was relieved of his duties, he became surplus to requirements.

The former Swansea striker's £5million move hasn't worked out so far, with no goals to show 

Indeed, he spent the whole of last season on loan, initially at Hull and then Boro, and joined Wolves on a similar basis for two months earlier in the current campaign.

However, his return in January and the subsequent arrival of Jermain Defoe have given him a new lease of life on Wearside, and he is relishing the prospect of competing with Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham to partner the England international once the newcomer shakes of a calf injury.

Graham said: 'We're all starting from the same place. All four strikers will be playing at different times and we all bring different things to the team.

'But Jermain has given everyone around the place a lift. You can see that if he gets one chance, he will more than likely put it away and that's what we've been missing.

'To have a player of his calibre at the football club is massive and it's going to help us. Everyone wants to play up front with him and help him and the team do well.'

Graham feels that January signing Jermain Defoe has given Sunderland a lift - and he wants to play with him
