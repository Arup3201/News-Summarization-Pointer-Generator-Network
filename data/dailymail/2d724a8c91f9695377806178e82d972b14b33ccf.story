A schoolboy has been found dead by his grandfather months after his mother died of cancer.

The family of William Smith, 14, is in shock after he died at home in Immingham, Lincolnshire, on Saturday, August 9 and believe it was a prank gone wrong.

His death came five months after his mother Alison Overton, 39, lost her battle with leukaemia.

His grief-stricken father believes his son's death is a 'freak accident' and he was playing a joke on his grandmother.

Paramedics from East Midlands Ambulance Service rushed the teenager to Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital, Grimsby, but he could not be revived.

A post mortem examination was carried out at a hospital in Sheffield and it revealed he died from hanging.

Grimsby and North Lincolnshire coroner Paul Kelly has opened and adjourned his inquest.

His father Dean said that he believed William did not mean to hang himself and that it was a 'tragic accident'.

William's grandfather had gone to check on his grandson when he discovered him.

He said: 'I think it was a silly prank. He said the way he was it looked like a freak accident.

'He was making plans and he was looking forward to Christmas. In my heart he did not mean to do what he did.'

He added there were no notes left by his son at the family home, where he also lived with his two brothers Samuel and Alfie.

'He would have let me know if that had been on his mind. I am not ashamed of him. I love him,' he said.

'I know he did not leave me that way. I just want people to know that I believe it was an accident and he didn't take his own life.'

His mother Alison Overton died in hospital in Leeds in March after an 18-month battle with leukaemia.

William was among relatives who followed her funeral cortege, led by a horse-drawn carriage.

Dean, William, Samuel and Alfie wore button holes, as the couple had been due to get married in the church where the funeral service took place.

Dean wrote on a memorial page: 'My lovely boy, forever in my heart, my soul, my life. No words can say how much I will miss you son.

'You are my first child, my miracle boy. I loved you from the first time you opened your eyes and always will. Sleep well son and keep my love with you as I always will. Yours love, your dad.

'Look after him now Ali you have your miracle with you again.'

The heartbroken father said he had attended the release of sky lanterns at Roval Drive park last week when hundreds of people paid tribute to the 'amazing and brilliant' Oasis Academy Immingham schoolboy.

He said: 'He has made me so proud that in his terrible passing he has brought a whole community together in love and respect.'

He told how he had visited the hospital where the post mortem was carried out and sat talking to his son about the many tributes to him.

Dean said: 'He looked as if he was fast asleep and I talked and talked.'

Relatives are now planning a funeral at the same church where a service was held five months ago for William's mum - Trinity Methodist Church, in Pelham Road, Immingham.

His son, a keen Liverpool supporter will be carried in a red coffin.

He said: 'We will all be wearing Liverpool strips. I know he will be looking down on me laughing because I am a massive Wolves fan and would never wear a Liverpool strip. But I am doing it for him.'

William's family have asked people to make donations towards Sheffield Children's Hospital.

They asked mourners to wear football strips or bright colours to the funeral next Wednesday.
