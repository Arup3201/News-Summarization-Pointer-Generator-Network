More than half of babies are now born to mothers aged over 30, a report revealed yesterday.

And one in five had mothers over 35, according to a breakdown of official data from the Office for National Statistics.

The increasing age of motherhood means that the number of women having families in their late 30s or older could soon overtake those under 25.

Overall 20 per cent of births were to mothers aged 35 or over, the new study from the Office for National Statistics said

It follows decades in which women have increasingly chosen to follow career and education opportunities and put personal ambition ahead of marriage and children.

As a result, most babies born last year will have a mother in her 40s by the time they go to secondary school.

At the same time a sharp drop in young mothers will mean fewer than one secondary school child in 20 will have a mother still in her late 20s in a decade’s time.

The ONS report also showed a growing divide between the lifestyles of the new majority group of older mothers and those who still opt to have children before 25.

The average age of mothers has risen across the board, notably for the first child reaching 28.1 years

More than two-thirds of older mothers have married and their babies are born into traditional families, the breakdown showed.

But among the diminishing number of mothers in their early 20s, only one in five are married – and the figure was even higher for those under 20.

The report said: ‘Almost all women – 96 per cent – aged under 20 who gave birth in 2013 were not married.

‘In contrast, at ages 30 to 39 the majority of women giving birth were married, with only 32 per cent of births outside marriage.’

Yesterday’s figures showed that 51 per cent of all newborns in England and Wales last year had mothers over the age of 30 – up from an average age of 29.8 in 2012.

The figure has been rising since the mid-1970s, when a woman typically gave birth at an average age of 26.4.

A first-time mother is now typically 28.3 years old.

At the same time, the number of births to women under 25 is falling fast. Just over one in five babies – 148,855 in total – were born to younger women last year – half the number of 40 years ago.

However, the number of births to women over 35 climbed to 140,658 – a level last seen during and following the Second World War at a time of enormous disruption to family lives. The great majority of babies, more than 400,000, were born to women aged between 25 and 39.

The ONS report said the ages of mothers has been rising since 1973, reflecting the increasing number of women who have been delaying childbearing to later ages.

Among the factors said to have influenced decisions over childbirth were ‘the instability of partnerships’.

Births to unmarried women in their 30s have risen slower over the past 20 years than those in their 20s or their 40s.

Overall just under half – 47 per cent – of babies were born outside marriage, compared to more than nine in ten in the early 1960s.
