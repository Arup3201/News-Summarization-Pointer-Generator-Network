A teenager has been locked up for a second time for smacking women’s bottoms in public.

Reece Budgeon followed girls and women into secluded spots in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, before pouncing, leaving them distressed and scared to go out alone.

The 18-year-old targeted his first victim just one month after being released from custody for smacking two other women last year.

His victims included two schoolgirls and a mother pushing her child in a pram.

Derby Crown Court heard Budgeon followed the women before slapping them hard on the bottom and running off.

One woman, who had been walking to work through an industrial estate to work at the time, told police that after the incident she felt nervous walking alone.

The oldest victim, whom he struck in an alleyway, said she initially thought he was going to mug her and that it left her feeling vulnerable and shocked.

But Budgeon, who admitted sexually assaulting six women in February and March, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to 25 months in a young offenders’ institution.

Passing sentence Judge Jonathan Gosling said: ‘You were completely indiscriminate in your choice of women, who ranged in age from 15 to 60.

‘Unlike everyone around you, who sees it as disgusting and perverted, you don’t see anything wrong and you have showed no remorse.’

'These crimes caused a lot of anxiety and distress to your victims.

‘It’s impossible to understand what is going on in your head. What motivates you to commit these serious crimes?

‘Only a month after your release you went on to follow and assault no less than six women in five weeks at a time where you are being intensively supervised.’

Jasmine Kumar, for Budgeon, said: ‘What we have from him is a lack of acceptance and responsibility and no justification of committing these offences.’
