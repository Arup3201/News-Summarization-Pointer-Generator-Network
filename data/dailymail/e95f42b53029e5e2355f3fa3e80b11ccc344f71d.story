Pulitzer prize-winning author Jon Meacham hit another career-defining high this morning with his epic tribute to the Jonas Brothers.

The New Jersey-born boy band are sadly no more after calling it quits on Tuesday following eight years together. In the wake of the momentous event, it wasn't long before media heavyweights weighed in.

Meacham, a former editor of Newsweek, led the charge with a solemn reading of lyrics from the Jonas Brothers' hit song SOS on NBC's Morning Joe.

Sombre occasion: Pulitzer prize winner Jon Meacham paid tribute to The Jonas Brothers who split up on Tuesday with a reading of their hit song SOS

Meacham brought gravitas to the recital, set against a black backdrop, while a montage of the grinning Jonas Brothers in happier times flashed alongside him.

Paying tribute to a pop sensation whose 'time came too soon', Meacham begins: 'SOS - told you I made you dinner plans, for you and me and no one else - that doesn't include your crazy friends.'

The presenter works haltingly through the next few lines, finishing with: 'It's like -  it's as if -  I'm walking on broken glass, better believe I bled, it's a call I will never get. and that's SOS.'

At the end of the reading, another host quips: 'Jefferson couldn't have done it better.'

Meacham is a renowned historian who won the Pulitzer prize for his 2008 biography of Andrew Jackson entitled American Lion. He recently published Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power, which topped the New York Times bestsellers' list.

Millions of fans were left devastated on Tuesday after the Jonas Brothers announced their split.

The New Jersey-born trio - Kevin, 25; Joe, 24, and Nick, 21 - called time on the band amid reports of deep rifts and in the wake of cancelling a 19-city fall tour.
