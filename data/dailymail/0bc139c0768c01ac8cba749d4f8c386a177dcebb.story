Accusations: Tony Blair and other government officials are accused of blocking legal claims that led to the IRA obtaining Semtex which was used to enact deadly attacks

Victims of IRA bombings are threatening to sue former Prime Minister Tony Blair over claims he intervened in their efforts to secure compensation.

Lawyers representing some 200 victims say the former Labour Government was involved in a deal which ended up killing off their legal action against the Libyan Government of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi - which provided the IRA with Semtex.

They say Mr Blair and other Government officials may have ‘connived’ with the Gaddafi regime to block their legal claims.

A spokesman for Mr Blair described the claims as ‘malicious and wrong’.

At the centre of the row is a legal case brought by American victims of IRA terror attacks nearly a decade ago in the US courts, which led to in a compensation award of £1billion.

The victory in the US courts led to the threat of Libyan assets being frozen in that country - just as Gaddafi was attempting to re-join the international community.

The legal case was settled after US President George Bush signed a 2008 law, the Libyan Claims Resolution Act - ensuring payments to all US victims.

However, Britons who had been involved in US class action were not included in the legislation, and so were denied a payout.

An email published by the Sunday Telegraph yesterday showing the British government lobbied President Bush to pass the law and settle the cases.

Lawyers for the British victims say it shows the Government may have been involved in excluding British victims - and accuse former ministers of ‘scandalous and perverse’ actions.

Jason McCue of McCue & Partners, which is representing the victims, said: ‘It’s bad enough being a victim of Semtex bombs supplied by Libya for the Provisional IRA campaign.

'[But] it’s sheer horror then to be informed that the British government and Tony Blair may have connived with Gaddafi to ensure the few brave British victims that justly sued and stood up to the dictator received no compensation from the Libyan,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph

Colin Parry, whose son Tim, 12, died when a Semtex bomb exploded in Warrington town centre, said: 'The whole thing is grubby to say the least.

'It seems to me a complete dereliction of duty on the part of the British government in looking after the rights of British citizens. The Americans managed to get compensation for their citizens.'

Hugh Robertson, a Foreign Office minister, said in a letter to Mr McCue that the Government had ‘lobbied the US to include UK claimants on the list of recipients’ of the payout.

The email is from Sir Vincent Fean, a former ambassador to Libya, and suggested Mr Blair helped broker the agreement between Gaddafi and President Bush.

It was written to Mr Blair’s aides on June 8 2008, two days before a meeting between the former prime minister and Col Gaddafi in Libya.

A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘This persistent attempt, backed by no evidence whatever, to suggest that Tony Blair ‘interfered’ with the terms of compensation is malicious and wrong,’ she said.

‘He has never had anything to do with it and he has never discussed any such terms with President Bush. The email you reference merely expresses government policy of the time which was to reengage with the Libyans after they gave up their WMD programme and chose to cooperate rather than sponsor terrorism.’
