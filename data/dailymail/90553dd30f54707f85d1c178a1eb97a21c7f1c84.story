Behind the bench: U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf keeps a personal blog for his legal musings and his latest post decried scantily-clad female lawyers

A District Judge in Nebraska has written a blog post criticizing the overly sexy way that female judges dress in court.

Judge Richard Kopf's uses his latest post on his personal blog, Hercules And The Umpire, to tell unnerving anecdotes about how he is swayed by legal counsel's hemline length and low-cut blouses.

'In candor, I have been a dirty old man ever since I was a very young man,' the 68-year-old judge writes.

He goes on to degrade an unidentified female lawyer based on her dress sense.

'Around these parts there is a wonderfully talented and very pretty female lawyer who is in her late twenties. She is brilliant, she writes well, she speaks eloquently, she is zealous but not overly so, she is always prepared, she treats others, including her opponents, with civility and respect, she wears very short skirts and shows lots of her ample chest. I especially appreciate the last two attributes,' he wrote.

He then goes on to give another example of an allegedly inappropriately dressed lawyer but this time says that the criticism came to his attention by way of 'the sisterhood' of female law clerks that he works with. He writes that they 'seethed and sneered' at the woman's 'unprofessional' choice of dress.

The judge's proposed solutions for the problem do not help the situation, starting off by writing: 'You can’t win. Men are both pigs and prudes. Get over it.'

Legal mind: Kopf, who was given his lifetime appointment by George H.W. Bush in 1992, wrote about how a lawyer's short skirts and low-cut shirts are the attributes he admires about her most

He finishes by warning women to 'tone it down' if they ever think that female law clerks 'are likely to label you, like Jane Curtain, an ignorant slut,' including a link to a Saturday Night Live skit where Dan Ackroyd hurls the insult at Curtain.

Judge Kopf was appointed to his position by former President George H.W. Bush in 1992.

Because federal judges are appointed for life, he can only leave the bench if he resigns, dies, or is impeached by the House of Representatives after being convicted by the Senate.

Unsurprisingly, the post prompted an immediate backlash and a local columnist for the Omaha World-Herald took him to task, and he immediately wrote a somewhat apologetic if not conciliatory second post.

'If, on balance, you think the post was harmful to the image of the federal judiciary and truly treated women as objects, I am very, very, very sorry for that, but I would ask you to pause and reread it,' he says, addressing columnist Erin Grace.

Back in the day: Nebraska-based Kopf, seen here in 2001, told women 'you can't win. Men are both pigs and prudes. Get over it'

'I hope you will find upon objective reflection that the mockery I make of myself and the hyperbole and somewhat mordant tone I employed, made a point worth considering.'

This is not the first time that the judge has been arguably overly candid on his blog, which he describes as being a place for his musings on ‘the role of the federal trial judge’.

He told Congress to ‘go to hell’ during the government shutdown last fall and included a link to the Urban Dictionary definition of ‘bats***’.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the judge originally wrote in January that he was going to quit blogging, prompting some to think that this latest post was the result of his site being hacked.

Instead, it appears that he decided to saddle back up to the keyboard and has been particularly prolific this week, following the ‘dirty old man’ post with a detailed account of his treatment for stage III classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
