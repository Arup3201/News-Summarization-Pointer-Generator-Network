New hope: Actress Angelina Jolie welcomes a G8 pledge to tackle sexual violence at harm to women in war torn countries in London this afternoon

Actress Angelina Jolie joined forces with Foreign Secretary William Hague as the UK pledged to spend a further £10million on tackling sexual violence and harm to women in war zones.

Jolie, who is a special envoy for the UN Human Rights Council, joined Mr Hague at a meeting of the G8 foreign ministers in London this afternoon to make the commitment.

Mr Hague said the deal was necessary to 'end the treatment of rape and sexual violence as a secondary issue and to put women and women's rights front and centre in conflict resolution.'

The UK's pledge will make up part of an overall £23 million package pledged by the G8 nations.

Half of the money (£5 million) will come from the Foreign Office (FCO), while the other half will come from the Department for International Development (DfID).

Addressing the media after the meeting at Lancaster House, Jolie welcomed the G8 pledge.

She said: 'I have heard survivors of rape from Bosnia to the DR Congo say that they feel that they world simply does not care about them and who can blame them.

'For too long they have been the forgotten victims of war, responsible for none of the harm but bearing the worst of the pain.

'But today I believe their voices have been heard and that we finally have some hope to offer.

'I welcome the long overdue stand the G8 has taken and this landmark declaration.'

Mr Hague said: 'We need to shrink and eradicate safe havens for those responsible for war-zone rape and this is a step towards doing that.'

Landmark: Jolie said that survivors of rape have long been the 'forgotten victims' of war and that the G8 pledge is long overdue

He said that part of the funding would go into training the military to respond to conflict sexual violence.

That training will be extended to peacekeeping groups of other nations..

He added: 'This is an absolutely crucial step, since members of armed forces are often the first to come into contact with survivors and could also have an important role to play in helping to change male attitudes.

'Now that we have put war-zone rape on the international agenda, it must never slip off it again and it must be given even greater prominence.

'Ending the 17th and 18th Century slave trade was deemed impossible and it was eradicated.

'Achieving global action against landmines, cluster munitions, climate change, was thought impossible, yet the world acts on these issues.

'Only two weeks ago we secured an international arms trade treaty, one that many people thought could never be adopted.

'And today we know the facts about sexual violence in conflict and we have the means to address it, so we must not look away or rest until the world faces up to its responsibilities to eradicate this violence.'

Mr Hague and the actress, flanked by the other G8 nations foreign ministers were also joined on stage by Zainab Bangura, the Special Representative for the UN on sexual violence in conflict.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'Britain will not stand on the sidelines while so many are denied the chance to reach their full potential and live safe, happy lives.

'We know that girls and women are at their most vulnerable at times of conflict or humanitarian disaster but we need to know what works best to tackle the terrible, often sexual, violence they face.'

The group of foreign ministers also said that they were appalled at the estimated 70,000 deaths during the two year civil war in Syria.

US Secretary of State John Kerry met with Syrian opposition leaders in London yesterday to discuss ways to step up non-lethal aid to the rebels.

But no mention was made of helping the rebels in a military capacity, with opinion on how to address the Syria conflict divided among the G8 nations.

The ministers reaffirmed 'their commitment' to supporting a political transition in Syria and condemned the ongoing use of heavy weapons against residential areas.

'The humanitarian situation in Syria is deplorable and continues to worsen,' the communique said, urging greater humanitarian assistance and improved access to the Syrian people.

Britain and France have been pushing for the European Union to lift or amend its arms embargo on Syria so weapons can be sent to rebel fighters.

Mr Hague said earlier this week that no decisions have been made on whether the U.K. will allow the embargo to expire as scheduled on June 1, effectively clearing the way to arm the rebels.

He said if the situation in Syria continues to deteriorate, there will be a "strong case" for amending or lifting the arms embargo.

The communique also condemned North Korea's aggressive rhetoric and the development of its nuclear missile programs, saying that Pyongyang's recent actions threaten international security.

Their statement came just hours after North Korea delivered a fresh round of rhetoric with claims it had 'powerful striking means' on standby for a missile launch and amid speculation that it is preparing to test a medium-range missile during the country's upcoming national celebration.
