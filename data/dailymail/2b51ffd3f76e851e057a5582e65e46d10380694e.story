Leaving home has always been an important milestone in a person's life and a sign that an individual has entered adulthood.

But now a new life stage called 'emerging adulthood' has been coined to cope with the trend for young people flying the nest later in life.

The reasons for 'emerging adults' staying at home includes a diminishing number of blue-collar jobs, expensive housing and an increasing need for extended studies, but scientists believe the phenomenon means people in their twenties are experiencing an extended period of youth.

Research by Concordia's Department of Applied Human Sciences, Canada, said moving out can constitute a 'crisis' for young adults but parents are best placed to provide practical help (pictured) as well as emotional support and a financial safety net

Just over 42 per cent of adults aged 20 to 29 still lived with their parents in 2011, according to a census from Statistics Canada, compared to 32 per cent ten years earlier and 27 per cent in 1981.

People in their early 20s are now labeled as millennials who are experiencing 'emerging adulthood' - a new life stage that has not affected previous generations, Science Daily reported.

Research by Concordia's Department of Applied Human Sciences in Montreal, Canada, said that moving out can constitute a 'crisis' for young adults and that friends and family play different roles.

A recent report from the Office for National Statistics found that the number of married couples living ‘without dependent children’ has risen by 200,000 since 2003.Although this includes childless couples, the ONS said the increase is due to the growth in homes  with adult children, who are too old to be classed as ‘dependent’.This means they are over 18, or 16 if no longer in full-time education. One in every 100 homes now has two families, the report found, largely because grown-up sons or daughters who stay with their parents are bringing partners in to live with them.The analysis also said an increasing number of single parents are finding their adult children reluctant to leave home.While more young people crowd in with their parents, the Families and Households report found a rise in middle-aged people living alone.Around 7.7million people now live by themselves and single-person households aged between 45 and 64 have risen by more than a quarter in the past decade.

Professor Varda Mann-Feder, at the university and author of the study in the Canadian Journal of Family and Youth, conducted interviews with 32 'emerging adults' who had left home, or were planning to fly the nest.

The young adults who had already left home, said their parents played an integral role to their successful move as they provided pragmatic help as well as emotional support and a financial safety net.

However, she stressed that friends were just as important to a successful outcome as participants in the study revealed they preferred asking their friends for tips in living autonomously, rather than their parents.

'Emerging adults' still living at home, were 'extremely influenced' by friends and family in relation to their thoughts about leaving home, the study said.

Individuals hoping to move out unsurprisingly talked to their friends who had already made the big move about going it alone and whether it is a good idea.

Parents were  reassured by the ability of their children to tap into theses sources of information and thought it helped prevent their offspring making mistakes.

Professor Mann Felder said: 'This study shows peers continue to play a critical role in development after the teenage years.'

'They provide unique input not available from parents or romantic partners,' she added.
