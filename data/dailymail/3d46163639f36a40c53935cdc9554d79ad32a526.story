World Cup hosts Brazil have set up an epic-looking semi-final clash with Germany after edging out South American rivals Colombia.

Luiz Felipe Scolari's much-fancied team advanced after a frenetic match in Fortaleza ending Colombia's dream run in the tournament's knockout stages.

But the five-time champions have been dealt a hammer-blow after losing star man Neymar who was injured in the clash.

Earlier in the evening, France succumbed 1-0 to their old nemesis Germany in a more subdued affair in Rio de Janeiro.

Meanwhile, with England having flown back home from Brazil after a humiliating 
group stage exit, fans who stayed out to enjoy the rest of the World Cup
 have had to find a second team.

And some have resorted to the unthinkable, supporting Germany in their quarter-final against France in Rio de Janeiro.

Three fans were at the Maracana for the last-8 clash wearing England shirts, but with German flags painted on their faces.

In that game, a goal from Mats 
Hummels was enough to ensure that Germany reached their fourth 
semi-final in a row. They have now not failed to reach the final four 
this century.

An early strike 
by Thiago Silva and a delicious free-kick by David Luiz were enough to 
send Brazil in to the final four, sparking wild celebrations among 
millions of fans.

But amid the euphoria, Brazil's hopes of winning the tournament were dealt a major blow after it was revealed Neymar would play no further part in the contest.

Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari is already expecting to be without the striker for the semi-final against Germany on Tuesday.

Their talisman was taken off on a stretcher three minutes from time and had to be taken to hospital after the match with a back injury.

Neymar had been struggling in the build-up to the all-South American clash with thigh and knee strains but was passed fit to start.

The Barcelona forward has scored four goals in the World Cup but was unable to add to his tally against Colombia before being stretchered off three minutes from the end.

And team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar told local media in Brazil that Neymar will not kick another ball at the finals, expecting his recovery period to be at least four weeks.

'It's not serious in the sense that it doesn't need surgery, but he'll need to immobilize it to recover,' he told SportTV. 'Unfortunately, he's not going to be able to play.'

Brazil will already be without the suspended Silva for the last-four showdown in Belo Horizonte.
