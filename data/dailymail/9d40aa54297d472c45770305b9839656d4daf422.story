A galaxy of stars have spoken out against Scottish independence as a major ‘lovebombing’ campaign was launched ahead of the referendum.

British celebrities from the world of television and sport joined forces for the ‘Let’s Stay Together’ drive, which aims to persuade Scots to vote No in September.

The line-up included former soap stars Ross Kemp, Michelle Collins and Tracey Brabin and TV presenters Trinny and Susannah, Fiona Phillips, June Sarpong and The One Show’s ‘history hunter’ Dan Snow.

Blackadder actor Tony Robinson, One Foot in the Grave star Richard Wilson and Homeland’s David Harewood also declared their support for the Union, and they were joined by well-known pro-UK supporters Eddie Izzard and John Barrowman.

From the sporting world, the campaign has won the backing of Welsh rugby legend Gareth Edwards, Liverpool icon Ian Rush, and multiple Gold-medal winning Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson.

Campaigner Baroness Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, also appears in a video for Let’s Stay Together.

Created by two London-based PR gurus, the campaign has adopted Queen’s You’re My Best Friend as its anthem, and encourages people across the UK to contact their friends and family north of the Border.

It has even suggested a playlist of songs that supporters can listen to on their MP3 players, including We Are Family by Sister Sledge, Let’s Stick Together by Bryan Ferry and Stay By Me by Annie Lennox.

Ross Kemp said his passion for the Union was fuelled by the time he spent a month with the Argylls in Musa Qala in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

“The Let’s Stay Together campaign is badly needed as it gives all of us in the rest of the UK a chance to be heard,” he said.

“I think we are so entwined in each other, we are together and have always been together in many, many ways. So Scotland, please stay with us. Don’t leave us – we love you.”

Fiona Phillips said: “I very much feel British - my husband’s Scottish, my mum was welsh, my dad’s a Yorkshire man. We’re a wonderful mixed family, we’re a dysfunctional family at times, aren’t we all? If independence does happen, then I think we’re all going to realise that we were much better off together.”

Fashion gurus Trinny and Susannah said: “We want to see Scotland – and the hugely lovely Scottish people – stay with us. It’s so right for us all to be together. We know some people in Scotland think that those in the rest of the UK don’t care, but it’s so very, very wrong. Everyone all over Britain cares passionately about Scotland.”

Tony Robinson, who starred as Baldrick in the iconic Blackadder series and is a well-known Labour supporter, said: “As English people we have to realise [the referendum] will have an enormous impact on us. If we were cut off from Scotland it would be to the disadvantage of both countries.”

Comedian Eddie Izzard, another Labour supporter, pleaded ‘Scotland, please don’t go’ and Scots-American actor and singer John Barrowman said: “I’m very proud of my Scottish heritage. My firm belief is Scotland should remain part of Great Britain.”

TV presenter Fiona Phillips said 'Scotland is part of my family' in the video, aimed at persuading voters to reject independence in September's referendum 

Fellow Doctor Who star David Harewood, more widely known for playing CIA counterrorism center deputy director David Estes in Homeland, said: “This great relationship that we’ve had and the hours of laughter up in Scotland… it’s part of who we are, it’s part of our identity.”

Dan Snow, son of former BBC election night star Peter Snow, added: “I know I’ve got the wrong accent, I know I’m not from Scotland, but I’m just desperate to do something, anything, to stand up and say I think we’re better together. Let’s give this a chance. Don’t break-up what’s been a fantastically successful partnership.”

The campaign has been set up by up by Andrew McGuinness, founder of PR firm BMB, and Scots-born MT (Mary Teresa) Rainey, founder of creative agency RKCR. Organisers said a list of donors will be reported in due course to the Electoral Commission.

Mr McGuinness said: “As the Yes/No campaigns battle it out on Scottish turf, the views of people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have largely gone unheard.

“We also feel that the time has come for the whole of the UK to wake up to the break-up of Britain, and to show Scotland that we do care.”
