America's favourite cartoon family is going to feel a little more lifelike this summer as part of the Universal Studio's Theme Park in Orlando, Florida is turned into Springfield.

Visitors will be able to get 'Krusty-certified meat sandwiches' from a Krusty Burger, donuts from Lard Lad and beer at the Duff Brewery.

There will also be a Moe's Tavern along with a Cletus' Chicken Shack, a chance to snatch the catch of the day at The Frying Dutchman, eat a slice at Luigi's Pizza, and visit a Kwik-E-Mart.

Up close and personal: Guests will be able to meet The Simpsons in person and experience Springfield first hand

Springfield: An artist¿s rendering of Springfield, a new theme park-within-a-theme park based on The Simpsons¿ fictional hometown, which is set to open at Universal Orlando this summer

Main attraction: The Simpson's Ride allows guests to take a 3-D trip through Springfield. The ride opened in 2008 and the rest of Springfield has been constructed around it

Ride number two: A second ride,  alien characters Kang & Kodos¿ Twirl & Hurl will also be built to entertain visitors

America's favorite family: The Simpsons is now in its 25th season and 520th episode

The longest running scripted show in television history, The Simpsons quickly became a cultural phenomenon in 1990 and has remained one of the most groundbreaking and innovative entertainment franchises.

Matt Groening created the iconic family: Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The show is currently in its 25th season and about to air its 520th episode.

It's not the first time the theme park has recreated fictional food and places and brought them into the real world.

In 2010, Universal opened the hugely successful Wizarding World of Harry Potter which also saw recreations of food previously only found in the movies, made for public consumption.

The new Springfield attraction will 
anchored by the main attraction, 'The Simpsons Ride' which is already on 
site, and opened at the park in 2008. Guests are treated to a 3-D drive 
around Springfield.

Chaos: Daring visitors will be able to experience the chaos and madness of Springfield for themselves in The Simpsons ride!

Duff Beer: Homer Simpson's beer of choice. It is a parody of stereotypical commercial beer: cheap, poor-quality, and advertised everywhere. The theme park is having Duff specially brewed

Kwik-E-Mart: A parody of American convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Circle K, and depicts many of the stereotypes about them. It is notorious for its high prices and the poor quality of its merchandise

Anyone for a drink? Moe's Tavern is a the local bar in Springfield frequented by Homer Simpson, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard and Barney Gumble. The tavern is named after and run by Moe Szyslak.  The bar sells mostly Duff Beer

Krusty Burger: The fast food restaurant chain owned by Krusty the Clown as one of his many branded products and services. Krusty Burger is seen as a parody of a typical fast food chain such as McDonald's, Burger King, KFC or Arby's

It will be the only place in the world where guests can walk the streets of Springfield.

Fans will be able to walk down Fast Food Boulevard and visit the places that helped Springfield stake its claim as 'Shelbyville by the Sea.'

There will also be a second ride — alien characters Kang & Kodos’ Twirl & Hurl, which is essentially an outdoor spinner.

'This will be a must-see experience for Simpsons fans all over the world,' said Mark Woodbury, President of Universal Creative.

Seeing yellow: Visitors will be able to walk down a specially recreated Springfield Street

Donuttss! There will even be a donut store in Springfield at Universal Studios

Springfield stores: The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop is a comic book store owned by Jeff Albertson a.k.a. Comic Book Guy

'For the first time ever, they're going to be able to enter a world that they've only seen on television – and we're really excited to bring that world to life.'

'This new expansion will broaden and deepen the already incredible experience at Universal, by bringing to life the iconic landmarks of Springfield that fans have grown to love,' said Jeffrey Godsick, President, Fox Consumer Products.

'Fans will literally be able to live and breathe Springfield as they visit the statue of Jebediah, enjoy a Krusty Burger, and have a seat at Moe's Tavern, which are just a few of the great experiences awaiting at Universal.'

'It has been an honor to bring the world of the Simpsons to life in such a letter-perfect way,' said Denise Sirkot, President, Worldwide Brand, Gracie Films. 'Truly this is the Krustyest place on earth.'
