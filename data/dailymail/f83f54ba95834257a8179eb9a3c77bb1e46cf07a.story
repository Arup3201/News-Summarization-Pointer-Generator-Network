Two teenagers have been shot dead and five others injured including two children in a drive-by shooting at a home in New Orleans on Sunday, authorities said.

The attacker or attackers drove up in a dark-colored sedan before opening fire on a group of people gathered on a front porch in the Lower 9th Ward. The assailants then fled the scene, witnesses said.

Two boys, aged two and four, and a woman of unidentified age were hit several times and taken to hospital in a critical condition following the attack at 8pm.

A 13-year-old girl and 37-year-old woman were in stable condition after being injured by gunfire.

One of the young boys suffered a gunshot wound to the head, a relative told nola.com. 

The dead man is believed to be in his late teens and lived at the address where the shooting took place. 

The other fatality was named by relatives as Jasmine Anderson, 16, a student at ReNew Cultural Arts Academy who was due to return to classes today. 

Lillie Reese, the girl's great aunt, told nola.com: 'She had just gone to get a bottle of water and was walking past that house. Now my niece's life is gone behind someone else's foolishness.' 

Neighbors said there were a number of gunshots in two quick bursts - eight or nine shots and then at least six more following a short pause.

The Lower 9th, a predominantly black neighborhood less than five miles from the bustling tourist district of the French Quarter, was overwhelmed by Hurricane Katrina's floods in 2005.

In a separate, unrelated spate of violence, a 20-year-old man shot a friend on Sunday morning inside a hotel room at the edge of the Quarter, then killed himself after a three-hour standoff with police, authorities said. 

The shootings were the latest in a city dependent on tourists. In June, two men exchanged gunfire on Bourbon Street, killing one person and wounding nine others.
