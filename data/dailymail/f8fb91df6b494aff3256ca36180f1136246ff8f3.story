Sergio Aguero is ready to return to Manchester City's starting XI as they bid to beat Arsenal and close the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea.

And the Argentine hitman has revealed the new boots he will wear for what will be his first start since last December.

Aguero has scored 19 goals in 24 outings this season but missed the festive period due to a knee injury.

Sergio Aguero has revealed the new boots he will wear for his Manchester City return against Arsenal

Aguero will wear his new PUMA evoSPEED 1.3 studs for Man City's Premier League clash with the Gunners

After five weeks on the sidelines, he made a cameo during City's 1-1 draw with Everton at Goodison Park last weekend.

The 26-year-old is set to lead the line against Arsene Wenger's Gunners at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday afternoon and showed his excitement at the prospect of donning his new PUMA evoSPEED 1.3 studs.

Aguero posted a picture of the red boots on his Twitter page. The personalised 'Tricks' boots are inspired by his first club Independiente who wear red and white, where he became the youngest player to make his debut in a first division game in his native Argentina at the age of 15.

The boots also carry a picture of his beloved dog and feature his nickname 'Kun' embossed across the outside.

His closest family members and friends also appear above the formstripe, followed by 'Los Amo' which translates 'I love you' in Spanish.

Indeed, it will be a sentiment echoed by his manager Manuel Pellegrini if the striker can inspire champions City to another title in May.
