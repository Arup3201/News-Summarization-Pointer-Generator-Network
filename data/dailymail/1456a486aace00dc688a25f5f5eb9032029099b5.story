Meet the real life Puss In Boots.

Famous for his adorably cute face, the cartoon character won legions of fans when he first appeared on the big screen in the movie Shrek 2.

But while the animated version may be based on the fairy tale of the same name - Drogon the kitten, born with the same trademark giant eyes, is in no way made-up.

The black-footed cat was born in April at Philadelphia Zoo, Pennsylvania, and at eight weeks old weighs just 27 ounces.

He has doubled in weight in the last month and is being raised by his mother Aza, along with brother Viscerion and sister Rhaegal.

Unlike the wannabe Zorro from the films who joins Shrek and his band of friends, black-footed cats like Drogon prefer a solitary life.

They originate from south west Africa and are the smallest cats on the continent.

Keeper Ken Pelletier normally works with cats on a slightly larger scale, such as cheetahs and lynxes, but said he is thrilled to be working with Drogon nevertheless.

He said: 'It means a lot for me as a cat keeper.

'This is probably the most exciting thing for me in my 20 years at Philadelphia Zoo.'

MailOnline yesterday reported on another cute cat which features in an adorable video in which it trots along like a dressage horse.

The long-haired feline can be seen bouncing up and down on a wooden veranda, as it picks its paws up high.

To date, the 16-second YouTube video has been watched more than 400,000 times since it was uploaded on June 10.
