Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester, has demanded instant access to medical records of victims of domestic abuse

The police should have instant access to the medical records of women thought to be victims of domestic violence, even against their wishes, a senior officer said yesterday.

Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester, added that public services were required to safeguard the vulnerable, even if victims did not wish to complain.

He also called for access to confidential information about other vulnerable groups, including the elderly, those with dementia, suspected drug or alcohol abusers, and troubled families.

‘We could do a better job if we have greater access to information which it is currently hard for us to get,’ he said. ‘It would give us a deeper understanding of those we are expected to help.’

The demand raises questions about patient confidentiality and also means that those who speak openly to social workers or teachers – for example mothers in troubled families – could find themselves facing police investigations against their will.

In an interview with The Guardian, Sir Peter said state agencies and doctors should rethink the way they work and break confidentiality to prevent harm, for example in the case of women suspected to be victims of domestic violence.

He added that officers would avoid heavy-handed action in such circumstances. ‘The alternative is the woman continues to suffer,’ Sir Peter said.

‘There should be the ability to share the information, against the woman’s wishes, to solve the problem, without a criminal justice system approach.

‘Society has matured – there is a far greater expectation on public services to safeguard vulnerable people. Twenty years ago, with domestic abuse, it was seen as one of those things.

‘Now there’s a greater expectation agencies will safeguard the victim, whether or not they wish to make a complaint and enter the criminal justice system.’

Sir Peter said that with an ‘industry of case conferences and referral forms’, getting information was a drain on time and resources amid budget cuts.

Dr Tony Calland, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘The essential principle that runs throughout the recording of medical information is that of confidentiality and trust.

‘The checks and balances in the current legal position are satisfactory and whilst the current law may cause some difficulty for the police, the case has not been made to recommend a substantial change in the law.’
