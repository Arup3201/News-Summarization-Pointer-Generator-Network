The seventh Premier League loss of the season for David Moyes has brought the looming shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson to life as the iconic boss returned to Old Trafford. 

The 3-1 defeat by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge all but finished Manchester United's season and with the bookies predicting the departure of Moyes soon, Paddy Power have taken matters into their own hands by creating a waxwork of modern football's most successful manager.

Standing in his famous 'Fergie Time' pose, the 72-year-old has been placed in a glass box in front of the stadium he called home for 26-and-a-half years.

The box has been marked 'in case of emergency break glass' – and most United fans will feel this is such an emergency.

A Paddy Power spokesman said: 'Jose 
hammered the final nail into the coffin that is Man Utd’s season on 
Sunday night and their seventh loss of the season has brought Sir Alex 
back to Old Trafford.

'It’s
 officially an emergency now for the red devils and we expect our glass 
box could be broken even more quickly than a Wayne Rooney pledge of 
allegiance.'

The Premier League champions are currently in seventh position, six points adrift of Champions League qualification and no hopers in the title race, 14 points behind leaders Arsenal. 

Following the defeat in London, Moyes promised that United would refuse to surrender the title.

Passion? Sir Alex Ferguson raises his fist as he looks on from the stand at Stamford Bridge

He confessed he had hoped to be better placed at this stage of his debut Old Trafford season but rejected the notion of a crisis.

‘That’s your word, not mine,’ he said.

‘What we won’t do is throw in the towel until we can’t get there. The job is to try to finish first. I was hoping to win more and be competing a bit more than we’ve been but that will come.’

This is an emergency! Could Ferguson return to Old Trafford to replace under-fire Moyes?

Phil Jones struck the same note of defiance, claiming United are 'not a million miles away' from the Premier League's top three despite falling 14 points adrift.

'I don't think we're a long way away from the teams at the top,' Jones told manutd.com.

If Chelsea are one of the best two or three teams in the country, then I think you have to say we can be right up there alongside them - our performance in the first half proves that.

'We're not a million miles away, I'm telling you, but we need to stick together if we're going to turn it around.'

Jones admitted United's defeat at Stamford Bridge came down to being unable to take their chances and sloppy defending.

'We started really well,' Jones said.

'I thought in the first 30 minutes we were terrific. We set out and started in exactly the way we spoke about beforehand.

'We took the game to Chelsea, they couldn't get out of their own half and we totally dominated the match from the first whistle.

'We just couldn't find the goal that we probably needed to kick on from there.

'Then they had a bit of luck for the first goal and we conceded a couple of sloppy ones.

'Conceding just before half-time never helps.'

United will also bid to overturn a deficit in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Sunderland at Old Trafford.

Moyes' men trail 2-1 entering the second leg at Old Trafford and will 
be without Vidic, who will serve a three-match ban following his 
dismissal at Chelsea.

Jones added: 'Now we have to bounce back and we have an important game on Wednesday night.'
