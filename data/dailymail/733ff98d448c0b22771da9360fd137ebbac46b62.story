Laura Williamson’s criticism of Robbie Savage’s punditry split football opinion, with fans arguing over whether he is a breath of fresh air or a pain in the neck. Here are some of the best comments from MailOnline.

He might not be perfect, but he’s not the worst pundit. This just stinks of jealousy!!!

I cannot understand anything Savage says, I think he struggles to actually speak, especially when he is commentating! And the way he SHOUTS at the microphone is awful!! Possibly the worst pundit around, and I use that term loosely!

Totally agree. Savage is only interested in promoting himself. His points are nonsensical and the only reason I think he makes them is to get himself more airtime. When he is on 606, I switch the radio off.

lets be equal, London

I like him. He is informative and entertaining. If everyone was the same there would be no need for tins of assorted biscuits.

I bought BT broadband so that I could watch the matches. But this dumbing down blokey Fletch and Sav stuff is horrendous — a throw-back to the 1980s Saintsy and Greavsy.

I thought football presentation had grown up.

One of the harshest most uncalled for articles I have ever read. Sure the guy isn’t an amazing pundit but he’s by no means terrible and at least he’s honest and doesn’t pull any punches. Cheer up, there’s bigger things to worry about in the world.

Think about it for a moment; a bunch of executives sat around a table and decided that Savage would make a good pundit. Staggering. He’s just one of a number of pundits on radio and television who can’t actually speak English properly.

1 - ‘You need to take off your rose-scented glasses’ — Responding to a caller on his Saturday radio phone-in.

2 - ‘Football is easy’ — Insight during Aston Villa’s FA Cup win against Leicester on Sunday.

3 - ‘Outside the box, that’s a free-kick but inside the box, I don’t think it’s a penalty’ — Rewrites the rule book while discussing a contentious decision.

4 - ‘Palacios is stupid’ — The second most booked player in the Premier League slams the style of Wilson Palacios at the World Cup.

5 - ‘Mark crossed every i and dotted every t’ — Defends Mark Hughes after he quit Wales to join Blackburn in September, 2004.

Well don’t watch him & watch something else. Some of us quite like him actually.

I never liked him as a player and never liked him as pundit. I don’t normally dislike people but seriously, I don’t know why, but when it comes to R. Savage, I just had to change the channel.

DailyMe, London

I do not rate Savage as the brightest spark in the box but he is not the BBC’s only problem. We have all the same faces popping up as presenters of short documentaries, on quiz games, on reality shows for so called stars, talk shows, drama etc. I for one could do with seeing less of Stephen Fry and Jo Brand.

Sav’s great... and the rest of the BT Sport panel. It’s like mates chatting about footie. Not as straight laced as MOTD!!!! 

Kirstie381, Truro 

I like Robbie Savage, think he’s a top guy and quite funny. Fans will always criticise pundits because sometimes they say things we don’t agree with and so automatically they become a bad pundit, which is daft really because at the end of the day it’s only their opinion on how the game went or how a player performed!

So I’m not bothered who’s on motd or any other football show because I have my own opinions and I like to hear other people’s opinions.

I didn’t like him as a player — total wind-up merchant, but I actually quite like him as a pundit. He’s not afraid to say what he really thinks, which at least makes it a bit more interesting than the usual monotonous drivel. 

Keowned97, London

At least this man has played the game at a high level. Show us YOUR international caps... No, thought not.

Peter B, Bedford

The way he criticises others, you would think he was a Ronaldo as a player.
