A prankster tweeted an authentic-looking letter to himself claiming to be from the Royal Mail that warned him to stop 'repeatedly answering the door naked'.

The letter, addressed to Stuart Whitman, 42, from Gloucester, asked if he could stop 'jumping out of bushes' and shouting 'Beware of the giant bees' at postal workers.

Purporting to be from the Royal Mail's headquarters in London, it said: 'I'm writing to you on behalf of the Gloucester branch who have raised a number of concerns with your recent behaviour towards our staff.

Hoax: The letter purporting to be from Royal Mail, addressed to a Mr Whitman from Gloucester

'Whilst we appreciate that your actions are in no way malicious and are meant in good humour, a number of complaints have been made.

'Recent events cited include jumping out of a bush shouting "Beware of the giant bees!", repeatedly answering the door naked and asking if it's "First Class".'

The letter continues: 'As such we would like to ask you to kindly desist from your 'surprises' or we would be forced to review whether we could maintain services to your property.'

Mr Whitman revealed he was inspired by William Donaldson, who used the pen name Henry Root to write hoax letters to the likes of Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s.

The IT specialist said: 'I had been thinking about doing it for a while and I eventually decided to write it on a Friday night when I was bored.

The missive to Greater Anglia that enclosed a rejection letter, which the complainant has 'taken the liberty of rolling up very tightly'

'I took the time to give it the proper letterhead and printed it off before photographing it and posting it on Twitter.

'Normally nothing happens but I just sat there and my phone kept pinging from all the retweets. It just went mad.'

A Royal Mail spokesman told MailOnline: 'This has indeed been revealed as a hoax, albeit a very amusing one.'

The letter follows a missive to Greater Anglia train company in March in which an irate passenger who was refused a refund for a cancelled train came up with a novel use for his rejection letter.

The anonymous passenger bemoaned the fact the refund was not possible because he did not apply within the requisite 28 days.

Enclosing the rejection letter, which the complainant has 'taken the liberty of rolling up very tightly', he advises the customer services contact where to stick it.
