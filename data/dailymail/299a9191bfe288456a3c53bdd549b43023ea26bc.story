Brendan Rodgers has revealed Raheem Sterling has been offered a 'wonderful deal' and warned the player's advisors that Liverpool will not be held to ransom over his future.

The England international has yet to agree new terms after talks stalled  for a number of months.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said at the weekend it was imperative that the futures of Sterling and Jordan Henderson, Liverpool's vice captain, were sorted out quickly to end any lingering uncertainty about their futures.

Sterling has just over  two years left on his current deal while Henderson is in the final 18 months of his terms, but Rodgers is confident that both issues will get finalised sooner rather than later.

Liverpool's manager has, though, made it clear that the terms offered to Sterling are both generous and reflect his position at the club.

'Steven is relaying what the club is wanting. Both players are very important for the future. I'm sure it will be resolved fairly soon,' he said.

'Raheem is going to get rewarded. He has been offered a wonderful deal, an incredible deal for a young player. He is very happy here and you can see that in his play. 

'We are certainly not going to be a club that gives out way, way above what they are worth. We reward our best players.

'It is very important for young players to have something to strive for and if they get too much too soon it will sabotage their development. Raheem has been outstanding since he was put in the team but you have to remember this was a 17-year-old who was put into the team.

'We believe this is the best place for him. But you have to leave something there for the next one for them to progress.'
