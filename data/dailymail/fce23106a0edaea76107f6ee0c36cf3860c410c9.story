Forget making time for your family, the average British household manages to spend as little as three hours and six minutes of quality time together in a week, according to a new study. 

Long working hours, lengthy commutes and after school clubs mean parents can only spare an average 62 minutes to chat or play with their kids, on three typical week nights.

And after chores and domestic duties, only five hours and nine minutes of play time are squeezed out of the average weekend.

It has been revealed that the average British family only spends three hours and six minutes together a week

In fact, seven in ten of the 2,000 parents polled confessed the only real guaranteed quality time they spend with their family is on their one annual holiday.

The poll also found that keeping fit was keeping the family apart with 35 per cent saying their family members take regular exercise, but mainly through solo activities such as gym workouts or P.E. lessons at school. 

For many of those polled quality time just simply isn't an option with a fifth of parents agreeing they never have a chance to do things as an entire family, as the kids' after-school clubs and parents' working late prevents them from returning home at the same time. 

A further 26 per cent said it's too hard to get the kids out of their bedrooms, while almost four in ten parents said they're usually glued to their phones or tablets.

Even when it comes to the weekend Britain is struggling for time. With school and work commitments dominating the week, over half said that laundry, grocery shopping and 'life admin' are top priorities on Saturdays and Sundays.

Weekends are also spent ferrying kids to football practice, the research showed, as well as their friends' houses and birthday parties.

Work infiltrates home life with one in ten parents admitting to answering office emails in their downtime

And working life often spills over into the weekend for one in ten, who said they spend a lot of their 'down time' answering work emails.

When they do get together as a family, eight in ten adults said their time is still spent separately - with family members often distracted by their phones or laptops.

The majority of those surveyed (six in ten) agreed that when they spend time with a family member they would rather watch a film together than try a bonding family activity like swimming or a bike ride.

A helpless 35 per cent of parents think their kids find family time 'boring', and admitted they struggle to find something to do that everyone can enjoy.

Amazingly, the same amount said that their kids are so absent that most of their interaction is through texting or Facebook messaging rather than face to face.

With so many obstacles, half of parents admitted they often feel like giving up on spending significant time with the children.

School extra-curricular activities are another element that separates families during the week

Although over half agreed that exercising together is a great family activity, one in ten of the adults said they can only find the time for it once every month.

A spokesman for David Lloyd Leisure, which commissioned the study, said: 'It seems everyone is leading very busy lives, but very little quality time is being spent together as a family.

'It's difficult to be upbeat after a hard day at work, and often we end up retiring to our rooms early.

'Being distracted by the internet, television and other modes of technology is also to blame.'

The spokesman added that it is important for families to ditch their technical devices every now and then and spend some quality time together outdoors.  

'Rather than parents and kids doing everything separately, families would benefit from finding things they can do together - like exercise.' 

'These days everything we do is so tech-based, with handheld devices often stealing the show.

'Putting our phones and tablets down and getting out of the house to do something active together is great for bonding, and could inject some energy back into our family lives.'
