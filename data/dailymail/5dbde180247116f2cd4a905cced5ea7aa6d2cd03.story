Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum engaged in a hostile exchange over gay marriage on Thursday, when asked to explain why he, personally, would be affected if same-sex marriages were legalised.

The meeting ended with Santorum getting booed by much of the crowd in Concord, which included many college and high-school students, after suggesting that children raised by same-sex parents are being 'harmed'.

'How does it affect you personally if two men or two women get married?' Santorum was asked at the College Convention 2012, to broad applause and cheers.

Controversy: Santorum drew jeers from the crowd during a campaign stop on Thursday in Concord, New Hampshire for his position on gay marriage

Santorum said that basic rights taken for granted by married people, such as the ability to visit their loved one in the hospital and make medical decisions on their behalf – can also be arranged for same-sex couples. 'That can be done legally, through contract.'

The former U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania, who is coming off a surprise near-victory in this week’s Iowa caucuses, then pivoted, and went on to equate same-sex marriages to multiple marriages.

'What about three men?' he said, as jeers rang out. 'If you think it’s okay for two, you have to differentiate for me why you’re not okay with three. Any two people, or any three, or four.”'

'He was comparing same-sex marriage to polygamy. I find that very insulting. We asked about two consenting adults,' said Tyrone Davis, 18, who was attending the College Convention 2012 in Concord from his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 'I don’t support Santorum at all. It seems he’s trying to create a theocracy.'

Santorum went on to say that 
marriages that produce children should have 'privileged status,' which 
might be news even to straight, childless couples.

'Marriage
 is the union of a man and a woman. God made men and women. Men and 
women come together in a union to have children. It should be valued and
 have privileged status over people who want to have a relationship 
together.

'The uniqueness of marriage is it provides an intrinsic good to society. It’s the union that causes children to be born and raised in an environment that’s a birthright. When we deny children that birthright by saying other types of relationships are okay – I think we are harming children.'

'The uniqueness of marriage is it provides an intrinsic good to
 society. It’s the union that causes children to be born and raised in 
an environment that’s a birthright.

'When we deny children that 
birthright by saying other types of relationships are okay – I think we 
are harming children,' Santorum said.

The
 College Convention is a once-every-four-year event that gathers college
 and high school students from across the nation to discuss the 
political climate.

Rhiannon Pyle, 17, of Newburyport, Massachusetts, asked Santorum the question about how his same-sex marriage opposition squared with support of constitutional rights for all. 'We don’t see same sex marriage as a big deal,' the high school student said. “I’m sure it’s not going to be the first issue for a lot of people.'

Gay marriage has been legal in New Hampshire since 2010. Santorum was asked if, should he become president, he would uphold state laws on issues such as that and the legality of medical marijuana. “I don’t believe that we can have 50 definitions of marriage in this country,” he said.

He went on to draw a parallel between
 states being allowed to set policy on things like medical marijuana use
 and states being allowed to sterilize their citizens. 'States have 
rights. But they don’t have the rights to do anything they want to.'

The
 heated exchange followed another line of fire as the politician  
defended his infamous 2003 comments on homosexuality and 'man on dog' 
sex on Wednesday night in an interview with CNN's John King.

'If you think it’s okay for two, you have to differentiate for me why you’re not okay with three. Any two people, or any three, or four."'

- Rick Santorum

Asked by an Associated Press reporter
 on whether he thought that if someone is homosexual, he would argue 
that individual should not have sex, Santorum responded in part: 

'Every society in the history of man has
 upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman.
 Why? Because society is based on one thing: that society is based on 
the future of the society. And that's what? Children. Monogamous 
relationships.

'In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality.'

But in response to King asking how he 'connected the dots' and made the link, Santorum insisted his words had been misconstrued.

Tongue tied: Santorum caught more heat after campaigning at The Daily Grind in Sioux City, Iowa on Sunday, where he reportedly singled out 'black people' in referring to federal benefits

Getting it straight: Santorum denied making the remark appearing on FOX News' 'The O'Reilly Factor', insisting he said 'blah' people, not 'black' people

He answered: 'Hold on a second, John.
 Read the quote. I said it's not. It is not. I didn't say it is. I said 
it's not. You know, I don't - I'm trying to understand what you're 
trying to make the point. I said it's not those things. I didn't connect
 them. I specifically excluded them.'

Santorum
 also denied today making comments on Sunday about 'black people's 
lives', after sharp criticism from the NAACP for singling out 
African-Americans about federal benefits.

'He was comparing same-sex marriage to polygamy. I find that very insulting. We asked about two consenting adults.'

- Tyrone Davis, 18, Baton Rouge, Louisiana

The former senator reportedly told 
reporters at an Iowa campaign stop: 'I don't want to make black people's
 lives better by giving them somebody else's money. I want to give them 
the opportunity to go out and earn the money.'Appearing on FOX News' 'The O'Reilly Factor', he said the remark occurred when he stumbled over his words.

'I looked at that, and I didn't say that. If you look at it, what I started to say is a word and then sort of changed and it sort of - blah - came out. And people said I said "black." I didn't.'

The swarm of scrutiny is rising as 
Santorum, who until Iowa had been treated as little more than a footnote
 through the primaries, achieved a near-victory in the leadoff caucuses 
by a narrow eight votes, nearly edging out chief rival Mitt Romney.

But he is not the only GOP contender who has caught heat amid reports of racially-charged comments in recent days.

Republican presidential candidate 
Newt Gingrich said Thursday he is willing to go before the NAACP and 
urge blacks to demand paychecks, not food stamps.

Gingrich told a town hall meeting at a senior centre in Plymouth, New Hampshire, that if the NAACP invites him to its annual convention this year, he'd go there and talk about 'why the African-American community should demand paychecks and not be satisfied with food stamps.'

He also said he'd pitch a new Social Security program aimed at helping young people, particularly African-American males, who he said get the smallest return on Social Security.
