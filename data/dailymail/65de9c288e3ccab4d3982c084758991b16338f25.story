From Marni's embrace of graphic artist Brian Rea to Prada's emphasis on pop art prints, fashion that nods to the art world is bang on trend.

But although it might appear to be a modern phenomenon, fashion's love affair with art began more than a century ago, with Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali among the names to have turned their hand to textile design,

Now creations by Dali, Warhol and Picasso are to join pieces by Marc Chagall, Henry Matisse and Yorkshire sculptor Henry Moore in a stunning new exhibition opening tomorrow.

Artist Textiles: Picasso to Warhol documents fashion's early fascination with art and includes designs by Warhol that, until recently, languished in the attic of a family of New York decorators.

The creations, which include a delicate pattern of repeating blue butterflies, were unearthed by curator Richard Chamberlain, and were commissioned by fabric companies eager to sell their customers a wearable piece of modern art.

'The Warhol pieces are extremely rare due to them having been lost for so many years and only recently having been discovered,' explains Chamberlain.

'Warhol was already engaged with graphic design, so textile design was another string to his bow,' he adds.

'Whether it was a record cover for the RCA or a textile for Fuller fabrics, Warhol was always willing to satisfy any paying customer.'

And he wasn't the only one. Spanish surrealist Salvador Dali and Hungarian costume designer Marcel Vertès both created work for New York based Wesley Simpson Custom Fabrics, while in 1947, Henri Matisse designed a limited edition pattern for Ascher Scarves.

Other artists to cash in on their talents included Pablo Picasso, who, in a coup for Fuller Fabric boss, Dan Fuller, agreed to contribute to the company's 'Modern Master Prints' series.

Although initially reluctant, by the 1960s, shoppers were able to purchase Picasso-designed textiles that could be used for almost anything, with the single exception of upholstery.

As Chamberlain puts it: 'Picassos may be leaned against, but not sat on.'

By contrast, Warhol was happy for his work to be put to any use the new owners required and went on to become one of the most referenced artists of the 20th century.

'Warhol continually influences designers,' adds Chamberlain. 'The bright colours and blotted ink lines are very fashionable both in textile design, illustration and graphics.'

And Chamberlain isn't wrong. More than 60 years after he first appeared on the scene, all it takes is a swift look at Prada's latest collection to see that Warhol's talent for textiles remains as influential as ever. 

Artist Textiles: Picasso to Warhol opens tomorrow at the Fashion and Textile Museum. Tickets cost £8 for adults, concessions £6.50. See ftmlondon.org for more information.
