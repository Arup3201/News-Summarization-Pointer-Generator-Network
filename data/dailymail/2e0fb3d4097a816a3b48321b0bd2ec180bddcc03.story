It is unlikely that Tiger Woods and Rory Mcllroy have heard of 12-year-old Chinese schoolboy Ye Wocheng.

But there is every chance that over the next few years, they will be hearing quite a lot about the young golf sensation.

Ye will become the youngest player ever to compete in a European Tour event after qualifying for the Volvo China Open.

Sensation: Chinese schoolboy Ye Wocheng will become the youngest player ever to compete in a European Tour event after qualifying for the Volvo China Open

The youngster finished third yesterday in one of the four 36-hole regional qualifiers for the event.

Ye, a member of the Hillview Golf Club
in Dongguan, is set to break the record held by Guan Tianlang, who was 
13 when he played in the China Open last year.

Ye said he'd been thinking for a year 
about breaking the European Tour set by Guan, another Chinese player who
later won the Asian amateur title in November at age 14 to become the 
youngest qualifier ever for the Masters.

Ye said he was nervous yesterday
morning, but he didn't show it as he birdied the first two holes to move
into the lead at 7 under.

Record-breaker: Ye will set the record when he appears at Binhai Lake Golf Club in May

'I couldn't have got off to a much 
better start,' he said. 'I actually slept very well last night, so I was
really looking forward to the round. My dad told me to just relax and 
enjoy it, but it was actually quite a nerve-wracking day.'

Ye dropped shots at the 11th and 14th holes, but made a birdie at the par-3 15th.

According to the China Open 
organisers, a sliced drive on the par-5 16th resulted in a recovery shot
from the trees, but Ye was penalized two shots and had to take an 8 on 
the hole instead of a bogey.

'I didn't realise I'd broken the rules
on 16, I thought I'd made bogey there,' he said. 'Fortunately I had 
enough strokes in hand to qualify in spite of that, so in the end it 
didn't really matter.'

Ye dropped another shot on his last 
hole but it was still enough to get one of the three qualifying spots 
from the Western China qualifier.

Stars: Ye Wocheng will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of the world's best golfers, like Rory Mcllroy, left, and Tiger Woods, right

'Playing in a European Tour event will
be a whole new experience for me so I'll be practicing very hard,' he 
said. 'I will also be doing some gym work to get stronger.'

Ye's coach David Williams said it was only a matter of time before his young student had an important breakthrough.

'He's been shooting in the 60s 
regularly over the past few months so I am not surprised at all to see 
him qualify for the European Tour,' Mr Williams said. 'We made it our goal 
to train hard and to focus on breaking Guan Tianlang's record, and now 
that goal has been achieved.'

European Tour tournament director Mikael Eriksson congratulated Ye 'for a remarkable performance'.

He carded a 68 despite three-putting his last two holes on Tuesday at the Wolong Valley Country Club.

He had a 2-over 74 on yesterday to finish three shots behind Jin Daxing and Li Xinyang with a two-round total of 142

Ye's appearance at Binhai Lake Golf 
Club in May will beat the previous record of his compatriot Guan 
Tianlang, who competed last year as a 13-year-old.
