A Falklands veteran who saved the life of a comrade during battle has died after collapsing halfway through a Remembrance Day service.

Former Scots Guard Archie Beaty, 56, fell ill minutes after laying the wreath at his local Remembrance Day service, in Marlow, his tearful daughter said yesterday.

Mr Beaty had been given the honour for his service with 2nd Battalion Scots Guards in the Falklands, during which he pulled wounded colleague Steve Duffy to safety during a heavy Argentinian 
bombardment.

But after his once-in-a lifetime experience the father-of-three collapsed and was rushed to hospital where he later died.

Mr Beaty, from Windsor, Berkshire, is thought to have suffered a heart attack during the event in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.

Paramedics treated him at the scene before rushing him to Wexham Park Hospital in Slough but he could not be saved.

His distraught daughter Claire, 30, said: 'The only way I can sum it up is I have been broken into a million pieces.

'Itâ€™s not fair, but he died doing what he loved, on one of the most important dates of his life.

'He was the one to lay the wreath and he was dead an hour or two later. My life is never going to be the same again.'

Daughter Lynn Beaty, 33, left a tribute to her dad online.

She wrote: 'We are absolutely heartbroken to have lost dad, but we are so comforted by all your kind words and great memories of our dad.'

After leaving the forces he and his wife Diane fostered 53 children over the course of 22 years.

Mr Duffy, a Pipe Major from the Scots Guards Association. Pipes & Drums, who remained a lifelong friend, said: 'I owe him a great debt of gratitude that I can never repay.

'He had, through an act of selfless bravery, saved my life all those years ago, rescuing me whilst under heavy mortar and artillery fire when I was severely wounded.

'This was one of many acts of bravery for which he was never properly recognised.'

He added: 'His is one of the many untold stories of valour and courage in the face of adversity. It was strangely appropriate that I was there with him on Sunday.

'He was courageous and unselfish to the end being more concerned with not letting his colleagues in the band or the parade down rather than look after himself.'

Mr Beaty lived with his wife Diane, 52, and three children, Claire, Lynn and Max.

Mr Duffy said: 'He had huge enthusiasm for everything he did and his infectious and mischievous humour endeared him to everyone that he met.

'He was a terrific ambassador for the band and his former regiment.'

Archie was a drummer in the Scots Guards Assoc. Pipes & Drums band, who played a key role in the Armistice Day tribute.
