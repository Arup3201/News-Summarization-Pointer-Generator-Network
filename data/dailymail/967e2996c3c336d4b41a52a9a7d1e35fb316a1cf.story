Finger lickin': The Southern chef, 67, was a popular host on the Food Network for 13 years and has purchased 440 episodes along with previously unseen footage

Embattled TV chef Paula Deen has bought the rights to the TV shows and video that she starred in during her career on the Food Network.

The Southern chef, 67, was a popular host on the Food Network for over 13 years and has purchased 440 episodes along with previously unseen footage ahead of the launch of her online TV network.

Her company, ‘Paula Deen Ventures’ said it plans to show the footage on her new network which launches on Wednesday. 

The network will be subscriber-based and will use www.PaulaDean.com as a portal, to air video of Deen and guests cooking in front of a studio audience.

Deen’s company is expected to charge between $7.99 and $9.99 a month for access to the broadcasts.

It is backed by a $100 million private-equity investment from Phoenix-based Najafi Cos.

A spokesperson for the Food Network told The Wall Street Journal: ‘I can share that Paula asked if we'd be willing to sell the library; we reached an agreement, and everyone here wishes her the best as she embarks on her new venture.’ 

The celebrity chef, who counted billionaire Oprah Winfrey as one of her close friends has had a tumultuous few years mired by a race hate scandal.

N-word: The celebrity chef counted billionaire Oprah Winfrey as one of her close friends but has had a tumultuous few years mired by a race hate scandal

In 2012, a former manager at Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia, sued her and her brother for sexual and racial harassment.

Lisa T. Jackson's lawsuit alleged that Deen and Bubba committed violence, discrimination and racism which ended her five-year employment at Deen's Lady & Sons and Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House eateries in Savannah. 

In a deposition in court, Deen acknowledged using the ‘N word,’ but not telling racial jokes. 

In June last year, she issued a grovelling, tearful video apology for her use of the word.

‘I want to apologize to everybody for the wrong that I've done,’ Deen said in the video statement.

‘I want to learn and grow from this. Inappropriate and hurtful language is totally, totally unacceptable. I've made plenty of mistakes along the way but I beg you, my children, my team, my fans, my partners, I beg for your forgiveness.’

Since then, her vast food empire has taken a hit and many of her fans have deserted her.

She was dropped by The Food Network and a host of other sponsors.

But the chef, known for her love of cooking fried food, still has a loyal fan base and is hoping to capitalize on this by going digital.

In the wake of the scandal fans sent origami-folded butter wrappers to the Food Network and other companies that dropped the popular chef and cookbook author as a sign of protest.

Her network said it has plans  to broadcast a self-produced documentary next year about the ups-and-downs that she has faced over the past few years.

In 2012, just before the race scandal exploded, Deen announced that she had developed Type-2 Diabetes.

However, she was widely criticized for promoting her brand of high-fat, sugary Southern cuisine while also endorsing a diabetes drug. 

She is now hoping that her new network will give her a degree of creative and financial control.

‘That's the beauty of what we're doing now. We have total and complete control,’ she said.

‘If we disagree on something, we can discuss it right then and there. We don't have to put it before a group in a tall building somewhere. We can discuss it right there. It's as real as it can get’ she told The Wall Street Journal.

Deen's network also plans to air several new programs, featuring herself and her two sons Jamie and Bobby, who are also chefs.

Yet despite her latest move aimed at rejuvenating her career Deen admits that her past scandals may always haunt her.

In February she told People magazine: ‘I feel like 'embattled' or 'disgraced' will always follow my name.’

‘It's like that black football player who recently came out,’ she said, referring to Michael Sam.

‘He (Sam) said, 'I just want to be known as a football player. I don't want to be known as a gay football player.' I know exactly what he's saying.’
