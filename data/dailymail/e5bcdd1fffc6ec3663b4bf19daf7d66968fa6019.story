A 16-year-old boy who was fatally bashed by three teenagers in Perth's north last year had been lured to a bush reserve under the guise of a cannabis deal, but they planned to rob him, a court has heard.

Quinn De Campe was found bleeding, bruised and unconscious in Balga bushland on December 22.

Within hours of being rushed to hospital in a critical condition, he was declared brain dead.

The following day, he died from a traumatic brain injury, caused by multiple blows.

Three teenage boys were initially charged with grievous bodily harm but that was later upgraded to murder.

Quinn de Campe was fatally bashed by three teenagers on December 22, when they lured him into Western Australian bushland to rob him 

In the West Australian Children's Court on Monday, they pleaded guilty to unlawful killing - a plea bargain accepted by the prosecution. The teens, along with another boy, also admitted to stealing from the victim.

The court was told the boys stole $175 and two debit card from Quinn.

The court also heard that Quinn had told his loved ones he was going to buy half an ounce of cannabis for his friends as Christmas gifts, having arranged to meet one of his attackers via Facebook.

He barely knew the teen, having only spent one term with him at the same high school.

Prosecutor Linda Petrusa said the young offenders made plans to 'roll' Quinn, with three of them laying in wait while the other boy met him and directed him into the bushland, saying that was a route to the dealer's house.

Quinn refused to give up his belongings and was bashed to death. He was also kicked so hard as he lay on the ground that it left a shoe sole impression on his face

As the teens had conspired, they pretended to hold up their accomplice with a broken bottle.

He fled, and when the three boys turned on Quinn, he refused to give up his belongings.

Quinn was punched in the mouth but remained defiant, spitting blood into one of his attackers' face.

That enraged the teen, who punched Quinn repeatedly.

He was also kicked so hard as he lay on the ground that it left a shoe sole impression on his face.

One of the teens later told police that he became enraged when Quinn 'arced up'.

'We thought it was going to be easier than that,' he told detectives.

'There was no backing down - I was with my mates.'

Sentencing has been scheduled for November 19 and 20.
