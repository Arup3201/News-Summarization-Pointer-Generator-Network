Manchester United's absence from the Champions League next season will cost the club £30m, revealed the club's executive vice chairman Ed Woodward.

However, Woodward insisted it would not affect United's transfer business.

'Due to the television deals, we estimate our loss of European football will cost us in the mid £30m. The club's expectations are to absolutely get back into the Champions League and you'll see it in the transfer market.'

Meanwhile, United have reported record revenues for the third quarter of the financial year which club chiefs say puts them in a good position to invest in the squad and challenge for the title next season.

The Red Devils have reported revenues of £115.5m for the quarter, up 26 per cent, mainly due to rises in income from Premier League broadcasting money and sponsorship deals.

The financial picture for United’s current season looks rosy - sponsorship income rose 43.5 per cent while United’s overall debt is down 4.3 per cent at £351.7m, while the cost of servicing that debt also fell - there was a £2.8m reduction in interest payable following refinancing in June last year.

Broadcasting revenue for the third quarter was £35.6million, an increase of £13.9million or 64.1%, due to increased revenue from the Premier League.

It will be this time next year however that the impact of not playing in the Champions League will be felt, though there will also be extra income from United’s huge Chevrolet sponsorship deal which comes on stream next season.
