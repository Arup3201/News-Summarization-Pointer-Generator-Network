Mother: Susan Christine Warner, 40, has been charged with three counts of neglect after leaving her 3 and 10-year-old daughters alone with her bedridden great-grandmother

Two sisters and their bedridden great-grandmother were removed from what police described as a filth-ridden home after abandoned by their mother for a weekend getaway to an Orlando theme park.

Authorities were alerted to the Port Charlotte home's deplorable and unsafe conditions on Sunday when the 10-year-old knocked on a neighbour's door saying she was hungry.

Entering the home police described it filled with flies, rotting and mouldy food, piled trash bags and dog faeces scattering the floor with signs of having been walked through.

The youngest three-year-old girl was described by officers as filthy, wearing oversized clothing and running around barefoot in the home's waste.

In the master bedroom 'littered with piles of dirty clothes and old food containers,' they reported finding the 87-year-old great-grandmother, bedridden and smelling of urine.

'Deputies learned she had fallen four days before, urinated in her bed and was very confused,' police said in a release.

The woman was taken to Fawcett Memorial Hospital where detectives were told she 'had dried feces and dirt on the bottom of her feet.

'The top of her feet showed brown substance squished up between her toes consistent with stepping in a pile of dog feces.'

Deplorable: Police found the home's condition unlivable with no clear path to the one working toilet, pictured, and the one shower filled with clothes and broken toys

Wall-to-wall waste: Police described the home as smelling of rotting food, faeces, diapers and piled trash bags

The home was deemed uninhabitable under its current conditions, with one working bathroom whose walkway was caked with clothes and soiled baby diapers.

The one shower in the house was described as stopped up and filled with clothes, broken toys and other items.

Returning home to the investigation with her eldest 14-year-old daughter around 8.30pm, mother Susan Christine Warner was described as 'screaming and crying' at the scene.

Warner acknowledged the filth and apologized but said she had been suffering depression ever since her husband was incarcerated in June and had to get away.

Neglect: The home's bathroom is seen lined with waste and clothing while just feet from where the great-grandmother laid in bed smelling of urine and her feet covered in faeces

Cry for help: A can of tomato soup is seen with multiple holes after the hungry 10-year-old unsuccessfully tried to open it while right another area of the home is seen piled with trash and other items

She said she had driven to Universal Studio's Halloween Horror Nights on Friday with her 14-year-old - an approximately three-hour drive - but arriving too late to attend the event, they spent the night.

She promised to clean the house up and said she thought her two youngest children would be all right with an adult, the 87-year-old woman, being around.

Warner's three children were turned over to the care of a family member after sharing pizza purchased by the concerned neighbor.

Charged with two counts of child neglect and one for neglect of an elderly person, Warner was taken to the Charlotte County Jail and held without bond.
