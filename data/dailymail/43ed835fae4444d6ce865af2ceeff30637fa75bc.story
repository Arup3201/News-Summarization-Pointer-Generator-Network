Pharmaceuticals giant AstraZenca is to axe 700 jobs in the UK as part of restructuring plans that include the likely closure of its Cheshire based research and development facility, Alderley Park, it announced today.

The part-British part-Swedish firm said around 1,600 jobs would be cut worldwide over the next three years as it overhauls R&D operations in three major centres in Britain, the U.S and Sweden.

The move will see the end of drug research at the Alderley Park facility, for many years a hub of the group's R&D efforts.

Job cuts: drugs firm Astrazeneca has announced that up to 1,000 jobs could go in the UK and that its Alderly Park facility will most likely close. Many jobs will be relocated to the nearby Macclesfield centre (pictured).

AstraZenca said it was committed to 
‘exploring all options to ensure that Alderley Park has a successful 
future.’ 

Alderley Park currently employs 2,900 people. The drug firm 
said 1,600 roles would be relocated to either Cambridge or Macclesfield, 
with the majority relocating to Cambridge, but 700 people faced being 
made redundant. It added a further 300 further roles could be relocated
outside the UK

The decision 
to stop drug research at Alderley Park, the company's largest R&D 
site, is a major blow to a region that has relied on a centre where 
AstraZeneca and its predecessor ICI have been discovering medicines for 
more than 40 years.

It is also
another setback for the Government’s ambitions to make Britain a world 
leader in pharmaceutical research, following an earlier decision by Pfizer to shut its R&D site in Sandwich, Kent two years ago and 
previous cuts by AstraZeneca's former management.

Alderley Park lies within the parliamentary constituency of Chancellor George Osborne.

Unions accused AstraZeneca of creating a ‘skills crisis’ in the North West by draining the region of highly skilled research and development jobs in the middle of an economic downturn.

The GMB said it was "devastating" news for the workers, adding that the announcement meant there would be a net job loss of 1,000 in the UK by 2016.

GMB national officer Allan Black 
said: ‘This is disastrous news for the UK, and for the North West in 
particular. The vast majority of the jobs to go are research and 
development jobs at the Alderley Park site in Cheshire. There has been 
salami-slicing of jobs at this site but this is by far and away the 
largest slice of job losses at the site to date.

‘These are cutting-edge R&D jobs 
that are both well-paid and essential for a thriving UK economy. 
Highly-skilled and qualified workers will be put on the scrapheap.’

Unite national officer Linda McCulloch said: ‘AstraZeneca's decision to relocate over 1,000 jobs to Cambridge is a massive blow for the North West. The company is creating a skills crisis for the local economy.

‘After 40 years of success and hundreds of millions of pounds of investment, we are at a loss as to why AstraZeneca is now pulling out of Alderley Park. The region desperately needs this highly-skilled workforce - they make a huge contribution to the economy and to the community.

‘Staff will be shell-shocked by this announcement. Skilled scientific jobs are in short supply and there are many families based around Alderley Park with deep roots in the community. It is going to be a real struggle to relocate families hundreds of miles away to Cambridge.’

The company said the investment reinforced its long-term commitment to the UK and underscored this country's global importance as a location for biopharmaceutical research and development.

AstraZenca’s
chief executive Pascal Soriot, who will present his detailed strategy 
plans for the group to investors on March 21, said the programme would 
lead to $1.4billion (£926.6 million) in one-time restructuring charges.
Annualised benefits of the overhaul are expected to reach approximately
$190million by 2016.

The 
plan includes a £330million investment in a new, purpose-built facility
in Cambridge, where AstraZeneca aims to tap into an environment of 
world-class academic and clinical life sciences research.

'This
is a major investment in the future of this company that will enable us
to accelerate innovation by improving collaboration, reducing 
complexity and speeding up decision-making,' Mr Soriot said.

Science minister David Willetts said: ‘AstraZeneca's decision to invest £330million in a world leading R&D facility in Cambridge is a real vote of confidence in the UK life sciences sector.

‘They chose to make this major investment in the UK after considering options around the world. Our strategy for life sciences provides a very competitive environment in the UK to conduct highly skilled research keeping us ahead in the global race.

‘Clearly the decision to reduce R&D activity at Alderley Park is disappointing. But the government will work closely with AstraZeneca and local partners to ensure this excellent facility has a prosperous future with new opportunities for the site.

‘I have agreed with AstraZeneca and local leaders that a taskforce will be established to co-ordinate work to support Alderley Park staff and the local economy during the transition. This will work to ensure a sustainable, thriving future for the site.’

Mr Soriot, a former Roche executive who took over last October, has his work cut 
out to turn around AstraZeneca, which faces loss of patent protection on
key drugs, which analysts expect will lead to an expected fall in sales
of nearly $6billion over the next five years.

As
a pure pharmaceuticals group, without the cushion of alternative 
revenue streams, AstraZeneca is particularly exposed to patent losses on
key prescription drugs, limiting its room for manoeuvre.

But
Mr Soriot hopes to reinvigorate the company by expanding on existing 
growth business, including the new heart drug Brilinta, and using 
acquisitions to buy in promising new medicines.
