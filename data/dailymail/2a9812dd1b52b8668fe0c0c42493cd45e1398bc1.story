The authoritarian style of parenting championed by Chinese-American author Amy Chua in her 2011 book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, may do more harm than good, according to a new study.

Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, studied more than 250 Chinese-American immigrant families in the San Francisco area, conducting interviews, parent-child interaction activities and academic assessments of the children over two years.

The team, led by assistant professor of psychology, Qing Zhou, found that Tiger Parents rear children with 'more 
aggression, depression, anxiety and social problems.'

Their research, which looked at how often parents verbally criticized their children or made them do things without explanation, also found that these children had 'poorer social skills' than their peers.

Now, according to CBS News, the team conducts workshops to help divorced Chinese-American mothers learn to use 'positive parenting strategies', like one-on-one 'fun time' with their children.

Ms Zhou says many mothers are initially unfamiliar with this 'Western' way of parenting, but that they soon find that it leads to 'positive changes in their relationships'.

San Francisco-based Chinese-American 
writer Kim Wong Keltner says she will raise her children in a more 
lenient way, since her own Tiger Mom upbringing was like an 'emotional 
jail'.

In her book, Tiger Babies Strike Back, which serves as a rebuttal to Tiger Moms, she explains that Asian-American children are overly-pressured to succeed.

Consequently, they are too scared to explore their creative sides or do anything rebellious, which means they often lack certain social skills as they get older.

'You have no outlet to be weird,' she explained.

'By the time you get to college, you don't even know how to be around people.

'You're super smart in your head but you can't navigate a simple social situation.'

While Amy Chua's book intimated that all Asian-American children are unemotional math experts and proteges, Mrs Keltner hopes to refute that.

'Asian-Americans are a lot more well-rounded than the stereotypes that are out there,' she said, adding: 'We are emotional.'

Mrs Keltner admits that Tiger Parenting does have its advantages, though, like teaching children that there is nothing they cannot achieve.

But problems arise when children feel they are never good enough. 'You're going to create a barrier with you and your parent, and you detach,' she explained.
