A teacher who had sex with a 'damaged' 15-year-old schoolgirl and streamed the sickening footage on the internet has been jailed.

William Hanna, 63, and his girlfriend Diane Whitehouse, 58, 'degraded' their young victim in the sordid sessions they held in a Birmingham hotel room, a court was told.

The couple, who said they thought the teenager was 18, met the schoolgirl online and used web cameras to stream the encounters.

A third man, Ian McGlasson, was also jailed for holding bondage sex sessions with the same victim.

Hanna - who was working as a teacher when he was arrested - was given seven years behind while his girlfriend, who he met on a swingers' website, was locked up for six years behind bars by a judge at Birmingham Crown Court.

The victim's mother discovered the abuse in 2010 after McGlasson, 47, sent her a Facebook
message in which he claimed to be her daughter's boyfriend.

She said she was haunted by seeing sickening images of her 'brainwashed' daughter online.

Nicholas
Cartwright, prosecuting, said that Hanna and Whitehouse filmed the 
encounters with the victim at the Etap hotel in Birmingham.

On one occasion, the court heard a stranger appeared in the room, dressed in a cat suit, and had sex with the 15-year-old.

The teenager, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was not a pupil at the school where Hanna taught.

Mr Cartwright said McGlasson also had sex with another 15-year-old girl.

Speaking after the case, the victim's mother said: 'I could not believe it. He was older than my own husband. I tried to get my daughter to 
go to the police, but she had been brainwashed good and proper.

'I spoke 
to the police and I would do it again in an instant. I found some of the pictures from the hotel room online and it was horrendous.

'That has damaged me forever. It's 
awful to know that it's your child when you recognise a mole on a 
stomach and a charm on a necklace.

'I am glad they were handed proper 
jail sentences, but I wish it had been for longer. It will never be over
for us. We have to live with this every day.

'I will always be paranoid and it has permanently damaged my daughter and our family.'

The victim's mother only discovered that Hanna had been a teacher during the court hearing.

She added: 'I just can't believe that 
he had been teaching when all this was going on. They read out glowing 
references, but he was doing these vile things.

'They sat shaking their heads 
throughout and tried to say they thought she was 18, but there was no 
disguising my daughter's age.

'Her Facebook had pictures of her in her school uniform. These people are in their late 40s, 
50s and 60s. I just hope that, if anybody else has been a victim of them
in the past, they have the bravery to come forward and speak to the 
police.

'I was terrified to go to court and 
face them. But I had to show that my daughter had a mother and there was
no way I was hiding from them.'

Passing
sentence, Judge Patrick Thomas QC said Hanna and Whitehouse had taken 
advantage of an 'intensely troubled and damaged child' and 'relished' 
her young age.

He told 
them: 'You treated her not as a damaged child who needed protection, but
as somebody who could be simply used as you wished.

'You involved her in sexual activity which must have had the effect of damaging her even further.'

Of the live streaming, the judge said:
'In addition to the degradation of that child, she knows an unknown 
number of people have had the opportunity to view that degradation.'

Sally Hancox, mitigating for Hanna, said the court case was a 'terrible legacy' for the final years of his teaching career.

Andrew Baker, mitigating for 
Whitehouse, said she had not been the prime mover and had only been 
involved in two of the four occasions sexual activity took place.

Former Frankley Community High School teacher Hanna, of Birmingham, was found guilty of inciting a child to be involved in pornography and three charges of sexual activity with a child.

Whitehouse, of Cannock, Staffordshire, was convicted of two charges of sexual activity with a chold.

McGlasson, of Reading, was jailed for six years for involving the same victim in bondage sessions.

He admitted six charges of sexual activity with a child, two of meeting a child following grooming and possessing and taking indecent images.

All three defendants were also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life.

A spokesman for Birmingham City Council, speaking on behalf of Frankley Community High School, said: 'William Hanna was arrested at his workplace in November 2010 and suspended on the same day.

'He was charged by police in November 2011 and sacked on the same day. The girl involved in this case did not attend the school and nobody at the school was involved in this case.'
