Avoided punishment: The BBC will not take disciplinary action against Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson

Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has escaped disciplinary action over his alleged use of the n-word while filming the hit BBC series.

In unaired footage the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'.

Despite the media storm surrounding the video, which was leaked in May, the BBC Trust has ruled out taking further action against Clarkson as the material had not been broadcast.

Several viewers have complained to the BBC Trust and asked it to review its decision not to take their complaints any further - after its senior complaints adviser said there was no case for the controversial presenter to answer. 

In a report published today, the Complaints and Appeals Board agreed that the 'incident did not engage editorial standards as the material had not been broadcast' and noted the BBC had left Clarkson 'in no doubt about how seriously we view this'.

It stated: 'The panel concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of success for an appeal.'

Shortly after the tape was made public, the BBC put Clarkson on a final warning and he wrote in his newspaper column that he believed he would be sacked by the broadcaster if he made another offensive remark.

Immediately after the video's release, Clarkson took to Twitter to deny he used the racist term and released a video statement saying he was ‘mortified and horrified’ that it sounded as though he had used it.

The TV presenter told his 3.3million Twitter followers that he had made every effort to make sure he did not use the slur, but realised it might have sounded as though he had.

In the video message posted on his official Twitter account he said: 'A couple of years ago I recorded an item for Top Gear, in which I quoted the rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny Moe.

Complaint: In the leaked video the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'

The presenter touched down in Vancouver, Canada, last week to film an episode of Top Gear

'Now, of course, I was well aware that in the best known version of this rhyme, there is a racist expression that I was extremely keen to avoid.

'The full rushes show that I did three takes. In two I mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur and in the third, I replaced it all together with the word "teacher".

'Now when I viewed this footage, several weeks later, I realised that in one of the mumbled versions, if you listen very carefully with the sound turned right up, it did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure.

'Ordinarily I don't respond to newspaper allegations, but on this occasion I feel I must make an exception.

'And I did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted.

'In fact, I have here the note I sent at the time to the production office.

'And it says, "I didn't use the n-word here but I've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like I did. Is there another take that we could use?"

'Please be assured I did everything in my power to not use that word.

'And as I'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for that fact that obviously my efforts weren't quite good enough.

'Thank you.'

Following Clarkson's frank video message, the BBC also released a statement which described the incident as 'regrettable'.

It said: 'Jeremy Clarkson has set out the background to this regrettable episode.

'We have made it absolutely clear to him the standards the BBC expects on-air and off.

'We have left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this.'

It was alleged that Mr Clarkson uttered the n-word during filming of the third episode of Top Gear series 19 as the star reviewed the £25,000 Toyota GT86 and the Subaru BRZ - which costs around the same amount.

Telling viewers that they may find it difficult to differentiate between the two vehicles he demonstrated how to do it using the child's counting rhyme.

Audio forensic experts studied the clip and suggested that, in their view, the presenter had used the word, which is deemed highly offensive.

In the version of the show which aired in February 2013 he was heard to say 'teacher'.

Despite his show of humility, some of Clarkson’s critics said the apology was ‘insufficient’ and demanded he be sacked.

Solicitor Lawrence Davies, who runs the Equal Justice law firm, responded to Clarkson's apology video by saying: ‘This explanation is just not credible. If he really wanted to avoid saying the N-word, he could easily have avoided reciting that rhyme altogether.

‘He deserves to be sacked for this. But the BBC have clearly brushed it under the carpet. They are too afraid to lose him.’
