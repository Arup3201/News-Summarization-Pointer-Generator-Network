Officer Darren 
Wilson's supporters staged a public rally on Saturday in Ferguson where 
they claimed Michael Brown's death was 'warranted and justified' and 
promised the cop their 'unwavering support.'

Having
 successfully raised $235,000 online for the controversial officer, The 
Support Officer Darren Campaign has become far more vocal in recent 
days, with the outdoor rally attracting a sizeable crowd in the bright 
afternoon sun.

One woman took issue with the pro-Wilson protest 10 miles south of Ferguson. Sondra Fifer, of St. Louis, told the protesters at Barney's Sports Pub in St. Louis: 'I'm not against officers, I'm against police brutality'

Addressed
 by a woman who, in a symbolic gesture of solidarity, declared her name 
was Darren Wilson, shared her supporters opinion that the Ferguson 
officer is the victim in the story.

Thanking the media for 
covering the event, the woman chastised reporters for showing 'strong 
bias against supporters of Officer Wilson.'

To
 large cheers, the woman said that she believes it is this that has 
'intensified the destruction of Ferguson' and declared that Wilson's 
supporters 'have no desire to engage with the negativity and hate which 
has stopped....the pursuit of justice.'

She denied that she and her followers were members of hate groups and said they respect every American's 1st Amendment rights.

'Will justice ever be attained if one sides supporters are living in fear of speaking out?' said the woman.

She added: 'We
 share the united belief that officer Wilson's actions on Aug. 9 were 
warranted and justified and he has our unwavering support.'

She
 then tried to end triumphantly with a rousing end to her address in 
which she righteously proclaimed 'We are all Darren Wilson.'

Meanwhile, a diverse group of protesters, many 
of them children, marched peacefully in protest of Brown's death Saturday as calm prevailed for a 
fourth straight day in the St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black 
18-year-old was shot by a white police officer, setting off more than a 
week of unrest.

Several
 community activists walked side-by-side with police officers in uniform
 as they walked down one of the main streets in Ferguson that had been 
filled with armored vehicles and officers in riot gear less than a week 
ago.

By late Saturday night, just a few dozen peaceful protesters remained, with an even more sparse police presence along the three-block stretch of West Florissant Avenue that had been the site of the heaviest unrest. Unlike other nights, the street remained open to traffic.

'I think some of the frustration is 
dying down because more information is coming out,' said Alana Ramey, 
25, a St. Louis resident who joined the afternoon march. 'I think there 
is more action going on. People are being more organized and that is 
helping.'

The protesters included a dozen students and recent graduates of Harvard University who arrived in Ferguson after a 20-hour drive. The Harvard contingent chatted amicably with Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who commended their passion and encouraged them to remain civically active.

'When we go back to our communities, there's a Ferguson near us,' said the Rev. Willie Bodrick II, 26, of Roxbury, Massachusetts, a youth minister and recent graduate of Harvard Divinity School.

Early
 Tuesday morning, GoFundMe announced on Twitter 'In regard to the 
"Officer Darren Wilson" campaign, donors' comments posted in violation 
of GoFundMe's terms have been removed.' 

Multiple comments left by people who donated money had been criticized on social media as racist. 

Several of those comments were compiled and published by Jon Hedren on Twitter. 

'Waste of good ammo. It's my privilege to buy you a replacement box,' one person said. 

Another wrote 'I support officer Wilson he did great job removing an unnecessary thing from the public!' 

Some
 Twitter users have criticized the page's existence, saying it violates 
GoFundMe's terms of service, which bans 'items that promote hate, 
violence, racial intolerance, or the financial exploitation of a crime.'

6,098 contributors in a little over a week.

That
 money 'will be used by the Brown family to cover funeral and burial 
expenses, travel and living expenses of the parents as they seek justice
 for their son, Michael Brown, Jr.,' according to the page, which is 
reportedly managed by lawyers for Brown's parents.

GoFundMe did not immediately return a request for comment from MailOnline.
