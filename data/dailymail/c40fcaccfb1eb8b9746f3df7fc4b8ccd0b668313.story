A six-year-old girl was dramatically rescued on Thursday after falling down a well 35 feet deep and just 12 inches wide.

Laylah Willett of Baldwin County, Alabama was on a school field trip to a farm in Greene County, Mississippi when the she fell down the seismograph hole.

The young girl was trapped for three terrifying hours until the local fire department was able to free her.

Once the rescue time arrived it took 45 minutes to get young Laylah back to the surface.

Until the rescuers arrived a local youth minister kept the little girl calm by talking to her and sending down a 
doll and some juice.

The rescue wasn’t without its problems. The hole was just large enough for the young girl to fall down but not big enough for an adult to fit down, so instead the rescue team had to use a harness.

That meant placing a lot of responsibility on young Laylah’s shoulders

'Just her age and maturity, would she be able to follow the instructions to get into the harness? And once we got her into the harness, it was just trying to keep her calm while we got her out,' Robert Pickering of the Hattiesburg Fire Department told WLOX13.

Another obstacle was that the girl was stuck in mud at the bottom of the hole and so once she was in a harness it took several attempts to get her unstuck and moving up the shaft.

When she finally emerged she was covered in mud, but not seriously injured.

She was taken to the hospital, but her only physical injuries were a neck scratch and slight bruising around her arms.

On Friday Laylah spoke to Local 15 News, still holding the doll sent down to her which she had named Lily.

In a horse voice she said 'bugs and dirt' was what she remembered from her ordeal.

'She was extraordinary. I couldn't believe how well she handled it. She's the bravest 6-year-old I know,' said her father Robert Willett.
