Heavily pregnant Zara Phillips looked blooming lovely as she joined fellow Royals for the family's annual Christmas Day church service at Sandringham.

Zara, who is eight months pregnant, swathed her impressive bump in a bright red jacket and matching hat for the service at St Mary Magdalene Church on the vast Norfolk estate.

The Olympian is due to give birth to her first child next month, and was accompanied to church by her husband, former England rugby star Mike Tindall.

Expecting: Zara, who was pictured outside the church with her cousin Princess Eugenie, is due to give birth to her first child next month

She carried a black Mulberry clutch bag and wore a pair of black gloves to help keep out the winter chill.

The mother-to-be chose to travel by car with her grandmother the Queen, while her 
husband walked alongside Zara's brother Peter Phillips as part of one of
 the longest Christmas Day processions of recent years.

As he left 
the service, Mr Tindall was heard remarking 'I feel a bit empty walking 
alone without a partner', as his wife waited to make the return journey 
with the Queen.

Gathering: Zara outside the church with Princess Beatrice and Sophie, Countess of Wessex

Laughter: Zara appeared to be sharing a joke with her cousins as she stood outside the church

Prior to the service, Zara appeared to have put comfort first as she paired a warm black winter coat with a pair of 
knee-high brown stretchy boots, complete with a small sturdy heel, and 
simple black leggings.

She wore her blonde hair loose and carried a black clutch bag in her gloved hands as she made her way into church.

 Mike looked smart in a black coat over grey trousers, a shirt and tie, 
as he walked into church with other family members, including the 
Duchess of Cambridge and Sophie, Countess of Wessex.

Zara, a world three-day event champion in 2006 and team silver medallist at last year's London Olympics, has been unable to compete in equestrian events since her pregnancy reached its later stages.

She was pictured early in her pregnancy competing in a show jumping event, but has since been channelling her energy into helping a race horse part owned by her husband become a champion.

Earlier this month the horse, Monbeg Dude, won the Majordomo Hospitality Handicap Steeple Chase at Cheltenham.

The 32-year-old reportedly branded her former England rugby captain husband an 'idiot' when he invested in the horse. But she revealed at Cheltenham races that the steed has been improving under her expert eye.

She said: 'We have just been getting him to move his feet a bit quicker and think about it a bit more because he is a good jumper.

'You can see now that he is so much more efficient over his fences. It makes the whole race easier for him. We just did exercise poles. He has come down to me about five times. We schooled him this week and he loved it. He was bouncing out of his skin.

As well as helping to get Monbeg Dude into shape during her pregnancy, Zara, who attended Prince George's christening in October as one of the baby's godparents, previously revealed she has taken up another hobby - baking.

The Olympian admitted: 'I have been a 
bit bored. I'm used to being on the go and active the whole time, and 
now it's quite different. So, yes, I'm baking. I love cooking and will 
definitely cook for the baby.'

And
 Mike added of her culinary skills: 'She’s a very good cook and cooks me
 everything. I cook too, but I’m the pudding guy – sticky toffee 
puddings, chocolate fondants and brownies.

'I'm very good at following a recipe whereas Zara’s good at putting her own twist on things.'

Mike,
 35, also revealed that he and Zara have no intention of finding out the
 sex of their baby before its birth - preferring to keep it a surprise.
