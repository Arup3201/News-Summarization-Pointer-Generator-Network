Boxing legend Muhammad Ali has been pictured with his family on his birthday following his latest spell in hospital.

Ali, who turned 73 on Saturday, was shown  with his daughter Maryum Ali, who uploaded a picture of the pair to Twitter.

The snap, apparently taken at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, showed the athlete, who has Parkinson's disease, in a chair with his daughter standing behind him.

She wrote: 'My father, aka. Muhammad Ali, is at home and looking forward to celebrating his 73rd Birthday tomorrow.'

He had been admitted to the hospital earlier this week as follow-up to a problem that surfaced last month.

A family spokesman said: 'He's home and resting and glad to be out of the hospital.

He added that Ali family 'greatly appreciates the outpouring of support and continued well wishes.'

The former three-time heavyweight world champion has been hospitalized twice in the past month.

Ali was first admitted on December 20 with what was believed to be a mild case of pneumonia.

But doctors later determined he was actually suffering from a urinary tract infection.

Ali, who is nicknamed The Greatest and the Louisville Lip, retired from boxing in 1981 with a 56-5 record.

He had not been pictured for months until the birthday photograph.

His public appearances have diminished in recent years due to his illness, but he still enjoys getting out and watching sports and visiting friends.

Ali appeared in public in September at a ceremony in his hometown of Louisville for the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards.

He did not speak to the crowd but posed for photos with award winners, including former NFL great Jim Brown.

Brown leaned over and whispered to the seated Ali during the photo session. Later, Brown said he told Ali: 'You're the greatest of all time.'

Ali and his wife, Lonnie, have homes in Arizona, Berrien Springs, Michigan; and Louisville, Kentucky.
