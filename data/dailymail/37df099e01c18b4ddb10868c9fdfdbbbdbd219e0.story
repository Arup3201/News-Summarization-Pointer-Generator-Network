He's known for being a maverick on and around the golf course, so it was no surprise to see Spanish star Miguel Angel Jimenez's unusual take on a daily workout.

The 50-year-old was caught hanging upside down from a piece of gym equipment that is mainly used for strengthening your upper body.

Rather than spending time tenuously lifting heavy weights, the cigar-smoking golf star decided to prepare for this weekend's BMW Masters in Shanghai by quite literally hanging around.

The European Tour's physio unit took to Instagram to show Jimenez larking around in the gym.

They wrote: 'Spotted the legend M A Jimenez hanging around in the gym using the equipment in his own unique way!! #bmwmasters'.

The European Tour veteran Jimenez, vice-captain for the last two Ryder Cups, doesn't seem to be too worried about the race for the 2016 Ryder Cup captaincy. 

Northern Irishman Darren Clarke is the early favourite and has the backing of heavyweights like world number one Rory McIlroy, nine-time Ryder Cup star Lee Westwood and two-time major winner Martin Kaymer.

Kaymer, however, said last week the reason behind his thinking was that 2016 was too early for the 43-year-old Bjorn as he was playing too well.

The growing campaign behind Clarke also saw Graeme McDowell call for McGinley to put aside differences with the Ulsterman after their friendship cooled when Clarke supported Montgomerie for the Gleneagles captaincy.

Jimenez is also a contender and would have the backing of the miracle of Medinah mastermind Jose Maria Olazabal.

It is expected a decision on the 2016 captain will be made early next year.
