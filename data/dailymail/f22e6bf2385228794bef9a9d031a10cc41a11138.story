Raekwon and Ghostface: Dan Lieberman tweeted the birth certificates for his baby boys - but is it just a stunt?

A U.S. man has taken his support for rap group Wu-Tang Clan to the extreme by naming his newborn twins Raekwon and Ghostface after two of the group's members.

Dan Lieberman yesterday tweeted the birth certificates for his baby boys, who will be officially known as Raekwon and Ghostface Lieberman, to complete more than 24 hours of live tweeting his wife's labour.

But the outrageous naming stunt could be just that - a publicity stunt timed amid growing hype for Wu Tang Clan's new album which has yet to be sold.

The new album is a single sale collector's item likely to never be released for wider public consumption.

Mr
 Lieberman posted a photo on Twitter holding the two birth certificates 
in front of his fast asleep newborns with the caption 'It's for the 
children'.

The
 original Raekwon himself then posted it on Instagram, saying 'This is 
live, family named their twins Raekwon and ghostface!!! #wu4thebabies'.

Not shy from expressing his thoughts 
online, Mr Lieberman sent numerous tweets during his wife's labour, 
including nicknaming her cervix Stonewall Jackson and his tongue in 
cheek idea to 'guilt the boys so hard' for putting their mother through 
24 hours labour with little progress.

The New York rap group Wu-Tang Clan was formed in the
 90s, comprising of nine colourfully named members such as Ol' Dirty 
B*****d, Masta Killa and Method Man.

Two members of Wu-Tang Clan, pictured in concert at London's Brixton Academy last year, have had twins named after them, just as hype for the group's new album gathers momentum for its valuable one-off sale

The group's new album is also unconventional. Once Upon A Time in Shaolin is a 31 song double album currently housed in a hand-carved nickel-silver box within a Moroccan vault.

A website promoting it claimed the album encapsulates 'the Clan's legendary dark funk and avant garde sound', and said it may never be released for public consumption.

It is to be a single sale collector's item and 'the first of its kind in the history of music'.
