North Korea stepped its war rhetoric today by threatening to go beyond carrying out a promised third nuclear test in response to what it believes are 'hostile' sanctions imposed after a December rocket launch.

The North frequently employs fiery rhetoric aimed at South Korea and the United States and in 2010 was blamed for sinking a South Korean naval vessel. It also shelled a South Korean island in the same year, killing civilians.

It did not spell out the actions it would take. The North is not capable of staging a military strike on the United States, although South Korea is in range of its artillery and missiles and it can hit Japan with its missiles.

'On a war footing': South Korean and U.S. troops began naval drills on Monday in a show of force partly directed at North Korea amid signs that Pyongyang will soon carry out a threat to conduct its third atomic test

'The DPRK (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, or North Korea) has drawn a final conclusion that it will have to take a measure stronger than a nuclear test to cope with the hostile forces nuclear war moves that have become ever more undisguised,' the North's KCNA state news agency said.

The United States and South Korea are staging military drills that North Korea says are a rehearsal for an invasion, something both Washington and Seoul deny.

The North successfully launched a long-range rocket in December in violation of U.N. resolutions that banned it from developing missile or nuclear technology after nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.

The North says that it has the sovereign right to launch rockets for peaceful purposes.

Its widely trailed third nuclear test was announced in response to the sanctions agreed in January, although satellite imagery indicates that the isolated and impoverished state has been readying its nuclear test site for more than a year.

Undeterred: North Korea leader Kim Jong Un has announced that it will carry out more rocket launches and a nuclear test after it was censured by the UN Security Council over the launch of the rocket in December

While most experts believe the North will stage a test, the timing is not known. It could come around February 16, the anniversary of former leader Kim Jong-il's birth.

Another unknown is what the North will use as fissile material. In the past it has used its diminishing supply of plutonium stocks, but is believed to have enriched weapons-grade uranium that would give it a second path to a nuclear bomb.

U.S. nuclear expert Siegfried Hecker, who visited a North Korean nuclear facility in 2010 believes the North could stage two explosions, one using plutonium to as to perfect its capacity to design a warhead small enough to be mounted on a missile, and a second using highly enriched uranium.

'Such (dual) tests have some technical limitations and are more challenging to conduct, but they have the huge advantage of not incurring additional political cost - in other words, they can get two for the price of one,' Hecker wrote in the February 4 issue of Foreign Policy magazine.

Pyongyang's two tests so far have been puny. The yield of the 2006 test is estimated at somewhat less than 1 kiloton (1,000 tons of TNT equivalent) and the second some 2-7 kilotons, compared with say 20 kilotons for a Nagasaki type bomb, Hecker wrote.

Provocative: North Korea has also posted a video on YouTube showing a 
simulated attack on the U.S. which includes this scene of a city 
resembling New York in flames and in ruins

Wiped out: The city disappears in a huge explosion similar to a nuclear detonation

North Korea has in the past used the 
leverage gained from its nuclear and rocket tests to try to restart 
six-party talks aimed at securing international recognition and aid for 
the country whose only major diplomatic backer is China.

There
 are few signs that the United States is willing to talk after the North
 rebuffed a food aid deal in March 2012 when it launched a long-range 
rocket after promising not to.

The threat of 'stronger' measures came after North Korea posted a chilling video depicting a U.S. city engulfed in flames after an apparent missile attack.

The footage, uploaded on YouTube by the North's official website, Uriminzokkiri, shows a city -- shrouded in the U.S. flag -- under attack, with its skyscrapers, including what appears to be the Empire State Building, either on fire or in ruins.

South Korea in turn released its own footage today of its successful satellite launch last week which was intended to strengthen its position as a technological powerhouse.

The prepares to swear in new President Park Geun-hye on February 25. Park had 
pledged talks and aid if the North gives up its nuclear ambitions.

Meanwhile, South Korea's U.N. ambassador Kim Sook said there are 'very busy activities' taking place at North 
Korea's nuclear test site 'and everybody's watching.'

Kim
 told a press conference that in the event of a nuclear test, he expects
 the U.N. Security Council to respond with 'firm and strong measures.'

North Korea announced last month that it would conduct a nuclear test to protest Security Council sanctions toughened after a satellite launch in December that the U.S. and others say was a disguised test of banned missile technology.

The council ordered North Korea in the sanctions resolution to refrain from a nuclear test or face 'significant action.'

South Korea joined the Security Council in January and holds the rotating presidency this month. Kim said he was speaking as South Korea's ambassador, not as the council president.

He said that during negotiations on the latest sanctions resolution all 15 council members - including North Korean ally China - were unified.

'They are very firm and resolute and I would expect very firm and strong measures to be taken in terms of format as well as in substance once they go ahead with such provocation' as a nuclear test, Kim said.
