A Nashville bar owner was convicted of second-degree murder on Friday for the fatal shooting of a country singer-songwriter.

Chris Ferrell, 46, had told jurors that he shot Wayne Mills in November 2013 in self defense. But Nashville jurors sided with prosecutors who argued that Ferrell intended to kill Mills when he shot him after a heated argument at his now-defunct bar.

Ferrell testified that the two got into an argument at his Pit and Barrel bar in the city's downtown area and that Mills threatened to kill him.

Nashville bar owner Chris Ferrell (pictured on Thursday) was found guilty of second-degree murder on Friday for shooting country singer Wayne Mills in the head during a heated argument at his now-defunct bar

Ferrell and singer Mills (pictured) were friends before the fatal shooting, according to family members in 2013

'I reached to the top of the cooler and retrieved my .22-caliber,' Ferrell said, according to The Tennessean. 'And I fired it. I fired in fear.'

Ferrell said he grabbed bar towels to try and stop the bleeding, but then began to panic and put an unloaded gun next to Mills.

'Why would that cause you to panic?' David Raybin, Ferrell's attorney, asked him.

'Because I thought I'd, because I thought I'd done something wrong at that point,' Ferrell said about the shooting, which happened at about 5am.

Mills toured primarily college campuses for more than 15 years as the lead singer of the Wayne Mills Band. Country music singers Jamey Johnson and Blake Shelton opened for the band before becoming stars

An autopsy found that Mills was shot in the back of the head. He also had two broken ribs, bruises and scrapes, according to WKRN. 

The jury reached their decision on the fifth day of trial that Ferrell was guilty. His attorneys said that they would appeal, according to The Tennessean.

Mills toured for more than 15 years as the lead singer of the Wayne Mills Band. Country music stars Jamey Johnson and Blake Shelton, as well as American Idol winner Taylor Hicks, all opened for the band in their early careers.

The Pit and Barrel bar, where Mills was killed, was supposed to be featured on an episode of the SPIKE TV reality show Bar Rescue the day after the shooting

Mills graduated from the University of Alabama with an education degree, and also played football for the school. He moved to Nashville in 2003.

The two men were previously friends, according to family members in 2013.

Following the night of the incident, SPIKE TV was set to feature the bar on its show Bar Rescue, which brings in a professional restaurant consultant to give struggling pubs a make-over. The network canceled the new episode and aired a re-run instead.

Ferrell faces 15 to 25 years in prison and will be sentenced on April 10. 

Ferrell testified in 2013 (pictured above) that he had received a dozen death threats since the killing - but insisted he acted in self defense
