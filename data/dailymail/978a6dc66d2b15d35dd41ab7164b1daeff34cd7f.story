A woman was left almost unrecognisable amid claims she was savagely beaten and raped by her ex-lover - when she refused to marry him.

Viri Benitez, from Tapachula in Mexico's south-eastern state of Chiapas, said she was getting ready to go to work when Fred Monoz Nataren, 25, turned up at her house demanding to see her.

The 23-year-old claims that Nataren then went 'mental', grabbing her by the hair and bundling her into his car when she refused his offer of a lift.

Ms Benitez said: 'I had finished with him a few weeks earlier because he was violent and I didn't want to marry him.

'When he arrived at my house I told him I was going to work and when he offered to take me and when I refused he went mental.'

Nataren is alleged to have driven Ms Benitez to an empty garage before breaking her nose and battering her with a dumbbell until she almost passed out.

Accused: Ms Benitez said her ex-boyfriend raped her as she lay in a pool of her own blood at the empty garage

She said: 'As he was beating me he was saying he was going to destroy my face so that no one would want to be with me. 

'He accused me of humiliating him. I begged him to stop but he just hit me harder until I was half-unconscious.'

He is then accused of raping her as she lay in a pool of her own blood.

'When he had finished he went outside and I gathered together enough strength to run to a nearby restaurant where some people helped me,' she added.

Police have launched a manhunt for Nataren and Ms Benitez has started a Facebook campaign in a bid to track him down.

The Facebook page has over 6,000 likes and carries photos of Nataren along with pictures of supporters holding banners saying: 'Viri's Case.'

A police spokesman said: 'An arrest warrant has been put out for the man and it will only be a matter of time until we find him.'
