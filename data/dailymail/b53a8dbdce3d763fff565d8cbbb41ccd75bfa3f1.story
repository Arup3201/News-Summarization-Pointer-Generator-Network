England captain Chris Robshaw has been challenged to raise his game to even greater heights on Saturday – to set the tone for a famous victory over the All Blacks.

The 28-year-old Harlequins flanker delivered a superb individual performance last Saturday at Eden Park, emphatically out-playing his iconic opposite number, Richie McCaw, as the tourists dominated the first Test for long periods before subsiding to a 20-15 defeat.

Yet, while Robshaw was a massive influence around the field, particularly with his ball-carrying and astute work as a link-man in attack, McCaw had a greater impact in terms of claiming turn-overs.

Poacher: The England skipper has a long way to go to match the All Blacks' leader in forcing turnovers

Given the crucial importance of breakdown poaching in a No 7’s repertoire, the England management have re-emphasised to their skipper the need to compete over the ball. Their demand for a greater ruck return is in keeping with the overall quest for a leap in standards this weekend, from an already impressive base.

Asked to reflect on Robshaw’s exploits in Auckland and what was expected of him in the second Test, forwards coach Graham Rowntree said: ‘He was industrious last week. I thought he had a good game. We have been through his game and there are things he has to be better at, but he knows that. He will be the last one off the training field, doing his extras.

‘I’m delighted with how he is going but he knows he’s going to have to come up another level tomorrow. For Chris, that means finding another level in everything he does, but there are more breakdowns than anything else in the game and that is one area we coach daily.’

England have recalled Tom Wood at blindside flanker in place of James Haskell, who was arguably their most effective breakdown asset at Eden Park. But Wood and Robshaw – aided and abetted by the likes of lock pair Joe Launchbury and Geoff Parling – led a ferocious rucking onslaught 18 months which was at the heart of a record victory over New Zealand at Twickenham.

That same raging intensity at the collision areas will be vital this time, if England are to disrupt the hosts’ possession and ensure their backs have quick ball to work with. That would allow them to set about dispelling the local perception that they want to play a slow, turgid game; a view which Rowntree took his turn to dismiss out of hand.

‘We want to play quick,’ said the former prop. ‘I was alarmed by some of the comments in the press this week saying we want to slow the game down. We want to play quick because we have a lightning-fast backline and a dynamic group of forwards, and that stadium will suit us.

‘In my opinion, the squad is a lot fitter – and I’m sure the data would back that up as well – than it ever has been. That is certainly helping the way we want to play. We want to play a challenging game and we want every tool available for a driving game or a quick game. We want everything.’

There was a degree of doubt about whether or not Forsyth Barr Stadium – with its roof-covered surface – would suit England’s kickers, after Jonny Wilkinson had some trouble shooting at goal there during the last World Cup. But the indications from training there this morning are that Owen Farrell and Freddie Burns endured no such problems.

‘Owen’s not missed a shot this morning,’ said Rowntree. ‘I was marvelling at how easy he makes it. Crikey, I’m glad I never had to do that for a living, under that pressure, but they both (Farrell and Burns) kicked well this morning.’

England have stocked their bench with high-calibre, heavyweight replacements, in the hope of blasting to victory in the final quarter against a tiring All Blacks defence. There will be a major onus on the visitors to maintain their intensity levels for the entire match, which they were unable to do last weekend.

‘You have to be able to play until the last 10 seconds,’ said Rowntree. ‘New Zealand have shown that, particularly in their victory in Ireland last autumn. We have to be pounding away at the end there. That's something we are constantly speaking about; being there and accurate in the last few seconds of the game. It's certainly a work-on for us.’
