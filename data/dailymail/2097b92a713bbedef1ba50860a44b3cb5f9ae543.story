A Penn State fraternity has been suspended for sharing offensive pictures.

According to police, several members of the Kappa Delta Rho fraternity posted photos to a secret Facebook page that showed mostly nude women who were 'sleeping or passed out,' drug sales and hazing rituals.

Authorities were able to obtain some of the photos with a search warrant, but by the time they arrived at the fraternity house all of the computers had been wiped clean.

The Daily Collegian reports that the page had about 144 members, which included current students and past alumni.

The first page, called Covert Business Transactions, was shut down after a female saw the page on a computer at the fraternity when one of the members left his computer on, and realized there was a topless photo of her that had been posted.

She threatened the men, though unknown to her the page was moved to a new group, this one called 2.0.

A former member who was invited to join gave police his account so they could gather evidence, and from this they were able to get 20 photos posted, that should nude photos and drugs including 'marijuana, edibles, concentrates, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication and some cocaine.'

He said in a statement to authorities; 'This is the type of stuff that happens at KDR.' 

Now, the fraternity has been shut down while it is being investigated by law enforcement. 

'In response to the discovery of the two Facebook pages allegedly hosted by Kappa Delta Rho, the chapter was immediately placed on full chapter suspension by Penn State’s Interfraternity Council,' the IFC said in a statement.

'Upon completion of all investigation into this matter, Kappa Delta Rho will be summoned by the IFC to undergo a conduct review session.'

Police are now going through the photos they obtained and trying to identify the victims, though no arrests have been made at this time. 

'The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive and inconsistent with the university community's values and expectations,' Damon Sims, Penn State's vice president for student affairs, said in a news release. 

Joseph S. Rosenberg, executive director of Kappa Delta Rho, said in a statement; 'Kappa Delta Rho stands for the values of contributing to our campus and broader communities, enhancing the character of our members, and respecting the rights of all who interact with our fraternity through any of our chapters. 

'Upon learning from officials at Penn State that the KDR chapter at the university had been placed on full chapter suspension, our national leadership immediately examined the facts available to us at this time. In accordance with that review, we have placed the chapter on suspension for the remainder of this semester and we are conducting a full membership review and reorganization. 

'We have informed the appropriate agencies and the university’s investigation and disciplinary process. Upon the completion of that investigation, we will evaluate these further findings and make a decision regarding the Penn State chapter that is appropriate for all parties. 

'The national leadership of Kappa Delta Rho is committed to hold our brothers accountable for their actions. We embrace the principle of respect for all persons and we will adhere to that principle in this matter.'
