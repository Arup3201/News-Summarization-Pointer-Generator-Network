David Cameron is promising to fight back against an ‘unholy alliance’ attacking plans for a new high speed rail line after admitting the Government has failed to make an effective case for the project.

As ministers brace themselves for a highly critical Parliamentary report on HS2 - the biggest rail project in Britain for more than a century - the Prime Minister launched a passionate defence of it.

‘I would urge the doubters to think big and what this can mean for the country. I accept the government needs to step up and make a really powerful argument,’ said Mr Cameron, speaking at the G20 summit in St Petersburg.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is expected to respond to a critical report from MPs on the spiralling costs of HS2 next week with a major speech making a fresh case for the potential economic benefits.

There is also speculation that Mr Cameron may appoint a dedicated ‘minister for HS2’ in a Government reshuffle expected after next month’s Conservative party conference.

Currently, it is among the responsibilities of transport minister Simon Burns. Some suggest former Labour transport secretary Lord Adonis, one of the main cheerleaders for the project, could be asked to take on the role for the Government.

Objectors say it will cost too much to get HS2 up and running from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. The official cost of the project, including contigency funds, has recently climbed from £33 billion to £42.6 billion.

Former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Mandelson, ex-chancellor and former transport secretary Alistair Darling, and ITV chairman and former Tory MP Archie Norman have all cast doubt on the scheme in recent weeks.

The objectors, who also include David Cameron’s stepfather-in-law Viscount Astor, say the project will cause an unacceptable level of environmental damage, loss of homes and disruption to many communities.

But Mr Cameron attacked those who have criticised the project - singling out Lord Mandelson, the leader of UKIP and the Financial Times newspaper, which has repeatedly cast doubt on the economic case.

‘There has never been a blank cheque for HS2 but I’m passionately in favour of this project and we need to respond to the criticism that’s been made,’ the Prime Minister.

‘There’s an unholy alliance between the Financial Times, Peter Mandelson and Nigel Farage who want to give up on projects to make our country competitive and fit for the 21st century.

‘Every other country in the world has got on board for high speed rail.

‘I absolutely refuse to accept we can have a booming south-east corridor closest to the continent and rest of the economy won’t benefit.’

Citing the success of the Olympics and the Crossrail project, currently under construction, the Prime Minister aded: ‘We need to fight back with a vigorous campaign we can do extraordinary things in terms of infrastructure.

‘I would urge the doubters to think big and what this can mean for the country. I accept the government needs to step up and make a really powerful argument.’

The Prime Minister argues that HS2 is essential if Britain is to be a winner in the so-called ‘global race’. Britain lags far behind high-speed rail developments in countries such as Saudi Arabia – which has 342 miles – and Morocco, with 422 miles.

Downing Street sources said similar objections now raised against HS2 had been made in decades gone by to the M25, Channel Tunnel and Jubilee Line.

Nick Clegg warned London’s status as a ‘global powerhouse’ will be threatened if the High Speed 2 rail line does not go ahead.

The Deputy Prime Minister claimed the UK is a ‘laggard’ when it comes to investing in transport infrastructure, and can no longer compete with the rising cities of China and Brazil.

Following a summer of criticism of the rising costs of the project, Mr Clegg made an impassioned defence of HS2, saying connecting the capital to the northern cities was the only way to prevent a ‘never ending sprawl across the green belt outside of London.’
