Vandals ironically daubed graffiti on a £650,000 Banksy mural - just hours before a wealthy philanthropist paid to stop the iconic artwork being removed.

The elusive artist, whose identity is a jealously-guarded secret, painted three 1950s-style spies on the side of a £300,000 semi-detached house in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in April this year.

But this week, vandals scratched a name into one of the spies' sunglasses, before messily scribbling it out.

Vandals attacked one of Banksy's pieces of street art in Cheltenham by scribbling on one of the character's sunglasses - just hours before a millionaire stepped in to stop it being removed from the wall

The artwork featuring three spies, which is inspired by the town's GCHQ,
 was painted on the side of a semi-detached house by the elusive artist 
in April this year- and soon became the subject of an ownership war

Banksy made his name as an artist through his graffiti art, which he creates in secret, usually in public places.

The vandalism came just hours before a millionaire stepped in to ensure the artwork stayed in place for the community. 

After the piece was created, the GCHQ-inspired artwork became the centre of an ownership war.

Both the community and an art collector wanted to buy the piece from the homeowner.

An art 
collector offered to buy it from the homeowner and have it scraped off 
the wall but the community wanted the painting to stay put

To abate the row, Cheltenham Borough Council issued a temporary notice to stop anyone undertaking any work to the listed property, which would include removing the painting.

But
 just hours before the notice ran out, Hekmat Kaveh stepped 
in and offered the homeowner an undisclosed fee to leave the artwork in
 place for the community.

Mr
 Kaveh said: 'Having spoken to many people over the last few weeks, and 
reading many comments on social media, I have concluded that there is a 
very strong feeling about this work.

'It
 seems that Cheltenham generally is in support of, not only retaining 
the Banksy in the town, but in its current location, where it was 
clearly intended to be.'

Hekmat Kaveh offered the homeowner an undisclosed sum to keep the painting in place just hours before a temporary notice put in place by Cheltenham Borough Council - which stopped anyone 
doing any work to the listed building - expired

The move has been welcomed by the Save the Banksy Group, who had raised £115,000 towards buying the work.

Group leader Angela de Souza said: 'I am sure the whole town extend their gratitude to Mr Kaveh for stepping in like this to prevent the loss of this artwork.'

The move is still subject to receiving agreement from council planners, listed building authorities, the Highways Agency and Cheltenham Borough Council - but most have already expressed support.

Speaking about the vandalism, Cheltenham’s
 own street artist Dice67 - who previously put a layer of protective paint over the
 work to stop the piece being defaced - said: 'It’s never nice to see someone defacing street art.

'But 
at the end of the day, when you go out and paint on the street, that is 
what happens sometimes. That is the nature of the game.'
