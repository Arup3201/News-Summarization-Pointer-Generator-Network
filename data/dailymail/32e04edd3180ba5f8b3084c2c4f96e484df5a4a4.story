A generous taxi driver has become an overnight celebrity in China after he found a huge bundle of cash in the back of his cab - and promptly returned it to its rightful owner.

Zhao Lei discovered 170,000 yuan (£16,200) in a paper bag on the back seat of his taxi after taking a young couple to a car dealership in Harbin, in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang.

Instead of keeping the huge haul - likely to be at least three times his annual salary - he handed it in to the company which he works for.

Lucrative: The total value of the cash was 170,000 yuan, the equivalent of £16,200

The firm contacted the passengers, who said they had been carrying so much cash in order to pay for a new car, and returned the money.

The delighted couple tried to offer Mr Zhao 10,000 yuan as a reward for his honesty, but he refused to accept the cash.

'It's what I have to do,' the driver said after news of his exploits came to light.

'Anyone who lost such a big amount of money will go crazy. I won't take advantage of that.'

GDP per person in China is around £4,500, meaning that the bounty discovered by Mr Zhao represents an enormous reward for the average Chinese person.

Taxi drivers earn less than 5,000 yuan a month for working punishing 14-hour shifts, six days a week.

The story of Mr Zhao's selflessness is likely to be held up as an example of community spirit by the Chinese media, in contrast to a wave of stories demonstrating the increasing individualism of the country's society.

In 2011, a little girl who was run over by two cars was seen on camera bleeding to death while nearly 20 passers-by simply ignored her plight.

President Xi Jinping has introduced the concept of the 'Chinese Dream' in a bid to ensure that citizens retain their sense of social solidarity as the country grows wealthier and more westernised.
