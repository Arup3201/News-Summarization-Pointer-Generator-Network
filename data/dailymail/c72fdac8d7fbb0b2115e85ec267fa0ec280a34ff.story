Murdered: Father-of-three Dean Armitage, 49, who was killed as he tried to stop a thief stealing his Range Rover from the driveway of his home

A car thief who murdered a father-of-three on his driveway as he was making off with the family Range Rover has been jailed for life.

Burglar David Sindall, 34, clubbed Dean Armitage on the head with a heavy metal torch as the businessman fought him outside his family home in Hoyland, South Yorkshire.

The blow sent Mr Armitage crumpling to the driveway's concrete surface, shattering his skull, where Sindall punched and kicked him before fleeing.

He never regained consciousness and died three weeks later.

Sindall, a career burglar who had previously been jailed for armed robbery, had been drinking before breaking into 49-year-old Mr Armitage's home through an unlocked back door at 3.15am.

He discovered the keys to the haulage firm boss's Range Rover in the kitchen and decided to use them to make off with the vehicle.

Mr Armitage was alerted to the theft by the sound of the car's engine starting, and he rushed out in his underwear and pulled open the driver's-side door.

A scuffle ensued, with Sindall telling the businessman: 'I'm gonna show thee.. f***ing seriously.. show thee.'

As Mr Armitage tried to pull Sindall from the driver's seat the crook struck him a 'heavy blow' to the left side of his head with a lit torch, then punched and kicked him before running off.

The now unconscious Mr Armitage - who leaves three children, Charlotte, Chloe and Josh - had suffered a massive skull fracture at the back of his head.

He was taken to Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital where despite neurosurgery he never woke up. He died on Friday, August 9, three weeks after the incident.

Sindall, of Eastwood, Rotherham had admitted manslaughter buy was found guilty of murder after a trial by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court.

Jailing him for life with a minimum 
term of 24 years, Mr Justice Stephen Males told him: 'While Dean 
Armitage was man who built a business and a home for his family by his 
hard work you are a man who preferred to get this by stealing them.'

He
 said Mr Armitage had rushed out to defend his property 'as he was 
entitled to' and was punched in the jaw and body with 'considerable 
force' leaving him insensible and bleeding.

The
 judge told the defendant; 'Thinking only of yourself you ran off. As 
you did so you literally added insult to injury by shouting foul-mouthed
 abuse at him.'

Killer: Burglar David Sindall, 34, clubbed Mr Armitage on the head with a heavy metal torch, sending him crumpling to the ground and shattering his skull, where the thief kicked and punched him before running away

Neighbour Trevor Thornton, who witnessed the attack, said he saw Sindall kick and punch Mr Armitage as he was down on the ground before he ran off.

Sindall took shopping he had stolen from the house to a friend's who described him as 'panicking and paranoid.' He told his friend: 'I might have killed somebody.'

The court heard that Sindall, who was given a five-year jail term in 2006 for armed robbery, had been drinking in nearby pubs until 12.45am.

The defendant told jurors he had found the house door 'ajar' and took the keys, a handbag and some shopping bags before trying to start the vehicle.

He claimed he had been trying to get it into gear when Mr Armitage came out and grabbed him in the driver's seat.

'He was trying to haul me out. I just pushed him, my intention was to get some space between me and him so I could get away. I pushed him and he went backwards,' he said.

'It all happened so fast. He stumbled back, I didn't see him hit the floor. At no point did I have any intention of hurting him, unfortunately he smacked his head, didn't he?'

But prosecutor Graham Reeds QC Reeds told the court: 'The prosecution say that if you deliberately hit a person over the head with an implement targeted to a vulnerable area like the temple or with sufficient force to make that person go weak at the knees and stumble whilst at the same time shouting "I'll show thee. F***ing seriously' and that when the victim is insensible on the ground at least one further blow is delivered by a kick, well then what else can be intended but to cause really serious harm.'

Mr Armitage's widow widow Mandy, 48, who was office manager in the family business, said in a victim impact statement: 'Dean was cruelly taken from me trying to stop someone stealing our car from our driveway.

'Someone who thought it was OK to take things from other people rather than work hard to pay for their own things like Dean did.'

She said: 'My husband Dean meant the world to me. Losing him is the hardest thing I have ever had to suffer.'

After the hearing Detective Inspector Kevin Brown who led the inquiry said: 'I'm really pleased with the verdict. It was a difficult case that involved a lot of experts giving their opinion on the cause of the injuries.

'This case is heartbreaking and devastating for Mr Armitage's family. He was a hard-working, caring and honest man. While trying to protect his family and his home he tragically lost his life at the hands of Sindall.'
