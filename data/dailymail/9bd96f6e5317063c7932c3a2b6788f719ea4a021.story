A schoolgirl was hospitalised for four days after smashing out eight front teeth on a log during a horror fall.

Jeni Nichol was left covered in blood and screaming after toppling from a wooden climbing frame during a three-day adventure trip.

Her face hit a wooden plank, knocking out two teeth and crushing another six,  on a trip to Lea Green Learning and Development Centre near Matlock, Derbyshire.

After various attempts to mend the damage, surgeons at Royal Derby Hospital admitted they could not replace the lost teeth, and the other six would have to be removed.

Six of the teeth were her adult teeth and the young girl now faces having to wear a denture plate for the rest of her life.

But the swelling around her gums is still so severe dentists still cannot say for definite whether even this will be an option.

'I hit my face on the edge of the step and screamed. There was a lot of blood and a lot of pain.'

Teacher Mrs Lee said: 'There was blood everywhere. They tried to wire the teeth to her gum but all the sockets were smashed to bits so they couldn't.

'She had to stay in hospital for four days and was on a drip.'

A Derbyshire County Council spokesman said: 'The safety of children visiting Lea Green is always our top priority and we're sorry that Jeni was hurt.

'We've carried out a thorough 
investigation following the accident which found that all proper safety 
measures had been carried out, the equipment had been checked, and 
appropriate supervision was in place.

'Lea Green has an excellent safety record but adventurous activities do carry an element of risk.'
