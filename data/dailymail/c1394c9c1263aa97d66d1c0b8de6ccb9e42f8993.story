When Danielle Cornwall-Nash appeared on ITV's dating show Take Me Out in 2013 she hoped to find love and live happily ever after.

Now the 24-year-old's dream has come true after she got engaged on New Year's Eve - but not to the man she met on TV.

However the matchmaking show presented by Paddy McGuinness can take some credit for the engagement as Danielle's fiance, Luke Hobson, 24, got in touch after seeing her on the box.

Big screen proposal: Luke Hobson popped the question to Danielle Cornwall-Nash via a digital billboard on Blackpool Promenade's North Pier

Danielle, from Blackpool, and Leeds-born Luke had been student sweethearts but lost touch after they graduated from university. But seeing Danielle appear on TV prompted Luke to seek her out again.

As well as their shared history, they had something else in common since graduating - Luke had also failed to find love on television.

He had appeared on Sky's dating show Love Machine, hosted by former Radio One DJ Chris Moyles and X Factor finalist Stacey Solomon, which was also aired last year.

No likey, no lighty: Dannii won a date on the show but the romance didn't last

After seeing Danielle had also been on TV, Luke sought her out and asked her if she wanted to meet up as 'fellow failed dating show contestants.'

Danielle had been picked to go on a date on her fifth appearance on Take Me Out - the popular Saturday night show with the catchphrase 'no likey, no lighty' (as the female contestants turn off their lights if they don't like the male contestant who appears). But while she got on well with Dan from London who she met on the show, their romance did not last.

Luke then contacted her out of the blue asking her out.

Luke explains: 'We met six years ago in Leeds and we dated for a while. But we were young and went our separate ways when she finished uni and went back to Blackpool.

Reunited: Luke, who had been on Sky dating show Love Machine, contacted Dannii - a former university flame - after seeing her on Take Me Out

'We hadn't spoken to each other for about four or five years, but when I saw her on Take Me Out I text her and suggested we meet up as fellow failed dating show contestants.'

The pair met for a drink on Valentine's Day, 2013, and have been together ever since.

Luke said: 'It's just one of those things. When we met up again we didn't have to go through dating as we knew each other so well from before.'

Then Luke delighted Danielle, who is currently seven months pregnant with his son, on New Year's Eve - which is also her birthday - by popping the question.

Thanks to their TV appearances, he gave her a fitting proposal involving a big screen at Blackpool  Promenade's North Pier.

Fitting: As they had both been on television, Luke thought a big screen was appropriate for his proposal

Luke said: 'With us both having been on TV I wanted to do something to make a show out of the proposal, and I knew she'd love it. We were in Blackpool for New Year so I asked all her old friends and her family to be there for it.'

The couple, who live in Leeds, hope to get married next year.

Danielle said: 'I didn't have a clue that Luke was about to propose. I just thought we were going out because it was my birthday as well.

'Then I came out onto the Prom and saw the photograph on the screen and wondered what was going on. I was speechless. It was such a thoughtful and lovely thing to do.'
