The pressure increased on embattled Gold Coast Titans star Greg Bird as it was revealed he allegedly supplied cocaine at his own buck’s party and the day after his wedding.

Details of Bird’s charges came to light before the player appears in court next week with four other current and former Titan players.

The Courier Mail reported that the NSW Origin star and former Titans co-captain has denied the allegations and will look to prove his innocence in court.

Greg Bird, pictured playing for Australia against England, allegedly supplied cocaine at his own buck's night

Court documents allegedly show that Bird’s two counts of supplying cocaine stem from dates in November and December last year, the same time as his buck’s party and the day after his wedding. 

On the same night as the second allegation Bird was caught urinating on a police car in public in Byron Bay. It was an incident that later cost him the co-captaincy of his side.

Titans players Beau Falloon and Jamie Dowling along with Queensland Reds vice-­captain Karmichael Hunt will face Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday after they were the first footballers charged over the cocaine controversy.

The buck’s party for Bird in Byron bay had several NRL players in attendance. In particular one-time Titans teammate Joe Vickery, who faces seven counts of supplying cocaine.

None of Vickery’s charges relate to the time of Bird’s buck’s party. 

Bird, Falloon, Dowling, Dave Taylor and Kalifa Faifai Loa have all been stood down by the Titans and will miss the club’s first NRL game of the season against Wests Tigers on Saturday.
