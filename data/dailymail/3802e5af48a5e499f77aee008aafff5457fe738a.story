IT could be a remote Alpine landscape. But this was Cumbria at the weekend after northern England was hit by an icy blast and a spectacular covering of snow.

Fair-weather hikers who frequent the desolate uplands stayed indoors while skiers, like this one enjoying the solitude of the hills around Alston, revelled in the conditions.

Most of the country will face bitterly cold temperatures for much of the week. Counties along the east coast are likely to be hit by sleet and snow over the next 48 hours.

But the so-called ‘Beast from the 
East’ – a cold front heading in from Russia – is not now expected to 
bring the heavy snowfall that has caused chaos in recent winters.

A Met Office spokesman said wintry 
showers will hit areas along the east coast, but the sleet and snow is 
unlikely to penetrate more than 20 or 30 miles inland.

Temperatures by Wednesday night could
plunge as low as -8C (18F) in the North, Midlands, Wales and the South 
West. Motorists were warned to beware of heavy overnight frosts and 
freezing fog.

The Met Office has issued cold weather alerts for the whole of the UK urging people to ensure those who are vulnerable and elderly are safe and warm.

Tony Waters, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster, said: 'After a brief milder spell this weekend we are expecting the coldest spell of the winter so far to develop across the UK next week.

'Eastern and southeastern coastal counties can expect to see the most frequent snow showers, but a few will probably spread further inland to central parts as the week goes on.

'With temperatures falling well below
freezing at night, lying snow and the formation of ice could lead to 
some treacherous conditions and possible disruption to travel.'

It also warned the ice and snow is 
here to stay until February and in all likelihood will be colder than 
the same period last year, bringing snow and sleet.

A spokesman said: 'On balance, it 
seems most likely that many areas will receive average amounts of rain. 
With temperatures generally below average, this would suggest that there
is a increased chance of snow.'

A top health chief also warned that 
people with health problems are in serious danger from the biting 
weather. Last year there were 24,00 deaths, a significant number of elderly among them.

Public Health Minister Anna Soubry, said: 'It's really important people look after themselves and be good neighbours to older friends in the cold weather.

'In the winter older people and those with long term conditions are more likely to suffer heart attacks and strokes, respiratory illnesses can get worse, and there is the risk of falls on slippery ground.

'The NHS is well prepared for an increase in winter-related health problems which are typical at this time of year. Preparations are made across the NHS annually and these are now in place in every area of England.'

The Beast from the East has already sparked heavy snowfall in France, Croatian and Holland, causing flight cancellations and severe disruption.
