With winter fast approaching, it only means one thing: the dreaded flu season is coming.

Every year Australians book more than 80,000 doctors' appointments for cold and flu related illnesses alone which could be prevented by their decisions in Autumn, according to scientists.

Now is the perfect time to get ready to resist the first wave of cold or flu this winter.

Our lifestyle decisions in Autumn are key to ensure a sickness-free flu season, according to Sheila Zhou, expert Scientist at USANA, leading producer of high quality supplements.

'Summer is officially over, and with the cooler months often associated with sneezing, coughing, and fevers, it's no surprise many of us aren't happy about it.

For those stressing about getting sick during flu season, the secret is to just relax! Literally, meditate

'Staying healthy during this time however, doesn't have to be difficult.

'By implementing a cold and flu prevention regimen before Winter starts will boost your immune system significantly.'

Just 20 minutes of sunshine a day is the secret ingredient to ensuring a healthy immune system.

'Vitamin D is the key to strengthening the immune system,' said Ms. Zhou.

'If you have a sufficient storage of Vitamin D through Summer then it should last 30 to 60 days through the colder, darker months.'

Vitamin D is vital for many areas of health including the absorption of calcium, preventing osteoporosis and regulating various cells in the immune system.

1. Soak up the sunshine

A significant number of Australians are deficient in vitamin D. Did you know that just 20 minutes of sunlight each day significantly boosts the production of vitamin D in your body? Vitamin D not only helps protect your body in maintaining healthy immune function, but it also assists in general wellbeing. Unfortunately, with the days getting shorter and the daylight hours diminishing, winter can be a difficult time to get the necessary sunshine, so supplements such as USANA's Vitamin D can be beneficial.

2. Drink like a fish

Like any other time of year, staying hydrated during winter is extremely important. Even though you may not feel as thirsty or sweat as much during the cooler months, drinking plenty of water is still essential to help eliminate waste and prime your body against infections from pathogens.

3. Get Moving

Never underestimate the importance of regular activity. Exercising is of course a great way to get into shape, but it also increases the number of natural killer cells in our bodies that fight off infection. So even if you only have time to walk around the block, making the effort goes a long way in keeping you healthy and infection free as the weather cools down.

4. Get creative in the kitchen

Eating brightly coloured fruit and vegetables is also a great way to keep infections at bay. They are rich in vitamin C and E and antioxidants. Their ability to increase the functionality of your immune system means that adding these fresh fruits and vibrant veggies to your daily diet helps your body safe guard itself from nasty viruses, while tasting delicious too!

5. Stress Less

You're probably aware that stress isn't good for you, but very few people are aware of how much it actually impacts your health. Stress takes an enormous toll on the immune system and makes you more vulnerable to everything from a common cold to major diseases. So if you don't already, make sure you get enough sleep and take time out to do the things you enjoy. 

The kitchen is another place to start preparing the body for winter as a plate full of colourful foods has been proven to help keep a cold at bay 

Considering Australians live in a mostly sun soaked land, statistics show that a huge proportion do not get enough rays, resulting in the significant number of Aussies who are deficient in Vitamin D. 

'99% of skin cancers are caused by sun exposure, so understandably people are scared to go out too much,' said Ms Zhou.

'But sun exposure is really important, as long as people put on sunscreen.'

'At least 41 per cent of women are actually vitamin d deficient. '

'People need sunshine to boost their immune system before winter. There are amounts of vitamin D in what we eat, but not nearly enough to rely on those foods alone.'

Another tip for people stressing out about getting sick? Relax!

'Stressing less is crucial, but it is hard to tell modern people to live stress-free lives!' said Ms Zhou.

'It's the first thing to prioritise, whether it means yoga, meditation or exercise.'

Sleep is another crucial step to boosting the immune system; ideally around six to eight hours of good quality sleep every night.

A colourful plate will help keep a cold at bay.

'Different coloured foods are crucial for the immune system, because different vegetables and fruit each provide different antioxidants,' said Ms Zhou.

'They are also rich in vitamins C and E which are very important for the immune system.'

So what should go on our plates?

'To have sufficient vitamins and minerals the Australian dietary guidelines recommend having half a plate of salad with a variety of vegetables of different colours,' said Ms Zhou.

'That should be accompanied by a quarter of protein and a quarter of carbohydrate, including wholegrains or red, black or brown rice.'
