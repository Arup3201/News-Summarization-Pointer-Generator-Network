The president and CEO of the railway's parent company says an employee failed to properly set the brakes of the train that crashed into a town in Quebec, killing at least 15 people while another 45 remain missing.

Edward Burkhardt made the comments during a visit Wednesday to the town that was devastated by the runaway oil train four days ago.

'It was questionable whether hand brakes were put I place at this time,' Burkhardt said.

'I don't think any employees removed brakes. They failed to set the brakes.'

'I think he did something wrong ...We think he applied some hand brakes but the question is did he apply enough of them.

'He said he applied 11 hand brakes we think that's not true. Initially we believed him but now we don't.'

What went wrong: Safety inspectors search the wreckage for clues on Wednesday as they try to determine the cause of the crash. The company president made the announcement about the brakes today as well

He said a train engineer has been suspended without pay.

All told, 15 bodies have been found but they are so badly burned that they are unidentifiable.

That
number does not include the 15 people whose bodies were burnt so badly 
that they are unidentifiable, bringing the total number up to 60.

Burkhardt said that he had stayed in Chicago to deal with the crisis in his office, where he was better able to communicate with insurers and officials in different places during what he described as 20-hour work days.

At a press conference, shortly before Burkhardt was due to arrive in Lac-Megantic, Quebec Premier Pauline Marois faulted the company's response in the wake of the disaster.

'We have realized there are serious gaps from the railway company from not having been there and not communicating with the public,' Marois said.

She also announced a $60million fund to help victims in Lac-Megantic and to rebuild the town.

Burkhardt
visited the devastated town a day after police announced they were 
pursuing a painstaking, wide-ranging criminal investigation of the 
inferno ignited by the derailment of the oil train that demolished the 
center of this lakeside town of 6,000.

Flanked
by reporters at Montreal's Trudeau airport Tuesday evening, Burkhardt 
suggested firefighters who extinguished an earlier fire on the same 
train shared some of the blame.

'We
have responsibility for this incident. We don't have total 
responsibility but we have partial responsibility,' Burkhardt said in 
remarks broadcast on CTV.

Quebec
police inspector Michel Forget announced Wednesday morning that the 
number of missing had risen to 60, a number that included the 15 bodies 
recovered so far that have been burnt beyond recognition. Police had 
earlier put the number of missing at 50.

Mr
Forget said the numbers remained in flux as reports of missing people 
trickled in or people believed to be missing turned out to be alive.

Mr
Forget had earlier ruled out terrorism as a cause, but said that an 
array of other possibilities remain under investigation, including 
criminal negligence. Other officials have raised the possibility that 
the train was tampered with before the crash early Saturday.

'We're not at the stage of arrests.'

The
heart of the town's central business district is being treated as a 
crime scene and remained cordoned off by police tape - not only the 30 
buildings razed by the fire but also many adjacent blocks.

On
downtown's main street - Rue de Laval - police positioned a truck near 
the perimeter of the no-go zone, which prevented news crews from getting
direct photo and video views of the search operations being conducted 
by some 200 officers.

Police
officials left no doubt that the hunt for the missing people was taxing
- they said two officers were withdrawn from the sector because of 
worries about their physical condition.

'This
is a very risky environment,' said Quebec Provincial Police Sgt. Benoit
Richard. 'We have to secure the safety of those working there. We have 
some hotspots on the scene. There is some gas.'

The
Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway train broke loose early Saturday
and hurtled downhill through the darkness nearly seven miles (11 
kilometers) before jumping the tracks at 63 mph (101 kph) in 
Lac-Megantic, in eastern Quebec near the Maine border, investigators 
said. All but one of the 73 cars were carrying oil. At least five 
exploded.

Rail dispatchers 
had no chance to warn anyone during the runaway train's 18-minute 
journey because they didn't know it was happening themselves, 
Transportation Safety Board officials said.

Such warning systems are in place on busier lines but not on secondary lines, said TSB manager Ed Belkaloul.

At
the center of the destruction is the Musi-Cafe, a popular bar that was 
filled at the time of the explosion, which also forced about 2,000 of 
the town's 6,000 residents from their homes.

By
Tuesday, only about 800 were still barred from returning to their 
houses, though residents were cautioned to boil tap water before 
drinking it.

Efforts 
continued to stop waves of crude oil spilled in the disaster from 
reaching the St. Lawrence River, the backbone of the province's water 
supply.

Investigators 
searching for a cause of the accident are looking closely at the fire 
that happened on the train less than an hour before it got loose while 
parked in the nearby town of Nantes.

The
train's engine was shut down - standard operating procedure dictated by
the train's owners, Nantes Fire Chief Patrick Lambert said. Burkhardt 
suggested that shutting off the locomotive to put out the fire might 
have disabled the brakes.

'The
train had the engine shut down by the firemen, they didn't do that for 
malicious purposes by it's what happens,' Burkhardt told reporters at 
the Montreal airport.

'The 
firemen should have roused the locomotive engineer who was in his hotel 
and taken him to the scene with them. But it's easy to say what should 
have happened. We're dealing with what happened.'

Lambert
defended the fire department, saying that the blaze was extinguished 
within about 45 minutes and that's when firefighters' involvement ended.

The
accident has thrown a spotlight on MMA's safety record: over the past 
decade, the company has consistently recorded a much higher accident 
rate than the national average in the U.S., according to data from the 
Federal Railroad Administration.

Last
year, for instance, the railroad had 36.1 accidents per million miles 
traveled by its trains. The national average for 2012 was 14.6.

Before
the Lac-Megantic accident, the company had 34 derailments since 2003, 
according to the federal agency. Over that period, the company was 
involved in five accidents that had reportable damage of more than 
$100,000.

The severity of 
those incidents, however, is difficult to determine from the federal 
agency's 10-year data overviews on railroad safety.

But
before the weekend accident, incidents involving the company's trains 
had resulted in just one death. That 2006 accident involved a vehicle 
that struck a moving train at a highway crossing.

Burkhardt said the figures were misleading.

'This
is the only significant mainline derailment this company has had in the
last 10 years. We've had, like most railroads, a number of smallish 
incidents, usually involving accidents in yard trackage and industry 
trackage,' he told the CBC.

Nonetheless,
Burkhardt predicted the accident would lead to changes in the way 
railways operate, and indicated that MMA would no longer leave loaded 
trains unattended, a practice he said was standard in the industry.

The
tanker cars involved in the crash were the DOT-111 type - a staple of 
the American freight rail fleet whose flaws have been noted as far back 
as a 1991 safety study.

Experts
say the DOT-111's steel shell is so thin that it is prone to puncture 
in an accident, potentially spilling cargo that can catch fire, explode 
or contaminate the environment.
