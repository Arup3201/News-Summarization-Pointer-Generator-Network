Hillary Clinton's presidential popularity has dropped significantly since she launched a media blitz to promote her new book Hard Choices, a poll taken over the weekend shows.

The presumed 2016 presidential candidate still leads her likely Republican challengers by double digits, but her share of the vote dropped under 50 percent in the latest Zogby Analytics poll.

'Some pundits suggest that it is good that former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton is airing her dirty linen and making her campaign 
mistakes now with over two years to go until the 2016 elections, ' pollster John Zogby said in a post on the company's website. 'Others,
 me included, argue that this lackluster performance is not likely to go
 away.'

Zogby's findings echo Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' comments on Sunday morning that voters are getting 'Hillary fatigue.'

Hillary and Bill Clinton have been in the news nearly every day throughout the past month and a half as Hillary geared up for and then launched her second memoir.

Much of the coverage of the former first family has not been favorable, as both heads of the Clinton household have struggled to explain away issues with Hillary health and the massive amount of money they've added to their pocketbooks since departing the White House a decade ago.

Zogby's poll intimates that the Clintons' many appearances throughout the last several months have done more to hurt Hillary Clinton's chances in 2016 should she run for president than it has to help.

In a hypothetical match-up against former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Zogby found that Clinton would win with 47 percent of the vote to Bush's 35 percent, and 12 percent of voters would select 'other'. Only five percent of voters said they weren't sure who they would pick.

While Clinton still holds a commanding lead over Bush, support for the former secretary of state has dropped four points in the last month. In May she led him 49 -32.

Likewise, Clinton would only beat Kentucky Senator Rand Paul by 12 points, down from 21 points in March and 17 points in May.

She holds the most significant lead over embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whom she would beat by 15 points. Even her edge over Christie, who has suffered through his own share of problems in the last year, has declined since March, dropping from 26 points in March to 16 points in May.

Zogby did not ask or would not say how Clinton would fare against other rumored 2016 candidates.

The latest Zogby Analytics poll is consistent with the outcome of a recent Ramussen Reports survey that found that found Clinton would beat potential general election opponents by 11-14 points.

Only Paul came within striking distance of the Democratic front-runner, and the right-leaning polling group found Clinton would still win with seven points to spare.

That poll tested Clinton against Texas Governor Rick Perry, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, in addition to Paul and Christie. It did not ask respondents about Jeb Bush.

On Sunday, Republican Party head Reince Priebus postulated that Americans are already growing tired of the Clinton 'show' two and a half years out from the presidential election.

'There’s Hillary fatigue out there. It’s setting in,' Priebus said on Meet the Press.

'And I just happen to believe that this early run 
for the White House is going to come back and bite them. And it already 
is. People are tired of it,' he said.

The reason Americans are not as sick of Bush, despite being part of the Bush political dynasty, is because he and his family aren't in the public eye as often as Bill and Hillary, Priebus told Meet the Press host David Gregory.

'I don’t think Jeb and the Bushes are being as obnoxious,' the Republican leader said.

In hypothetical match-ups against other prospective 2016 presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton would beat Republican contenders, but by an increasing smaller margin
