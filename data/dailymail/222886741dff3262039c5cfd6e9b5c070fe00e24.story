When Arsene Wenger turned down the opportunity to sign former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas for £30m, many Gunners fans thought their boss had lost it.

Having seen transfer window after transfer window with little impact until late August, it’s hard to blame them.

But as Arsenal close in on Alexis Sanchez for the exact same fee, Wenger’s decision has been vindicated.

The Barcelona forward is expected to seal his switch to north London as soon as a deal is finalised between Barca and Liverpool for Luis Suarez, with Spanish reports suggesting the lure of the French boss was the main factor for Sanchez.

Wenger is said to have ‘seduced’ (steady on) Sanchez in a private meeting in Brazil, where he has been commentating for French television during the World Cup.

When pictures leaked of the 64-year-old playing football on the beach in Brazil while Manchester United and Chelsea signed the likes of Luke Shaw and Diego Costa, social media went into overdrive.

Was this going to be another summer where transfer targets come and go? Would Abou Diaby again be classed as a new signing? Not this time. There was a plan.

Even in the imminent arrival of Mathieu Debuchy Arsenal are bringing in a proven replacement for Bacary Sagna, but it is that star striker that fans crave.

The £40million plus £1 bid for Suarez last year signalled Wenger’s intent to sign a leading goalscorer to partner or play around Olivier Giroud. And in Sanchez, Arsenal may well be getting the next best thing.

The Chilean operates up front for his country in a 3-5-2 formation, snapping at the heels of defenders, not giving them a moment's rest.

Acting as the focal point of their attack, Sanchez also drops back to start moves and create for his team-mates; similar to the role Lionel Messi takes up at Barcelona.

Sanchez was told by Udinese team-mates before his move to La Liga that the Premier League suited his style more, but his time in Spain can only be classed as a success. Thirty-nine goals from 83 appearances in the league during his three-year stay is one thing, but it is his unselfish movement - either as a No 9 or winger - that helped Messi to flourish.

Giroud, Theo Walcott and possibly Loic Remy may not be who Sanchez is used to playing around, but he has proved before he can do it on his own.

If he can combine the qualities he has shown with Chile and Barcelona, there’s no limit for the 25-year-old in England. And you can thank Wenger for his arrival.
