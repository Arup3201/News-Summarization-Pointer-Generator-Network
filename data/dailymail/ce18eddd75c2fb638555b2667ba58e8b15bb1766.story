AUGUSTUS: FROM REVOLUTIONARY TO EMPEROR By Adrian Goldsworthy (Weidenfeld & Nicolson £25)

The Roman emperor Augustus surely has a good claim to be considered the greatest leader in history. At 18, he made himself undisputed ruler of Rome and the most powerful man on Earth, governing an empire that was not only mostly peaceful, but prosperous under him.

Not bad for a sickly teenager, whose eyes were described as being as widely spaced a horse’s, and whose limbs were marked by scaly skin.

His rise to power followed years of bloody civil war. Not everyone supported Augustus’s rule, but most agreed it was preferable to continuing slaughter. Grateful Romans hailed him as the son of a god and father of his country.

In private, as ancient historians such as Suetonius record, they identified more pungent qualities, among them his taste for married women and a vicious temper. Goldsworthy’s preferred description of Augustus is ‘warlord’.

Ambition, political acumen, sleight of hand and plenty of good fortune smoothed Augustus’s path to supremacy. For almost six decades he dominated the violent world of Roman politics.

Underpinning everything was military support on an unprecedented scale. Despite a dodgy track record on the battlefield — he had a knack of falling ill and missing the worst of the fighting — Augustus was a military dictator. He worked hard to keep Rome’s armies on his side.

Augustus was as slippery as any politician. He devised an approach to government that was transformed into a one-man tyranny by his successors, including the lunatic Caligula.

Under Augustus’s heirs, the Empire had all the trappings of monarchy, despite Augustus claiming that he had restored the Republic, a system intended to prevent excessive power on the part of any individual.

Goldsworthy’s is not a radical reinterpretation of Augustus. He presents a man who, in his youth, was ruthless, cruel and occasionally vindictive. With age came mellowness and, for much of the time, a velvet glove disguising the iron fist.

For good measure, he commissioned splendid buildings, restored temples, improved the road system and struggled to clean up elections.

He also did his best to improve Rome’s morals, despite the many affairs that punctuated his 50-year marriage to Livia, whom he stole from a fellow senator. He even banished his own daughter and granddaughter on charges of adultery.

Goldsworthy’s aim is to examine the Roman emperor as if he were the subject of a modern political biography. He mostly succeeds.

At times, Augustus disappears from view, victim of the author’s relish for the details of warfare. After 2,000 years, and with patchy source material, it is impossible to identify Augustus’s motives clearly, beyond concluding that he was spectacularly determined and a workaholic.

Goldsworthy’s mastery of his material is assured. He is undoubtedly correct to demolish many of the more colourful rumours reported by ancient historians. Suetonius, for example, claimed that Augustus tore out a rival’s eyes with his own hands on a misplaced suspicion that the man intended to stab him, and that he once offered to have sex with an older politician in return for 3,000 gold pieces. As a result, Goldsworthy’s Augustus is a more elusive, less likeable character.
