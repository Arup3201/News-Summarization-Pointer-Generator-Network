Like twerking, Robin Thicke and the horse-meat scandal, glamping is so last year.

Seriously. Look around you. You can barely move for luxury ‘camp’-sites where the ‘tents’ – if this is still the word – look and feel like a boudoir in the Palace of Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV.

Lovely. Comfortable. But scarcely the ‘Great Outdoors’.

Meet the locals: Matt gets up close and personal with two new canine friends on his visit to Swedish Lapland

Onwards, into the snowy middle distance: Swedish Lapland is a great place to try a session of dog-sledding

On the other hand, the ‘Great Outdoors’ comes with its downsides.

For every dew-tipped sunrise, there is a tent collapse that leaves you howling in the dark, or a squirrel dive-bomb attack which has you cowering in a corner.

So what do you do if you want a bit of both – a few creature comforts, but also a sense that you are away on a grand adventure?

Fredrik Broman, the marvellous mind behind the Aurora Safari Camp, thinks he has the answer.

Authentic but cosy: Matt stayed in a lavvu tent - an Arctic tipi with creature comforts such as a log fire

Having cut his camping boots as a photographer and guide across Africa, he came up with the curveball idea of transplanting a traditional bush camping experience into his native environment of Swedish Lapland.

The camp is situated a short drive from Lulea airport – far enough into the north of Sweden that, on arrival, I am greeted by a soon-to-be common sight: a spectacular, snow-blanketed village of the most idyllic, festive variety.

Throw in suitably Arctic temperatures of -20°C, and the super-smiley faces of the locals who run the camp, and I am certain that I am about to enjoy the not-glamping-but-not-just camping experience I have been seeking.

But first, we have to find the camp – which lurks in a place where no roads go.

Love match: Matt enjoys another moment with man's best friend (left), and admires an ice sculpture (right)

After decking me out in the finest layered snow gear (reindeer pelts come as standard), and warning me to keep an eye out for the area's many moose, reindeer, lynx and - gulp - the occasional bear, I am encouraged to hop aboard a snowmobile.

Soon, we are barrelling along a narrow forest-blanketed snowpath into the night.

As the wind picks up, a few more degrees freeze away, and my face begins to turn numb. Then we break out of the trees and bounce onto a frozen lake lit only by bright starlight and full moon above.

Luckily for me (and the fingertips to which I've grown accustomed), we soon slow to a stop on the bank of a snow-clad island, and I spot the orange lights of the camp twinkling among the dense forestry.

All paws forward: Matt headed out with a husky team - one of the must-do experiences of a trip to Lapland

Sunshine on the frozen plains: There are few more majestic sights in Sweden than a team of dogs in profile

I am shown to my ‘lavvu’ tent - an Arctic tipi complete with log fire, thick sleeping bag and sturdy bed. And a quick tour shows me the rest of the surprisingly eco-friendly camp – an indoor lounge; a mercifully canvas-enveloped flushable toilet; just a few other Lavvu tents, all set to a snooze-inducing 20°C; solar-powered ground lamps to guide you along the paths at night.

Along with the camp’s other new residents, I head out for a short session of staring upwards, hoping to spot the Northern Lights.

Then we retreat to the fire-warmed lounge and while away the night sharing travel stories with the camp's endlessly fascinating guides. As we do so, we munch on dried moose, Arctic char and Swedish cheese, and slurp a combination of warm lingonberry juice and throat-embalming red wine.

A pause for a breather: Matt exchanges travel tales - as the huskies also take time out from their wild efforts

Ice ice baby: Matt has his own attempt at creating an frosty sculpture - a little more practice required, possibly

I trudge back to my tent and take a moment to soak up the serene surroundings and the unbeatable, incomparable silence.

It is easy to see why rumour has positioned the camp as a magnet for world-famous celebrities. One local whisper has even mentioned Angelina and Brad – no doubt in search of the same things as us mere mortals. If you are looking for unpretentious, soul-soothing isolation, it does not get much better.

One undeniably unusual sleep later (a small note of warning – the fire in your lavvu has to be tended, by hand, with pre-cut logs every two hours – otherwise, well, you will freeze), I wake to the sound of mushing, and the arrival of 'The Dog Whisperer'.

Sixteen perfectly trained pure-bred Siberian huskies are at the camp's disposable – all of them friendly, approachable and happy-to-meet-you hounds.

This will explain why, an hour later, I find myself spread-eagled on the icy surface of another frozen lake, having been comically clattered to the floor while attempting to fend off their affections.

Let's see what's below the surface: An afternoon of endeavour carving out ice blocks with traditional tools

Looking up, seeing the lights: A stay at Aurora Safari Camp also means chances to see the Northern Lights

After dusting myself off and returning to camp, I am encouraged to spend the day's last few hours of sunlight carving ice blocks out of the lake using the time-honoured tools of saws and manual corkscrews.

As the sun sets in the only way Lapland knows how – retina-dazzling shades of oranges and pinks, kaleidoscopically reflected by the ice and snow – and a few more logs are flung on the fire, I decide that, maybe, I am a camper after all.

Taber Holidays (01274 875 199; www.taberhols.co.uk) offers an ‘Aurora Safari Camp And Sami Adventure’ in Swedish Lapland, from £1,975 per person.
