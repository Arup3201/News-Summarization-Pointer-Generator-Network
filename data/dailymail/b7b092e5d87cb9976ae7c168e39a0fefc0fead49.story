It looks like the aftermath of a tropical storm, but this scene of destruction took place on a farm in Worcestershire yesterday.

A tornado uprooted trees and tore the roof of a stable as it swept past the village of Inkberrow in the mid-afternoon.

Amazingly, the fierce winds threw the stable roof 20metres through the air before it came to rest stuck in the branches of a nearby tree.

Other trees were left broken in half at the Knowle Fields Barn Farm complex.

Incredibly, the storm passed over 
workers in a nearby office building, who didn't realise the extent of 
the damage until they stepped outside after it had finished.

Dawn Wheatcroft, office manager at 
partitioning company Waterson's Projects, which is based on the site, 
said that the storm seemed to 'last forever'.

She said: 'It seemed like forever whilst it was happening, although it probably lasted less than a minute.

'It was a bit of a grey day but you never expect something like that to happen, it was one of the worst storms I've ever seen.'

caused road closures in Southampton yesterday

Weather experts believe the tornado may have been a funnel cloud, which can still cause destruction if it touches the ground.

Tornado sightings were also reported in nearby Redditch at the same time.

If not a washout, Bonfire Night looks
set to be something of a damp squid as floods and torrential rain from 
last night give way to light rain mainly confined to Lincolnshire, East 
Anglia and South-East England.

Across remaining parts of the UK it will be a dry night with mostly clear skies.

Cold across Scotland and Northern 
Ireland with a widespread ground frost and an air frost in places. Mist 
and fog patches will develop too across parts of the north where winds 
are light.

Washout: Floods and heavy rain may turn Bonfire Night parties being held over the weekend into wet events forecasters have warned
