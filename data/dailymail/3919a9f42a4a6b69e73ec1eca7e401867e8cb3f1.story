Do you regularly have more than six drinks in one sitting?

Or do you regret a drunken escapade that took place in the past year?

If you have answered yes to either question, you may have a drink problem, according to research.

A paper published by Leicester University advises that GPs should change the way they approach the subject of drinking in routine appointments

A paper published by Leicester University today advises that GPs change the way they approach drinking in routine appointments.

The study found that a positive answer to either of these two questions can correctly identify those with alcohol problems in 87 per cent of cases.

Although these are not strong enough results to immediately diagnose someone as an alcoholic, it is enough to effectively rule out those with no drink problem.

And those who do pose a concern should be referred on for further questioning which can establish a more accurate picture.

If the research, published today in the British Journal of General Practice, is taken on board it could spell an end to GPs asking how many units someone drinks a week.

According to the research, GPs should instead ask, ‘Do you drink six or more drinks on one occasion once a month or more frequently?’

And follow it up with: ‘As a result of your drinking, did anything happen in the last year that you wish didn’t happen?’

If a patient answers positively to either question, a second set of four more detailed questions should be asked.

The research team believe the findings could make it easier for GPs to identify drinking problems which would otherwise remain hidden.

Patients’ answers could either rule out alcohol issues, or could bring to light potentially excessive or unsafe drinking habits.

Dr Alex Mitchell, whose team analysed 17 previous alcohol studies involving 5,646 patients, said: ‘There is great time pressure in primary care.

‘GPs don’t have the time to ask a long list of questions for every single patient. The shorter the survey, the more acceptable it is for GP – but the greater the danger that it is inaccurate.

‘Our work shows that asking just two questions to patients works modestly well, but they need to be followed up by a longer questionnaire of four questions in those who initially screen positive.’

The researchers found that asking two questions could correctly identify those with alcohol problems in 87.2 per cent of cases, and correctly identify those who did not have alcohol problems in 79.8 per cent of cases.

Dr Mitchell added: ‘At the moment, GPs ask patients about alcohol problems during about 3 per cent of consultations.

‘Routine screening using simple questions are an attempt to improve the situation.’
