Found: Convicted killer Phillip Westwater, 44, who went missing from St Nicholas Hospital in Newcastle has been found by police and returned to the hospital

Blundering police allowed a convicted killer, dubbed the 'Black Dog Strangler' to remain at large for 12 hours after he escaped a secure mental institution and spent the afternoon drinking in a gay bar, before finally being reported by members of the public.

Phillip Westwater, 44, was 
detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act after paralysing a gay man
during a pub fight in 1989.

A year later he killed a gay man who was a fellow inmate at Liverpool’s Ashworth 
Hospital with his dressing gown cord, later claiming he was convinced his victim had turned him 
into a black dog.

But on Januray 1, this year, he left his clothes in a pile at St Nicholas Hospital, Newcastle, after asking to use the toilet during an escorted visit before disappearing.

Incredibly it took three hours after the initial report of his escape for officers to change his status to 'unlawfully at large' and still no photograph was released until about 10 hours after he had fled.

An inquiry into the botched hunt for the twice-married Westwater, found officers had failed to adequately assess the risk he 
posed to the public.

Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner, Vera Baird, has published the findings of her investigation into the police’s response to Westwater’s escape, that happened on January 2 this year.

In it she says the police were 'lulled away from recognising Westwater’s status as an escapee' as they often receive reports of voluntary patients going missing.

The reports says that it took three hours after the initial report for the police to change his status to 'unlawfully at large' but even then no risk assessment was done and no photograph was released until about 10 hours after he had fled.

'Mr Westwater was recognised by a member of the public less than two hours after a photograph was issued and was arrested with no difficulty,' the report says.

'It is of note that he, the killer of one gay man and who had slashed another’s throat in licensed premises, was found drinking in company, in a renowned gay bar.

'It seems likely that had the police 
not been lulled away from recognising Westwater’s status as an escapee, a
timely risk assessment would have led to circulation of fuller 
information including a photograph and perhaps to his earlier 
recapture.'

But Ms Baird concludes the report by reassuring the public that the force has been in the process of correcting their failings.

'My principal concern is to reassure 
the public that insofar as any aspect of the Northumbria Police role in 
this event fell short of what the public would expect, it has either 
been or is in the process of correction, principally through the force’s
own internal efforts,' she said.

This has included staff being trained
in risk assessment and to understand the difference between voluntary 
psychiatric patients and those committed by the courts.

Performer: Drag artist Penny Arcade was on stage at the time Westwater was arrested

Staff at The 
Bank said Westwater could have spent all afternoon in the bar, adding 
that he did not seem to stand out despite being 'a bit vacant'.

Penny
Arcade, the drag artist who was performing at the time, described the 
moment the killer was taken away by police: 'He had been in there all 
night - he was chatting to one of the regulars who was buying him 
drinks.

'He was just sat drinking a pint, nothing unusual, which was why it was so unexpected.

'Ten or 12 policemen came in and went up to the smoking terrace. There was no scuffle, he was just led away.

'It
was all over within about five minutes. As they took him out of the bar
he came right past the DJ booth, but he didn't have much of an 
expression - he just looked as if he had resigned himself to the fact he
was going to be taken back.'

'One
of the group he was with saw the picture the police had put out on 
Facebook and recognised his tattoos,' Penny added. 'He called the 
police.

'There was 
quite a crowd outside because people had seen the police vans and there 
was a buzz for a while, everyone was talking about it.'

A manager of the company which owns The Bank said Westwater could have been caught earlier if the photograph had been available.

'Although he looked a little different, his distinctive tattoos gave him away,' Cris Howe said.

'He had been drinking in the bar most of the day, but as his photo wasn't released till late at night no one knew who they were looking for. I can't believe that it wasn't put out more quickly.'

Officers
said they had concerns for Westwater's welfare as he is diabetic. He 
has a pump fitted and police said he has enough insulin to last three 
days.

He has previously been detained at high security psychiatric hospital Broadmoor, joining high profile detainees such as Ian Brady.

Westwater has also been detained at Rampton Secure Hospital, Nottinghamshire.

His life in detention has not
been without incident. He married fellow patient Susan Scott at high 
security hospital Broadmoor but they divorced in 2000.

Westwater
then began a secret romance with a nursing assistant Claire Dudley who 
worked on his ward at Rampton high security hospital in Nottinghamshire.

The pair reportedly wed at a social club in the hospital in November 2008.

Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said the right to marry was enshrined in the 1988 Human Rights Act.

A hospital spokeswoman denied the couple was allowed to consummate their marriage while he was being treated there.
