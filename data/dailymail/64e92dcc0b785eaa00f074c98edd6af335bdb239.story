A group of British squaddies in home-made speedos have created their own version of hit tune 'I'm Sexy and I Know It' from their camp in Afghanistan.

The funny video, which has had 1,895 hits on YouTube since it was posted on Saturday, is entitled 'I'm Squaddie and I know it' and features soldiers re-creating the hit music video.

The video is believed to feature members of B Squadron of the Kings Royal Hussars lip-synching to LMFAO's hit tune, 'Sexy and I Know It,' whilst painstakingly recreating each scene from the music video and using home-made props.

Costume: The squaddies are wearing camouflage shorts, but even these are ripped off midway through to reveal home-made camouflage 'speedo' trunks and testicular guard cup protectors

Dance in their pants: LMFAO's hit video in which they dance in their underwear was the inspiration for the squad ides parody

One squaddie is dressed as lead singer Redfoo in a curly wig and paper shutter shades while another wore a hand-crafted robot head.

The soldiers wiggle their way through the dance routine topless in the desert heat, wearing camouflage shorts, but even these are ripped off midway through to reveal home-made camouflage 'speedo' trunks and testicular guard cup protectors.
