Rich: Top U.S. financier Robert Agostinelli was the subject of a blag by Steve Whittamore, a private detective working for News International

A private detective working for Rupert Murdoch's newspapers used a legally questionable tactic to blag a hotel bill run up by a top New York financier at one of London's swankiest hotels, records show.

Private investigator Steve Whittamore, or someone working for him, tricked Claridge's in Mayfair, central London, to get a copy of a bill belonging to Robert Agostinelli.

The Whittamore database entry on Mr Agostinelli is one of the few pieces of evidence to surface so far that Americans were targeted by operatives working for Murdoch's British newspapers.

Allegations have surfaced that journalists or investigators working for Murdoch may have used similar tactics on celebrities visiting the U.S., but so far those allegations relate to journalists and targets based in Britain.

An FBI investigation so far has turned up no evidence to substantiate allegations that 9/11 victims may have been targeted for intrusion by Murdoch journalists or investigators.

Mr Agnostinelli, a U.S. citizen, runs the Rhone Group private equity firm. He is a former senior partner at Goldman Sachs and Lazard and ranks among the richest financiers in the world.

Whittamore was arrested in March 2003 and subsequently convicted of trading in illegally obtained information, but did was not sentenced to serve jail time. He could not be reached for comment.

The Whittamore database was put together by the Information Commissioner's Office, a government privacy watchdog, from records seized in a police raid on the private detective's office.

The database indicates that Whittamore's inquiry regarding Mr Agostinelli was commissioned by Murdoch's now-defunct Sunday tabloid, the News of the World. The database shows an address for the financier on Fifth Avenue, New York City. It describes Whittamore's assignment as a 'Claridges blag'.

'Blag' is a slang word meaning that a private detective adopts a false identity in order to con information out of a targeted organisation or individual.

In the U.S., blagging is known as 'pretexting'. According to the website of the Federal Trade Commission, pretexting is illegal under federal law if the purpose is to obtain 'customer' or financial information.

In Britain blagging is usually illegal. But newspapers can defend themselves against legal complaints by asserting that the use of the practice in a specific case was in the 'public interest.'

The Whittamore database records show that as a result of the 'Claridges blag', information was obtained about a four-day hotel stay, in a room which cost £411.25 per night. The total bill was £3,433.98. The records show that the hotel stay in question was in the month of July, but do not specify a year.

Searches through media databases do not indicate that stories about Agostinelli appeared in the News of the World in the period before or soon after the police raid during which Whittamore's records were seized.

Some years later, press articles did mention Mr Agostinelli as a member of a group which was interested in buying Liverpool FC, but ultimately lost out to another American bidder.

Blow: Rupert Murdoch appears at the Leveson Inquiry, which is investigating the practices and ethics of the press

Mr Agostinelli appeared as No. 19 in the 2011 edition of an annual 'rich list' published by Murdoch's Sunday Times. The paper said Mr Agostinelli was now 'London-based', with estimated wealth of £625million, and counted former French President Nicholas Sarkozy as a friend.

The journalist named in the Whittamore database as having commissioned the private detective to investigate Mr Agostinelli, who now works for a different newspaper, said he had never heard of the tycoon and maintained that the database entry referring to him was inaccurate.

Mr Agostinelli did not respond to messages left for him at Rhone Group offices in New York and London. A spokesman for Claridges declined to comment.

Murdoch's UK newspaper empire is the principal target of the Leveson Inquiry into the practices and ethics of the British press.

A spokeman for News International said: 'The information ... was the subject of a report by the Information Commissioner's Office in 2006 and has been examined extensively by the Leveson Inquiry in recent months. News International has given detailed evidence on these matters.'

The spokesman added: 'There is a public interest defence available for any potential breach of the Data Protection Act and you do not have the information necessary to make any judgement on specific cases. We are not in a position to comment on a specific case.'
