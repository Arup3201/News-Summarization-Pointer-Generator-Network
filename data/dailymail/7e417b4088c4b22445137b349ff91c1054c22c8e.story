A photographer in Chicago has managed to capture some remarkable footage of a great horned owl swimming.

Yes, swimming.

Steve Spitzer told WGNTV that he was taking pictures at Loyola Park Beach in Rogers Park when he noticed something stirring the water in Lake Michigan.

He was with a birdwatcher at the time, who identified the animal as a great horned owl.

Neither could believe their eyes and Spitzer started filming.

You can swim?: Amazing footage has been captured in  Loyola Park Beach of a great horned owl swimming across Lake Michigan

Remarkable: Chicago area photographer and birder Steve Spitzer captured the most unusual sighting

Graceful: The owl used its huge wings to move in a breast stroke-like fashion

Drying off: The raptor easily made it to shore, where it took some time to rest after the swim

Fluff: The owl can be seen drying off on the shore of Loyola Park Beach

Survivor: Despite appearing a little tired, the owl did seem injured following the attack

Spitzer said the group witnessed the magnificent creature come under attack by two peregrine falcons.

In order to escape the raptor headed for the water and dived right in.

The group called a local bird rescue group, but the owl was long gone by the time they arrived.

While highly unusual, this is not the first time such a bird has been swimming.

Around the same area in 2011, another case was documented.

A bird rescuer, Dawn Keller, was responding to a call at the Chicago Botanic Gardens.

But Keller said once she approached the injured animal, it got scared and hopped into a nearby creek.

She started undressing, preparing to wade into the water to save it, but was shocked to see that it could swim and stay afloat on its own.

'It kept its head above water and seemed to be moving its feet, almost as if it was kicking or paddling.,' Keller wrote in a piece for North America Birding.

'The owl was making a direct path to the opposite shoreline – quite honestly, swimming better than I could have.'

Magnificent: The great horned owl - also called a tiger owl - is the most widely distributed true owl in the Americas
