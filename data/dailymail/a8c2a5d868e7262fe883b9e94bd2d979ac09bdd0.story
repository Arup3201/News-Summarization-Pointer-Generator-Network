Burger King has dropped the price of its chicken nuggets in attempt to challenge the McNugget for the top spot on the pecking order.

McDonald's is currently in the middle of their iconic Monopoly promotion, and game pieces promising free food and the chance to win prizes have driven in nugget-craving customers.

But on Monday, Burger King announced that it was cutting prices on its nuggets, making it possible to get 20 nuggets in its restaurants for 2 dollars less than at McDonald's.

Temptation: Burger King is hoping to use value to draw customers into its stores by dropping their 10-piece to $1.49

'With the growing consumer demand for chicken menu items, we wanted to offer our guests an aggressive deal rivaling anything our competition has ever done,' said Eric Hirschhorn.

Burger King's chief marketing officer for North America's sharp words were reinforced by the chain slashing the price on its 10-piece chicken nuggets down to $1.49.

CNBC reports that customers may be benefiting from lower nugget costs thanks to Vladimir Putin and Russia.

The country announced a ban of imports of U.S. meats, including poultry, after the United States and others imposed sanctions on Russia over the crisis with Ukraine.

'Historically what we see when we have high beef prices, you see a lot more promotion of other proteins, chicken in particular,' said Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant industry analyst at market research firm The NPD Group.

Burger King isn't the only threat to the globe's largest fast food chain.

Golden: McDonald's has been the top nugget for years, in spite of sporadic concerns raised over the content of their McNugget 

Taco Bell released a breakfast menu earlier this year that has been nibbling away at McDonald's hold over the morning meal. In turn, McDonald's has promoted breakfast through free coffee promotions. 

The Consumerist notes that Hungry Jack's, Burger King's brand in Australia, was even fighting McDonald's own Monopoly game by offering to honor game pieces for free food in their store.

With a ticket for a breakfast wrap, for example, Hungry Jack's customers can get the chain's BBQ brekky wrap, with a hash brown added to a beef patty, egg, bacon and cheese wrapped in a tortilla.
