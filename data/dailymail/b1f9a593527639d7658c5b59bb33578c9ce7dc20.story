The latest addition to casino mogul Steve Wynn’s property portfolio is a Bel-Air mansion that was once owned by country music legend Kenny Rogers.

Wynn is spending $65 million to acquire the Liongate Estate, which got its name when Rogers installed two lions at the front gates back in the 1970s.

Since then the property has changed hands several times and in the past three years it has undergone a substantial face-lift which has more than doubled the original size to 24,000 square feet.

Wynn, 72 and his third wife Andrea Hisson can look forward to spreading out in a property which now has 11 bedrooms and 17 bathrooms, three living rooms, a giant ballroom, a 12-seat theater, custom fountains, saltwater swimming pool and a glass elevator that connects the grounds to a tennis court and a sauna.

Other features include two fountains, seven fireplaces, a billiards room and media room, a professional-sized gym, a ballroom, three steam showers and a dry sauna, hot-tub and pool. 

The estate, which takes up an entire block and is hidden from view by a long driveway, will provide the new owners with some of the best views in L.A.

It was last sold in 2010 for just $12.2 million by author and LA socialite Nancy Davis. 

Despite the massive renovations, the current owners have decided to sell after not spending as much time in L.A. as they had previously planned.

According to the home’s website, it also comes furnished and with 'a fully trained staff if so desired.'

It was a once more modest 10,000 square feet back when Rogers - a Leo and an astrology buff - christened it Liongate Estate in the 1970s. 

Wynn, who is legally blind, is credited with spearheading the dramatic resurgence and expansion of the Las Vegas Strip in the 1990s.

He is worth a reported $3.5 billion after his companies refurbished or built some of the most currently widely recognized resorts such as the Golden Nugget, The Mirage, Treasure Island, Bellagio, Wynn, and Encore.

Two years ago, not long after he married 40-something Hisson, he also bought a $70 million New York Penthouse on Central Park South.

The penthouse apartment occupies the 30th and 31st floors of The Ritz-Carlton Hotel and comes in at 10,882 square feet. The stunning apartment used to be the hotel's grand ballroom before turning into a private residence for the billionaire and his new wife.

It has 4-bedrooms, 5 full bathrooms and 5 half bathrooms, a 900-square foot living room, a dining room, a media room, and a library. Each room is thought to have 15-foot ceilings.
