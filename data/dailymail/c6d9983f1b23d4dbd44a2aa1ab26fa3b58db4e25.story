TOWIE star Bobby Cole Norris has today thanked the 3,000 people who have signed the bone marrow donation register after he issued an appeal to help save his mother's life.

Co-stars and a host of reality TV stars rallied behind the star of The Only Way Is Essex, after he revealed his mother and 'best friend', Kym Norris was diagnosed with leukaemia.

Doctors have told the family her best hope is a bone marrow transplant, prompting the 28-year-old to launch his desperate plea.

The charity Anthony Nolan told MailOnline the #SaveBobbysMum appeal has generated 3,000 donor sign-ups in the last week - a 750 per cent increase on the same week last year.

TOWIE star Bobby Cole Norris told MailOnline he has been 'overwhelmed' by a surge in people signing Anthony Nolan's bone marrow donation register after he launched an appeal to find a donor for his mother last week

The 28-year-old tweeted his thanks to people who have already signed up, but urged more to follow suit, revealing they have yet to find a match for his mother Kym Norris, who has been diagnosed with leukaemia

'I'm
 completely overwhelmed by people's kindness,' Bobby told MailOnline.

'Both me and 
my mum were over the moon to hear about these huge increases in 
potential donors - any one of the people who has signed up after hearing
 our story could end up saving a life.

'It’s given us something positive 
to focus on at a really difficult time. But
 we still have a long way to go.

'My mum is one of thousands of people 
who are still waiting for the news that a matching donor has been found.

'It’s a really tough time and we’ve got a long road ahead, but I will be
 supporting Anthony Nolan every step of the way.'

Among those supporting Bobby's campaign, are Geordie Shore's Charlotte Crosby and Vicky Pattison, who tweeted urging fans to sign up.

TOWIE's Jessica Wright and Chloe Sims have also tweeted photographs of themselves with a #SaveBobbysMum sign.

And Katie Price, Mark Wright, Joey Essex, Lauren Goodger, Sam Faiers, Lauren Pope, Anthony Costa and Michelle Heaton, have also called on their fans to act to help save the lives of those waiting for a bone marrow donor.

Ms Norris, 54, pictured with Bobby as a child, went to the doctors a few weeks ago, complaining of feeling lethargic. Tests revealed she had fallen victim to the blood cancer

Bobby, an only child, said he is devastated at his mother's diagnosis. The 54-year-old is currently in hospital and is receiving intensive chemotherapy twice a day to try and treat the disease

TOWIE star Gemma
 Collins said: 'You have been so strong I love you lots #SaveBobbysMum.'

While Bobby’s ex-boyfriend Harry Derbidge wrote: 'Stay strong babe, we are 
all here for you.'

Charlotte Crosby spoke out earlier this year, urging people to sign up.

She said: 'I just thought – "It’s so easy, why doesn’t everyone do this?"

'I was quite shocked that young lads are so underrepresented on the register though.

'I'm completely overwhelmed by people's kindness... But we still have a long way to go'

'Come on lads, just sign up online and spit into a tube! I’m doing it, and I just hope one day I have the chance to save a life.'

Last week Bobby launched his appeal for bone marrow donors to come forward and save the life of his mother, who is fighting blood cancer.

The Anthony Nolan website crashed immediately following his emotional plea on This Morning, and the charity has today revealed that 3,141 people have joined the register online in the past seven days - a 750 per cent increase compared to the same week last year (when just 370 people signed up).

On the day of his This Morning appeal, 817 people signed up – a 2050 per cent increase compared to the same day last year.

Dental receptionist Ms Norris, 54, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia only a few weeks ago, news that turned Bobby’s world ‘upside down’.

Geordie Shore star, Charlotte Crosby has shown her support for Anthony Nolan, calling on her fans to sign the bone marrow donation register

Doctors told Bobby and his family last week that his mother's best hope is a bone marrow transplant to try and treat the disease

Bobby appeared on ITV's This Morning to urge people to sign up to the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register in a bid to help find a donor for his mother

The 27-year-old fashion designer said: 'My mum is my best friend, I'm devastated'

He told MailOnline, said: 'I feel completely helpless right now, but all I can do apart from being there for mum is to try to raise awareness of the Anthony Nolan register, particularly to young people who are much more likely to go onto donate and save a life.

'For the donor, it’s probably just a case of sitting still for a few hours while the stem cells are taken out of their blood.

'But for me, and for families like mine, it’s the difference between having my mum around or not. It’s everything.'

Young donors aged 16 to 30 are urgently needed by the Anthony Nolan charity, which runs the UK bone marrow register.

The charity particularly needs young men to come forward, as they’re the most likely to donate but only make up 14 per cent of the register.

Bobby said: 'Thank you to every single person who has joined the register this week and pledged to save the life of my mum and others in the same position – you are all amazing. 

'We now really need more boys to sign up as they’re so underrepresented on the register – so ladies, please get your boyfriends, brothers and sons on board and together we will save lives.'

Fashion designer Bobby tweeted his appeal for a bone marrow donor for his mother, launching the #SaveBobbysMum hashtag

Ann O’Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan, said: 'What a week it’s been.

'It’s been truly humbling to see the outpouring of support Bobby has had from fans, co-stars, friends and celebrities, who have rallied behind him at this difficult time and told a combined audience of millions about the simple but life-changing act of donating stem cells.

'Stars and fans from all three of these popular shows have joined the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register, including Bobby himself, meaning they could one day save a life from blood cancer. It’s an incredible and selfless example to be setting young people.'

People aged 16 to 30 and in good health can join the Anthony Nolan register here.
