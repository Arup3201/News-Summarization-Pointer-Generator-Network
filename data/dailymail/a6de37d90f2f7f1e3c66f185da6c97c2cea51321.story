The wife of a notorious crime boss has claimed she just 'lives beyond her means' after denying using her husband's hidden wealth to finance their lavish lifestyle.

Actress Ruth Adams told the High Court that she and her husband Terry Adams are so short of money they may have to move in with their parents.

Mrs Adams, who was once in Eastenders and recently appeared in the musical Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be, said she had failed to earn much from her career as a stage actress and from her clothing and interior design business.

However, Kennedy Talbot, prosecuting, said she is hiding the profits made by her husband from when he was a 'career criminal'.

According to Mr Talbot, Mrs Adams has spent thousands since her husband was released from prison in 2010.

They include £12,000 on dental treatment; £2,500 on a weight loss programme; £3,850 on spa membership for her husband; More than £5,300 on parking fees, fines and congestion charge between 2009 and last year; nearly £15,000 on restaurants and holidays including 20 meals at Brown's in Mayfair and a trip for her daughter and husband to China.

Mr Talbot said this amount of spending indicated the couple were not poor and so the court should reject their application to have the outstanding debt from the confiscation order written off.

Mrs Adams has also claimed she has debts of more than £150,000.

She told the court: 'I obviously live above my means. What else can I say?'.

According to Mrs Talbot her acting career had only brought home between £8,000 and £9,000 in recent years.

She also employed her husband as creative designer for her clothes company N1 Angel because she could see that her husband dresses well.

Mr Talbot argued that the company was not a 'legitimate business'.

Yesterday Mr Adams said he felt like 'a ponce' living off his wife's income.

Mr Adams has been described in the courts as once heading one of the most feared organised criminal gangs in the UK.

The 58-year-old owes £628,497 of a confiscation order of £750,000 that was imposed after his conviction at Blackfriars Crown Court in 2007 for conspiring to conceal the proceeds of criminal conduct over a six-year period.

He was also ordered to pay prosecution costs of £50,000 and the £4.6 million bill for his publicly funded defence. A judge said he had accumulated a 'considerable fortune' from his life as 'a highly successful career criminal' over a 'significant' period of time.

Mr Adams is currently seeking a court-approved 'certificate of inadequacy' to show that he does not have sufficient assets to pay back the money sought by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) under the confiscation order.

But the CPS says there is 'a strong case' that he has 'substantial undisclosed assets'.

Mr
 Talbot, representing the CPS, suggested to Mr Adams at London's High 
Court that loans said to have been taken out by his wife because times 
were hard were not genuine.

Cross-examining
 Mr Adams he said: 'These are not genuine loans at all. This is just 
your money being routed to you through fabricated arrangements.'

Denying the accusation, Mr Adams replied that he had said all along, from the time when he was in prison, that he had no money.

Mr
 Adams said to Mr Talbot: 'Now we are here and you are saying we have 
this money I have not got, but how do I prove this to you?'

He
 told Mrs Justice Nicola Davies he was relying on money from his wife, 
adding: 'I feel like a ponce because there is no money coming in.'

Asked
 whether he knew about his wife's interior design business, he said he 
did but she kept it 'all away from me' and she knew 'I get frustrated I 
am not bringing in money. She is the breadwinner, not me, and it is 
difficult for me anyway.'

Claims: He said he is too poor to pay £750,000 as part of a confiscation order and wants to have the debt cleared on grounds of 'poverty'

The
 CPS says Mr and Mrs Adams' average 'identifiable' spending in the three
 years from September 2010-2013 was £97,000 per annum - 'nearly four 
times the national average'.

The
 type of spending was 'inconsistent' with his claim of having no assets 
and of being reliant on friends and family loans for living expenses, Mr
 Talbot has told the court.

Mr
 Talbot argued that the evidence showed a pattern of behaviour that was 
'entirely consistent with the original criminal case against (Mr Adams) 
of concealing his assets through associates and using sham companies to 
provide an apparent form of legitimate income'.

The hearing will continue.
