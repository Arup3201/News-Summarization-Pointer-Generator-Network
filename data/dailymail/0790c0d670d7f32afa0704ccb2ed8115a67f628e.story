She is one of the world's most popular singers, has a four times platinum album, and today added two Ivor Novello gongs to the groaning shelves of her awards cabinet.

But for all her popularity in the music world, it would seem that Adele's popularity does not translate to the fashion industry.

The Vogue cover featuring the British singer proved to be one of the worst sellers of all time, the fashion magazine's editor Alexandra Shulman has revealed.

Top of her game: Adele picked up two gongs at today's Ivor Novello Awards - but that success doesn't translate magazine sales, says Vogue's Alexandra Shulman, as she revealed that the singer's Vogue cover was one of the worst sellers of all time

At a talk in London last night, the Vogue editor admitted that fame doesn't necessarily translate into sales.

'Adele is the most popular woman in the world, but one of the worst sellers we've ever had,' vogue.co.uk reported today.

'I find there has to be a relationship with the person on the cover that goes beyond how they look.'

Music stars haven't sold at all well,' Shulman added at the ToMax talk Fashion and Fantasy: What's in Vogue and Why Does It Matter?.

'Our most successful cover was the millennium issue - which didn't have anyone on it, but acted like a mirror so you could see your own reflection!'

Ms Shulman confessed she has her heart set on one cover girl she believes would send sales soaring - but is having no luck attracting her.

'I'd love to have Kate Middleton on the cover,' she told the audience. 'I assure you it is not for want of asking.'

Unexpected success: Ms Shulman says music stars' covers rarely sell well - and that the best selling cover of all time was the Millenium issue, which instead of a celebrity had a reflective cover, right, so that readers could see themselves as cover star
