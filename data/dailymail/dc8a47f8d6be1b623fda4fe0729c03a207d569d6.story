Mary Kidson, 55, is accused of trying to harm her child by giving her medication that she did not need

A mother poisoned her daughter with a cocktail of drugs for medical conditions which didn't exist, a jury has been told.

Mary Kidson, who runs an online tutoring service for children with special needs, is accused of trying to harm her child by giving her medication that she did not need after becoming convinced that she was ill. 

The mother-of-two gave her daughter the drugs in potentially harmful doses between December 2010 and March 2013, the court heard.

The 55-year-old was arrested in March last year after police searched her £475,000 home in Ledbury, Herefordshire, and found 'a very large amount' of medication.

Her daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given thyroid extract and oestrogen tablets.

Prosecutor John Causer told Worcester Crown Court that Kidson had then gone from 'doctor to doctor' until she found one who 'told her what she wanted to hear'.

Her daughter was also given hydrocortisone tablets after a doctor finally diagnosed deficiency of the adrenal glands.

Ms Kidson continued to administer the tablets even after her daughter had recovered from the condition, Mr Causer said. 

He added that being 'shopped around and saddled with treatment' had harmed her daughter's health and emotional well-being. 

Ms Kidson is accused of three counts of unlawfully and maliciously administering a poison or noxious substance to her daughter, endangering life or inflicting grievous bodily harm. All the offences are alleged to have taken place between 2010 and March 2013. She has denied all charges against her. 

Opening the trial on Monday, Mr Causer said: 'Mrs Kidson is a mother and she is alleged to have attained and administered medication for a condition her daughter no longer had.

'Whether something is noxious depends on circumstances, and evidence in this case comes from medical experts. 

'We will hear evidence tomorrow from a doctor who concludes that the defendant went to more and more doctors until eventually she got the answer she was looking for with treatment and medication.

'He says Mrs Kidson was trying to find a doctor who would give the treatment.

'He will say that the evidence doesn't support that the daughter had deficiency of the adrenal glands.

'Also, thyroid tests for the daughter were normal, and Mrs Kidson appears not to have understood that.

Prosecutor John Causer told Worcester Crown Court, pictured, that Kidson had then gone from 'doctor to doctor' until she found one who 'told her what she wanted to hear'

'The daughter's health and emotional well-being we're harmed by being shopped around and saddled with treatment which was harmful to her.

'Mrs Kidson has taken her daughter from doctor to doctor until she found one who told her what she wanted to hear.'

He said that other evidence will be given, noting that computer evidence and 'a very large amount' of medication was seized in a house search by police in March last year.

Speaking of the risks posed by the medication, Mr Causer said that in the case of the hydrocortisone, Ms Kidson's daughter was given three times the recommended daily dose and that the effects of suddenly stopping taking the drug were 'extremely dangerous'.

He said that the taking of oestrogen could 'result in various undesirable physical developments in the patient', while taking thyroid extract was 'undoubtedly harmful' and could lead to increased bone fractures and heart disease.

Mr Causer said it had taken weeks for the victim's thyroid gland 'to recover from taking thyroid extract she did not need'. 

He also told the jury the matter was 'not an easy case - it's highly emotional', but he urged them to put that to one side as they heard the subsequent days of evidence.

He said: 'We're not saying that Mary Kidson set out to harm her daughter or that she is not a loving mother but the consequences of these actions - even of a loving mother - can be very harmful,'

The trial, which is expected to last between two and three weeks, continues.
