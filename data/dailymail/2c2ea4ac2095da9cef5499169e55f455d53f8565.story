Danny Williams won gold for England at under-73kgs when he defeated New Zealand's Adrian Leat.

The heavily-tattooed 25-year-old was only called up a week before the competition started in Glasgow following injury to Ben Fletcher.

The triumph comes after Williams was out for six months with an elbow injury last year, and is England's eighth gold of the Games so far.

Winner: Danny Williams of England won gold at the Commonwealth Games in the under-73kgs final

Strength: Williams won England's eighth gold medal of the Commonwealth Games on Friday

Champion: England's Williams beat New Zealand's Adrian Leat in the under-73kg final in Glasgow

Williams, a London 2012 Olympian, 
recorded an early Waza-ari score to take control of the contest and 
showed good composure to see out the biggest victory of his career so 
far.

Williams, meanwhile, admitted it had all been an amazing, if testing, experience.

'This feels incredible, the crowd were phenomenal, we could have been in England, everyone seemed to get behind us,' he said.

'I was nowhere near fighting weight and it has been a very hard six days. I dont think people see that part of the sport, because if you dont make the weight you don't fight.

'Most people would have probably cried if they had been the weight I was a week out from fighting.

'My carbohydrate intake was almost zero, I was having one meal of carbs every three days and six tiny little saucepans of food.

'This was drastic because I did not know I was coming, now I just want to have a Guinness.'

There
 was no home nation success in the bronze medal contests as Scotland's 
Patrick Dawson lost out to Australian Jake Bensted, while Northern 
Ireland judoka Eoin Fleming was beaten by Jacques van Zyl.
