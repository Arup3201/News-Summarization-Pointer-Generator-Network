A wealthy businessman and his wife were found dead at their remote home in an Estonian forest after suffering carbon monoxide poisoning, an inquest heard today.

Banker Philip Townsend, 55, and wife Mary Anne, 52, were discovered dead by a plumber on February 24 at the property in Taheva near Koiva Kula, the inquest at Norwich Coroner’s Court was told.

A police investigation was launched and Mrs Townsend’s brother, James Wilson, flew to Estonia to ensure there had been no foul play.

An investigation by a local police chief, Senior Superintendent Ulle Oras, found they were likely to be have been killed by fumes from a petrol-powered electricity generator.

Norfolk coroner William Armstrong recorded a verdict of accidental death.

He said: 'It is very clear that the police investigation found no evidence of any third party involvement or any suspicious circumstances.'

Mr Townsend, who used the title Baron Townsend of Rathmore, had been the research director of Moscow-based investment firm Enza Capital since 2010.

Their main home was a 16th century manor house in Wood Dalling, Norfolk, and they also had a flat in Kensington, London.

The couple, who had two teenage children, had been renovating the barn in Estonia since buying the land in 2009.

The house was in a remote, sparsely populated rural location in the middle of woodland, with no mains electricity.

Local handyman Andres Saretok had been hired to oversee the renovations and had frequently warned Mr Townsend the doors to the generator room should be left open, the inquest heard.

He visited the couple the night before the deaths and repeated the warning.

Police were called after Olev Podenat arrived at the house the next day to fix a burst water pipe.

Mr Townsend was found near the generator with an empty petrol can and Mrs Townsend was found nearby at the bottom of some stairs.

Officers found the doors closed and an exhaust pipe had been disconnected, possibly after somebody tripped on it, Mr Oras’s statement said.

Mr Wilson, a Norfolk farmer, said he had flown to Estonia with another relative five days after the deaths.

He told the inquest: 'We went to find out for ourselves what had happened. We were able to establish, as far as we could, that there were no suspicious circumstances.'

A post-mortem carried out in Estonia and verified by the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital found the pair died from asphyxiation caused by vomiting as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning.

Mr Armstrong said: 'Mr Townsend was clearly an intelligent and capable man.

'He had been told on several occasions the doors should be left open, yet it seems they were closed.'
