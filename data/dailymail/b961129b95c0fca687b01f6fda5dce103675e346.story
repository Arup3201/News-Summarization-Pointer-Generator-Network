I’ll be honest with you. It’s an unlikely story. But then again, so was coming back from 3-0 down against AC Milan, with three goals in six minutes and then winning the Champions League on penalties as a result.

One Night In Istanbul is a new British comedy caper film (adapted from the popular stage play) based around Liverpool’s triumphant night in the Ataturk Stadium in 2005. That was an evening of incredible thrills, spills and heightened drama. 

The film doesn’t match up to those exacting standards, it has to be said. But it does have an honest heart beating at the centre of it. And it does do a decent job of tapping into the whirlwind of emotions that being a diehard football fan is all about.

Caught up in the middle of the story are two down-on-their-luck cabbies, Tommy and Gerry, who, by fair means, but mainly foul, contrive to get to Istanbul with their sons for the game. Prolific star of the big and small screen Steven Waddington is Tommy, whose story drives the film along. 

While Paul Barber - to whom we should all remain eternally grateful for bringing the world Denzel - plays his pal. And gets to be the moral compass AND steal the best laughs in the process.

Their journey from Liverpool to Turkey, and back again is fuelled by the likes of a slavering loan shark, a ‘free spirited’ ex wife, Turkish gangsters, stolen artifacts, police raids, and a big bag of money. None of which ever manages to be anything other than what you’ve seen many times before.

But that is just about ok, because director James Marquand pushes the whole thing along at a fair lick, so there is no need to brood too long on the flimsy nature of the characters and events.

However, there is more. And it’s the more that just made the whole film just a bit too untidy for me, at times. 

Because there is also the story of Tommy and his son using the journey to rekindle their fractured relationship - through frequent acoustic guitar-based song! While there’s the mawkish sentimentality of Tommy’s dead dad’s frequent appearances.

And seeing as this is no Hollywood blockbuster, the cast of thousands is probably more like a couple of dozen. So the crowd scenes do feel a little sterile.

Nevertheless, and in spite of these reservations, as I say there is some genuine pluck and spirit at the core of this film. The two leads work very nicely off of each other in particular. 

While Samantha Womack, who plays Tommy’s ex-wife Carmella (with lavish scouse accent attached) gets to share some screen time with a newcomer to the big screen - one Robbie Fowler. Suffice to say, Morgan Freeman can sleep easy when they’re casting for God in future silver screen projects.

One Night In Istanbul may indeed be the tall tale of one particular football club’s night of triumph, and the supporters who celebrated it. But there is plenty going on in this film that speaks to the football fan in all of us. And it does so with if not exactly huge laughs, but then certainly at least a cheeky, knowing wink.
