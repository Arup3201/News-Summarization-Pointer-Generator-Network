A businessman accused of killing his lover's  husband wrote him a  letter to ask if they could share his wife, a court  heard yesterday.

Kenneth Bill, 63, had rekindled a relationship with Carol Hay, his girlfriend of 40 years ago.

He prepared the indecent proposal weeks before he murdered her husband John, it is claimed.

He gave the typed letter to Mrs Hay during one of their secret meetings at a supermarket cafe and asked her to pass it on to her spouse.

In it he confessed that he was seeing Mrs Hay, and went on to ask if Mr Hay would 'let her carry on seeing me occasionally as I am sure this will give her the best of both worlds'.

It concluded: 'I want her to be happy and I am sure you do too, she deserves it don't you think? If you decide that you don't want her to see me again, please don't mention this letter to her, just look after her and keep her safe.'

Giving evidence, Mrs Hay, 62, told the jury: 'He said to give [the letter] to John, saying we were having a relationship and could he share me, with him seeing me a couple of days a week. I said: “Are you having a laugh?” I took it home and shredded it.'

Police recovered the letter file from father-of-three Bill's computer after he was arrested on suspicion of murder.

He allegedly hatched an elaborate plot to kill Mr Hay, 61, after Mrs Hay finally broke off the relationship.

She said her affair with Bill, the owner of a drilling business who split from his own wife five years ago, began last October. They had had a five-year relationship in the Seventies, but it broke down when she met her husband.

However, last October she was reminded of him after speaking to some old friends at a party. She then wrote to Bill, asking if he wanted to meet for a cup of tea.

'He was very affectionate, very complimentary,' Mrs Hay told Bradford Crown Court. 'He told me that he loved me, that he'd never stopped loving me and that we should never have split up.'

Their relationship became 'intimate' 
when Bill invited Mrs Hay to his luxury detached home in Holmfirth, West
Yorkshire.

He even gave her a mobile phone so they could keep in touch 
without being detected.

However,
after Christmas Mrs Hay's marriage showed signs of improving, and, 
despite being flattered by Bill's attention, she repeatedly tried to end
the affair.

Following one such attempt Bill sent her a text message 
saying: 'If I can't have you there are three things I could do: kill 
myself, kill John or tell John all about us.'

Mrs Hay said: 'I tried to break it off a couple of times and he would be persuasive and he would say we could keep it platonic.

'He was intense about everything...
it was becoming more and more uncomfortable.

'I had a feeling he would 
tell John – I was becoming more and more worried.'

When she finally ended things in 
February, the pair appeared to part on good terms – but secretly Bill 
was seething and still believed their romance could work with her 
husband out of the way, the jury heard.

Mr Hay disappeared in March. His body 
has never been found.

Bill allegedly lured the self-employed builder and
former police officer to an industrial unit by posing as a potential 
customer, before pushing him down stairs at the site in Meltham, West 
Yorkshire, and attacking him, and then burning the body.

Robert Smith, QC, prosecuting, said 
Bill drove his victim's van near the Humber Bridge 70 miles away to make
his disappearance look like suicide.

Mrs Hay suspected Bill's involvement 
and told police about their relationship after recognising his voice on 
an answerphone message left for her husband, the court heard.

Bill denies murder. The  trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
