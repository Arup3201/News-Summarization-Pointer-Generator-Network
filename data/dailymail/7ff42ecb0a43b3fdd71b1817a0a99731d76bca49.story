Huge income: Mark Zuckerberg earned $3.3billion last year by selling stock options in Facebook

Mark Zuckerberg earned $3.3billion last year by selling stock options in his social network Facebook.

Despite limiting his salary at the company he founded in a Harvard University dorm room to just $1, Zuckerberg, 29, received a huge tax bill as a result of the stock sale, a new regulatory filing revealed.

The documents, which were filed yesterday, mark the second year in a row that the Facebook CEO has made a large gain on the holding he accumulated in Facebook since starting the company in 2004, after his 2012 stock option earnings totalled $2.3billion.

Zuckerberg has now exhausted his supply of the 60 million stock options he was given as a result of Facebook's public offering in 2012.

He sold 41.35 million shares for $55.05 each in December, primarily to pay his tax bill on the gains.

Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, also donated 18 million Facebook shares to a Silicon Valley nonprofit organisation last December, totalling nearly Â£1billion.

That single donation saw the couple top The Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual list of the most generous Americans.

Even after selling and donating so much Facebook stock, Zuckerberg still owns 426.3 million Facebook shares - which are currently valued at $25.7 billion.

The stock has more than doubled in value in the last year after Zuckerberg fulfilled his promise to sell more advertising space on smartphones and tablet computers.

The majority of people using Facebook now do so using these devices, as opposed to desktop or laptop computers.

As a result of Zuckerberg's changes, Facebook now earns more than half of its advertising revenue through mobile devices - up from 23 per cent the previous year.

In 2013, Zuckerberg asked Facebook to limit his salary to just $1 annually - something that Google co-founder Larry Page and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had also previously done.

Zuckerberg did receive $653,164 compensation from Facebook last year however, with all but $3,000 being spent on private jet travel.

Facebook says Zuckerberg is forced to travel to business meetings on private jets for security reasons.

Even allowing for this expense, the money Zuckerberg took from Facebook's coffers in 2013 plunged by 67 per cent from nearly $2million in 2012.
