Red Bull's rising star Daniel Ricciardo plans to party hard after capturing the second win of his Formula One career in as equally dramatic circumstances as his first.

In Canada in June, Ricciardo was reliant on technical issues to the all-conquering Mercedes duo of Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton for his maiden triumph, ultimately passing the former in the dying laps.

Seven weeks later, and taking advantage of a wet track at the start of the Hungarian Grand Prix, three crashes and two safety cars, the smiling Australian again stood atop the podium.

On fresher tyres at the end, Ricciardo had to hunt down Hamilton and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, claiming both scalps on laps 67 and 68 respectively of a stunning 70-lap race at the Hungaroring.

'This win feels as good as the first,' said Ricciardo, after cementing third place in the drivers' standings behind Rosberg and Hamilton.

'It honestly does compare to Canada. Obviously the first victory is special, but it definitely leaves you wanting more.

'I was just as hungry for this second one, and it feels just as good - I won't say better, but you realise it a bit more so it feels like you can enjoy it a bit more.

'When I crossed the line everything felt a bit more real, so I guess I took in a bit more of this one, so, yeah, it feels awesome.

'I'm definitely going to celebrate and party for a few days, I think, enjoy a bit of time off.'

It also underlined Ricciardo's status as a driver to now be respected as aside from the two wins, he has also been on the podium on three other occasions and is 43 points clear of team-mate Sebastian Vettel.

Paying his dues to Red Bull, Ricciardo added: 'I want to obviously thank the team.

'To have two victories in the first half of the season with them is phenomenal, and I obviously owe a lot of that to them as well, for letting me settle in, establish myself with them.

'They never put too much pressure on me, they let me roll into it as I like, and that's been the best balance for all of us.

'The results are showing and I'll enjoy this one as much as Canada, but I also want to keep on building on what I've done in the first six months.'
