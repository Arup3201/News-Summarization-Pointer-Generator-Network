Anthony Crolla has vowed to come back 'stronger than ever' from injuries sustained in a confrontation with burglars at his home that cost him his WBA world lightweight title bout with Richar Abril of Cuba.

Crolla suffered a fractured skull which was treated with 12 stitches and and a broken ankle that needed a plate and pins inserted after the incident earlier in December.

The 28-year-old, who has since returned home from hospital, tweeted on Sunday that he intends to get back in the ring once he has returned to fitness.

'It'll be a tough road back but I promise that I will be back stronger than ever in 2015. Thanks so much again #blessed.'
