Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho insisted 'there is no racism in football' after apparently rejecting calls for the introduction of the Rooney Rule in the English game.

Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor claims 'there is a hidden racism which holds clubs back' with the appointment of black and ethnic minority managers.

Only two out of 92 clubs in English football's top four divisions employ a black manager after Chris Powell took charge of Huddersfield and Keith Curle joined Carlisle last month - and Taylor this week called for English football to adopt the Rooney Rule.

The Rooney Rule is used in the NFL to ensure ethnic minority candidates are adequately represented in the interview process for head-coaching positions.

When asked if he felt football was doing enough to bring in black managers and whether he believed a quota should be introduced, Mourinho said: 'There is no racism in football.

'If you are good, you are good. If you are good, you get the job.

'If you are good, you prove that you deserve the job.

'Football is not stupid to close the doors to top people.

'If you are top, you are top,' added the Portuguese, speaking at his weekly press conference ahead of Sunday's match with Arsenal.

Mourinho insists that 'if you are good (enough)' to be the manager of a league club 'you (will) get the job'

Keith Curle, a former assistant at QPR, has taken over at Carlisle, one of only two black managers in the 92

Chris Hughton and Paul Ince are two of a very select few non-white managers with top-flight experience
