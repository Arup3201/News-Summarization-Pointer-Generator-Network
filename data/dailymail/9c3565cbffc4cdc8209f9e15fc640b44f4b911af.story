Handyman Joseph Gentz was arrested today, more than a month after he walked into a Detroit police station and admitted to killing marketing executive Jane Bashara.

He was released last month after police claimed they not find enough evidence against him. His release was yet another bizarre twist in the murder mystery of Ms Bashara, who was found dead in January 25 in her Mercedes SUV eight miles from her home.

Gentz, who was ushered into the Macomb County Circuit Court Friday afternoon, was charged with First Degree Murder as well as Conspiracy to Commit murder, and will be held without bond.

Arrested and charged: Joe Gentz, right, stood with his attorney Don Aubrey last month. He was arrested last Friday and charged with the murder of Jane Bashara

Not free anymore: Joseph Gentz was arrested and charged with murder a month after he admitted to 
murdering Jane Bashara. He claimed he was hired as a hitman by Mrs 
Bashara's husband Bob

Gentz was already wearing blue prison
attire at the time of his arraignment Monday afternoon. CBS Detroit’s 
legal analyst speculated that Gentz’s arrest would by no means be the 
last in this case.

‘Conspiracy means by definition, some
other person. I cannot conspire with myself to commit murder. I need 
somebody else. And the big question of the day: Who is that person?’

Ms Bashara’s husband Bob, 54, has 
been in the public eye for his place in the murder, for one because 
police discovered a secret S&M dungeon in one of Mr Bashara’s 
properties, and more significantly because Gentz told officers that Mr 
Barshara requested the hit on his wife.

Mr Bashara, who remains a person of 
interest, maintains his innocence. Last month, he told ABC News 
exclusively: ‘I did nothing wrong. I didn’t commit murder. I didn’t pay 
to have my wife killed. I’m going to see this through to the end. And 
I’m innocent.’

Meanwhile, Gentz remains in jail, and pending a competency evaluation, will appear in court March 16 for a preliminary exam.

Strangled: Jane Bashara was found dead in her Mercedes SUV on January 25 eight miles away from her home. Bob, right, is said to have been having an affair

Property: Bashara was said to have a 'sex dungeon' with whips and chains in the basement of the Hard Luck bar and Lounge

When police first began to investigate Mr Bashara, they uncovered an S&M sex dungeon equipped with whips and chains. Mr Bashara was also preparing to buy a $245,000 home for his longtime mistress, the Detroit Free Press reported.

Police named Mr Bashara the lone 'person of interest' in the case, but he denies he had anything to do with his wife's murder.

Instead, his lawyer David Griem suggested Gentz is mentally handicapped and that his story about being hired by Mr Bashara is not credible.

Mr Griem said Gentz is the sole person responsible for Mrs Bashara's death.

Gentz's release from police custody sparked outrage from Mr Barashara and Mrs Barasha's family.

'It was a shock and I was scared when I learned he had been released,' Mr Bashara's sister Laura Mauer told the Detroit Free Press.

Bashara initially told police about the night his wife died: 'I got home and she wasn’t 
around and I relaxed and figured she was out running an errand,' Mr Bashara told 7 Action News.

'As
9:00 and 9:30 approached, I became much more concerned and I got more 
people involved,' he said. 'I called my kids to see if they had heard 
from her and they hadn’t.

'I
had been calling her cell phone to find out and then as time got on I 
involved the police because I was concerned there might be something 
wrong.'

After friends and relatives told him they had not seen her, Bashara reported her missing.

'Accomplice': Joe Gentz told police he was paid less than $2,000 to murder Jane by her husband

Scene: Police believe Jane was murdered in her affluent home in an upscale suburb before her body was driven to a run-down version of Detroit

Speaking to the Detroit Free Press last week, he said: 'I have no clue. Someone obviously had made their way into her car or attacked her and 
did what they did to her and dropped her, stashed her car somewhere.

'My heart is broken, and I'm very sad. And it's terrible to think what she had to go through
in the last moments of her life.'

Jane Bashara worked as a senior marketing manager at Kema Services, an energy consulting and testing and certification company.

The Detroit News reported that Bob Bashara is president of the Grosse Pointe Rotary Club and was involved in various charities.

'They were just a great couple,' neighbour Alex Jones told ABC 7. 'It's hard on their kids to hear something like that. There’s no doubt in my mind that it was not him.'
