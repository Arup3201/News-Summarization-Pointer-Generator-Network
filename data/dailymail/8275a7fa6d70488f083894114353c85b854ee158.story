Rolf Harris is said to have created a working didgeridoo instrument while serving time in prison

Jailed paedophile Rolf Harris has made his own didgeridoo behind bars, it has been reported.

The 84-year-old is said to have created a working copy of the Aboriginal wind instrument during art classes at his former prison - HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire.

He has since been moved to Stafford prison where he has joined the choir, singing with other inmates during Sunday services, according to the Daily Star Sunday. 

A source told the newspaper: 'Harris is doing everything possible to keep himself occupied.

'He carved the didgeridoo from wood he found in the jail garden and it is really good.

'Harris is a superb craftsman and making the instrument was a form of therapy for him.'

The disgraced entertainer was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison in July after he was convicted of 12 indecent assaults. 

Harris is appealing the convictions, which include an assault on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens and a catalogue of abuse of his daughter's friend over 16 years.

The Sunday newspaper also reports that the pensioner worked in the farm and gardens unit where he worked as a gardener for £9.60 a week - and in his spare time would make sculptures from fallen wood.

It reportedly took a month for him to create the didgeridoo, which is about 3ft long and has been decorated on the outside with figures and images.

The artist, who famously painted a portrait of the Queen, also created a sculpture of interlocked chains out of wood to 'represent his time in jail'.

He has applied to have the instrument and sculpture transferred to his new cell on the vulnerable sex offenders wing at HMP Stafford but is is thought guards have refused on the basis that inmates are not allowed to have large personal items.

His decision to join the choir came as a shock to many after he previously shunned religion in his autobiography.

In his book 'Can you Tell What It Is Yet?', he claims to have 'basically humanist principles'. 

Harris was spat at and reportedly handed out signed drawings for free to inmates while at Bullingdon, and prison officers are said to be keeping a close eye on him to ensure he is not targeted.

The Ministry of Justice denied Harris had made the Aboriginal instrument but a source confirmed to the Sunday newspaper that they had seen the didgeridoo.
