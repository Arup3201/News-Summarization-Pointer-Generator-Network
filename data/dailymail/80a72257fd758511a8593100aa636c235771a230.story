Suspended: Dr Adam Osborne (pictured) was suspended by the GMC two weeks ago amid sex with patient allegations, and has now stepped down as director of the company he owns with his wife

The psychiatrist brother of Chancellor George Osborne has resigned from his private medical company, leaving it with assets of just £551.

Dr Adam Osborne, 38, was suspended by the General Medical Council two weeks ago pending an investigation into allegations he had a two-year sexual affair with a vulnerable woman patient – a married mother of two with psychiatric issues.

Now he has stepped down as a director of Elitemed, the private company he co-owns with his wife Rahala Noor, a plastic surgeon.

The company recently filed accounts which showed it was worth just £551, had £71 in the bank and owed creditors £7,337. 

Documents also revealed Rahala Noor, 37, who was previously secretary of the company, took over as the sole director.

The couple each own 50 per cent of the company, but GMC rules mean Osborne cannot practise as a doctor until an investigation into the allegations is concluded.

If they are upheld he could be struck off, although the GMC says the current suspension is not an indication of guilt.

Another firm called Devonport Psychiatry, which was registered to Osborne’s West London home, appears to have had its 0845 number disconnected since The Mail on Sunday revealed he had been suspended by the GMC.

He has also taken down his personal website.

Elitemed was set up in 2010 shortly after Osborne was suspended over earlier claims which centred on his relationship with a cocaine-addicted prostitute.

At the time, the GMC said his ‘relationship’ with the woman had ‘clouded his judgment’ and led him to prescribe anti-psychotic drugs, dishonestly use a false name and fail to inform her GP.

The doctor was also disciplined for prescribing contraceptive pills to Rahala – who was then his girlfriend – and an anti-smoking drug to a family member. Osborne married Noor in a Muslim ceremony in 2009 after he had converted to Islam and changed his first name to Mohammed.

A news report about his conversion was last year hidden by Google after a request from an unknown person following a controversial ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling in the European Court of Justice. This gave people the right to have ‘no longer relevant’ items removed from internet searches.

Probe: George Osborne's brother cannot practise as a doctor until the investigation is concluded

Osborne is the youngest brother of the Chancellor and one of four sons born to Sir Peter Osborne – who co-founded wallpaper company Osborne & Little.

After studying medicine at Manchester University, he became a junior doctor at the city’s Wythenshawe Hospital, a job he was forced to quit after the allegations of handing out falsified prescriptions. He went on to practise as a private psychiatrist in Marylebone, Central London.
