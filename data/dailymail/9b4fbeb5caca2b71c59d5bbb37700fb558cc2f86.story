Reform: Police Minister Damian Green will announce reforms for fast-track justice in cases for driving and shoplifting offences

Criminals are waiting so long to go to court because of ‘shocking’ delays in the justice system that they commit more crimes, the Police Minister will warn today.

Damian Green will announce reforms for fast-track justice in cases for driving and shoplifting offences, which are usually tried in a magistrates’ court.

He said the chronic inefficiencies in the justice system – with 44 per cent of criminal cases failing to go ahead on the scheduled day – would provoke a ‘national outcry’ in any other sector such as health.

Mr Green puts ‘unforgivable’ delays in the system down to a ‘blame culture’ in which police, courts and the Crown Prosecution Service failed to take responsibility.

‘Nobody involved in the system finds it shocking, because that’s just the way it is.

‘Actually, with a completely fresh pair of eyes, this is shocking, this is not acceptable. Delay cause extra crime.’

Mr Green said drug addicts caught shoplifting to fees their habit receive no treatment while awaiting trial for up to six months, and may commit further crimes.

'The faster you can get it through, the more likely you are to have gone through the system, be put on probation and these days hopefully to be put on a drug rehabilitation programme which will stop you needing to shoplift in the first place', he said.

'That's a direct link between a more efficient system and a system that actually helps cut crime.'

The failings in justice justice system today reminded him of those described by Charles Dickens in his novel Bleak House, he told the Daily Telegraph.

'The world has moved on and got indescribably faster since the mid-19th century but some parts of the criminal justice system are not keeping pace,' he said.

Mr Green is expected to call for longer hours of operation for magistrates’ courts to get through a backlog of cases, as occurred during the criminal cases that followed the London riots in 2011.

However campaign groups have said this is not the best way to reform inefficiencies in the system, as some delays are down to waiting for the police to investigate cases.

Mr Green said a new criminal justice board would be set up to get senior judges, the police, prosecutors and the courts talking to one another. He added that getting cases to court more quickly would encourage witnesses to come forward.

Javed Khan, of Victim Support, said victims would welcome moves to 'reduce needless bureaucracy and time wasting' across the system.
