During the probe into Dawson's enterprises a
female victim alleged that the octogenarian had offered to perform sex 
acts in lieu of payment for a loan.

The woman was in debt to Dawson, according to reports.

It is alleged that the accused had grabbed the victim and had kissed her neck without consent.

According to police they received a complaint about the pensioner's unusual repayment scheme and launched the investigation.

Dawson faces two charges of aggravated misdemeanor charges, one of prostitution and one of intent to commit sexual abuse.

He was released from the Appanoose County Jail after he posted a bail bond of $2,000.

The grey-haired would-be councillor is currently running for public office in Centerville City Council.
