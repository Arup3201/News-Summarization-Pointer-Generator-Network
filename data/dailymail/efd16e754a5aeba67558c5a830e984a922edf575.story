Motorists testified at Kerry Kennedy's drugged-driving trial on Monday that she swerved her Lexus into a truck, damaging the car and blowing a tire, but kept driving and later was slumped at her steering wheel and disoriented.

Her lawyer said she was 'sleep-driving' because she had accidentally taken a sleeping pill.

Kennedy, 54, ex-wife of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, daughter of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and niece of President John F. Kennedy, went on trial today in White Plains, suburban New York.

Family: Kerry, 54, is charged with one count of driving while impaired, a misdemeanor. She was supported by her mother Ethel Kennedy, who exited the court in a wheelchair

She was supported by 85-year-old mother, who came to court, and brother Robert F Kennedy Jr. who defended his troubled sister before the trial began.

In his opening statement, defense lawyer Gerald Lefcourt told the six jurors that Kennedy was not disputing that she drove erratically.

But he said it happened because Kennedy accidentally took a sleeping pill that morning instead of her thyroid medication.

Kennedy's blood tests revealed a small amount of the sleeping drug zolpidem. 'The zolpidem kicks in. It shuts her down. She's in a state of sleep-driving,' Lefcourt said.

Prosecutor Doreen Lloyd said even if the pill were taken accidentally, Kennedy violated the law 'by failing to stop and pull over as she felt the onset of symptoms.'

But Lefcourt said Kennedy never knew what the drug was doing to her. He said the medication 'hijacks your ability to make decisions.'

Kennedy was arrested in 2012 after her car hit a tractor-trailer on an interstate highway near her home outside New York City. She drove to the next exit, where she failed a sobriety test, police said.

Leaving court: Kennedy initially said a partial seizure was to blame but a toxicology report showed that she had sleeping medication in her system

One fellow motorist, Henry Myers of 
North Salem, said he saw Kennedy swerve her car into the tractor-trailer
 on Interstate 684 and keep driving despite damaging her tire.

'I saw smoke. I figured the car would stop,' he said. When it didn't, he called 911.

Another
 driver, William Carlino of Armonk, testified that a few minutes later 
he found Kennedy slumped over the wheel and disoriented, with the car 
running, in a left-turn lane on Route 22.

Carlino
 said her car had one wheel without a tire. He said he ran from his car 
to hers and knocked on her window, which seemed to startle her.

'I asked if she was OK and she nodded in the affirmative,' he testified. He also called police.

Kennedy's
 mother, Ethel Kennedy, was among the supporters at her daughter's 
trial; Robert F. Kennedy's widow, 85, walked slowly with an escort as 
she entered the courthouse.

Two of Kerry Kennedy's brothers, Robert Kennedy Jr. and Douglas Kennedy, also were in the courtroom.

The
 case was being heard in state Supreme Court, a rarity for such a minor 
charge, but Kennedy's lawyers successfully argued that the Town Court in
 Armonk, which had jurisdiction, was too small and poorly equipped for 
the trial.

A town judge and a
 state judge both refused defense efforts to get the charge dismissed, 
despite warm letters from family and friends extolling Kennedy's work in
 human rights around the world.

Kennedy,
 of Bedford, won permission from Justice Robert Neary to miss last 
week's jury selection because she was on a human rights trip to Western 
Sahara. The trial is expected to last about a week.

Robert
 F Kennedy Jr. spoke out in defense of his beleaguered sister before her
 trial began. 'Bobby' Kennedy defended Kerry pointing to the positive 
impact of her human rights activism.

'Kerry's
 been instrumental in freeing political prisoners and dissidents from 
around the globe from imprisonment and torture,' RFK Jr told the New York Post.

JFK's 60-year-old nephew added: 'She 
has freed hundreds of political prisoners from Uganda to Nigeria to 
Kenya and Mexico because she has access because of her name.'

But he did caution: 'That doesn't mean she's above the law.'
