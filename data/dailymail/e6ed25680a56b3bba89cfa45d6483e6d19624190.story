A star student has missed out on a full scholarship to Stanford because a computer glitch meant his high school failed to send his transcripts to the college.

Lincoln To, a 17-year-old who graduated from Serra High School in San Mateo, California with a 4.67 GPA, had been named a finalist for a full QuestBridge scholarship to the university.

But he was stunned when he received a letter saying he had not been considered because his application was incomplete.

'Considering the fact that I was rejected purely because [the school] made a mistake, that made me really upset,' To told San Diego 6, admitting that it was hard to return to class after the error.

'I could be going to the top engineering school on the west coast. I could be having a great time at one of the best schools in the world.'

The high school later confessed to the glitch, admitting that a technical error with a new system had caused a delay in the transcript. 

Staff wrote to the university to explain the situation, saying: 'Because Lincoln trusted our electronic system and it failed, Lincoln lost or missed out… It was out of Lincoln's control and he is a very deserving student of this scholarship.'

The university would still not consider To. He has now started his freshman year at UCLA instead - on a full scholarship.

To and his family were so upset by the glitch that they filed a claim against San Diego County asking for $250,000 - the value of the scholarship - but the claim was denied.

The San Diego Unified School District said they are working to overcome the problems with its student information software and transcript procedures after the system caused issues for several students.

'We have to do what's right by our students, and we made a mistake,' San Diego Unified School District spokesperson Ursula Kroemer told KGTV. 

Administrators wrote a blanket letter in February explaining that the district was having trouble with its system and asked colleges to show San Diego Unified students leniency for missed deadlines.
