Campaigners in the Lake District are fighting plans for a proposed 'eyesore' fence which they say will spoil the national park and ruin its chances of becoming a world heritage site.

Water company United Utilities wants to erect the six-mile fence in open land above Thirlmere, in a bid to keep out sheep from the three-square-mile area. 

They say 'over-grazing' by the sheep has eroded the peat, causing it to wash down the hill and discolour the reservoir water.

But the Open Spaces Society and the Friends of the Lake District are fighting the scheme, saying the fence will be an eyesore on the landscape and will prevent walkers from roaming freely across the fells.

They also fear the barrier could undermine the government's bid to make the Lake District a world heritage site, something which will be considered by Unesco's committee  in June 2017.

Now Miriam O'Reilly has waded into the debate, warning the move could open the floodgates for more development on open land in the national park. 

'It would take away the right of hill farmers to graze their animals there, but would also hinder hill walkers who have enjoyed the landscape for centuries,' she told The Times. 

Miriam O'Reilly, the former Countryfile presenter, has joined campaign groups in opposing the plans

She added that it would not only 'destroy the look of the landscape' but would also 'prevent people from roaming freely'.

The proposal, which is due to be considered by the government's Planning Inspectorate later this year, said the fence would be temporarily erected for 15 years. 

United Utilities said the move is needed to stop peat entering Thirlmere and contaminating the reservoir, which is one of the North West’s most significant sources of public drinking water. 

It also promised that access to walkers would not be hampered and that it would only prevent the free movement of livestock. Gates will be included at regular intervals, the plan says.   

But Ian Brodie, who represents OSS, said the fence was not 'temporary' because it would be in place for 15 years. 

He said: ‘The proposed fence will be one of the greatest threats the Lake District has faced to the traditional openness and freedom of the fells.

'It will impact on many walkers each year and it appears to run contrary to the principles of the bid for World Heritage inscription which United Utilities are supposedly supporting.’

Rory Stewart, MP for Penrith and The Border, has also joined the campaign, saying the fence would jeopordise 'that combination of wild and pastoral that inspired Wordsworth'.

But biodiversity officer John Gorst, from United Utilites, said: 'It absolutely isn't our intention to hamper people's access or enjoyment but what many probably don't realise is that, although beautiful, the Thirlmere valley is not working the way nature intended.

'We're trying to encourage natural vegetation which has been over-grazed for many years to regenerate and hopefully restore habitats like blanket bog, which is natural to the valley.' 

He added: 'Unfortunately without a fence, it’s hard to see how we can help restore the land.'
