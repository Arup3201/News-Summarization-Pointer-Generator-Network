Justo Santos, 44, was arrested after the daughter of the Manhattan restaurateur shot dead in 1986 tracked him down following an online manhunt years later

A man accused of killing a restaurant owner more than 25 years ago has said he was acting in self-defense when he shot him during a scuffle as he feared for his life.

Justo Santos, 44, was arrested after the daughter of the Manhattan restaurateur shot dead in 1986 tracked him down following an online manhunt years later.

Santos was arrested in Miami last year in connection with the killing of José 'George' Martinez.

He was tracked down by Martinez's daughter, actress Joselyn Martinez, who was just nine when her father was killed in front of his wife.

Appearing in court yesterday, Santos said his life has been destroyed, the New York Post has reported.

Santos told the court: 'I was the victim too.'

He said he acted in self-defense after Martinez choked him during a scuffle outside the restaurant.

Asked about why he moved to Miami instead of staying in New York following the shooting, Santos said he 'had no winter clothes' and wanted to go somewhere warm, according to the New York Daily News. 

The hearing was held yesterday to decide whether Santos' constitutional rights had been violated because of the length of time it took for authorities to prosecute him.

On the night of the shooting, Santos, then 16, and two of his companions were thrown out of Mr Martinez’s restaurant, after they allegedly made a rude comment to a waitress.

Santos told the court he shot Martinez in self-defense after he felt his life was in danger when the restaurant owner started choking him.

Days after the incident, Santos flew to the Dominican Republic where he was arrested for the killing.

The court heard Santos chose to face trial in a Dominican court where he was found guilty of manslaughter, jailed for a year and ordered to pay 50,000 pesos to Martinez's mother and brother.

Upon his release from prison, Santos moved to Miami where he started a new life, the New York court heard.

His defense lawyer, Lawrence Herrmann, has argued the authorities allowed too much time to pass before issuing an indictment.

He said the delay has meant it is difficult for Santos to put together a credible defense, The New York Times reported.

The hearing is due to resume with final arguments on September 18. 

At the time of Santos's arrest last year Joselyn Martinez (pictured with her mother at a birthday party) said: 'My mom told me to never forget his name. She’d tell me, "You have to know who did this to your family"'

At the time of his arrest last year, it was reported how Joselyn Martinez kept the wanted posters following the shooting to make sure she would not forget who she was hunting.

She said: 'My mom told me to never forget his name. She’d tell me, "You have to know who did this to your family".'

Ms Martinez started to use social media, she kept an eye out for the man she had been looking for, although his name did not show up on Facebook or MySpace.

Then in 2008, she signed up for a free promotional search on Background.com and Santos' name appeared.

Spurred on by the results, Joselyn paid $70 fees to Background.com and similar sites, including USA-Peopleseach.com, Peoplelookup.com and Intelius.com.

'They all had it. They had his address. They had his phone number,' Ms Martinez said.
