Coronation Street fans could soon be able to say ‘I do’ in the Rovers Return after the old Quay Street set was granted a wedding licence.

The certificate will allow non-religious marriages and civil ceremonies to be performed at the studio, where the ITV soap was filmed for 53 years.

The licence covers Stage One, home to indoor sets including the Rovers Return pub and the Underworld factory.

The area also includes the homes of some of the show’s most famous characters, from Jack and Vera Duckworth’s old house to the Platt family’s residence and Carla Barlow’s flat.

The barge where Ken Barlow’s mistress Martha Fraser lived is also moored there.

Brides and grooms will be able to have their photos taken on the famous Weatherfield cobbles once they have got hitched inside.

The studio opened as a temporary visitor attraction in April after production moved to a new set at MediaCityUK in Salford Quays.

Tours of the set are operated by tourist attractions group Continuum, which applied for the wedding licence last month.

The venue can already be hired out for private events, which give guests access to the whole set, but it has yet to host a wedding reception.

Evening hire is currently only available on weekdays, at a cost of £2,500, with the venue catering for up to 120 people at a sit-down dinner and 250 at a drinks reception.

It has already taken a number of corporate bookings and will hold its first bar mitzvah party next week.

Wedding packages and prices are still being finalised and details are expected to be announced early next week.

Corrie fans who want to tie the knot there will have to make it a shotgun wedding though - the studios are earmarked for redevelopment and are set to close in October.

The wider Granada Studios complex was bought by developers Allied London and Manchester council in a £26.5m deal last year and will ultimately form part of a blueprint for a new city centre neighbourhood.
