Tragic: Choudhry Zishan, pictured, a father of one, was brutally murdered by two brothers as he headed to work in the early hours of the morning

Pictured for the first time, this is the face of father-of-one Choudhry Zishan, the hard-working newsagent who was brutally murdered by two brothers as he headed to work in the early hours of the morning.

The release of Mr Zishan's photograph today comes as the men convicted of his murder, Jonathan McKinley, 23, and Samuel McKinley, 25, were jailed for life.

The McKinleys will both serve at least 28 years behind bars before being eligible for parole over the killing of the 35-year-old in March, a court official confirmed.

Mr Zishan, 35, had left his pregnant wife, Sabina, and five-year-old son in bed as he left his flat to work at one of his stores in Southampton, Hampshire.

But as he walked towards his car at about 4.30am, he encountered the McKinley brothers who were 'spoiling for a fight', jurors heard.

The drunken thugs launched the attack on Mr Zishan and demanded his money before savagely beating him, ramming his head into a parked car. 

Prosecutors told the trial that what began as a robbery turned into 'gratuitous violence' by the brothers against father-of-one Mr Zishan in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

Winchester Crown Court heard that the McKinley brothers had spent much of the previous evening drinking in the Litten Tree pub.

CCTV footage shown to the jury captured the moment the McKinleys met their victim at a pedestrian crossing, and further footage showed some of the attack in the distance.

Prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC told the trial Jonathan McKinley put his arm around Mr Zishan and began to talk to him before they started to follow him as he walked away down the High Street.

It became clear that Mr Zishan wanted nothing to do with the brothers, Mr Langdon said, before the pair embarked on a 'bewildering' and 'deeply shocking' attack.

This week, Jonathan McKinley, of Chandler's Ford, and Samuel McKinley, of no fixed address, were both convicted of his murder.

Following the brothers' convictions, relatives of Mr Zishan paid tribute, describing him as someone who 'wouldn't hurt a fly'. 

His family said the McKinleys deserved to spend the rest of their lives behind bars to protect others.

Mr Zishan's younger brother, Ali Fayyaz, 32, said: 'He looked after everyone, his whole family.

'He was very hard-working and was always thinking of the future. He never really cared about money. He respected the elderly and youngsters.'

Mr Zishan's older sister, Tayyaba Iqbal, said: 'He was my best friend. There are four sisters and two brothers. He was everything to me. He was close to my heart.'

'He wouldn't hurt a fly. I just wish he had been able to save himself.' She said the family was still reeling from his death.

Caught on camera: A police video revealed yesterday shows the moment two brothers who brutally murdered Mr Zishan were arrested, with one asking police officers: 'I've been arrested for murder? This is a joke'

Protest: During Samuel McKinley's (pictured) arrest, he said: 'Can I explain what happened here or not? I just don't know what I'm arrested for'. The attack on Mr Vishal was described as 'senseless' and 'brutal'

She added: 'We cannot even think of doing anything without him, especially my mother.'

The family said they found it hard to put into words their thoughts on the McKinleys.

Mr Fayyaz said: 'They should spend their whole life in prison. At least then other people will be safe.'

Zafar Iqbal, his brother-in-law, said: 'He was a saint. He was even looking after an elderly neighbour. He was a great gentleman.'

Crime scene: Mr Zishan, who had a five-year-old son and a baby on the way with his pregnant wife, could not be saved and died from extensive brain injuries after the attack in Eastleigh

Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, of Hampshire Constabulary, said: 'It was a senseless, brutal and sustained assault that Mr Zishan did not survive.

'The brothers used some of the money they stole from him to buy more alcohol from a nearby garage. Later, when they realised what they'd done, they tried to dispose of the evidence by washing their clothes.

'But thanks to local people who came forward with information, we were able to quickly piece together what happened, arrest the suspects later that morning and build the case against them. 

Police videos revealed yesterday showed the McKinleys' apparent confusion at being told they were being arrested on suspicion of killing the 'family man'.

Several hours after the attack in the early hours of Sunday, March 30, police arrested both McKinleys on suspicion of murder and filmed the arrest with covert cameras.

When arrested, Jonathan was secretly recorded saying, 'What?!  'Are you f****** stupid?! Are you actually being stupid?! Nah, come on, seriously. Nah, be serious.'

During Samuel's arrest, he said: 'Can I explain what happened here or not? I just don't know what I'm arrested for. I've been arrested for murder? This is a joke.'

Three calls from witnesses to the police describing their accounts of the attack have also been released.

One caller said: 'There are three youths outside my house. Two of them seem to be beating another one up, demanding money off him.

'One of them is yelling 'Give me your money. Give me your money.' And one said 'It's okay, I've got him in a headlock.' And they seem to be crashing into cars and things.'

Another said: 'I think that someone's been mugged or attacked. I can see someone on the floor, and someone's saying 'Give me the money now'. Someone else was saying 'I will stab you if you don't give me the money.''

A witness added: 'There's a savage attack going on. They're battering him. They're hitting cars, going behind vans. They're chucking him around. You can hear it.'

Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, of Hampshire Police, said: 'There are agencies that can try and help people but some people are beyond help unfortunately. I suspect the McKinleys are in that situation.

'Choudhry Zishan was a family man and a businessman who was well known and liked within the community in Eastleigh.

Witnesses described how the father-of-one was crying in pain as the brothers carried out their violent attack

'He'd been walking to work on the morning of Sunday, March 30, when he was approached by the McKinley brothers who tried to rob him.

'They'd been drinking throughout the night and things escalated quickly to the point where they threatened him and began beating him.

'It was a senseless, brutal and sustained assault that Mr Zishan did not survive.

'The brothers used some of the money they stole from him to buy more alcohol from a nearby garage.

'Later, when they realised what they'd done, they tried to dispose of the evidence by washing their clothes.

'Our thoughts are with Mr Zishan's family.'
