At 35, Tim Cahill is still scoring goals for fun, whether it be for club, country... or into a basketball hoop from long distance.

The Australian forward has recently returned from a successful Asian Cup campaign, in which he helped his country lift the trophy on home turf, and is now preparing to begin his Chinese Super League career with Shanghai Shenhua.

Taking some time out away from the pitch, former Everton star Cahill took part in Weet-Bix's 'Trick Shot Challenge', tasked with kicking a football into a basketball hoop from various distances.

Starting at the free-throw line, Cahill moved further and further back on the court, kicking into the hoop

Beginning at the free-throw line, a relatively short distance from the hoop, the aim of the game is the gradually move further away, netting from four separate lines.

Cahill achieves the first goal, before moving back and netting from the three-point line, the mid-court line and finally the three-quarter line.

The video, which skips through his attempts to just show the successful kicks, times Cahill's challenge at 19 minutes and five seconds. 

The end of the clip challenges the viewer to give it a go themselves, tweeting #TC4weetbixtrickshots with their result... how many can you do?

The challenge finished with a kick from the three-quarter line, and Cahill completed it in just over 19 minutes
