President Barack Obama and 20 other world leaders participated in a tree-planting ceremony near Beijing on Tuesday, but the trees had already been planted by the Chinese government.

The fake photo-op came after a session of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.

'‎When the plenary was done, the leaders took part in a tree planting near the conference center,' a White House pool reporter wrote while Washington slept 13 time zones away.

'Actually, the evergreens were already planted when they got there – one tree for each country in APEC, each with a little pile of dirt and a shovel next to it.'

FAKE PLANTING: Obama dug a 'hole' in the dirt for a tree 'planting' -- but the already-planted evergreens can be seen behind him

NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION: Obama strode to his ceremonial shovel with his hands behind his back, while Russian president Vladimir Putin swaggered to his already-planted tree

'RAPPER': Chinese citizens slammed Obama on Tuesday for casually emerging from his limo at the APEC summit while chewing gum – which may have been his favorite stop-smoking aid

The result was 'a little future forest of eight-foot evergreens along a path of astro-turf.'

Photos show the president smirking as he grips a shovel and plunges it into a symbolic pile of dirt.

Russia's president, by contrast, swaggered to his tree,' according to the pool report. 

And Obama 'walked up with his hands clasped behind his back.'

After the tree 'planting,' Obama was heard telling a fellow head of state: 'Success!' 

The laid-back president took a moment to banter with a Spanish-language camera crew who called for his attention. 

'Hey, hombre!' he shouted with a wave. 

Obama's casual style has attracted online criticism from the Chinese people, who are accustomed to seeing their president, Xi Jinping maintain a strictly formal demeanor.

Live TV coverage broadcast on state-run networks showed him emerging from his limousine chewing gum.

Some users of the Sina Weibo microblogging service, a Chinese clone of Twitter,called him an impolite 'idler' and a careless 'rapper,' according to USA Today.

'We made this meeting so luxurious, with singing and dancing, but see Obama, stepping out of his car chewing gum like an idler,' wrote Yin Hong, a professor of journalism at Beijing's Tsinghua University.

The gum may have been Obama's way of coping with the stress of international diplomacy as he faces a rough final two years in the White House: He's known in Washington as a prolific user of nicotine gum as a stop-smoking measure. 

Fake flora on the grounds of the Yanqi Lake convention center, about 45 miles from central Beijing, include more than just pre-set evergreen trees.

The pool reporter noted 'lots of out of season flowers in the flower beds.'

'On close inspection, you see that they're in plastic flats or stuffed into green styrofoam.'

'SUCCESS!': Obama 'planted' his 'tree' and then chatted with Chilean president Michelle Bachelet

Obama told APEC attendees that the annual event 'has been able to provide an extraordinarily important forum for generating ideas that boost regional and then global integration, and has helped to provide jobs and support growth in all of our economies.'

He will leave Beijing on Wednesday for Naypyitaw, Myanmar, the site of this year's East Asia Summit.

The White House's official announcements have referred to that country as 'Burma,' in a hat-tip to pro-Democracy leaders there who resent the 1989 official name-change by an unelected military regime.

Obama's remaining schedule for the week calls for G20 summit events in Brisbane, Australia and a speech at the University of Queensland.

There are no additional tree-plantings on his calendar.
