Five seconds in Dallas changed the course of American history, and the men haunted most by the memories of that day are the ones who could have had a hand in preventing the tragedy.

The assassination of John F Kennedy more than 50 years ago has become a subject of intense scrutiny, with countless books and more than a dozen films devoted to investigating the shooting and its related conspiracy theories.

But agents' testimony and the findings of the Warren Commission point to simple steps that might have averted Kennedy's death, namely having the Secret Service agents better prepared for protecting Kennedy instead of staying out late and drinking the night before.

Sleep deprived: Four agents riding in a follow car had been out until around 3 a.m. before Kennedy's assassination

With the Secret Service in the midst of several scandals,Vanity Fair has taken another look at the readiness of the agency in 1963 and found the hard partying and lackadaisical attitude that plagues the agency now was a problem even then.

Veteran CBS broadcaster Bob Schieffer was just a beat reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in 1963, but he recalled on the night before the assassination being in the company of several Secret Service agents into the early hours.

Nine agents had wandered over to the Fort Worth Press Club from the Hotel Texas around midnight, searching for a bite to eat after a long day working the escort detail for the president's trip to Texas.

Finding the food already gone, agents made do with some scotch and sodas and a couple cans of beer before seven of the agents followed journalists to the Cellar, a late-night hangout in town.

'The Cellar was an all-night San Francisco–style coffee house down the street and some of the visiting reporters had heard about it and wanted to see it,' Schieffer explains.

'So we all went over there and some of the agents came along. The place didn’t have a liquor license, but they did serve liquor to friends—usually grain alcohol and Kool-Aid.'

Reflexes: Agent Clint Hill reacted to the first shot by racing up to the president's car, but reportedly struggled to get a hold on the back and scrambled to reach Jackie Kennedy and the fatally wounded president

As the night turned into early morning, several agents remained at what Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, who headed the Warren Commission investigating the assassination, termed a 'beatnik joint.'

Four of the agents admitting to be out until around 3 a.m. would be in the motorcade the next morning as the fatal shots struck President Kennedy.

After the assassination, Warren tore into James Rowley, the agents' supervisor at the Secret Service for not punishing agents for drinking, which was a punishable offense in the service.

Entourage: Kennedy and his wife were joined by Texas governor John Connally and his wife Nellie, as well as two senior agents whose advanced age and failure to react quickly was questioned after the assassination

'Don’t you think that if a man went to bed reasonably early, and hadn’t been drinking the night before,' Warren fumed, according to author Philip Shenon, 'he would be more alert than if he stayed up until three or five o’clock in the morning going to beatnik joints and doing some drinking along the way?'

Whether the agents had even gotten intoxicated has been a matter of debate. 'If they did have something to drink I never saw it,' Shieffer said. 'They may well have had.'

The Cellar's owner, Pat Kirkwood, wrote letters shortly after Kennedy's assassination asserting that the agents did not drink that night, but in 1984, he told the Star-Telegram that in spite of being a 'dry' club, the Cellar plied important people like policemen and politicians with significant portions of liquor.

'About 3:30, these Secret Service men were sitting around giggling about how the firemen were guarding the president over at the Hotel Texas,' Kirkwood stated. 

'After the agents were there we got a call from the White House,' the Cellar's manager Jimmy Hill said, 'asking us not to say anything about them drinking because their image had suffered enough as it was. We didn’t say anything but those guys were bombed. They were drinking pure Everclear,' grain alcohol sold at 151 and 190 proof.

The next morning the security detail working in the president's motorcade would include several agents who had stayed out past two according to their testimony to the Warren Commission. 

Kennedy reportedly disliked having agents in the crowd's line of sight or blocking him from greeting well-wishers along parade routes, so that day the president rode in a limousine with his wife, Texas governor John Connally and his wife Nellie.

Behind Kennedy was a follow car where agent Glen Bennet was seated. On footboards attached to the car stood agent Clint Hill on one side with agents Jack Ready and Paul Landis on the other. All four had stayed up until around 3 a.m., with Landis admitting he stayed out until 5 a.m.

Justice Warren noted that some attendees noted seeing the barrel of a gun sticking out of the Texas School Book Depository and questioned why the service members didn't see it.

'Wouldn’t a Secret Service man in this motorcade, who is supposed to observe such things, be more likely to observe something of that kind if he was free from any of the results of liquor or lack of sleep than he would have otherwise?' 

Video from Abraham Zapruder, then a 58-year-old dress manufacturer shooting on a Bell & Howell film camera, shows the first shot strike Kennedy, who draws his fists up to his face in pain. 

'I knew right away it was a gunshot,' says Landis today. 

But the agents were slow to react. At the wheel of Kennedy's car was 54-year-old agent William Greer, whose advanced age was also questioned after the assassination, and instead of accelerating or swerving he pressed the brakes, according to witnesses.

Of the agents in the follow car, only Hill raced towards the president. By the time he reached the car in front of him, another shot, this one fatal, had struck Kennedy in the side of the head.

Vanity Fair compares the actions to what happened three cars behind Kennedy, where agent Rufus Youngblood sat with Vice President Lyndon B Johnson.

At the sound of the first shot, Youngblood, who had not been at the Press Club or the Cellar, followed his service training and pushed Johnson to the floor and covered him with his body.

Though it is difficult to say 50 years out what, if anything, could have saved Kennedy, in the few seconds between the first shot that hit Kennedy and the next, there may have been a window where his life could have been saved.

For Clint Hill, one of the agents who had been out the night before, those seconds have weighed heavily for years.

'It was my fault,' he told Mike Wallace in 1975. 'If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. . . . I’ll live with that to my grave.'
