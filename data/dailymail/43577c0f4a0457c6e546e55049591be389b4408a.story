A 250 mile-long river valley flowing 
with liquid hydrocarbons has been spotted on Titan by scientists using 
Nasa's Cassini space probe.

It is the first time a river system 
this vast has been seen anywhere other than Earth, and Nasa are saying 
it appears like a miniature, extraterrestrial likeness of the our own 
planet's Nile River.

The river valley crosses Titan's north
polar region and runs north into Ligeia Mare, one of the three great 
seas in the moon's high northern latitudes.

There are some short, local meanders, 
but the its relative straightness suggests it follows the trace of at 
least one fault, similar to other rivers running into the southern 
margin of Ligeia Mare.

Such faults may lead to the opening of basins and perhaps to the formation of the giant seas themselves.

Scientists believe the river is filled
with liquid hydrocarbons as it looks dark along its entire length in 
the radar image, indicating a smooth surface.

Titan is Saturn's largest moon, 
roughly 80 per cent more massive than our own Moon, and the only 
satellite known to have a dense atmosphere.

It is the only other world we know of 
that has stable liquid on its surface, but while Earth's hydrologic 
cycle relies on water, Titan's equivalent cycle involves hydrocarbons 
such as ethane and methane.

In Titan's equatorial regions, photos 
taken in late 2010 by Cassini's visible-light cameras revealed regions 
that darkened due to recent rainfall.

Cassini's visual and infrared mapping 
spectrometer confirmed liquid ethane at a lake in Titan's southern 
hemisphere known as Ontario Lacus in 2008.

Cassini is a Flagship-class robotic spacecraft sent to explore Saturn and its moons as part of a joint mission between Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.

It launched in 1997 and finally arrived at the system in 2004 after an interplanetary voyage which included flybys of Earth, Venus, and Jupiter.

It also included an atmospheric probe called Huygens which landed on Titan on 2005 to investigate its clouds, atmosphere and surface.

It successfully returned data to Earth, using the orbiter as a relay, after what was was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System.

On April 16, 2008, Nasa announced a two-year extension of the funding for ground operations of this mission, at which point it was renamed to the Cassini Equinox Mission.

This was again extended in February 2010 with the Cassini Solstice Mission continuing until 2017. The current end of mission plan is a 2017 controlled fall into Saturn's atmosphere.

'Titan is the only place we've found 
besides Earth that has a liquid in continuous movement on its surface,' 
said Steve Wall, the radar deputy team lead, based at NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.

'This picture gives us a snapshot of a
world in motion. Rain falls, and rivers move that rain to lakes and 
seas, where evaporation starts the cycle all over again.

'On Earth, the liquid is water; on Titan, it's methane; but on both it affects most everything that happens.'

The radar image taken on September 26 
and published by Nasa yesterday shows where the river valley flows into 
Kraken Mare, a sea that is, in terms of size, between the Caspian Sea 
and the Mediterranean Sea.

'Though there are some short, local 
meanders, the relative straightness of the river valley suggests it 
follows the trace of at least one fault,'said Jani Radebaugh, a Cassini 
radar team associate at Brigham Young University, Utah.

She added: 'Such faults - fractures in
Titan's bedrock - may not imply plate tectonics, like on Earth, but 
still lead to the opening of basins and perhaps to the formation of the 
giant seas themselves.'

The real Nile River stretches about 
4,100 miles. The processes that led to the formation of Earth's Nile are
complex, but involve faulting in some regions.
