First they were invited to join the Queen at church on Christmas morning.

Now the Middletons are believed to have been given a coveted invitation to join a royal shooting party.

Sources told the Daily Mail that the Duchess of Cambridge’s parents Michael and Carole, plus her siblings, Pippa and James, all accompanied Prince William hunting pheasant on Saturday on the monarch’s private Sandringham Estate.

Royal invitation: Keen to show off their new ten-bedroom mansion, Anmer Hall, William and Kate are hosting an extravagant festive celebration for Michael, Carole, James and Pippa

It is not known whether other senior royals were part of the gathering, although it is unlikely that the Queen or Prince Philip would have ventured out.

Current guests at Sandringham include Prince Charles, Princess Anne and her son, Peter Phillips, as well as the Earl and Countess of Wessex.

The one notable absentee, however, was Kate, who is expecting her second child in April.

She stayed at the couple’s new country mansion Anmer Hall, just a few miles away, with Prince George, before apparently joining the group for afternoon tea up at the main house.

In recent years the Middletons have enthusiastically embraced the hunting, shooting and fishing set.

In November 2010, just weeks before their daughter’s engagement to Prince William was announced, Mr and Mrs Middleton were photographed shooting on the Queen’s Scottish estate, Balmoral.

First they were invited to join the Queen at church on Christmas morning. Now the Middletons are believed to have been given a coveted invitation to join a royal shooting party 

The couple, accompanied by William and Kate, were seen being instructed by a ghillie in how to stalk deer in the hills above Birkhall, Charles’s Highland mansion on the edges of the estate, where the family were staying.

Commentators regarded their presence there as a deeply significant moment for the former air hostess and her airline despatcher husband, who have made a fortune from their business selling party goods.

Now there is an appearance at Sandringham, the Queen’s beloved Norfolk home which was left to her by her late father, King George VI.

The Queen takes up residence there every Christmas until after the anniversary of his death on February 6.

Sources have told the Mail that William and his guests left Anmer Hall promptly on Saturday morning and deliberately chose to shoot in an area of land not overlooked by public footpaths.

After an ‘exhausting’ morning, the entire party enjoyed a slap-up lunch at Wood Farm, a private residence on the 20,000-acre Norfolk estate, courtesy of the Queen.

The shooters were driven there in a covered wagon accompanied by their guns and dogs – possibly including William and Kate’s pet cocker spaniel, Lupo, who has been given gun dog training.

It is believed that the party – joined by the Duchess of Cambridge – were then treated to high tea at the main house, where the Queen is staying.

The Middletons were also invited by the Queen to join her family at church on Christmas Day, although they chose to drive themselves and arrived shortly before the royal party at the main entrance.

As revealed by the Daily Mail, William’s in-laws arrived in Norfolk more than a week ago for what has been described as a ‘perfect family Christmas’. 

Keen to show off their new ten-bedroom mansion, Anmer Hall, just a few miles from Sandringham House, William and Kate have been hosting an extravagant festive celebration for the entire Middleton clan.

The house, which boasts its own swimming pool and tennis court, was a wedding gift from the Queen and has recently undergone a multi-million pound refit.

‘The Duchess has long been keen to host big family Christmas in her new home, the kind of Christmas she enjoyed as a girl,’ a source said.

After briefly meeting with fellow royals at the main house after Church, William and Kate left to join the Middletons for lunch at Anmer – a distinct break with royal tradition.
