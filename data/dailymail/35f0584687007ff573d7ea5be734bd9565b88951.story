The second MailOnline Fantasy Football Grand Master of the season can be revealed - Mrs Radostina Staneva, who lives in east London.

The manager of Tina (yes, that's really her team name) scoops the second £1,000 weekly prize after a weekend performance inspired by Tottenham and Man City players which saw her earn a whopping 283 Fantasy Football points.

Like Kevin Brown, the winner on Week One, Mrs Staneva will now have to wait until the January transfer window before she can replenish her side after using all 16 transfers last weekend to secure the prize.

Team Tina featured three different goalkeepers - Thibault Courtois, Hugo Lloris and Joe Hart - over the weekend. And selecting City frontmen Stevan Jovetic and Edin Dzeko up front on Monday proved decisive. 

Here, Mrs Staneva, who is 52 and supports Arsenal, explains her strategy: 'Before I started playing towards the second week competition I looked at the entire round of fixtures. I made a prediction of all 10 games.  

Prize pair: Stevan Jovetic (left) and Edin Dzeko (right) starred for Man City in their 3-1 win over Liverpool

'I wanted to make sure I get at least 30 points from Saturday excluding other bonuses (such as goals, assists etc). 

'I constructed a bench consisting of cheap players playing on Sunday. I picked a Tottenham bench featuring Harry Kane (£5.5m) as I knew that he will come as a sub and bring bonus points for a win. I had Darren Fletcher as he was very cheap and also playing on Sunday. 

'I played cheap bench so that I can accommodate players from Man City (who are the most expensive in the game). In other words, I was thinking about the final game on Monday when I started building my team.

'I predicted a comfortable win for Chelsea so I started with Chelsea's almost entire team and some other cheap players, such as Neil Taylor (I expected Swansea to win), Scott Arfield is in starting the XI and Marouane Chamakh (who paid off for his price with a goal), around them.

'On Sunday I focused onTottenham as QPR's record at White Hart Lane is poor and they have just recruited new defenders who need time to gel together. Man Utd have new coach while Hull-Stoke was unpredictable and that is why I ignored these two fixtures.

The winning formula: Mrs Staneva's winning side on Monday after using all her 16 transfers

'As for Monday, Liverpool did not play well in the game last week against Southampton so I predicted Man City's win. Having said that I accommodated nine Man City players in order to collect around 27 points only for a win.' 

Check out Mrs Staneva's winning team (above) and remember, it's not too late for you to enter a team and go for the £1,000 weekly prize - you have 36 more week's to claim a prize!

All you have to do is be the top manager on one of the 38 Premier League game weeks to be crowned a Grand Master. Cumulative points over the season do not count towards the weekly prize.
