Gareth Bale just isn't content with being one of the best wingers in the world, the Real Madrid maestro clearly fancies his chances in goal, too.

The 25-year-old was training with his Wales team-mates ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifying match against Belgium and, instead of putting balls in the back of the net, the former Tottenham Hotspur star tried his hand at stopping them.

Those at White Hart Lane can only wish they hadn't traded Bale for Â£85million now as they sit 12th in the Barclays Premier League, and the forward can make his former fans wince even more when he takes to the pitch in Brussels on Sunday evening.

Wales make the trip sitting top of Group B after three games, having beaten Andorra and Cyprus, and drawn with Bosnia-Herzegovina. A win for Belgium would see Marc Wilmots' side leapfrog Wales, though Chris Coleman is confident the points are there for the taking.

'We go into the game in Brussels on the back of only one defeat in eight games now,' said Coleman. 'We are up against a very good Belgium side, World Cup quarter finalists and ranked fourth in the world at the moment.

'But we are a good side as well. We have an excellent squad, a tremendous squad spirit and mentality. We have proved that in the campaign to date, and especially over the past couple of home matches.

'The support from the fans has been incredible. Last year we took nearly 1,500 to Brussels. They were magnificent. This time we will be taking nearly two and a half thousand and could have taken far more. We want to repay them in the best way possible, with a positive performance and result.'
