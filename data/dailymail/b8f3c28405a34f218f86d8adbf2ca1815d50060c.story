My friends have always called me a magpie. I'm drawn to all that glitters and working as a TV, film, and stage actress since the age of five, I've been lucky enough to come across my fair share of bling, some real, some very fake.

Over the years though I've gradually learnt that less is often more and tried to temper my tastes, and budget, to match. So it was with great excitement that I heard about Poundland's new jewellery range.

As a lover of costume jewellery, I know that dramatic and wildly glamorous necklaces can cost from almost nothing to thousands of pounds, but £1? Surely that doesn't even stretch to a decent clasp

To see how convincing cheap jewellery is - and whether it's ever worth forking out a fortune for - I put eight necklaces priced between £1 to £1,000 to the test. 

Feels expensive 

Fooled: Jane thought this necklace was expensive

This must cost hundreds. The stones are beautifully iridescent with shimmering blues, purples and greens and, in places, layered upon one another.

It looks as if it's been carefully put together.

The distressed gold chain is glitzy but not too shiny and it feels weighty and substantial.

A carefully considered neckline is essential as it's so wide it almost touches my shoulders. This would work will with a strapless gown or boat-neck top.

GUESS PRICE: £500

REAL PRICE: £29.99

Simply charming 

Sweet but cheap: But costs more than a £1

Sweet but uninspiring, the chain looks breakable and I worry this wouldn't last more than a couple of outings.

The woven gold design is nothing terribly special and little thought has gone into its length which comes up an inch too short.

It’s probably the cheapest of the lot and could cost £1 but it's perfectly acceptable to fill in a neckline and worn with the right thing could pass for gold if you didn’t look too closely.

GUESS PRICE: £1

REAL PRICE: £14

Striking and elegant 

Thumbs up: Jane didn't guess this was the cheapest

Clearly this comes from the lower end of the High Street.

It looks simply put together and is so dainty it could blow away in a strong wind.

Having said that, the asymmetric leaf design is striking and elegant and the gold metal reflects the light and sits beautifully.

I'd happily buy and wear this during the day layered over a simple white T-shirt or with a plunge-neck evening gown.

GUESS PRICE: £20

REAL PRICE: £1

Pricey but garish 

Too much: Doesn't look expensive

You have to be in the right mood for this. It's brash, over-the-top and luminous with an Aladdin's cave of colours and sparkling jewels.

It looks the most expensive as a lot of work seems to have gone into crafting it, with so many intricate settings.

The clasp is gold-plated and robust. 

There's no chance of this slipping off into the soup during supper but it's far too overwhelming for me to wear. 

Though probably expensive, oddly enough it makes me feel cheap.

GUESS PRICE: £1,000

REAL PRICE: £580

Shourouk jewel and neon stone necklace, benna.co.uk

Gaudy glitter 

Plastic looking: But it costs £70

On stage this would be great as you'd assume it was real diamonds but up close it looks like cheap glitter, probably from Accessorize or somewhere similar.

The design is pretty enough, but I shy away from silver and plain crystal as it washes out my fair complexion.

I'd rather save up for a real diamond than buy this plastic looking piece of frippery.

GUESS PRICE: £30

REAL PRICE: £70

Lovely but flimsy 

Favourite: Jane loved the colours

From afar this looks like tacky fairground jewellery but once on, it's one of my favourites.

Sitting comfortably around my neck, it doesn't twist or pucker. 

The deep greens, blues and turquoises are almost ethereal but the clasp is depressingly bulky yet flimsy.

It looks like it might break easily. I would wear this, but reckon it's on the cheaper side...

GUESS PRICE: £50

REAL PRICE: £279

Rada necklace, Fenwick, 020 7629 9161

Style over substance 

Flimsy: But this one costs £1,000

This looks like a pretender. It's matte gold with sparkly jewels trying to look like diamonds and rubies. Some of the spiky edges dig into my neck and no matter how I adjust it it won't lie flat.

I wrestled with the clasp, too. The design is faintly art deco and I can imagine Wallis Simpson gadding about in something similar, but there is no finesse to the finish. I wouldn't spend too much on it.

GUESS PRICE: £100

REAL PRICE: £1,000

Andy Farrow 18ct gold plated necklace, wolfandbadger.co.uk

Egyptian chic 

Wearable: Looks expensive

What a classy necklace. Rows of carefully set stones, shiny gold and threaded ribbon gives this a slightly Egyptian feel.

I’m often intimidated by oversized, overly gaudy items - I find they look too young on an older person - but this is wearable and dramatic without being try-hard.

I’d happily wear it with simple evening dresses.

GUESS PRICE: £250

REAL PRICE: £55
