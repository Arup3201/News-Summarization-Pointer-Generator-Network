'Shoo-in': Double Olympic gold medallist Lord Coe is the 'clear favourite' to become BBC Chairman, according to the corporation's economics editor

Olympics boss Sebastian Coe is a ‘virtual shoo-in’ to become the next chairman of the BBC, it was claimed yesterday.

The former track star and head of the London 2012 Games is expected to replace Lord Patten, who stood down after heart surgery in May.

Several candidates are currently being interviewed for the post, including the temporary chair Diane Coyle.

But writing in his online blog, the BBC’s economics editor Robert Peston said he had learned from a ‘senior government source’ that Lord Coe was the clear favourite.

He said: ‘Of course his appointment is not 100 per cent, because there is a formal and slightly cumbersome appointments process.

‘For the Government, which for this sort of thing really means the Prime Minister and Chancellor, Lord Coe is the outstanding candidate. So presumably they will find a way to get him over these many hurdles.’

Some speculated yesterday that Peston’s source was the Chancellor George Osborne. Peston is currently shadowing Osborne’s official trade mission to India, and the Chancellor is known to be a close friend of Lord Coe’s.

Lord Coe’s appointment would be popular with Tory MPs. Unlike Lord Patten – who is now advising the Pope on media relations – he is seen as a ‘true Conservative’, and he served as a Tory MP for five years.

The double Olympic gold medallist has also worked with BBC director general Tony Hall, who sat on the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games.

Lord Coe was first rumoured to be in line for the BBC chairman role in May.

At the time, London Mayor Boris Johnson appeared to inadvertently confirm the story when he said that he would be a ‘first-rate choice’.

Lord Coe has not confirmed or denied the reports, although he has said he would be ‘very flattered’ to be considered a contender.

Yesterday, another contender for the £110,000 job – former Ofcom head Colette Bowe – ruled herself out of contention for the post, saying she felt the current BBC structure was ‘hopelessly confused.’

She said: ‘I think that hopeless confusion has served the BBC and the licence fee payers very ill, despite the enormous efforts of good people to try and make it work. There is no desire or inclination among the powers that be to change the system. I haven’t applied, I don’t intend to apply.’

Dame Colette also called for the BBC to scrap the licence fee and replace it with a subscription model. She said: I have to say it seems to be a no brainer moment to look at conditional access funding. Why not? Why wouldn’t they do it? I haven’t seen a single argument that persuaded me that some kind of conditional access wouldn’t be a good thing.’

Her comments were echoed by Channel 4 chairman Lord Burns, who also said he did not want the BBC chairman post.

He said: ‘Can you really imagine in 30 years’ time there will be a licence fee? In the long term you have to get to a position where people who don’t pay can’t watch it. That is subscription. The BBC would be a not for profit company, it would still have a charter, it would still have various privileges, but it would have to persuade people to pay for it.’
