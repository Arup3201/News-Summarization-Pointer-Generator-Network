An Australian dentists' association has apologised unreservedly after raunchy footage from a late night burlesque event held at its conference was posted online.  

The video - believed to have been filmed in Melbourne last year - was a promotion for the Australian Dental Association’s national congress due to be held in Brisbane in 2015.

It featured strippers performing in underwear not much thicker than dental floss who gyrated sexually on stage before entwining themselves in rope and hanging from the ceiling.

Within hours of the clip being uploaded to YouTube, the ADA’s website and social media accounts, the organisation was hit with a slew of complaints and accusations that the event was sexist, forcing chief executive Robert Boyd-Boland to order its removal.

Mr Boyd-Boland told the Courier Mail the video sent 'an inappropriate signal about the event' and would investigate who was responsible for uploading it.

According to the ADA’s website, 90 per cent of dentists around Australia are members.

In a statement, a spokeswoman for the ADA told Mail Online the burlesque performance comprised only a small portion of the event but apologised 'unreservedly' for the offence it had caused.

'The video of the event in question was a small excerpt of a portion of the entertainment from the Dentists ‘Late Night’ at the 2013 Australian Dental Congress in Melbourne.

'This event was a burlesque show with the most risqué portion of the event being showcased by media, ignoring the rest of the two-hour acrobatic show,' she said.

'No complaints were ever received about the program. It is unfortunate this story has developed in such a way. The ADA certainly had no intention of painting the profession in a negative light. The ADA unreservedly apologises for any offence caused by the inadvertent posting of the offending video.

'Immediate action has been taken by the ADA to remove it.'

The upcoming 36th annual conference, sponsored by Investec, will be held at the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre and will again feature an 'exclusive' Dentist Late Night.

The 2015 edition looks set for more teethy grins with conference chairman Dr David Thomson promising: 'Social activities will be available for relaxation purposes.'

Earlier this month an Australian television ad for chocolate bar Snickers drew international scorn for featuring construction workers wolf-whistling at passing females.
