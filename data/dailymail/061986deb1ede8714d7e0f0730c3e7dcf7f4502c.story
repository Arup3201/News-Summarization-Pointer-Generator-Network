The star of the NBA draft lottery last night wasn't a big-name team owner - it was the very pretty 18-year-old daughter of Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wesley Edens.

When Mallory Edens was chosen by her millionaire father to represent his team at the yearly ping-pong ball pull, she had no idea what an impression she would make.

But thanks to her good looks and charming demeanor, the high school senior became an overnight internet sensation, amassing tens of thousands of Twitter followers, receiving marriage proposals and even having songs written about her.

NBA fans took to Twitter to voice their infatuation with the teenager - after checking to make sure she was of age, of course.

'Mallory Edens is winning the NBA Draft Lottery. Yes, I googled to make sure she is 18,' wrote one admirer.

Another fan tweeted: 'I still remember the day before I was in love with Mallory Edens. It was yesterday.'

After drawing the ping-pong ball and bringing in the number two pick for her dad's team, Mallory revealed that she never imagined it would be her up on that stage.

'He sort of brought it up in passing one 
time and I thought he was joking,' she said to JSOnline about her father, who also has an older daughter and a son. 'And then here I am, so I suppose it 
wasn't a joke.

'I was really nervous but really happy to
 get the second pick,' she said. 'I was extremely

And of course, her father couldn't have been prouder of his daughter - though he may or may not be pleased with the sensation she has instantly become.

'It was 
kind of our first official day, and itâ€™s a dream come true,' he said in an interview after the draft.

'We're very excited to be here, and to be here with my 
family and our friends is really special. We're happy with the outcome. 
We could have been number one, but number two is pretty good.'
