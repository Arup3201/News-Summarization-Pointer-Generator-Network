Dangerous: The tool can reach 220C, leading to numerous serious incidents with infants

Children who use hair straighteners increasingly risk burns - especially around Christmas time, according to doctors.

Youngsters are up to three times more likely to be injured soon after Christmas, according to new research.

Shockingly, most of the children injured are aged under two. The study said owners need to be better informed about handling the devices.

It recommended that straighteners be put in heat-resistant pouches after use, to reduce the risk of burns.

Retail research revealed that one in three women own hair tongs.

The number of consumers owning straighteners rose from 4.6 million in 2007 to 5.3 million in 2010.

Dr Julia Sarginson, who led the research at the burns centre at Bristol’s Frenchay Hospital, said: ‘Hair-straightening devices can cause significant injuries.

‘Our study shows that infants and toddlers are at most risk, and these are preventable burns that warrant our attention.’

The researchers, whose findings appear in Burns journal, say that straighteners have become more popular over the past decade because of increased availability, a fall in prices and the fashion for straight hair. A popular Christmas gift, they retail for as little as £20.

A 2011 review by Electrical Safety Council warned: ‘The hair straightener [may not be] shaped or decorated like a toy... nevertheless, the brightly coloured enclosure might still be considered appealing as a plaything by young children.’

The council advised parents ‘to keep the hot surfaces away from exploring fingers’, even though tongs are being increasingly sold in heat-proof bags or clips.

A potential hazard is that the plates can reach 220C, hotter than household appliances such as an iron, at 180C. A further hazard is the length of time it takes for them to cool after use; the researchers say that straighteners can cause burns up to 15 minutes after being turned off.

The South West Regional Paediatric Burns Centre in Bristol looked at the growing number of cases and the damage caused. Doctors found there had been 155 cases admitted over a five-year period, and that the number of cases had increased from 20 to 45 a year.

Eight cases were serious enough to require skin grafts.

Seven out of 10 injuries were in children under two. The average age for injured children under five was 17 months for boys and 21 months for girls.

Last December it emerged that High street stores were refusing to sell children’s hair straighteners after a dramatic increase in burns injuries.

Doctors expressed concerned over an increasing number of girls suffering burns and scars from the appliances.

The brightly coloured devices are sometimes decorated with pictures of princesses, fairies and cartoon characters -images more suitable for a toy.

The stores - Argos, Tesco and Asda - acted after worrying figures from the National Burns Injuries Database.

The statistics revealed the number of children aged under 15 admitted to serious burns units in England and Wales with injuries from adult appliances increased from 162 in 2009 to 252 last year.

Items withdrawn by Argos included Disney Princess Rapunzel Straighten and Crimp Straighteners, Disney Rapunzel’s Multi Hair Styler, Hello Kitty Mini Straightener and boy band One Direction branded hair straighteners. Tesco dropped a Disney Fairies Tinker-bell Straightener.

Dr Amber Young, a consultant paediatric anaesthetist at Frenchay Hospital Burns Unit in Bristol and spokeswoman for the British Burns Association, said in December 2012: ‘There has to be a health warning about the use of straighteners - and these products should certainly not be marketed to children.’
