Justice: Gisela S was a guard at the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland, where more than 1million people were exterminated

This grainy photograph shows the female Auschwitz death-camp guard who is set to stand trial on charges of aiding in mass murder.

The woman, who is now 90 years old and has been identified only as Gisela S, worked at the camp under her maiden name Demming.

If convicted, she will be among a handful of the 3,700 women employed to oversee female prisoners to face justice.

Gisela S. is the second person within
 a week judged to be fit to answer charges relating to their roles in 
the camp in occupied Poland where some 1.1million people, mostly Jews, 
were killed.

The other 
is Oskar Groening, 92, who was in charge of sending back the possessions
 and money of the doomed to his SS masters in Berlin.

Gisela
 S is now living in a home near Hamburg, and has been described as a 
fanatical Nazi supporter who early on in the Nazi regime joined the BDM,
 the League of German Maidens, before entering the SS in 1940.

The
 Federal Archive in Berlin threw up her SS identity card for war crimes 
investigators. It shows a cold, hard-faced woman who worked in Auschwitz
 in 1944 under her maiden name of Demming.

It is claimed at Asuchwitz she was a 
harsh disciplinarian who beat prisoners and who was often in charge of 
the standing cells - small, dark rooms where up to 15 people at a time 
were crammed in for minor rule infractions. It was not uncommon to leave
 people in these rooms for days on end, causing the death of some or all
 of those confined.

She formed a romantic relationship 
with SS doctor Franz Bernhard Lucas, but dropped him when he railed 
against the hideous experiments on prisoners carried out by notorious 
‘Angel of Death’ Dr Josef Mengele on inmates.

She appeared at the Auschwitz Trial of former guards and overseers in Frankfurt in the 1960s but escaped jail.

The
 conviction of Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk in 2011, who was 
tried in Munich on charges of assisting in the murders of 28,060 Dutch 
Jews, means that prosecutors no longer need expert witness testimony 
about what individuals did in death camps, proving that they were there 
is now enough to bring about charges of complicity in mass murder.

Nana Frombach, a spokeswoman for the 
public prosecutor’s office in Hamburg, confirmed the investigation which
 should lead to charges later this year.

A lawyer paid for by the German
 taxpayer has been assigned to her.

Gisela S is one of 30 former Auschwitz personnel still living in Germany now under the microscope of war crime hunters. Six are women.

The most notorious guard was Irma Ida Grese, employed at the Nazi concentration camps of Ravensbrück and Auschwitz, and was a warden of the women’s section of Bergen-Belsen.

Grese was convicted for crimes against humanity at the Belsen Trial and sentenced to death aged 22.
