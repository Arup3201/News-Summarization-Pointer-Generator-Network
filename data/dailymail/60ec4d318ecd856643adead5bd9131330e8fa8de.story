The BBC was accused of fostering a ‘culture of secrecy’ yesterday after imposing a gagging order on its new director-general.

Tony Hall’s £450,000-a-year contract contains a clause which bans him from making ‘any derogatory or unfavourable public remark’ about the broadcaster while he is in the post – or for two years afterwards.

Critics said it was ‘deeply worrying’ that the BBC was still attempting to gag its senior executives following accusations that the corporation sought to cover up allegations of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile.

Lord Hall, who started work last week, told BBC staff the organisation was ‘learning the lessons’ of the past year.

But the gagging clause has raised questions about his ability to speak freely about faults he finds within the BBC.

The contract stipulates: ‘You will not, without the prior written consent of the BBC, whether during the period of your appointment or within two years following the termination date, write for publication or make any public statement about the BBC or its affairs.

‘You shall not at any time during the period of your appointment or within two years following the  termination date make any derogatory or unfavourable public remark or statement whether orally or in writing with regard to the BBC, member of the BBC Group, member of the BBC Trust, member of the Executive Committee, employee, customer, client or supplier of the BBC and/or member of the BBC Group.’

The BBC said the contract did not ban Lord Hall, 62, from ‘whistle-blowing’ about failures and said the clause was a routine inclusion in contracts for every member of its executive board, including previous director-general George Entwistle.

But it does appear to make it more difficult for Lord Hall to change the culture of the BBC by being open about its failings.

Critics said the inclusion of the clause suggested the BBC had failed to learn lessons from recent scandals, including the Savile affair.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is deeply worrying that the BBC would try to gag its senior executives, especially after the lessons it should have learned from recent failings.

‘BBC management should practice what BBC journalists try to encourage in other organisations – openness and transparency.

‘A culture of secrecy meant Jimmy Savile’s crimes never came to light early enough to stop them.

‘The danger of a gagging clause is that a recently departed director-general could be prevented from raising an issue publicly that licence fee payers should rightly know.’

BBC sources said the contract was not intended to stop Lord Hall from acknowledging faults within the corporation, including during his appearances before MPs at the Culture, Media and Sport Committee.

He is expected to face questions over widespread redactions in the Pollard Review, the £2million inquiry into why a Newsnight investigation of Savile was axed.

Under the terms of his contract, Lord Hall will be entitled to a £225,000 payout, even if he proves to be a failure. Mr Entwistle walked away with £450,000, the equivalent of 12 months’ notice, despite spending only 54 days in the job before resigning.

It is the first time the BBC Trust has published a director-general’s contract. It said it had done so ‘in the interests of transparency’.

Employment lawyers said gagging clauses had become common for senior executives.

A spokesman said the BBC was reviewing its use of such clauses. He said: ‘We recognise that confidentiality clauses are a cause for public concern.

‘Their use at the BBC is something that we are currently looking at as part of the Respect At Work Review and we expect to have something to say on the matter very shortly.’
