A solicitor has launched a High Court libel action against a property millionaire client who accused him of charging £4,050 for a day’s legal work whilst he was actually playing golf.

Businessman Colin Sullivan, 69, claims his former lawyer Stewart Brian Wiseman spent a ‘whole day’ playing golf at the prestigious Dyrham Park Country Club in Hertfordshire, instead of handling a case for him in November 2009.

The High Court heard that Mr Sullivan became enraged when he received a bill charging him for 13 and a half hours toil at £300 an hour for that day.

The wealthy developer ‘plastered’ his Range Rover with ‘offensive notices’ and first parked it outside the lawyer’s home in Clerkenwell, then outside his offices in Duke Street, Central London, the High Court was told.

The notices - one of which read, ‘Stewart Wiseman took a full day off to play golf plus a half day for personal reasons yet charged me for 13 and a half hour days’ - were photographed by a passerby and ended up being posted on an internet discussion board.

Mr Sullivan, of Brentwood, in Essex, also claims his former lawyer submitted a bill for his full hourly rate for two ‘friendly’ dinners the pair enjoyed at his expense.

The case throws a spotlight on the way lawyers calculate their fees at an hourly rate.

Mr Wiseman flatly denies the allegations and is now suing Mr Sullivan for alleged defamation, asking Mr Justice Eady to grant him ‘significant’ damages on the basis that his professional reputation was tarnished by the ‘extremely serious allegation of fraud’ made by his former client.

The court heard the disputed charge for the alleged ‘golf day’ was part of a £37,800 bill for Mr Wiseman handling High Court litigation involving three of Mr Sullivan’s companies, in October and November 2009.

Mark Tomassi, for Mr Sullivan, told the judge: ‘The important allegation is that he was charging for a full day’s, 13 and a half hours, work when he took the full day off and charged for it.’

The barrister, addressing Mr Wiseman in the witness box, put to him that evidence showed that he had also charged his client £600 for a two-hour meeting they had in a cafe and alleged that he had also put in a bill for his full hourly rate for two ‘friendly’ dinners out the pair had enjoyed at Mr Sullivan’s expense.

‘You would be wined and dined and subsequently you presented Mr Sullivan with a bill which charged him £300 for each hour you were dining...It cost him £600 for the pleasure of your company for two hours in a cafe,’ the barrister said.

Mr Wiseman accepted he charged for the two-hour meeting in the cafe but denied presenting a bill for the evening dinners.

Mr Tomassi told the judge that, for Mr Sullivan to defend successfully the defamation claim, ‘what needs to be justified is the allegation that he (Mr Wiseman) was charging for 13 and a half hour days when he was playing golf or away from the office for other purposes.’

Jacob Dean, for Mr Wiseman, told the court his client admits he is a member of the country club and played golf there during the time he was advising Mr Sullivan.

However he maintains he only charged his client for two hours work on the crucial day, work which he did.

‘At the heart of this case is an allegation that my client charged Mr Sullivan for time he was on the golf course...If that allegation is not proved, the libel is proved,’ he told the judge.

‘He accepts he played golf on Novemeber 20, starting at 11am, and two hours were charged for that day. That is the amount of work that he did for that day,’ the barrister added.

Mr Wiseman himself, in the witness box, said he had worked as a solicitor for 40 years and dismissed the allegations against him as ‘absolute nonsense.’

Insisting he had charged Mr Sullivan reasonably, he added: ‘I was full on from the moment I had instructions and dealt with a great deal of work.’

Asking for a substantial award of libel damages, Mr Dean said: ‘This libel clearly touches on the core attributes of Mr Wiseman’s professional reputation, accusing him of being a dishonest solicitor fraudulently charging for work which was not done.’

The High Court hearing, set to last four days, continues.
