Cleared of GBH: Stephen Davies, 40, of Pontypridd, ran over his wife’s hand with the Flymo mower

A maths teacher who cut off his wife’s finger with a lawn mower during an argument walked free from court today.

Stephen Davies, 40, of Pontypridd, South Wales, ran over his wife’s hand with the Flymo mower - chopping off the index finger on her left hand.

Claire Davies claimed her husband - whom she is divorcing - had deliberately swung the hover mower at her during a row in their garden.

But a court heard Mr Davies claimed his wife had fallen in the path of the mower after ‘deliberately standing on the lead’ in the garden.

A Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court jury cleared him of causing grievous bodily harm after he told how it was a ‘freak accident’ when she lost her finger.

The court heard how Mr Davies had been ‘in a mood’ as he mowed the lawn on a day off. Mrs Davies, a self-employed optician, stood on the mower’s power cable to try to make him stop.

But he allegedly tried to free it from underneath her foot, when it caused his wife to fall to the grass under the Flymo’s spinning blades.

Mr Davies said: ‘I told her she was standing on the wire and to get off, I got frustrated. I gave the mower an extra shove outwards. The wire was taut and the mower flicked up off the ground. She fell forward.’

Mr Davies turned around to see what had happened - with the motor still running - and his wife’s hand went under the blade.

Mrs Davies lost the index finger of 
her left hand which was found on the grass. She was treated by doctors 
but they were unable to reattach her finger and she now needs to wear a 
prosthesis.

Mr Davies, head of the mathematics department at Blaengwawr Comprehensive School in Aberdare, denied grievous bodily harm.

The jury of three men and nine women took
 15 minutes to clear him after hearing references from colleagues who 
commended his ‘professionalism’.

Lucy Crowther, defending, said: ‘It is quite a tragedy this court has been used to sort out their matrimonial situation.’

Following the incident the couple started divorce proceedings and have attended mediation sessions to attempt to resolve financial and child contact issues.
