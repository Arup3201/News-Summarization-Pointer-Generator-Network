Artificial leaves have been shown to harness solar energy and turn it into hydrogen for use in fuel cells, for example.

But cars and other vehicles still predominantly rely on liquid fuels.

With this in mind, researchers have designed a bionic leaf that not only uses solar energy to produce oxygen and hydrogen, it feeds this hydrogen to bacteria that is then engineered to make isopropanol.

Researchers have designed a leaf that uses solar energy to produce oxygen and hydrogen. This hydrogen is fed to a bacterium called Ralstonia eutropha. An enzyme takes the hydrogen back to protons and electrons and combines them with carbon dioxide. This is then engineered to make isopropanol (illustrated)

Isopropanol is an alcohol molecule that can be used as fuel, similar to ethanol or gasoline, and can be separated from water using salt.

The technology was created by a team from Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Medical School and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University.

It builds on the work of Professor of Energy Daniel Nocera and his ‘artificial leaf’ first demonstrated in 2011.

Professor Nocera’s ‘leaf’ was made from a silicon strip coated with catalysts on each side.

The Harvard leaf produces oxygen and hydrogen in the same way as Professor Nocera’s, but the hydrogen is then channeled through a chamber filled with a bacterium called Ralstonia eutropha. 

An enzyme in this bacteria takes the hydrogen back to protons and electrons, and these are combined with carbon dioxide within the same chamber. 

The researchers then extract this bacteria, with the protons, electrons and carbon dioxide and metabolically engineers it to make isopropanol.

This engineering method was discovered by Anthony Sinskey, professor of microbiology and of health sciences and technology at MIT. 

Professor Nocera’s ‘leaf’ was made from a silicon strip coated with catalysts on each side.

When placed in water and exposed to sunlight, the strip split the water molecules to release and oxygen and hydrogen.

‘This is a proof of concept that you can have a way of harvesting solar energy and storing it in the form of a liquid fuel,’ said researcher Pamela Silver.

‘[Professor Nocera’s] formidable discovery of the catalyst really set this off, and we had a mission of wanting to interface some kinds of organisms with the harvesting of solar energy.

‘It was a perfect match.’

‘The advantage of interfacing the inorganic catalyst with biology is you have an unprecedented platform for chemical synthesis that you don't have with inorganic catalysts alone,’ said Brendan Colón, a graduate student in systems biology and co-author of the paper.

The same principles could be used to produce drugs such as vitamins  (stock image shown)

‘Solar-to-chemical production is the heart of this paper, and so far we've been using plants for that, but we are using the unprecedented ability of biology to make lots of compounds.’

The same principles could be used to produce drugs such as vitamins in small amounts, Pamela Silver said.

And in theory, any carbon-based liquid fuel could be engineered from the process.

The team said its immediate challenge is to increase the bionic leaf's ability to turn solar energy to biomass by optimising the catalyst and the bacteria.

Their goal is 5 per cent efficiency, compared to nature's rate of 1 per cent efficiency for photosynthesis to turn sunlight into biomass.

‘We're almost at a 1 per cent efficiency rate of converting sunlight into isopropanol,’ Professor Nocera said.

‘There have been 2.6 billion years of evolution, and [Professor Silver] and I working together a year and a half have already achieved the efficiency of photosynthesis.’

The findings are published in the journal PNAS and co-authors include Joseph Torella, and Christopher Gagliardi.
