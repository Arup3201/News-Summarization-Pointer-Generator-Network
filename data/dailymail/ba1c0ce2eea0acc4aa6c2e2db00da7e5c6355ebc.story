Accrington Stanley have appointed John Coleman as the club's new manager for a second time.

The 51-year-old was at the helm between 1999 and 2012, during which time he took the Lancashire club from the Northern Premier League First Division to the Football League following a 44-year absence.

Coleman and assistant Jimmy Bell, who both moved on to Rochdale in 2012, have left their roles with League of Ireland Premier Division side Sligo Rovers to return to Accrington on rolling contracts.

Stanley had been without a manager since former England striker James Beattie left by mutual consent last week.

'We hope this is going to be an exciting time for the players, staff and supporters,' Coleman told the club's official website.

'It's certainly an exciting time for me and Jimmy. We've never really stopped supporting the club since we left, we've seen a lot of games and we can't wait to work with this group of players.

'It's no secret that I've wanted to manage in the Football League again and when a job comes up at a club as close to your heart as Accrington then that ticks two boxes.'

Club chairman Peter Marsden said: 'John and Jimmy's passion,enthusiasm and knowledge of the game are legendary.'

Coleman inherits a side 20th in  League Two having lost five of their first eight games.
