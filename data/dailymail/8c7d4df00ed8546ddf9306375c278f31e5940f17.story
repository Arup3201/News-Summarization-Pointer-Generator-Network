Tens of thousands of middle class parents are being sent letters ordering them to repay hundreds of pounds of child benefit - even though many have already returned the cash.

The letters, which say ‘You need to act now!’, have been sent to 30,000 families where one earner receives more than £50,000 a year.

Since January last year, families with someone earning between £50,000 and £60,000 a year lost a proportion of the child benefit. Where one parent earned more £60,000 a year, the child benefit was lost altogether.

Chancellor George Osborne cut child benefit for any family where one parent earned more than £50,000

The letters cover a three month period last year after the benefit was cut. A family with one child would owe £263 and £438 if they had two children.

Parents  had to opt out of receiving the benefit - or fill in a self-assessment form if they were still entitled to some of the cash.

Around a million parents were hit by the benefit cut. But the Government has sent letters to around 30,000 who it believes have yet to pay back the cash.

A HMRC spokesman said: ‘Those who have paid the tax charge due need not be concerned and can simply disregard the letter.

Tory MP Christopher Chope said the benefit cut for middle class families was a 'nightmare'

‘The letter reminds taxpayers to include the charge on future tax returns and we would encourage couples to discuss between themselves which partner might be eligible for the charge.

‘If that is not possible, we can provide guidance to allay any concerns about who is to pay the charge.’

But Tory MPs, speaking to the Telegraph newspaper, said the letters were ‘disproportionate’.

Christopher Chope, a senior Conservative MP, said: ‘The nightmare of this new tax on families who want to do the right thing is far from over. 

'We knew it was going to be an administrative nightmare – and so it has proved.’

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Our tax and benefit system has become so complex that even HMRC can't make head nor tail of it.

‘The taxman got 5.5 million bills wrong last year. Until both our tax and benefit systems are radically simplified, mistakes will continue to be made and ordinary people will feel the pain.’ 

The tax office HMRC has previously faced criticism for its use of blanket mail outs.

In May, letters were sent to savers asking them to explain why their rate of tax was ‘lower than the average for people with a similar amount of income to you’.

HMRC admitted sending 1,000 letters to customers with an income of more than £150,000.

Proposals to hand the taxman the power to raid the bank accounts has also faced intense criticism, with critics pointing to HMRC’s track record of errors over the past decade.
