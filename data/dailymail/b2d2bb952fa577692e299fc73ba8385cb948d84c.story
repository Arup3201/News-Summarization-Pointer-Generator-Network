It went to the tune of Black Lace's cheesy 80s pop tune Agadoo and proclaimed that Anderson, in not too polite terms, was better than Cesc Fabregas.

Now, with the Brazilian on his way home and the Spaniard primed for the latest chapter of a glittering career at Chelsea, it defies logic.

But back in 2007, when United fans belted out their latest terrace hit, they had reason to believe what they were singing was true.

This was an exciting signing. Along with Nani, Sir Alex Ferguson appeared to have secured the services of two of Europe's hottest properties and Anderson announced his arrival in November of that year against Fabregas' Arsenal at the Emirates.

The Gunners' playmaker may have scored but in an electric 75 minutes on the field the new boy was everywhere.

Immediately the home crowd took a dislike. Always a good sign. Demanding yellow cards but playing with a smile on his face and a seemingly supreme confidence the new Brazil international seemed set to become a long-time adversary.

In February of the following year he was at it again in a thumping 4-0 victory which knocked Arsenal out of the FA Cup at Old Trafford and he would go on to lift the Champions League trophy, scoring a penalty against Chelsea after coming on in the 120th minute to help turn Moscow red.

So how did he go from Stretford End icon to a man famed more for his appetite off the field than on it? From a £20m 19-year-old tto a misshaped misfit he club could barely give away?

In that second clash with Arsenal, Anderson again did not last the pace, this time withdrawn on 72 minutes.

The fitness issues were there from the start. At Porto he broke his leg in 2006. That luck followed him to these shores. At United he suffered a cruciate injury in 2010 and his knee went the following year.

Both meant long periods on the sideline. Was motivation a factor? It may well have been. When the second injury struck he was still only 22 but had already achieved so much.

Rumours that he had developed a taste for fast food abounded. In Manchester, with its abundance of restaurants and Curry Mile, he was not short of options.

The joke even found its way inside the club. Patrice Evra was spotted telling Rio Ferdinand he brought him his burger at one o'clock.

At Carrington, they would ask where he was. 'Ando's at Nando's' was often the tongue-in-cheek remark.

But it would be remiss and cruel to claim he got injured, got fat and that was that.

Even when available there is an argument that he was never allowed to fully express himself.

Perhaps Sir Alex Ferguson, whose brother and scout Martin famously described Anderson as 'better than Rooney' was guilty of trying to make him into a player he was not.

Often he was cast in a holding role, a victim of his own versatility and a club well stocked with creative talent.

When Ferguson went, the end appeared to be nigh. A loan spell at Fiorentina failed to yeild a permanent move to Italy. Moyes went but under Louis van Gaal he played only 90 minutes in THAT Capital One Cup thrashing at MK Dons and 20 in the 0-0 draw with Burnley.

Anderson played just one full 90 minutes for Van Gaal and it came in the defeat to MK Dons in the cup

Both of those appearances were in August and things hit a new low when it emerged that despite United alerting others to his availability nobody came forward with an offer.

Eventually it was Internacionale, in his homeland, who offered an escape route.

Even in what would turn out to be Anderson's final match in a red shirt, glimpses of that talent remained.

Picking up the ball in the Liverpool half during an Under 21s match at Leigh Sports Village last month, he spotted Nick Powell's run and dinked a lovely ball over the top of an unsuspecting defence.

It was a brilliant and yet disappointing moment and left you feeling you were seeing a talent wasted.

If nothing else, it was a somberly fitting end.

On leaving United, the midfielder took to Instagram to say goodbye.

'Thank you so much to Manchester United It is truly the best club in the world, I love it so much and have enjoyed every year I have spent there,' he wrote.

'Thank you to all the team who work at United and especially all the boys, I have made some amazing friends, all of whom are great players and will continue to do great things.

'And one massive thank you to all of the fans, for your continuos love.. The best.' [sic]
