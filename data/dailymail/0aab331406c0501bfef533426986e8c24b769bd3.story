Its hull astonishingly intact, a First World War German U-boat lies embedded in remote mudflats up an English creek.While more than 40 of the deadly submarines met their fate in our waters during the conflict, this is the only one that can be seen.

The wreckage of the others lies hidden deep beneath the sea.

The existence of this one has long been known, but its eerie presence has gained fresh interest after tidal changes and the recent storms made it more visible.

New research by naval historians for 
English Heritage has shed fresh light on how the undersea war machine 
came to be marooned on the banks of the Medway in Hoo, Kent, and the 
mystery of why it has lain there untouched for more than nine decades. 
Their investigations also led them to conclude that, after many years of
 uncertainty about its identity, it is almost certainly a submarine 
called UB-122.

Yesterday 
marine archaeologist Mark Dunkley, the maritime designation adviser for 
English Heritage, said: ‘It has been there since 1921. It was one of 
more than 100 U-boats which surrendered at the end of the war and were 
taken to Harwich.

‘Some were sent to the French navy but most were cut up and used as scrap metal.

‘Records
 show that the diesel engines were cut out of UB-122 and reused in a 
cement works at Halling in Kent – the U-boat’s power plants thus 
serviced Britain’s post-war industrial development.

‘What
 we still don’t know is exactly why or how UB-122 ended where it is. 
It’s likely it was being taken up the Medway estuary to be broken up for
 scrap. Perhaps in a storm it parted from its tow, the cable snapped, 
and the prevailing winds blew it to Hoo.

‘As
 to why it was left there, we can only speculate. It could have been too
 much of an effort to get to it, or perhaps it was a problem of 
navigation in how to get to it.

‘Its interest is that it is the only known complete U-boat that can be seen in British tidal waters.’

UB-122
 was a ‘coastal’ U-boat equipped with ten torpedoes and designed to 
attack Allied shipping. The other main use of U-boats was for laying 
mines.

There are no current 
plans to conserve it, but English Heritage is ‘looking to identify its 
historic place in more detail’ after the end of next year’s 
commemorations associated with the centenary of the start of the 1914 to
 1918 war.

Mr Dunkley said: ‘It still serves as a poignant reminder of those who gave their lives at sea during the First World War.’

The submarine is thought to be a UB-I22 submarine and would have carried 10 torpedoes and were usually armed with a deck gun

They carried a crew of 34 and had a cruising range of 7,200-9,000 miles. Between 1916 and 1918, 96 were built

The U-boat skippers would target British vessels

On 5th September 1914, the U-boat SM U 21, which was considered unpromising initially, sank the British light cruiser HMS Pathfinder.

In February 1915 the sea around the British isles were declared a war zone by Germany and the battle of the U-boats began.

A neutral flag offered no protection against the ruthless U-boat captains, who were ordered to be absolutely sure a ship was neutral before sparing it.

Submarines did not have a hopeful start in their history. The first submarine built in Germany was called the Brandtaucher, which sank during its first test dive.

But bigger and more successful submarines were developed, and equipped with deadly weapons which made them a crucial addition to Germany's arsenal of weapons.

At the start of World War I, Germany had twenty-nine U-boats; in the first ten weeks, five British cruisers had been lost to them.

On 5 September 1914, HMS Pathfinder was sunk by SM U-21, the first ship to have been sunk by a submarine using a self-propelled torpedo.

U-boats caused so much destruction that at one point during World War Two the British government thought that Britain would have to contemplate surrendering.

Following the end of World War One, Germany was technically not allowed to have submarines or submarine crews - but continued to invest money, time and man power into building more as they prepared for World War Two.

It is the only German submarine visible in UK waters today and is a visible reminder of the Great War

After the war the German UB-122 was initially stripped of its internal metal engines to be used for scrap metal
