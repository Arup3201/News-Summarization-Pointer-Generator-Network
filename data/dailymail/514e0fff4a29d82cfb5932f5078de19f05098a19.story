Roberto Soldado has warned his Tottenham team-mates they face another 12 finals just days after suffering Wembley heartache as the striker wishes team-mate Erik Lamela a happy birthday.

Tottenham saw the dream of winning their first silverware in seven years crushed by Chelsea on Sunday as Jose Mourinho's side handed them a 2-0 defeat in the Capital One Cup final.

Mauricio Pochettino's side were also dumped out the Europa League by Fiorentina three days before the League Cup disappointment leaving an assault on the Premier League top four their only ambition for the rest of the season.

Former Valencia forward Soldado has, in typically cliched fashion, slammed home the importance of the remaining 12 league fixtures, starting with the White Hart Lane clash with Swansea on Wednesday night.

'It only remains to look ahead and to be focus on the Premier League,' the out-of-favour striker tweeted on Tuesday. '12 matches, 12 finals. We need to be in the top 4.COYS!!'

Meanwhile, Lamela was celebrating his birthday on Wednesday and Soldado took to social media to wish his team-mate many happy returns ahead of the match against Garry Monk's side.

'Happy birthday @Coco_Lamela!! I hope tonight you have the best gift,' he tweeted along with a picture of the pair.

Tottenham go into Wednesday night's game in seventh place six points behind Manchester United in fourth, but having played a game less.

Swansea are one place behind in eighth and can close the gap on Spurs to just a single point if they can take advantage of recent struggles for the north London club.

Tottenham have failed to win any of their last five games since beating Arsenal 2-1 back at the start of February. Swansea, in contrast, have recorded back-to-back wins to keep alive the hope of securing Europa League football next season.
