Unhappy: Andrew Mitchell with the bike at the centre of the Plebgate affair

A diplomatic protection officer and a middle-aged woman were arrested yesterday over the alleged ‘Plebgate’ plot to discredit former Tory Minister Andrew Mitchell.

In all, six people – four police and two others – have been detained by Operation Alice detectives investigating claims that a conspiracy cost the former Chief Whip his job.

Mr Mitchell was forced to resign after allegations he was aggressive towards officers and called them ‘plebs’ when they would not let him take his bicycle through the main Downing Street gate in September.

But a Channel 4 investigation cast 
doubt on the police account. Among other things it revealed that CCTV 
footage disproved the claim that a large group of tourists were outside 
the gate during the row.

Scotland
Yard said the 48-year-old policeman arrested yesterday is being 
questioned on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The woman, aged 
49, is suspected of assisting an offender. Both were held following 
‘fresh information’ given to Operation Alice officers on June 4.

David
Davis MP, a friend of Mr Mitchell, wrote to the Independent Police 
Complaints Commission on that day highlighting evidence which ‘strongly 
reinforces the case that a conspiracy took place’.

In his letter to the IPCC, Mr Davis 
referred to documents lodged by The Sun newspaper in defence of a libel 
action taken against them by Mr Mitchell.

In
them, the paper refers to a call it received the morning after the 
incident from an anonymous woman who described herself as a tourist. She
was said to have overheard Mitchell saying to police officers: ‘You’re 
f****** morons – you think you run the country, well you don’t.’

But Mr Davis pointed out to the IPCC that video evidence showed ‘there were no civilian witnesses in earshot of any exchange’.

He added: ‘The only possible explanation therefore is that this bogus witness was yet another police officer masquerading as a civilian, or a civilian put up to it by one of the police officers who was aware of the original incident.’

Last night Mr Davis said: ‘All I was doing was what you would expect any decent policeman to do. Looking at the facts with a cool forensic eye.’

The arrested policeman had previously been issued with a Regulation 15 notice, served following an alleged breach of professional standards. He has been on restricted duties but will now be suspended.

Mischief: Crispin Blunt MP suggested mischievously that broadcaster Channel 4 should be put in charge of the investigation

In a further development, The Mail on Sunday has learned that detectives have followed the advice of another Tory minister and turned to Channel 4 for help.

Last week Crispin Blunt MP stood up in the Commons and suggested mischievously that the broadcaster should be put in charge of the investigation. He said: ‘The Channel 4 Dispatches programme took 10 days to establish that the video record was completely at odds with the police account of events.

‘Since the police have interviewed 800 officers, spent £144,000 and taken eight months apparently to go nowhere, might it be an idea to invite Channel 4’s Dispatches to be put in charge of the investigation, as it appears more effective and would certainly be more independent?’

Two days after Mr Blunt’s comments Detective Superintendent Steve Williams wrote to Channel 4’s political editor Michael Crick requesting emails and communications with Keith Wallis, 52, the officer Channel 4 first contacted six months ago.

Mr Wallis, from Ruislip, Middlesex, was arrested in January on suspicion of misconduct in public office.

Revealed: Dispatches and Channel 4 News revealed CCTV footage contradicted claims that onlookers had been shocked by the incident as it showed just one, uninterested, man walking past

Under investigation: The CCTV footage showed an exchange that raised questions about the description in police logs leaked to the media

The letter said the Met had sent a report to the Crown Prosecution Service but wished to identify all lines of enquiry. It also asked for communications with any of Wallis’s associates. Channel 4 is understood to be considering how to respond.

The events date from September 19, 2012, when police on duty in Downing Street refused to open the gate for Andrew Mitchell to leave by bike. According to a police log leaked to the media later, Mr Mitchell is said to have told the police to ‘learn your f****** place’; that they didn’t ‘run this f****** government’, and that they were ‘f****** plebs’.

But in December Dispatches and Channel 4 News revealed CCTV footage that contradicted the account in the leaked logs. Reports said the log mentioned eyewitnesses who were ‘visibly shocked’. But the footage shows just one man wandering past, who didn’t appear to show particular interest in the incident.

The Dispatches programme also revealed an email was sent from a man in Ruislip to his MP John Randall – who coincidentally was and still is deputy chief whip – with an account very similar to the police log published in the media.

Denial: While Mr Mitchell apologised for using profanity, he has always denied calling the officers 'plebs' and 'morons', or telling them to 'know their place'

Friends of Mr Mitchell said last night that Scotland Yard had many questions to answer about the case. ‘If it has taken eight months to turn to such an obvious line of inquiry it must be clear to everyone that the Met is dragging its heels,’ said one.

While Mr Mitchell apologised for using profanity, he has always denied calling the officers ‘plebs’ and ‘morons’, or telling them to ‘know their place’.

Operation Alice was launched in December to investigate whether there was a conspiracy to frame Mr Mitchell. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, originally stood by his officers, saying they had ‘accurately reported what happened’.

But he was later forced to promise that he would preside over a ‘ruthless search for the truth’ about the ‘Plebgate’ confrontation that led to Mr Mitchell’s resignation.
