Gregory John O'Brien, 21, has been arrested for pointing his gun at students and firing it in the air during a dispute between rival fraternities 

A 21-year-old college student who allegedly fired his gun in the air during a dispute between two fraternity houses has been arrested. 

Gregory John O'Brien was on the balcony of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, where he is a member, at the University of Georgia when he pointed his .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol at members of the neighboring Pi Kappa Alpha, according to police.

O'Brien then 'raised the gun' and fired one shot into the air before pointing it once more at the Pi Kappa Alpha members, cops say.

The two fraternities, located on the college's on-campus Greek Park Circle, had been involved in an altercation a half-hour before the shooting, police told The Augusta Chronicle. 

O'Brien was one of the members involved in the argument, which occurred over the weekend, authorities believe. 

Less than an hour later, several Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity members stood in-between the two houses. 

Members of Tau Kappa Epsilon were standing on their balcony.

The fraternity members retreated into their respective houses after O'Brien allegedly fired the shot. 

O'Brien has been charged with aggravated assault, possession of a weapon on school grounds and reckless conduct. 

The student surrendered at the Clarke County Jail on Monday and was released after posting a $10,000 bond. 

O'Brien was identified as the shooter after police interviewed witnesses and seized the pistol from the Tau Kappa Epsilon house, police say.
