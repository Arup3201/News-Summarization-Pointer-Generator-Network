Critics and fans alike loved Breaking Bad during its hit run on AMC and the show's finale on Sunday didn't disappoint.

A popular show's final episode has become a cultural touchstone and a point of debate with hits such as The Sopranos, Dexter and Seinfeld raising eyebrows with their controversial endings.

The 75-minute final episode of Breaking Bad was written and directed by show creator Vince Gilligan and it somehow managed to live up to the hype.

Final episode: Bryan Cranston's Walter White character wrapped up loose ends on Sunday in the series finale of Breaking Bad before succumbing to a gunshot wound

The New York Times weighed in and called it a 'fitting ending, and predictable in only some ways.'

Reviewer Alessandra Stanley added: 'So many shows, notably The Sopranos and Lost, have gone dark without anything approaching 
finality. Here, the writers were so determined to not leave unfinished 
business that the last episode was called 'Felina,' an anagram of 
finale.'

The review noted that the only question that remained to be answered was why Bryan Cranston's Walter White character became such an over-qualified chemistry teacher in the first place.

Variety said the show's finale 'perfectly capped a final arc that was all forward momentum, with barely an ounce of fat on it, and almost nary a false note.'

Violent end: Walter went back to New Mexico to confront foes and make amends

Brian Lowry added: 'From the first frame to the last on a
 series that absolutely belongs in the conversation of the best ever, 
Vince Gilligan knew what he was doing.

'There was a lot of closure in Breaking Bad. You can say that Gilligan gave most of the viewers what they wanted (and, impressively, he did that by staying true to himself and the story without selling out or becoming unrecognizably saccharine as he tied the bow).'Tim Goodman, Hollywood Reporter

'Perhaps the best thing about the finale of Breaking Bad is that it actually ended. So many shows, notably The Sopranos and Lost, have gone dark without anything approaching finality. Here, the writers were so determined to not leave unfinished business that the last episode was called 'Felina,' an anagram of finale. And almost every loose end was tied. In some cases, a little too tightly, and in others, not quite as much.'Alessandra Stanley, New York Times------------------------------------------------------------

'In what may be the first recorded (and distinctly over-tweeted) perfect finale in television history, AMC's Breaking Bad came to a close Sunday night. Not only did Vince Gilligan's five-season, hyper-violent prose poem to midlife male frustration tie up virtually every loose end in sight, it contained the Holy Grail of all storytelling: an Actual Moment of Truth.'Mary McNamara, Los Angeles Times------------------------------------------------------------

'From the first frame to the last on a series that absolutely belongs in the conversation of the best ever, Vince Gilligan knew what he was doing. The plan wasn’t always evident — indeed, Breaking Bad consistently wrote itself into corners with no apparent exit, before devising an ingenious one — but as Sunday’s finale made eminently clear, this was a show whose narrative fearlessness was only matched by its boundless creativity and unpredictability.'Brian Lowry, Variety------------------------------------------------------------

'Tense, witty, violent, oddly tender and, in its own strange way, as close to a 'happy' ending as a story this dark could hope, this last episode brought the story to a straightforward, definitive conclusion, without the spirituality of Lost or the ambiguity of Sopranos.'Robert Bianco, USA Today

'The plan wasn’t always evident - 
indeed, Breaking Bad consistently wrote itself into corners with no 
apparent exit, before devising an ingenious one - but as Sunday’s finale
 made eminently clear, this was a show whose narrative fearlessness was 
only matched by its boundless creativity and unpredictability.'

USA Today wrote that a 'lesser show' 
would have seen Walter go off on a revenge-fueled rampage in the finale,
 but Gilligan ended the show instead on a creative high note.

'Which is just how it began, and just what it deserved,' USA Today wrote.

Los Angeles Times' Mary McNamara concurred: 'Not only did Vince Gilligan's 
five-season, hyper-violent prose poem to midlife male frustration tie up
 virtually every loose end in sight, it contained the Holy Grail of all 
storytelling: an Actual Moment of Truth.'

And
 Hollywood Reporter's Tim Goodman added that he was thrilled the finale 
was not too 'saccharine' as the much-loved show drew to a close.

He wrote: 'There was a lot of closure in 
'Breaking Bad'. You can say that Gilligan gave most of the viewers what 
they wanted (and, impressively, he did that by staying true to himself 
and the story without selling out or becoming unrecognizably saccharine 
as he tied the bow).'

Any 
questions viewers may have had about the characters and storyline were 
undoubtedly answered by the finale episode, wrote Time's James
 Poniewozik, adding: 'The last episode ever of the magnificent series 
Breaking Bad, was a kind of machine gun of narrative, knocking down all 
of those questions with auto-fire efficiency.

''Felina'
 was - as effective, satisfying series finales are - true. It was true 
to the five seasons that preceded it, true to Walter White’s obsessions 
and pride, and true to what Breaking Bad is at heart: a Western.'

And
 Washington Post's Hank Stuever concluded that the finale was the 
perfect ending to a show which never failed to delight viewers.

He
 wrote: 'There just isn’t a weak season of Breaking Bad. There’s just 
superior work, a sprint toward evil that turned into a marathon.'

But it wasn't only critics who were quick to comment on the finale episode, as several Hollywood heavyweights took to Twitter
 to mourn the end of the AMC drama, which (spoiler alert) didn't end 
well for teacher turned meth manufacturer, Walter White.

Ellen
 DeGeneres tweeted: '#BreakingBad ends tonight. No more murderous drug 
dealers and horrifying criminals. I miss it already.'

Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky wrote: 'Almost like losing a good friend. congrats to @BreakingBad_AMC a historic run.'

And Emmy Rossum wasn't ready to let go, writing: 
'#GoodbyeBreakingBad is breaking my heart. I'm not ready for this. I 
binge watched over the summer & I'm not ready for it to be over!'

Intense showdown: Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman considered shooting his former chemistry teacher Mr. White

Survivor: Jesse was rescued by Walt from the neo-Nazis

Comedian
Dax Shepard tweeted: '#60minutes #homeland and #breakingbadfinale all 
in one night!!! My DVR is involved in a major orgy.'

Jimmy Fallon was very impressed: 'Tight! Tight! Tight! #BreakingBadFinale.'

Kathy
Najimy joked: 'all the @BreakingBad_AMC watchers can now watch me on my
patio every sunday 9-10p instead .I promise i'll B cooking up something
fun & blue.'

Ewan McGregor was depressed, saying: 'Breaking Bad. Ends Tonight. #gotthebluesalready.'

Oprah's
bestie, Gayle King wrote: 'The final scene Walter white is dead and 
JESSE is free charlierose and I agree finale satisfying!'

Selfless act: Walt was shot as he saved Jesse from gunfire

Paul
 Feig wrote: 'Spoiler alert! The series finale of #BreakingBad was 
effin' awesome. This show has never been anything less that fantastic. 
Congrats to all.'

The series has been breaking records 
since it returned with the final half of its fifth season in August, 
nearly doubling its viewership from the premiere of the first half of 
the season last year.

Just
 1.2 million people tuned in to the 2008 premiere compared to the 
penultimate episode which was watched by 6.6 million viewers.

Sunday night's audience figures have yet to be released.

Devastated: Emmy Rossum is heartbroken that Breaking Bad has reached its end

Depressed: Ewan McGregor is sad the epic series is over after five seasons

Funny: Dax Shephard was happy with the night's viewing options

Cranston,
 Gilligan and co-star Aaron Paul, who portrayed chemistry student turned
 methamphetamine manufacturer Jesse Pinkman, got together for a video to
 say goodbye and talk about the finale.

'Out of everybody, I think I'm the most emotionally stressed,' Paul said.

'It's rough. Breaking Bad has been life changing for me and it's such a family,' Paul said.

Breaking Bad earlier this year was named by the Writers Guild of America as the 13th best-written television series of all time.
