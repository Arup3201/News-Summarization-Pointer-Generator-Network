West Ham have announced record pre-tax profits of £10.3million following a successful year both on and off the pitch.

The east London outfit have put their success down to finishing 13th in the Premier League, progressing to the semi-final of the Capital One Cup and the agreed sale of the Boleyn Ground as some of the main factors.

West Ham's profit is particularly significant as the Premier League club announced a before tax loss of £3.5m last year.

The Hammers agreed to sell Upton Park earlier this year ahead of their move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016

Joint chairman David Sullivan announced in his end of year financial statement that he is 'satisfied' with his side's performance over the course of 2014.

Sullivan wrote: 'My board and I are satisfied with the achievements we have in the 2013-2014 season.

'At the start of the season we bought Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing, and took a number of players on loan during the January window, investing a total of £32.9m.

'Later in the year, my co-chairman David Gold invested a further £3.5m to allow the manager to go into the transfer market to cover our injury crisis.

'We have further invested in the playing staff for the 2014-15 season with the significant investment into the purchases of Mauro Zarate, Diego Poyet, Enner Valencia, Aaron Cresswell, Cheikou Kouyate, Diafra Sakho and Morgan Amalfitano.

'This season will bring its own challenges, but we continue to believe we will deliver both on and off the pitch by investing in the team, the brand and managing the business well.'

Vice chairman Karren Brady, who is the driving force behind the club's move to the Olympic Stadium, echoed Sullivan's sentiments: 'Through the hard work of a fantastic, dedicated, loyal and determined team both on and off the pitch the club has grown in size, revenue and in stature this season.

'The management team off the pitch were able to capitalise and maximise on all the opportunities the manager and the team delivered on the pitch.'

The Hammers are currently sixth in the Premier League, having won nine of their 19 league games so far this season.
