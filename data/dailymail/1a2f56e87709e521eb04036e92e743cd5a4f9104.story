A Scottish hotel has been named as one of the most 'jaw-dropping' places in the world to stay.

Atholl Palace in Pitlochry, Perthshire, features on a list of 28 unique hotels 'to stay at before you die'.

It is ranked alongside a volcano-like lodge in Chile, underwater rooms off the coast of Zanzibar and cottages perched on the limestone cliffs of Negril in Jamaica, in the article by South Africa-based tourism website TravelGround.

3. Panchoran Retreat, Bali 

4. Hotel Ristorante Grotta Palazzese, Italy

5. Montana Magica Lodge, Chile

6. Burj Al Arab, Dubai

7. Museumotel, France

8. Whitepod Hotel, Switzerland

9. The Caves Resort, Jamaica

10. Attrap Reves Hotel, France 

The four-star hotel, which is placed at number 22, is the only hotel in the UK and Ireland to make it on to the list and it is noted for its turret suites, manor house rooms and formal gardens. 

Anthony Kelly, spokesman for Castle Collection of Hotels, which includes Atholl Palace, said: 'TravelGround has a massive global following and we are absolutely thrilled that Atholl Palace has been recognised amongst the most jaw-dropping hotels in the world.

'To be the only hotel in the UK and Ireland included in this exclusive ranking makes the accolade all the more prestigious, not just for the hotel but also for Scotland as a world-class destination.' 

Top of the list is The Manta Resort in Zanzibar. The hotel describes itself as 'probably as far away from civilisation as you’ll ever get.

The main attraction is the Underwater Room, where guests can enjoy the wonderful marine life swimming up to their window.

The three-floor suite floats within a thriving coral reef and boasts a submerged master bedroom surrounded by windows to view the sealife.

Located on the tropical Pemba Island in Zanzibar, the top two floors of the Underwater Room rest above the surface of the water, while the bedroom sits four meters beneath the surface.

Besides a double bed to lie on, the room features two large windows on each wall, giving an almost total 360-degree view of the ocean surrounding it.

As you can probably guess, the half-submerged hotel suite isn't cheap. Spending one night in the Underwater Room costs £1,000 for two people. 

Number two on the top 28 places list list is the Hotel Kakslauttanen in Finland.

Each igloo, which can cost up to £240 a night, is fitted with beds for two people, a bathroom, and - best of all - a personal sauna.

Also onsite is the world's biggest snow restaurant, where tables are made of ice, and the world's largest smoke sauna.

Showers are available in separate buildings, with separate facilities for men and women. A spokesman for the resort said: 'From inside the glass igloos, you can admire the Northern Lights and the twinkling of the bright, starry sky with your loved one.

The Panchoran Retreat in Dubai and (right) Hotel Ristorante Grotta Palazzese In Italy both make it on to the list

'The best part is that it's all from the comforting warmth of room temperature.' 

And sneaking into the top three is the Panchoran Retreat in Bali.

Designed by interior designer Linda Garland the venue is characterised by its fantasy villas, sparkling waterfalls and sumptuous organic gardens, with sustainability in mind, using both the bamboo that grows wild in the area as well as old telephone poles purchased from the local government.

Writing on the resort's website, Garland, who has lived in Bali since the 1970s says: 'We have seven houses, a yoga pavilion, a 'Big Bale' where everyone meets and a large country kitchen, a world of its own. 

'Apart from the private pools in the houses, there is a 26 meter lap pool filled with spring water. You can relax on the bamboo bridge perched over the river. We have little hideaway Bales where you can do yoga, have your massage, read, relax or even have a nap.'
