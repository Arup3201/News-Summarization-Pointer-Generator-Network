Surprise: Officer Gene Kimpton from North Texas responded to a 911 call at the Carrollton home and thought it was going to be a burglary but, in fact, it was a baby

A police officer helped a woman who did not know she was pregnant deliver her baby after she called 911 because she went into labour.

North Texas officer Gene Kimpton was responding to an emergency call earlier this week inside the Carrollton home.

He had drawn his gun before approaching the house because he thought it was going to be a burglary.

‘I totally did not expect to be delivering a baby,’ he told Nbcdfw.com.

When he entered the home in the 1700 block of Pleasant Run Drive he found a young child in the living room.

He
asked the boy where his mother was, and the child pointed to the 
bathroom where Kimpton found a woman on the bathroom floor in the 
process of giving birth.

When she had called 911, she had simply told the operator, ‘Help me, please.’

With the help of a Spanish translator, 
she requested an ambulance. But she did not know what was wrong, and she
didn't know she was pregnant.

The woman told the 911 translator that she was having liver problems and that doctors had given her medication.

The baby was also a shock to the woman's husband, who arrived home shortly after his wife and newborn were taken by ambulance to Baylor Medical Center.

‘I told him, "Congratulations, you're a dad of a little boy",' Kimpton said. ‘He was stunned. He had no idea this was coming.’

Kimpton had never delivered a baby before, but his police training had taught him to deal with cuts and wounds and instincts kicked in for the father of two.

‘I realised what was happening, and I had to act. I had to help the baby out,’ he said. ‘Once we got the baby out, he was crying. We wrapped the baby in a towel, and I held it until the paramedics got there.’

Despite the surprise birth, the baby is healthy, police say. He and his mother were resting comfortably at the hospital Thursday.

The family declined to comment, saying it would like to remain private.
