His dialogue is renowned for his extended pauses, yet even by the standards of Harold Pinter, 15 years is a long wait.

But now two new plays by the writer – who died in 2008 aged 78 – are being unveiled in the first premieres of his work since 2000.

The announcement by Radio 4 of the productions is sure to cause great excitement in the literary world – and also among fans of Game Of Thrones star Rose Leslie, who has been cast in one of the new works.

The productions also feature Last Tango In Halifax’s Anne Reid and Hollywood actor Mark Strong.

Two new plays by Harold Pinter – who died in 2008 aged 78 – are being unveiled in the first premieres of his work since 2000.

The radio dramas are based on Pinter’s adaptations for the screen of Joseph Conrad’s 1915 novel Victory and his screenplay for Karen Blixen’s short story of love and loss, The Dreaming Child.

Pinter found fame as a playwright in the 1950s. He established himself as one of Britain’s most prolific screenwriters and is perhaps best known for his collaborations with maverick director Joseph Losey in the films The Servant and The Go-Between.

The new scripts form the centrepiece of Radio 4’s Unmade Movies series.

BBC drama commissioner Jeremy Howe says: ‘It isn’t often that you can announce the premiere of a script by the late great Harold Pinter, one of the leading dramatists of the 20th Century, and then two come along, both wonderfully Pinteresque and both utterly different in tone. This will be a treat for listeners.’

Mark Strong will star in Victory, alongside narrator Simon Russell Beale and Bjarne Henriksen, the Danish actor who played the grieving father in the first series of TV’s The Killing. Conrad’s novel is a tragic tale of love, deceit and murder in the Dutch East Indies.

Henriksen will play Axel Heyst, whose life spirals out of control when he comes to the rescue of a female musician molested by a local hotel owner.

Strong, whose film credits include Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, will play the murderous Ricardo, sent to punish Heyst for his intervention.

When Pinter completed the screenplay for Victory in 1982, he was riding high on the success of the French Lieutenant’s Woman which starred Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep.

But the film never materialised because of financial problems.

Pinter’s adaptation of The Dreaming Child is set in Bristol in 1868 and tells the story of childless couple Emily and Tom Carter and their decision to adopt a boy from the slums. But happiness eludes the couple because Emily continues to be haunted by her passionate fling with a young soldier who was killed at sea.

It will be narrated by Anne Reid, who plays Celia in the Bafta-winning Last Tango In Halifax, and stars Rose Leslie.

Pinter was originally commissioned to write the screenplay by Hollywood star Julia Ormond, who at the time had signed a production deal with 20th Century Fox. 

She was delighted with Pinter’s work but the project collapsed when she insisted on directing the film as well as producing it.

Pinter later commented: ‘It was this that brought the project to its knees. The money-men simply wouldn’t give her the chance.’

In his official biography of the playwright, critic Michael Billington said the screenplay for The Dreaming Child compared favourably with Pinter’s very best work.

The new adaptation of Victory will launch the series of Unmade Movies when it is broadcast next Saturday, February 28, at 2.15 pm on Radio 4.
