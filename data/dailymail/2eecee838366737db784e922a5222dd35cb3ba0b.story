Iran is criticizing the U.S. and specifically the Obama administration for its 'racist' treatment of minorities.

A statement released Sunday by Iran's Foreign Ministry calls for action to end the country's 'racist, inhumane crackdown on blacks' in the wake of the controversial grand jury decisions not to indict police in the deaths of both the Eric Garner and Michael Brown.

Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Marziyeh Afkham told the press America has to 'stop police brutality and racist and inhumane treatment of minorities and colored populations in the country.'

The deaths of Garner and Brown and the perceived failure of authorities to fairly seek justice has sparked protests and outrage nationwide.   

Free Beacon notes that Iran ironically is at the forefront of executing both children and political dissidents.

'It is expected from the U.S. administration and judiciary to comply with their duty and take lawful and just actions in dealing with their citizens and stop the practice of racism and inhumane behavior,' Afkham continued. 

Iran news organization FNA reported that the spokeswoman further demanded that 'U.S. administration [must] show respect for human rights and set aside its politically-tainted view on the issue.

'The U.S. administration has continuously criticized other countries and made an instrumental use of human rights and adopted double-standard criteria in the last few decades, while it has ignored domestic situation at home.'

Far from having a moral high ground, it should be noted that Iran continually outrages human rights activists by reportedly torturing prisoners in cruel and unusual ways, setting them on fire or cutting off limbs.
