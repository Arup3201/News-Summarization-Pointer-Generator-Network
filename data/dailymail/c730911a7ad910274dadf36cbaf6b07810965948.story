Philippe Coutinho is laughing at the bone-juddering memory. His command of English is limited but he understands the question perfectly.

With the help of universal sign language — a fist crashing against a hand — Coutinho is being taken back to his introduction to the rough and tumble of English football, when he realised artistic midfielders are not afforded the same time and space as on the continent.

Standing next to Coutinho in an interview room at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground, you cannot help but wonder how he survives. He is 22 but his boyish face and diminutive frame make you think he is not long out of school.

Philippe Coutinho left Brazil at the age of 18 to pursue a career in European football

Silk, rather than steel, is a quality that you would associate with this young man from Rio de Janeiro.

Looks, though, are deceptive. Daniel Sturridge may have given Coutinho the nickname ‘David Blaine’ for his magical abilities but those talents would not be on show without inner steel. Coutinho left home at 18 to chase his dream with Inter Milan. He had to contend with homesickness and constant upheaval at the San Siro and, given the circumstances, it would have been easy to shirk the challenge. But nothing was going to get in the way of his ambitions — especially not a few heavy tackles.

‘My parents stayed with me in Italy for a while, that helped at first,’ says Coutinho. ‘But then they went home and it was hard. When they left you start to appreciate how big a step it is leaving behind everything that you know.

‘My home was a simple place, near a few favelas. The famous Favela da Mangueira was close by. I never had any problems in childhood, my father (Jose Carlos) worked hard to give me and my brothers (Cristiano and Leandro) every opportunity.

‘My dad has always been passionate about football. But it was one of my friends’ grandmother who told my father to get me into the soccer school. She said I had talent. I signed for Inter when I was 16 but moved when I was 18. You miss your family and friends but you have to deal with it. I have been away four years now and I still miss them. My ambition was to succeed and you have to get on with life.’

Perhaps a family reunion at Christmas is one of the reasons Coutinho has started to spark back into life again; his family and the family of his wife, Aine, stayed with him for the festive period, meaning 18 people were squeezed into his home in Liverpool’s leafy suburbs.They returned to Brazil on Thursday but any sadness at their departure has been balanced by Liverpool’s schedule; on Tuesday, after all, there is the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea and a reunion with the man who helped entice him to Europe.

Brendan Rodgers pounced to sign Coutinho from Inter Milan for £8.5million in January 2013

Coutinho was surprised at the physicality of the English game and was helped to adapt by Rodgers

Jose Mourinho was in charge at the San Siro in 2008 when Inter struck a deal with Vasco da Gama for Coutinho; he would have liked the opportunity to work with Mourinho but his successor at Inter, Rafa Benitez — a man Liverpool fans hold close to their heart — played a key role in helping him settle. ‘I trained with Inter for two days when I went to sign,’ Coutinho reveals.

‘I met Mourinho and had a couple of conversations with him. He was helpful because it was someone who spoke Portuguese. I never got the chance to work with him as he left in the summer I joined. By then, Rafa Benitez had come in. He was very helpful. Training was good but I didn’t play well at Inter. I didn’t have confidence.’

Sent to Espanyol on loan, where he regained belief under Mauricio Pochettino, he has thrived since Rodgers signed him two years ago.

Having missed the World Cup, he is now a regular in Brazil’s squad and Rodgers has been important to his development. ‘He has helped a lot,’ Coutinho agrees. ‘He gave me time to adapt. The physicality takes you by surprise. When you put your head up in England, you see two or three players ready to hit you.

Coutinho has thrived at Liverpool and scored some big goals, including this one against Manchester City

The Brazilian feels his Liverpool team are improving of late after a slow start to the season

‘The intensity, the speed is what really takes time to adjust. You can never relax for a minute in one game. In Brazil, Italy and Spain you have time and space to play the ball.’

Movement and control, technique and vision, Coutinho has all the attributes The Kop associates with its leading men and when a new era dawns without Steven Gerrard the onus will be on the 22-year-old to step forward and show why Rodgers thinks so highly of him.

Coutinho is one of a number of players who Liverpool want to secure on long-term contracts and the idea of committing for a lengthy period appeals; what appeals even more, however, is the prospect of winning some silverware.

The 22-year-old says he would be happy to stay at Liverpool for a long time and wants to win trophies

‘The start to the season was slow but we are improving and results have been much better over the last few weeks,’ he said. ‘If we could win a trophy that would be very important for the team and the club.

‘The major difference is the (3-4-3) system we are now playing. We have more options in each position. We press high, we are creating more opportunities and we have intensity again. We have our confidence back.

‘It is not a hot topic for me about signing a new contract. But I would be very happy to stay here for a long time and, maybe, I could become like one of the great players who have been here. I want to win trophies here of my own.’
