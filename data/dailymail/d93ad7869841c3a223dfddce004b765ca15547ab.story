A land and sea search will resume at first light tomorrow for an English yachtsman and his Australian companion after the wreckage of their yacht was found on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

The two men had earlier sent messages to family members on a satellite phone telling them they were in trouble as their yacht had run aground and was breaking up in fierce seas.

Rescuers are hoping that the men, who are both in their 60s, had managed to scramble ashore on a deserted island, which is part of the Tonga group in the Pacific.

Crisis: A search was on to find an English sailor and his Australian companion after their yacht the Navillus, seen here before the trip, broke up in the Pacific Ocean

Hope: The Navillus ran aground in fierce seas on a remote island and the men were able to send an SOS to family members

The names of the yachtsman have yet to be released by authorities in Tonga, New Zealand and Australia, who are co-ordinating search and rescue efforts.

But rescuers have confirmed that the men managed to contact relatives on their satellite phone as their 50ft yacht Navillus broke up around them.

According to yachting records, the vessel has four cabins and was built in 2008. It was previously offered for hire form a Swedish charter company.

The two men were reported last night to have boarded the Navillus in the Caribbean and were sailing it across the Pacific Ocean to Bundaberg in Queensland, Australia, when it ran into trouble.

They phoned at least one relative, living in Victoria, Australia, to say that they had run aground and needed help.

Shortly afterwards, an emergency locator beacon was activated off the Tongan island of Late.

Searchers on boats found wreckage of the yacht on coral near Late island, but there was no sign of the men.

A Royal New Zealand Air Force Orion aircraft was due to reach Tonga at midnight and would help in the search at first light tomorrow.

Search co-ordinator Geoff Lunt said from New Zealand that the crew of two local fishing boats had reported finding wreckage floating near the smashed hull.

'They have located the hull of the vessel and seen a lot of debris,'said Mr Lunt.

'The yacht's dinghy has been found and an un-deployed liferaft, as well as a number of life jackets.'

Local officials said there were several potential landing points on the island close to where the hull was found and it was possible the Englishman and his companion had managed to scramble ashore and taken shelter.

A crew from one of the rescue boats had gone ashore, but darkness made searching for the men impossible and it was decided to continue the rescue operation at first light.

Asked what the survival time would be if the men were still in the water - and if they were wearing lifejackets - Mr Lunt said it would be at least 36 hours.
