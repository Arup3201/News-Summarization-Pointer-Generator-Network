Captain Cobb's departure from Grace Road follows those of all-rounder Shiv Thakor and seamer Nathan Buck in recent weeks.

Northants chief executive David Smith said: 'Josh will bring a real cutting edge to our white-ball cricket, having already scored five hundreds in this format.

The 24-year-old batsman has scored five one-day hundreds this season alongside a decent championshp

'He has also had a very good championship season this year and brings invaluable captaincy experience ... at 24 years of age, his best cricket is still ahead of him.

'He was the number one target of first-team coach David Ripley, and we are absolutely delighted he is joining the club.'

Cobb added: 'I feel it's now time to start a new chapter and challenge myself to improve in a new environment.

Young seamer Nathan Buck has also left Leicestershire in recent weeks, joining division one Lancashire

'I want to wish Leicestershire all the best for the future. Grace Road will always be a special place for me.

'Northamptonshire have proven that they are a winning limited-overs team and have set clear targets to get back into (LV=) Division One next year.

'I want to be a part of this - and after talking to the management ... I'm convinced it's the right place for me to achieve my goals.'
