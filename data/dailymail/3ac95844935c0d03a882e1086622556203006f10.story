All eyes were on an emotional Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands as she signed over her throne to her eldest son Willem-Alexander this morning.

But the real star of the show was the Duchess of Cornwall who cut a glamorous yet unassuming figure by the side of her husband, the Prince of Wales.

While she dazzled last night in a flowing floor-length evening gown, she today opted for a more simple, yet nonetheless stylish look as she attended the inauguration ceremony for King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands.

Glamorous: Camilla showed off her glamorous side today in a chic pale blue dress with dazzling peal accessories

The 66-year-old donned a chic pale powder blue dress by one of her go-to designers Bruce Oldfield, which she teamed with an array of dazzling accessories.

Her blonde hair was layered and voluminous and she wore an intricate feathered headpiece by Philip Treacy to match her dress.

The standout piece of her outfit was most certainly her pearl necklace - a Parker Bowles family heirloom- which she teamed with matching pearl earrings, a look she has made her signature style.

While it is not unusual to see royal males wearing a cabinet-full of medals, Camilla was also sporting a vast array of regalia.

On her left shoulder was her Family Order, a portrait of the Queen as a young woman set in diamonds and suspended from a ribbon.

George IV started the formal practice of presenting Family Orders and the practice has been continued by his successors.

Each sovereign commissions a unique portrait of themselves which is suspended on a different coloured ribbon - George V used white, George VI favoured rose pink while the Queen's is chartreuse yellow.

The Orders are now worn on formal occasions by female members of the Royal Family only, although more than one Order can be worn at the same time. For example, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother wore the Orders of both The Queen and George VI.

Lady in blue: Queen Maxima looked stunning during the investiture ceremony with her husband

The Queen awarded her daughter-in-law
 her highest personal honour last year to mark her seventh wedding 
anniversary to Prince Charles.

The Order was founded in April 1896 
by Queen Victoria and honours are in the Queen's personal gift, 
independent of Downing Street. They are given by the head of state to 
people who have served her or the monarchy in a personal way.

As a Grand Dame Cross Camilla boasts 
the letters GCVO after her name (as do several other senior female 
royals including Princess Anne, the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess 
of Gloucester).

Announcing the news last year palace 
sources told the Mail that the award recognised the Duchess's hard work 
as a member of the monarchy.

A glamorous affair: Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary arrived

At a time when most women her age 
would be looking forward to a slower pace of life, she now carries out 
hundreds of royal engagements each year.

Camilla has also taken on a wide range of patronages and travelled extensively overseas with the prince on official visits.

Of course Charles was no slack in the
 style stakes today either, wearing the Admiral of the Fleet Full 
Ceremonial Uniform with sword, medals and the Cross of the Order of the 
Crown (the Cross of the Order of the Crown is awarded by the Dutch 
Sovereign for service to the Dutch Royal Household).

Queen Maxima also upped the glamour 
stakes in an eye-catching electric blue gown and matching floor-length 
draped coat as she stood by her husband, King Willem-Alexander during 
their investiture ceremony at Nieuwe Kerk or New Church in Amsterdam.

Camilla really shone in the style stakes
 last night when she and Charles joined Queen Beatrix Of The Netherlands
 as she hosted a Gala Dinner ahead of her abdication.

Camilla, 66, looked young beyond her years in a sweeping floor-length gown and dazzling tiara.

Donning
 a stylish Bruce Oldfield dress and diamond headpiece, Camilla stood by 
her husband's side at the dinner with members of the Dutch royal family at Amsterdam's Rijksmuseu.

Signature headwear: The Duchess of Cornwall wore a similar headpiece to the wedding of her son as well as to her own wedding to Prince Charles

Dazzling: Camilla, the dazzling duchess wowed onlookers as she turned out to celebrate the crowning of King Willem-Alexander of Holland as Queen Bea steps down

Her hair was voluminous in layers and the Boucheron honeycomb tiara she wore was loaned to her by the Queen.

Often worn by the Queen Mother, the dazzling item comprised diamonds set in platinum and gave her outfit a dazzling edge.

Camilla has been an unlikely source of 
fashion and beauty advice for the Duchess of Cambridge.

After advising Kate on who to see for 
facials, Camilla, suggested that she had her hair coloured by 
her top stylist Jo Hansford.

When Kate was considering wearing 
flowers in her hair on her wedding day, Camilla intervened and suggested
 a tiara was more appropriate.

And judging by Camilla's style credentials both today and last night, it really seems that she is taking her own advice.

Camilla and Charles joined Prince Felipe and Princess Letizia of Spain and Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik and his wife.

This morning, an emotional Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands signed over her throne to her eldest son Willem-Alexander as thousands poured on to the streets of Amsterdam to welcome their first king in more than 100 years.

The 46-year-old gripped his mother's hand after they both put their signatures on the abdication document  at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.

millions more watched on national television

The 75-year-old looked close to tears as she then appeared on a balcony overlooking some 20,000 of her subjects.

'I am happy and grateful to introduce to you your new king, Willem-Alexander,' she told the cheering crowd.

Moments
 later, in a striking symbol of the generational shift, she left the 
balcony and the new king, his wife and three daughters - the children in
 matching yellow dresses and headbands - waved to the crowd.

'Dear
 mother, today you relinquished the throne. 33 years moving and 
inspiring years. We are intensely, intensely grateful to you,' the new 
king said.

With her abdication, she becomes Princess Beatrix and her son ascends the throne as King Willem-Alexander.

The
father of three's wife becomes Queen Maxima and 
their eldest daughter, Catharina-Amalia, becomes Princess Orange and 
first in line to the throne.

Willem-Alexander, a 46-year-old water 
management specialist, is expected to bring a less formal touch to the 
monarchy together with his wife, a former investment banker from 
Argentina.

He has pledged to be a 21st century king, close to his 
nearly 17 million subjects, and not a 'protocol fetishist'.

Wearing
a sober purple dress, Beatrix signed the abdication document in front 
of the Dutch cabinet, Willem-Alexander and Maxima, who wore a pale 
rose-coloured dress with a shimmery skirt and enormous bow on her left 
shoulder.

'Today, I make way for a new generation,' said Beatrix.

On what is a national holiday in Amsterdam - known as Queen's Day (likely to now become known as King's Day) Queen Beatrix handed over reign of Holland to her son, Prince Willem-Alexander Of Orange. 

He is said to be a jolly man with a great sense of humour.

He has proved himself militarily - only stepping down yesterday from his role in order to take over from his mother.

Shown great interest in affairs of the state.

Very happily married to Queen Maxima since 2002.

The pair met in 1999 in Sevilla, Spain, during the Seville Spring Fair.

In an interview, they explained that he introduced himself only as Alexander because he didn't want her to know he was a Prince, she later found out the truth and thought he was joking.

The couple have three daughters: Princess Catharina-Amalia, 10, Princess Alexia, 8, and Princess Ariane, 6.
