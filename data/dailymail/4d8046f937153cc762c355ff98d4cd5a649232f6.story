For busy New Yorkers, Saturdays off work are sacred, and a time to enjoy leisurely activities.

This Saturday was no different for Chelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky, whom she married in 2010.

The couple looked casual as they took a stroll in Manhattan’s Madison Square Park, a far cry from earlier this week, when she attended her father’s Global Initiative conference.

Day of leisure: Ms Clinton traded her flip flops for trainers and headed for a workout

Ms Clinton, wearing workout gear and flip flops, strolled arm in arm with her husband around Madison Square Park in the Flatiron District.

Leading the pack was the couple’s Yorkshire terrier Soren, which was given to Ms Clinton as a gift from her husband.

Later, the 32-year-old hit the gym, wearing a muted outfit and neon trainers. And in the evening, Ms Clinton had a packed agenda.

She wrote on Twitter Saturday night that she and Mr Mezvinsky were attending the Global Citizen Festival in Central Park, where the Black Keys, The Foo Fighters, Neil Young, and Crazy Horse performed.

Dubbed the Global Citizen Festival, the concert also featured K'naan, John Legend and Band of Horses, with Young's performance capping off the evening.

Old New York: People flocked to the landmark New York park to watch the festival

Video of the event was streamed worldwide as about 60,000 music fans crowded the park's Great Lawn, the midtown Manhattan skyline twinkling behind them.

Legend made a surprise appearance, playing one song, Imagine, at a piano on stage, a short walk from where the song's author, John Lennon, once lived.

The five-hour show was a mix of tight sets from the bands, roughly an hour each, mixed with videos and information from guest speakers about global poverty-related problems like infant mortality and polio.

Public life: Ms Clinton read Amazing Grace and The Gingerbread Boy at the Brooklyn Public Library on Thursday

Only last month, the former first 
daughter spoke about her marriage to Vogue, telling the magazine that 
she would not rule out running for office herself, following in the 
footsteps of her father, former president Bill Clinton, and her mother 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is Secretary of State.

She said that after her wedding to Mezvinsky in 2010, she realised she had two choices – ignore the fame, or use it ‘to highlight causes that I really cared about.’

Clinton married her long-time boyfriend in an elegant ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York, in the Hudson Valley.

The then-bride was notoriously secretive about her wedding plans, only revealing the date ahead of her nuptials.

The blonde has been expanding her horizons in a number of ways. Last year, she became a special correspondent for the Brian Williams news show Rock Center.

Of her television career, she said: ‘Historically, I deliberately tried to lead a private life in the public eye, and now I am trying to lead a purposefully public life.’
