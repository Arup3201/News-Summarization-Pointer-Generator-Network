A driver had a dramatic escape after he became trapped in his vehicle when a trailer of hay bales flew off the back of an overturned tractor.

The 56-year-old man was driving a silver 4x4, which was struck by falling bales then shunted into a nearby house after the trailed shed its load in Royston, Hertfordshire, on Friday afternoon.

The trailer, which was being pulled by a tractor, fell as it was going around a tight corner near the Chequers pub on the A10 in the centre of the town, which lies 15 miles south of Cambridge.

The car driver was freed by passers-by who desperately clawed away the hay and was not injured in the accident at 1.45pm, but the road was left covered with hay and blocked for several hours.

East of England Ambulance Service spokesman Gary Sanderson said: ‘A man who was driving past in a car was struck by falling bales of hay, trapping him against a house.

‘Amazingly he managed to free himself with the help of members of the public before our arrival. This man was very fortunate indeed to walk away without injury.’

The A10 
was closed between Royston and nearby Buntingford for more than two 
hours.

A spokesman for Hertfordshire 
Constabulary said on Friday: 'The road is entirely blocked and it will 
be a lengthy clean up operation. The bales of straw are strewn all over 
the road.'

The accident caused structural damage to one house, but the owner of the tractor was unharmed.
