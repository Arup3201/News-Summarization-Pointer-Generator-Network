Cristiano Ronaldo will have the usual queue of rivals wanting to swap shirts with him after Saturday's game against Cordoba, even if it costs them 50 euros for the privilege.

Cordoba's Romanian striker Florin Andone has revealed every time one of the players at the cash-strapped club gives away a shirt at the end of a game they have to pay 50 euros for it because they can't afford to keep giving players new jerseys.

Andone fell foul of Cordoba's rule earlier in the season when he swapped with Luis Suarez. He says: 'I said to Suarez: 'Can I have your shirt?' He said to me: 'Of course you can but I want yours in return'. It made me proud to think he wanted my shirt. I knew I would have to pay 50 euros to replace it but on this occasion I didn't mind.

Cristiano Ronaldo won't be short of Cordoba players lining up for his shirt but will they cough up the cash?

Real Madrid are the richest club in the world and have an endless supply of shirts for the Ballon d'Or winner

'I would like to have a Madrid shirt after Saturday's game. Everyone will want to swap with Ronaldo and I would love to be the one he exchanges with him but if not then I don't mind who I swap with be it [Alvaro] Arbeloa or Nacho.

Real Madrid and Barcelona players have a never ending supply of shirts throughout a season but players from smaller clubs in Spain are issued with a limited number and must reimburse the club if they go beyond the limit. 

If Andone fails to secure Ronaldo's jersey he will settle for one from Alvaro Arbeloa (left) or Nacho (right)

There will be no problem tomorrow if Ronaldo is happy to give his shirt without getting one in exchange but if he wants a swap as Suarez did then Andone will have to cough up again.

Suarez has form for making sure he gets a shirt back from anyone he gives one to. 

In his autobiography Crossing the Line he says: 'I asked a referee for his shirt once. He'd asked for mine, via one of the club officials, and I said: 'Okay... he can have one of mine if I can have one of his.' He never sent me it. That was a pity. I would like to have had a referee's shirt to wear on my day off.'
