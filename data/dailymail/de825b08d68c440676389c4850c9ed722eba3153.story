Fifa chiefs awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar despite being told it had the highest risk of terrorist attack of any of the bidding countries, it was reported today.

A devastating report into the security situation in the Gulf state found there was a 'high risk' of terror plots due to al-Qaeda's presence in nearby countries, it is claimed.

It is believed world football's governing body handed the 2022 tournament to the Arab nation despite other countries being assessed as having a 'low to moderate risk', in a process which has since been dogged by allegations of corruption.

A planned stadium for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, which is allegedly at 'high risk' of terrorist attack, it emerged today

Qatar went
 up against Australia, Japan, South Korea and the US as bidding 
countries to host the tournament in a process which began in 2009 and 
ended in 2010, when the Middle Eastern state was awarded the World Cup.

In
 a series of explosive revelations in recent weeks, the Sunday Times has
 reported that leaked emails cast grave doubts on the fairness of the bidding process.

The
 newspaper today claimed that a report by Andre Pruis, the man in charge
 of security at the 2010 World Cup, found 'it would be very 
difficult to deal with a major incident in such an environment [as 
Qatar] without having to cancel the event'.

Despite
 Mr Pruis praising the security credentials of the other bidding 
countries, Qatar was later awarded the tournament at a lavish 
ceremony.

It
 was also alleged today that the man brought in to investigate alleged collusion in 
the bidding process was 'poached' by Qatar, where he was later 
installed at a multi-million pound security centre.

Australian investigator Chris Eaton left Fifa in April 2012 after travelling to Qatar to look into allegations of corruption.

It was claimed today he was later given a job as chief investigator at the newly-formed International Centre for Sport Security in the Arab state.

Mr
 Eaton's lawyers have insisted there was 'nothing improper whatsoever' 
about his appointment to the body and there 'no prospect whatsoever' of 
his being appointed to the role when he resigned.

But the claims will add to the growing calls for the process to be reopened, potentially allowing countries like England to bid again.

The
 latest revelations come after accusations disgraced Fifa 
vice-president, Mohamed Bin Hammam, bought support for 
the Qatar's bid by making payments to football officials from 
Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.

He has also been accused of organising major gas deals to secure key votes.

But Qatar's
 2022 bid committee have said Mr Bin Hammam played 'no official or unofficial role' in efforts to 
secure the competition and denied all wrongdoing.

The
 Sunday Times today reported that a series of high-profile players, 
including Argentinian legend Diego Maradona, former France star Eric 
Cantona and Brazil's Romario have condemned Fifa over the allegations.
