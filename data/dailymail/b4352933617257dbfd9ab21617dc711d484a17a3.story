Travelling Chelsea fans won't find it too hard to pick out their heroes in action next season.

Jose Mourinho's side have released their new away kit, an all-yellow tribute to the west London club's history.

Until the recent darker efforts, yellow Chelsea away kits were the norm in a tradition dating back to the 1960s.

Stamford Bridge legends like Peter Osgood and Charlie Cooke frequently donned yellow on the fabled FA Cup winning-side of 1970s travels.

The colour also cropped up on the 1980s pinstriped kits of Pat Nevin and Kerry Dixon, while younger fans will remember 1990s stars like Gianfranco Zola and Dennis Wise in yellow kits.

The move back to yellow will be popular with the club's fanbase, in the last decade only treated to the colour in the kit worn in the 2009 cup final and a controversial flourescent kit in 2007.

The kit should also make Chelsea's host of Brazilian stars feel right at home. Midfielders Oscar, Willian and Ramires, as well as David Luiz - all in Luis Felipe Scolari's World Cup squad - give the Stamford Bridge squad a decidedly 'samba' feel.
