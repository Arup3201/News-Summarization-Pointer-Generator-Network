You would think with any meticulously planned theft operation, the culprits would always be prepared to face a confrontation.

But these six raiders fled empty-handed from a motorbike showroom after tough staff fought them off with relative ease.

CCTV footage from the In-Moto showroom in Croydon, south London, shows two raiders, wearing motorbike helmets, walk into the shop and try to wheel away two £25,000 red Ducati Panigale motorbikes.

But when one of the workers at the showroom, Paul Read, discovered what they were doing, he grabbed the men, hauled the bikes back into the showroom and shoved the raiders out of the door - as well as two other thugs who had joined them.

The footage from inside the showroom shows the two raiders picking which bikes to steal.

Then Mr Read, 35, is shown grappling with the thugs and sending them on their way by kicking them out of the door.

And outside the showroom more raiders turn up - only to be confronted by the In-Moto manager Adrian Couzens and his team at around 5.30pm last Tuesday.

The footage captures Mr Couzens charging at a thug and knocking him off his moped outside the showroom and fending off another thug armed with a pair of bolt cutters.

Mr Couzens is joined by Mr Read, Mr Read’s 17-year-old son Tay and two workers from a nearby garage - who combine forces to send the six raiders racing off empty handed.

Tay today said the staff at the superbike showroom stopped the raiders from wheeling away two new Ducati Panigale motorbikes - which can do 0-60mph in three seconds.

He said: 'They didn’t know what they were messing with when they tried to steal from us.

'They came in armed with iron bars, hammers and bolt cutters, but my dad fought off four of them in the showroom and Adrian and the rest fought them off outside the showroom.'

At one point in the CCTV, one of the thugs chases a mechanic with an iron bar and Paul Read is hit on the shoulder by a bolt cutter after a thug hurled it at him just seconds before the gang fled.

Tay Read added: 'These guys knew what they were doing - or at least they thought they did, but they got more then they bargained for on this occasion.'

Local Simon Brooks, 35, said: 'These scum tried to walk off with two superbikes which would take people years to save for.

'They got a taste of their own medicine though and crawled back into the hole they live in when they couldn’t deal with a bunch of guys simply doing their job.'

Police are appealing for witnesses.
