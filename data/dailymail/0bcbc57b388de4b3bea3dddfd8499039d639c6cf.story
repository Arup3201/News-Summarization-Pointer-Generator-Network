A quarter of Britons have had an affair according to a study which reveals that most people are not satisfied with their sex life.

One in four people admit to being unfaithful at one time in their lives and a fifth of those surveyed have felt tempted to cheat in their current or past relationships.

Nearly one in three men and more than one in five women claim to have had more than ten sexual partners.

But the majority are still not satisfied, with less than half enjoying a rewarding sex life and a 
quarter saying they were left unfulfilled.

The
 figures were released by the charity Relate in a report called The Way 
We Are Now which documents the state of the UK's relationships in 2014.

Four years ago a similar report found that one in three people admitted to having been unfaithful.

‘Changes in attitudes towards separation and divorce may mean that it’s now easier to leave an unhappy relationship rather than be unfaithful,' the report says.

Meanwhile less than half of those who took part in the survey claimed to enjoy a rewarding sex life and a quarter said they were left unfulfilled.

But nearly 60 per cent said they had never had an affair and had not even been tempted to do so, the report adds.

And only a third of those asked believed a relationship could survive an affair.

Relate researchers found that the number of sexual partners peaked among those aged between 35 and 44 with more than 20 per cent reporting they had bedded 20 or more people.

At the other end of the scale, the report adds, nearly one in ten reported that they had never had a sexual partner with a fifth only ever having slept with one person.

The report says: 'When it comes to our sex lives, it seems that we’re a nation divided – around half of those surveyed are fairly or very satisfied with their sex lives but for a significant minority, experience falls short of expectations. 

'Despite – or perhaps, because of – the wealth of information available about sex on the internet, in magazines and on TV, our survey found that many people don’t know where to go to get practical advice or who to talk to about problems in their sex life.'
