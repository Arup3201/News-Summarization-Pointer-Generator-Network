Kris Commons has told Celtic he is ready to start talks over a deal which would tie him to Parkhead for the rest of his career. 

Newly-promoted Leicester City are keen on the 30-year-old, the Scottish Football Writers’ Player of the Year last season. 

But Commons, who scored 32 goals as the SPFL champions streaked to a third straight title last term, says he wants to end his career in Glasgow playing for Celtic.

Entering the final year of his contract, the former Scotland international can talk to other clubs from January.

Keen to secure his future as quickly as possible, however, Commons said ahead of Tuesday night’s Champions League qualifying first leg with KR Reykavik: ‘The manager and (chief executive) Peter Lawwell are aware of my contract situation and hopefully, sooner rather than later, we’ll sit down and talk about it. 

‘When you get four or five months into the last year of your contract, you can start talking to other clubs.

James Forrest is out of Celtic's Champions League second-round qualifier against KR Reykjavik in Iceland on Tuesday night.

The Hoops' winger will miss the first leg with a groin injury while skipper Scott Brown had previously been ruled out for at least a couple of months with a hamstring injury.

Charlie Mulgrew will skipper the Scottish champions in the absence of Brown.

Provisional squad: Forster, Lustig, Matthews, Mulgrew, Van Dijk, Ambrose, Izaguirre, Griffiths, Kayal, Commons, Pukki, Stokes, Johansen, Henderson, O'Connell, Zaluska, Gordon.

‘But that’s something I don’t want to do, I want to get my future sorted here. 

‘I’d rather get it sorted in the next couple of days, if it was up to me. 

‘I hope we’ll get it done soon. I didn’t have a bad year last year so I hope they still want me. 

‘I have absolutely no desire to go back to England. For me, I’m playing the peak years of my career at one of the biggest clubs in the world.

‘If we’ve got Champions League football, there’s no better place to be than Celtic. If we can also win the title, some cups, and getting into Europe again, we’ll keep progressing.

‘I’d like to finish my career at Celtic 
because there’s no need to go anywhere else. There’s nothing down the 
road that would entertain me. 

Gearing up: Manager Ronny Deila and Commons talk to the media ahead of Tuesday night's qualifier

‘I love playing for this club in front of the passionate fans who drive us on every week.

‘There aren’t many clubs down south where I could go and play in the Champions League. Celtic provides me with that. 

‘Hopefully I’ll do enough in the next couple of games to ensure we get to where we need to be.’
