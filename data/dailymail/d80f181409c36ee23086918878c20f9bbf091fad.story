One Kanye West fan has been left broken-hearted after the singer called him out for buying a fake pair of his Air Yeezy sneaker designs on Monday in Paris.

The fan had approached Mr West to sign the shoes outside of a café where he had been lunching with Kim Kardashian. Never one to exercise subtlety, Mr West said of the sneakers: ‘These are not real though, you know that, right?’

The fan, who had likely paid hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, for the rare sneakers couldn’t believe it, saying: ‘Are you serious?’

Mr West, 36, graciously responded, ‘These are not real, it’s fine though,’ and signed them regardless.

‘Damn, broke my heart,’ the duped fan said as Mr West loaded into a car with the help of a security entourage, where fiancé Ms Kardashian was waiting.

While the fan’s identity remains unknown, a video of their interaction was posted to Instagram by a female French Kimye fan named Dodo, whose account appears to be something of a dedicated fan page to the couple.

Mr West began designing Air Yeezys in 
collaboration with Nike in 2007. He spent two years working on 
development with the brand before officially releasing the style in 
2009.

But before they came out, Mr West created buzz for the style by debuting them on stage at the 2008 Grammy Awards during his performance of Stronger and Hey Mama.

The $215 sneakers, named for Mr West’s ‘Yeezy’ nickname, sold out almost immediately, and those who missed out on the shoes in stores have been known to shell out up to $10,000 for a pair on reselling sites like eBay - creating an opportune environment for counterfeiters.

The popular style is formatted as a high-top basketball sneaker, comprised of contrasting grains and textures of leather. They have a wide strap across the top of the foot, and are known for utilizing contrast colorways like white, cream and red or black, cream and lime green.

Mr West’s Nike partnership spawned a follow-up edition called the Air Yeezy II, which was released in 2012. The style is less athletic looking and chunkier than the first Yeezy edition.

A surprise Air Yeezy II colorway called The Red Octobers was released this past February to mass fan hysteria.

Prior to the Air Yeezy, Mr West had designed sneakers in collaboration with Louis Vuitton and Pharrell Williams’s line BAPE.
