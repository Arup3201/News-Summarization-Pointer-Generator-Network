Gabriel was forced off with a hamstring injury after just 36 minutes during Arsenal's 2-1 victory at QPR on Wednesday night, and Arsene Wenger admitted the defender could be out for three weeks.

The £16m January signing was making his second Premier League start for the Gunners having made his full debut against Everton last weekend, but he went down holding the back of his leg in the first half.

Laurent Koscielny replaced the 24-year-old Brazilian, who is set to miss the crucial FA Cup quarter-final clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford.

'Gabriel had a hamstring problem,' Wenger said after the game at Loftus Road. 'I don't know how bad it is yet, it is usually 21 days.'

The former Villarreal centre back was given a torrid time early on by Bobby Zamora as he got used to the physical nature of the Premier League. 

Wenger added: 'We were nervous in the first half and QPR put a shift in physically. They paid for that in the second half.'

Arsenal sealed the win with goals from Olivier Giroud and Alexis Sanchez, though in-form striker Charlie Austin gave Wenger's side a fright late on.

Koscielny is expected to partner Per Mertesacker as the Gunners travel to play Louis van Gaal's Red Devils on Monday night, looking to reach Wembley for the second successive season.
