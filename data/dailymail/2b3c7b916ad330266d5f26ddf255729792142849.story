A gun fanatic has created a giant mailbox in the shape of a .44 Magnum revolver. 

Roger Buchko, 49, of Lopatcong Township, New Jersey, based the design on his own Smith & Wesson.

He installed the mailbox two weeks ago and since then his mail has been deposited into the muzzle.

Inspiration: Mr Buchko came up with idea after seeing a similar design on the internet and spent a few hours every day for four months putting together the mailbox

Mr Buchko came up with the novel idea after seeing a similar design on the internet and spent a few hours every day for four months putting the mailbox together. 

He said the mailbox is not meant to be a political statement - he just wanted to do a project.

The gun's ammunition cylinder, which revolves on ball bearings, is made 
of wood, as is the grip and the barrel is made from PVC piping.

A semi-retired cabinetmaker, Mr Buchko said so far his work has received a mainly positive reaction.

Meaning: Mr Buchko said the mailbox is not meant to be a political statement - he just enjoyed putting it together

Proud: 'At least 500 people have taken pictures of it already,' Mr Buchko told Lehigh Valley Live

'At least 500 people have taken pictures of it already,' Mr 
Buchko told Lehigh Valley Live. 

'They love it. I haven't had one 
hater yet, except one night somebody threw eggs on it.

Before installing the mailbox Mr  Buchko checked with  postal officials it would be allowed.

'I don't see a problem with it,' said Phillipsburg Postmaster Melody Baylis told the website.

'As long as it accommodates the size of the mail he receives, it's not a problem.'

She said the mailbox is just like other innovative ones around such as cartoon characters.
