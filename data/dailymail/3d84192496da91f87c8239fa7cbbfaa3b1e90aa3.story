A selfless seven-year-old donated his £2.50 pocket money to nine-year-old cancer victim and his sister after raiders stole their birthday money.

Kind Jonah Lewis overheard his parents talking about the cruel break-in at their friends' home.

He went away and found the £2 coin and 50p his parents had given him for sweets and sellotaped them to a card with a message.

Generous seven-year-old Jonah Lewis donated his £2.50 pocket money to the Sonny Nygate, aged nine, and his sister Lois, seven, after their home was targeted by raiders

Selfless Jonah Lewis sellotaped his pocket money to a handwritten note to victims Sony and Lois in which he said 'I am very sorry'

He wrote: 'I am very sorry about the robbery and that you ar upset. Its a horrible thing to steal a child's birthay money because I am sad for you hear is £2.50 in the envelope to replace the birthday money and the money is my sweet money that I didn't spend hoap you be OK, and police will catch the robbers and take them into Jail.'

The money went to cancer victim Sonny Nygate, aged nine, and his sister Lois, seven, whose three bedroom home in Ilford, Essex, worth around £370,000, was burgled on January 25.

Burglars stole birthday money belonging to Sonny, nine and his sister, Lois, seven, during a break-in at their home

The raiders made off with several hundred pounds in cash, which included the children's birthday and Christmas money.

They also grabbed jewellery and watches from the bedroom of parents Lloyd, 42, and Laura and trashed the house.

Jonah heard his parents Monica, 42, and Paul, 44, discussing the burglary and told them he wanted to donate his sweet money.

Proud Monica, from Saffron Walden, Essex, said: 'I saw it on Facebook that friends of ours had been burgled.

'I was talking about it with my husband that night, I just said 'did you hear about it' and we were discussing it.

'I didn't even realise Jonah was listening and at the end he came to us and said 'I don't want to spend my sweet money', which we had given to him a couple of days earlier.

'He hadn't spent it yet, and he said he would like to give it to the family. He said they must be very upset because of what happened.'

Mum-of-one Monica added: 'It was such a lovely thing to do, he is a very kind and generous person.

'Every time we are out and he sees someone on the street he'll always ask us to give them some money, which we do.

'They have been through a lot as well as Sonny suffered from Lymphoma disease, but he is now in remission.

'I think Jonah has a soft spot for him because of that.'

Laura, 40, said she burst into tears when she received the money and card.

The admin worker said: 'After the burglary I was so down, they had wrecked the house, stamped on my wedding tiara and stole money that was for my children.

'I was really really low I had to take a week of work. I received the letter and I was just so overwhelmed that a boy of seven could do something so nice.

'It was just so thoughtful. Our families go back years but he doesn't know my son really well. He probably knows of him more through him being ill.

'It was just such a lovely thing to do, we were all so grateful to him, it restored our faith in humanity.'

Sonny has been in remission from cancer since 2011.

Essex Police are appealing for information about the burglary.

The letter read: 

I am very sorry about the robbery and that you ar upset. Its a horrible thing to steal a child's birthay money because I am sad for you hear is £2.50 in the envelope to replace the birthday money and the money is my sweet money that I didn't spend hoap you be OK, and police will catch the robbers and take them into Jail.
