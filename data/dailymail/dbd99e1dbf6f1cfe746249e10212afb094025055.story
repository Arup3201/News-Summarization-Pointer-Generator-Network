A hairdresser has described the horrifying moment she was hit by a train after climbing onto railway tracks to retrieve a £20 handbag.

Kirsty Owen, 22, was almost sliced apart after being caught by the steps of the fast-moving passenger train as it passed through an empty station at night.

She was the only person on the platform at the time, but her screams of pain were so loud they alerted people living near to the small, un-manned station in Llanfairpwll near Bangor, North Wales.

Terrible injuries: It is believed Kirsty was hit on the backside by the steps of the train leading up to the cabin

Miracle survivor: Kirsty Owen has been left with horrific injuries after being hit by a train while trying to retrieve her handbag from train tracks

Doctors at the specialist trauma unit
at the University of North Staffordshire in Stoke-on-Trent had never seen anyone still alive with such a massive injury.

Kirsty
needed three litres of blood when she arrived at hospital and needed 10
operations. Experts told her she would probably never walk again.

But five weeks after the horrendous accident, she has begun to take her first steps.

Lucky escape: Doctors said they had never seen anyone alive with such a massive injury

And she has decided to speak out to warn others not to make the same mistake of trespassing on train tracks.

'It was a moment of 
madness. I still can’t believe I’m alive - it’s a miracle. It is all a 
blur, I just remember the absolute agony I was in,' she said.

'Blood was squirting from my back right over my head. I felt like I was dying. It was the worst moment of my life.

'I’m still in shock, I’m still so frightened of what could have happened.'

Kirsty, of Llangefni, Anglesey, had spent the night celebrating getting a new job with her friends.

She
had had a few drinks before a friend’s father dropped her at the 
station for the 30-minute train ride home. She was the only person on 
the platform at the time.

She said: 'It was a stupid thing to do, I can’t believe I did something so foolish.

'I was almost sliced in half for the sake of a £20 handbag. Every time I look at my scar I know I had a very lucky escape.

'I’m still having nightmares about it - the last thing at night before I go to sleep is that train coming towards me.'

Her father Paul Owen, 46, said: 'It’s a miracle she is still alive and it’s going to be a long struggle.

Recovery: Doctors had to give Kirsty three litres of blood as soon as she arrived at hospital to keep her alive

Brave: Kirsty, pictured left before the accident, is still recovering in hospital five weeks later

Disaster: The small, un-manned station of Llanfairpwll was empty at the time but nearby residents heard Kirsty's screams

'But she’ll get there, Kirsty is fighting hard to get better. I am so proud of her. She’s got a long way to go but it’s great that she’s on her feet again.'

A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'We cannot overstate just how dangerous trespassing on the railway is.

'Trains can approach quietly and when you do hear an approaching train it can be too late to move out of the way.

'It can take up to the length of 20 football pitches for a train to stop.'
