Comedian Stephen Fry raised eyebrows among audience members at the Baftas last night after apparently imitating scientist Stephen Hawking's electronically synthesised voice.

Professor Hawking - who is known for his good humour as well as his fearsome intelligence - was attending the ceremony at the Royal Opera House in London to present an award.

He made jokes on stage, declaring at one point that he was 'better looking' than host Mr Fry, 57.

However  Mr Fry, who last month married his  partner Elliott Spencer, 27, stunned the audience when he responded to the friendly banter with a joke about Professor Hawking's struggle to speak.

After the prize-winners left the stage, he wrapped up, muttering 'that was really super' in what appeared to be an impression of Professor Hawking's electronic voice.

The scientist, who suffers from motor neurone disease, is so paralysed by the illness that he can speak only with the aid of a computer.

Yesterday's ceremony was the first public outing for Mr Fry and Mr Spencer since they tied the knot.

Eddie Redmayne carried off the leading actor Bafta for his performance as Professor Hawking in The Theory Of Everything.

Redmayne, who has already won a Golden Globe and Screen Actor's Guild award for the role, dedicated this win to three families - his own, his family on the film and the Hawkings ‘for their trust in us, their generosity and their kindness’.

The biopic, based on a memoir by Professor Hawking's first wife, deals with the onset of motor neurone disease which has left him severely disabled.

The Theory Of Everything started the ceremony with a win when David Beckham presented it with the Bafta for outstanding British film.

Its subject also made an appearance when he arrived on stage with another of the film's stars Felicity Jones, before they handed over the Bafta for special visual effects to Interstellar.

But Mr Fry's efforts to be funny were met with disdain by some viewers on Twitter.

London-based singer Clare Burnage said: 'Slightly thrown by Stephen Fry's verbal impression of the amazing Stephen Hawking. Was it bad taste? I rather think so.'

Another Twitter user called Bantonio Banteras said: 'Stephen Fry doing an impression of Stephen Hawking was the most horrifically awkward thing I've ever seen.'

Meanwhile Liam Trenfield tweeted: 'I do like Stephen Fry but that imitation of Stephen Hawking was horrifically awkward, and simply unneeded.'
