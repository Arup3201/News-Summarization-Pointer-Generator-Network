Joe Bennett scored his first goal for Aston Villa as they concluded their pre-season tour of Texas with a win over Houston Dynamo.

The decisive goal came four minutes before the break, left-back Bennett heading home a cross from Andreas Weimann.

Having beaten FC Dallas 2-0 last Wednesday, Villa return to Birmingham from the Lone Star state with a 100 per cent record and there was a piece of silverware too, with this friendly dubbed 'The Charities Cup.'

Paul Lambert and Gabriel Agbonlahor lifted the silverware at the end of a comfortable win that could have seen the Premier League side win by three or four goals.

It took them a little while to settle, with Dynamo captain Brad Davis firing wide after 19 minutes, but thereafter Villa were in the ascendancy.

Fabian Delph dragged a shot wide after 27 minutes after a penetrating run from the heart of midfield, before Bennett headed over a minute later.

Delph picked up a knock, however, and was withdrawn for Kieran Richardson as a precaution just after the half-hour mark.

Karim El Ahmadi came close to giving Villa the lead with a well-struck 25 yard effort that swerved in the air and caused problems for goalkeeper Tyler Deric.

But Lambert's men would not have to wait too much longer for a lead, as Bennett rose highest at the back post to score.

Villa, who made wholesale changes at the break, picked up where they left off after the break, with Darren Bent wasting a couple of decent opportunities.

Alan Hutton jumped to meet an Ashley Westwood free-kick 10 minutes into the second period, but Deric was equal to it.

Off the mark: Bennett's goal was his first for the club and came four minutes before half-time

Chest control: Matthew Lowton brings the ball under control in Villa's victory

Dynamo had their best chance late on when Brian Ownby blazed over from a good position inside the box.

But it was Villa who came closest to having the final say when Gary Gardner struck the post in the dying seconds.

Lambert was pleased with how his side coped in very warm conditions to end their American tour on a high.

'It was hard in this game because of the heat. It's very hard to play in,' he told Aston Villa's official website.

'But I was delighted with them again. It was really, really pleasing in these conditions.

'It was another win - and it round off this mini-tour really well.'

Villa's next friendly is at Chesterfield on Wednesday night, with other fixtures against Groningen, Walsall and Parma to come.
