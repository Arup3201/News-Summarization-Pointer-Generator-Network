Missing: Madeleine McCann vanished from the holiday apartment she was staying in almost five years ago

Scotland Yard’s review of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is on course to cost £2million in its first year.

The team of 30 murder squad detectives has racked up a significant bill since Prime Minister David Cameron called in the force last May.

They have made at least four trips to Portugal and Spain to gather evidence, including a file of leads from private investigators.

The Metropolitan Police has already sent the Home Office a bill for £800,000 but the figure is expected to rise to £1.9million by the end of next month.

The cost includes the salaries of the detectives, translation and interpretation fees, travel expenses and office staff.

Senior figures warned the inquiry, called Operation Grange, could take years to complete and played down any hopes of a significant breakthrough.

When the review was announced it sparked a row over the use of public funds as the Government was accused of interfering with police operations.

Labour peer Lord Harris has said the case raises ‘very big questions’, adding: ‘There is clearly an issue about the resources being used.’

But Kate and Gerry McCann, who personally asked Mr Cameron to intervene, have welcomed the renewed police inquiry.

Madeleine disappeared from her parents’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on the Algarve in Portugal on May 3 2007.

She vanished days before her fourth birthday as her parents dined with friends just a few short distance away.

Since then the case has become one of the most infamous crime mysteries in modern history with hundreds of ‘sightings’ of Madeleine worldwide.

The official police inquiry into her disappearance was shelved in July 2008 but private detectives employed by the McCanns continued the search.

Scotland Yard detectives, led by Detective Chief Inspector John Redwood, have met police and private investigators engaged in the original inquiry.

They have also had reams of paperwork, including statements, police reports and forensic documents, translated.

In December detectives met Spanish colleagues in Barcelona to check on reports that the toddler had been abducted and smuggled across the border.

Private investigators in Spain also handed the Met police team 30 boxes of evidence which they claimed contained up to eight ‘important new leads’.

A spokesman for the McCanns said: ‘They have always been very appreciative of the time and resources that the British police and Home Office have committed to the search for Madeleine and they are grateful that the review is on-going.’
