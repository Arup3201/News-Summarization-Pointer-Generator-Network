Kentucky Senator Rand Paul cautioned on Wednesday that the government's health experts may not be as capable of containing Ebola as they're telling Americans.

'It's a big mistake to downplay and act as if "oh, this is not a big deal, we can control all this." This could get beyond our control,' Paul, who has an MD in optometry from Duke University, told conservative radio host Laura Ingraham.

'I think because of political correctness we’re not really making sound, rational, scientific decisions on this,' he warned.

Paul later claimed, 'we should not underestimate the transmissibility' of the virus, introducing doubt into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's assertions that Ebola can only be passed on through bodily fluids.

Sen. Rand Paul told a conservative radio show host on Wednesday that 'because of political correctness' he thinks the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are trying to 'downplay' the transmissibility of the Ebola virus

Paul's comments came after a Liberian man who had traveled to the U.S. from Liberia on Sept. 20 to visit his family tested positive for Ebola over the weekend.

The man, who has since been quarantined, was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Dallas, Texas, and is now believed to have come in contact with as many as 100 people, including five children, from the time he began showing symptoms to the moment doctors discovered he had Ebola.

That number does not include persons who were on his transnational flights, as he was not yet exhibiting symptoms at the time of travel.

It can take up to 21 days for a person who has contracted the deadly disease to begin showing symptoms, which often include fever, muscle pain, vomiting and bleeding.

Panic has ensued in Texas since details emerged on Wednesday about the 42-year-old man's hospitalization. 

The Ebola patient was revealed on Wednesday to be Thomas Eric Duncan. A neighbor of his family told NBC that when he was helped into an ambulance, Duncan was 'throwing up all over the place.'

Duncan reportedly contracted Ebola while helping family friends take their Ebola-stricken daughter to the hospital in a taxi on Sept. 15 in Monrovia, Liberia. The brother of woman also became infected with Ebola and died a few days later, according to the New York Times.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sought to restore calm to the situation yesterday, explaining that the U.S. has the medical infrastructure to treat Ebola victims, if necessary, in ways that will not 'pose a significant risk to other patients in the hospital, to the doctors and nurses who will be caring for that individual, and certainly doesn’t post a significant risk to the broader community.'

He also attempted to debunk accusations like Paul's. Ebola does not spread as easily as the common cold, he assured reporters. The odds of an Ebola epidemic occurring in the U.S. are 'incredibly low.'

'Ebola is not easily transmitted. It isn’t transmitted through the air like the flu,' the White House spokesman said. 'It is not transmitted through water or food here in the United States. 

'The only way that Ebola can be transmitted is through the bodily fluids of an individual who is already showing symptoms of being sick with Ebola,' he asserted, later noting that 'it is not possible to transmit Ebola through the air. 

'You can't catch it through the air,' he again promised.

Paul, who is a likely 2016 presidential candidate, expressed concern that health officials were glossing over just how contagious the disease is, however, in his radio interview the same day.

'My suspicion is that it's a lot more transmissible than that if people who are taking every precaution are getting it,' the Republican Senator said. 

'There are people getting it who simply helped people get in or out of a taxicab,' he said, indirectly referring to Duncan.

At another point in the interview, Paul mocked President Barack Obama's advice in 2009 that Americans could stop the spread of the H1N1 flu by coughing into their shirt sleeves instead of their hands.

'I can't believe that you don't think it's enough of a plan to prevent worldwide pandemic to cough into your elbow,' Paul told Ingraham, according to CBS News. 'If you just bring your elbow up to your mouth and cough into it, surely that will stop a worldwide pandemic.'

Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national who had traveled to the U.S. from Liberia on September 20 to visit family, has been quarantined at a Dallas hospital for Ebola after reportedly contracting the disease in Liberia while putting an infected family friend into a taxi and riding with her to the hospital

Already, the CDC has raised it's travel warning to the highest level possible - three- and warned Americans against travelling to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in order to avoid the possibility of accidentally contracting the infectious disease.

The White House indicated on Wednesday that it has no intentions of placing new restrictions on travel to and from areas effected by the Ebola outbreak, however.

Rather, the Obama administration 'has taken the step of recirculating our guidance' to law enforcement agencies, the airline industry and medical professionals 'to make sure that people are aware that there is an important protocol that should be implemented if an individual presents with symptoms that are consistent with Ebola,' Earnest said.

The White House official reassured the press that Duncan was neither displaying nor experiencing symptoms or Ebola during his flight. 

'So there’s nothing about this case that we know so far that would indicate any weakness or any flaws in [our border protection] system right now,' he insisted.

But as another reporter pointed out minutes later, Earnest's comments suggested that the U.S. has not yet developed a way to effectively screen people who may have contracted Ebola before they reach America and their bodily fluids become toxic.

And before this week, the CDC had claimed that it was unlikely that an infected traveler would bring Ebola to the U.S. That assurance has clearly proven to be inaccurate.

Paul expressed concerns Wednesday that the troops President Barack Obama is sending to West Africa to help keep the peace in the Ebola hot spot could end up becoming carriers of the disease and beginning their own epidemic.

'You also have to be concerned about 3,000 soldiers getting back on a ship,' he said. 'Can you imagine if a whole ship full of our soldiers catch Ebola?'
