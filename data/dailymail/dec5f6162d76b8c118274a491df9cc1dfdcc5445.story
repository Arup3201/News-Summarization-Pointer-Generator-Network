Children from poor backgrounds and one-parent families are more likely to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a new study has revealed.

Researchers found a link between social and economic status and childhood ADHD in Britain.

A team led by the University of Exeter Medical School analysed data from the Millennium Cohort Study, a database of more than 19,500 British children born between 2000 and 2002.

Children from poor backgrounds and one-parent families are more likely to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a new study has revealed

The study, published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, showed that there was a greater prevalence of ADHD among children from families living below the poverty line.

The researchers found the average family income for a household with a child affected by ADHD was £324 per week, compared to £391 for those with unaffected children.

The study also found the chance of parents in social housing having a child with ADHD was roughly three times greater than for those who owned their own homes.

The researchers also discovered that the odds of younger mothers having a child with ADHD were significantly higher than for older mothers.

Mothers with no qualifications were more than twice as likely to have a child with ADHD as those with degrees, and lone parents were more likely to have a child with ADHD than households with two live-in parents.

Information was gathered from surveys when the children were nine months old, and at the ages of three, five, seven and 11.

Study leader Dr Ginny Russell, of the University of Exeter Medical School, said: ‘There is a genetic element to ADHD, but this study provides strong evidence that ADHD is also associated with a disadvantaged social and economic background.

‘Some people believe that ADHD in children causes disadvantage to the economic situation of their family, but we found no evidence to support that theory.

‘It's important to discover more about the causes of this disorder so that we can look towards prevention, and so that we can target treatment and support effectively.’
