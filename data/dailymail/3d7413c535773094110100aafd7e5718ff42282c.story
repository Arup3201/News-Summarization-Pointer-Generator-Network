Manchester City are set to sign Wilfried Bony after opening talks with Swansea over a £30million deal for the Ivory Coast striker.

Both clubs confirmed on Tuesday that negotiations are under way, although a transfer fee and personal terms have yet to be agreed. Swansea are demanding £25m up front plus £5m in add-ons, and Bony wants to double his earnings to £120,000 a week.

Although the 26-year-old is at a training camp in Abu Dhabi preparing for the Africa Cup of Nations, his representatives were discussing terms with the Premier League champions on Tuesday night.

The Ivory Coast international has scored more Premier League goals (20) than any other player in 2014

Wilfried Bony - 20

Sergio Aguero - 16

Edin Dzeko - 14

Yaya Toure - 14

Daniel Sturridge - 13

Wayne Rooney - 13

City must ensure that any deal falls in line with the financial limitations imposed on them by UEFA for breaching financial fair play rules. Manuel Pellegrini would also have to cut one foreign player from his Champions League squad if he wants to register Bony for next month’s tie with Barcelona.

But Pellegrini realised he needs a fourth senior striker after seeing Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic all sidelined by injury last month. 

Speaking during a press conference on New Year's Eve, the City manager said: 'I think that is just one of the 20 or 30 names I have read from the beginning of the season until today that we are [supposedly] interested in.

2013-NOW: Swansea City (54, 25)

2010-NOW: Ivory Coast (32, 11) 

'I don't think we are going to be too busy in this window. We have restrictions about the amount of money and about the number of players we can put in the Champions League, so I don't think it will be a special transfer window for our team.'

The potential move for Bony, who is also a target for Real Madrid, would be against Swansea manager Garry Monk's wishes after he stated on Monday that he hoped no players would leave the Liberty Stadium in January.

Asked whether he was expecting phone calls from clubs enquiring about Bony, Monk said: 'I hope not. I can't afford to lose players.

'We haven't got a big squad as it is but what we do have is quality. I am looking to add, I'm not looking to lose any players.' 

Bony is expected to be absent for several weeks as he takes part in the Africa Cup of Nations during January

City's interest is unsurprising since Bony scored more Premier League goals than any other player during the 2014 calendar year - racking up 20 strikes to place him above City's leading scorer Sergio Aguero (16), while Yaya Toure and Edin Dzeko netted 14 apiece.

However, speaking to Sportsmail in January after netting his 18th goal in a 1-1 draw with Crystal palace, Bony said: 'I really don't care about statistics.' 

The 26-year-old insists he is more concerned with achieving  personal ambitions while dismissing the perception that he is an easy-going guy. 'I have to be in control,' he said. 'I must. It is very important.

'I am a hard person - I am not an easy guy. I want always to be in control, everything I do in football and outside. At the end of the season I want to do this, after next season I want to do that. 

'Goals, objectives. I know who can help me, who can't help me. The people who can help, from the beginning I talk to them: "I want that and that - you have to help me. And if you help me, I help you."

'I like to use my power. Wherever we go, in the disco or anywhere, I am always talking about this every day.

'I always tell my friends - Roland Lamah, (Wayne) Routledge, Jonathan de Guzman - if you have time to put in a cross do it because you know I am good with my head. You don't have to be in the box, give me the ball.

'If I head the ball one time it can be a goal. I try to be there in the right place. If I am not there, it is my mistake. 

'Didier Drogba texts me to say: "Don't let anyone destroy your objectives." My objective is 20 goals with Swansea this season, then the World Cup and in the future I want to play the Champions League. No one will destroy my objectives.'
