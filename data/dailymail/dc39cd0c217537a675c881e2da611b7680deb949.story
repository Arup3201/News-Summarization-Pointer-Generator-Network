Billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen has been unmasked as the secret lone bidder who shelled out $101million for a sculpture by Alberto Giacometti at a New York City auction last week.

Sources familiar with the details of the sale told local media outlets, among them Page Six, that Cohen, the founder of the now-defunct investment firm SAC Capital Advisors, scooped up the masterpiece titled 'Chariot' last Tuesday at Sotheby's impressionist and modern art sale.

The rare 1951 bronze sculpture, one of only six created by Giacometti, features an elongated goddess-like figure perched atop a wheeled chariot.

The sculpture had been in the collection of Alexander Goulandris, a Greek shipping magnate, since 1972

The price paid by Cohen was just shy of breaking the $104.3million record for the Swiss artist. The sculpture had been in the collection of Alexander Goulandris, a Greek shipping magnate, since 1972. 

Mr Cohen's big-ticket purchase comes a year after he was forced to pay record-setting $1.8billion to settle criminal insider trading charges.

The scandal led to the closing of SAC Capital, but Cohen has since opened a new outfit called Point72 Asset Management, which mostly handles the billionaire's own fortune.

The family firm has posted impressive gains of 15 per cent as of the end of last month.

Cohen, 58, is widely considered to be one of the most successful hedge fund managers of all times.

With a personal net worth of $10.3billion at his disposal, he has been heavily investing in art, amassing one of the most remarkable collections in the US valued at over $1billion.

Ms Cohen's legal complications evidently have done nothing to curb his appetite for masterpieces.

While SAC Capital was being investigated for insider trading by the US Department of Justice in 2012, Mr Cohen paid Las Vegas casino tycoon Steve Wynn $155million for Pablo Picasso's La Reve.

The painting had to undergo restoration following a notorious 2006 mishap in which Mr Wynn accidentally put his elbow through the canvass, opening a six-inch gash, just before it was set to be shipped to Cohen.

Steve Cohen, who is married and lives in Greenwich, Connecticut, also owns a Jackson Pollack and Damien Hirst's 1991 famed shark sculpture, which he purchased a decade ago for $8million, according to multiple reports.

The large-scale work featuring a tiger shark in formaldehyde had been on loan until 2010 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 2012, it was sent to the Tate Modern in London for a Hirst exhibit. 

A number of Cohen’s artworks are expected to go on the auction block at Christy’s this week, among them an Andy Warhol piece.

According to his profile at Forbes Magazine, Cohen, the son of a dressmaker from Manhattan’s garment district, launched his career in finance with $7,000 that was supposed to go towards his tuition at Wharton School.
