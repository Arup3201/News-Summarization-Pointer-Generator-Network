It would take a brave soul to first bring one of these into the office.

The French-designed bubble desk has just taken off in Paris and protects the worker under a plexiglas dome, cutting them off from the rest of their colleagues.

It comes as part of a complete office design that includes a giant communal desk, eight Ficus Panda Trees, a cloakroom and a kitchen.

It ensures the worker remains detached from the sneezes and banter of daily office life although quite what it does for one's popularity remains to be seen

The Bubble Desk Office designed by Christian Pottgiesser ensures you no longer have to hear or laugh at your colleagues' jokes

Bubble desking ensures you don't catch office germs. You may need to step outside though if you want to catch the gossip

The bubble desk idea originated in France by Christian Pottgiesser and has been taken up by two Parisian offices

The thinking behind the bubble desk is that offers the worker privacy while still being connected to a large, communal desk.

It is a modern take on partitioned office space popular in the 1980s and which offered privacy but no visibility or sense of connection to colleagues.

The trees are designed to compensate for the lack of scenery and are rooted into beds of soil buried out of sight.

So far two French companies, Pons and Huot have taken on the office design by Pottgiesser.

Steve Bays from Century Office, an office design and supply company based in Essex, said: 'I can see the benefit of the bubble desk in large public areas such asÂ  libraries where people want to shut themselves away and read or something, but I'm not sure it would work in an office.

People like to talk, to consult with each other. You don't want to have to go and knock on your colleague's cocoon to talk with them.
