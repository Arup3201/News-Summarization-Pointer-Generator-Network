It was unusually calm in the city of Donetsk today, as government troops and separatists observed a  ‘Day of Silence’ after weeks of bitter fighting.

But, amid the shaky ceasefire, there was a stark reminder that a truce in war-ravaged eastern Ukraine is still a long way off.

As both sides prepared to hold a 24-hour ceasefire, intense shelling could be heard echoing around the Kuibishevskiy district of Donetsk, killing residents and shattering people's homes.

Despite the successful ceasefire, the scenes of chaos provide residents with a stark reminder that a truce in war-ravaged eastern Ukraine is still a long way off 

The night-time shelling came just hours before a temporary truce between both sides, which has sparked hopes of further peace talks and eased tensions. 

Today, residents attempted to deal with the aftermath of the attack, scouring the debris and picking apart the rubble of what used to be their homes. Some residents lay dead amid the chaos.

Fighting in the past few weeks has been intense around the international airport in the city of Donetsk, the main separatist stronghold. 

The rebels are trying to wrest the ruins of the airport from government control, in the latest stage of the war waged by pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine's east. 

Kiev's military said troops had recorded six violations by the rebels during the ceasefire, while six Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the 24 hours before the truce came into force.  

Today, Russia also resumed shipments of natural gas to Ukraine, despite it being shut off for six months over a dispute over price.

'We have declared a Day of Silence three times in the past. This is the fourth time. One hundred and ninety-two people have been killed since September 5,' army chief of staff Viktor Muzhenko told journalists in Kiev.

In Donetsk, rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko said he had ordered his forces to cease firing from 10am. They were told only to respond if they were attacked  first. 

The so-called 'day of silence' comes after a ceasefire in September, which has been regularly breached.

Talks by a 'contact group' in Minsk in early September led to a 12-point blueprint for peace. 

The United Nations says more than 4,300 people have been killed in eight months of conflict and thousands of homes have been destroyed

But, since then, separatists have defied Kiev by holding elections for officials. Ukraine also accuses Russia of sending more troops and weapons to aid the rebels.

Moscow, which denies its troops are fighting in Ukraine, says Ukraine has violated the Minsk deal by continuing to fight. 

The United Nations says more than 4,300 people have been killed in eight months of conflict which began after a Russian-backed president was ousted by street protests in February. 

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a meeting of the contact group was planned, but that an easing of tensions in eastern Ukraine was still 'a long way off'.
