The mother of murdered teenager Danielle Jones has spoken of the 'torture' of never being able to bury her daughter.

Linda Jones has said she has accepted her daughter's murderer Stuart Campbell will never reveal where Danielle's body is, more than 12 years after she went missing.

But she said never being able to bury her daughter 'tortures' her every day.

Heartache: Linda Jones has spoken of the 'torture' of never being able to bury her daughter Danielle, who went missing in 2001

Tragic: Mrs Jones said she had 'not been given the chance to say goodbye' to her daughter properly

Victim: Danielle Jones went missing in June 2001 after leaving home for school. The following year her uncle Stuart Campbell was jailed for life for her murder and kidnap

The 15-year-old disappeared in June 2001 after leaving home to catch a bus to school.

In December 2002 her uncle, Stuart Campbell, of Grays, Essex, was convicted and jailed for life for her kidnap and murder following a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court. Appeal judges upheld those convictions.

Campbell has never admitted how he killed Danielle or where she is.

In a documentary to be aired tonight, Mrs Jones, of East Tilbury, Essex, has described the pain of never being able to bury her daughter.

She said: 'The fact that he won’t give us that one peace.  I’ve accepted that he won’t but to not be able to bury her and know where she is, is an everyday tortuous position.'

Mrs Jones said: 'We’ve not been given the chance to say goodbye to her properly.'

Convicted: Stuart Campbell has never admitted how he killed Danielle or where she is

Mrs Jones said even though there is no grave to visit, she is able to go to the memorial garden built at Danielle's school.

She said: 'For us it’s really important to have somewhere to go. As I say, normally you would have a grave, we don’t have that. 

'We’ve got all our memories indoors but I
think sometimes you need somewhere to go and lay flowers and just have a
bit of peace.

'As a mum, you protect your children and I didn’t protect her enough' 

- Linda Jones

'As hard as it is to come here I think also it makes you almost feel you are with her in happier times, when she was a schoolgirl.'

Mrs Jones and her husband Tony have raised two sons, which she said is what helped pull her through the tragedy.

Mrs Jones said: 'She was a beautiful fun loving girl, she had everything to live for. I miss her every minute of every day.'

At an inquest in 2005 senior detectives said police would 'not give up' trying to find her body.

Detective Chief Superintendent Steve Reynolds said police believed Campbell had killed and disposed of Danielle's body alone.

Campbell, a father-of-two whose hobbies included body-building and karate, denied any involvement in her disappearance.

But the prosecution produced evidence that Danielle, a pupil at St Clere's School, Stanford-le-Hope, was seen talking to a man in a blue Transit van shortly after leaving her house. Campbell owned an identical van.

The jury of seven women and five men heard that Campbell had developed an 'irresistible sexual attraction' for his niece.

He regularly picked her up from the 
school bus stop in his van; sent her 'an inordinate amount of text 
messages' and kept a diary chronicling his contact with her.

Campbell claimed to have been in another part of Essex on the morning Danielle disappeared, but expert analysis of his mobile phone showed that could not be true.

Investigations also revealed that his phone and Danielle's phone were together near his home for around 30 hours after she vanished.

In a bag in Campbell's loft, police found female underwear including a pair of cling-top women's stockings stained with blood. The stockings bore traces of Campbell's and Danielle's DNA.

In the documentary Mrs Jones said: 'I think he is the most despicable repulsive thing there is.  I don’t know of a word other than monster that could describe him. 

'As a mum, you protect your children and I didn’t protect her enough.'

In 2005 Campbell appealed the decision claiming he did not get a fair trial.

In the appeal, his lawyers argued that the trial judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, should have excluded highly prejudicial evidence to the effect that Campbell had a fixation for young girls and taking photographs of them, and downloaded material about teenage girls from the Internet.

They also urged Lord Justice Kennedy, Mr Justice Simon and Mr Justice Bean to rule that one of the jurors should have been discharged because he lived next door but one to a police officer involved in the case and another senior investigating officer lived in the same village.

The appeal however was dismissed.
