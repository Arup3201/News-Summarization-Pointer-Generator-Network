It appears Raheem Sterling's bout of tiredness may be coming to an end after he was able to drive to Liverpool training on Wednesday.

The winger has hit the headlines since telling England boss Roy Hodgson that he was 'too tired' to start Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia.

On Tuesday midfielder Jordan Henderson drove the 19-year-old to Liverpool's Melwood training base ahead of their Premier League trip to QPR at the weekend.

This time though the pair arrived separately as Brendan Rodgers' side look to get their season into gear after a slow start. 

Hodgson left Sterling out of the starting line-up for England's 1-0 win over Estonia after the young playmaker complained of feeling tired.

Sterling came on a second half substitute and won the free-kick that captain Wayne Rooney scored from to give England a 1-0 victory.

Hodgson is expected to hold talks with Rodgers this week regarding their shared use of Sterling - and he could be left out of the trip to QPR on Sunday if deemed too tired again. 

Sterling has  received stern criticism for his actions and even appeared to speak out on his Twitter against his detractors.

Despite this, a spoof Twitter account called '@tiredsterling' has been created mocking the Liverpool star. It has more than 16,000 followers to date.
