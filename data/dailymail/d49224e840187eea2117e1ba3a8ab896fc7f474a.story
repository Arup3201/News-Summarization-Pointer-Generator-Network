The plan: State officials released this report detailing how they wanted to limit STDs and teen pregnancies

New York state officials are considering sexual education classes for elementary school students and HIV tests for 13-year-olds, according to a new report.

The New York State Youth Sexual Health Plan, released this week, found that one in four adolescents is likely to contract a sexually transmitted disease, and that about 60 per cent of all high school students in the state are sexually active before graduation.

Authorities believe that taking a proactive approach to teaching children about sex is the only way to mitigate a future spike as children become sexually active at an increasingly younger age – but not all parents agreed.

‘I work around teenagers and the vast majority of them at 13, when I ask them if they’re sexually active, look at me like, ‘Are you crazy?’ Parent Joshua Stillman told WCBS.

‘And to put HIV testing on the plate in front of them, I think, would be not only weird for them, but probably make them think about something that’s not anywhere close to their consciousness.’

The state’s first-ever organized attempt to confront this growing challenge is bolstered by as many as 10 per cent of all students saying they did not use any birth control during sexual intercourse.

Only 7.2 per cent said they used both a condom and another birth control method, according to the report.

'Reproductive and sexual health are key health issues for adolescents and young adults,' Acting State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zuckertold the New York Post.

'Providing accurate and comprehensive information to protect adolescents’ health and prepare them for responsible decision making is a public health priority.'

Even more troubling, 63 per cent of all STDs are contracted by people aged 15 to 23-years-old, the state said. And one in five new cases of HIS is reported in an individual under the age of 25.

‘Thirteen might be, you know, a little young for that, but sadly not by much,’ Jeffrey Ernstoff told WCBS.

Reading, writing and... sex ed: State officials want children as young as elementary school to begin learning about sex

The main objective of the comprehensive plan is to prevent the spread of STDs among schoolchildren, and also to prevent teen pregnancies.

Almost 3,700 babies were reported born to mothers 17 or younger in 2012 in New York, the report said. One of the suggestion made to limit these births is to provide contraception to children as young as 15.

Sex education is also suggested for students beginning as early as elementary school for those school districts that are interested.

The plan has yet to be put into action and is merely just a series of suggestions. It is not clear how long it would take for it to be put into place.
