A gardener spelled out his wedding proposal using hedge plants - then took his girlfriend on a surprise helicopter ride so he could pop the question.

Liam Ireland, 31, and three assistants including his father Tony, 64, spent two hours arranging the greenery so when viewed from the air it read: 'Will you marry me Melissa'.

His girlfriend Melissa Moss, 26, spotted the message written in topiary as they hovered 500ft above the fields in Eckington, Worcestershire.

Proposal: Liam Ireland rearranged these hedges to spell out his proposal - then took his girlfriend up in a helicopter so she could see his message

Hedge farm manager Liam said: 'Melissa was looking out of the window and just saw "will you marry me Melissa?" spelt out in box-hedging.

'As
she turned round from looking out the window I was there with a ring. 
Luckily she said yes and gave me a kiss. It was a lovely moment.

'I couldn't get down on one knee because I was strapped into the helicopter but I hope I was forgiven.

'I
just thought what other way to do it than spell it out in box hedging 
and fly over. It's a little bit different really. I'm just really 
pleased with how it all worked out, it was perfect.'

As a ruse to get his girlfriend into the helicopter, Liam said his boss Simon Williamson, 59, had arranged for 
them to fly over Readyhedge nurseries, where he works, to take some aerial photographs.

Romantic message: Liam, 31, spent two hours creating the message with the help of three assistants at Readyhedge nurseries where he is a manager in Eckington, Worcestershire

Happy couple: Liam and his girlfriend Melissa Moss stand next to the helicopter. He spent four months planning the proposal

They travelled to Staverton Airfield, Gloucestershire, 15 miles away, before embarking on the 45-minute round trip.

The letters of the design were around eight foot deep.

He said: 'It was really nerve-wracking as there were so many factors that had to work together for it to come off, like the weather, lots of details which could have gone wrong.

'The lowest the helicopter can go is 500ft so I was hoping we'd made it big enough to read from that distance. I didn't sleep too well the night before as all these things were playing on my mind.

'We circled the nursery a few times but eventually found the spot. Liam, from Eckington, had an engagement party arranged for them when they landed following the proposal on September 14.

Melissa, a dental nurse, said she was taken completely by surprise when Liam proposed.

Engaged: Liam and Melissa, a dental nurse, have been together for just over four years. They celebrated their engagement with a trip to Dubai last week

She said: 'It was a big shock, I didn't have a clue it was going to happen so it came as a total surprise.

'Liam told me his boss had organised for him to go up to take some pictures and he said he thought it would be nice if we both went up. I couldn't believe it when I saw the message.

'I've been on cloud nine ever since, I've not stopped smiling since it happened. My friends have been quite envious, Liam's very romantic and I feel very special that he went to such a big effort for me.'

The couple, who have been together just over four years, celebrated their engagement with a trip to Dubai last week. They said they will start scouting for wedding venues in the coming months.
