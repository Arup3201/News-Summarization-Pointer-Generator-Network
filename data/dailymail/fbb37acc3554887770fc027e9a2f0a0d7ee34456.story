Terrence Potter took eggs from protected species including owls, spoonbills and kestrels

A fanatical collector was yesterday convicted of stealing hundreds of birds eggs from the nests of protected species.

Terrence Potter had become ‘obsessed’ with collecting them and police found more than 1,000 in glass cabinets when they raided his home.

He spent two years wandering the countryside looking for nests to raid ‘because he liked the look of them’, magistrates were told.

Among 548 illegally held eggs were those belonging to protected and endangered sparrowhawks, kestrels, owls and spoonbills.

During questioning the HGV driver, from Huddersfield, spent four hours telling police about every egg.

When police and RSPB officers entered his house on June 22 last year, they found many eggs with their contents deliberately blown out.

Potter, 55, initially told police that all the eggs were old and legal.

But he very quickly ‘fell on his sword’ and admitted some were obtained illegally from nests across northern England.

Speaking after the case, Andy McWilliam, investigator for the UK National Wildlife Crime Unit, said: ‘He became a bit obsessed with eggs.

'He has only recently became involved with it. He got the bug and we think that he has only been taking from nests for the last two years.

'He had an old legal collection and has been adding to that.

‘He just wanted them to look nice. He didn’t target specific species, he just liked the look of their eggs.’

A forfeiture order was made for the eggs as 'they can be used in some educational way'

Potter pleaded guilty under the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act and was given a two-year conditional  
discharge with £85 costs at Huddersfield Magistrates Court.

Det Con Bryan Butterworth, a  wildlife
crime officer with West Yorkshire Police, added: ‘I hope this case has 
educated people not to commit these sorts of crimes.’

A forfeiture order was made for the eggs and they may be used for educational purposes.

The Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 is the primary legislation which protects animals, plants, and certain habitats in the UK.

All birds, their nests and eggs are protected by law and it is thus an offence, with certain exceptions to:
