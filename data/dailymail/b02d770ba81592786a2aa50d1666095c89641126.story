In the battle of the heartwarming Christmas adverts, one airline has gone all out to deliver festive cheer.

Canadian airline WestJet delivered its own Christmas miracle by sending Santa Claus to the Dominican Republic and spread some joy in the Caribbean.

WestJet employees and volunteers headed to a small community and placed a surprise sleigh placed in the middle of town.

During the day, community members all had a chance to communicate to Santa via the sleigh’s video screen and tell him what they wanted for Christmas this year.

Requests were as diverse as a new engine for a man’s motorbike taxi business to a skateboard to a horse.

The next morning, the volunteers headed out shopping to gather all of the items on the community’s list.

WestJet then invited everyone down to the beach for a Christmas party for a surprise - everything that they had asked for in personalised blue waterproof bins.

Except for the horse, which was hand-delivered by Santa himself.

They even brought in snow for the kids to play in, marking the first time that most of the Nuevo Renacer community had ever seen it. 

And if those heart-warming acts weren’t enough to get you choked up, WestJet assured that tears would flow by unveiling one final surprise for the poor coastal residents: a brand new community playground. 

After the community left their holiday gift wishes for Santa, they were all called to the beach the following day

'In this community, they have to drive 20 minutes and actually pay to use a playground, so by introducing a playground, it really does create a safe environment for them to play in,' Corey Evans, Sponsorship, Community Investment and Experiential Marketing Manager at WestJet explained. 

Corey also spoke about the company's decision to take this year's Christmas Miracle abroad.

'We chose to shoot the video this year in the Dominican Republic because we’d been working with our partners, Live Different, there since 2012,' he said. 

'We’ve really gotten to know the residents, so over the years of working with them, we’ve really just identified their core values to be similar to ours.'

WestJet is a low-cost Canadian carrier, travelling to the United States, the Caribbean and Europe.

It was founded in 1996 and is currently the second-largest Canadian airline behind Air Canada.

The brand is also known for it's emotional Christmas adverts, with this year's Christmas Miracle marking the third in the trilogy.

'This was really the last chapter in the Blue Santa trilogy,' Corey added.

And if that weren't enough, WestJet also surprised the town with a brand new playground set

But don't fret - that doesn't mean that WestJet is abandoning their tear-jerking holiday adverts forever.

'If our guests feel that it’s something they’d like to see again next year, we’ll certainly put our heads together and see what we can come up with.' 

Last year, WestJet set up a video booth where travellers could tell Santa their holiday gift wishes in real-time.

From there, travellers boarded their flights from Hamilton and Toronto, Ontario, and by the time they landed at their destination, special gifts were waiting to greet them at baggage claim.

In 2012, the airline staged a gigantic holiday flash mob at the Calgary International Airport before a sold out flight to Toronto.
