Risky treat: Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson had to be taken to hospital after allergic reaction

An MP had to be given life-saving treatment after eating a cake that contained nuts.

Doctors had to intervene after Jo Swinson, 33, who has nut allergies, suffered a severe allergic reaction and began struggling to breathe.

Miss Swinson, MP for East Dunbartonshire and a parliamentary aide to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, suffered anaphylactic shock after attending the Colossal Cake sale, a Help for Heroes event at a Guide Hall in Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow.

During the event on Saturday the politician, who has nut allergies, inadvertently ate a piece of cake that contained the ingredient.

She began to feel unwell and took an antihistamine.

However, around an hour later her condition worsened and she was taken to the Southern General Hospital.

The MP was kept in overnight for observation and returned to work yesterday.

Around one in 100,000 people in Britain have severe reactions to nuts and around 20 die annually.

Foods such as peanuts, tree nuts  – including almonds, walnuts, cashews, and Brazil nuts – sesame, fish, shellfish, dairy products and eggs can all trigger a severe reaction, often referred to by the medical term anaphylaxis.

Following her recovery Miss Swinson, who is Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment Relations, Consumer and Postal Affairs and a junior equalities minister, spoke of the frightening incident on Twitter.

She said: ‘Thankfully now recovered from anaphylaxis episode yesterday: huge appreciation to the fab staff at Southern General for keeping me alive.’

Last night, a Lib Dem spokesman said the incident was ‘wholly accidental’. He added: ‘Miss Swinson spent the night in hospital as a precaution. She was back to work today as normal. She doesn’t like taking time off.’

Fellow politicians expressed their best 
wishes. Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw tweeted: ‘All the best to 
Jo Swinson following her near-death allergic reaction.’

Anaphylaxis can affect the whole body, often within minutes of exposure to the substance that has caused the allergic reaction.

Besides foods, wasp or bee stings, natural latex, penicillin or any other drug or injection can also trigger an attack.

Symptoms typically include generalised flushing of the skin, a rash similar to that caused by nettle stings, a swelling of throat and mouth, and difficulty in swallowing or speaking.

In the most severe cases, sufferers can collapse and fall into unconsciousness.

Any allergic reaction occurs because the body’s immune system reacts inappropriately in response to the presence of a substance that it wrongly perceives as a threat.

An anaphylactic reaction is caused by the sudden release of chemical substances, including histamine, from cells in the blood and tissues where they are stored.

This mechanism is so sensitive that minute quantities of the allergen can cause a reaction. The released chemicals act on blood vessels to cause the swelling in the mouth and anywhere on the skin.

There is a fall in blood pressure and, in asthmatics, the effect is mainly on the lungs. Many people who know they have a serious allergy carry adrenaline auto-injectors.

Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, acts quickly to constrict blood vessels, relax smooth muscles in the lungs to improve breathing, stimulate the heartbeat and help to stop swelling around the face and lips.

The Colossal Cake sale is an annual event run through Help For Heroes to raise funds for the country’s servicemen and women.

Last year a total of 700 individual sales were held around the country to help the wounded.

Scots TV star Lorraine Kelly is a patron of the charity. Speaking at the launch of the event, she said: ‘I am honoured to be a patron. It gives you a chance to say thank you and give something back.

‘It’s the fourth year of the Colossal Cake Sale and it’s just got bigger and better.’

Last year more than £100,000 was raised through the cake sales around the country.
