The League Cup has always been used by Manchester United as a chance to showcase their academy graduates.

And with Louis Van Gaal facing an injury crisis in defence ahead of Tuesday night's second round tie at MK Dons, a 22-year-old right-back called Marnick Vermijl could be pressed into action.

But who is he? Here's our lowdown on the young Belgian.

Name: Marnick Vermijl

Age: 22

Club: Manchester United

Position: Right-back

Why all the fuss?

Van Gaal faces a bit of a headache as he makes his team selection for the tricky-looking trip to Milton Keynes as United enter the League Cup at the second round stage for the first time since 1995.

Chris Smalling limped off with a groin injury in the first half of Sunday's Premier League draw at Sunderland and is unlikely to make it, while Rafael is also a doubt.

New signing from Sporting Lisbon Marcos Rojo hasn't received his work permit in time to make his debut and so United are struggling a little for men at the back.

Enter Vermijl, who could be in line to make his first United start in two years at stadium:mk, most likely alongside Jonny Evans and fellow academy graduate Michael Keane.

The 22-year-old has waited some time since his United debut, which came on September 26, 2012 when he played 77 minutes in a League Cup tie with Newcastle United.

It was a campaign in which Vermijl appeared in the United squad on other occasions - twice in the Champions League and at Chelsea in both the League Cup and FA Cup - but didn't gain any further time on the pitch.

Now, having gained more experience during a season-long loan with Dutch side NEC Nijmegen, it looks as though he will have another chance to impress.

What's his background?

Vermijl was born on January 13, 1992 in Peer, a small town close to the Dutch border in the north of Belgium and joined the academy of Standard Liege at the age of 16.

With United's scouting network well established in the Low Countries, Vermijl was picked out despite not making a senior appearance for the Belgian top flight side.

His delighted dad revealed the news of his contract at Old Trafford in 2010, after a £250,000 compensation payment had been agreed with Liege.

'They said he was the best right or left-back they had seen in years,' Dirk Vermijl told Het Laatste Nieuws.

'[Sir Alex] Ferguson told me that Marnick in the following years would become a fixture in the Manchester United squad.'

Ferguson and then-reserve team coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had clearly seen potential in him, as they had in his compatriot Ritchie De Laet.

And he made an immediate impression when he scored twice, playing in a more advanced position, in a pre-season friendly with Shamrock Rovers.

Part of the attraction had been Vermijl's ability to play right across the back four, or even on the right side of midfield, but he quickly settled into the right-back role.

He became a mainstay in United's reserve team during the 2010-2011 season and picked up a winners' medal in 2012 when United defeated Aston Villa on penalties.

His consistent displays in the reserves led to Ferguson calling him up to the first-team squad for the first time in the League Cup last 16 tie at Aldershot on October 25, 2011. He didn't feature in the 3-0 win, however.

The following season was another encouraging one for Vermijl, with his handful of first-team squad selections balanced with a leading role in United winning the inaugural Under 21 Premier League.

He scored one and created another in the Old Trafford final against Tottenham, inspiring a United comeback from two goals down to win 3-2.

Under 21 coach Warren Joyce shortlisted him for the club's Reserves' Player of the Year award, capping a fine year.

Going Dutch

With the departure of Ferguson and the arrival of David Moyes at the start of last season, Vermijl was sent out on loan to NEC in Holland, where he was a regular starter at right-back.

He performed well, with three league and one Cup goal during the season, which unfortunately culminated in relegation from the Eredivisie for the Nijmegen club.

His performances resulted in a call-up to the Belgium Under 21 side, but Moyes seemed indifferent to the young player.

In March, Vermijl's agent said his client's future would depend on whether Moyes remained at Old Trafford. 'If the manager stays, then it does not look good because he let Marnick go quite easily to NEC.

'If Moyes is sacked, it may open greater chances.'

As we all know, Moyes was shown the door and Vermijl, who has one year left on his contract, is back in the frame at United, with Van Gaal keen to assess what he can do.

He played a full 90 minutes in the Under 21 side's 1-1 draw with Liverpool at Anfield last week and could now be set for another first-team chance, especially if the injury crisis worsens.

Where does he play?

As mentioned, Vermijl is a right-back, or the right-sided operator in Van Gaal's hallmark 3-5-2 formation.

But in his younger days, he was more of a forward or a winger and so isn't afraid to get forward in support of the midfield if necessary.

One of his main attractions when United first signed him was his versatility and, if required, Vermijl could slot in right across the back line.

Strengths and weaknesses

Vermijl is well-regarded for his consistency and, in the Dutch league at least, was seldom found wanting by speedy wingers.

If beaten, he possesses the pace to recover position and is a reliable winner of the ball in the tackle. During his campaign in Holland, he received just one booking.

If he is to be part of Van Gaal's team, he'll have to show quality going forward and he does have a decent quick-step to get beyond defenders and a fairly good cross.

One thing that was exposed in the Eredivisie, however, was his passing, with too many balls going astray.

International honours?

Yes, Vermijl has been capped by Belgium at every level from Under 17 to Under 21. In all, he has 43 caps for Belgium across the various standards and has scored five times.
