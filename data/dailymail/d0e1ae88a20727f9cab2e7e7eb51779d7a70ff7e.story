Barack Obama headed back onto the campaign trail today for the first time after Superstorm Sandy struck and said now is not the time for 'petty differences' between parties, but then went on to attack his rival Mitt Romney.

Obama, who is visiting three key swing states today, told the crowd at an airport rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin: 'All the petty differences that consume us in normal times seem to melt away.

‘There are no Democrats or Republicans during a storm, just fellow Americans.’

Obama said today: ‘Our hearts go out 
to those who have lost their loved ones. We pledge to help those whose 
lives have been turned upside down.

‘In the end we're all in this together - that we rise and fall as one nation, one people.’

He added: ‘We've also been inspired these past few days. Because when disaster strikes, we see America at its best.’

The spirit seen after Sandy, he said, had ‘carried us through the trials of the last four years’.

But Obama then contradicted his high-minded appeal for bipartisanship to attack Romney.

‘He’s
saying he’s the candidate of change,’ he said. ‘Well, let me tell you 
Wisconsin, we know what change looks like. And what he’s offering isn’t 
change.

Obama described 
Romney’s proposals on taxes, social policy and regulation as a return, 
adding that ‘turning Medicare into a voucher is change, but we don’t 
want that change’.

He said;
‘know what change looks like because I fought for it,” he said. “And 
after all we’ve been through together, we sure as heck can’t give up 
now.'

Deep in conversation: President Obama and New Jersey governor Chris Christie showed a united front

Obama advisers 
believe that the images of the president comforting survivors of Sandy 
on a visit to New Jersey yesterday has given him fresh hope of 
re-election in five days time and halted Romney's momentum.

A poll taken in the wake of Sandy 
found that 80 per cent of likely voters approved of Obama’s response to 
the storm and the president incorporated the hurricane into his stump 
speech after campaign hostilities resumed.

Meanwhile, Romney appeared in Roanoke, Virginia. He said Obama had run out of ideas.

‘I
mean, unfortunately what you've seen before your very eyes is a 
campaign that keeps on shrinking and shrinking and shrinking to smaller 
things,' he said.

‘He's
been out talking about how he's going to save Big Bird and then playing
silly word games with my last name, or first, and then attacking me day
in and day out.

'Attacking me doesn't make an agenda, doesn't get people back to work. We don't need the Secretary of Business to understand business.

'We need a president who understands business, and I do. That's why I'll help get this economy going.'

Obama is spending the last Thursday of the 2012 election campaign hitting three swing states that he won comfortably in 2008 – Wisconsin, Nevada and Colorado.

Romney is also on defence, trying to shore up Virginia, which Republicans hoped would be safe by now, with three events there.
