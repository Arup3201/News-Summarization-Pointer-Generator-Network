Twelve members of Osama Bin Laden's family will be deported from Pakistan this morning.

Bin Laden's three widows, their eight children and one grandchild will be sent to Saudia Arabia, after admitting entering Pakistan illegally.

The family's lawyer Muhammad Aamir told AFP on Tuesday: 'They will go tonight or tomorrow early in the morning. 
After 12 tonight they can be deported any time.'

Two of the terrorist leader's former 
wives - Khairiah Sabar and Siham Sabar - will be sent to Saudi Arabia.

The third, Amal Ahmed Abdul Fateh, will join them, but may later be moved on to her native Yemen with her five children.

A Pakistani intelligence official confirmed the deportation would take place 'sometime around midnight' on Tuesday and said 'most likely
they would be flown to Saudi Arabia'.

All three widows, along with Bin Laden's 17 
and 21 year old daughters, were placed under house arrest earlier this 
month having pleaded guilty to living illegally in Pakistan.

Just a few days ago the Al Arabiya television network released footage from inside the 'guest house' in Islamabad, where Bin Laden's family members have been holed up .

But the boarded-up windows and a 
heavy armed presence outside given an indication that while the place 
may serve as a home for the occupants, it is also a prison for Osama's 
relatives.

illegal residency in the country

The three former wives of Bin Laden have been in Pakistani custody since U.S. Navy SEALs raided the terrorist's compound in Abbottabad and killed the al Qaeda leader in May 2011.

All the women confessed to impersonation, illegal entry into Pakistan and staying illegally, so a trial was not required. Mr Khalil said his clients would not appeal the 'lenient" sentence.

Fateh told Pakistani investigators that Bin Laden spent years on the run in Pakistan after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, moving from one safe house to another and fathering four children.

A deposition taken from Fateh gives the clearest picture yet of bin Laden's life while international forces hunted him. He and his family move from city to city with the help of Pakistanis who arranged 'everything' for them. she is reported as saying.

She told police she never applied for a visa during her stay in Pakistan.
