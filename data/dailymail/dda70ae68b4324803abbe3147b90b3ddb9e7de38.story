This skin-tight bodycon dress was so tight that it saved 21-year-old Zoe Turner's life by stopping her bones piercing her internal organs 

A graduate survived a horrific taxi crash with a cement mixer because a skin-tight red dress stopped her bones from piercing her internal organs.

University graduate Zoe Turner, 21, from Wakefield, bought the £34.99 bodycon dress from website Missguided and wore it to a Christmas party.

But, on her way home, a cement mixer crashed into Miss Turner's taxi, leaving her and three friends with life-threatening injuries.

Doctors told Miss Turner that her snug dress had acted like an old-fashioned corset and had stopped her bones popping out and perforating vital organs.

The medics said she could have suffered fatal internal injuries if she had not been wearing such a tight garment.

Miss Turner said: 'I couldn't believe my dress saved my life. That's the best £35 I've ever spent.

'Although I didn't come off lightly, the end result could have been a lot worse. 

'The doctors told me that if I hadn't worn such a tight dress which held in place my bones as the car impacted, I would have most definitely punctured vital organs as my bones went out of place.'

Miss Turner, a psychology and criminology graduate from Nottingham Trent University, had put on the figure-hugging dress to attend her mother's work do at Leeds United's Elland Road football ground.

Her mother Sharon, 44, works as a customer service worker.  

But the drama unfolded when Miss Turner got into a taxi with a group of friends for the 35-minute journey home.

Just after the taxi had pulled off, a cement truck careered into the driver's side of the vehicle.

Miss Turner, who lives at her family home, was in the passenger's seat wearing a seatbelt.

But her three friends in the back were not strapped in and were knocked unconscious due to the impact. 

The driver's head went through the front window.

She said: 'I was in unimaginable pain. My body was aching and I just remember thinking - I have to get my belt off.

'The pain and restriction my dress was causing was unbearable and I stumbled out of the car. 

'I thought everyone else was dead. I was in so much shock I didn't realise how serious my injuries were.'  

Firefighters arrived within five minutes and cut open the vehicle to free the passengers.

Miss Turner was rushed to Leeds General Infirmary where she was sent for a C.T. scan and given a brace to hold her pelvis together, along with morphine.

She had multiple injuries including a fractured pelvis, fractured vertebra and broke sternum.

She said: 'I laid in the hospital bed unable to move my legs. I was so scared, I didn't know if I'd be able to walk again. I just wanted my parents there - the pain was piercing.'

The driver of the taxi suffered a broken neck, while her friends survived with broken arms, eye sockets and pelvis.

After five days in hospital, Miss Turner was released to go home, just in time for Christmas.

She had been due to start a new job at a care home but has had to put it on hold.

She added: 'My mum took me home in her car. My wounds were starting to heal and I was able to walk a lot more than I had been able too.

'But getting in the car was the hardest thing. When my mum put on the brakes I literally broke down crying.

'I am lucky to be alive, the thought of not having worn that dress makes me shudder.

'That £35 was honestly the best I've ever spent. I'll never forget that red dress - It's just a shame it didn't survive too!'
