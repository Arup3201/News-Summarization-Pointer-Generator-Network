The estranged husband of a woman who went missing on Friday is travelling home from Afghanistan, where he is on active duty as a Marine, to help look for his wife.

The disappearance of Brittany Killgore, 22, from Fallbrook, California, comes just days after she filed for a divorce from her husband of two years, Cory Killgore, 22.

Police believe another Marine, 45-year-old Louis Ray Perez, may have been the last person to see Killgore alive and said they suspect foul play after he was 'uncooperative' during their questioning.

Missing: Brittany Killgore was last seen on Friday with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge

Perez was arrested Sunday on an 
unrelated charge of possession of an AR-15 assault rifle and is being 
held in San Diego Central Jail.

Killgore had told friends she was 
going to 
spend Friday evening in the Gaslamp Quarter in San Diego. Police do not 
think she ever made it there, but her cell phone was recovered in the 
area.

San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department search-and-rescue teams searched a canyon near Fallbrook in 
the hope of finding the missing woman on Monday. Officers also searched her apartment.

Sheriff's lieutenant Larry Nesbit said 
Perez, who is based at Camp Pendleton, was questioned about Killgore's 
disappearance.

In an interview for KTLA 5 news Nesbit added: 'Based on the totality of the circumstances - the fact that she is in
normally in constant contact with her friends but she has not been heard from since Friday and the fact that
Mr Perez was less than forthcoming in his interview with us - we believe that
there there is a strong likelihood Brittany is the victim of foul play.'

Ms Killgore was last seen wearing a dark purple evening gown, with purple floral glitter patterns. She is 5 ft 7 inches, 130 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes, according to the Sheriff’s department.

It is believed she filed court documents for divorce earlier this month from her husband of two years.

Mr Killgore is currently on duty in Afghanistan, but is on his way home because of his wife's disappearance. He is not suspected of being involved in the case.

Christopher Oglesby, a friend who lives in the same apartment complex as
the Killgores, told ABC News they were 'a very loving couple'.

He said: 'I could say they liked to hang out with one another, but his job made 
it hard for him to sometimes be able to find the time.'

Fellow family members are also reported to be flying to Fallbrook from other parts of the U.S.

Investigators say they don’t know whether the marine in
custody and the marine in Afghanistan know each other and won’t reveal the exact nature of their relationship.

Perez is being held on $500,000 bail and set to be arraigned on Wednesday.
