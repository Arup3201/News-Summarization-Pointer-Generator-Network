Mary McCormack reportedly threw husband Michael Morris out of their Los Angeles home on Sunday night after he was photographed kissing married Smash star Katharine McPhee.

The Murder One actress, 44, is believed to have taken the action when her husband of 10 years revealed that photos of him smooching Katherine McPhee - who is said to be embarrassed by the entire situation - were about to break online.

A source told Page Six that Morris, who directed McPhee on NBC’s cancelled musical TV series, attempted to buy the images himself to avoid a scandal.

But the director’s bid was unsuccessful and the shots of him kissing Katharine, 29, were posted on website TMZ.com.

Something to tell us?: Smash star Katharine McPhee was seen kissing the show's director Michael Morris on Sunday, despite the fact both of them are married to other people

Singer/actress Katharine, 29, has been married to 47-year-old Nick Cokas since 2008, and he is also her manager.

However
 sources close to the couple told the website that the two have been 
'separated for six months and are currently living apart'.

The Brothers & Sisters director 
has been married to former West Wing actress Mary for just over a decade, and 
the couple have three young daughters together, aged between two and 
nine.

Friends of Mary told Us Weekly, 'She is so cool and the nicest person. It's so sad that this happened to her. She's truly great.'

Katharine and Michael are believed to be dating after they were pictured locking lips in Los Angeles at the weekend after having lunch together, TMZ reported.

Despite reports claiming Mary threw him out last weekend, she may have split with Michael earlier.

In early October talk show host Chelsea Handler - who split from Andre Balazs this summer - told her audience that she likes to go out with her guest Mary, when the actress interrupted and said of the talk show host, 'She’s single now, too, so it’s like, you can’t keep up.'

In photos taken on Sunday, Michael was still wearing his wedding ring as he and Katharine walked to her car together, while the actress and singer's ring was noticeably absent from her hand.

Katharine
 and Michael were also spotted holding hands and cuddling while 
strolling around Hollywood together, while both wore jeans and aviator 
sunglasses.

Katharine also 
sported a holey black knit jumper and an electric blue jacket, while 
Michael wore a pale blue T-shirt under a black corduroy jacket.

 Family, after just three weeks on the air due to dismal ratings.
