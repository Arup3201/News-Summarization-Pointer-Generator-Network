Zurich Insurance confirmed today that former finance director Pierre Wauthier left a suicide note naming the firm's then-chairman Josef Ackermann.

The Swiss company said today that the letter documents the relationship between the pair but said that it would be 'inappropriate' to elaborate further.

Mr Ackermann quit as chairman yesterday after saying he had come under pressure to take 'my share of responsibility' following the apparent suicide of Mr Wauthier.

Chief Financial Officer Mr Wauthier, who had worked for the company for 17 years and had joint British and French citizenship, was found dead at his home on Monday.

Shock announcement: Zurich Insurance chairman Josef Ackermann resigned yesterday following the apparent suicide of finance director Pierre Wauthier

Police are not looking for any other parties in connection with the death.

A spokesman for Zurich told MailOnline: 'We were informed that such a letter exists and we are aware of its content.

'It is correct that it relates to the relationship between Pierre Wauthier and Josef Ackermann but it would be inappropriate for us to further elaborate on it.

'It is a very difficult situation, especially for the families and friends of Pierre Wauthier.

'We all need to respect their privacy during this difficult time and we deeply regret his passing, which was completely unexpected.'

The latest development comes as Mr Wauthier's widow Fabienne criticised Mr Ackermann's management style.

According to Swiss press, Mr Wauthier's widow is reported to have accused Mr Ackermann of forcing her husband 'into a corner' and cited his 'tough management style' as a factor in his death.

Details of the note emerged a day after former Deutsche Bank chief executive Mr Ackermann issued an extraordinary statement in which he said Wauthier’s family had made allegations against him in connection with the unexplained death.

Ackermann said: ‘The unexpected death of Pierre Wauthier has deeply shocked me. I have reasons to believe that the family is of the opinion that I should take my share of responsibility, as unfounded as any allegations might be.

‘As a consequence, I see the 
possibility of a continued successful board leadership to the benefit of
Zurich called into question. 

'To avoid any damage to Zurich’s reputation, I have decided to resign from all my board functions with immediate effect.’

Vice chairman Tom de Swaan will replace Ackermann.

It
is the second potential Swiss suicide in recent months at a high 
profile firm. Carsten Schloter, chief executive of telecoms firm 
Swisscom, also took his own life.

Wauthier,
who had a wife and two grown up children, joined the firm as head of 
investor relations and rose rapidly to board level.

He was described by one colleague as ‘rational, easy going and wonderful’.

A
spokeswoman for Zurich Insurance did not elaborate on what allegations 
Ackermann was referring to surrounding Wauthier, who was 53 and left a 
wife and two children.

Zurich's chief executive Martin Senn had said he was not aware of any dispute that could have driven Wauthier to his death.

'We didn't spot any conflicts that could or should have led to such a death,' Senn told Swiss television.

However, a former colleague of Wauthier's said there was pressure within the company to increase its share price.

Two insurance executives outside the firm's headquarters in Zurich described their colleagues as 'somewhat shellshocked' and said Ackermann's departure was a surprise for the industry.

One of Europe's leading economic power brokers, Ackermann, 65, transformed Germany's Deutsche Bank and played a role in the euro zone's financial crisis as chairman of the Institute of International Finance (IIF).

He was touted as a candidate for top 
financial jobs in his native Switzerland before he took the relatively 
low-key role at Zurich last year. He also sits on the boards of Royal 
Dutch Shell, Siemens and Investor AB.

Ackermann
has survived controversy before. In 2006, he paid 3.2 million euros, 
without admitting wrongdoing, to avoid trial in a dispute over payments 
to executives at telecoms firm Mannesmann, where he sat on the board of 
directors.

One of few 
senior industry figures to keep his job through the current financial 
crisis, he became a forceful public advocate for the Swiss financial 
sector after leaving Deutsche.

'Ackermann's
mission when he came was to shake up Zurich, to infuse a more dynamic 
mentality into it,' said a person close to the former Zurich chairman.

'Yes, insurance isn't banking. But there was still more oomph to be wrung out of Zurich, he thought.'

When Ackermann took over as Deutsche Bank chief executive in May 2002, radical surgery was needed. Burdened with high costs, it was slipping as one of the largest lenders in Europe.

The first non-German to lead the bank, Ackermann was asked to transform it into a 'global champion', but fell out with a German establishment that saw Deutsche's traditional role as supporting national industries.

When Ackermann joined the Frankfurt-based institution, the bank derived more than 70 per cent of revenues from Germany. Ackermann sold off industrial holdings and slashed jobs, and Deutsche now makes less than 30 per cent of its revenue there.

However, his arrival at Zurich failed to impress investors and there was considerable change in the top ranks.

Former general insurance head Mario Greco left a year ago to become head of Italian insurer Generali. Two weeks ago the head of its life insurance arm, Kevin Hogan, left to become AIG's head of consumer insurance.

On Aug. 15, Zurich said it would be hard pressed to meet certain performance targets after posting a 27 percent fall in second-quarter net profit due to natural disaster payouts, which topped those of European rivals because of its high exposure to the United States.

The shares closed down 2.47 percent at 228.80 francs, but remained above the low of 225.6 francs that they reached on Tuesday after news of Wauthier's death. The volume of shares traded on the day, however, was the highest in over three years.
