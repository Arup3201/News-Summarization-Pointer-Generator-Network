Fifty Shades of Grey will be shown in French cinemas to children as young as 12, after the country's film board gave it the second lowest possible age rating.

The film was recently named the most erotic mainstream movie in a decade, after featuring more sex on screen than the 100 raunchiest films released in 2014 put together.

The president of France's Board of Film Classification defended the low rating, saying Fifty Shades a 'schmaltzy romance' and 'not a film that can shock a lot of people'.

'Schmaltzy': France's Board of Film Classification has given Fifty Shades of Grey a '12' rating

The country's motion picture rating system has four grades - U, 12, 16 and 18, meaning that Fifty Shades has been given the second lowest certificate. 

France is known to rate films with sexual content lower than many other countries, including the U.S. and the UK. 

Films rated 'U' in France  include American Beauty, where Kevin Spacey's character has an affair with his teenage daughter's best friend, and Eyes Wide Shut, which features a famous sex scene between Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise - both rated 18 in the UK.

Jean-Francois Mary, president of France's Board of Film Classification, deemed that Fifty Shades of Grey 'isn't a film that can shock a lot of people.'

Mr Mary considers the film, that contains scenes of nudity and sadomasochism between an entrepreneur and a virginal student, 'a romance, you could even say schmaltzy.'   

Kids allowed: Even though Fifty Shades of Grey centers around the relationship between a young female student and a BDSM-obsessed man, the president of France's Board of Film Classification said it is 'not a film that can shock a lot of people'

Kids allowed: Children as young as 12 will be able to see the film, starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, which features a dozen sex scenes, making up a fifth of its entire running time

The '12' rating follows accusations by several American and British reviewers that the film is too tame. 

In a barrage of reviews published on Tuesday night, most of those who sat down with the raunchy adaptation ahead of its 13 February release date lamented its 'run-of-the-mill' lovemaking.

One critic pointed out that sex only makes up 15 minutes of the two-hour runtime. Another pointed out that there are no visible genitals, no orgasms - and not that much nudity. 

Fifty Shades, which stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as the BDSM-loving Christian Grey, features a dozen sex scenes.

The 'raunchiest of the decade' accolade was awarded the film after website Mr Skin, which ranks films by amount of sex scenes, released data seen by the Sunday Times. 

However, the film's director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, has said that although the film is true to E L James's best-selling book, it may not be as explicit as people might be hoping for.

'The thing that was most difficult was how and where to pepper the sex, and to not make it feel like it was gratuitous,' she said. 

Defence: Jamie Dornan, pictured arriving in  Berlin, Germany, today has said he would not call film 'erotic'

'So it had to be a really strong part of the story, and I had to give characterisation to each sex scene, to make them different.

'I didn't want it to be graphically explicit, and I know that's going to be disappointing to some people,' Mrs Taylor-Johnson added in an interview with The Guardian newspaper:

'It's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality. So I don't think it goes into the realm of porn.'

Mrs Taylor-Johnson's opinion has been backed up by the film's leading man, who said he does not consider Fifty Shades an erotic film.  

'I just wouldn't use the word "erotic" - it brings up different ideas for me. I just think we tried to make a good picture, you know?,' he told the Sunday Times.

Fifty Shades of Grey has been rated R in the U.S. for its 'graphic nudity' and 'unusual behavior', and is rated 18 in the UK.

Last week it was reported that the film had been banned from being shown in cinemas in Malaysia, where it was deemed 'too sadistic.'

The series of three Grey books written by James, 51, from London, has reportedly sold over 100 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 52 languages.
