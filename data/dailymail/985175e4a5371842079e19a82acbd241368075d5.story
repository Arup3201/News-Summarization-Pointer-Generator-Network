Lee Clark has been sacked by Birmingham City to end his two-year spell at the club.

Assistant Steve Watson has also been dismissed after a run of only two wins in 12 Championship games this season, with ex-Watford boss Billy McKinlay among the contenders to be brought in. 

Clark had on Monday morning been adamant he would not walk away from the job despite mounting criticism from fans.

‘I understand I am not flavour of the month with the supporters and lots of them would like to see somebody different in there,’ Clark said in a press conference ahead of Tuesday's trip to Blackburn.

‘But I am not too sure if things would change in terms of can anyone else get any more from them? I think I am getting everything out of the players.

‘There has been a lot of tough days, I have got to say. So I haven’t put up with that for over two years just to walk away.’

But hours later the decision was made for him, as the clubs Hong Kong-based owners decided defeat at home by Bolton on Saturday was the tipping point.

The board, led by executive director Panos Pavlakis, brought an end to Clark’s tenure with Birmingham one point and one place above the relegation zone. Clark has been forced to work on a tight budget with top-earning players on no more than £5,000 per week, one of the lowest wage bills in the division.

But he had only overseen one victory at St Andrew’s in more than 12 months and narrowly avoided relegation to League One in the final seconds of last season.

Clark was told his time was over shortly after lunchtime on Monday. He and Watson were both on one-year rolling contracts.

First-team coach Richard Beale and head of recruitment Malcolm Crosby have been put in charge of the side on a caretaker basis.

A statement released on the club’s official website read: ‘Birmingham City Football Club has parted company with Lee Clark and Steve Watson with immediate effect.

‘The search for a successor has already begun and the Board will look to make an appointment in the very near future

‘The club wishes to place on record its sincere thanks to Lee Clark and Steve Watson for their combined efforts over a period stretching back to June 2012.’
