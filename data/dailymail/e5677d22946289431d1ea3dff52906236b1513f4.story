If you walk down the peaceful shopping street in Canada, you'd never believe this sleepy hardware shop was about to appear in one of the biggest films of the year.

Now fans of the hotly-anticipated Fifty Shades of Grey film, which will be in cinemas on Valentine's Day, are expecting to swarm the Ladner Village Hardware Store in Delta, Vancouver - and stock up on bondage material to boot.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, owner James Price said before agreeing to let filming happen in his store, he read the book to make sure there were no ‘sticky’ scenes taking place on his premises.

But now he is stocking up on red rope, cable ties and duct tape and has a special display in the window.

 ‘I have an adult daughter, and she told me ‘Dad, this is a really big deal’’, he said.

‘So I read the book, and once I found there was no bad or sticky parts happening in the store, I thought there was no reason to not have them in.

‘As people have heard about the filming they’ve been giving me copies of the book – I had six at one stage’.

While James has stopped short of creating a dedicated ‘bondage’ section in the shop, they have placed red rope, cable ties and red duck tape in the window of the store ahead of Valentine’s Day to attract kinky punters.

‘It’s not normal for people to come in for that purpose, but it has happened’, he said.

‘The way they say it is that the item they want is ‘not for its original purpose’, though they don’t tend to say it’s for a bedroom scene.

‘All the equipment you would need for that kind of activity is already in the shop.’

Since filming took place over two weeks in January last year, James said they had already had fans come into the shop to see where the action between Anastasia and Christian took place.

‘I had a lady from Seattle, who was following everything about Fifty Shades’, he added.

‘She was in the store trying to place exactly where it all happened, but I had to say to her the crew brought their own stock and equipment to use during filming.’

The independent shop is just one of the businesses looking to benefit from the film, which was filmed in locations across Canada and North America. 

Crew and riggers spent two days on set at Ladner Village Hardware Store to transform the small shop into Clayton's Hardware, where student Anastasia Steele - played by Dakota Johnson - works part-time.

In a trailer released by Universal the mysterious Christian Grey, played by Irish actor Jamie Dorman, flirts with Ana while buying cable ties, masking tape and rope - which, unbeknownst to her, he is saving for a kinky sex game.

Later they embark on a torrid love affair as Grey teaches Ana about the intriguing world of BDSM.

The shop is one of several real-life locations used by filmmakers as they transformed EL James best selling novel for the big screen. 

The Heathman Hotel, named 18 times in James' sexy book, is also a real place - but wasn't used in the filming of the movie.

That hasn't stopped the owners of the hotel, based in downtown Portland, Oregon, attempting to cash in on its association with the hit series.

Its website proudly boasts: 'You've found us. We are that hotel. The infamous haunt of main characters Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.

'If you've read this enchanting love story, you know that the Heathman plays a leading role'. 

Their bar has created its own drink inspired by the book - the '50 Shades' cocktail with gin, fresh tangerine, pomegranate juice, lemon and fresh thyme - and offers a series of special packages.

But filming of other sex scenes in the hotly-anticipated film took place in the swanky Fairmont Hotel in Vancouver. 

Visitors to the luxury landmark hotel in the heart of the city can stay in the same bedrooms used in the filming - and take advantage of the centre's 'Take The Elevator Home' romantic package.

Filmakers also travelled to Seattle to film Escala, home to Christian Grey's luxury penthouse where he secudes Ana. 

The crew filmed outside the 31-storey high building - where a starting price for a penthouse apartment is $1.6 million - but re-created his apartment using a set at North Shore Studios in Canada.

The studios, based in North Vancouver, were also used to film part of the Twilight Saga, Catwoman and epic 2012. 

And while the stars are tied up on screen, director Sam Taylor-Johnson has revealed the cast and crew have been instructed to keep tight-lipped about the upcoming film.

She told the London Evening Standard that details of the film are being closely guarded, in case anyone gives away vital details before the release on Valentine’s Day.

The security is tighter than on any other film made in Hollywood', she said.

'Ordinarily I would have screened it for people by now, but I’m not allowed to. I haven’t even been allowed a friends and family screening.'
