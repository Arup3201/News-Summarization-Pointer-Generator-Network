Chijindu Ujah became the third quickest British man over 100 metres in history by running 9.96secs in Hengelo, Holland, on Sunday.

The 20-year-old European junior champion took 21 hundredths of a second off his lifetime legal best to set a new UK Under-23 record and become only the fifth British athlete to break the 10-second barrier.

Ujah finished second in Hengelo behind Richard Thompson of Trinidad and Tobago, who ran 9.95secs, but his stunning performance has set up an fascinating battle between the country’s best male sprinters at this month’s British Championships in Birmingham.

Champion: Ujah is the European Athletics Junior champion after wining in Rieti last year

James Dasaolu ran 9.91secs at last year’s trials, veteran Dwain Chambers has recorded 10.06secs and 20-year-old Adam Gemili has clocked 10.07secs already this season, while Richard Kilty became the world indoor champion over 60m earlier this year.

Ujah’s breakthrough performance, however, has probably come too late for the sprinter to be included in England’s team for the 100m at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

The squad was due to be released on Mondau but, although the announcement has been delayed, successful athletes were notified last week.

Ujah, who combined athletics with studying applied sciences at college, trains at Lee Valley in north London with long jumper Greg Rutherford and talented young British sprinters such as Sean Safo-Antwi, 23, and Deji Tobias, 22.

The group work under Jonas Tawiah-Dodoo, a rugby and sprints coach and former apprentice of American ‘super coach’ Dan Pfaff, who guided Rutherford to Olympic gold at London 2012.

Ujah said: 'Right now I’m feeling so happy. I’m just over the moon about my performance.

'I knew Richard Thompson was in form and for me to make him dip I knew that we must have gone fast.

'Before the start I knew there was good conditions, much more cooler than it was for my heats, and I thought: "Anything is possible here. Just try and win the race." and the time came.

'I came second to Richard Thompson and he’s a world class athlete.

'I did have a feeling this was coming. My group has been training well and we are all on form. I knew what type of shape I was in when I ran 10.17 in Loughborough three weeks ago.

'I’m still in shock, it hasn’t sunk in. Soon I think it will sink in.

'I’ve been getting lots of messages from family and friends and seen it all on Twitter, it makes me happy.

'I just want to take one step at a time. There is still more work to do.'
