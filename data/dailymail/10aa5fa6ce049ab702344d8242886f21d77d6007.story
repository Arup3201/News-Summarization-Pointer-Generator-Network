Holby City star Rosie Marcel was told she would be raped and killed in a campaign of intimidation and abuse by a super-fan.

Sarah Rumbelow, 21, has been jailed for two and a half years after she sent hateful emails, tweets, messages and letters to Miss Marcel, who plays surgeon Jac Naylor in the BBC drama.

Rumbelow was completely obsessed with the actress and spent almost a year abusing her in 2011.

Victim: Actress Rosie Marcel was targeted by a stalker who sent her a barrage of threatening messages

To cover her tracks she set up bogus e-mail addresses from where she sent many sick messages.

But after the terrified star called in the police detectives were able to establish Rumbelow was behind them. 

The
21-year-old, of Brockley, south London pleaded guilty at St Albans 
Crown Court to putting a person in fear of violence by harassment.

The charge specified that between January 1 2011 and last autumn she posted threats to harm or kill Rosie on social network sites and sent threats by email and in letters.

It was also revealed that she had breached a restraining order not to contact the actress.

Simon Wilshere, prosecuting, told the court on Friday that the actress had received hateful communications during 2011 threatening her with both violence and sexual violence.

He said there was 'an element of concealment' in the way Rumbelow had sent the communications because she had set up a variety of bogus accounts so her real identity would not be revealed.

Even so Hertfordshire Police when called in were able to track her down and she was arrested last October and remanded in custody after masses of newspaper clippings and articles about the actress were found at her home .

The 36-year-old married actress, who 
lives near St Albans, is the daughter of television director Terry 
Marcel and sister of writer and actress Kelly Marcel.

In May Rumbelow appeared in custody before Judge John Plumstead to plead guilty to the charge of harassing Miss Marcel.

By then it had been discovered she suffered from ADHD and Asperger's syndrome.

The
judge adjourned sentence so that Rumbelow could be assessed to see if 
she was suitable for treatment for her problems and a non custodial 
sentence.

He granted her bail and made a restraining order that she was not to contact the actress.

However, after being released from custody, Rumbelow immediately set about sending the actress spiteful messages including one to her sister which said 'Your sister is finished. Rosie will get hers soon. Watch this space.'

On Friday the court was told Rumbelow had again tried to cover her tracks and when arrested tried to shift the blame onto someone else.

Alex Radley defending said Rumbelow had 'clear health issues' and asked the judge to consider passing a suspended sentence because treatment was available for her in the community.

Judge Plumstead said 'This is a disturbed person’s crime, but it can’t be said she is free of blame.'

Passing sentence he told Rumbelow: 'I don’t doubt that you are a young woman who has significant difficulties.'

But, he said, her problems had not reduced her understanding that what she was doing was wrong.

He jailed her for two and a half years, but told her the time she had spent in custody, a total of some nine months would count towards the time she serves.

Miss Marcel was in court for Friday’s sentence.

As she left the court with a friend, she said: 'It was a just sentence. Now I just want to get on with my life.'
