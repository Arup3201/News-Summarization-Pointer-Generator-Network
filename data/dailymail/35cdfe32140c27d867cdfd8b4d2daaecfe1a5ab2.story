Whiplash claims are soaring despite a drop in the number of accidents, motor industry experts revealed today.

Up to 90 per cent of third party claims involve relatively small amounts of cash are bogus whiplash cases.

It means that Britain - already dubbed the ‘whiplash capital of the 
world’ with more than £1billion of bogus claims a year - is now also 
beating the US as the most litigious country in the world.

Fresh evidence shows that there has been a boom in 'claims farming' by law firms of backdated incidents which has artificially boosted the number of claimants

Leading insurance analysts say new figures show whiplash claims have increased by a disproportionately high level at a time when claims for accident damage to cars have decreased.

By rights, crash and injury data should run in tandem, they say.

They blamed the alarming disparity on a boom in American style ‘claims farming’ by law firms and claims firms of backdated or historic incidents which is artificially boosting the number of whiplash claimants - many of them bogus or exaggerated.

The fresh evidence was revealed by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) which independently assesses financial risks and liabilities to businesses and pension funds.

It said there was a five per cent increase in the proportion of accidents involving third-party injury claims involving bodily injury in England and Wales last year.

Nine out of ten of these were from ‘small whiplash-like claims’ of under £20,000 - with the average being £9,512.

However, at the same time there has been a decrease in third party insurance claims involving damage to cars.

The report was authored by David Brown, chairman of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries who recently told MP watchdogs that up to 60 per cent of whiplash claims were ‘exaggerated, misrepresented or fraudulent’ meaning up to £1billion claims a year are wholly or partly bogus.

He explained: ‘A total of 90per cent of the third party injury claims made in 2012 were what we consider ‘small claims’ for less than £20,000.’

‘Coupled with the average claim figure of £9,512, this suggests that the majority of claims continue to be for whiplash-like injuries.’

A number of claims made last year were for accidents in 2011 and 2010, suggesting that a high volume of back-dated claims have been filed. This is known as ‘claims farming’.

Mr Brown noted: ‘The data we have collected for the last four years clearly shows a decrease in the number of accidents and you would expect that to correspond with a decrease in the number of third party injury claims.

‘Instead we have seen an increase in injury claims.

The motor insurance industry paid out £2.2billion in whiplash claims in 2011

‘This could mean that people are driving less safely. However police data shows that the number of motor accidents involving casualties has decreased. The other conclusion that you can draw is that claims farming is on the increase.’

Mr Brown added: ‘The proportion of claims for insured accidents involving bodily injury is higher in the UK than in the USA, which is generally considered the most litigious jurisdiction.’

He noted the recent suggestion by the House of CommonsTransport Select Committee - to which he gave evidence - that the UK was the ‘whiplash capital of the world’ noting: ’They may well have a point.”

The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries’ figures were based on analysis of third-party motor claims, looking at data from around 95percent of the UK motor insurance industry.

The motor insurance industry paid out £10.7 billion in claims in 2011, of which whiplash claims cost approximately £2.2 billion, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) has told MPs.

With whiplash claims representing 20 per cent of overall claims expenditure, this represents approximately £90 of the average premium.

The ABI blamed the dysfunctional compensation system’ for leading to a ‘growing compensation culture’ in the UK, as well as ‘aggressive marketing by claims management companies’.

Referral fees paid by claimant solicitors were banned from April 1 this year.

One reason for the ‘whiplash epidemic’ is that it is cheaper to settle than to fight cases suspected to be fraudulent, say insurance experts.

The scale of the scandal in England and Wales is much greater than countries like Germany, where lawyers’ claim fees are severely limited. Insurance underwriters noted: ‘It’s nothing to do with German necks being stronger than British necks.’

David Powell, manager of the Lloyd’s Market Association which manage 90 insurance underwriting syndicates told MPs that bogus claims were ‘in overdrive’ because whiplash was too easy to fake with too few checks.
