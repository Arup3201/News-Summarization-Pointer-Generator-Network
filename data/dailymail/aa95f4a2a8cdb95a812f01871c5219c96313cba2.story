These images show the disgusting hygiene standards at a Chinese restaurant run by an owner who has been convicted three times for having filthy kitchen conditions.

Shek Kwok, 60, was handed a life ban for selling food after he admitted a string of serious hygiene charges relating to the Oriental Cuisine restaurant in Brantham, near Ipswich, Suffolk. 

When council workers arrived at the restaurant on January 9 last year they were horrified to discover surfaces and floors were unclean while crispy seaweed was sitting in a dirty microwave.

A fridge door was damaged and dirty and cardboard was being used to repair the problem, Ispwich Crown Court heard.

The team also found there was a danger of cross-contamination between two sinks, a dirty washing up rack with packaged food, open raw eggshells and pieces of battered chicken on it.

One of the wash basins was full of water with droplets of oil on the surface, blocked by rubber gloves, a floor grate was also damaged.

Rice in a half-open hot cupboard was tested and found to be at a temperature between 50C and 53C when it should have been kept at 63C.

Shek Kwok, 60, admitted seven serious hygiene offences at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday

There was an outbreak of dangerous salmonella food poisoning at the same restaurant in 2002 when it was called the Szechuan Inn.

The incident resulted in successful civil claims by customers affected which ended with payouts by the restaurant's insurers.

In 2004 Kwok and his company were each fined £700 and ordered to pay costs for offences under two sections of the Food Safety Act.

At the same restaurant in 2008, he breached three food hygiene offences and again had to pay fines and costs totalling more than £16,000.

Following this third incident, which involved seven charges, recorder Simon Blackford made him subject to an indefinite hygiene prohibition order and gave him a community order with a three-month curfew from 9pm to 2am.

Kwok, of Colchester, Essex, was also ordered to pay £750 costs and £60 to the victims' fund.

Recorder Blackford said he knew that he was depriving Kwok of his livelihood but he stressed that due to his history and attitude he had to act because he posed a real danger to the public.

After the hearing, Vincent Dréau, a Food and Safety Officer for Babergh District Council which brought the prosecution, said: 'The sentence imposed on Mr Kwok today reflects not only the poor standards found on the premises last January, but the consistently poor levels of hygiene over several years.

'Over the years we have worked hard to help Mr Kwok achieve an adequate standard of food safety but he has failed to take advice or properly act on recommendations made.'
