Scandal: Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni will appear before a disciplinary panel tomorrow

A leading racing trainer will face charges of giving his horses steroids tomorrow after the sport was engulfed by a huge doping scandal.

Mahmood Al Zarooni will appear before a disciplinary panel of the British Horseracing Authority after samples taken from 11 of his horses were found to have contained traces of anabolic steroids.

Al Zarooni trains the horses for the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed, and faces losing his licence if he is found guilty.

He bizarrely claimed yesterday that he did not know what he was doing was wrong as the sport was engulfed by one of the most significant alleged doping scandals in recent history.

The 37-year-old Godolphin trainer has officially been charged with rule breaches related to prohibited substances, duty to keep medication records, and conduct prejudicial to racing.

The hearing will be held at 2.30pm at BHA headquarters in London.

Samples were taken earlier this month from 45 horses trained by Al Zarooni at Moulton Paddocks Stables, Newmarket.

Subsequent analysis revealed 11 of them contained ethylestranol and stanozolol, which are prohibited substances.

The BHA said today that Al Zarooni had admitted giving banned substances to a further four horses - Comitas, Sashiko, Vacationer and Tearless.

Those horses were under the care of the Newmarket trainer, but had not been subjected to testing.

Ladbrokes said they were refunding £200,000 of bets on horses which have tested positive for banned substances, in a move to reassure punters.

Other bookmakers also pledged to refund ante-post bets which are placed a long time before the race.

Normally punters lose their money if a 
horse is forced to pull out, but bookmakers have agreed to refund wagers
because of the scandal.

One of the bleakest episodes for British racing,Godolphin and, more especially, SheikMohammed there’s no other reaction to the anabolic steroids found in 11 horses trained by Mahmood Al Zarooni.

British racing likes to think of itself as one of the world’s cleanest — we feel superior as the US allows raceday medications.

While British racing hasn’t become a hotbed of drugs, to have one of its biggest players embroiled in the biggest drug scandal I canremember is a body blow.

International flat racing is hugely important but it is nothing if you lose confidence that the sport is clean.

Few people in flat racing will dare to say too much about Godolphin asthe huge majority are tied financially into the Sheik’s empire, but they must be seen to face rigorous investigation and scrutiny from the authorities — or fail to rebuild their reputation.

Al Zarooni didn’t just commit the most heinous act for a trainer on a whim. Maybe he felt forced to turn to drugs to secure success.

Sheik Mohammed has been hailed as a great leader — those qualities are needed more than ever to save his racing empire’s reputation.

Among the horses that tested positive was unbeaten 1,000 Guineas hopeful Certify. Between them, the 11 have won more 
than $2m (£1.31m) in prize money.

Certify has now been banned from taking part in the race on May 5, in a hugely embarrassing 
development for Al Zarooni’s Godolphin stable boss Sheikh Mohammed bin 
Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai.

Three other thoroughbreds owned by the 
stables - Desert Blossom, Artigiano and Restraint of Trade - have also 
been banned from the classics.

The 
gravity of the situation was reflected in a statement from Godolphin 
racing manager Simon Crisford yesterday.

He said: ‘This is a dark day for Godolphin. We are all shocked by what has happened.

‘His Highness Sheik Mohammed was absolutely appalled when he was told 
and this is completely unacceptable to him. We will await the outcome of
the BHA inquiry before taking any further internal action.

‘Sheik Mohammed has instructed me to begin an urgent review of all of 
our procedures and controls. That is already underway and we will take 
advice from the BHA in completing it.’

Al Zarooni is one of two British-based 
trainers responsible for the horses of powerful owners Godolphin, the 
brainchild of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed.

The trainer apologised yesterday - but said he did not realise what he was doing was wrong.

‘I deeply regret what has happened,' he said. 'I have made a 
catastrophic error. Because the horses involved were not racing at the 
time, I did not realise that what I was doing was in breach of the rules
of racing.

‘I can only apologise for the damage this will cause to Godolphin and to racing generally.’

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 
Live, David Mountford, chief executive of the British Equine Veterinary 
Association, said: 'The rules are fairly clear, and I think most 
trainers would be aware of those rules. The use of anabolic steroids in 
training is banned in UK racing.

'It's
obviously being taken very seriously by all concerned. And I would 
expect if, as looks likely, people are found guilty of breaching the 
rules, they would be treated severely.'

None of the Al Zarooni horses to test positive can currently run. His stable was subject to a random test on April 9.
