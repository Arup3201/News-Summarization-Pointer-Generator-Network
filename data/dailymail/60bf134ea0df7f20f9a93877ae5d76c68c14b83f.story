A Florida man celebrating the homecoming of his newborn daughter is dead after a stray bullet allegedly fired by his ex-con neighbor went through his backdoor and hit him in the head earlier this week.

To make the tragic death even more heartbreaking, 33-year-old Justin Ayers daughter was born on Sunday - Father's Day.

Authorities in Panama City were called to Ayers' home about 6:12 p.m. Tuesday, after a someone called 9-1-1 to report that he had been shot while standing in his home with friends and family celebrating his daughter's homecoming.

Tragic: Justin Ayers was shot dead in his kitchen while celebrating bringing his newborn daughter home from the hospital

Felon: Neighbor Charles Shisler admitted to firing the shot with a gun he possessed illegally because he is a convicted felon

Officers found a bullet hole in the sliding-glass door in the rear of the home and did a perimeter check of the property, which is when they found Ayers' neighbor Charles Shisler - a convicted felon who is not permitted to be in possession of a fire arm - in his backyard directly behind Ayers' property.

Authorities says Shisler has admitted to firing the shot while in his own home.

'The bullet traveled from within his residence, through his yard, 
through a wooded area that was probably 20 feet, through the back yard 
of the victim’s residence, through the sliding glass and across that 
residence,'  Major Tommy Ford of the Bay County Sheriff’s Office tells WMBB.

As of Wednesday, Shisler has been charged with manslaughter and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. However, police are still trying to figure out exactly what caused Shisler to discharge the weapon.

'We are trying to determine based on the forensic evidence and limited 
information that we have what truly occurred, what caused the shot,' Ford said.

Shisler's prior felony conviction stems from an incident in 2006, when he was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. But this isn't the first time police have been called to Shisler's home after a neighbor heard gunfire.

Police confirmed to WMBB that officers were dispatched to Shisler's home in March when a neighbor called to report hearing gun shots.

Police entered Shisler's home to investigate, but he convinced the officers that the sound came from fireworks. Police note that two people with Shisler also said the noise was caused by fireworks. No weapon was visible inside of Shisler's home, so the officer left without filing any charges.

Support: Ayers' friends say his family has a good support base and that it will be tough, but they will get through it

Meanwhile, friends of the aspiring musician are heartbroken.

'I had just gotten a picture of him and the baby which was just born 
father’s day,' close friend Scott Fryer told the station. 'The look on his face 
was just priceless, I was so happy for him.. So this is a real tough 
thing.'
