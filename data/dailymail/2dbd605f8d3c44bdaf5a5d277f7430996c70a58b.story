A 16-year-old boy who was driving a pickup truck that crashed and started a chain reaction of car crashes that ended up killing four people, has been charged in juvenile court with four counts of intoxication manslaughter.

Ethan Couch, of Keller, Texas, and seven friends had been drinking for hours before the June 15 wreck.

Some of them were even caught on surveillance video stealing two cases of beer from a nearby Walmart in the hours prior to the horrific accident.

Couch was also charged with two counts of intoxication assault, according to the Tarrant County district attorney’s office

Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash

Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup

The teen appeared with his lawyers yesterday afternoon for a detention hearing.

He was released to his parents on the 
condition that he wear an ankle monitor that allows officials to keep 
track of him.

The teen could face up to 20 years behind bars if convicted.

At around 11:45 p.m on June 15th, 
Couch and a group his friends who were all drunk, got into a red Ford 
F350 pick-up and were barreling down Burleson-Retta Road in southern 
Tarrant County when the truck left the road.

As it careered out of control, it 
clipped a broken down SUV, throwing the owner and four good Samaritans, 
who were trying to help, 60 yards in the air.

They were all killed on impact.

It was revealed soon after that 
Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - three times the limit - and that 
his truck was traveling up to 70 mph when it started the chain reaction 
of crashes.

The impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards, authorities reported.

Killed: Brian Jennings, 41, was parked on the side of the road when Ethan Couch's pickup truck drove into him and three others

Scene: 911 callers described cars everywhere and kids' lying in ditches' after the June 15 smash

Injured: Sergio Molina remains in a coma whilst Soliman Mohmand, right, was seriously injured. They were both riding in Couch's truck when the cash occured

Burleson youth minister Brian 
Jennings, 41; the SUV driver, Breanna Mitchell, 24, of Lillian; and 
Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were all killed.

Jennings, a Burleson youth minister, 
had stopped to help Mitchell, whose vehicle had a flat tire, and Boyles 
and her daughter had come out of their nearby house to assist. The SUV 
and all four victims were standing off the roadway.

The red pickup then hit Mr Jennings’ parked Silverado pickup with two boys inside.

Couch’s red pickup flew up into the air, flipped and crashed into a tree.

None of the teens in the red truck were wearing seat belts, investigators said.

They had earlier stolen a couple of 
cases of beer from a Walmart in Burleson about an hour before the crash 
and prior to that, they had tried unsuccessfully to buy alcohol at a 
convenience store.

The theft was recorded by store security cameras.

The group had only traveled two blocks when their speeding vehicle came off the road and clipped the broken-down SUV.

Tragic: Jennings, pictured second from left, was a father of three and a youth minister in Burleson

Crash: One of four vehicles involved in the crash was sent flying into a tree

Soliman Mohmand and Sergio Molina were seriously injured and remains in a coma with a traumatic brain injury.

His medical bills have exceeded $600,000 and could climb into the millions if Mr Molina needs permanent round-the-clock care

His parents are now suing Couch and his family for up to $20 million in a separate lawsuit.

The Silverado was pushed into a Volkswagen Beetle, which was being driven by Ashlyn Evans, 18.

She and her 14-year-old passenger were also injured.

Prosecutors chose not to pursue adult charges but to try the driver as a juvenile and to seek a ‘determinate sentence.’

That means the teen, if convicted, 
could start a prison sentence in a youth facility and, after age 19, 
complete it in an adult prison.

June's car crash wasn't the first time underage drinking had got Couch in trouble.

In February of this year, in the town Lakeside, northwest of Fort Worth, police found Couch with a 12-ounce can of beer and a 1.75-liter bottle of vodka in the early hours and gave him two citations - one for being a minor in possession of alcohol, the other for consuming alcohol as a minor.
