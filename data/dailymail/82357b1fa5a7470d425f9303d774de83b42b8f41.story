He's built a billion-dollar fortune with Facebook but its not just web surfing that attracts Mark Zuckerberg.

The social network founder, who is celebrating his first Christmas with wife Priscilla Chan after the couple tied the knot on May 19, laughed and joked during private surfing lessons on the island of Maui.

Mrs Zuckerberg looked slim and relaxed in a sporty, red one-piece while her billionaire husband lugged his own surfboard and worked on his tan in a pair of board shorts.

The 28-year-old took time out from his role as chairman and CEO of Facebook to relax with his 27-year-old wife on the Hawaiian island, a popular tourist spot for surfing and windsurfing.

The couple chatted easily with other beach-goers before taking to the waves, where Priscilla proved herself to be an accomplished surfer.

The Zuckerbergs married in May with a ceremony in the billionaire's backyard in Palo Alto, California. It was a joint celebration to mark Chan's graduation from medical school.

They honeymooned in Italy where they were pictured taking in the beauty of Rome's Sistine Chapel and tucking into pasta in low-key restaurants.Â 

The couple have been dating since 2003 after meeting in line for the bathroom at a frat party at Harvard University.

The beach snaps are a rare glimpse of a notoriously private couple - a luxury which was also accidentally breached by a member of Zuckerberg's own family last week.

His sister Randi posted a picture of her family 
jokingly reacting to Facebook's new Poke application, and someone 
Tweeted the picture out to the public.

She later complained that her privacy was breached on Twitter. The incident comes as Facebook has long been accused of taking advantage of users' privacy concerns.

In the photo, Randi's younger siblings and parents are seen in what appears to be their family home in Dobbs Ferry, New York.

Mark is standing in the corner- wearing his trademark hoodie sweatshirt and a bit of a smirk- while the other Zuckerbergs looks aghast at their cell phones, presumably mocking the latest update to the social networking application.

The new version of 'pokes' allow users to send fleeting messages, pokes, photos and ten-second videos to friends.

The messages expire after a set period of time, from 1 to ten seconds, and cannot be retrieved by either party again, making it perfect for sending salacious images without leaving a trail.
