This is what 1kg (2.2lb) of high-purity cocaine looks like, seized by police as the criminals that smuggled it into Britain are jailed for a total of 23 years.

The highly-addictive stimulant was found in the kitchen of a house in Ludworth, County Durham, next to weighing scales and latex gloves as the criminals prepared to sell it.

After being cut with other powders like baking soda, caffeine, or powdered milk to increase its weight, the group would have used the highly precise scales to divide the drugs into small plastic bags or paper wraps ready to be sold on the street.

David Thompson, 28, from North Shields, was jailed alongside brothers Robert Hall, 40, and Thomas Hall, 35, after all three admitted conspiracy to supply class A and B drugs between January 2012 and May this year.

Another 2.5kg (5.5lb) of cocaine was found at the same address, worth a total of £644,000, alongside 380 nine-ounce bars of cannabis resin, worth £402,000.

In a 'stash house' police found a further 27kg (60lb) of cannabis with Thompson's finger prints on.

The bars would either be sold whole or broken up into smaller lumps and sold as hashish, commonly known as hash.

Hashish is made from the resin of the female cannabis plant which is extracted by grinding up the leaves before pressing them into a hard block. Users then heat the drug, causing it to break apart, before mixing it with tobacco and rolling it into a cigarette, or smoking it in a pipe.

As with cocaine, unscrupulous dealers have been known to spray the plants with sand in order to increase their weight, and in 2008 around 30 people in Germany were poisoned after criminals mixed the class B drug with lead in order to make more profit.

Cocaine is usually broken down into 1gram wraps which sell for around £50, but statistics from the UK Forensic Science Service have shown purity levels dropping to new lows, with a up to a third of cocaine seized containing less than 9 per cent of the substance.

Heavy cannabis use is linked with developing schizophrenia in later life, and if mixed with tobacco can cause lung damage and cancer, especially as it is usually smoked unfiltered to increase its effects.

Cocaine has been linked with heart disease, with even moderate use leading to thickening of the heart muscles and major arteries leading to increase risk of heart attack and stroke, according to research.

Heavy use can also lead to paranoia, anxiety and panic attacks, and also wears away the cartilage in the middle of the nose, as with former EastEnders star Daniella Westbrook.

The gang were caught despite using a mixture of 'clean' and 'dirty' mobile phones to set up meetings and avoid detection.

Jailing the trio, Recorder Michael Slater said: 'I’m 
satisfied from what I’ve heard that this was a well-organised, extensive
and expertly put together drug-dealing operation supplying both cannabis
and cocaine to the North East and beyond.

'The rewards were extremely 
high, hence the amounts of drugs being supplied and the amount of money 
that was floating around.

'In the course of this ‘snap-shot’ of the operation, cannabis and cocaine with a total street value of £1m was recovered.'

As the head of the gang, Robert Hall was jailed for 13 years, while his brother, Thomas, was jailed for six years and Thompson was given four and a half years.

The owner of
the house the drugs were found in, Peter Samuel Davies, 65, and his newphew, Wayne Robson, 41, were 
jailed previously for five and seven years respectively for conspiracy 
to supply class A and B drugs.

Robert Hall, a father from Easington, was accused of using his paving company as a front for the drug enterprise, while Thompson, also a father, said he was using drug dealing as a way to better his family.

The gang are thought to have imported the drugs from Europe, though the cannabis is likely to have originated in North Africa or the Middle East, while cocaine is often smuggled from South America through Africa and into the UK.

Looks like: Tightly packed green leaves called 'buds', hard brown resin, or occasionally in oil form

Costs: Most commonly sold as 1/8 of an ounce for £20

Used: Can be rolled with tobacco and smoked, put into a pipe, vaporised with special equipment and inhaled or cooked into food and eaten

Effects: feeling of relaxation, drowsiness and happiness, often accompanied with fits of laughter. Also a strong urge to eat, often known as the 'munchies'.

Risks: schizophrenia, especially in those either already diagnosed with, or at risk from the condition. Lung cancer associated with smoking, a lack of motivation, and insomnia when use stops.

Looks like: White power

Costs: Typically £50 per gram, though as much as £90 for higher purity

Used: Usually snorted in lines, though can also be rolled and smoked.

Effects: Body high or 'buzz', feeling of alertness, mental clarity, and increased social skills.

Risks: Heart attack, seizure and stroke brought on by raised heart rate and thickening of heart muscle with repeated use. Also causes paranoia, anxiety or panic attacks. Often mixed with other potentially harmful substances which can be impossible to identify in the event of an overdose.
