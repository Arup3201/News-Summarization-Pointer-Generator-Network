Some of America's most familiar names are full of hidden meaning.

Whether is be the names of each of the 50 states to cities, countries, rivers, oceans and even mountain ranges, a map has been created with their etymological meanings.

And so New York becomes 'New Yew Tree Village', New Jersey is 'New Isle of Spears'  whilst Pennsylvania apparently means 'Land of the Main Hill Wood'.

Not all that it seems: It looks like a normal map, but once you start reading, it becomes clear that the 'Atlas of True Names' is not at all conventional

Some of the state names have meanings that are far easier to determine.

The map was designed by cartographers Stephan Hormes and Silke Peust.

Many of the meanings are literal descriptions of the terrain or climate of the places they describe.

Virginia means nothing more than 'Virgin Land' and neighbouring West Virginia predictably means 'West Virgin Land.'

Michigan, is the “Land of the Big Lakes', and Mississippi is the 'Land of the Great River.'

The Northeast: Who knew that Illinois meant 'Land of Those Who Speak Normally' or that Tennessee is 'Land of the River'

The Southeast: Florida is 'Blooming Land' which is understandable because of all the rain the state receives but can anyone explain 'Land of the Thicket Clearers' for Alabama?

Some
import European elements. Vermont's name is derived from the French 
word for Green (vert) and Mountain (mont) - hence it's nickname 'The 
Green Mountain State'.

Others utilise Native American Indian language. Massachusetts means 'Near the small big mountain' in an Algonquin language.

North and South Dakota are literal translations with 'Dakota' being the Sioux Indian Tribe word for 'friend' or 'ally'. The map names the states as the 'Land of Friends.'

Michigan means 'large lake' hence the map's creators gave the state the name 'Land of the Big Lake'.

'New York' is given as 'New Wild Boar Village' which is based on the idea that York in England derives from Old English eofor 'wild boar' and Latin vicus village.

However the meaning is open to interpretation because the Anglo-Saxon name Eoferwic was itself derived from folklore.

It meant 'place of yew trees' so New York could be interpreted as either a place 'boars' or 'yews'.

The true meaning: The map labels states, cities, and landmarks with the literal meanings of their official names

Further west, California means 'Land 
of the Successor', Nevada perhaps surprisingly is 'Snowy Land' whilst 
Arizona becomes 'Small Springs'.

Others are truly baffling; take Alabama's 'Land of the Thicket Clearers'

'Chicago' apparently means 'Stink Onions' - doesn't quite have the same charm as the 'Windy City' does it?

The map extends further afield to other countries too spawning some charming interpretations.

Cuba becomes the 'Place To Find Gold', whilst Mexico means 'The Naval of the Moon'.

The cartographers, Stephan Hormes and
his wife Silke Peust, say they were inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's maps 
of Middle Earth, which include names like 'Dead Marshes' and 'Mount 
Doom.'

Their world maps are filled with similarly descriptive toponyms. 'We wanted to let the Earth tells its own story,' says Stephan.

Northwest: There's no disputing Oregon's name as 'Beautiful Land' there's no wonder rainy Washington State is 'Marsh Farm Land'

Southwest: New Mexico is the poetically named 'New Navel of the Moon' and there's few who would dispute Texan hospitality with the state's meaning being 'Land of Friends'

'The names give you an insight into what the people saw when they first looked at a place, almost with the eyes of children. Through the maps, we wanted to show what they saw.'

Mr Hormes says that he included numerous caveats in the introduction to the atlas:

'Not all translations are definitive. The reader may be offered a number of possible alternatives, or the translation may be prefixed by ‘probably’ or ‘presumably’.

The atlas shouldn't replace a scientific work about etymology, it is meant as an invitation to the people to start looking at the world through fresh eyes.

If you're looking for mistakes, you'll always find some, even in ordnance survey maps.

Just take the Atlas of True Names as an idea to visualise the world of etymology to a broad audience at a glance. And these people haven't seen such a world before.'

'Atlas of True Names' is an etymological trip around the world.

The map makers researched global place names to find their origins, and then translated them to English

Most of the research for the names was done using books of etymology and the Internet
