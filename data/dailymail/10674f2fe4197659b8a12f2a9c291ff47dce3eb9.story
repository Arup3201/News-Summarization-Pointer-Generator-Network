A Fort Worth, Texas elementary school has come under fire from parents who claim certain teachers and administrators have cultivated a 'toxic' environment for their children.

At a Monday board meeting, parents turned out to support Kourtney Glaser, the former vice principal at Comanche Springs Elementary School in the Eagle Mountain-Saginaw Independent School District, who was placed on administrative leave after she experienced heavy vaginal bleeding that the school claims was caused by 'severe anxiety.'

Glaser, 31, and her doctors, have firmly stated the bleeding, which occurred during a district training session and required Glaser to seek immediate medical attention, was the result of an intrauterine device being lodged in her uterine wall.

This was just the beginning of the parents complaints as well, as they also voiced their concern over 'staff drinking,' the 'use of disparaging nicknames for teachers, parents and even children,' and a principal who has been reassigned after her 'bullying tactics.'

Once parents got wind of this news, many rallied behind Glasser, and seemed to place most of the blame on the principal, Katy Maurer (above in leopard print top)

According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Glaser was forced to go to the emergency room on January 28 when she began suddenly bleeding, and two days later had her device removed to stop the trauma.

She was not allowed to return to work however, and instead placed on leave after receiving a letter shortly after that said her bleeding had occurred on multiple occasions and was the result of 'severe anxiety.'

On top of this, she was told she would need to see two doctors and sign a waiver releasing her medical records before she would be allowed to return to work.

The letter also claimed she had trouble speaking in front of large groups, something Glasser denied in an interview with ABC 8. 

At this point, some parents at the school became aware of the situation, and seemed to place the blame on Katy Maurer, the principal of the school.

The situation then became even further complicated when just last week Maurer filed a police report claiming she was being harassed by an employee at the school and her husband.

The name of the employee was not released, but it was revealed to be someone who was on leave.

In her report, Maurer claimed this employee had posted 'very hateful things' about her on social media, and that these posts had led to national attention.

The employee also reportedly referred to Maurer as an 'idiot,' while the employee's husband is accused in the report of stalking Maurer, coming to the school unannounced, following her to restaurants, and showing up at her home.

Maurer, 34,said this has been going on for close to five weeks.

The district said it is examining the claims, while a lawyer for Glaser, Brittany Lannen, all but admitted she was the woman named in the report, saying; '“Once the aggressor is caught, they attempt to play the victim. Thankfully with today’s technology and social media, Ms. Maurer’s false accusations can easily be dismissed with a quick view of Mrs. Glaser’s social media.'

She also added that Glaser's husband was not ever told he could not be on school grounds.

Maurer, meanwhile, has been reassigned to another school in the district. 

'It was a very sad situation,' said retired teacher Carol Smith. “

Smith then said of Maurer; 'She was hired against the recommendation of the committee, and I felt like I was working with a person in the seventh grade.'

The district said it is investigating the leadership and these incidents at the school (above)

PTA member Jennifer Jordan said that Maurer tries to exercise too much control over how decisions are made at the school, claiming she 'has tried to remove PTA leaders, and has said she only wants people she likes on the board.'

There were also claims at Monday's meeting that Maurer had 'misused PTA travel funds for personal entertainment.'

'My daughter is stuck in a horrible situation at Comanche Springs,' said Chad Ferguson.

'I want my kids to grow up and feel like when something is not right, they have an obligation to try and make it right without fear of retribution.'

In a statement released last Friday, the district said; 'The administration of Eagle Mountain-Saginaw ISD is very aware of the concerns surrounding the leadership team at Comanche Springs Elementary, and is actively working toward a resolution.'
