A pregnant woman accused of pinning her - also pregnant – love rival with a car during an argument over the father of their unborn children, smiled and laughed after being charged in a Texas courthouse on Monday.

Shaeryll Hunter, 26, had been arrested earlier in the day after four days on the run since allegedly crushing Alise Kelley's legs with a car on March 28.

Ms Hunter has two children with Chris Chaney and is five months pregnant with their third child. 

Five months pregnant Shaeryll Hunter has been charged four days after she drove a car into her love rival, Alise Kelley, crushing her legs and forcing one of her feet to be amputated

When asked if the women were arguing over him, Chaney smiled and said: 'I mean, I am handsome'

Ms Kelley, Chaney’s new girlfriend, is also having his baby. She is four months pregnant.

Mr Chaney - who also has children by two other women - said the two women were arguing on the phone when Hunter got mad and drove to the house he shares with Kelley.

He told khou.com that he was in the house asleep when Hunter arrived at the property.

He
said the pair had been 'texting and talking over the phone saying they 
want to fight each other and meet up right here and do it.'

Mr Chaney said that when he came outside he saw Ms Hunter shouting that she wanted to fight Ms Kelly.

The police said Ms Hunter then jumped into his Lincoln car and put her foot down - pinning Ms Kelly, 21, against the house.

Pain: Witnesses said they could hear Ms Kelly screaming in agony after she was pinned against the wall

Witnesses
have spoken of hearing Ms Kelly screaming in agony after being hit by 
the vehicle and out of fear for her unborn child.

Both of her legs were broken during the incident and one of her feet had to be amputated. Her unborn baby survived the attack.

The force of the crash demolished a wall at the property. A shoe, apparently belonging to Ms Kelly, could be seen lying amongst the rubble.

Ms Hunter is then alleged to have sped off in Mr 
Chaney's Lincoln LS car.

Argument: The women rowed outside the home of Chris Chaney (pictured) who is the father of both unborn children, plus another four

Crash: Ms Kelly was badly injured in the horrifying incident. A shoe, apparently belonging to her, could be seen in the rubble

When asked if the two women were arguing over him, Mr Chaney - who has four kids and another two on the way - smiled and said: 'I mean, I am handsome.'

He wasn't the only person smiling over the ordeal.

Ms Hunter couldn't resist smiling and posing for the cameras in a Harris County courtroom on Monday evening.

She has been charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, a felony, and a misdemeanor case of failing to provide identification. Her bond was set at $30,000.
