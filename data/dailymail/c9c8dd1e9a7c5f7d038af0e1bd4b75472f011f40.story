The family and friends of  the the South African teacher killed during a botched US raid on al-Qaeda militants in Yemen paid their final respects at his funeral in Bloemfontein.

Pierre Korkie's tearful widow Yolande followed the flower-laden casket, which was carried by uniformed students from Grey College School where he had taught.

The 57-year-old teacher was killed in Yemen  during a botched US raid on al-Qaeda militants who were holding Korkie and American hostage Luke Somers.

The funeral has attended by U.S. Ambassador Patrick Gaspard after Korkie's widow, Yolande, invited him, the embassy said.

'If I had to take one message from the proceedings, it was forgiveness,' said Ali Sayed, spokesman for Gift of the Givers. 

The South African aid group had been negotiating for Korkie's release and said he was just hours from his freedom when US Navy SEALS  stormed into the compound where he and  Somers were being held. Somers was also killed in the raid.

But Yolande - who was kidnapped alongside her husband in Taiz in May 2013 - said the family had chosen to approach the tragedy with love and forgiveness.

'Today we choose to forgive,' she said. 'We choose to love. We choose to rejoice in the memories of Pierre and keep him alive in our hearts.'

'Even though the pain is overwhelming us right now, we choose to believe that this too shall pass.'

Yolande was released in January following mediation by the Gift of the Givers charity. 

She said: 'Although we were separated in the flesh after 228 days when I was released, I remained with him in spirit until the end.' 

The government of South Africa - like the United States - has a strict policy of not paying ransoms to terrorist groups holding their citizens, maintaining that payments encourage kidnappers and perpetuate the problem.

US president Barack Obama sanctioned the mission and secretary of state John Kerry cited 'a compelling indication that Luke's life was in immediate danger' and said 'we recommended that the president authorise an attempt to rescue Luke'.

Speaking in Afghanistan, defence secretary Chuck Hagel said the rescue operation was 'extremely well executed' but complicated and risky.

The Navy SEALs landed by helicopter six miles from the Al-Qaeda compound where the hostages were being held.

Speaking anonymously to the BBC, senior officials said 40 special forces soldiers, backed by Yemeni troops, advanced to within 100m of the site, but were spotted by a militant.

The terrorist was briefly seen running into the compound, which is likely to be when the hostages were shot. Mr Korkie died on a helicopter and Mr Somers died on board a US navy ship.

In a separate service at around the same time of Korkie's funeral, in the capital Pretoria mourners gathered to honor Werner Groenewald, an aid worker, and his teenage children, Jean-Pierre and Rode. 

They were killed November 29 when Taliban militants stormed the office of a foreign aid group in the Afghan capital, Kabul, where the family alived.

Groenewald's wife, Hannelie, a doctor who was not at the office when the attack occurred, was composed during the ceremony.

'She is incredibly strong,' said Teresa Conradie, the family's attorney.

In a symbolic gesture, a pastor lit three candles - one for each slain member of the Groenewald family - and blew them out.

The Groenewalds were buried at the same church where Werner Groenewald worked as a pastor before leaving for Afghanistan in 2002. The 46-year-old led the local activities of Partnership in Academics and Development, which has offices in Redlands, California.
