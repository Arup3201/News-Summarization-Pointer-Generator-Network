Making driving tests tougher could help ease traffic jams clogging up roads across Britain, MPs claim.

Members of the Commons Transport Committee say warning road users about impending congestion through real-time information systems could also be a cost-effective way to cut congestion.

They are trying to get a grip on the nation's traffic woes without building expensive new roads or introducing a 'pay as you drive' road pricing policy - which was scrapped by the Coalition government.

Tough: MPs think driving tests should be tougher to prevent road rage and ease congestion

The government estimates that the rising cost of congestion will cost the UK economy an extra £22billion by 2025.

Launching the report called Out of the Jam committee chairman Louise Ellman told the Daily Telegraph the committee thinks young drivers must have more experience of all types of road conditions before they sit their test.

She said: 'It's about having more responsible driving and not getting involved in bad behaviour and road rage.

'When the road narrows and two lanes converge into one people can start undertaking.'

She said bad driving can lead to road rage and to drivers not focusing on where they are going.

Ms Ellman said: 'Improving the way we manage road space so that the network runs more smoothly is vital to the prosperity of the nation. 

'More must be done to improve driver behaviour and road safety through better understanding of and adherence to the Highway Code.'

The driving test was introduced on March 13, 1935

When the test was brought there were only 1.5million registered vehicles

The year before the compulsory test was brought in, there were 7,000 people were killed as a result of road accidents. Introduced as a safety measure, it saw fatal and serious injuries fall by 17 per cent within three years.

Since its inception, the test has been adapted to reflect advances in car design and changing road layout.

Hand signals were removed in 1975 and a video hazard perception test introduced in 2002.

Since 1996, drivers have to pass the written Theory Test before they are able to take the practical driving test.

In October last year independent driving became part of the test.

She added: 'Much more can also be done to improve co-ordination between highway authorities and organisations undertaking street works to ensure local authorities use the best available technology to co-ordinate their road or traffic management activities with other highways authorities.'

Other ideas to cut down congestion included giving drivers access to a free Highway Code app for their phones and sending leaflets to drivers when they renew their licences.

The report also suggested drivers utilise the Traffic Programme button in their cars to get the latest congestion information.

The AA'S Edmund King told the newspaper junction improvements and traffic light phasing should have been considered by the committee.

He said a tougher driving test would do little to cut congestion.

Last year learner drivers were asked to drive 'independently' without getting instructions from the examiner.

The Driving Standards Agency said this allows the tester to look at whether the drivers can drive unsupervised.
