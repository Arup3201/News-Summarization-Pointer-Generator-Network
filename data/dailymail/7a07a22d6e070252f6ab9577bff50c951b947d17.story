The American executive who is still being held hostage at his company's factory outside of Beijing has been released after a compensation dispute was resolved, a company official and union representative said.

Chip Starnes, the president of 
Specialty Medical Supplies, in the Beijing suburb of Huairou, was 
allowed to leave the factory and is resting in a hotel, the company 
official said.

Workers had demanded severance 
packages identical to those offered to 30 employees who were recently 
laid off, even though the firm planned no further layoffs, Starnes said 
earlier.

On lockdown: Chip Starnes was held hostage in his factory outside of Beijing for the past six days

Getting his message out: He had been able to speak to several news 
outlets during the capture but not allowed off the grounds for 
fear that the workers will not be paid

'The mass labour dispute incident for
 this unit has been resolved,' said Chu Lixian, head of the rights and 
interests department of the Huairou District Labour Union.

'Both sides have come to an agreement
 through joint efforts made by Mr. Starnes and the workers' side. The 
results have turned out to be satisfactory.'

The workers' demands followed rumours
 that the entire plant was being closed after the company's plastic 
injection moulding division began a move to India to lower production 
costs.

'As of now my boss Chip feels exhausted after two harsh days and has gone back to a hotel, okay?'

Specialty Medical General Manager Xing Shuang told Reuters Television. 'This is all I have to say.'

Starnes spent the week inside the 
plant, which produces alcohol pads and plastic blood lancets for 
diabetics, behind barred windows. He could not be immediately reached 
for comment.

Starnes, whose company is based in Florida, flew to China on June 18 and his detention started on Friday.

Yesterday he was trying to make 
light of the situation and keep his spirits high when he was interviewed
 on American television this morning.

'I got shaved today, I was given an 
electric razor so I'm feeling pretty good today,' Starnes said from behind 
the caged windows of the Chinese factory.

'I decided I'm going to stick with the blue shirt all the way through, sort of like my little slogan thing.'

Missed: Starnes' wife said that they have spoken every day since he has been in captivity but that is not enough

Mr Starnes, a co-owner of Coral 
Springs, Florida-based Specialty Medical Supplies, said local officials 
had visited the 10-year-old plant on the capital's outskirts and coerced
 him into signing agreements Saturday to meet the workers' demands even 
though he sought to make clear that the remaining 100 workers weren't 
being laid off.

He told The Today Show that he has tried to leave the plant but his escape attempts have not worked.

He said that the conditions of his 
captivity were reasonable, with McDonalds and KFC getting delivered
 to him for breakfast and Chinese food with rice for lunch.

'They're hands off here- they let the workers handle it themselves,' he said of the local authorities.

'I did try and actually go over the gate but they would not let me go,' he said.

His wife told NBC that while they have been in contact, that is not enough for their family.

'I just want him home, his kids want him home. Every day we do get to talk to him but it's very upsetting,' she said.

The workers were expecting wire 
transfers by Tuesday, he said, adding that about 80 of them had been 
blocking every exit around the clock and depriving him of sleep by 
shining bright lights and banging on windows of his office.

Anguish: 'I feel like a trapped animal,' Mr Starnes said from his first-floor office window, while holding onto the window's bars

He declined to clarify the amount, saying he wanted to keep it confidential.

'I
 feel like a trapped animal,' Mr Starnes told The Associated Press on 
Monday from his first-floor office window, while holding onto the 
window's bars.

'I think 
it's inhumane what is going on right now. I have been in this area for 
10 years and created a lot of jobs and I would never have thought in my 
wildest imagination something like this would happen.'

Workers inside the compound, a pair 
of two-story buildings behind gates and hedges in the Huairou district 
of the northeastern Beijing suburbs, repeatedly declined requests for 
comment, saying they did not want to talk to foreign media.

It is not rare in China for managers 
to be held by workers demanding back pay or other benefits, often from 
their Chinese owners, though occasionally also involving foreign bosses.

The
 labor action reflects growing uneasiness among workers about their jobs
 amid China's slowing economic growth and the sense that growing labor 
costs make the country less attractive for some foreign-owned factories.
 The account about local officials coercing Starnes to meet workers' 
demands - if true - reflects how officials typically consider stifling 
unrest to be a priority.

Huairou district and Qiaozi township governments declined to comment.

Demands: Mr Starnes said that dozens of workers demanding severance packages like those given to co-workers in a phased-out department

Captive: An unidentified U.S. Embassy employee, left, and Chinese 
official walk outside the closed gate at Specialty Medical Supplies 
plant where Chip Starnes was being held hostage

Representatives from the 
U.S. Embassy stood outside the gate much of the day, and eventually were
 let in. U.S. Embassy spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said the two sides were 
on the verge of an agreement and that Starnes would have access to his 
attorneys.

It was unclear what agreement might be reached, and subsequent attempts to contact Starnes were not immediately successful.

Starnes
 said the company had gradually been winding down its plastics division,
 planning to move it to Mumbai, India. He arrived in Beijing last 
Tuesday to lay off the last 30 people. Some had been working there for 
up to nine years, so their compensation packages were 'pretty nice,' he 
said.

Some of the 
workers in the other divisions got wind of this, and, coupled with 
rumors that the whole plant was moving to India, started demanding 
similar severance packages on Friday.

Christian
 Murck, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he 
wasn't familiar with Starnes' case, but that such hostage-taking was 
'not a major problem' for the foreign business community.

'It happened more often say 15 years ago than today, but it still happens from time to time,' he said.

'It rarely leads to personal harm to the managers involved, but there are cases when it has in years past.'
