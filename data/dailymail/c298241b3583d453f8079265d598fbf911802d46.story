Staff at Ofsted have run up bills of nearly £4million at the taxpayer’s expense on luxury hotels and gourmet meals.

Spending covered by the quango’s credit cards included stays in a five-star resort in Cyprus, dining at some of London’s finest restaurants and drinking in champagne bars.

The watchdog, in charge of inspecting schools in England, disclosed the credit card bills under the Freedom of Information Act. They were run up by around 450 Ofsted officials and inspectors over the past five years.

Lap of luxury: The Colombia Beach Resort in Cyprus where Ofsted inspectors spent £1,109

Staff spent £1,108.72 at the five-star Columbia Beach Resort in Cyprus, which has a private beach and numbers celebrities including Kim Cattrall and Jack Dee among previous guests.

Ofsted said the stay was linked to the inspection of a British military school in Cyprus.

A bill for £5,297.97, plus £80.80 for dining, was run up in nine months at a private members’ club, the Royal Automobile Club in Pall Mall, London.

Further spending included £470.49 at Les Deux Salons, run by two Michelin-starred chefs, and £323.40 at the Gordon Ramsay-run Savoy Grill.

Ofsted said the bills were run up carrying out inspections, attending international conferences or on fact-finding missions, and include fuel and parking as well as meals and hotels.

It insisted that its policy is ‘very clear’ that alcohol cannot be claimed for. It added that £585 charged to a card during a stay at the Grand Hotel Aminta in Sorrento, Italy was a ‘personal transaction made in error’ and was repaid.

Details emerged at a turbulent time for Ofsted, which came under fire earlier this week with claims that its judgments were less reliable ‘than flipping a coin’.

Spending on its credit cards ballooned to £1.63million in 2009/10 before dropping to £501,154 in 2011/12, the figures show.

But the sums are creeping up again despite a pledge by David Cameron to crack down on spending on government-funded cards.

Ofsted’s credit card bill is expected to reach £727,963 for 2013/14, bringing the total for the past five years to £3.9million.

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Ofsted is meant to spend its time and budget inspecting schools, not on fine dining in the West End.

When its inspectors do have to travel they should stay in modest accommodation and certainly not five-star hotels or private members’ clubs.’

An Ofsted spokesman said: ‘Ofsted inspectors, by the nature of their work, spend a great deal of time away from home and the office.

'There are robust controls in place to ensure the strict rules governing business expense claims by our employees are adhered to. Our policy is very clear that alcohol cannot be claimed.’

The Policy Exchange think-tank claimed this week that Ofsted inspectors’ judgments were often unreliable, saying: ‘Ofsted needs to operate in an environment where... it can achieve more with less.’

Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw yesterday promised a series of reforms to the way the quango operates. These include shorter and more frequent school inspections, to raise confidence in its processes.

Thousands of schools face major disruption next week as teachers stage a national strike in a long-running dispute over pay and pensions.

More than half of schools across England and Wales are expected to operate reduced timetables or even close on Wednesday as members of the National Union of Teachers stage a one-day walkout.

Head teachers warned that many schools would be unable to open.
