Two Cold War missile sites that were readied for use when the world came to the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis have been given listed status.

The Thor missile site at the former RAF North Luffenham, Rutland, has been given a Grade II* listing, while the site at former RAF Harrington, Northamptonshire, has been listed at Grade II as a reminder of the 'knife-edge moment in history'.

The two sites are the most intact examples of Thor missile bases in England, with concrete launch pads and blast walls still remaining, along with mounting bolts for the platforms that would raise the missiles into a vertical firing position.

Historical importance: Former RAF North Luffenham, Rutland, which is one of two Cold War missile sites readied for use when the world came to the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis

The Government announced the sites were being protected on the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, which saw the two bases put on alert and their Thor missiles readied for a possible launch on the Soviet Union.

The crisis, in October 1962, saw the 
Soviet Union and the US on the brink of nuclear conflict after the 
Soviets sited armed nuclear weapons in Cuba.

Following 13 days in which the world 
held its breath, a deal was struck in which the Soviets would remove the
weapons and America would not invade Cuba.

The listing, which recognises the two sites' architectural and historic importance, comes on the advice of English Heritage and is part of an ongoing project to ensure the best Cold War structures are preserved.

A total of 60 Thor missiles, 
developed by the US, were deployed at 20 sites in the east of England 
from 1958 under the codename Project Emily.

They
were manned by the RAF, but their warheads remained under US control, 
and the decision to launch them would have been made jointly by the two 
countries.

RAF North Luffenham is now St George's Barracks, while RAF Harrington is now mainly farmland.

Dr
Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, said: 'The remains 
of the Cold War are fading from view faster than those of the world 
wars.

Named after the Norse god of thunder, 60 Thor missiles were deployed to Britain between 1959 and 1963.

Fearful that the Soviet Union would produce a ballistic missile first, the US began developing the long-range missile in January 1956.

Thor was the first operational ballistic missile deployed by the USAF, and the 65-foot weapon had a range of 1,500 miles.

The Thor missiles deployed to Britain were operated by 20 squadrons of the RAF Bomber Command.

'Our Cold War heritage is a complicated 
and not always easily loved collection of concrete bunkers and silos. 
But they are the castles and forts of the second half of the 20th 
century and we want to ensure that the best examples survive.

'These two missile sites are among the few physical reminders in this country of the Cuban missile crisis, a moment when the entire world held its breath.

'They deserve to be protected to remind present and future generations of this knife-edge moment in history.'

Heritage Minister Ed Vaizey added: 'Our Cold War heritage is often overlooked but it is an important reminder of a point in history and is worthy of protection.

'Listing these two missile sites is particularly poignant on the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis and serves as a very physical reminder of an uncertain and tense period where the world feared a nuclear war.'

English Heritage is holding a series of events to mark the 50th anniversary, including a programme of films, tours, talks and a photographic exhibition at the York Cold War bunker, and tours of secret tunnels beneath Dover Castle which would have housed government and military officials in the event of a nuclear attack.
