Clambering down from his tiny coffin-sized shack built into the steel girders of its huge frame, this is the man who lives in Manhattan Bridge.

Calling the New York City landmark home for the past year, he has managed to quietly come and go - while millions of oblivious commuters have rushed past his makeshift wooden home without a second thought or glance.

Emerging daily at dawn with only the odd cyclist or early morning subway rider for company, the man was only first-sighted recently - prompting a report of a suicide attempt as he safely climbed back into his home boxed in between the subway and bike lane.

Emerging: This is the man believed to be called 'Joey' who lives in Manhattan Bridge and was photographed leaving his makeshift home on Tuesday morning

Speaking heavily accented English, the man offered up his name as Joey and said that he had arrived in New York City 13-years previously from China.

Climbing down: The man - who is originally from China - has lived in the bridge in secret for the past year

When asked where he had lived in China before arriving in the United States, middle-aged Joey said that he had worked in Shanghai, but had left to try and find a better life in the United States.

Claiming to have suffered a financial loss through gambling, Joey said that for the past year he has called the Manhattan Bridge his home - constructing the base between the girders using wood discarded from nearby Chinatown.

Indeed, dotted around the shack built into the bridge are evidence of his shanty construction - wooden boards and used water bottles litter the area.

Joey said that there were others who 
lived in or near to the bridge - including one woman who had moved her 
worldly possessions off the cycling ramp to the entrance of of the famous structure finished in 1912.

Surprisingly 
well dressed for a man who lives in a bridge, Joey said that the brutal 
winter that New York and the nation just experienced was difficult to 
endure.

Left to his 
climb back into his home, Joey has said that he is working on a second 
shack just 15-feet up the ramp from his current abode.

Each of the cramped homes are around ten feet-by-one-and-a-half feet and seem to be protected with bike locks.

Good morning: The man makes his way down from his shack at dawn - to avoid the hundreds of thousands of people who use the bridge on a weekly basis

Discarded materials: Water bottles and wooden planks litter the area where 'Joey' has built his home in the Manhattan Bridge

Daylight: 'Joey' explains that he has been coming and going from the Manhattan Bridge for the past year - until a reported suicide attempt - which was in fact him climbing into his home - revealed him to New York

Home: After speaking for a moment - 'Joey' returned to his shack to replace his umbrella after it stopped raining

Admittedly the dwellings, narrow spaces just big enough for one person to lie down, are cramped, but they provide shelter for people who otherwise have to brave the elements.

The New York Post first reported on Sunday about a middle-aged Chinese man who was seen locking his plywood 'door' with a bicycle lock each morning and return for the evening to sleep.

To reach the dwelling, which is built into the bridge frame on the Manhattan side of the bridge, he climbs a chain-link fence.

Last Sunday a cyclst saw the man climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him for a jumper, calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending suicide.

Dwelling: This is 'Joey's home - seen in daylight in the Manhattan Bridge

Joey likely picked this spot because it is part of a short expanse of the bike path where there is a roof. There is also no roof over the pedestrian walkway.

'People are really desperate for 
places to stay. I say, if he’s not bothering anybody, he’s not bothering
 me. Leave him alone,' Marcha Johnson, a passerby riding her bike near 
the shantytown told the Post.

The pods are built into the underside of the upper deck of the bridge, below car traffic and above the subway.
