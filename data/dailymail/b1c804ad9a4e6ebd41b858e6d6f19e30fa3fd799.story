Three football fans on a 1,221 miles - 1,966 km - trek to see England at the World Cup have finally reached Brazil, having set off from Argentina two months ago.

The distance the charity trio are walking was chosen to tie-in with the year England won the World Cup - 1966.

Pete Johnston, 29, Adam Burns, 27 and David Bewick, 31, started their 96-day journey in Mendoza, on March 3, planning to reach Porto Alegre by June 12 when the competition starts.

The charity trio have walked 870 miles (1,400km) in just 67 days.

The group has been swelled by a stray dog – who joined them on their journey in Uruguay.

The black labrador - now dubbed Jefferson Ramsey Moore after the group’s favourite England players - started following the group in Uruguay and shows no sign of leaving the team before they reach the World Cup.

The loyal lab has been dogging the group for 220miles (350km) and has been given his own England shirt from the 1998 tournament.

They have named the dog after 1966 heroes Sir Alf Ramsey and Bobby Moore.

Adam said: ‘Jefferson began following us in the small town of Solis on the Uruguayan coast and at first we tried to get rid of him because he smelt like road kill.

‘When he was still there at the end of the day as we set up camp we refrained from feeding him as we knew that would make him continue to follow us and we didn't want to take him away from where he was from.

‘When we woke up the next day he was still there so we decided he was not in it for the food, he just wanted companionship.

‘That was three weeks ago and now he is a key part of the Walk to the World Cup team, we even modified a World Cup 98 shirt for him which he wears with pride.’

Jefferson has now covered more than 280 miles and the group managed to get him over the border into Brazil.

The boys hope to re-home their new best friend when they have completed the final 400 miles of their journey.

Adam said: ‘We are currently trying to find him a home in Porto Alegre and have some very positive leads, in fact we are taking Jefferson to two potential new homes to see how he gets on.

‘We are still open to offers from people who think they can give him a new home. I also haven't ruled out taking him back to Sydney with me, but according to a vet we spoke to he might be too old to fly.

Adam said: ‘Throughout the whole trip so far we've had many dogs follow us for a while.

‘By the end of the day when we went to set up our tent on the beach we'd grown quite fond of him.

‘When morale is really low and we've been walking through rain for seven hours, he will jump in a puddle and it'll give us a real needed boost.’

They have already completed a three-day trek through a desert and hope to raise £20,000 to help build a water well in an impoverished area of Brazil.
