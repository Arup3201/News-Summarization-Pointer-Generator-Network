Tax dodger: Malcolm McGowan spent ten years on the run before being captured in Valencia. He was released on bail and has absconded again

One of Britain’s most wanted tax fugitives, who was caught after a decade on the run, has absconded again after being released on bail by a Spanish court.

Cigarette smuggler Malcolm McGowan, 60, has been wanted by police since 2001, when he fled the country after being convicted of bringing £16million of cigarettes into Britain illegally.

A European arrest warrant was issued against him but it was not until December last year that he was arrested after police received a tip-off that he was living in Valencia, Spain.

But in a bizarre move, Nottingham-born McGowan was granted bail and is now on the run for a second time.

After his arrest by the paramilitary Civil Guard, McGowan appeared before Spain’s National Criminal Court and was sent to a top-security prison near Madrid.

Shortly afterwards, he was released on bail under Spanish holding laws and has not been seen since.

The blunder has been criticised by Nottingham East MP Chris Leslie, who said McGowan should never have been released.

The MP is planning to write to Foreign Minister William Hague to demand a review of how extradition cases are dealt with.

'Certainly the first thing that I would like to see is the treasury and the British Foreign Office talking in very firm terms with the Spanish authorities about why there’s a process that allowed bail to be granted in cases such as these,' he said.

'I would have thought that the European Union justice system should be that when one country has clearly got a right to have someone extradited to be jailed it will be sorted out without these sort of loopholes.

'It sounds to me like we do need the Foreign Office to speak to their Spanish counterparts urgently to close this particular loophole.'

McGowan was originally arrested in 2000, along with ten others, after customs officers intercepted containers carrying six million Superkings cigarettes in gypsum boards at Thamesport, in Kent.

Six days later, 3.3 million Embassy Number 1 cigarettes were seized from a lorry travelling from France to Dover.

McGowan was convicted of smuggling 24.3 million cigarettes, which would have attracted duty of £4million, into the UK from November 1999 to March 2000.

He was one of 20 criminals whose photos were released on Thursday by HMRC as part of a Government crackdown.

Former Home Office minister MP Vernon Coaker said: 'I think it’s certainly something that needs to be looked at and clearly on the face of it justice is not being served by the fact that someone wanted by us for so long and for such a serious crime has been released and then absconded.

'However difficult these things are it shouldn’t deter us from truing to do better and at the end of the day justice needs to be done.'
