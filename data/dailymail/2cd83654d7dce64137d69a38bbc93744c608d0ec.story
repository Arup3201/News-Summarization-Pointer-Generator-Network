Federal authorities have asked to speak with the wife of suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, her lawyer said.

Amato DeLuca also offered new details on Tsarnaev's movements in the days after the bombings, saying 'he was home' when his wife left for work on the last day she saw him alive.

Katherine Russell Tsarnaev learned her husband was a suspect by seeing it on TV, DeLuca told The Associated Press.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and his brother, Dzhokhar, 19, two ethnic Chechen brothers from southern Russia, are accused of planting two explosives near the marathon finish line Monday, killing three and injuring more than 180.

A motive remains unclear. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was still hospitalised.

Katherine Russell Tsarnaev did not speak to federal officials who came to her parents' home yesterday evening, where she has been staying since her husband was killed during a getaway attempt on Friday.

DeLuca said he spoke with the federal officials, but he would not offer further details. 'We're deciding what we want to do and how we want to approach this,' he said.

When asked whether anything seemed amiss to the wife following the bombings, DeLuca said, 'Not as far as I know.'

DeLuca said his client did not suspect her husband of anything.

He
 said she had been working 70 to 80 hours, seven days a week as a home 
health care aide. While she was at work, her husband cared for their 
toddler daughter, DeLuca said.

'When this allegedly was going on, she was working, and had been working all week to support her family,' he told the AP.

Katherine's
 awareness of her then husband's movements, thoughts and plans is under 
intense scrutiny as her relation to Tsarnaev and her proximity to both 
brothers makes her a key witness  - witting or otherwise.

In hiding: The Russell family home in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, where Katherine is staying

The eldest of three daughters, to 
emergency physician Dr Warren Russell and nurse Judith, she had an upbringing steeped in the values of family and education.

It was while a studying at Suffolk University, Boston, that she met Tsaraev, then a promising boxer and athlete.

It
 was during that time that she converted to Islam and her youthful priorities 
appear to have changed as she left in 2010 without graduating. 

By then her relationship with Tsaraev was intense. Not even his arrest for violently assaulting her in 2009 could change that.

According
 to Cambridge City Police Department reports of the incident which took 
place in July at the Massachusetts home she once shared with Tsarnaev, 
when interviewed she described Tsarnaev as ‘a very nice man.’

As it has already been revealed, Tsarnaev
 was on the FBI's radar during that time as they were asked to look into
 his potential links to extremist groups.

She was living with Tsarnaev when he travelled to Makhachkala in 2011 – a trip now attracting the interest of investigators trying to establish whether he met with Gaczhimurad Dolgatov at that time.

Dolgatov was a Dagestani jihadist who died in 2012 after a vicious stand-off with Russian security services.

DeLuca said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was off at college and she saw him 'not at all' at the apartment they shared with her mother-in-law.

Katherine Russell Tsarnaev was attending
 university in Boston when friends introduced her to her future husband 
at a nightclub, DeLuca added.

They dated on and off, then married in 2009 or 2010, he said.

She was raised Christian, but at some point after meeting Tamerlan Tsarnaev, she converted to Islam, he said.

When asked why she converted, he said, 'She believes in the tenets of Islam and of the Koran. She believes in God.'
