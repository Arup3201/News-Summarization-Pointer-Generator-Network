Forget lookie-likey this is a cookie-likey.

The hilarious creature may bear an uncanny resemblance to one of Britain's best loved children's characters, but it's not made of fur and it certainly doesn't eat biscuits.

In fact, this is a stove pipe sponge which is more likely to be found in warm Carribean waters than Sesame Street.

Cookie-likey: This familiar face is actually that of a sea creature called the stove pipe sponge

And although it's a chip off the old block for the permanently hungry puppet, this curious sea creature would much rather be eating plankton than anything with chocolate chips.

With its bulging 'eyes', wide mouth and blue appearance, the bizarre looking organism is a dead ringer for the famous Jim Henson puppet.

It was spotted by underwater photographer Mauricio Handler, while he was diving in off the Dutch Carribbean.

The real deal: The actual cookie monster first munched biscuits on our screens 1996 when he made his Sesame Street debut

Speaking of his chance encounter with the Sesame sponge, he said: 'I came across this unusual sponge configuration during a shoot on the Western tip of Curacao.

'It was clear that it was an unusual comical sponge and I was surprised no one had ever photographed it.

'I lit it from top and side to create a more human like appearance and voila.'
