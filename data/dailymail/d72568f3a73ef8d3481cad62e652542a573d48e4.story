Selfies usually seem like an exercise in narcissism.

But today thousands of women shared striking shots of themselves at their most vulnerable, make-up free.

And
 joining the campaign, the mother of former Towie star Maria Fowler took
 it a step further - by baring her reconstructed breasts.

Brave: Joining thousands of women, Maria Fowler's mother took a shot of her post-surgery scars in support

Joined in: Maria Fowler tweeted her own version, fake tanned but without make up

Sharing the photos on Twitter, Miss Fowler wrote: 'My brave mums (sic) no makeup pic for cancer awareness. Showing her reconstruction scars.'

The reality TV star and glamour model, 27, also shared her own, saying: 'Ok so if my mum can bare her scars. Here is my no makeup selfie nothing but my tan #FightCancer'.

She later tweeted: 'My mum said she hopes her picture gives hope to anyone fighting against cancer who may be feeling desolate'. 

The campaign was created as a bid to raise awareness and money for
 breast cancer.

The
 campaign, inspired by Ellen DeGeneres' Oscars selfie, encouraged women 
around the world to get sponsored to go to work or on a night out make 
up free.

Everyone from cancer survivors to men in full drag have been posting pictures in on Twitter and Facebook.

She later added that her mother hoped to inspire cancer sufferers who feel desolte

Celebrities 
including The Apprentice star Luisa Zissman also took part as people tweeted 
their images on Twitter followed by '#NoMakeUpSelfie'.

Cancer Research UK, while not affiliated with the #nomakeupselfie hashtag, are supporting it

However,
 to begin with the well meaning campaign seemed to have missed a big 
point because nobody appeared to be donating any money in support of 
those that had gone au natural.

Though
 nobody seems to know where the idea came from, the rule seemed to be 
that women post their picture and then nominate other female friends to 
do the same with all posting that the photos were to 'raise awareness of
 cancer' yet with no mention of donating any money.

It didn't take long for people to become a little bemused by the campaign - with many Facebook and Twitter users wondering what the point was if nobody was actually donating cold hard cash.

Luckily Cancer Research UK have now 
cottoned on to the campaign and those posting the selfies or nominating 
others to do so can now text the word BEAT to 70099 TO DONATE £3.

Carolan
 Davidge, director of communications at Cancer Research UK said: 'The 
#nomakeupselfie Twitter trend isn’t something Cancer Research UK started
 – but it’s great to see so many people getting involved to help raise 
awareness of cancer amongst their friends and family.

'If people would like to choose to support our work to beat cancer sooner, they can visit www.cruk.org.'

It's not known where or how the trend 
for using a no make-up selfie started this time around although last 
week author Laura Lippman caused an online storm with a similar campaign
 in support of actress Kim Novak and her appearance at the Oscars.

Now, following this new viral selfie campaign the Facebook group No Make Up Selfie For Cancer Awareness has more than 153,690 likes and hundreds of photo uploads.

Cancer
 survivor Deborah Ferguson from Liverpool submitted her photo to the 
Facebook group and agreed to have it published on MailOnline.

She
 said: 'Can I campaign on behalf of all neglected boobies please? Give 
them a check,  I did that's why I have such a big smile as am a survivor.'

Another participant, Abigail Spillman 
said: 'I think it is a fantastic way to raise awareness. Its only been 
going on since yesterday and already it is trending worldwide.

Sisters Natalie Kirby, left and Joanne Kirby, far right, posed make-up free. Joanne's daughter Charlotte also put in her support.

'Along with a #nomakeupselfie and a small donation (if you wish) is a massive help. Well done on using Facebook and Twitter for putting it to good use!'

Sophie Williams, who works for a PR firm, told MailOnline she posted her #nomakeupselfie and promises to donate 50p for each like she receives to Cancer Research UK.

Dancer Felixy Splits posted a fresh 
faced pic, and told MailOnline: 'Everyone knows someone who has suffered
 from this awful disease.

'It's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can. Make a difference and do something positive today.'

Katie Weir of Freya Lingerie also joined in.

Katie Weirwas nominated by her friend and by doing so she donated £5 to the charity

She told MailOnline: 'Through the recent nomination trend on Facebook it is easy to see the power of social media and how quickly posts can go viral.

'It is fantastic to see young women embracing their make-up free faces to raise awareness of breast cancer.

'I was nominated by my friend and by doing so I donated £5 to the charity which I wouldn't have done if I hadn't seen the status!'

And it's not just women who are 
getting in on the action. In solidarity, men too have com up with their 
own way of raising awareness - but they're slapping on the make-up.

Rachel Horkan submitted a photo of her 12-year-old little brother Zach in full make-up.

She
 wrote: '[He] decided to put the make-up on as us girls are taking it of 
all to help cancer awareness, so proud of him to do this at such a young
 age! Bless him lots of likes for this young man people xxx'

Social media users have taken the internet by storm posting no-makeup selfies

It has undoubtedly divided opinion, with some saying no makeup selfies are pointless

awareness.
