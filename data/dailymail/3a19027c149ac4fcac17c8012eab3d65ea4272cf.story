The final member of a 16-strong mob convicted of killing a 15-year-old schoolboy in an attack planned on Facebook was jailed for 11 years today.

Junior Bayode was 16 when he helped hunt down Sofyen Belamouadden, who was stabbed to death in front of hundreds of horrified rush hour commuters at Victoria Station in London.

Witnesses said the teenage victim was chased into the Tube station ticket hall in a scene likened to an 'infantry charge' and attacked with a terrifying arsenal of weapons including knives and a samurai sword.

Bayode, now 19, was one of those armed with a blade and was caught on CCTV surrounding the victim on the floor as he was hacked to death.

Jailed: Junior Bayode is the final defendant to be convicted in relation to the killing of 15-year-old Sofyen Belamouadden at Victoria Station in 2010, and was sent to prison for 11 years today

Violent: Mr Belamouadden died after suffering fatal wounds to his heart and right lung inflicted by weapons including this Samurai Sword recovered by police

Mr Belamouadden died after suffering fatal wounds to his heart and right lung on March 25, 2010.

Bayode was convicted of manslaughter at the conclusion of a trial last October, but a jury were unable to agree on a more serious charge of murder.

Judge Christopher Moss QC refused permission for a retrial and prosecutors lost an Appeal Court challenge.

Today, more than three years and three months after the killing, Bayode was formally acquitted of murder after the Crown offered no evidence and jailed.

Bayode was the twentieth suspect to go before the courts and the sixteenth to be convicted of his part in the killing.

Judge
Moss said he reduced Bayode’s sentence from 12 years to 11 years for 
manslaughter because he is suffering from lymphoma, although it is now 
in remission.

The judge 
added: ‘I have no doubt you travelled to Victoria expecting a violent 
confrontation which in fact took place and prepared to take part in it.

‘You
joined the group of killers, you set upon Sofyen as he lay helpless and
defenceless on the floor of the ticket hall. It is said that you were 
yourself armed with a knife.

‘The
killing of Sofyen Belamouadden took place in dreadful circumstances in a
public place. You played your part in the death and you stand convicted
of his manslaughter.’

Bayode was also sentenced to seven years for conspiracy to cause GBH.

His conviction came at the conclusion 
of a series of five trials spanning nearly two years and comprising the 
biggest case the Crown Prosecution Service has ever dealt with.

Fifteen others have already been jailed for a total of 129 years.

The massacre had been planned the 
night before using Facebook and - in a chilling foreshadow of the 2011 
London riots - the instant messaging feature on the killers’ BlackBerry 
mobile phones.

Det Ch 
Insp John McFarlane from Scotland Yard's Homicide and Serious Crime 
Command, said: ‘Had it not been for social media - for BlackBerry 
messaging, Facebook and telephone usage - they wouldn’t have been able 
to organise and get the weapons and numbers and the situation would have
been able to defuse.

‘A quarter of a mile from Buckingham Palace, 
half a mile from Scotland Yard and at one of the busiest railway 
stations in the country in front of hundreds and hundreds of 
eyewitnesses they are brandishing weapons and carrying out extreme 
violence.

‘The didn’t think about the consequences.’

Mr Belamouadden’s
murder was the result of ‘simmering tensions’ between pupils at St 
Charles Sixth Form College in Ladbroke Grove, west London, and teenagers
from Henry Compton School in Fulham, where Sofyen was studying.

His
attackers used a £3.99 five-piece knife set bought from Argos, as well 
as batons, iron bars and a Samurai sword in an act of ‘indescribable 
aggression’.

This ferocious attack was captured on CCTV inside the station and showed the teenager being knocked to the floor and set upon.

The
attacking group, many of whom wore a single glove on their left hand to
identify themselves, thought of the station as their territory.

Facebook
was used to recruit troops and weapons, with one attacker asking online
friends for a ‘flick-up ting’ and asking an older friend to ‘buy some 
nanks from Argos’, referring to a box set of kitchen knives.

Others,
who communicated by BlackBerry Messenger and text message, talked about
the ‘madness’ that was going to unfold the next day.

Victoria
Osoteku, who had then just turned 18, bought the weapons from a branch 
of the chain store the following day, alongside pastor’s son Femi 
Oderinwale, 19.

Osoteku,
now 20, and Oderinwale, along with Adonis Akra and Samuel Roberts, both
19, were each jailed for 12 years after they were convicted of 
manslaughter in a series of five trials spanning nearly two years.

The
police presence at the station had been stepped up following an 
assault the previous day, but officers were unable to prevent the 
ferocious violence that followed.

Witnesses said the attacking group had
a ‘pack mentality, a collective sense of common purpose, as though they
were a team’ and used an ‘indescribable’ level of aggression.

Sofyen
and his friends tried to flee, but he made a ‘fatal mistake’ and headed
into the Tube station ticket hall where he was surrounded and stabbed 
at least nine times.

Samson
Odegbune, now 19, was seen brandishing a ‘Japanese-style sword’ with a 
blade up to a foot long during the chase, during which he told his 
victim: ‘I’m going to f*** you up.’

He had bragged on Facebook the previous night: ‘I will bring my Samurai’.

CCTV: Already jailed Samson Odegbune was seen brandishing a 'Japanese-style sword' with a blade up to a foot long during the chase, during which he told his victim: 'I'm going to f*** you up'

He was on bail at the time of the killing after he was arrested as part of a gang who had been brandishing a similar sword on a bus - though he was never charged.

Odegbune, along with Christopher Omoregie, also 19, and Obi Nwokeh, 20, were each sentenced to detention at Her Majesty’s pleasure - the juvenile equivalent of a life sentence - with a minimum term of 18 years after they were convicted of Sofyen’s murder. Odegbune’s minimum term was later reduced to 16 years by the Court of Appeal.

Odegbune did not attack Sofyen but instead led others who chased the victim’s friends away from the station.

Following the attack 12 of the 20 suspects boarded a bus and appeared ‘hyper’ and ‘pumped up’ to other passengers. One of them was overheard telling a friend: ‘Didn’t you see me run in to the station and shank him?’

Murderers (from left to right): Obi Nwokeh, 19, Christopher Omoregrie, 
18, and Samson Odegbune, 18, were all given a life sentence and told 
they must serve a minimum of 18 years

Police officers stopped the bus and found a selection of knives as well as blade-sharpening steels and a schoolbag.

Other bloodied knives were found in a knife amnesty bin on Victoria Street.

Before officers boarded, one of the youths passed a knife covered in a cardboard sheath to a young mum.

She later took the weapon home, 
cleaned it and disposed of it but police were able to recover it after 
she reported the incident.

Enoach Amoah, 19, and Tyrone Richards, 17, were jailed for seven years after they were found guilty of violent disorder.

Femi Oderinwale, 18, were found guilty of manslaughter and given 12 
years detention each

Amoah, 19 (right) were found guilty of conspiracy to commit GBH and were
sentenced to seven years detention

Chris Goncalves and Tayo Ajayi, now both 20, received two-and-a-half year jail terms after they were convicted of the same charge.

But Ajayi walked free from court to begin studying for a degree in sports coaching, having served the equivalent of 464 days on remand.

Amarl Wood, 18, was locked up for 27 months after he was found guilty of an identical charge.

He had to serve just 11 days behind bars following his conviction and was allowed to work as a steward at the 2012 Olympics.

Lewis Sinclair, Olawale Olaribigbe, Melvin Mensah, Selassie Ahiaku, all now 19, all got two years after they pleaded guilty to violent disorder before their trial got underway in September 2011.
