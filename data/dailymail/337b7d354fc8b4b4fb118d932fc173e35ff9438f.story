Utah is the nerdiest place to be in the US - and Washington, D.C. is the least, according to a new study.

Real estate search engine Estately analyzed Facebook users' data to see which percentage of users said on their profiles that they were interested in 12 criteria.

These included Star Trek: The Next Generation, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Doctor Who and Lord of the Rings, as well as general categories for 'Anime Movies,' 'Comic Books' and 'Fantasy Lit.'

Users' interest in Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering were also considered, as well as live-action role-playing (LARPing) and cosplay, which involves dressing up as particular characters.

The numbers in the study show the 'overall rank for per capita interest' in each subject, the site says.

Sci-fi and fantasy lovers will find themselves in 'nerd heaven' in mainly Pacific Northwest and Mountain states.

Utah is the nerdiest state, holding 
number-one per capita interests in cosplay, Harry Potter, Star Wars, 
LARPing, fantasy literature and Lord of the Rings.

'In
 Utah, nerdishness is so common it’s practically the norm,' Estately 
says. 'Even if you factor in its high percentage of young people, Utah’s
 enthusiasm for nerdy interests is unparalleled in America.'

In descending order, the top ten states are Utah, Alaska, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado, Washington, Kentucky, Oregon, New Mexico and West Virginia.

The second-nerdiest state is Alaska, which has the highest per capita interest in Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering. It also holds the number-two slot for interest in anime movies.

'In Alaska, if you’re standing on a street corner and the person to your left isn’t a Dungeon Master, and the person to your right isn’t, then you must be the Dungeon Master,' the site says.

The ten least nerdy places in the US include Washington, D.C., Mississippi, New Jersey, Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts, South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana.

The nation's capital has the lowest interest overall in nine out of twelve categories, including cosplay, Star Wars, LARPing and Doctor Who.

'If you want to get stuffed in a locker bring your Pokemon cards to school in Mississippi, New Jersey, or Washington, DC,' the site warns.

Those states are part of a larger 'nerd hell' which includes New York, Connecticut, Delaware and South Dakota, whose Facebook users showed little interest in nerdy pursuits.
