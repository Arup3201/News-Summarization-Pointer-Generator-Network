Little did Barbara Ehrhart know that almost 65 years after she was escorted down the aisle, her wedding would still be talked about as having one of the most outrageous themes ever seen.

These photos show how everything about her marriage to groom Fred in 1947 in Turlock, California, was related to Thanksgiving, with her wedding gown exclusively made out of turkey feathers.

Mrs Ehrhart collected 34,000 white plumes from 300 turkeys over several months to construct her dress and others for her bridesmaids. One gown was worth nearly $175,000 in today’s money.

The ceremony was caught on camera by 
Life magazine at the time and is still talked about decades later by 
wedding planners as having one of the quirkiest and most eccentric themes 
ever seen.

She made the 
bridesmaids' dresses out of feathers dyed black, yellow and green, 
reported Life. The article said said that by the end of the wedding, 
‘everyone was turkey-tired but Barbara’.

George
Dock Jr, president of bird protection group New York Audubon Society, 
wrote at the time in disgust: ‘Life has dealt a noble blow for wild-bird
protection by publishing these appalling pictures.’

But she hit back, saying she only collected feathers from wild birds who were dead or fatally injured.
