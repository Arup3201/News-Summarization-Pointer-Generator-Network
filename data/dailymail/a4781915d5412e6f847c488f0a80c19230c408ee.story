An aspiring actress trying to pursue her dream of a show business career in Las Vegas has revealed her secret past as a telephone psychic.

Despite telling her boss she had no mystical qualities, Erin Auerbach took a job as a tarot reader for customers who paid to listen to her predictions on a premium phone line.

What had seemed like a fun and easy way to make money soon became an emotional burden however, as Auerbach fielded calls from perverts, angry skeptics and lonely clients reaching out for human comfort and some hope.

Mystic: Erin Auerbach took a job as a telephone psychic while studying in Las Vegas

Auerbach had been desperate for work while she studied theater at UNLV when she spotted a classified advert for 'phone actors'.

Intrigued by the promise of working from home and setting her own hours, the 38-year-old decided to get in touch.

'Could it be true? Or was this some sort 
of telemarketing scheme?' Auerbach wrote in Salon. 'I called the number. A friendly man assured me 
that this was completely legit.'

Lured by the promise of $7 an hour, rising to $15 for 'psychics' who racked up the most calls, Auerbach decided to give it a go, but there was just one problem.

'The thing is, I’m not sure that I’m psychic,' she admitted at a training session, but was reassured that all she would need was a professional name and a pack of tarot cards.

The main purpose was to keep clients, who paid $5 a minute, on the phone for as long as possible.

After reinventing herself as Anita - the name of the hospice nurse who had cared for Auerbach's father after his liver transplant - the aspiring actress was ready for her first call.

Psychic phone line: Erin was employed to do tarot readings for callers

'About half of the callers were on to 
me immediately. They would tell me that they thought this was nonsense 
and that I was a fraud. The first surly customer I encountered pummeled 
me,' Auerbach wrote in Salon.

As the male caller's voice became more angry, Auerbach did her best to keep to the script and keep him on the line.

'I’m
 shuffling my tarot cards. Now ask me a question,
 and we’ll see if they can give you some of the answers you’re looking 
for?,' she told him.

'OK, genius. What’s my wife’s name?' he replied before hanging up.

The abrupt end to the call panicked Auerbach who had been warned if not enough calls lasted for an average of 10 minutes, she would be fired.

Auerbach soon found a way to relate to clients, reassuring them that love - or that big career break - was just around the corner.

While playing the part of Anita was difficult for Auerbach, one of her actor friends who worked for a different company, was relishing in his role.

'He thoroughly enjoyed perpetrating a fraud,' she said. 'He started each call by saying that he just drank a vial of lamb's blood to give him fortune-telling superpowers.'

And although he admitted many people didn't believe him, it made for a light-hearted conversation that kept clients on the phone.

Rather than making clients laugh, Auerbach's psychic hotline became a place where the lonely would talk about their problems sometimes for an entire hour.

One example was a woman named Judy who called in the middle of the night. By the end of the call Auerbach knew all about her dead husband and ungrateful children.

'I predicted 
that she would travel and meet a new soul mate. Judy laughed a lot, 
cried a little and paid $300 for the privilege of speaking to me,' Auerbach admitted.

'Those folks really didn’t give a damn about 
psychics or readings. They just wanted to talk to a friendly voice,' she added. 'Some
 people had terrible problems and cried a lot.'

Auerbach did her best to keep calls from those in serious despair short, giving clients toll free helplines to contact instead.

As well as the lonely, and the angry skeptics who would call up just to shout at her, Auerbach encountered several men under the impression that all premium rate phone lines served the same purpose.

While these dodgy callers panted down the phone, asking if she knew what they were doing, Auerbach would continue with the tarot reading until meeting her ten-minute target.

After that, she would end the reading and say 'Oh yeah, I know what you're doing.' And, when they asked what she thought about it, she would reply: 'Fine by me. You’re the one who’s getting screwed.'

Her future as a telephone tarot reader was cut short thanks to a mysterious stranger from Alaska who had called for advice and unwittingly gave Auerbach the help she needed to see a new future for herself.

The 18-year-old had wanted to know whether he should enlist in the military to help pay for college. As he talked about his parents' death and longing to find a place where he would fit in, Auerbach found herself relating to his plight.

Chance encounter: A phone call from a young man desperate to fit in made Erin realize she couldn't continue as a telephone psychic

'My 
stomach hurt. I identified with his uncertainty, his searching for a 
place to fit in, and his desire to escape, but I had a safety net. He 
didn’t,' Auerbach said.

'That’s when it occurred to me that I had no business trying to 
guide anybody’s major life decisions. I had enough trouble with my own.'

When he asked what the cards were saying to do, Auerbach told him she couldn't help and suggested he went to family and friends for advice.

The encounter made her end the young man's call and vow to never work as a phone psychic again.
