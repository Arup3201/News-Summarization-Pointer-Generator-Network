Cigarettes will be sold in plain packaging by May 2015 following an astonishing double U-turn by David Cameron.

Ministers today battled to insist they were not 'playing catch-up' as Labour claimed the government had only acted after being faced with the prospect of a major defeat in the House of Lords.

Now new laws are to be rushed forward so that a ban on branded packets can be introduced before the next general election, ahead of a review of the evidence from Australia, the first country to impose plain packaging.

U-turn: Britain is to follow Australia, which became the first country to pass laws forcing cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging

Just four months ago the Prime Minister angered health campaigners by dropping a promise to introduce a ban.

Amid a sense of chaos, Downing Street over-ruled the Department of Health to insist the plans would not go ahead.

It prompted Labour leader Ed Miliband to accuse Mr Cameron of being the 'Prime Minister for Benson and Hedge Funds'.

Campaigners believe plain packaging will make cigarettes less attractive to smokers, particularly the young.

Ministers are to rush through laws giving power to copy Australia where cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking

They were backed by then-health minister Anna Soubry who admitted  ‘gorgeous’ cigarette packets persuaded her to take up smoking as a ‘symbol of glamour’.

And one study in Australia found that those buying cigarettes in unbranded brown packets were 81 per cent more likely to consider quitting. 

Now the government has asked paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler to carry out a review of the evidence, which will be completed by March.

The move is also designed to defuse a toxic row about the influence of Mr Cameron’s controversial strategy chief Lynton Crosby. 

The Prime Minister was dogged by questions about lobbying when he blocked plans by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt for a ban in July – because Mr Crosby’s firm works for tobacco giant Philip Morris.

Nick Clegg today admitted he had broken another promise: he has not given up smoking.

Two years ago he announced he had given up his ‘evening fags’ because he wanted to be able  to out-run his three sons when they are teenagers.

But challenged over his pledge as the government announced plans for plain cigarette packaging, Mr Clegg admitted he had suffered a lapse.

‘I’m trying to be a little less categorical.  I do lapse from time to time, but my smoking habit is much, much more under control than it ever was.

‘I don’t every day, it’s much, much less. But, what I’m not going to pretend is that I will never ever smoke a cigarette again in my life, because I suspect I might well.’

He said he started smoking in his early teens, but suggested peer pressure played a bigger part than packaging. 

He added: ‘My memory is actually that it was so much to do with peer pressure, it was all the boys and girls in my year were smoking, and just holding out from that.

‘Now, what the evidence does appear to suggest is that one of the things that drives…it’s not the only thing, but one of the things that drives, is the kind of glamour with which cigarette packages are presented and marketed.

‘If the evidence shows as the emerging evidence appears to show that this would make a difference, then we as a government of course will take that step.’

His about-turn came shortly after it 
emerged Mr Crosby had told him to ‘get the barnacles off the boat’ – a 
reference to dumping controversial policies ahead of the election.

Mr
Cameron denied being lobbied directly by his elections adviser but 
refused to say whether the two men had discussed the issue.

Public health minister Jane Ellison said accused Labour of being 'rather miserable' for suggesting that the Government was merely trying to avoid a defeat in the Lords, where a vote on the issue is due shortly.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'People do feel strongly, and quite rightly, This is fundamentally about children's health.

'We know that two-thirds of people start smoking when they are children.

'It is quite a complex area of policy and we know from the Australian experience that it is quite controversial.

It is a quick review, we've asked Sir Cyril to report by March, to have a look, to take that independent view, to step back from the politics of this and to survey the evidence for us.

'I think that is a sensible next step in making policy in this area.'

But Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'If the Government were serious it would be taking action now to cut the harm from tobacco to children.

'Instead, we’ve got another review and why have we got this announcement now?

'It’s because the Government was on the verge of losing a vote in the House of Lords in the next couple of weeks.

'So, I don’t believe this is a serious move that they’ve now converted to the cause and I’m afraid it’s just a tactic to avoid humiliation in the House of Lords.'

Health campaigners had urged the government to follow Australia which this year became the only country to adopt plain packaging, all cigarette packs are drab green.

Research suggests non-smokers and young people find less appealing.

A Government source said the move to ban branded packets would put a stop to claims from the opposition about Mr Cameron being in hoc to the tobacco lobby: ‘This will nail Labour’s ridiculous smears. Now the pressure will be on Labour to get behind this amendment to enable the introduction of standardised packaging.’

But health sources insisted that months of internal wrangling and continued pressure from campaigners, also played a part in the decision.

In July, ministers said they were  shelving the proposed ban because of insufficient evidence that it would work.

There were also fears that the Government will become embroiled in a long and costly legal dispute with the tobacco industry, which argues that a ban would be illegal.

A ban is also opposed by many Tories, who view it as nanny state interference.

A health source last night said: ‘We always said we would look at the emerging evidence and this is the earliest opportunity to do it.’

Cigarettes have already been banned from being displayed on view in shops, and are instead sold under the counter

Smoking causes over 100,000 deaths every year in the UK and the Policy Exchange think tank has estimated it costs society £14billion.

Despite a huge reduction in the numbers since the 1950s, it is  estimated that one in five Britons still smoke.

The move was welcomed by health campaigners today. Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: 'Stopping cigarettes being marketed to children as a glamorous and desirable accessory is one of the greatest gifts we can give the next generation.

'If this becomes law next year there is no question that it will save thousands of lives in the future.'

Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'This is an early Christmas present for all of the campaigners that have been working tirelessly to save young lives.'

But Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: 'This could potentially be a very disappointing U-turn by the Government.

'Plain packaging will have a negligible impact on health, will boost the black market, and do enormous harm to small businesses.

'In the words of David Cameron, let's treat adults like adults and give them more responsibility over their own lives.'
