Tory MP Charles Walker said it would be 'extremely unpopular' but he would take the pay rise

Tory backbencher Charles Walker today became the first MP to say he would accept a controversial 11 per cent pay rise.

The
 MP for Broxbourne acknowledged that his remarks would be extremely 
unpopular but he had never turned down a pay rise before and I don't 
intend to start any time soon'.

It came as it emerged MPs and ministers could still pocket the inflation-busting pay hike as the main party’s rowed back 
from vowing not to accept it.

Downing Street refused to say that David Cameron would not accept the £7,600 hike recommended by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority.

And the Labour party was forced to deny reports it was planning to block all of its MPs from accepting the salary rise in a ‘cost of living’ stunt.

Instead Ed Miliband called for cross-party talks to stop the idea going ahead.

IPSA is expected to ignore public anger to confirm this week that announce salaries for MPs should rise to £74,000 from 2015.

The dramatic rise will leave MPs earning roughly three times the national average salary and comes at a time when most other public sector workers have had pay rises capped at just one per cent.

All the main party leaders have rounded on Ipsa for ignoring the public mood when recommending the rise.

But there is chaos in each of the main parties about whether or not they will accept the extra money.

Mr Walker claimed MPs were being treated as 'cannon fodder' in the row and the public did not want MPs setting their own pay rates.

He told Sky News: 'This is going to make me extremely unpopular and my inbox is going to fill up with hate mail.

'I have been a professional for 25 years and I’ve never turned a pay rise down in my life and I don’t intend to start any time soon.

'And I’m not going to turn the pay rise down because I don’t want my constituents thinking they’ve either elected a millionaire to represent them, or a saint. I am a flawed human being with many deficiencies, but I will be accepting the pay rise.'

He said the public did not want MPs to set their own pay: 'What my constituents told me and what the media told me is that they didn’t want Members of Parliament anywhere near their pay, and this is the consequence of that.

'Now, of course, if the Prime Minister and leader of the opposition don’t like what is being proposed, they can scrap IPSA but then we’ll end up where we were before, which is Members of Parliament – or perhaps, even worse, the Prime Minister – deciding on what we’re paid.'

Worth it: An opinion poll revealed people in every part of the country thought MPs should earn less than their current salary of £65,738, with Scots suggesting just £50,110

Austerity: More than eight in 10 people said MPs should have a pay freeze or cut and less than a third thought MPs worked hard

Many people have been left baffled by the sight of MPs claiming they do not want a pay rise - but doing nothing to stop it.

The bizarre situation can be traced back to the 2009 expenses scandal.

MPs
 pay had barely increased for many years, but perks to claim everything 
from taxis and food to furniture and home improvements became more and 
more generous.

But the 
scale of expenses abuse was revealed, MPs handed the right to decide 
their pay and allowances to the new Independent Parliamentary Standards 
Authority.

The move was intended to take the issue out of the arena of political controversy.

But
 Ipsa has largely ignored warnings from party leaders not to push 
through a steep pay rise at a time when most people have seen wages 
squeezed.

In an 
anonymous survey conducted by Ipsa earlier this year, MPs suggested that
 they should be paid an average of £86,250, with one-fifth of those 
questioned saying they should get £95,000 or more.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond 
yesterday warned ‘this is not the moment’ for a big pay rise and 
suggested the Cabinet would collectively vote to refuse it.

But today Downing Street left the door open for the rise to go ahead, and suggested a decision might not be made for two years.

Asked
 whether the Prime Minister would accept the rise, Mr Cameron's official
 spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: ‘I don't believe 
Ipsa have made a formal proposal yet. Any proposal that they make will 
be reviewed in mid-2015.

‘The Prime Minister's long-standing position is that the cost of politics should go down, not up.

‘He doesn't think that MPs' pay should go up while public sector pay is being restrained.’

Asked
 if the Prime Minister continued to have confidence in Ipsa, the 
spokesman said: ‘He thinks that it was right for Parliament to come 
together and make the decisions that it took with regards to making pay 
independent.’

Meanwhile Labour has been forced to deny rumours that party leader Ed Miliband was planning to announce that 257 of his MPs would refuse to accept the rise.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘It is right that MPs' pay is now set by IPSA. IPSA's proposals are not out until Thursday and when we receive them we will study them. In any case they will be reviewed in 2015.

‘We have always said that any decision on MPs' pay must be taken in the light of the current economic situation and the cost-of-living crisis facing families up and down Britain.’

Mr Miliband later called on David Cameron and Nick Clegg to enter talks on stopping the rise.

He said: 'If the package of proposals being set out by Ipsa is as reported it cannot go ahead.'

Labour MP John Mann today tabelled a 
motion warning against a pay rise at a time when public sector workers 
face a freeze or a cap on wages.

He said: 'It is nonsense to suggest that if MPs are not given this pay increase we will lose ‘talent’ to other professions.

'MPs should not be doing the job for the salary – I certainly did not check the salary before deciding to stand for Parliament.

'MPs’
 pay should rise in line with public sector workers. Anything more would
 send the message that MPs are out of touch with the rest of the 
country, and are not prepared to live by the rules they set for their 
constituents.'

Against: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told Andrew Marr he will not take the money

Also unhappy: Labour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have also blasted the figure

Labour’s shadow chancellor Ed Balls has branded the idea of a pay rise ‘preposterous’.

He said Ipsa appeared to have come to its conclusions ‘entirely out of any context of the real world’.

However
 former Labour home secretary Jack Straw said that while there is ‘never
 a good time to increase MPs' pay’ refusing to do so would unfairly 
deter ‘people from modest backgrounds’ from entering Parliament.

Several MPs including shadow health secretary Andy Burnham and Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said they would forego the pay rise.

Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the public would find it ‘utterly incomprehensible’ if Ipsa defied concerted calls from Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Nick Clegg to show restraint.

Tory MP David Ruffley said: ‘It is an inconvenient truth that MPs’ pay has fallen behind other equivalent occupations for some years, such as the judiciary.’

But there was also anger that Cabinet ministers like Mr Hammond, who earns £134,000 a year and made millions from business, are expected to call on MPs not to take their pay rise.

One Tory MP said: ‘It’s easy for ministers to tell the rest of us not to take the money when some of them are paid more than twice what backbenchers get.’ 

Sources close to Ipsa said the package would be cost-neutral, with pensions cuts paying for the higher salary.

But short of passing a law to abolish Ipsa, it won’t be possible to hand back the money. One insider stressed: ‘They’ll get the money. What they choose to do with it is a matter for them.’
