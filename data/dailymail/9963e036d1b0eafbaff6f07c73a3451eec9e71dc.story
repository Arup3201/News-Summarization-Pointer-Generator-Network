As the future of their show lies in doubt, the Duck Dynasty clan are still making millions thanks to their megabucks Walmart merchandising deal, MailOnline can today reveal.

The Robertson family has a merchandise empire that is estimated by Forbes to be worth about $400million - and their deal with Walmart makes up around half of this.

And today, as Walmart refused to comment on the future of their relationship with the TV family, just one glimpse at the chainstore's website shows fans are flocking to buy Duck Dynasty merchandise amid the furor over patriach Phil Robertson's homophobic comments.

Meanwhile, MailOnline can reveal a publicist from A&E DID accompany Phil to his interview with GQ magazine -but was NOT there when he made his incendiary comments.

Walmarts sells a huge array of Duck Dynasty merchandise- from T-shirts to camo bedding, posters, watches, toy trucks, camo chairs, clothing, jewellery and even bottle openers.

Today, as Phil Robertson's close-knit family insisted they would not film the hit A&E show without him following his suspension by the network, fans tweeted they were rushing to Walmart.

However, others pointed out that this support merely puts more money into A&E's pockets as well, with one tweeting: 'Loving that Tea People are rushing to Walmart to Duck Dynasty swag in protest of A& who OWNS the merchandising.'

Another added: 'I better rush off to Walmart and buy up all the Phil Robertson merchandise 'cuz it's gonna be a collectors item one day.'

Another tweet read: 'Your stores may look quite vacant when you pull down the Duck Dynasty merch. May want to double down on the Honey Boo Boo.'

A Walmart spokeswoman declined to comment.

Family support: The Robertson clan have threatened to quit the hit-rated show. In a statement, they said: 'As a family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm'

Walmart announced at their annual shareholders meeting that the best-selling item of apparel for both men and women this year was the reality show's T-shirt, according to Forbes.

Forbes writer Claire O'Connor said: 'When I was down in Arkansas for this Walmart meeting, you really do marvel at the amount of people who are wearing these Duck Dynasty T-shirts and hats.

'There are kids pajamas, there is camo bedding and you probably won't be surprised to hear that they sell Duck Dynasty prayer devotionals.'

This also includes the No. 1 country album on Billboard for the month of November, Duck the Halls.

She added that even though Walmart had dumped Paula Deen over her racism row, it was 'still early' with regards to Duck Dynasty, saying: 'I think for this demographic, anti-gay rhetoric is not considered as much of a huge sin as racism.

'The ball is in Walmart's court. They are going to have to make some sort of decision on this. The only way this retail empire will be at stake is if Walmart decides they are not going to sell these items anymore and I really cannot see that happening. Other smaller brands will probably wait for Walmart to take the lead on this.'

Meanwhile, a source revealed a publicist from Duck Dynasty was there when Phil was interviewed for the January issue of GQ.

Jokes: Walmart's deal with the Robertson clan is said to be worth nearly half their $400million merchandising haul

However, the interview took place in 
several locations and the publicist did not accompany the GQ journalist 
and Phil when they went for a ride on ATVs.

The source said: 'A&E sent
 a publicist for the duration of the interview, but she was not there 
for the 'anus v vagina' comment. But to be honest, Phil was making 
similar comments throughout the interview and it's not like he wouldn't 
have said it in front of her.

'It was just that they were riding ATVs and the publicist was not there for that specific moment.'

This
 means that A&E would have been aware of the sentiment of Phil's 
interview - and could have been pre-warned of the scandal that erupted 
when he called being gay a sin, adding: 'It seems like, to me, a vagina 
-- as a man -- would be more desirable than a man’s anus.

'That’s
 just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to 
offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: 
It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.'

As A&E today remained quiet, it was reported the network still plans to make hay from the show.

TMZ reported that Duck Dynasty is taking over A&E's Christmas schedule. The network will air four separate rerun marathons of the show in four days - from December 22 until 25, totalling 33.5 hours of airtime.

Following Phil's suspension from the program, the Robertson family released a statement reading: 'We want to thank all of you for your prayers and support. The family has spent much time in prayer since learning of A&E's decision.

'We want you to know that first and foremost we are a family rooted in our faith in God and our belief that the Bible is His word. While some of Phil’s unfiltered comments to the reporter were coarse, his beliefs are grounded in the teachings of the Bible. Phil is a Godly man who follows what the Bible says are the greatest commandments: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart” and “Love your neighbor as yourself.”

Prayers: Willie Robertson's daughter Sadie tweeted her thanks

Phil would never incite or encourage 
hate. We are disappointed that Phil has been placed on hiatus for 
expressing his faith, which is his constitutionally protected right.

'We
 have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a 
family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch 
at the helm. We are in discussions with A&E to see what that means 
for the future of Duck Dynasty. Again, thank you for your continued 
support of our family.'

And Phil remains backed by his family, 
with his grandson John Luke - son of Willie - tweeting: 'What has this 
country come to? Unbelievable.' As his sister added: 'Thank you for all 
the prayers. It means a lot to the family.'

Brother: Sadie's brother John Luke said his grandfather's suspension was 'unbelievable'
