A video has been released by the North Korean government showing detained American veteran Merrill Newman, 85, admitting to being 'guilty' of crimes including killing innocent civilians when he was a soldier in the Korean War.

Newman, who has not been heard from since he was detained on October 26, is seen reading a four-page hand-scribbled letter on camera in an undisclosed location in the video released on Saturday.

The veteran from California looks uneasy in the video, and with shaking hands apologizes for what he supposedly did 60 years ago.

‘I realize that I cannot be forgiven for 
my offensives but I beg for pardon on my knees by apologizing for my 
offensives sincerely toward the DPRK government and the Korean people 
and I want not punish me,' he reads.

Chilling video: Merrill Newman, 85, 'admits' to being ‘guilty of a long list of inedible crimes’ against the North Korean government, including the deaths of 50 North Korean soldiers under his command. The video was released on Saturday and was seemingly filmed on November 9. He is seen bowing after he finished reading the letter

In the video, which was seemingly filmed on November 9, Newman 'admits' to being ‘guilty of a long list of inedible 
crimes’ against the North Korean government, including the deaths of 50 North Korean 
soldiers under his command.

‘According to my order they collected 
information of the KPA and attacked the communication system and killed 3
 innocent operators, delayed the munitions supply using explosives 
obtained from attacking the mine and they attacked the KPA and harassing
 operations of the rear base 10 times in the Hwanghae Province Area,’ he
 reads.

‘As I killed so many civilians and KPA 
soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean 
War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government 
and Korean people,’ he said, according to the letter released by Buzzfeed.

It is not known whether Newman was forced to write the letter or whether he did so at his own free will. 

North Korea's official KCNA news agency said Saturday they had arrested Newman for ‘hostile acts’ against the state.

They accused him of having 
'masterminded espionage and subversive activities' against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and that he was 'involved in killings of service personnel of the 
Korean People's Army and innocent civilians'.

'He admitted all his crimes and made an apology for them,' KCNA said.

North Korea is technically still at war with South Korea and the United States. The parties signed a truce, not a peace treaty, to end the Korean conflict.

Sealed: The war veteran was seen signing the letter and stamping it with his thumbprint after he finished reading it to the camera

Formal apology: The North Korean government released this photo of the alleged four-page 'apology' letter that Newman read out loud and then stamped with his thumbprint

Newman says in the chilling video that he came to North Korea on the recent trip with plans to ‘shamelessly’ meet surviving soldiers and their families.

He says he had plans to connect them with the members of the Kuwol 
Partisan Comrades-in-Arms Association to organize an ‘anti-Communist 
strategic plot’.

‘Please forgive me. I will never commit the offensive act against the DPRK Government and the Korean People again,’ he says.

‘On
 this trip I can understand that in US and western countries there is 
misleading information and propaganda about DPRK. If I go back to USA, I
 will tell the true features of the DPRK and the life the Korean people 
are leading,’ he ends the letter saying.

The
 former US Marine is seen bowing to the camera after he finished reading
 the letter and then signing it and stamping the paper with his thumbprint.

'I am guilty': The full transcript of the poorly-written letter, which has many grammatical errors, was published by the KCNA. It is unknown whether Newman wrote it himself

'Looking up old comrades': A document that reads as an email sent by Newman is seen in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on November 30

Newman, of Palo Alto, California, traveled to North Korea with a friend as part of a tour group based out of Beijing, China.

But,
 as he was about to fly back to the U.S. on October 26, a uniformed 
North Korean officer came on the plane, asked to see his passport, and 
then requested he be removed from the flight, his son, Jeffrey Newman, 
said Wednesday.

'My dad got off, walked out with the stewardess, and that's the last he was seen,' the younger Mr Newman said.

Merrill Newman's traveling companion, former Stanford University professor Bob Hamrdla, was allowed to return and later told ABC News that it must have been a 'terrible misunderstanding'.

'I
 hope that the North Koreans will see this as a humanitarian matter and 
allow him to return to his family as soon as possible,' Mr Hamrdla said.

Arrested: Newman was detained by the North Korean government on October 26 when he was on a plane to fly back to the US

The U.S. Department of 
State has declined to publicly confirm Mr Newman's detention, only 
saying that the agency has updated its travel warning for North Korea, 
recommending that Americans refrain from traveling to the Communist 
country.

'U.S. citizens 
crossing into North Korea, even accidentally, have been subject to 
arbitrary arrest and long-term detention, ' the DOS said.

Jeffrey
 Newman said his father was a constant traveler but had always wanted to
 visit North Korea, and took lessons in the language before leaving on 
the nine-day trip.

'This has been a lifelong dream of his,' he said.

Mr
 Newman said he believed the desire for the trip came from the three 
years his father spent as an infantry officer in the Korean war, but he 
said Merrill Newman never talked about his service.

Jeffrey Newman said he'd received 
postcards from his father saying the trip was going well, but on the 
last day of the tour, according to Mr Hamrdla, Merrill Newman met with 
North Korean officials and he came away with some uneasy feelings.

'We think that the conversation was difficult at times,' Mr Newman said, but did not know details.

The
 U.S. has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, but a state 
department official told the San Jose Mercury News that the Swedish 
Embassy in Pyongyang has been acting as a go-between in matters 
concerning Americans who find themselves in trouble in North Korea.

The
 Swedish ambassador also delivered his father's heart medication to the 
North Korean Foreign Affairs Ministry, but it's unclear whether he had 
received it.

Pyongyang's
 secretive, authoritarian government is sensitive about foreign 
travelers, and tourists are closely monitored. The North has previously 
accused Seoul, Washington and other outsiders of working to sabotage its
 system -- statements that analysts see as a way to strengthen domestic 
support for young leader Kim Jong Un.

Merrill
 Newman has lived in a retirement complex with his wife, Lee, since 2011
 in Palo Alto, where he's a big part of the alumni community at nearby 
Stanford University, his son said.

Golden years: Newman retired from finance in 1984 and has been living with his wife, Lee, in this 10-story retirement home in Palo Alto called Channing House

Avid travelers: Newman, left, and his neighbor 
Bob Hamrdla, former Stanford University professor, right, decided to go 
on the North Korean adventure together in mid-October

Jeffrey Newman said he believed North 
Korea would eventually release him after realizing that all they have is
 an 'elderly traveler, a grandfather with a heart condition.'

'We
 don't know what this misunderstanding is all about,' Jeffrey Newman 
said. 'All we want as a family is to have my father, my kids' 
grandfather, returned to California so he can be with his family for 
Thanksgiving.'

Merrill Newman is a retired finance 
executive for technology companies. Following the war, Mr Newman earned a Master's degree in education from 
Stanford University while working as a high school teacher.  

For 50 years, Newman volunteered for the American Red Cross, teaching CPR and first aid, according to

Since
 his retirement in 1984, Newman and his wife have become avid travelers,
 going on sailing adventures and visiting countries throughout South 
America.

According to a 
newsletter put out by their upscale senior complex, Channing House, Mr Newman took Korean 
language classes in preparation for the trip and was reportedly traveling on a 
valid visa.

Jailed: Kenneth Bae, a 45-year-old tour operator and Christian missionary, was arrested last November while leading a group of tourists in the northeastern region of Rason in North Korea and has been detained for the past year

His neighbors 
at the retirement home were bewildered by the news of his detention, one
 of them saying that Mr Newman was simply going on a 'fun' trip and had no 
ulterior motives.

The detention comes about a year after
 North Korea detained another American. North Korea has detained at 
least six other Americans since 2009.

Korean-American
 Kanneth Bae, a 44-year-old Christian missionary, has been incarcerated 
in the country for the past year despite a campaign launched by his 
family pressing for his release.

Bae was accused of planning a religious coup and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor.

Since
 January 2009, four U.S. citizens have been arrested for entering the 
country illegally, and two others who entered on valid visas were 
arrested on other charges.

North
 Korea lately has been relaxing its restrictions on U.S. tourists. 
Several small travel agencies have sprung up in response to the growing 
interest in North Korea among Westerners.

However,
 North Korean News reported that tour operators are often inexperienced 
and lack the necessary knowledge to keep their customers safe.
