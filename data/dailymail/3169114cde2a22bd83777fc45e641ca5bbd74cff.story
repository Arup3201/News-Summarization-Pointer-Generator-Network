It was party time for victorious Slovakia as they flew home to Bratislava after their Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus, much to the frustration of their airline crew and some fans. 

Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel is shown leading the singing during his team's post-match celebrations in a video posted on the Slovak Football Association's Facebook page.

The accuracy of their headline, 'When The National Team Helps Stewardess', is up for debate with their antics including mocking the flight attendant during her demonstration of safety procedures before take off and loud celebratory singing in aisle during food service.

But while some supporters weren't pleased with the behaviour, the vast majority commenting on the Facebook post were right behind their team as they continued their stellar wind-up to France 2016. 

Jan Kozak's side has plenty to cheer after two massive wins in the last international window, first the 2-1 win over Spain and then the convincing 3-1 result in Belarus on Sunday.

A double from Napoli midfielder Marek Hamsik and another from Turkish club Bursaspor's Stanislaw Sestak put Belarus away for a valuable victory to capitalise on their upset over the 2010 World Cup winners.

Marjan Kovacic, a Bratislava-based Liverpool fan, is quoted in the Mirror voicing her disappointment with the national team: 'I understand that they are happy and have a right to celebrate, but they shouldn't be behaving in such a manner on board a flight?'

But 'Super guys' is a more common cry among those commenting on the video. However,  Facebook user Karol Mar-ko Jurík has sympathy for the airline staff saying: 'The flight attendants should get extra pay for difficult working conditions.'

With seven matches still to come in qualifying and plenty of chances for their fortunes to change, Slovak fan Robert Siran is looking ahead: 'Now I'm going to slowly buy tickets for Euro [2016].'
