Michael van Gerwen showed class and tremendous resolve under pressure on Thursday night night as he moved into the semi-finals of the William Hill World Darts Championship.

Exactly a year after he became world champion, the 25-year-old progressed into the final four with a thrilling 5-2 victory over Robert Thornton, the ninth-ranked player.

But it could easily have gone the distance as the Scot, who had trailed 3-0 at one point, missed a dart to level at 3-3.

Van Gerwen, who banks £60,000 for reaching this stage, may have hit a superb 170 finish to secure the win but he acknowledged it had been a hard-fought match.

The Dutchman said: ‘I was playing very well but Robert fought back.

‘I was under pressure. I was a bit nervous. I thought to myself, “This can’t happen, can it?” The 170 finish to win was such a big relief for me.

‘I had a 106 average at the end but I am not happy with my performance. I can do a lot better. I can improve to win this tournament. If you want to be a winner, you can’t be scared of who you play next. That is the most important thing.’

By his own admission, Van Gerwen started sluggishly in the opening rounds at Alexandra Palace. He was far from lethargic here early on.

Back to his rapid-fire best, Van Gerwen recorded a three-dart average of 112.59 in the opening set. These were the first sets that Thornton had dropped this tournament after winning 11 straight in three matches. 

Van Gerwen had raced into a 3-0 lead but was pegged back to 3-2 by Thornton 

Yet the 47-year-old, from Ayrshire, is renowned on the PDC circuit as a battler and those qualities came to the fore in the fourth and fifth sets. A memorable comeback and a massive upset were on the cards.

Thornton had a chance to square it at 3-3 with an 81 finish — his third dart vibrated the wire of the bullseye — but he was then punished by the world No 1, who moved remorselessly through the gears.

Thornton had an average of 101.49 and he was philosophical about defeat. ‘That wasn’t good enough,’ he said. ‘Michael played well, and produced some good finishes. That is the name of the game. I’m not disappointed because I have got this far.’

The man who will be trying to prevent Van Gerwen from reaching a third successive final will be Gary Anderson. The 44-year-old beat fellow countryman Peter Wright 5-1. 

Anderson said: ‘Michael is the world champion. The pressure is on me. He will need to prove he is the better player ... because I will be right behind him.’
