Crawling is an evolutionary phenomenon which might have evolved 200-300 years ago thanks to wooden floors in houses, say experts.

David Tracer, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado, has found that crawling is not what babies do everywhere across the world, and for good reason.

Tracer’s discovery happened by accident, during his time in Papua New Guinea where he had been surveying the Au people since 1988 for studies on child and maternal health and nutrition.

Not worldwide: Crawling is not what babies do everywhere across the world

A Eurueka moment: Anthropologist David Tracer's discovery happened by accident, during his time in Papua New Guinea where he had been surveying the Au people since 1988

He was told by one of his graduate students that the Au babies never seemed to be crawling.

‘That’s when the lightbulbs went off,’ says Tracer to PopularScience.com.

The babies are carried by their mothers or siblings 86 per cent of the time during the infants' first 12 months, and when they are put down, the young children are usually placed in a sitting position, instead of prone on their stomachs.

Au babies go through an upright ‘scooting’ or shuffling phase, in which they push themselves along with their hands while sitting on their backsides.

The reason for this is because of parasites on the ground, which are common in the area the Au live.

In
Africa, and other similar societies, preventing predator attacks is 
similarly a reason why babies do not crawl and are carried throughout 
their first year and then walk straight away after that.

According to Tracer, crawling may have evolved around the same time as wooden floors in houses – only about 200-300 years ago.

‘For most of evolutionary history, kids were not put on the ground to shield them from pathogens or predation, so crawling is definitely the evolutionary novelty,’ says Tracer.

Our closest relative, the apes, rarely put their babies on the ground, but instead teach them to crawl on their mothers’ bellies.

‘It almost seems to be there is some kind of phylogenetic heritage to not crawling,’ Tracer says.

Some countries still do not allow their babies to crawl, such as Papua New Guinea, due to parasites on the ground
