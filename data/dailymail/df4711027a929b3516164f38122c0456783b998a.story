Mal Loye 
could barely grasp what he had just heard when Lancashire team-mate Lou 
Vincent offered him £10,000 one day in 2008 to get out for fewer than 10
 in a Twenty20 game the following afternoon against Durham.

A
 chat with his mum that night helped crystallise his reasons for saying
 no. 'I said: "Mum, I don't think I'd even do it for 100, 200, 300 
grand",' Loye told Sportsmail. 'Ultimately, it's about looking your 
parents in the eye. They'd given all their time for me to play sport as a
 kid. That was the thing - not the money.'

Next
 day, a few hours before the start of the match, Loye was warming up in 
the nets when Vincent upped the offer. 'He said: "Look, the money's 
double - £20,000." I just gave him a definite no. I said: "Louey, I 
don't want any part of it". I had too much respect for the game.'

Speaking out: Mal Loye says players offered bribes must tell bosses

The 
41-year-old Loye, who played seven one-day internationals for England in
 early 2007, quit the game four years later and now coaches at 
Wellingborough School in Northamptonshire, told no-one about Vincent's 
approach other than his mum, his then girlfriend and a couple of mates, 
who advised him to put it out of his mind and get on with his career.

He
 did precisely that, without ever feeling entirely comfortable - until 
he was contacted out of the blue by the ECB's anti-corruption unit last 
year, then interviewed by police.

The
 immediate feeling was relief. And, now that Vincent's testimony to the 
ICC's own anti-corruption officials has been laid bare, Loye feels able 
to talk in detail for the first time about the day, six years ago, that 
threatened to turn his life upside down.

Hitting out: Mal Loye in that 2008 Twenty20 game for Lancashire against Durham

India's Supreme Court has ordered a full investigation into corruption in the Indian Premier League, including the role of Narayanaswami Srinivasan, the suspended president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

It follows an initial probe by a three-member team headed by retired judge Justice Mukul Mudgal that found Chennai Super Kings team principal and Srinivasan's sonin- law Gurunath Meiyappan guilty of being in contact with illegal bookmakers.

The panel has been asked to submit its report by the end of August.

'I was a 
target, a victim,' he said. 'I was in a no-win situation and I still am.
 I don't deserve it. I didn't deserve it. I put my heart and soul into 
cricket, and it wasn't to be associated with this. I take no 
satisfaction out of talking to the police last year but, in a weird way,
 it was a bit of a relief. I tackled a major problem deep within my 
psyche, and it all came out. I broke down just talking about it.'

It
 was not the first time Loye's unwanted brush with cricket's underworld 
had reduced him to tears. Watching the highlights of the 
Lancashire-Durham game that night at home, the stress of the day washed 
over him. 'It was the only time I'd watched the game until the ECB 
officers showed it me again last year.'

Loye's
 memories of the match remain strikingly vivid, despite the fact that, 
by his own admission, he had spent the five years until spring 2013, 
when the ECB contacted him, repressing the experience.

'There 
were two awkward situations that day which will always live with me,' he
 said. 'We batted first and I was getting my pads on, clear in my mind 
that I'd never been so determined in my life to get to 10.Before Lou and
 I walked out to open the batting, I turned, fully padded up, to look at
 my team-mates, who were pumped up and ready to go. It was a big, big 
game for us, and I felt this guilt towards them that I'd never felt 
before. It was the first time it hit me.

'As
 we walked out to open together, I wasn't 100 per cent sure that Lou 
would be up to something, but I knew after the first over. That was the 
other awkward situation.

'We met in the middle after it had been bowled, and Louey just said: "You know what I've got to do."

'To
 get through that day - then the whole thing came flooding back watching
 the highlights that evening on Sky. That was the breakdown. And then I 
moved on.'

Failing to
 report an approach was not the misdemeanour in 2008 that it is now, and
 Loye attempted to rationalise Vincent's behaviour by putting it partly 
down to his struggles with depression.

But he suspects now that Vincent
 targeted him because he was going through problems of his own, of a 
personal nature at home, and with his testimonial  season, at a time 
when the recession meant people were keeping their hands in their 
pockets.

'The
 only time I felt angry with Louey was when it hit me that he probably 
knew how vulnerable I was,' said Loye. 'It was my naivety. I genuinely 
thought he was trying to do me a favour.'

Against
 Durham, in one of three county games now under the ICC's scanner, 
Vincent fulfilled his side of the Faustian pact, steering Shaun Pollock 
towards a second slip to depart for one from five balls.

'It was 
brilliant how he did it,' remembered Loye, who went on to smash 53 from
 37 deliveries, ending for ever the possibility that anyone might one 
day conclude he had been tempted by Vincent's offer.

He said: 'It's one reason why I'd like to speak to Louey now. If I'd nicked off for less than 10, where would that have put me?

'Everyone would have looked at me in a completely different light.'

Why does he think Vincent got involved? 'He probably got himself into a serious hole.

'My gut feeling is that he was quite angry with the game, which was financially not as rewarding as other sports.'

Out of line: Vincent threw his wicket in matches but on this occasion against Lancashire in a T20 quarter-final, defied his paymasters

What advice would Loye now offer a cricketer who received a similar approach?

'I put it out of my head,' he said. 'Yet here we are, six years down the line, and it's out there.

'As
 soon as you get approached, you tell someone - and tell the right  
people. Those right people have to be made clear to the players.

'The
 Professional Cricketers' Association are doing a great job, and the ECB
 were brilliant with me, but I still think the counties could do more.'
