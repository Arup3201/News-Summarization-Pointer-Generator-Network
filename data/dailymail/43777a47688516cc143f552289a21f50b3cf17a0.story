Emergency workers today recovered the crumpled wreckage of a helicopter after it crashed into a river killing all four people on board.

Chinese billionaire Lam Kok, 46, was surveying his newly-purchased vineyard in southwest France with his son Shun Yu Kok, his interpreter and advisor Peng Wang and winemaker James Gregoire when their aircraft crashed into the Dordogne river.

Rescue crews today extracted most of the helicopter with a crane from the Dordogne River after removing the body of 12-year-old Shun Yu Kok from the wreckage.

Investigation: The aircraft will be thoroughly examined to try and discover the cause of the crash

But the search is still continuing for the bodies of the other three men.

Vincent Corbel, of the regional gendarme service, said the reason for the Friday night crash is unclear.

The wreckage of the helicopter will be examined for clues in the hope of shedding light on what happened.

Corbel said the former owner of the Chateau de la Riviere vineyards, Mr Gregoire, owned the helicopter and appeared to have been piloting it.

Lam Kok, who headed Hong Kong-based company Brilliant Group, drew attention in the French media when he bought the chateau, one of a string of Chinese purchases of French vineyards in recent years.

Remains: The Robinson R44 helicopter has been left virtually unrecognisable after the crash

The four had boarded the helicopter, piloted by Mr Gregoire, on Friday to make a celebratory tour of a Bordeaux chateau and wine-growing estate that Lam had just bought from him.

After pausing the search on Saturday night, divers resumed scouring the cold waters of the Dordogne around 9.00am on Sunday.

'We are meticulously combing the area, with practically no visibility, almost by hand,' local gendarmerie commander Ghislain Rety said. Police said strong currents were hampering the search.

Helicopters with infra-red cameras 
were flying over the river and a special sonar designed for finding 
bodies had arrived from the French city of Strasbourg, Mr Rety said.

Some 100 police were searching along the riverbanks and reinforcements were expected.

Officials were expected to carry out an autopsy on Mr Kok's son today, but officials said there was little hope the reasons for the crash would be identified quickly.

'The causes of the accident have not been determined at this stage and most likely will not be for several weeks,' local prosecutor Christopher Auger said.

The investigation into why the helicopter crashed could take weeks or even several months

Mr Kok's wife pulled out of the flight at the last minute saying she was 'scared of helicopters', an AFP photographer at the scene said.

Mr Gregoire had bought the land and its 8th Century chateau in 2003 after Jean Leprince, the previous owner, died when his aircraft also crashed nearby.

All in the helicopter had been taking part in a celebratory press day, marking the sale of the historic estate.

They were planning to take a short tour of the vineyard and the grounds of the Château de la Riviere, and when they did not return after 20 minutes, those who had stayed behind contacted emergency services.

Efforts: More than 100 police are involved in the search after the helicopter crash on Friday

Desperation: A relative of Mr Kok's shouts his name from the riverbank

Hunt: Police sources said that the search was difficult because of very poor visibility

A major search operation was launched using emergency helicopters and around 100 officers on foot.

Inflatable boats were deployed after police received a call from a member of the public indicated the helicopter may have fallen into a nearby river, but no trace of the helicopter has yet been found.

In a bizarre twist of fate, a previous owner of the Château de la Riviere -- one of the region's oldest estates -- was killed in a helicopter crash in 2002.

Mr Gregoire bought the 160-acre property, the largest in Bordeaux's Fronsac appellation, the following year.

seeing plummet into the river

Ill fated: The party had been planning to take a short tour of the vineyard and the grounds of the chateau

Earlier on Friday, the vineyard's managing director Xavier Buffo said during a press conference the sale marked the largest Chinese investment in Bordeaux property to date.

Mr Kok's Brilliant group, which specialises in rare teas and luxury hotels in China, had said it wanted to turn the château into a high class tea and wine tasting centre.

The group, whose interests range from Pu'er - a dark fermented tea from China's Yunnan region - to top-end resorts, also planned to build a hotel near the château.

Chinese consumers have developed a taste for the finest French wines and their extensive buying power has been credited with pushing prices for certain vintages to record levels.

In recent years they have increasingly taken to buying vineyards as well. But the level of each transaction has generally been under 10million euros ($13.6 million).
