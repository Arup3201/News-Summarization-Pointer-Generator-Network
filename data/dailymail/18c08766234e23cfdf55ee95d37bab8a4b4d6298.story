A dog has been praised for digging up a veteran's Purple Heart 25 years after the treasured medal went missing.

Smuckers, a Labrador-golden retriever, found the award buried in the backyard of his owners' Denver house in 2004.

His discovery prompted an 11-year journey to find Korean War veteran Cpl Richmond Litman, who is buried nearby in Colorado's Fort Logan National Cemetery.

Hero: Smuckers, a Labrador-golden retriever, being embraced by Leatra Plick after he dug up her father's Purple Heart while playing in the backyard. Her father, Cpl Richmond Litman, was a Korean War veteran

Treasured: This is tiny heart-shaped medallion which is awarded to U.S. servicemen wounded in battle

Decorated: Cpl Litman, who died in 1990, served in South Korea between 1948 and 1950, when he was hit

Finally, after calling every Litman family they could find, Smuckers' owners Steve Jankousky and Tom Unterwagner saw an advert for a veterans reunion which led them to the serviceman's daughter Leatra Plick.

On Monday, at a ceremony beside Cpl Litman's white marble headstone, Smuckers presented Plick with the small medal on a purple ribbon. 

Plick, whose father died in 1990, told the Denver Post: 'I will honor it as much as he honored it when he was alive. I truly appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.'

According to the paper, Cpl Litman joined the army in 1948, when he was immediately dispatched to South Korea. 

Discovery: Smuckers' owner Steve Jankousky has spent 11 years trying to track down the family

Sniffing around: Jankousky was gardening when Smuckers ran up with the award at home in Denver in 2004

Finally returned: The family got in touch with Purple Hearts Reunited, who helped connect them with Plick

Salute: Members of Purple Hearts Reunited salute Cpl Litman's grave in Denver, Colorado

Two years later he was wounded in battle. He would later receive his Purple Heart for putting himself in the line of danger for his country. 

Litman relocated to Denver, Colorado, where he lived with his family until his death in 1990.

Describing the moment Smuckers discovered the medal, Jankousky told USA Today: 'I was just trying to put the dirt back in the hole, when I saw something shiny and that was it. 

'And I went back inside and told [Unterwagner], "You're not going to believe what she dug up."'

Ret. Col. Jeff Roy, of the Military Order Of The Purple Heart, told the station: 'It is very important to remember the veteran that either gave his life, or shed his blood for his country, and that it remain with the family.' 

Ceremony: Jankousky gave Smuckers a purple ribbon leash for the occasion on Sunday

Special occasion: Dogs are not normally allowed in the cemetery but the directors made an exemption

Delighted: Leatra Plick, pictured with her husband, told Fox she was delighted to finally receive the medal
