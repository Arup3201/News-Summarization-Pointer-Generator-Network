Russia today accused the West of pushing Ukraine into a 'fratricidal war' and repeated Moscow's calls for an end to the interim Ukrainian government's military action against pro-Kremlin separatists.

The remarks from Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, were in line with frequent Russian statements placing blame on the United States and EU for the turmoil in Ukraine, where government forces killed dozens of rebels in the eastern Donetsk province on Monday and Tuesday.

'The people (of Ukraine) are in essence 
being pushed into the abyss of fratricidal [conflict within a single 
organisation] war,' Russian news agencies quoted Lavrov as saying at a 
ministry reception attended by the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, 
Patriarch Kirill.

But he was robustly countered by Ukraine's president-elect who vowed that his tough crackdown would flush out the separatists.

'We will no longer let these terrorists kidnap people and kill them,' Petro Poroshenko told a German newspaper.

'Fratricidal war': The protests come as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of pushing the country into a civil conflict

'We will end this terror. There is a real war being waged against our country.'

Poroshenko
 insisted he was not formally giving orders ahead of his inauguration, 
but that he was in close contact with the government and aims to see 
pro-Russian insurgent leaders captured and put on trial.Â 

'I can tell you that the operation has at last really begun,' he said.

Lavrov did not name any nation but made 
clear he was blaming the West, saying Ukraine's crisis was caused by 
'efforts to use the country not as a unifying link between different 
parts of the Eurasian space, which is its absolutely natural role, but 
as a watershed between the west and east of the European continent'.

Former
 Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich's abrupt decision to shun a 
proffered free trade and economic support package from the European 
Union in November sparked protests that led to his ouster in February.

Russia
 then annexed the Crimea region and pro-Russian separatists seized 
buildings in several eastern cities, leading to a confrontation with the
 interim government and aggravating the worst rift between Moscow and 
the West since the Cold War.

Interfax quoted Lavrov as saying Sunday's presidential election, won by confectionery magnate Poroshenko, 'should help foster an end to the punitive operation' - Russia's term for the government operation in eastern Ukraine.

Lavrov said anyone who accuses Russia of imperialism - after it annexed Crimea, where ethnic Russians are in the majority - is mistaken.

'The concept of a Russian world that is advanced by the Russian state and the Russian Orthodox Church has nothing to do with imperial schemes.

'It is about preserving spiritual and cultural ties between people,' Interfax quoted him as saying.

Meanwhile the Danish government has said armed separatists in the east of Ukraine are holding a team of four OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) observers.

The group was on patrol in Donetsk when contact was lost, according to the Danish government. The other monitors are from Turkey, Switzerland and Estonia.

Separately, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov sought to play down claims that he sent soldiers to help pro-Russian activists.

'Ukrainian sources are putting out statements that some 'Chechen units' from Russia have made incursions into Donetsk,' Kadyrov wrote on Instagram, referring to the eastern Ukrainian city where pro-Russian rebels have declared a 'people's republic'.

There were reported sightings of heavily armed Chechen fighters during attacks by pro-Russian rebels on Donetsk's airport this week.

'I officially declare that this does not correspond to the truth. There are no 'Chechen servicemen' or even 'military columns from Chechnya' in the conflict,' insisted the strongman leader.

Russia's armed forces do not have separate Chechen units, Kadyrov said.

'Chechnya is one of the federal subjects of Russia and according to the Constitution does not have (its own) armed forces.'

But he said that it was possible that some members of the large international Chechen diaspora could be fighting in the conflict.

'If someone sees a Chechen in the conflict zone, that is his personal affair,' Kadyrov wrote.

'There are three million Chechens and around 2/3 of them live outside its borders, including in the West,' Kadyrov wrote.

'We cannot and do not need to know which of them are going where.'

Kremlin-loyalist Kadyrov has acknowledged his role in freeing two journalists from pro-Kremlin Russian website Life News after they were detained by Ukrainian pro-government forces.

'Thanks again to you for help in freeing our journalists,' Putin told Kadyrov on Monday.

Kadyrov called himself 'Putin's footsoldier' in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda daily on Sunday.

CNN on Monday published a video where pro-Russian separatists said they came from Chechnya as volunteers and described themselves as 'Kadyrovists'.

Kadyrov responded on Twitter on Tuesday: 'If there were real 'Kadyrovists' in Donetsk, the Ukrainian security forces would now be a pile of corpses.'
