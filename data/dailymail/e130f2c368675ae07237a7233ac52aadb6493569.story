Captain Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers put on a record undefeated 283 for the fourth wicket as South Africa moved into a commanding position on day one of the first Test against West Indies at Centurion.

De Villiers finished the day 141 not out with Amla on 133 at the other end, and the veteran duo will return on day two with the Proteas on 340 for three.

Three consecutive wicket maidens had the home side rocking in the morning session but the Windies had no answer to the blistering strokeplay that was to follow, with pick of the bowlers Kemar Roach leaving the field injured after tea.

The start was slightly delayed by a wet outfield but when play got under way South Africa, who had been put in, took to the front foot with Alviro Petersen sending the first two balls to the boundary as he and Dean Elgar brought up the 50 in just 60 balls.

That solid start was soon taken apart, however, as the hosts lost three wickets in 15 balls for no run.

Petersen went for 27 as Roach found the edge and the ball flew nicely to Devon Smith at first slip, with Elgar following for 28, chasing one from Sheldon Cottrell which found Marlon Samuels at gully.

Faf du Plessis then fell for an eight-ball duck as Roach, who was enjoying a scintillating spell, found the edge again and Denesh Ramdin gobbled up the catch behind the stumps to leave South Africa 57 for three. 

Amla and De Villiers saw the home side to lunch but the former had a remarkable let-off four balls after the interval as Roach kissed his off stump but the bails stayed in place.

The 50 partnership came up off 77 balls as the experienced duo steadied the ship and began to find the boundary with more regularity.

Anything short or wide was getting the treatment but De Villiers was fortunate when he brought up his half-century and the 100 partnership off the same delivery, a miscued pull that flew over Ramdin's head and to the rope.

De Villiers then clobbered the first six of the day back over the head of Sulieman Benn before Amla reached 50 for the 50th time in his Test career. 

Amla had moved on to turn those 50s into 100s on 22 occasions and found the boundary twice in the same over, the second effort a beautiful cover drive.

South Africa were 225 for three at tea and De Villiers reached his 20th Test hundred off just 138 balls, with the 200 partnership off 294 deliveries coming not long after.

West Indies picked up three quick wickets to leave South Africa reeling on 57 for three

Amla was not to be outdone by his team-mate and notched his 23rd Test century off 161 balls as the Proteas were rampant and there was a scare for West Indies as Roach appeared to be struggling with injury.

Roach did not return and while the pace of scoring slowed for the remainder of the session, Amla and De Villiers guided the Proteas to the close with relative ease.
