Being part of an endangered species, searching for food and hiding from predators are arguably the most important day-to-day tasks.

But this red squirrel seems to think his appearance is also a top priority.

While searching for some breakfast, the vain creature glared at his reflection in the water and admired his fur.

James Shooter 
captured the images of the animal enjoying the meal in
the Cairngorms National Park, Scotland.

The wildlife specialist said: 'It was amazing to be able to 
see one of Britain's most iconic species feeding just metres away from 
me and thanks to the incredible reflection pool at Northshots in the 
Cairngorms, I was able to see two at a time.'

The squirrels come to the hide to drink 
water every day and forge their own reflection in the water, creating a 
perfect opportunity for photographers to capture the double image.

Red squirrels have been native to Britain for almost 10,000 years, but were almost wiped out when greys were introduced from North America in the 19th century.

They managed to survive only in isolated areas of the north of England, the Isle of Wight and Scotland.

But last month it was revealed the endangered species is making a comeback in UK woodlands - while their pox-carrying grey cousins are declining.

Research carried out across 300 woodlands over three months in the north of England showed the reds managed to expand their habitat by 7 per cent compared with spring last year - while greys' territory had shrunk by as much as 18 per cent.
