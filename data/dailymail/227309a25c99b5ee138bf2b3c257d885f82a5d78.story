Plenty of people have been driven to distraction by dog mess  - but not many have gone as far as Brighton man Paul Davidson.

Fed up with finding poo on the one piece of green space outside his  home, the 58-year-old  finally snapped - and hit on an unusual way to shame the dogs and their owners.

Mr Davidson has taken a stand by finding every piece of poo on the green and planting a bright pink flag in each one.

So far Mr Davidson has planted more than 100 flags, each individually numbered, to show the scale of the problem

So far he has put up more than 100 of his 'poo flags', which he bought from auction website eBay, in an attempt to highlight the dog fouling.

He said: 'I started to put out pink flags because I was fed up with people walking their dogs here and leaving their dog's mess behind. 

'It's just disgusting. It's about keeping the place clean. We have one bit of grass in a concrete jungle and they are destroying it all.'

Mr Davidson, who suffers from kidney disease, said the green is often the only place he can enjoy some fresh air while between dialysis treatments but even this small pleasure was being destroyed by dog poo.

Despite his illness, Mr Davidson said he was determined to stand up for what was right by shaming the dogs responsible.

Neighbour Charlie Jones said the flags, which shame dog owners who ignore the bins, were 'hilarious'

He said: 'It doesn't stop me from standing up for things like this - and I've got good support from the community with people saying 'well done' as they go past.'

Mr Davidson, who is now on the committee for the Hampshire Court residents' association, spoke to the dog warden about the problem before he came up with the idea.

He added: 'The amount of support I have had is really good. I never expected it to snowball like this.' 

Neighbour Charlie Jones, 47, said: 'It's the only green space for miles.

'The flags just suddenly appeared - they are hilarious.'

And his scheme has even has support from the local authority.

A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said: 'It is a way of pricking the conscience of dog walkers and getting them to act more responsibly.

'It is very hard to secure prosecutions unless we have witnesses coming forward with a good way of identifying the culprit.'
