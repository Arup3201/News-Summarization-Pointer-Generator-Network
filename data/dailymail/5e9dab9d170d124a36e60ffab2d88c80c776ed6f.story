An Indiana woman who rescued a baby squirrel after his nest was accidentally chainsawed in half is being forced to give him up.

Sara Householder has been looking after Rocky the squirrel since March after a tree surgeon sawed through the nest he was in, killing his mother.

Having fed him from a syringe from just a few days old, Ms Householder may now be forced to hand Rocky over to authorities because they say she hasn't got a licence for the animal.

Happy: Householder says inspectors have visited the house and say the squirrel is fine

Householder fed Rocky from a syringe every two hours when he was first rescued

The irony is that Rocky only came to their attention when Ms Householder tried to get a licence, and was then told she had to apply for one before getting the animal.

The Department of Natural Resources said she has now breached the rules and will have to hand Rocky over to a licensed animal rehabilitator by next week.

A tearful Householder told Wane TV: 'I raised him from an infant. I fed him through a syringe every two hours. I will do whateverÂ  it takes to keep my baby.'

The tragic accident happened while 
Housholder's mother-in-law was having some trees removed. Householder 
says she didn't want to keep the squirrel, but took him in out of 
kindness.

The squirrel is being kept in a cage in Householder's home in Fort Wayne, Indiana

Rocky's favourite snack is Reese's Pieces which householder feeds him through the bars of his cage

She said: 'I couldn't let him lie there and die, he was only a few days old, I'm not going to leave him out in the freezing cold in the middle of March.'

But after a while she became attached to Rocky, bought him his own cage and feeds him his favourite snack of Reese's Pieces.

She says he is now part of the family, even getting on with their other animals.

An Animal Care and Control officer even visited the home to check on Rocky, and said everything was fine.

However
Phil Bloom, a spokesman for the Department for Natural Resources, said 
'If someone feels the need to save that animal, which is usually not 
necessary, the proper and legal way to take care of that is to turn that
animal over to a licenses wild animal rehabilitator within 24 hours.'

Rocky has made himself a part of the family and is allowed to run around the living room, even getting along with the family's other animals

Householder says she will do 'whatever it takes to get my baby back'
