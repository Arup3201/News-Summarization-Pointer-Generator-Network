Manchester United are unlikely to pay the £12million Arsenal are demanding for Thomas Vermaelen after their initial bid was rejected.

The Belgium international has just one year to run on his deal at the Emirates and United believe the valuation of the centre-back is too high. Their opening offer was thought to be in the region of £6m.

Napoli also have an interest in Vermaelen but the player himself is keen on a move to Old Trafford.

Sportsmail revealed last week how the 28-year-old had told close pals he wants to leave the Gunners in the direction of United following the World Cup.

Red Devils boss Louis van Gaal wants to sign the defender but the inflated fee could prove a stumbling block.

Vermaelen was forced off during Belgium's 1-0 win over Russia on Sunday but the extent of his knee injury is not yet known.

Arsenal, meanwhile, have already began weighing up various replacements should Vermaelen leave.
