Grammy-winning singer Erykah Badu took to the streets of New York - and only earned $3.60 from busking for less than an hour. 

A video directed by Badu herself, called 'Street Hustle Experiment,' reportedly shows her singing for money last Friday evening on West 42nd Street in Manhattan.

'Peace and light, New York,' she says at the start of the video. 'This is Erykah Badu, and I'm in your city. I'm in your city.'

Busking: Singer Erykah Badu busked for money in New York City, placing her hat on the ground for money

Anonymous: Badu received $3.60 in donations during her busking 'Street Hustle Experiment' 

'I just kind of always wanted to see what it would be like to you know, sing for money on the streets,' she explains. 'So what I'm going to do is I'm going to is find a good place and I want to find a good place. I'm trying to find a good place to stop and do it.'

When someone asks her 'May I take a picture of you?' before the busking starts, Badu yells 'Beat it, I'm trying to do something.'

'I know but I want to take a picture,' the person is heard saying.

Badu later says 'Okay' then smiles for the picture taker, who says 'Thank you, Ms. Badu, you're beautiful.'

Badu then says the  person is beautiful too before getting back to the experiment.

Badu then decides to take off her hat to make it difficult to recognize her - and sets it down for people to make donations while she sings a cappella.

Wearing multiple gold chains and elaborate rings on her fingers, Badu sings 'Please sir, give me some money. Sister, I need some money. Can you give me some money?'

Determined: Badu later held out her hat as she walked around and sang about needing money 

'Haven't sold a record in about two years, yeah, haven't sold a record in a long time, b**** needs some money,' she continues.

Later in the video, dozens of people are seen walking past Badu singing on the street as she raises out her hands.

'I don't want to get no real job, I just want to be out here selling my songs, yeah,' Badu sings at one point.

Badu eventually walks around holding out her hat, as she sings and asks for donations.

'I don't want to get no job, lady I just want your money, yeah girl,' she sings in the clip. 

'Ah! Got some money!' Badu yells as the first woman puts a coin in her hat about four minutes into her efforts at busking.

She is later seen through crows of people, singing and asking for donations.

After '41 1/2 minutes' allegedly pass, Badu counts her earnings and finds a grand total of $3.60.

'See, if you got some initiative, you can make money,' Badu says.

Walking along, she says she is now able to buy possibly a juice or a sorbet.
