James Milner believes Manchester City have enough quality to win the Champions League.

The Barclays Premier League champions have been handed a tough European group with Bayern Munich, Roma and CSKA Moscow standing in their way of progress to the knock-out phase.

City begin their campaign at Bayern Munich on Wednesday and Milner, who scored the winning goal in last season’s 3-2 group stage win at the Allianz Arena, believes Manuel Pellegrini’s team have the experience to lift Europe’s biggest trophy.

Milner said: ‘Yes, I think that a club like we are, and the players we have, that is the ultimate aim. When I first signed at the club, the Champions League was new to the club. 

'It was new to us a team . . . I think having won the Premier League a couple of times, and been fortunate enough to win every trophy domestically, we now want to prove ourselves on the European stage.

‘I believe we have a good enough team to do that.’

Pellegrini will be banned from the touchline on Wednesday night as he serves the second half of a two-game ban for criticising referee Jonas Eriksson following City’s home defeat to Barcelona in last season’s last-16 encounter.
