It's a name that won’t register with many Manchester City supporters, but Sevilla’s Spanish midfielder Denis Suarez, no relation to you know who, played two League Cup games for the Premier League champions before moving to Barcelona last year. 

There he played for the Catalans’ B-team before going on loan to Sevilla this season. 

Judging by Suarez’s battling performance against the superstars of Real Madrid in Cardiff on Tuesday night, he might be back one day playing under Luis Enrique at the Nou Camp.

 Fergie's misses Van Gaal debut 

You might have expected Sir Alex Ferguson to be casting his eyes over successor Louis van Gaal on the Dutchman’s first appearance at Old Trafford on Tuesday night, but instead the managerial legend (right) only had eyes for former United idol Cristiano Ronaldo as he weaved his magic for Real Madrid. Perhaps the Scot was aware that it was 11 years to the day that he signed the young Portuguese from Sporting Lisbon and wanted to mark the anniversary.

 Emery's not so dapper

Sevilla coach Unai Emery again exhibited his penchant for snappy outfits. The Spaniard donned a cheeky dark jacket, with little red elbow pads on the outside, on the touchline. Not sure, even with his physique and sartorial taste, that he quite pulled it off. Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti, meanwhile, looked like he’s enjoyed a good summer . . .

 Elsewhere...

Paul Clement increasingly looks like the next cab off the rank when it comes to the next managerial appointment in the Barclays Premier League. Ancelotti’s loyal assistant has worked with some big names now at Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. He’s also worked with the Republic of Ireland Under 21s and Blackburn. Surely the time is right for the Real Madrid coach to get a crack at being the main man somewhere.
