The outlook for the economy is worsening, international experts said yesterday.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development expects output to shrink by 0.7 per cent this year – far worse than the 0.5 per cent growth it had predicted in May.

Coalition ministers warned however that there was no ‘quick fix’ for the economy while ridiculing Labour’s solution to add more debt.

Hard times: The UK is unlikely to pull out of its double-dip recession this quarter, global economic think tank the OECD has warned, meaning more suffering for British businesses and consumers

The Paris-based OECD also cut its forecasts for other major developed countries including Germany, France and Italy.

But the UK downgrade was by far the 
worst and came as a blow to Chancellor George Osborne’s battle to drag 
the economy out of recession and wipe out the  deficit inherited from 
Labour.

David Cameron said yesterday that it 
was difficult to kickstart growth: ‘If there was a button you could push
 in Whitehall which just said “right, growth comes” I would have pushed 
it long ago.

What the Government can do is set the
 conditions for growth, provide that background of low interest rates, 
low tax rates – which we’ve done in this country – a steady and sensible
 government, then we’ll find that households will want to come forward 
and business will want to come forward and invest.’

In the Commons, Liberal Democrat 
Business Secretary Vince Cable exploded with uncharacteristic anger as 
Labour challenged the Government’s economic record.

He said Britain’s problems stemmed 
from a Labour boom that was allowed to go ‘out of control’, with ‘broken
 banks, a very serious consumer debt problem and very major problems in 
our export market’.

In a speech in Scotland last night, 
Mr Osborne admitted the economic outlook remained uncertain but insisted
 there were some positive signs.

He said: ‘Our economy is healing – 
jobs are being created, manufacturing and exports have grown as a share 
of our economy, our trade with the emerging world is soaring, inflation 
is down, much of the necessary deleveraging in our banking system has 
been achieved, and the world is once again investing in Britain.

‘But the scale of the challenge is so great there are no quick fixes or easy routes to recovery.

‘Nobody is offering a credible or 
convincing alternative economic strategy. There is no easy path to 
recovery and prosperity. We in Britain have to confront our problems 
head on, be honest about the scale of the challenge, and be consistent 
in our determination to succeed.’

Britain is in the worst double-dip recession for more than 50 years and the longest period of economic weakness for a century.

The slump which started in 2008 
outstrips even the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Possible booster: The OECD's predictions do not take into account the effect of the London Olympics, which may help to boost the economy. However initial signs have been that it has not had the expected impact

However, analysts said
 the OECD outlook for the UK was ‘overly pessimistic’ because it did not
 take account of any bounce back from the disruption caused by the 
Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

The International Monetary Fund has 
cut its 2012 forecast to 0.2 per cent growth while the Bank of England 
is expecting stagnation.

The OECD has been one of Mr Osborne’s most influential supporters and has defended the Chancellor’s austerity plans.

Pier Carlo Padoan, of the OECD, said 
the slump was down to global factors, such as the eurozone, and added 
that the Chancellor’s plan to tackle the deficit was ‘appropriate’.

Rachel Reeves, a Labour Treasury 
spokesman, said: ‘These very concerning forecasts show just how badly 
the Government’s economic policies have failed.

‘David Cameron and George Osborne need to stop clinging on to their failed economic plan and change course now.

‘Without a serious plan for jobs and growth we won’t get the deficit down.’
