A bid by Edward Snowden for Icelandic citizenship failed as the country's parliament have voted not to debate it before the summer recess.

The vote leaves Snowden - believed to be staying in a transit area at a Moscow airport - with one option fewer as he seeks a country to shelter him from U.S. espionage charges.

Six members of parliament tabled a proposal to grant Snowden citizenship after they received a request from him via WikiLeaks, opposition parliamentarian Birgitta Jonsdottir said.

But a majority of parliamentarians voted late on Thursday against allowing the proposal to be put on the agenda, a day before parliament went into summer recess. It does not reconvene until September.

'Snowden has formally requested citizenship. But nothing is now going to happen. We could not even vote on it,' Jonsdottir told Reuters.

In a letter dated July 4, posted on Jonsdottir's blog, Snowden wrote that he had been left 'de facto-stateless' by his government, which revoked his passport after he fled the country and leaked information about U.S. surveillance operations.

He has sought asylum in a number of countries, but most, including Iceland, say he must be on their soil for his application to be accepted.

His request for citizenship was a different tack, hoping that Iceland would give him a passport, as it has done in at least one similar case in the past.

'I appreciate that Iceland, a small but significant country in the world community, shows such courage and commitment to its higher laws and ideals' he wrote in the letter.

Under Icelandic law, parliament can grant citizenship to foreigners, which can otherwise usually only be gained through naturalisation after a period of residence.

Chess master Bobby Fischer was granted Icelandic citizenship by parliament after he got into trouble with the United States over tax evasion and breaking sanctions by playing a match in Yugoslavia in 1992.

After years living abroad, he was detained in Japan, where he applied for and was awarded Icelandic citizenship in 2005. He spent his last years in Iceland before dying in 2008.

Iceland's recently elected centre-right government is seen as far less willing to engage in an international dispute with the United States than the previous government, even if it will want to maintain the country's reputation for promoting Internet freedom.

'It is a disappointment that he is facing limited options,' WikiLeaks Icelandic spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told Reuters. 'I am not optimistic that the new conservative government will take steps of courage and boldness to assist Mr Snowden.'

Russian president Vladimir Putin also offered Snowden Amnesty, on the condition that he would stop leaking confidential information about the United States.

He said: 'If he [Snowden] wants to remain here
there is one condition - he should stop his work aimed at inflicting 
damage on our American partners no matter how strange this may sound 
coming from me.'

Snowden has so far applied for asylum
in 21 countries but faces a thinning list of options after Finland, 
India, Ecuador and Poland rejected his plea and a number of others said 
applications can only be made in person on their home soil.

Government investigators began an 
urgent search for Edward Snowden several days before the first media 
reports were published on the government's secret surveillance program.

Snowden,
who has admitted to providing details of the top-secret programs, had 
worked on assignment at a Hawaii facility run by the National Security 
Agency for about four weeks before he said he was ill and requested 
leave without pay, according to the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity.

When Snowden 
failed to return, that prompted a hunt for the contractor, first by his 
employer Booz Allen Hamilton and then by the U.S. government, they said.

Snowden,
29, was known among colleagues as a very gifted 'geek,' according to 
one of the sources, who added, 'This guy's really good with his fingers 
on the keyboard. He's really good.'
