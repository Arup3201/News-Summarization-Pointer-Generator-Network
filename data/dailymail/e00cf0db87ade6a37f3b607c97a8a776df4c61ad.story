Alan Pardew praised the professional attitude of his Crystal Palace players compared to his former Newcastle charges after making a winning start on his return to Selhurst Park.

The Eagles came from behind to defeat Tottenham 2-1 in front of home fans after the new manager challenged his team to be more adventurous.

'I only have one criticism, which is a strange one for the manager to make - they are too honest, too straight. You can't win Premier League games if you are too disciplined,' he said.

Alan Pardew celebrated his return to Selhurst Park with victory over Tottenham

Crystal Palace moved out of the Premier League relegation zone after coming back to win 2-1

'You have to take chances, take risks. You have to have a few maverick players, the player I brought on in the second half (Wilfried Zaha)... that's what the team needs.

'There's a fantastic set of professionals here, I haven't had one fine this week and I'm finding that very unusual as a Newcastle manager - because we used to fine players every 42minutes!

'I'm not being disrespectful to Newcastle players, it's just different set up. I just want to free this team up a little bit and if we do that we could play like we did in the last 20 minutes. 

Pardew described falling behind to Tottenham as 'the best thing that happened' as his  side moved out of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone..

Pardew revealed he had to fine one of his former Newcastle players every 42minutes

In what was Pardew's first home match since taking the reins, Spurs looked set to spoil his return to Selhurst Park when they took the lead early in the second half through Harry Kane.

But a penalty from Dwight Gayle and Jason Puncheon's low strike turned things around, with the Eagles ending a winless run in the league stretching back to November 23.

Pardew told Sky Sports: 'It feels really great for everybody.

'This team has got the shackles on and the exuberance they had at the back end of last year, I knew it wasn't something we were going to get out of them unless we got a goal.

'We started poorly but that wasn't the approach. That's sometimes how the mindset is. So at half-time I managed to get into them and it kind of kicked in a little bit, ironically when Spurs scored. It might sound a bit strange but it was probably the best thing that happened to us.'

Meanwhile, Tottenham manager insisted the decision to award Palace a penalty after Benjamin Stambouli brought down Joe Ledley in the box changed the game with his side were unable to respond.

'The decision contributed because we controlled the game for 65minutes and then the penalty changed the game, ' he said.

'Sure we made a mistake afterwards but the penalty decision was key.

'I don't know if Stambouli got the ball but it is difficult to give an opinion because my players say he didn't touch the player.

'It was difficult after we conceded the goal, they showed more energy than us in the last 15 minutes,' he added.
