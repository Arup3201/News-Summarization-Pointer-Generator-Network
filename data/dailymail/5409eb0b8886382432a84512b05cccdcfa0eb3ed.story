A lovers' tiff between a young couple in China was only resolved after they failed to kill themselves three times.

Ke Mei, 25, and her boyfriend Liu Meng, 26, first tried to slash their wrists, then they tried to blow themselves up, and finally they leapt from the balcony of their flat.

The couple had decided to end it all after rowing furiously because Liu went out with friends the night before and had not come home until late.

That escalated quickly... Ke Mei clutches her boyfriend Lui Meng's neck after they decide to live

They were initially going to split up, but made a suicide pact after deciding that although they couldn't live together, nor could they live without each other.

According to police spokesman Li De, the couple had first smashed a bottle and used a piece of glass to cut their wrists so they could bleed to death together.

But the glass did not slice deep enough and, when they found themselves still breathing 20 minutes later, they switched on their oven and let gas fill the flat before striking a match.

The mixture was too thin to start an explosion, foiling their suicide a second time.

'They then decided to jump to their deaths and climbed onto the other side of the balcony in their flat,' said Mr Li.

'They were both holding each other and went to jump. But at the last minute he changed his mind and grabbed onto the railings, and as she had her hands around his neck she also ended up hanging from him.

'Both of them were screaming for help.'

Firefighters finally show up and lift Ke to safety. After their rescue they fell into each other's arms and declared their love for each other. But now they faces charges over their attempt to kill themselves with a gas explosion

Their calls alerted neighbours, who called the fire brigade. Firefighters broke into the flat and grabbed Mei, who was clinging on to her lover's neck with the last of her strength.

'They then grabbed the man and helped him back to the right side,' said Mr Li. 'After which the couple fell into each other's arms and declared their love for each other.'

They now face charges over the attempt to blow up the flat. Police in the city of Zhuhai, Guangdong province, south-east China, said a report had been handed to prosecutors.
