Hillary Clinton has said that she will make a decision about her presidential run next year, explaining that she hadn’t made up her mind yet.

‘It's such a difficult decision and it's one that I am not going to rush into,’ she said during an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters, who selected the former Secretary of State as her most fascinating person of the year.

‘I haven't made up my mind- really have not. I'll look carefully at what I think I can do and make that decision sometime next year.'

The smirk that hides it all: Hillary Clinton said that she needs to seriously think about running because it is a big decision, but one that she will not make until next year

Clinton is roundly considered the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in 2016 and while she has repeatedly tried to temper expectations and dodge the question at every speaking engagement she has hosted since leaving public office in January, that has done little to quiet her supporters.

One such supporter is her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who she said may have to have a new title if she ever does end up in the White House again.

‘I have no idea- First Mate? I don't know,’ she said of what her husband would be called if she becomes President. 

‘He is very respectful... He wants me to do what I think is right.’

Rounding back: This was not the first year that Barbara Walters picked Mrs Clinton as her 'most fascinating' person of the year as she was also selected back in 1993 when she was the First Lady

While she clearly tried to avoid 
making any commitments, the one thing she seemed certain of was the fact
 that there should be a female president, even though she doesn’t ‘know 
the exact timing of it or who that might be’.

‘It
 matters because we have half the population that has given so much to 
building this country, to making it work and, of course, I want to see 
women in the White House,’ she said.

‘If I look at my friends and former colleagues, who are now in the Senate, it was the women senators, on both sides of the aisle, who finally broke the fever over the government shutdown and the debt limit debate. They have been working across party lines, and we need more of that.’

Clinton may be clearly avoiding and commitment to the 2016 race, but the voters aren’t as a Quinnipaic poll that came out on Tuesday revealed that the majority of voters in the pivotal primary state of Iowa think she would make a good chief executive.

Remaining positive: Clinton said that she doesn't know who it should be or when it should happen but a woman should become president of the United States

Walters asked what time over the past few decades when she has interviewed Clinton did she think was the roughest period for her- with a not-so subtle allusion to her husband’s affair and ensuing impeachment- but Clinton avoided any mention of those scandalous months.

‘The worst times really for me are the personal times- you know, losing my father, losing my mother. Those are the hard times for me,’ she said.

‘When you're in the political public arena, you know you're going to get credit you probably don't deserve and blame you probably don't deserve and you have to chart your own course. You have to stand up for what you think are the right decisions.’
