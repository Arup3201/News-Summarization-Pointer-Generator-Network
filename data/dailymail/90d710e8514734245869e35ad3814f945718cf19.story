Soaring numbers of city dwellers are suffering from hay fever, with urban areas accounting for every one of the UK's hay fever 'hotspots'.

Pharmacists are reporting a sharp rise in the number of people living in towns and cities requesting treatment for the condition.

After a delayed start to the hay fever season due to the very cold April, following the sunny weather over the Mayday Bank Holiday weekend, demand for nose sprays, antihistamines and eye drops has increased by more than 50 per cent this month.

Experts at Chemist Direct analysed thousands of sales of hay fever products across the UK so far this month, and found that for the first time, London came out on top, followed by Birmingham and Manchester. In previous years, demand has been scattered across the UK in both rural and urban areas.

1. London

2. Birmingham

3. Manchester

4. Cambridge

5. Leicester

6. Leeds

7. Reading

8. Liverpool

9. Edinburgh

10. Brighton

'This year we’ve been seeing a lot more people living in towns and cities asking us for advice,' said Omar El-Gohary, Superintendent Pharmacist for Chemist Direct.

'There is some evidence to suggest that pollution, such as cigarette smoke or car exhaust fumes,can make the symptoms of hay fever worse, which could explain why more city dwellers are now suffering from hay fever.'

One of the most common causes of hay fever in early May is oak or plane tree pollen - a particular problem in London and big cities where large plane trees line the streets and squares.

However, the delayed Spring has meant pollen is also being released from other trees – such as the willow – which normally reaches a peak in March and April.

Experts at the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit said last month that because everything has been held back so long, delayed tree pollen could be in the air at the same time as grass pollen.

This creates a perfect storm for sufferers triggering sneezing, itchy, red and watery eyes, and a runny nose.

Research by the Surrey Allergy Clinic in London has also shown that in urban areas, pollens attach to the diesel exhaust particles from cars, which are adept at carrying pollen deeper into the airways or attaching to nasal membranes.

And with the mixed weather continuing, pharmacists are also having to explain the difference between hay fever and colds

'The cold spring has delayed pollen release meaning pollen levels will be at their peak in late spring and early summer which is earlier than normal,' added El-Gohary. 

With the increase in patients experiencing hay fever symptoms, pharmacists are also having to explain the difference between hay fever and colds.

Mr El-Gohary explains: 'A cold is usually distinguished by a runny nose accompanied by a sore throat, cough or mild headache with an initially clear discharge which becomes thick and cloudy, whereas with hay fever, sufferers may have itchy and watery eyes, a sudden onset of sneezing and a runny nose with clear discharge.'

Pharmacists at Chemist Direct advise sufferers to take an antihistamine once symptoms start, shower and change clothes at the end of the day, and to wear wraparound sunglasses to help prevent pollen getting into eyes.

THE COMMON COLD

Caused by a minor viral infection, the symptoms are your body dealing with an attack to its immune system.

Symptoms include:
• Runny nose accompanied with a sore throat, cough, tiredness or mild headache.

• Discharge from nose will tend to start off clear and 
watery but will soon turn thick and quite colourful 
(green/yellow/brown).

• Symptoms may last between 3 days to a week but many people
feel some nasal congestion for up to 3 weeks after the onset of 
symptoms.

HAY FEVER

Caused by pollen from grass and trees, or pollution. Your body is 
reacting to something in the environment that is not actually a threat.

Symptoms include:
• Itchy and watery eyes.

• Runny nose. Discharge from your nose will tend to be watery and clear.

• It’s unlikely that you will also have a sore throat, headache or fever.

• If your symptoms of a runny nose last longer than 3 weeks 
there is a chance you may have hayfever rather than a cold.

Wet weather also means some people are confusing symptoms of the common cold with hay fever, say pharmacists
