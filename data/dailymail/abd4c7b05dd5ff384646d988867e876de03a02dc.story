Hundreds of thousands of savers, frustrated with banking scandals and rock-bottom interest rates, have switched their current accounts in the last year, figures show.

More than 1.2million current account holders have moved to a new provider in the first year of an initiative aimed at taking the hassle out of swapping banks.

Since the scheme was launched in September 2013, there has been a 22 per cent increase in customers switching, according to the Payments Council, which is overseeing the service.

Halifax, Santander (above) and Nationwide Building Society made some of the strongest customer gains

Halifax, Santander and Nationwide Building Society made some of the strongest customer gains, while those suffering net losses in customers include NatWest, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, RBS and the Co-operative.

Experts said banks such as Santander and Halifax had successfully lured savers who were fed up with poor interest rates by offering higher-rate current accounts.

These so-called ‘pseudo-savings’ accounts are attracting thousands of customers at a time when the UK is enduring the worst interest rates on record.

Challenger banks such as Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Metro, which were not included in the data, are also believed to have made significant gains in response to a general distrust in the larger banks.

The industry has been hit with a series of high-profile scandals in recent years which has seen trust in larger lenders plummet.

These have included the widespread mis-selling of payment protection insurance, the rigging of the Libor interest rate, and sky-high bankers’ bonuses.

The data covering which banks people are moving to is released voluntarily and with a six-month delay, and does not include all brands.

Of the banks which agreed to release the data, Halifax made the strongest net gain in current account customers between January and March this year, recording a 41,558 upswing.

It was followed by Santander, which had a net 37,316 rise, while NatWest had the largest net loss, shedding 18,258 customers, followed by Barclays with 16,467.

Experts said Santander and Halifax had successfully lured savers from banks like HSBC (above) by offering higher-rate current accounts.

Co-operative Bank recorded a net decrease of 7,852 customers between January and March. It was embroiled in a scandal in which its former chairman, ex-Methodist minister Paul Flowers, was accused of drug abuse.

Campaigners said the switching figures were still ‘low’ and that changes to make the process quicker were not enough.

Richard Lloyd, of Which?, said: ‘It is clear from today’s low switching figures that the big banks’ stranglehold on the market continues and that quicker switching alone will not solve the lack of competition or trust in banking.’

Sylvia Walcot of website Moneyfacts said that many who switched sometimes did so because of factors such as convenient car parking near their branch, rather than sound financial reasons.

‘It is great that people can switch easily but the interest displayed so far in doing so may be more to do with reasons far removed from the products themselves,’ she added.

Under the switching service, the length of time it takes to swap banks has been cut from up to 30 working days to seven.

Outgoing and incoming payments are also automatically swapped over and if anything goes wrong the consumer is guaranteed not to be left out of pocket.

If you're fed up with your bank there are plenty of reasons why now is a good time to switch to another provider.
