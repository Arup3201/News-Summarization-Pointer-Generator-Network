London Heathrow does a better job of welcoming tourists than New York's JFK airport - and that's according to the Big Apple's very own tourism boss. 

We may complain about delays at our airports and overly chatty taxi drivers, but Fred Dixon, head of New York's tourism authority, NYC & Company, says Heathrow is ahead of the game when it comes to tourists and London cabbies are 'charming'.

'London is in the best shape I think 
it’s ever been in. It’s clean, it’s safe, and very welcoming,' he said, adding that New York still 'has the edge'.

Clean, safe and welcoming: London is a great city for tourists

Warm welcome: London was praised for the visitor experience it provides to tourists

The Big Apple and the Big Smoke are both incredibly popular with tourists, but while New York wins when it comes to
 shopping - with locals spending £5,867 ($9.752) per year, compared to Londoners 
spending £5,345 ($8,881) - the UK capital comes out on top for culture.

London
 boasts 173 museums and 857 art galleries, compared to New York's 131 
museums and 721 art galleries, according to research, recently compiled by 
Fairmont Hotels.

Mr Dixon said Heathrow Airport beats its New York rivals, providing a great customer experience.

He told the Evening Standard: 'I’ve never waited in line more than 30 minutes at Heathrow, even with the volume they do. The sense of arrival is something that we as Americans can learn from and strive for.'

Delays: Mr Dixon says immigration at JFK airport is detrimental

On average New York cabs are cheaper, but Mr Dixon praised London's 'charming' taxi drivers

Meanwhile, Mr Dixon said that delays at 
JFK airport were detrimental to the image of New York city, calling 
immigration a 'headache'.

His comments come after the New York Times sparked a war of words between the two cities, with an article claiming London's buses are dirty, its residents passive-aggressive and its most expensive districts handed over to Russian Oligarchs.

Writer Ben Judah commented: 'The Shard encapsulates the new hierarchy of the city. On the top floors, “ultra high net worth individuals” entertain escorts in luxury apartments. By day, on floors below, investment bankers trade incomprehensible derivatives.'

But Londoners hit back over several inaccuracies in the article, claiming the city was cleaner than suggested, while the owners of the Shard corrected that the top floors are actually office space.

Mr Dixon complimented food, arts and culture in the capital - and praised the London 2012 OIympics for their role in boosting the city's profile. He even called the city's cabbies 'charming'.
