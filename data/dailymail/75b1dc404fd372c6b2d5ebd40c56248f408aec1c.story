Even before it was over, she fell to her knees and let her tears spill on the floor.

Then Gemma Gibbons looked to the heavens and mouthed: ‘I love you Mum’.

This was the moment Britain’s 25-year-old judo sensation had dreamed of since she was a little girl. Now she was about to collect a silver medal and get a chance to go for gold.’

Britain's Gemma Gibbons looks to the heavens after her semi-final win. She whispered 'I love you mum' in tribute to her mother Jeanette, who died of leukaemia in 2004

But in an arena packed with cheering, 
ecstatic fans, one face was missing. Jeanette Gibbons – who introduced 
Gemma to the sport and nurtured her on the path to Olympic standard – 
lost her battle with leukaemia when her daughter was just 17.

So yesterday, in possibly the most 
poignant moment of the Games, millions of viewers around the world 
witnessed the moment Mrs Gibbons could not.

And ‘Our little Gem’ as she once 
called her, won the hearts of a nation. Afterwards she spoke of her joy 
at getting so close to gold – and her frustration at not being able to 
share it with her mother.  

‘I want to say thank you,’ she told us, ‘and obviously I can’t.’

Last night her delighted grandmother Beryl Gibbons told how proud Gemma’s late mother would be if she were still alive.

Jeanette’s 81-year-old mother was too 
nervous towatch the final on TV at home in Sidcup, Kent. (Elsewhere, 
Jeanette’s twin brother, Maurice, hid in the garage).

Her 81-year-old husband, also called 
Maurice, watched the TV with two men who were repairing the roof and 
announced it was over.  ‘Jeanette would be so proud,’ Mrs Gibbons said. 
‘I just know she will be looking down from above. I know her death made 
Gemma even more determined to succeed.’

Gemma brought home Britain’s first 
Olympic judo medal in 12 years by taking silver after a stunning victory
over French world champion Audrey Tcheumeo.

That put her in the final, and 
prompted her message to Mum. Seen on TV, it was instantly underlined by 
presenter Gabby Logan, who described witnessing the moment as ‘my first 
weep of the day’.

But in front of a rapturous crowd, 
Gemma could not defeat American Kayla Harrison in a valiantly fought 
bout at the ExCeL centre.

Foreign Secretary William Hague, a 
judo blue belt, is understood to have briefed David Cameron about her 
when he and the Prime Minister attended with Vladimir Putin, a 
celebrated black belt.

She was hugged by her boyfriend and GB
team-mate Euan Burton in the stands, and applauded by Mr Cameron and 
fellow VIPs. The Prime Minister told her: ‘Well done. Fantastic,’ as she
fought back tears of joy.

Despite the poignancy, what unfolded 
in the wake of her success was an inspiring story of a little girl with a
dream, and a single mother who loyally supported it.

Gemma started judo as a six-year-old 
when Jeanette took her to the Metro Judo Club in Blackheath, South-East 
London. Jeanette raised Gemma  in a small council flat in Charlton after
Gemma’s father left before she was born.  

Her mother then took on all the 
responsibilities of a single parent – working as a nursery nurse to help
fund her talented girl’s ambition to become a champion.

Within ten 
years she was winning gold at the British National Junior Age 
Championships.

But tragedy struck in the spring of 2004 when Jeanette 
died at the age of 49, just six months after being diagnosed.

One dedicated British judo fan who has
followed Gemma’s rise in the sport, recalled: ‘Parents of other kids 
used to say that when they video recorded their kids taking  part in 
competitions all they could hear in the background was the voice of 
Gemma’s mum shouting, “Come on Gem”.’

As her career progressed Gemma won a 
place on the British Judo Association Sport England World Class 
Performance programme. This saw her leave home and move to the West 
Country, where she joined a full time training course at Bath 
University.

Yesterday she finally fulfilled her 
ambition of competing at the Olympics – in a venue just 20 minutes’ 
drive from the flat she once shared with her late mother. She said: ‘We 
didn’t have a lot of money and any money that my Mum did have she put 
into me and my judo career.

‘Obviously I don’t get to say thank 
you for that, so that was a kind of thanks to her. I felt I would have 
definitely made her proud today. She was everything to me.
