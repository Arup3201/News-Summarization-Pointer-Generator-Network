Hatem Ben Arfa will be left to rot in the reserves as he faces a stiff club fine for speaking out over his Newcastle exile.

After insisting he will fight tooth and nail to save his job, under pressure manager Alan Pardew is set to step up his cold war with the out of favour Frenchman, by hitting him in the pocket for giving an unauthorised interview to lift the lid on his Toon limbo.

The club strictly monitors its players’ dealings with the media, and as well as a substantial fine, Ben Arfa is again set to be left out of the match-day squad when Newcastle host relegation-threatened Cardiff.

Cold war: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will fine the Frenchman for his unauthorised interview

Pardew wouldn’t give a direct reaction to Ben Arfa’s revelations that he was ‘sad and frustrated’ at being frozen out by the manager, who he confirmed he exchanged angry words with after the 4-0 defeat to Manchester United last month.

The Newcastle manager said: 'Hatem has made those comments, but my comments are that I pick the team on merit. I’ve not picked the team for Cardiff yet. Hatem’s in our squad in terms of our rota of players, but I’ve not picked the teams or the subs at this stage.  

'The only thing I’d say to the fans is that I hope the team comes first. It’s not about me or Hatem, it’s about the club which is much bigger than any of us as individuals. 

Exchange: Pardew and Ben Arfa had angry words after the defeat to Manchester United

'In the current world of social media, there are all sorts of things you can react to, in terms of criticism that all managers have - you have to rise above it.  

'Hatem trained with a different group to the group I trained with today. The disciplinary measures we have at the club go for all the players, not just Hatem. That procedure will remain in house and we’ll take care of it.'

Pardew admits he faces one of the biggest tests of his managerial career after coming under increasing pressure, with supporters calling for his head after a nightmare run of six straight defeats - the club’s worst top flight run for 27 years.

Fed-up fans are planning a mass second-half walkout during Saturday’s game against the Welsh side, but Pardew insists he and his under-fire players can weather the storm. He said: 'We have to be big enough and bold enough to cope with it. 

Protest: Newcastle fans have made their feelings about Pardew known

'I’ll fight for the position I have here at this club, because I’ve always been proud to have this job.  

'This has been the toughest run of results I’ve had as a manager and the most important thing is to get a performance that gets the stadium on our side to give us a platform to win the game.  

'You never want to see it a bad reaction from supporters as a manager of course, and when you get the results we’ve had you have to accept it.  

'The importance of the game is not lost on us we want to give our fans something back because we’ve let them down in recent weeks.'
