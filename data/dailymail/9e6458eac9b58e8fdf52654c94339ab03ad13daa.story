A woman who was sent to jail for benefit fraud was reported missing by her family because she did not tell them she faced prison.

Denise Dyson was so confident she would avoid jail despite wrongly claiming £22,000 from the taxpayer that she failed to tell anyone she was due in court.

So when she was sentenced to nine months in prison and taken straight from the courtroom to the cells, her family called the police and filed a missing person report.

Officers had to tell the worried relatives that Dyson, 60, was in fact in jail after being convicted of defrauding the State.

Dyson, from Wigan, used her maiden name to claim benefits, despite having married husband Terry in 2011.

Between 2006 and 2011, she received £22,000 more than she was owed in income support and council tax benefit by pretending she lived alone.

She was jailed for nine months in May, and was released after serving two months in prison.

But now Dyson has appeared at Manchester Crown Court again for a proceeds of crime hearing, during which she was ordered to pay back £25,856 within six months.

She was previously convicted in 2010 for working while receiving benefits, unlawfully claiming more than £9,000, and received a 12-month community order.

The court heard that Dyson is now estranged from her husband Terence, who is also subject to a court order forcing him to pay back £24,000 which he stole from his employer.

The 65-year-old was given a suspended sentence earlier this year after pleading guilty to three counts of theft.

The pair are now trying to sell their home in order to repay their ill-gotten gains.

Wigan councillor Terry Halliwell said: 'Wigan Council takes benefit fraud very seriously, as demonstrated in Mrs Dyson's case and the numerous others we've successfully prosecuted this year.

'Benefits are there for people who need them, who depend on them to live - not for those who think that they can get away with fraudulently claiming money.'

A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: 'When people receive benefits from us they enter into a contract to tell us of any change in their circumstances.

'Deliberately not doing so is a crime and takes valuable funds from those who need them the most.'
