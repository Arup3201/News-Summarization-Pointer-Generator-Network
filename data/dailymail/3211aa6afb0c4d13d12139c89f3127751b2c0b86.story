Britain's biggest police force wants to change the way crime is reported by getting rid of front desks in police stations and opening police counters in places such as Costa Coffee instead.

The Metropolitan Police Force is planning to axe 65 police counters in stations in London and replace them with high street contact points in coffee shops, faith centres and football stadiums.

A Costa coffee shop in Highgate, North London, has been designated for a
reporting counter, and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club has been earmarked for desk space, The Times reported.

The proposals will be forwarded to Boris

deputy for policing, next month

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We are considering replacing 65 under-used front counters across London 
with over 200 new contact points - either part of our estate, shared 
with partners or other public places - which would increase the amount 
of face-to-face contact we have with the public.'

Critics of the plan said it alienated victims who would be less inclined to report the crime, particularly crimes such as rape,  if they had to do so in the company of the coffee-drinking public.

David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, told The Times: 
'Going into a police station is often the last thing people want to do: 
they are often under emotional strain. This is not the environment in 
which you expect victims to be sharing the space with people drinking 
lattes. It’s a serious public service that requires serious public 
premises.'

The proposals have been under consideration by Met chiefs for the last six weeks and will be forwarded to Boris Johnson and the Mayor of London, and Stephen Greenhalgh, his deputy for policing next month.

It is hoped the proposals, along with the sale of Scotland Yard headquarter in Westminster will help the Met achieve its £500 million budget cuts target.

The plan to set up a replacement counter in the predominantly Jewish area of Golders Green, North London, on Fridays and Saturdays has been labelled 'culturally insensitive' by Andrew Dinsmore, the London Assembly member for Barnet, bearing in mind the Jewish holy day begins on Friday evening and ends on Saturday evening.

The Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We are reviewing our front 
counter services at police stations to see how effectively these 
services are used.

'We have looked closely at how many and 
what types of crime are reported in person at police stations, which 
will help inform any decisions to alter opening hours or close front 
counters whilst being there where victims need us.

'Public 
access to policing services has changed considerably in recent years. 
The introduction of the 101 non-emergency number and our ability to 
diary appointments for members of the public, coupled with internet 
access, means greater flexibility to access our services. 

'At 
least one police station per borough will provide access for the public 
24 hours a day, seven days a week. These 24-hour front counters will be 
improved to provide a better service for the public and will eventually 
include, for example, initial contact kiosks to provide instant access 
translation for the public.'
