West Ham manager Sam Allardyce remains positive ahead of the New Year's Day clash with West Brom despite his side having lost their last two Premier League matches.

The Hammers have unexpectedly been challenging for European places following a sensational start to the season that has seen them collect 31 points and stand sixth in the table at the end of 2014.

Consecutive defeats by Chelsea and Arsenal suggest West Ham are short of the main challengers for Champions League qualification, although Allardyce insists those results have not affected team morale.

Statistics from West Ham's 2-1 defeat by Arsenal prove that Allardyce is right to take heart from his team's performance.

The Hammers made a total of 385 passes compared to Arsenal's 294. 

West Ham had 57.8% possession against an Arsenal side renowned for keeping the ball. 

Their passing accuracy of 76.1% was more impressive than Arsenal's 66.3% - while their passing accuracy of 60.9% in the opposition half was also greater than Arsenal's 54.5%.

West Ham hit 41 crosses compared to Arsenal's 17.

'We need to make sure we're spot on and ensure there's no hangover from the two defeats,' he said.

'We've taken a lot of positives out of the Arsenal game because it's the first time we've ever out passed Arsenal.

'We'll take some confidence out of that and hopefully get onto the winning trail against West Brom.'

The Baggies will arrive at Upton Park without a manager after Alan Irvine was sacked following a dismal run of results, but Allardyce is purely focused on his own side's performance.

'For us it's about trying to re-establish our home results - whatever position West Brom are in, they're still a talented side,' he said.

'Injuries seem to be at a minimum which is good for us. James Tomkins is unfortunately suspended though. James Collins will come in and we also have Carl Jenkinson available again.'

Alan Irvine ran out of time after a dreadful run of results saw him sacked as West Brom manager

This time last year, there were calls from West Ham fans for Allardyce to be sacked and the durable manager is delighted at having turned things around.

'As a year, 2014 has brought us 56 points and that is a magnificent year,' he smiled.

'We came out of the dark side of January and since then we've had one magnificent year - from the football side and the financial side, too'.
