Striking images of New York mobsters from the dirty thirties have been revealed as they come up for auction.

Over 24 years, Eugene Canevari, a detective with the New York Police Department began working on cases involving some of the most well-know crime figures of the era: Lucky Luciano, Louis 'Lepke' Buchalter, Dutch Schultz and Vincent 'Mad Dog' Coll.

After retiring in 1952, Canevari took with him a number of police documents and photographs that charted his long career.

Revealed: The files of New York Detective Eugene S. Canevari will be auctioned next week

Now his files are up for auction and 
they include some incredible artifacts such as original mugshots of 
gangsters like Lucky Luciano and Johnny Torrio.

The files also contain various other police documents.

Canevari, who born in Greenwich Village, was on a first name basis with many of the mobsters he later prosecuted, having known several since childhood.

With a career beginning in 1928 at 
the age of 25, Canevari eventually rose to the rank of Detective 2nd 
Grade, mainly through his work on organized crime.

In
 addition to organized crime, he also worked on the NYPD Bomb Squad and 
Homicide Unit, not to mention his undercover work infiltrating Communist
 organizations.

Beyond the force, he also protected several celebrities including FDR, James Cagney, and Winston Churchill.

After a long and successful career, Canevari retired in 1952, at the age of 49, having served nearly 25 years.

Attempted train bombing: Fascinating collection related to an attempted train bombing, consisting of five original and seven typed witness statements, most dated February 15, 1930

In one part of the collection, photos depict the scene of an attempted bombing with dynamite on train tracks. A witness statement reads: 'There was a box of dynamite with a bomb wired up ready to explode…I volunteered to go down and take it out of the way as quickly as possible…I collected the sticks of dynamite…The full sticks of dynamite I put back in the box.' Another states: 'I looked down and I saw it was dynamite and said get away it is dynamite…When I got down on the track I took a stick in my hand and I looked at it. Then I knew it was dynamite.'

In the mafia assassination of Dutch Shultz a typed police report is up for sale. The incident is described in detail on now yellowing paper.

'A Tavern and Restaurant…was entered by three men and upon going to the rear of restaurant opened fire…four men received gun shot wounds of the body and were removed to Newark City Hospital…'

The notes taken at the time by a member of the Newark Police Department, at the bedside of Dutch Schultz, while he was talking irrationally, in a semi-conscious condition are also noted.

‘Please leave me alone Bugs, I was never a bad guy in my life, I’m not a rat. Tough sweating. Augie, I always though you were a rat but I did not think you would do this.’

The report concludes with a description of three unidentified suspects in the shooting. Schultz’s rambling last words became famous, and have been referenced and parodied in many works since.

Papers: The collection of NYPD reports and documents related to mobsters and complaints, dated from throughout the 1930s

The collection has various mug shots of criminals. Johnny Torrio's is filled out with a physical description and personal details on the reverse, listing his crime as 'Forging In,' occupation as 'Real Estate,' and date of arrest as '4-28-36,' although the date on the identification card in the photo is April 22, 1936.

Torrio was arrested on a forgery indictment for passing a bad promissory note; he subsequently plead guilty to income tax evasion and served two years in prison.

His arrest made headlines throughout the nation, as bail was set at a whopping $100,000 — which Torrio’s wife quickly delivered to the courthouse in cash.

Charles 'Lucky' Luciano was instrumental in the development of organised crime across the United States.

In this mugshot from February 1931, Luciano was indicted on two counts of assault in the first degree, both of which were dismissed. This mug shot is probably the most iconic image of Luciano, and clearly shows the droopy eye which he suffered as a result of an earlier stabbing.

A major turning point came later in 1931, when Joe Masseria was assassinated at Luciano’s command, allowing him to take over as the first official boss of the Genovese crime family.

Capone became involved with gang activity at a young age after being expelled from school at age 14. he spent eight years in prison between 1931 and 1939. In 1947, he died from a heart attack after suffering a stroke.

Across town New York mobster Joe Adonis was committing other crimes. As a part of his criminal empire, Adonis owned a number of car dealerships in New Jersey, where customers were intimidated into buying ‘protection insurance’ for their vehicle.

Vincent 'Mad Dog' Coll was assassinated by rivals while in a phone booth at age 23. In photo all are charged in connection with the shooting death of Michael Vengalli, a five-year-old child. Coll earned his nickname in the aftermath, when New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker dubbed him ‘Mad Dog.’
