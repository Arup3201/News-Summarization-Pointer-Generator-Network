This is the golden age of satellite surveillance, radar, sonar and advanced telecommunications and tracking devices. 

Losing anything the size of a jet aircraft or a hundred thousand tonne yacht seemed impossible, until the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 last year.

The doomed flight proved that things can go wrong - and missing - regardless of what decade you are in and explanations can  be hard to find.

Regardless of what decade you are in things can go wrong and often explanations are hard to find

Just weeks ago climbers in the Andes stumbled on the mangled remains of a crashed airplane that the Chilean nation had mourned the inexplicable loss of for over half a century.

The flight had been carrying  almost an entire football team when it vanished and its location turned out to be many miles from where experts predicted, 

Here MailOnline Travel looks at some of the world's most extraordinary travel mysteries, and whether they've been solved...

The missing Chilean football team 

It was 54 years ago - on April 3 1961 - that a flight carrying 24 people including eight top footballers all but evaporated into thin air. 

The sports stars were from the Chilean team Green Cross and were returning after a 1-1 draw in Osorno to Santiago as part of the coveted domestic cup Copa de Chile.

The team and staff were spread over two flights and while one of the planes reached the Chilean capital the other never did. 

The fate of those on board became one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in South America and caused a national outcry as well as funerals for the missing players attended by massive crowds.

This month it was reported that a team of climbers had found the twisted wreckage of the Douglas DC-3, high up in the Andes in the Maule region about 300 kilometres south of Santiago - far from from were initial accounts and rescue missions had placed it.

'It was a breathtaking moment, and we felt all kinds of sensations. One could feel the energy of the place and breathe the pain,' expedition member Leonardo Albornoz told Chile's Channel 7, according to the Associated Press. 

The exact location of the wreckage is remaining a secret not prevent looters.  

Skydiving plane hijacker 

Whichever way you look at this, it's an impressive stunt. In 1971 someone known  as 'DB Cooper' aka Dan Cooper boarded a Boeing 727 from Oregon to Seattle wearing a suit and sunglasses. 

Shortly after takeoff he lit a cigarette, ordered a whisky and passed a flight attendant a note explaining that he had a bomb and was hijacking the plane. He demanded $200,000 upon landing and a parachute. The pilot radioed his demands and the authorities complied.

A passenger named Dan Cooper boarded a Boeing 727 from Oregon to Seattle then held it to ransom in 1971

He allowed passengers to depart before ordering the pilot to takeoff once more (with the money). Somewhere over the lower Cascade mountains in southwestern Washington he parachuted from the plane to a highly dubious fate. 

DB Cooper was never seen or heard of again despite the last four decades seeing more than 1,000 suspects  considered. 

Four years ago a woman came forward claiming to be the DB Cooper's niece.

She said she saw her uncle - a man named Lynn Doyle Cooper - badly injured the day after the incident when she was eight years old. He said he had been in a car crash and then promptly vanished out of her life forever. She believes he died in 1999. The case has now been closed.

Pioneering pilot Amelia Earhart

On an ill-fated flight over the Pacific Ocean on July 2 1937 aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart went missing.

The 39-year-old US famed pilot was nearing the end of a record breaking attempt to fly the longest route around-the-world and had become somewhat of a celebrity.

During one of the last longest and dangerous legs of the journey from Lae, Papa New Guinea to Howland Island Earhart something went very wrong.

Radio transmissions stalled, the weather was cloudy and she and her navigator, Fred Noonan, were running out of fuel. Before takeoff they had tried to make way for extra fuel by  throwing out every non-essential item, but it wasn't enough. 

One of the last radio messages from her to the island was recorded as: 'We must be on you, but we cannot see you. Fuel is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet.'

A fragment from her plane was found near Nikumaroro, an uninhabited atoll in the  Pacific republic of Kiribati

Theories rained hard after the disappearance but the closest anyone has got at an explanation was when a  fragment  from her plane was found near Nikumaroro, an uninhabited atoll in the southwestern Pacific republic of Kiribati, in 1991, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island. 

Last year, experts confirmed they did indeed believe the aluminium fragment found was part of Earhart's plane, used as to fill in a navigation window when the aircraft stopped in Miami.

Some experts believe the couple may have landed on the coral reef   as castaways and eventually died on the atoll.

Bermuda Triangle

In case you want to avoid it, the famous mythical stretch of Atlantic Ocean is roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda and Puerto Rico and is the location where dozens of ships and airplanes have vanished over the years. A snapshot of strange occurrences reads as follows:

In 1945 six US navy bombers disappeared, as did those who went to rescue them. Before they vanished one of the pilots saud, 'Everything looks strange, even the ocean.' 

On average four aircraft and 20 yachts go missing there every year. Pilot Bruce Gernon claims he inexplicably jumped 28 minutes forward in time and 100 miles forward in space here, and has since written a book about it.

In 1955 a yacht that survived three hurricanes was found minus all its crew. 

Experts assure us that most mishaps are due to weather and human error but  more outlandish explanations include everything from gas deposits and aliens to 'crystal' interference from the City of Atlantis thought to be somewhere beneath the waves.

Death ship 

Depending on who you speak to, in June 1947 or February 1948 a disturbing distress call was picked up by multiple ships from the Dutch cargo ship SS Ourang Medan. It said, 'All officers including captain are dead, lying in chartroom and bridge. Possibly whole crew dead.'

This terrible message was followed by a flurry of Morse code, then a final, grim two words: 'I die.'

A US merchant ship Silver Star headed to the scene and found all its members of crew, including the ship's dog, dead. According to reports their eyes were wide open and faces twisted in frozen horror. The ship soon after exploded and sank.

No one has ever come close to an explanation but many have speculated at ghosts, dangerous chemicals and even aliens causing the bizarre incident.

MH370 Malaysia Airlines

When it comes to recent travel tragedies, none is perhaps more so at the forefront of our minds than missing MH370 Malaysia Airlines. 

En route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014 the flight carrying 239 people lost contact less than an hour after take-off.

No distress calls were made and very little more is known about what happened. In the months that followed the world watched as a huge rescue operation began, spanning almost three million square miles from Kazakhstan to remote areas of the Indian Ocean. 

Based on satellite data best estimates place the wreckage somewhere far west of Australian city of Perth. 

Last year Reuters estimated that $44 million had been spent on the hunt and that figure was expected to run into the hundreds of millions, making it the most expensive search in aviation history.

So far search teams have not found a single trace of the plane or its passengers. 

In the following months a vast rescue operation  spanning almost three million square miles was launched
