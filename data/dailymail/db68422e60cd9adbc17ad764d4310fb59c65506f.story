A message claiming Celtic were 'raped' in a Champions League tie and should not have been reinstated into the competition has appeared on the Twitter account of former Rangers player Vladimir Weiss.

Celtic were reprieved by UEFA on Friday morning after it emerged their third qualifying round opponents Legia Warsaw fielded a suspended player in the second leg at Murrayfield in Edinburgh.

The tweet, which was sent out to 81,000 followers on Slovakia international Weiss' official account, read: 'Un f***** believable... Got raped 6:1!!! Should never be allowed to play champions league after that.. Embarrassing #f***celtic #watp'.

Controversial: This message relating to the decision to reinstate Celtic to the Champions League after third qualifying round opponents Legia Warsaw fielded an ineligible player appeared on the Twitter account of former Rangers player Vladimir Weiss

Suspended: Bartosz Bereszynski, who was banned for three games following a red card, played three minutes for Legia Warsaw in the second leg of their Champions League third qualifying round tie with Celtic

The tweet prompted a backlash against the choice of words and was retweeted over 3,000 times.

Winger Weiss played for Rangers on loan from Manchester City during the 2010-2011 season, making 35 appearances for the Ibrox club and scoring five times. 

A UEFA disciplinary panel took the decision to reinstate Celtic after their Polish opponents Legia fielded a suspended player, Bartosz Bereszynski, for three minutes of their third qualifying round, second leg tie at Murrayfield on Wednesday night.

Legia won both legs of the tie - 4-1 at home and 2-0 away - to win 6-1 on aggregate.

But a UEFA disciplinary meeting convened before the European draws in Nyon decided Celtic should be awarded a 3-0 second leg victory - and advance on away goals - after Legia fielded suspended defender Bereszynski.

Red carded against Cypriots Apollon Limassol in a Europa League game last season Bereszynski was supposed to serve his suspension in UEFA competition this season.

Unregistered for the second qualifying win over St Patrick's Athletic, however, the first opportunity to serve his ban came with during the Celtic tie.

His late appearance as a substitute in the second leg was reported to the governing body by the UEFA match delegate leading to his eligibility being investigated.

After being reinstated into the competition, Celtic were drawn against Maribor in the play-off round.

Weiss, who now plays for Lekhwiya in the Qatar Stars League, still has a picture of himself in a Rangers kit on his Twitter profile.

The hashtag 'watp' refers to the popular Rangers chant and motto 'We are the People'.

The comment led to criticism on Twitter, with one follower replying: 'bad choice of words, raped? REALLY?'

Another responded: 'Not really comfortable with your use of the word "rape" here.'

Alan Pardew, now manager of Newcastle United, was heavily criticised after using the word 'rape' on an episode of the BBC's Match of the Day 2 programme back in 2009.

Describing an ineffective challenge by Manchester City player Ched Evans on Chelsea's Michael Essien, Pardew said: 'Ched Evans is a strong boy but Essien knocked him off the ball. He absolutely rapes him there.'

He was condemned by women's groups and was forced to issue an 'unconditional apology' through the BBC.
