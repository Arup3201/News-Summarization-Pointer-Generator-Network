She might be just a year old but little Mia Grace Tindall is no stranger to the family business - horses.

The toddler and her mother Zara Phillips, 33, spent Sunday at the Heythrop Hunt Point-to-Point races at Cocklebarrow Farm in Gloucestershire.

Zara, who combines a career in training with eventing, had two runners: Devil's Boy, a horse owned by Anton Palmer, which ran in the first race, and her own horse Frankenstorm.

Zara Phillips and her daughter Mia Grace attended the Heythrop Hunt Point-to-Point races at Cocklebarrow Farm in Gloucestershire together earlier today 

Zara and Mia were both wrapped up warm against the bitterly cold weather and displayed near identical grey bobble hats

The mother-of-one watched the first race from the sidelines accompanied by her best friend Dolly Maude, who kept a close eye on Mia.

One member of the family was missing however, with Zara's husband Mike Tindall currently in Austria competing in the reality TV series The Jump.

Dressed down in mud spattered boot, blue jeans, a grey hoodie and dark blue puffa jacket, Zara was ready to face all of the elements on a freezing winter's day.

Dolly Maude kept Mia entertained as Zara kept an eye on her horse as it raced 

Zara, who trains horses, had two runners entered, Devil's Boy' owned by Mr Anton Palmer who ran in the first race, and her own horse 'Frankenstorm'

Her daughter was decked out in a similar grey bobble hat to her mother and wore a blue padded gilet, along with some large ski gloves to protect her hands against the chill. 

Zara expertly manoeuvred Mia's pushchair around the muddy field as she headed to the finish line for a better view of the action.

The ladies laughed and joked, while keeping Mia entertained as they waited for the race to start.

Zara's daughter should feel at home in equestrian circles by now - the royal has been taking her to meets regularly since she was just a few months old.
