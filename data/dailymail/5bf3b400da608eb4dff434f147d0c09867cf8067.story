A white man who shot dead a black 17-year-old during an argument over loud music at a gas station has been found guilty of first-degree murder.

Michael Dunn showed no emotion as he was convicted of the November 2012 murder of Jordan Davis, whom he killed when he fired 10 times into an SUV carrying four teens, WJAX reported.

After the verdict, Davis' parents Ron Davis and Lucia MacBath both let out a quiet gasp then hung their heads and cried, CNN reported. Dunn later turned and shook his head at his father.

The 47-year-old software developer faces life in prison without parole when he is sentenced. A tentative sentencing date was set for October 17 but it will be confirmed next week.

He had already been convicted of three counts of attempted second-degree murder in February and faces at least 60 years in prison on those counts alone. 

But in February, the jury was deadlocked on the first-degree murder count, meaning it had to go to trial again this month. 

The jury reached its verdict in the retrial on Wednesday after more than five hours of deliberations. 

The shooting unfolded after a shouting match between Dunn and the group of teenagers in a car at a gas station in November 2012.

Dunn, who had just left his son's wedding, asked Davis and the other teens in the car to turn down the music and a shouting match erupted between Dunn and Davis, who was sitting in the passenger side of the car. 

Dunn is accused of firing 10 times into the SUV, including several times as the driver tried to get away.

One of the shots killed Davis. No one else in the SUV was injured.

Earlier in the trial, prosecutor John Guy said Dunn fired at the SUV 'with malice in his heart and intent in his hand' and intended to kill the boy.

'He wasn't shooting at the tires. He wasn't shooting at the windows. He was shooting to kill, aiming at Jordan Davis,' prosecutor Erin Wolfson said.

The defense argued that Dunn had shot at the car repeatedly because he felt in imminent danger.

The four teenagers were unarmed and no weapons were found inside their car.

During testimony this week, Dunn's fiancee told how they went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes straight after the killing.

Rhonda Rouer, who was inside the store when the shooting happened, said she heard shots and was immediately told to get in the car by Dunn, who drove them back to their hotel.

The couple then ordered a meal, made drinks and went to bed.

The next morning when she woke up, the TV was on and she said she saw that Davis had died and she told Dunn she wanted to go home.

They drove straight back to Satellite Beach, canceling plans to have lunch with Dunn's son.

Dunn was arrested after they returned home that afternoon.
