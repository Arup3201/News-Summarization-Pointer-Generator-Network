Bayern Munich are listed by many bookmakers as favourites to win the Champions League this season – rated above even Real Madrid and Barcelona. 

The German champions are unbeaten in 22 matches in all competitions, so what price Manchester City to stop the Guardiola juggernaut on Tuesday night in order to keep their own European hopes alive? It is certainly a daunting task as you can see.

Sportsmail takes a look at six reasons why Bayern are almost impossible to beat.

1. They have the best goalkeeper in the world

Manuel Neuer has taken the No1 position to new levels, becoming the ultimate sweeper-keeper that every other top club in the world is trying to replicate.

Not only is he like an extra defender if teams try to get in behind the back-four, he is utterly commanding on set-pieces, successfully claiming 95% of the corners, free-kicks and crosses he went for in the Bundesliga last season.

Winner of the Golden Gloves for being the best goalkeeper at the last World CupThom, he has repaid every penny of the £18million it cost Bayern to lure him from Schalke in 2011,

2. They have the best manager in the world

Jose Mourinho is the only serious rival to Guardiola's crown, and Pep fans will recall how his Barcelona side totally humiliated Mourinho's Real 5-0 in the famous 2010 Clasico.

Guardiola gave the world tiki-taka at Barcelona, winning the Champions League twice, and has reinvented himself in Munich, responding to heavy defeats against Real Madrid last season by giving his side greater physical strength through summer signings Robert Lewandowski, Xabi Alonso, Juan Bernat and Mehdi Benatia – without losing any of the flair.

Manchester City keep a close eye on Guardiola's tactical reformation in case he shows any interest in succeeding Manuel Pellegrini in 18 months time.

3. They are proven winners

Bayern have won the last two German League titles and are already seven points clear this season after an unbeaten start to the campaign.

Besides that, six of their team – Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Philipp Lahm (currently injured), Mario Gotze, Thomas Muller and Bastian Schweinsteiger won the World Cup with Germany this summer.

Gotze scored the only goal in the final against Argentina and 2010 World Cup winner Alonso was added to an already star-studded Bayern squad in the last transfer window.

4. Bayern love Manchester

Arjen Robben's spectacular late strike against Manchester United at Old Trafford in 2010 took the Germans through to the Champions League final on the away goals rule.

Last season, they visited Manchester twice and enjoyed highly satisfactory results on both occasions.

Goals from Franck Ribery, Muller and Robben earned them a deserved 3-1 win at Manchester City in the group stages. And they returned to the north-west for a quarter-final against United, earning a 1-1 draw in the first leg at Old Trafford that set up an easy second-leg win.

5. They have new attacking teeth

If there was one criticism about Pep Guardiola's teams, it was they occasionally over-played and didn't make their possession superiority count in terms of goals.

You couldn't say that about Bayern this season. They have scored 31 goals in 12 Bundesliga games and conceded only three.

At the weekend, they won 4-0 away to Eintracht Frankfurt with Muller scoring a hat-trick and Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri also netting. Those Bayern fans who complained last season the team was less exciting under Guardiola than his predecessor Jupp Heynckes have been silenced. Their last three away games have yielded 14 goals, including seven at Roma in their last Champions League fixture outside Munich.

6. They have English know-how

Arjen Robben was a Premier League title winner at Chelsea, and has improved immeasurably since then. If Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are the best two players in the world, the Dutchman is considered by many to be the third-best on current form.

Alonso won the Champions League with Liverpool and regularly topped the statistics for making the most tackles in matches, beside being an excellent playmaker.

Boateng had one unhappy season at City, starting only 14 Premier League games, but knows the stadium well. And on the bench is Pepe Reina, who spent nine seasons as a Liverpool player.

AND SOME CRUMBS OF COMFORT...

Bayern have already qualified for the knockout stages and Pep Guardiola admits his team aren't at their best when too relaxed. Recent history supports that, last season Arsenal forced a draw in Munich after losing the first leg 2-0, while City actually won at the Olympic Stadium in the group stages when Bayern knew they could afford to lose and still progress into the last 16 as group winners.
