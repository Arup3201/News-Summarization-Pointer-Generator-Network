James Ward crashed out of the Aegon International in straight sets against American Donald Young to end the British men’s chances in Eastbourne with barely a whimper.

Ward warmed up for Wimbledon  next week — where he has been granted a wildcard — by winning just 49 per cent of points on his first serve during a disappointing 6-3, 6-2 defeat.

The world No 155 would have hoped to trouble Young more on this surface given that 11 of his 18 career ATP tour wins have come on grass. But he failed to manufacture a single break point as Young prevailed in just one hour and three minutes.

Grounds for complaint: James Ward has won 11 of his 18 tour matches on grass but couldn't add another

Heather 
Watson launched a stirring comeback to beat former Wimbledon 
semi-finalist Tsvetana Pironkova and reach the second round of the Aegon
 International at Eastbourne.

Watson
 looked set to continue her poor start to the grass-court season as she 
trailed the Bulgarian, ranked 33 places above the Briton at 37 in the 
world.

But
 Watson rallied to break her opponent at the crucial point of the second
 set before turning on the style in the decider to wrap up an impressive
 3-6 7-5 6-2 win in two hours and 14 minutes.

Her
 compatriot Johanna Konta, meanwhile, sought to play down her 6-3, 6-2 
victory over rising star Belinda Bencic. The British No 3 lives in 
Eastbourne and was cheered by her parents Gabriella Cortez and Gabor 
Konta.

Bright spark: Heather Watson came back from a set down to kick off her grass court campaign in Eastbourne

The 23-year-old 
came from a break down in the second set and squandered eight match 
points before eventually overcoming Bencic, who is just 17.

‘It was a good win but no more than that,’ said the Briton.

Konta
 will today face the talented but erratic Italian Camila Giorgi in the 
next round. Giorgi beat former world No 1 Victoria Azarenka 4-6, 6-3, 
7-5 in two hours and 47 minutes.

Azarenka,
 who has not played a tournament since Indian Wells in March, did not 
seem to lack sharpness on her return from a foot injury but was undone 
several times by Giorgi’s blockbuster backhand.

Konta
 should be aware of Giorgi’s Argentine coach and father Sergio, who 
seems to live every point with his daughter. Sergio was asked to be 
quiet by umpire Alison Lang, and celebrated wildly after Azarenka 
double-faulted to drop serve.

Azarenka will go into Wimbledon, where she has never advanced beyond the last four, having played just 11 matches this year.

‘You
 don’t have any more tournaments, so you’ve just got to go with it,’ 
said Azarenka. ‘The important thing is that I got at least one match 
under my belt. I tested myself in competition, and that’s what I came 
here for. I wanted to play for a long time, to see how my body is going 
to react.’
