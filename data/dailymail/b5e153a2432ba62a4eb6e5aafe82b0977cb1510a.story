Casey Anthony's defence team have been branded insensitive and loutish after they were spotted celebrating their court victory with a lavish champagne party.

In an unapologetic display many have slammed as inappropriate considering the serious nature of their case, Jose Baez and his team were seen downing drinks as they watched reaction to their client being found not guilty of brutally murdering her two-year-old child Caylee.

Stunned onlookers gasped and shouted abuse to protest the scenes, while high-profile commentators were clearly outraged, with one comparing the scenes to the work of the devil.

Appropriate? Defense attorney Cheney Mason makes an obscene gesture

The sensational acquittal of Casey Anthony after a dramatic six-week trial has stunned America, with angry spectators comparing the trialâ€™s outcome to the infamous verdict in the OJ Simpson case.

Anthony, 25, is poised to walk free tomorrow morning and sell her story for millions, after the jury failed to find her guilty of the murder of her daughter Caylee.

But inside trendy restaurant 
Terrace 390 in Orlando, where waiters carry iPads and beer sells for as 
little as $3, the party-loving young mother's defence team celebrated and drank with complete disregard for the strength of feeling surrounding them.

'Champagne toast': Cheney Mason knocks back a drink with colleagues

Were jury right to acquit Casey Anthony of murdering her daughter?

At one point, attorney 
Cheney Mason could be seen making an obscene gesture to an angry crowd 
outside, an apparent gesture of contempt towards anyone who dares 
criticise the team.

As the group mingled with TV personality Geraldo Rivera, fellow defence lawyer Dorothy Clay 
Sims was then spotted jigging up and down, performing a victory dance for 
her colleagues before turning her phone towards outraged onlookers to 
film their shocked reactions.

Commentators,
led invariably by the notoriously vocal Nancy Grace, immediately 
reacted with rage to footage showing the unapologetic celebrations.

Grace showed the video on television last night as a focus for her frustrations about the outcome of the high-profile case.

25-year-old
defendant Casey was sensationally acquitted yesterday of first-degree 
murder and is poised to walk free tomorrow morning after the jury failed
to find her guilty of the murder of her daughter Caylee.

Speaking about the post-trial party, Grace said:
'The defence team is inside a bar having a champagne toast right now. 
Now you know what? I'm not a preacher and I'm not a rabbi but there's 
something wrong with that.

Dis-grace: Nancy was not impressed by the antics

'Because Caylee is dead and her body 
decomposed just fifteen houses away from where the Anthony's put their 
head on the pillow every night, every day searching for this little 
girl.'

She went on with typical hyperbole, suggesting the scenes of celebration were so cruel the devil would be dancing.

She
said: 'Now I know it is our duty as American citizens to respect the 
jury system and I do, believe me I do. I've struck over a hundred 
juries.

'But I know 
one thing. As the defence sits by and has their champagne toast after 
that not guilty verdict, somewhere out there, the devil is dancing 
tonight.'

Outside the restaurant, onlookers were shocked that the party was going on.

One spectator, Patrick Fowler, from Orlando, called out for Baez to leave the restaurant, which the attorney ignored, while drinking what appeared to be a beer.

A few minutes later, colleague Mason 
approached the window and made the obscene gesture with his hand, which 
was caught on camera.

Wanda
Tyler, from Orlando, told the Orlando Sentinel: 'They shouldn't be 
celebrating. A little girl is dead and they helped her killer go free.'

A spokesman for the Terrace 390 restaurant said: 'We would like to remind everyone that we do not dictate who walks through our doors.

'In no way does our clientele reflect our personal thoughts or opinions on the outcome of any legal or political proceedings.'

Meanwhile, the prosecution have spoken of their surprise at the verdict.

Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton,
who led the prosecution, said this morning that he was 'shocked' and 
disappointed by the jury's decision, which he believes came down to 
'cause of death'.

'I don't think it was the lack of DNA' linking Anthony to her daughter's death that undermined the case, Mr Ashton said. 'It was the cause of death.'

'We were pretty shocked' at the not guilty verdict, he said. 'We put on everything that an investigation, a really thorough investigation over three years, produced. That's the way it goes. I think I mouthed "Wow" five times.'

Mr Ashton, who is retiring after this case, said that he believes one of the most powerful pieces of evidence was the photo of Caylee's decomposed skull with pieces of duct tape where her mouth and nose would have been.

'What I've said all along is if a jury looks at that photograph and doesn't see it the way I do and doesn't know how she died, then so be it,' Mr Ashton told The View.

'I wouldn't have been involved in this case if I didn't think she did it.'
