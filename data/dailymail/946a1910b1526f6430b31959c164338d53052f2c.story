Derby are a team who struggle for goals but don’t concede any either - or so we were told. Both of those statistics vanished at the Valley, the latter of which largely thanks to the mistakes of their captain, Richard Keogh.

It was his error that gifted Queens Park Rangers a place in the Premier League at Wembley in May, and the central defender suffered at Charlton, his mishaps offering the hosts three points on a plate.

Keogh - at the bedrock of a back four to have kept three consecutive clean sheets before this - was caught a yard off George Tucudean for the first goal and brought down the same man for the second during a game which raised questions over Derby’s promotion credentials.

The Rams were the pre-season smart money after the play-off final defeat But they have now endured an indifferent start, even with four points on the board. Steve McClaren had chosen to lament the fact his main men have been unable to find the net so far this season. Their league tally stood at one - Jeff Hendrick’s late winner against Rotherham on the opening day. A striking statistic, given this is the same side to have scored more than anyone else last season, even eventual champions Leicester City.

The problem at Charlton was the disarray in which his back four was thrown with such ease. Keogh and Jake Buxton looked uncomfortable for large parts.

‘You can’t win a game if you concede three goals like we did,’ McClaren said. ‘We reached such high levels last season that you expect to get back into the groove. That takes a while.’

It wasn’t ideal, therefore, that they came up against a rejuvenated and revamped Charlton here. For all the good groundwork laid by Chris Powell - sacked in March - this the Addicks are now a side insistent on playing a certain way under Bob Peeters. They play with width and want to entertain.

‘This is the best I’ve seen us play,’ the manager said. ‘Derby didn’t have an answer. We were passing the ball very well.’

It helps having someone of Johann Gudmundsson’s quality operating as a heartbeat. A roaming wide midfielder capable of going short and long when need-be, the Scandinavian cut is teeth at Chelsea and Fulham as a teenager. It was he, now 23 and formerly of AZ Alkmaar, who sprayed a clever ball wide to Jordan Cousins for the opening goal. Cousins set about attacking Cyrus Christie before crossing to Tucudean, who easily escaped Keogh, span and smashed beyond Lee Grant.

Great effort: Jamie Ward (being lifted up) is over the moon with his spectacular equaliser, but Derby went onto lose

Gudmundsson had already gone close earlier, but Derby found themselves level. Martin stung the palms of Pope, Hendrick kept the attack alive on the byline before laying back - via a super Craig Bryson step-over - to Ward, whose arrowed effort into the top corner was breathtakingly unstoppable.

Craig Bryson went close as well as Hendrick but full league debutant Nick Pope thwarted the pair. A head of steam was on its way, but they couldn’t compensate for another uncharacteristic Keogh gaffe, as he hauled Tucudean down in the box for Yoni Buyens to convert a second seconds prior to the break.

Substitute Franck Moussa, who replaced the injured Tucudean, went close from Johnnie Jackson’s clever cutback. That mattered little, though, with the points seemingly wrapped up 12 minutes from time. As McClaren threw on targetman Leon Best, the impressive Igor Vetokele was left all alone in the six-yard box to calmly nod into an empty net from Laurie Wilson’s centre.

Derby were offered a late lifeline they scarcely deserved after a dreadful Pope mistake - the goalkeeper allowing a tame Ward drive through his legs - but failed to capitalise on the obvious nerves swelling the ground.

Peeters, who refused to criticise his young No 2, was buoyant - not quite as much as after the stoppage-time winner against Wigan at the weekend - and already has this club, dormant only a matter of months ago, dreaming of a season much more profitable than the last.

Among the relegation favourites at the start of the month, Charlton remain unbeaten. ‘Never trust the bookies,’ Peeters smiled.
