Rickie Lambert is set fulfil his boyhood dream of playing Liverpool against the club he left earlier this summer.

In an ironic twist of fate, the Merseysiders will face Southampton on the opening day of the season.

Lambert made the move to Liverpool, the club he supported as a boy, from St Mary's in a £4million move earlier this month.

Debut: Rickie Lambert could make open his Liverpool account against his former club Southampton

And fitness permitting the striker is in line to make his Reds debut versus his previous employers.

In signing for Liverpool, Lambert said: 'I can't believe it, I've loved this club all my life. I left here 17 years ago - and I haven't stopped loving it since.

'I have always dreamt of playing for Liverpool, but I did kind of think the chance of playing for them had gone. I didn't think the chance would come.

'I know how big Liverpool are - and it means everything to me - but I know what is important; I know it's what I do on the pitch and the minutes I play. 

'I know that's what matters, and that's what I'll be focused on.' The fairytale scenario for Lambert would be to score in on his Reds bow against his former club.

But with either Daniel Sturridge or Luis Suarez likely to occupy the lone striker's role on the opening day of the season, it remains to be seen whether Lambert will feature against Ronald Koeman's men.

However, should the England international score, he will join an illustrious group of Liverpool strikers to have scored on their debuts for the club.

Daniel Sturridge v Mansfield (FA Cup) - January 6, 2013

Having joined from Chelsea, the striker made an instant impact by scoring on his debut in the FA Cup third round clash against Mansfield. He then scored on his league bow, netting in the 2-1 defeat at Manchester United before scoring again in his next game against Norwich.

Luis Suarez v Stoke (Premier League) - February 2, 2011

Having arrived from Ajax for £22.8million, much was expected of the Uruguayan. And he delivered instantly, scoring on his debut against Stoke as the Merseysiders ran-out 2-0 winners. He hasn't stopped scoring since.

Craig Bellamy v Maccabi Haifa (Champions League) - August 9, 2006

A few eyebrows were raised when Rafa Benitez forked out £6million to sign the temperamental Welshman, but it looked money well spent when he scored on his debut to help Liverpool to victory against Maccabi Haifa in a crucial Champions League qualifier.

Stan Collymore v Sheff Wed (Premier League) August 19, 1995

Robbie Fowler v Fulham (League Cup) Sept 22, 1993

The Liverpool legend, as you'd expect, scored on his debut as the Reds beat Fulham 3-1 in the League Cup at Craven Cottage. Fowler then scored all five in the second leg at Anfield a week later to truly announce himself on the big stage.

Michael Owen v Wimbledon (Premier League) May 6 1997

With Liverpool needing victory to stay in the title race and 2-0 down at Wimbledon, Roy Evans threw on a 17-year-old striker from the academy. Owen made an instant impact by halving the deficit - but he couldn't prevent his side from falling to defeat at Selhurst Park.

Andrei Voronin v Toulouse (Champions League)  - August 15, 2007

This
 wasn't his debut, but his first start. Having come on for 10 minutes in
 the 2-1 win over Aston Villa a few days earlier, Rafa Benitez handed to
 Ukrainian his full debut in the Champions League qualifier against 
Toulouse - and Voronin scored the winner. And he scored in his next two,
 as well.

Djibril Cisse v Tottenham (Premier League) - August 14, 2004

Arriving
 with a hefty £14million price tag, Cisse failed to find the net on his 
full debut which came against Graz in a Champions League qualifier - but
 he did score on his league bow, notching in the 1-1 draw against 
Tottenham.

Milan Baros v Bolton (Premier League) - Sept 14, 2002

With
 just two  brief substitute appearances under his belt, the Czech 
striker christened his first star with a brace against Bolton at the 
Reebok Stadium in a 3-2 win.

Patrik Berger v Leicester (Premier League) - Sept 15, 1996

Having
 caused a stir at Euro 96, much was expected of the Czech. He failed to 
find the back of the net coming on as a late substitute against 
Southampton to make his debut - but he scored twice on his first start 
at Filbert Street and followed up that brace with two more against 
Chelsea the week after in a 5-1 win.
