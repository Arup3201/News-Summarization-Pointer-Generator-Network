Swansea City manager Garry Monk believes Gylfi Sigurdsson should not have been sent off despite having 'a lunge' during their 3-1 FA Cup fourth-round defeat at second tier Blackburn Rovers on Saturday.

Swansea defender Kyle Bartley was dismissed after seven minutes for a foul on Josh King as the Blackburn forward raced through on goal while Sigurdsson left the Premier League side with nine men following a rash tackle on Chris Taylor.

'It warranted a yellow, but I don't think it was a red,' said Monk.

'He (Sigurdsson) had a lunge after he was kicked. He shouldn't react, but it wasn't dangerous. I don't think he was in any danger of hurting the player.'

Iceland international Sigurdsson had put Swansea in front but Blackburn equalised through Taylor before Rudy Gestede and Craig Conway struck late on to send the Championship side into the fifth round.

Swansea were thrashed 5-0 at home by Premier League leaders Chelsea last weekend and Monk was hoping for a morale-boosting victory over six-times FA Cup winners Blackburn.

'It's a disappointing result to go out of the Cup,' Monk said. 'We wanted to get back on track, but unfortunately we couldn't do that today.

'We're in a difficult moment after the last two games, but it's important we come through it together.'
