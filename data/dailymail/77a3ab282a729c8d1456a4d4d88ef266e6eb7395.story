The $7.8 million sale set a record price in the St George District, despite the owner's hopes for a $8 million pricetag, and it was also the biggest Sydney sale of the week.

The 980 square metre block of land, which is in close proximity to shopping precincts, the airport and Sydney CBD, cost $2,765,000 in 2002.
