A football team finds a level in the end. For this season, possibly beyond, Celtic’s level will be the Europa League. On this evidence, that may be no bad thing.

Ronny Deila’s team crafted a useful 1-1 draw in the away game in Maribor. But the solid foundations of the first leg collapsed in catastrophic fashion 15 minutes from time.

Make no mistake, there will be no UEFA reprieve from this.

Galling is the knowledge that, at 0-0, Scotland’s champions were through. A scoreless draw would have been sufficient to secure a third successive season of Champions League group-stage football.

But this is an under-resourced Celtic team with deep problems. The greatest of which is defending. Evidence Emilio Izaguirre, the fall guy of this debilitating defeat.

The Honduran left-back was once the next big thing. With Beram Kayal, he was the shining light in Celtic’s fabled transfer system. Now he can do little right.

He was guilty of the wretched piece of defending which allowed Maribor’s captain Marcos Tavares to hook a deflected shot home in a crowded penalty area in 75 minutes, a defensive header landing his own team bang in trouble.

From the moment the ball nestled in the net, Celtic were effectively out.

On a night of abject frustration and disjointed play, they rarely looked like scoring. In the third of four minutes of injury time they should, somehow, have salvaged extra-time when Virgil van Dijk — pushed up as an emergency centre-forward — blew a wonderful chance from eight yards.

And yet, after two years of performing in the group stage and downsizing, Celtic’s chickens have come home to roost.

Striker Stefan Scepovic will sign for £2.4million in the next 24 hours. But like Mubarak Wakaso and Aleksandar Tonev, the Serbian’s arrival is too little, too late.

At time up, Maribor players and officials leapt and cavorted in disbelief on the pitch.

They were an average team, but less average than Celtic. Both they and Celtic got what they deserved.

Inevitably, there will be questions asked of Deila once more after this. His team were humiliated by Legia Warsaw, advancing on a technicality at the say-so of UEFA’s disciplinary committee. They weren’t good enough then and to exit the competition twice in one season is grim stuff.

There was a naivety to the way he chased victory here. In the end the decision to sacrifice three points in Inverness on Saturday proved hopelessly misjudged.

In truth, no one expected what transpired here. Maribor were dominated in Slovenia but turned the tables on a night when Deila’s side flailed and thrashed around.

Celtic made only one change from the away leg, which finished 1-1, Efe Ambrose – in an eyebrow-raising move – replacing Jason Denayer in defence.

Yet they played at times as if they had been introduced 20 minutes before kick-off. A degree of credit for that should go to Maribor.

Passive at home, they were aggressive here, pressing higher up the field and more menacing in attack.

For Celtic, it started promisingly enough. After five minutes Jo Inge Berget danced to the byeline and squeezed the ball across goal, defender Marko Suler slotting past his own post as Anthony Stokes lurked with intent.

A large crowd, close to capacity, settled in anticipation of a home victory. Yet the passing of time brought unrest and concern rather than an opening goal.

Maribor came close twice in the 16th minute. Agim Ibraimi found too much space in the middle of the pitch and smashed a 25-yard shot inches past Craig Gordon’s post.

Within moments, Stefan Johansen lost the ball in his own half, Tavares almost creating a clear chance until Ambrose got across to snuff out the danger. At right-back, there seemed less prospect of Ambrose — an erratic defender at the best of times — doing any real damage. And yet Maribor came closest of all in 33 minutes.

A diagonal ball to Mitja Viler found Ambrose hopelessly out of position. As he charged across, the attacker cut inside to his right foot with ease and drove a low shot which Gordon brilliantly saved, the ball rebounding off the chest of Tavares and safely into the Scotland keeper’s hands.

For Celtic, it was a let-off. Alarmingly, they were creating little or nothing at the other end.

Callum McGregor was the liveliest player. Yet it was hardly a crowded field. Stokes was hopelessly isolated in attack and looks increasingly uncomfortable with the role Deila is asking him to play.

Even so, the Irishman did craft a decent opening from a driven corner, van Dijk failing to find power or direction with his header.

The concern of the home support was growing by half-time. Deila had repeatedly said he would rather his team lost than play bad football. There was a real danger here that they would exit the Champions League doing both.

For that reason, perhaps, the Norwegian brought Kris Commons into the fray at half-time, withdrawing an ineffectual Kayal.

Left out of the starting line-ups home and away, last season’s top scorer was a surprising omission. And yet this much was clearer. Stokes — and Celtic — needed help. And Deila was seeking it from a player he seems less than enamoured with.

The first thing Commons contributed was a yellow card. The second was a degree of urgency. With the crowd finally finding their voice, the home team gave them something to stir the senses when McGregor struck the bar from 10 yards after a fine run from Stokes.

Celtic, suddenly, had a spring in their play. But few realised then that would be their best opening.

With an away goal from the first game, they had no need to win. In that idealistic way of his, however, Deila was of no mind to take chances. It’s hardly hindsight to say his team were almost too open, frantic even.

Commons came within inches of a spectacular opening goal in 65 minutes, collecting the ball 30 yards from goal. As it sat up, he had just one thought in mind, thumping a half volley inches over the bar. It was a fine effort. And yet, within seconds, Celtic survived a major let-off.

For the first time in the game, Maribor slipped in behind the green and white defence, Dare Vrsic ignoring options inside to thump an angled shot straight at Gordon from 10 yards. The keeper pulled off a fine save, but for Celtic it was a significant escape. Their last of the night.

Adam Matthews replaced Berget. Lustig then limped off to make way for Derk Boerrigter. When the Dutchman is the answer, it’s clear something, somewhere is malfunctioning.

It all told in the end. With the scrambled, looping goal from Tavares. With the last ditch misery for van Dijk. With the disbelieving celebrations of the visitors. For Celtic, the Europa League is now their fate. 

Truth be told, it’s their level.
