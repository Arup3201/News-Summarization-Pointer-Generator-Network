Discovery: Detectives searching for absconded paedophile Robert Edward Hind have found what they believe to be his remains in a river

Detectives searching for a missing paedophile who vanished after he was recalled to prison have found what they believe to be his remains.

Police had been hunting sex attacker 
Robert Hind since last Wednesday when he was ordered back to prison 
after breaching the terms of his licence.

However, today officers searching for the 46-year-old recovered suspected human remains in the area of the river Colne in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.

An underwater search team, dog teams and specialised search officers are currently investigating the scene.

Another 46-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and was being questioned by police.

Superintendent Scott Wood said: 'The remains recovered from the river and its banks will now be forensically examined and enquiries are currently ongoing to identify them.

'Neighbourhood Policing Teams are conducting high visibility patrols in each of these areas responding to any concerns locally.

'I am continuing to appeal for anyone with information in relation to this enquiry to come forward as a matter of urgency.'

Hind used to live in the picturesque town of Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire., before he was jailed in 2011 for abusing a teenage boy.

After he was jailed, neighbours said the front of his former home was daubed with the word 'paedo'.

Dangerous: Hind, left, was described by police as a dangerous and prolific sex offender who police believed posed a serious risk to children

Hind was jailed for three years in September 2011 after he admitted engaging in sexual activity with a teenage boy, who 
cannot be named for legal reasons.

Bradford
Crown Court heard that Hind, who had been jailed twice before for 
indecently assaulting boys, committed the offences at the home of 
another child abuser - who was sentenced to six years in prison in 2010.

Hind was charged after the other abuser, who was locked up for his part in the boyâ€™s ordeal, made a statement to the police.

Investigation: Police are continuing to appeal for information in relation to Hind's disappearance

He was initially jailed indefinitely for public protection but in October 2011 this was changed to a three year sentence.

Police earlier released CCTV images of the last confirmed sighting of 46-year-old Hind, also known as Dack, at Huddersfield bus station, when he was seen with another man at around 9.20am last Wednesday.

The man seen with Hind was described as white, around 5ft 5ins tall wearing black trainers, jeans, a black jacket with a white hooded jumber underneath and was carrying a blue rucksack. He was also wearing a cream coloured beanie style hat.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
