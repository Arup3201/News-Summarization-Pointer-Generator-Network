The 35-year-old woman who slept openly with her brother in the filthy bush camp where 30 members of an incest clan were discovered two years ago has been blocked by police from having any contact with two of her young children.

Disturbing new details have emerged about the incest cult in which Martha Colt slept with brother Charlie in a 'marital' bed inside a tent on the squalid farm, where open buckets of faeces and urine lay about and where their children - brothers and sisters - had sex with each other.

Police successfully took out a two year Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) in Parramatta Local Court on Monday against Ms Colt having any contact with the youngest of her five children, Ruth, 10, and Nadia, 8.

Three of the four mothers from whom police and welfare authorities have taken a total of twelve children into care. Seven of the children were fathered by the women's brother, their father or their nephew

Genetic nightmare: Martha Col's family can be sen on the left of the diagram, which shows that four of her children, Albert, Jed, Nadia and Ruth were fathered by a close relative, and Karl by a near relative. It can now be revealed that Charlie, Martha's brother, is the father of her children

Magistrate Margaret McGlynn told the court that although it was important for the Colt children to continue with the court-appointed pseudonyms, 'it is important the public be made aware of situations of this kind in which these children unfortunately found themselves ... children whose birth parents being siblings and many of their relatives being of incestuous relationships of some kind'.

Ms McGlynn also cited the allegations of sexual activity between the children.

Details included Nadia, who was just six years old when the family commune was uncovered, having sex with her brothers, having sticks inserted into her by her maternal uncle Charlie - who is actually her father - and both her father and mother taking photographs of her vagina.

Martha has five children - the two girls, Nadia and Ruth, and three boys, Karl, 13, Jed, 15 and Albert, 16.

Betty Colt, 48, and her eldest of her 13 children, Raylene, 31, who also had a child removed from her care during the police raid on the squalid bush block where 28 adults lived communally among open buckets of faeces and urine

It was on this bush block (pictured) outside a quiet country town where the Colt family lived in squalor and children were allowed to run rampant and sexually abuse each other 

Following a police raid of the farm, during which officers and welfare workers were horrified at the filthy conditions and the state of the children, all five were removed from Martha Colt's care.

They were unable to speak intelligibly, did not understand basic hygiene, had gone to school for the very first time just two weeks earlier and were engaged in sexual activity with each other.

Ruth, then aged nine years old, was 'drastically underweight', 'was unable to bathe herself, did not know how to use a toilet or what toilet paper was'.

Ruth required urgent dental attention, 'her speech was fragmented and stunted, her features were dysmorphic, she could not read or write'.

Nadia, then aged just six years old, was 'neglected and malnourished, unable to bathe' her hygiene skills were 'primitive'.

She 'didn't know how to use a toilet, what toilet paper was, had not seen a toothbrush before. Her teeth were decayed. She had speech delay ... was delayed educationally'.

Of the 12 Colt children from the whole Colt clan who were later proven by genetic testing to have 'homozygosity', or identical gene patterns in both parents, seven were found to have closely related parents.

Four of those seven children were Martha's.

After the twelve children were removed from the farm and taken into care, the remaining members of the Colt family fled.

Interviewed by caseworkers, Martha's children told horrific tales of sexual abuse by brothers, uncles and fathers.

Nadia told her foster carers that her mother and father took photos of her vagina, that her brothers had licked her vagina and that her maternal uncle Charlie inserted sticks into her.

She said her mother Martha slept with Charlie in a bed each night, and that her father's name was Charlie. She said she had watched her mother having sex with Charlie in the tent.

The family lived in two dirty caravans and tents inside the large shed, which was the domain of Martha, Charlie and their children.

In a clearing on the property were tents, including one called 'the black tent' where most of the sexual offences occurred.

Ruth told caseworkers that Albert, then 15 years old, had put his penis 'in her bottom' and that it 'makes her hurt'.

Nadia told police child care officers that her brothers had touched her private parts with theirs.

Bother Nadia and Ruth disclosed that while their brother lined up to take turns 'hurting their bottoms' their parents Martha and Charlie had been' watching and laughing'.

The living area of the farm 'smelt of urine and faces' and was also populated by about 20 dogs. 

Since the two young girls were taken into care, they have gained weight, improved in their speech and hygiene and are 'attending the local primary school which they love'.

According to court documents, when Martha visited the two girls she was heard to tell them not to speak to 'outsiders' and 'if thy were asked about their family to say "it's none of your business".'

Magistrate McGlynn said it was necessary Nadia and Ruth Colt's identities be protected as they made friends at school and remained free from being judged.

'They not only have the obvious emotional scars, but physical ones as well ... being in new schools, having to make friends and to meet the approval of parents of those children.'
