A 7-year-old boy attending a New Orleans elementary school has accused a male substitute gym teacher of raping him inside a restroom on campus.

Police say they received a call early Monday morning from the child’s mother reporting the assault, which allegedly took place at Mahalia Jackson Elementary School.

So far, no arrests have been made in what investigators have classified as an aggravated rape.

Disturbing claims: A 7-year-old boy attending Mahalia Jackson Elementary School in New Orleans has accused a male substitute gym teacher of raping him inside a restroom on campus

School Principal Lakeysha London told the station WVUE the teacher in question had worked at Mahalia Jackson for three weeks, but was hired by the Orleans Parish public school system back in October.

The unnamed physical education teacher was removed from class after the allegations against him came to light Tuesday.

Interim Schools Superintendent Stan Smith indicated that the accused educator had passed a background check at the time of his hiring without raising any red flags.

The school has made counsellors available for students and staff, and Principal London sent a message to parents alerting them to the ongoing investigation.

'Please be assured that the safety of our students is top priority and the instructional program is proceeding as normal,' she wrote, according to the station WGNO.

The teacher in question has been removed from class, but has yet to be arrested. School officials say he had worked at Mahalia Elementary for three weeks
