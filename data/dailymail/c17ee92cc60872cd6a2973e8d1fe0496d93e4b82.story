Jack Wilshere rolled back the years on Thursday by sharing a picture of himself lining up for Arsenal as a child.

Wilshere joined the club as a nine-year-old and the England international took to Instagram to share a photo of himself with fellow Arsenal academy graduate Benik Afobe.

The pair are pictured in the 2003-04 yellow away shirt, meaning the photo would have been taken more than 10 years ago.

The 22-year-old posted the image with the caption '#TBT (Throwback Thursday) to back in the day with my best friend @bennyjogo #ArsenalBoys #CaptainJack #BabyFace'.

Wilshere has gone on to make more than 150 senior appearances for his boyhood club as well as playing 24 times for his country.

Afobe, meanwhile, has never featured for Arsenal's first team and is currently on loan at League One MK Dons, where he has netted 15 times this season.
