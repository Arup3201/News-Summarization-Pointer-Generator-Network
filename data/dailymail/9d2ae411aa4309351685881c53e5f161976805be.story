Real Sociedad president Jokin Aperribay has revealed the La Liga outfit announced David Moyes' arrival at the club prior to the Scotsman officially signing a deal as they knew he was going to accept an offer.

Aperribay believes Moyes is the right man for the job as he is 'hungry' to impress after a nightmare spell at Manchester United. 

Moyes took a week to decide whether to accept Real Sociedad's offer as he was worried failure in Spain could further tarnish his career.

Aperribay told Spanish radio Onda Cero: 'We had the feeling that Moyes was going to accept our offer. We had to respect his timing, he is very meticulous.

'I see Moyes as being very hungry, I rate him highly and I am very sure that he will achieve our objective. The feeling he gives me is very enriching and positive.'

It is also understood that former Derby and Southampton midfielder Inigo Idiakez is in line to assist Moyes in his new job.

Idiakez played for La Real for 10 years between 1992 and 2002 but is now working at the Leicester City academy. 

It is felt that Idiakez could be a useful conduit for Moyes in case the language barrier emerges as an issue in his early days at the club.
