Forced out: Lotto rapist Iorworth Hoare has put his mansion up for sale at a bargain price after death threats forced him to move

Lotto 
rapist Iorworth Hoare has put his mansion up for sale at a knockdown price after death threats forced him to move out.

Hoare, 59, became notorious when he won £7.2m on the lottery in 2004 after buying a ticket on day 
release from prison while serving a sentence for rape.

Three
 months ago he was forced to leave the exclusive Darras Hall estate in 
Newcastle after the words 'Leave or Die' were spray-painted on the gates
 of his home.

Hoare bought the six-bedroom detached house for £700,000 following his release from a life sentence in 2005.

According to the Daily Mirror, it is now up for sale at the bargain price of £595,000.

After leaving Darras Hall, Hoare rented a luxury flat 
on the city's expensive Quayside - much to the horror of residents.

However,
 he has not been seen there for weeks.

His new flat on the Quayside sold for more than £130,000 back in December 2007 and can bring in around £750 in rent per month.

One neighbour, who asked not to be named and lives in the block with his partner and child, previously said: ‘I have seen him walking in and out of the premises quite a few times.

‘I
 understand that someone has the right to start a new life but the fact 
that it's in a property which has so many corridors and public areas is 
just wrong.

‘People are petrified. We don't want him living here.’

Since his release from prison, Hoare, 
originally from Seacroft, Leeds, has faced a catalogue of abuse and 
threats, most notably in 2006 when he received silver bullets through 
the post.

One letter was addressed to him ordering him to leave the estate or face ‘hired hands who use real ammunition’.

A
 second letter was sent to his neighbour Claire Redhead warning that 
Hoare had been told ‘he must be out by the end of the month or he will 
be hurt’.

Market
 trader Peter Oates, of Brixton, London, was found guilty of threatening
 to kill the jackpot winner and was jailed indefinitely at Newcastle 
Crown Court.

In 2008, Hoare tried to get access to his fortune so he could leave the country and set up home in France.

However he was restricted to £8,666 a month as part of the conditions of his release. 

Hoare was believed to be furious that he could not get his hands on the money.

According to the Daily Mirror he told friends he wanted to set up home in France because he hates 'looking over his shoulder all the time' while in the UK.

It is believed the rest of his fortune can only be accessed with the consent of the Home Office.
