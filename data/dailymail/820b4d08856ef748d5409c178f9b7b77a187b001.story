Lena Dunham has finally responded to claims she made up a story about being raped by an acquaintance in college, detailed in a passage from her new book Not That Kind of Girl, and she's sticking by her story. 

The star and creator of HBO's Girls, wrote an essay on Buzzfeed to address reports claiming to have identified a man named 'Barry' who matched the descriptions of the man who raped her after a party when she was attending Oberlin College nearly a decade ago.

The man interviewed by Breitbart and the National Review denied the claims, saying he never even met Dunham during their time at the Ohio liberal arts college.

Dunham has now clarified that 'Barry' was just a pseudonym she designed to protect the identity of her attacker, who she never meant to identify in the story.  Instead, she says she wrote the essay to bring comfort to other victims like herself and that she intends to continue raising awareness of the issue of sexual assault on college campuses.

Not his name: Lena Dunham says she changed the name of a man who allegedly raped her, when she described the incident in an essay in her new book Not That Kind of Girl 

In Not That Kind of Girl, Dunham describes the night she was walked home by the acquaintance  - a mustachioed Republican who hosted his own campus radio show.

While Dunham admits her memory of the night is hazy, having been drunk and high on cocaine and Xanax, she remains steadfast that she did not consent to having sex with Barry, who was aggressive and twice tried to pull off a condom during the assault.

However, she says it took her a long time to process the attack as a rape, and reach a point in her life where she was comfortable enough to write about it and share it in her book.

Following the book's release, some publications, including conservative websites Breitbart and Nation Review, sought to identify the Oberlin alumnus who raped the writer, using details from the book to narrow down the list of possible attackers. 

Both Brietbart and National Review were led by their research to a man named Barry, who was a prominent campus Republican when Dunham attended the institution. They looked for men named Barry, since Dunham did not explicitly state that the attacker's name was changed, as she did for other stories in the book.

The man Breitbart identified as 'Barry One' (to protect his real name) vehemently denied ever meeting Dunham, and says his reputation has now been tarnished because of the book.

He told the National Review that the experience of being connected to the attack was the 'most unfortunate coincidence of my life'.

But in the Buzzfeed article published Tuesday, Dunham confirmed that 'Barry' was not the name of her attacker, and that she's sorry someone else has been falsely tied to the crime.

'To be very clear, “Barry” is a pseudonym, not the name of the man who assaulted me, and any resemblance to a person with this name is an unfortunate and surreal coincidence. I am sorry about all he has experienced.'

Dunham went on to explain her reason for writing about the rape, saying she never meant for her rapist to be identified and she does not plan to press charges. 

 'Speaking out was never about exposing the man who assaulted me. Rather, it was about exposing my shame, letting it dry out in the sun. 

'I did not wish to be contacted by him or to open a criminal investigation. I am in a loving and peaceful place in my life and I am not willing to sacrifice any more of it for this person I do not know, aside from one night I will never forget. That is my choice.'

While Dunham says she expected the story might cause controversy, she did not think it would lead to assassinations on her credibility. 

Dunham wrote Tuesday's response essay to stop the questions, which she believes have been 'used to cast doubt on other women who have been sexually assaulted'. 

Dunham finishes the essay by saying she will continue to fight for change on college campuses, where rising rates of sexual assault have become a national concern.

'Prevention and response on campuses is only a small part of the problem with how we as a nation are handling sexual assault. But it’s a good place to start. Educational spaces must be made safe, so that we leave them stronger and poised to enact change,' Dunham writes. 

Aaron Minc, the attorney for the man named Barry, said he had received a statement from Random House promising to make clear that Barry is not a real name in any form - although the publisher has not made any public statement itself.

'The statement ignores the fact they let my client hang out there for two months, he’s been damaged,' Mr Minc said.

'We are gratified that they put it out there my client isn’t that guy, but we're not completely satisfied,

'We haven't heard from Lena herself, just the publisher and we want to hear from her at some point exonerating "Barry".

'Lena Dunham is the only person with first-hand knowledge who can truly clear my client’s name.'

Mr Minc - who confirmed to MailOnline Barry had never actually met Ms Dunham - added: 'My client reached out to Ms Dunham's literary agent as early as October 6. He had three reporters contact him within a 48 hour period and he noticed his LinkedIn views skyrocketed into the hundreds.

'He was called at work and at home. He was told by Ms Dunham's agent 'let's not fan the flames', but then watched, to his dismay as she issued statements over Twitter fanning the flames in a so-called 'rage spiral', adding more ambiguity as to the identify of this alleged rapist.'

He added: 'Until yesterday, we had really been treated with compete indifference. We are now in discussions with Dunham and Penguin Random House to remedy this situation.

'This book has already sold about 30,000 copies and will sell around a million copies, we need the book to be edited, so the confusion stops.

'I believe the publishers are amenable to doing something like that.'

The publisher acted as soon as it became public that Barry, with the help of his lawyer, had set up a legal fund to defend his reputation and has already raised nearly $24,000. 

Random House has also offered to pay Barry’s legal fees accrued to date in the case.

Today, Mr Minc released a statement saying while he welcomed Random House's offer to pay Barry's legal expenses, he found the publisher to have committed a 'grievous error.'

And he added: 'Our work, however, is not complete. Random House’s offer to foot legal expenses already incurred fails to take into account the fact there are still ongoing legal expense because of their mistakes.

'We will continue to keep the GoFundMe campaign active to raise money for survivors of sexual assaults and for Barry’s ongoing legal expenses until we receive an apology from Ms. Dunham and both Ms. Dunham and Random House have taken all appropriate steps to clear Barry’s name and restore the damage caused to his reputation.'
