The Princeton women's basketball team had some presidential support in the stands as they beat Wisconsin-Green Bay at their first NCAA tournament game on Saturday. 

Barack Obama was on hand to cheer for his niece Leslie Robinson, a freshman forward for the team.

The president was joined by his daughter Malia and brother-in-law Craig Robinson, who is Leslie's father. 

Obama's mother-in-law Marian and other members of the Robinson clan were also in attendance.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a former professional basketball player and a Chicago pal of the president, also attended. 

Although most of Obama's group wore orange 'Tiger Pride' T-shirts to support the Princeton team, the president kept it traditional with a dark brown sweater.

It wasn't just family favoritism that got Obama cheering from the stands in College Park, Maryland. The president had selected Princeton to make it to the final four on his March Madness bracket.

And although his niece didn't play in the game, there was still plenty of excitement to witness as the undefeated eighth-seeded Princeton team overcame a tight first half to win 80-70. 

It was the first time the women's team had won an NCAA game in Princeton's history.

Even the president couldn't distract Courtney Banghart, the team's coach, from the important tournament game. 

Banghart said she frequently saw Obama during the game because he was sitting right in front of her family. 

'I'd be like, "Oh my God. It's Barack". But it certainly wasn't my focus,' she said. 

But Banghart said having the president in the stands will certainly 'go down as a highlight.'  

Even the opposing team's coach had to get it on the Obama action.

'The president came. I'm going to let my guard down for a minute and be excited about that,' said Green Bay coach Kevin Borseth. 

'I shook his hand. And I got a picture.'   

A brief chant of 'Four more years!' rose from some spectators during the game's second half, drawing a chuckle from Obama.

Security was increased due to the president's presence, with metal detectors and bomb-sniffing dogs present at the stadium's entrance.
