A teenager had to be rescued after a surging riptide dragged her out to sea at a popular tourist beach off the Cornish coast.

Nicole Lonsdale, of Uxbridge, London, was on a summer break with her family in Cornwall when she was dragged towards rocks by a strong underwater current at Porth Beach, near Newquay.

Her family watched in horror as Nicole, 15, was dragged, screaming for help, towards rocks by the treacherous riptide as she swam yards from the beach.

Warning: Holidaymakers have been told to observe red flags at Porth Beach near Newquay, Cornwall

Her father Paul, 44, swam out in an attempt to rescue her but was not able to hold on to her and she was swept across the mouth of Porth Bay.

The teenager finally managed to clamber on to a rock ledge, while Paul was stranded on rocks 200 yards away on the opposite side of the bay.

Holidaymakers who saw the unfolding drama from the beach alerted the coastguard, who launched Newquay's inshore lifeboats and scrambled the air-sea rescue helicopter.

One of the lifeboats inched close to the rocks and lifted Paul to safety, but the waves and riptide were so strong that it couldn't reach his daughter clinging to the rocks the other side of the bay.

The rescuers yelled to her to hang on and after a few minutes she was airlifted to safety in a harness lowered by the helicopter.

The watching crowds on the beach clapped and cheered as she was placed in the helicopter's survivor bay and flown to hospital.

Suffering from the cold and exhausted by her ordeal, and sporting a few cuts and bruises where she'd scrambled on to the jagged rocks, she was otherwise unhurt.

Paul said: ‘I swam out and tried to grab hold of her but I just couldn't manage it.

‘When she was swept back out to sea I thought "this is it, this is the end".

‘I shouted for help - I just didn't know what to do. It's a miracle she managed to get on to the rocks.

‘The lifeboat and the helicopter were just amazing. It's really strange because our family are RNLI fund-raisers.’

The rescue happened at 6.30pm on Monday, just minutes after the beach lifeguards had packed up for the day.

A coastguard spokesman said: ‘Thankfully this ended happily - it could have turned out tragically.

‘The riptides can be treacherous so holidaymakers should take great care and observe the red flag warning areas at all times.’
