It was plauded by movie critics and hailed by activists for its championing of gay rights.

But marketing gurus have been forced to 'straight-wash' 2013 British film Pride - so that it appeals to a wide US audience.

The DVD cover of the movie, based on the campaign of a gay and lesbian activist group, has been altered - with any reference to the film's focal theme of homosexuality removed.

Original version: In UK promotional material a banner reading 'lesbians and gays support the miners' is seen behind the marching crowd

In UK promotional material, a banner visible behind the marching crowd of campaigners appears to read: 'Lesbians and gays support the miners.'

On the US version this banner has been digitally removed, and the synopsis has eradicated any hint of homosexuality - vaguely referring to the film's protagonists as 'London-based activists'.

In Britain, this had been written as 'a London-based group of gay and lesbian activists'.

The designers of the US DVD cover have been accused of putting the film back in the closet, with some critics dubbing the move a 'straight-washing'.

The film, aired in cinemas in September, is based on the true events of the LGBT activists who marched in solidarity with coal miners during their strike in 1984.

The movie, which stars Imelda Staunton and Bill Nighy, was released on DVD in the US shortly before Christmas by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, after the rights to the film were bought by CBS Films.

Ben Roberts, of the British Film Institute, told The Independent: 'I'm not surprised that the US distributors have taken a decision to sell more copies by watering down the gay content. 

'I'm not defending it - it's wrong and outmoded - but I'm not surprised.

'It's an unfortunate commercial reality both here and in the US that distributors have to deal with. LGBT material is largely marginalised outside of rare hits like Brokeback Mountain.'

Gay author Matt Cain also criticised the move, saying it went against the spirit of the film.

But Mr Cain, who is the former culture editor of Channel 4 News, said it will be a positive thing if it means more people buy the DVD and watch it.

Pride was not a huge hit at the box office, but was plauded by critics and has already won a series of awards.

In the US, it is nominated for a Golden Globe in the category of best comedy or musical film - with the ceremony taking place on Sunday.

It was also named best film at the British Independent Film Awards in December.

Accepting the top award of the night, Pride director Matthew Warchus told the BBC: 'We're getting reports from up and down the country of audiences standing up and applauding. 

That doesn't really happen in British cinemas. It's just extraordinary. It's a real tribute to the source material.'
