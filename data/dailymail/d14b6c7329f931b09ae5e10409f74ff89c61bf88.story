The plight of a middle-aged stroke victim who wants a nurse to help him die threw the controversial laws on suicide into fresh turmoil yesterday.

Appeal judges decided that the 48-year-old victim, known only as Martin, should be given new guidelines on whether a nurse who helps him end his life will be prosecuted for assisted suicide.

The decision means that for the second time in four years the Director of Public Prosecutions has been instructed by judges to draw up rules on who will and who will not be charged with helping a suicide, a crime that can bring a jail sentence of 14 years.

Ruling: The case of the 48-year-old, known only as Martin, was one of three right-to-die hearings at the Court of Appeal in central London (pictured)

The Court of Appeal ruling was immediately challenged by the DPP, Keir Starmer.

Mr Starmer, who is to step down as head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the autumn, called for a final ruling from the higher Supreme Court before he produces new guidelines.

And it was also condemned in a ringing dissenting opinion by the most senior of the three judges who heard Martin's case.

Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, the head of the judiciary in England and Wales, broke with his two colleagues and said the DPP should not be given powers to reform the law on his own.

The Martin ruling was one of three cases of desperately disabled individuals who hope to die decided by the Court of Appeal yesterday.

In a second case, 57-year-old road accident victim Paul Lamb was told that no doctor will be allowed to help him take his own life at home.

Lord Judge, sitting with Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson and Lord Justice Elias, also denied the pleas of the family of locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson that human rights law means he should have been entitled to help to die.

'I think it would be sensible for the CPS, if possible, to have the benefit of the views of the Supreme Court before any amendments are made to the DPP's guidelines in this important and sensitive area of the law'

Mr Nicklinson died last summer at the age of 58 before his request came to the Appeal Court.

His death came after he refused to take food and drink shortly after losing a first High Court case last summer, and his wife Jane has been allowed to pursue his claim.

The judges said that it is for Parliament to make the law on assisted suicide.

But in the Martin case two of the 
judges overruled Lord Judge and said he was right to ask for 'clearer 
guidance' from the DPP on whether a nurse or doctor brought in to help 
him will face prosecution.

Martin
suffered a brainstem stroke five years ago which left him almost 
entirely unable to move and without the ability to speak.

He communicates by moving his head and 
eyes, and by staring at a computer which can detect when he looks at a 
letter or number, a process described by the judges as 'painfully slow'.

Lord Dyson and Lord Justice Elias said: 'He finds his life and his condition to be undignified, distressing and intolerable.'

They said Martin had tried to dehydrate and starve himself to death, but 'his attempt failed in the most distressing circumstances.'

His alternative, the judges said, was to travel to the Dignitas suicide clinic in Zurich.

But, they said, Martin's wife, who is a nurse, does not want to help him die and will not help him travel to Switzerland.

He therefore needs to find someone else to help him, and the DPP should give clearer guidance on whether that person will be prosecuted.

Mr Starmer drew up guidelines in 2010 on the instructions of the courts. These say that an assisted suicide prosecution is more likely if a medical professional helps in the death.

The DPP said yesterday: 'While I respect the carefully considered judgment of the Court of Appeal, I think it would be sensible for the CPS, if possible, to have the benefit of the views of the Supreme Court before any amendments are made to the DPP's guidelines in this important and sensitive area of the law.'

Lord Judge said in his dissenting opinion: 'Prosecutorial guidance is in danger of expanding into a method of law reform which is outside the proper ambit of the DPP's responsibilities.'

He said that prosecution guidelines could be applied so that people who should in law be prosecuted escape without criminal charges.
