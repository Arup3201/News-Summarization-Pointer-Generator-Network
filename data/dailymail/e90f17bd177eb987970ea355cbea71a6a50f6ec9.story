A judge ruled on Monday that Casey Kasem should be fed, hydrated and medicated while a court-appointed attorney evaluates the health of the ailing radio personality after his daughter moved to implement end of life measures.

Kasem, who has dementia, is in critical condition in a Washington hospital.

His daughter Kerri Kasem, who has been placed in temporary control of his treatment, consulted with doctors and decided in recent days to stop giving her father food, water and medications, attorneys said in court.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy ruled that Casey Kasem should receive the treatments while an attorney appointed by the judge meets with Kasem and his doctors in Washington state.

Kerri Kasem's attorney Troy Martin said the decision to begin end-of-life measures was made after doctors determined that feeding and hydrating the celebrity had become increasingly painful.

Martin said the judge's ruling is likely to cause the former American Top 40 host more pain.

Casey Kasem's wife of 34 years, Jean Kasem, appeared in court and said she supported Murphy's ruling and will ask to be restored as her husband's caretaker.

‘Only God knows when to take someone,’ she said.

She lashed out at Kerri Kasem and judges who have found Jean Kasem in contempt for refusing to cooperate with her stepdaughter, who was named Casey Kasem's temporary conservator last month after he was moved to Washington state.

Murphy scheduled a hearing for Friday to receive an update about Kasem's health. Jean Kasem's attorney, Steve Haney, said it was unclear how much longer Kasem had to live.

Despite the family acrimony, Murphy said Kerri and Jean Kasem seemed to be doing what was best for Casey Kasem.

‘It appears to the court that all parties have the best interest of Mr. Kasem at heart,’ the judge said.

Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American Top 40 and Casey's Top 40. He also was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon Scooby Doo.
