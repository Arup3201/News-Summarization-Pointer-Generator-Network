The heartbroken husband of actress Lynda Bellingham has told how he can’t bear to spend Christmas without his beloved wife, following her tragic death from cancer.

Michael Pattemore, 59, has struggled to cope with losing his TV star wife, who died from colon cancer aged 66 in October.

The property developer is now planning to travel to Dubai for Christmas, so he doesn’t have to face being at home without her, while her sons Robbie and Michael Peluso plan to do their own thing.

Mr Pattemore, who buried his wife in Crewkerne, Somerset, on November 3 - ten years to the day they met - said he wants to visit Dubai for the festive period because it’s where his wife took him for a surprise birthday trip nine years ago.

He told the Sunday Mirror: ‘Whatever I do, wherever I am, I know I am still going to miss her dreadfully.

‘All she wanted at the end was to make one last family Christmas… but that wasn’t to be.

‘I can’t stay at home and be on my own. I want them [her sons] to lead their own lives but it means I am alone and surrounded by reminders of just how much I’ve lost.’

Mr Pattemore, who was a constant presence by his wife’s side as she undertook her final TV interviews and public appearances to say goodbye to her fans, has been busy raising thousands of pounds for Action Against Cancer since his wife’s death on October 19.

While he is set to travel to Dubai for the festive period, Lynda’s sons are expected to have Christmas dinner with their father, Lynda’s ex-husband Nunzio Peluso.

Michael, 31, is then expected to stay in London for the remainder of the Christmas period, while hotel manager Robbie, 26, is set to visit family friends in Wales.

The trio opted to do their own thing for Christmas this year, after deciding it would be too difficult to spend it together without Lynda.

‘I think we all need a change of scenery this year,’ Michael said.

In a previous interview with Yours magazine, Robbie said: ‘Mum always made Christmas very, very special for us. We’ll all miss her so much.’

And Michael added: ‘You can decorate the house, have a lovely tree and all the presents in the world but without mum it’s all just stuff. She turned stuff into magic.'

Lynda, who was diagnosed with cancer in July last year, had hoped to spend one last Christmas with her family, before stopping chemotherapy in order to pass away in January.

She made the decision in August to end her treatment to limit the amount of suffering her family would witness.

However, the advanced state of her illness meant she was unable to die at home in the new year as she had dearly wished.

Actor Christopher Biggins, who knew Lynda for 35 years and describes her as a ‘dear friend’ and ‘very special person’, said he could understand why her family wanted to get away for Christmas.

He told The Sunday People: ‘Michael isn’t looking forward to Christmas knowing they won’t be celebrating together.

‘It would be painful for him to stay in London and spend the festive season without Lynda.

‘Lynda was a massive fan of Christmas. I think Lynda’s two sons will do their own things – they have their own friends and family. But Michael feels that he needs to be away from all the painful memories and he deserves that.’

In her last few weeks, before she died in the arms of her husband, Lynda spoke openly about her illness and its effect on her family.

The actress, whose sister Barbara died from lung cancer, had been a high-profile supporter of Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Support.

Her acting career included the title role in sitcom Faith In The Future and regular stage roles.

The mother-of-two also appeared as the mother in a squabbling family in the Oxo adverts in the 1980s, and was awarded an OBE in the New Year Honours list for her charity work.

The advert is set to make a return to TV screens this Christmas, after more than 150,000 fans joined a campaign to bring back the classic stock cube advert - to pay tribute to Lynda’s wish for one last Christmas.

The actress was also a regular on panel show Loose Women, and filmed a special farewell episode where she spoke about her illness.

More than two million viewers tuned in to the show last month to watch her final interview in a special farewell edition, recorded just days before her death.

She was given a standing ovation as she entered the studio and told her co-stars how she wished to be remembered.

Prior to her death, she also released an autobiography, There's Something I've Been Dying to Tell You, in which she openly discussed her illness. It sold thousands of copies in the days after her death and has since topped several best-sellers list.

Figures from her publisher show the book sold 35,084 copies in the week after her death, more than double the next highest selling non-fiction hardback.
