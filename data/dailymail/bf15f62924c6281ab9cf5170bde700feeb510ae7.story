Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has revealed she’s ‘living the dream’ as she tops a list of this year’s Most Intriguing People.

The 58-year-old’s popularity has soared in 2014, partly thanks to her handling of overseas incidences such as the MH17 disaster where she helped ensure authorities could gain access to the crash site in Eastern Ukraine to retrieve the bodies of those killed.

‘I see myself as Australia’s relationship manager,’ she told WHO magazine as they heralded her Australia’s Most Intriguing Person in their Best and Worst 2014 issue on sale today.

She beat the likes of 27-year-old model and A-list girlfriend Lara Bingle and former Miss Universe Australia Jesinta Campbell to the top spot.

WHO noted how Jesinta stood by her AFL star boyfriend Buddy Franklin after his car crash in April and how Lara has documented her luxury holidays around the world with actor boyfriend Sam Worthington.

The Liberal party's first female Deputy Leader also called for ‘more women in Cabinet’, explaining that she thinks ‘women make a great contribution to discussions; they offer a different perspective.’

The fierce politician gave the public a glimpse into her personality this year, revealing what she gets up to in her (limited) spare time.

The 58-year-old politician is a fan of ‘investment pieces’ such as Armani suits

A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document gave the public information on her non-stop professional life and personal preferences when travelling. Her tight schedule includes getting only four hours sleep a night - but she still manages to fit in a workout each day.

The document makes note of her love of running, saying under 'Personal Time' that she requests '1 hour (early morning) for exercise.' Her morning jogs have become known among other foreign staff, who often join her in her precious sole hour of 'alone time' in her hectic day.

The minister is also not a coffee drinker, despite only sleeping for four hours a night, noting that 'We don't have time for that'.

She prefers 'English Breakfast tea with skim milk or peppermint tea', but isn't demanding, noting that there is 'no need to provide in hotel room.'

Ms Bishop 'Prefers sparkling water, however will drink wine or Champagne at appropriate functions,' the document states.

In her WHO interview she also confirms her love of Champagne at social occasions.

Earlier this month, the Foreign Minister gave the public a glimpse inside her designer wardrobe, telling News Corp that she is a fan of ‘investment pieces’ such as Armani suits coupled with Louis Vuitton and Christian Louboutin heels.

‘Give a girl the right shoes and she can take on the world,’ she said on her passion for red stilettos.

She applies Chanel cosmetics to her face and during her treasured half-hour 6km daily run she dons 2XU and Asics sports gear.

Despite her penchant for designer garb, she claims she does not spend more than half an hour putting herself together before stepping out as Foreign Minister.

‘I can do make-up and hair in a very short space of time. You have to because you’re constantly on the move, constantly on the run,’ she explained.

Ms Bishop accessories with brooches, in a look inspired by US politician Hilary Clinton, and believes it’s her duty to wear clothes ‘that will promote an appropriate image for Australia’.

It’s not all about big international fashion house names though – Ms Bishop also wears pieces from Perth designer Isabel Aujoulet.

Ms Bishop gushed that her dream wardrobe would be ‘Carrie’s out of Sex and the City. The one where she buys an apartment with Big, you know the one, in the movie?’.

And proving she can be ‘down with the kids’ she recently spoke only in emojis to her followers on Twitter, even wishing her staff at DFAT a merry Christmas and good summer break with cute Santa face and Christmas tree emojis.

Julie Bishop thanked her staff with this emoji-filled tweet
