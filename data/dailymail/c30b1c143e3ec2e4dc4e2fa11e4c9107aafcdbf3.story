Wladimir Klitschko will make a belated return to the American ring when he takes on Bryant Jennings at Madison Square Garden on April 25.

The long-reigning heavyweight champion, who holds three of the four major belts, has not fought in the United States since his win over Sultan Ibragimov at the same venue in 2008.

Since then Klitschko has fought primarily in Germany, making 13 successful defences of his titles.

The Ukrainian will be making the 18th straight defence of his second reign as world champion and is the second-longest reigning heavyweight in history, just under three years shy of matching Larry Holmes’ record of 11 years and eight months.

He said: 'I do have great respect for Bryant Jennings and his achievements. He has good movement in the ring and good technique. I know this will be a tough challenge.

'I am extremely happy to fight in New York again. I had my first unification fight here and a lot of great heavyweight matches have taken place at Madison Square Garden.

'It will definitely be a great fight night and I will do everything for it from my side.'

The undefeated Jennings who, at 30, is eight years his opponent’s junior, did not start boxing until 2009 and fought just 17 times as an amateur.

He made his professional debut a year later and has won all 19 of his fights with 10 coming by knockout.

His most impressive victory was his latest, a split-decision win over Cuban Mike Perez last July.

Of his upcoming fight with Jennings, Klitschko said: 'I am extremely happy to fight in New York again'

‘I have all of the attributes naturally to be a champion that you can’t teach - heart and will,’ Jennings told ESPN. ‘I’m psyched up. This is the level where I’m at. This is exactly what I planned to do.

‘Whatever competition you are in, your goal should be to reach the top. This is the top, but now it’s about taking it to higher heights and winning.’

Should Klitschko prevail, he will surely target America’s newest champion, Deontay Wilder, after his impressive victory over Bermane Stiverne last weekend.
