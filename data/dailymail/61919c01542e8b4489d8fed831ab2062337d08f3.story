Aside from winning fashion designer of the year and making millions with the Spice Girls, appearing on the cover of UK Vogue for the third time has to be one of Victoria Beckham's greatest career coups.

Always known for her immaculately glossy appearance, you'd think the fashion designer would pull out all the stops to ensure she looked picture perfect for her starring role.

However, the 40-year-old, who never has so much as a hair out of place, shocked the world when she appeared on the fashion bible wearing a baggy jumper, Wellington boots, and a messy up-do.

Could YOU look this good in just one minute? Victoria Beckham's beauty team have revealed that it only took a minute to style the designer's hair into its laidback luxe style for her Vogue cover

Stylist Tina Outen, who worked her magic on Victoria's hair for the cover and describes her as 'awesome fun', said the style was a spontaneous decision.

'It probably took less than a minute, it
 was just a matter of putting it up, pinning it and playing around with 
it to make it look right for her face.

'Victoria knows her face very well
 so she knows what suits her, but she's very respectful and trusting. 
She lets you do your job,' she told Vogue.co.uk.

'The hair for the other cover was 
literally created by her getting dressed, getting her hair caught in the
 coat and us pulling pieces out and giving it a bit of a finish. That's 
how we approached the hair for all of the shots - we just got the 
texture right, all looked at it in the mirror and then we just let it 
evolve,' she added.

Tina explained that Victoria likes to be able to touch her hair and to play with it, hence the laidback luxe look she embraces on the cover, which we will all be copying next season.

Opening up about the shoot in a behind the scenes video, Victoria said: ‘I’m never afraid to try something different when I’m working with the best people.’

The 
mother-of-four continued: ‘Doing a Vogue shoot is always very exciting –
 it’s Vogue and the team, the creative team, the photographer, the hair,
 the make-up, the styling, everything is the best.’

The video also features Vogue’s fashion director Lucinda Chalmers who reveals her thought process behind the shoot.

Speaking as they shot in Surrey on a rainy day, she said: ‘We want to try do something we haven’t really seen her do before.

As we're used to seeing her: The Vogue team said they wanted to try something different on the usually polished Victoria, who was perfectly happy to adhere

‘She has a very particular look, very 
cool, very paired down and what I really wanted to do with her was 
really rough her up a bit.’

In between shooting the designer, who is married to David Beckham, revealed a little about her fashion memories.

‘I always loved clothes as a child. I used to really enjoy watching my mother get dressed up,’ she shared.

‘My earliest childhood memory is sitting
 on her bed watching her and her attention to detail, putting her 
make-up on and doing her hair, she always looked fabulous.’

Quite the difference! Victoria Beckham's first Vogue cover in February 2011 is a far cry from the country chic lady on the August cover

Picking up some tips? Following her Vogue shoot, Victoria was seen at Wimbledon sporting a more messy hairstyle

And talking about how she uses clothes 
these days she said: ‘I use clothes to express how I’m feeling myself 
and when designing clothes I like to empower women, I want to make them 
feel strong and beautiful and confident.’

As the video comes to an end the British
 star concludes: ‘What’s next for me? I have my next store opening 
hopefully in September in Dover Street in London and I’m opening an 
office in New York so I’ve been very, very busy at work, juggling the 
work and the kids and David but it’s all good, I feel very blessed, very
 lucky and I am having fun.’
