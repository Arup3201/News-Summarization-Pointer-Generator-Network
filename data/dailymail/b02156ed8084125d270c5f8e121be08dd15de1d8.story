French car hire firms have poked fun at President Francois Hollande by suggesting he should have used a car with tinted windows for his 'tryst'.

Hollande has had a rough two weeks both personally and politically since glossy magazine Closer published allegations that he has having an affair with with actress Julie Gayet, 41.

It revealed pictures of him hopping off the back of a motor scooter, his head clad in a large black helmet, for an apparent rendezvous at an apartment near the presidential palace.

While most French voters say the president's love life is his own business, news of the affair has trended on social networks, prompting businesses to seek to tap in on the issue in their ads.

A car-hire company, Drive, ran a newspaper ad with a map tracing the route from the Elysee presidential palace to the apartment where Hollande's tryst ocurred - and pricing the trip at five euros.

'Unseen. Unknown. Private cars, tinted windows. At prices this low, you should choose discretion,' it said.

Another rental car company, Sixt, made a similar crack in a newspaper insert telling Hollande: 'Mr President, next time avoid the scooter. Sixt rents cars with tinted windows.'

The company, which is headquartered in Germany, is known for picking on French presidents. It also had a go at Hollande's diminutive predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, after he divorced his wife and married actress, singer and fashion model Carla Bruni.

'Do like Mrs Bruni and opt for a small French model,' it told customers in a German ad.

Online dating site Be2 tapped into sympathy for Hollande's partner Valerie Trierweiler, mocking a line from the president's 2012 election campaign against Sarkozy.

'Dear Valerie, the time to change is now,' it said on its homepage.

Virgin Radio for its part compared the president's motorbike helmet to those worn by French electronic music duo Daft Punk.

'Mr President, we know you're a fan. Daft Punk is on the Virgin Radio playlist,' it said.

Since reports of the affair surfaced, Mr Hollande's popularity seems to have been boosted, albeit by a slender margin, France 24 reported today.

The latest survey, by the French BVA polling institute, gave him 31 per cent approval, up from 26 per cent in October, the lowest popularity rating for a French president in modern times.

The BVA poll was conducted on January 16 and 17 â€“ a full week after the story broke in a French gossip magazine that Hollande was seeing 41-year-old actress Julie Gayet.

It also followed a January 14 press conference in which the French leader resolutely steered away from commenting on his alleged liaison with Gayet, preferring instead to focus on Franceâ€™s struggling economy.
