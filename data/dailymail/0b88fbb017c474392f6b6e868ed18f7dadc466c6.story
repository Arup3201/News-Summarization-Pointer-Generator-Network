Ed Miliband delayed the start of the Iraq war inquiry by voting ‘again and again and again’ against it being set up, David Cameron said yesterday.

The Prime Minister said the report’s conclusions would have been published ‘years ago’ had it not been for Labour MPs blocking the plans.

Mr Miliband personally voted against an inquiry on four occasions. The issue erupted in the House of Commons after it emerged that Sir John Chilcot will not report until after the election.

Despite the row dominating news bulletins all day, Mr Miliband skated over the issue at Prime Minister’s Questions – dismissing it in two sentences.

The Labour leader did not even ask Mr Cameron about the issue, saying only that he agreed the report should be ‘published as soon as possible’.

Labour MPs opposed a series of proposals for an inquiry in the Commons until one was ordered by Gordon Brown.

Mr Miliband personally voted against starting an inquiry on four occasions as an MP, first in October 2006, then in June 2007, once more in March 2008 and again in March 2009.

Several former senior Labour figures, including Mr Miliband’s brother David, will come under scrutiny when the report is finally published.

At the start of Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Miliband said: ‘Let me start by saying, on the Iraq inquiry, that it was set up six years ago and I agree with the Prime Minister that it should be published as soon as possible.’

He then moved swiftly on to the economy. The PM countered, saying the report would have been published ‘years ago’ had Labour MPs voted in favour of setting up the inquiry earlier.

‘So perhaps he could start by recognising his own regret at voting against the establishment of the inquiry,’ he said.

Mr Miliband replied: ‘The inquiry was established six years ago, after our combat operations had ended, and frankly, my views on the Iraq war are well known and I want this inquiry to be published.’

Unlike his brother, Ed Miliband was not an MP in 2003 in the run-up to the war. At the time he was at Harvard University in the US.

During his campaign for the Labour leadership he said the invasion was a ‘profound mistake’ and claimed to have opposed it in private.

But according to reports, his brother dismissed this claim, saying that the only candidate for the leadership who could say they were against the war at the time was Diane Abbott.
