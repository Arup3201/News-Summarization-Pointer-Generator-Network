A dentist who pulled out a man's teeth to try and cure his erectile dysfunction has been ordered to pay 20,000 euros (£14,000) in compensation.

The patient - known only as Alex S - had all 19 of his teeth removed over four weeks in Munich, Germany, and was charged 2,000 euros (£1,435).

He believed the series of operations would help him regain his vitality and also cure his schizophrenia.

The dentist - known only as K - claimed to be a 'recognised healer' and said he helped the 'spiritual self-healing capabilities of his patients'. 

It is thought he believed the operation would help cure Mr S, The Local reported. 

In a letter to his lawyer K claimed that he had  healed the patient by removing his 'poisonous' teeth - adding that the patient was 'not psychotic' but 'marvellous'. 

But in court K said he pulled the teeth out because Mr S, who lived in woods and only ate raw foods, had bone inflammation and was allergic to fillings.

The dentist even tried to demand 50,000 euros (£36,000) in compensation for damage done to his professional reputation by the trial.

An independent report found no basis for the operation.

The judge said K should have recognised that Mr S 'didn't quite tick right', adding that he was not a 'normal dentist'. K was also ordered to pay the cost of Mr S's implants.
