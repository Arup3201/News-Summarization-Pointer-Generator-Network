Two brothers today admitted their part in a £1.5million smash-and-grab raid on Selfridges in London by a gang masquerading as burka-wearing women.

Sam Curtin, 24, and Connor Groake, 19, were members of a six-strong group who mingled with shoppers before smashing open display cabinets in the evening attack at the department store.

They snatched 42 luxury watches before attempting to make their escape on a stolen moped, but were arrested after crashing the vehicle and being held by members of the public.

Both pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit a robbery and aggravated vehicle taking - which relates to the moped they used in the raid - at Kingston Crown Court today.

Police believe an estimated £1.5million worth of luxury goods were taken in the raid. In total, around 140 watches were stolen, made by designer brands including Hublot, Jaeger Le Coultre, Dreyfuss, Zenith, U-Boat, Raymond Weil, Blancpain, Frederique Constant, Burberry, Bremont, Baume & Mercier and Audemars Piguet.

Forty-two of the stolen watches were recovered with their tags on in a holdall. However, a further £1million worth of watches are yet to be recovered.

At an earlier hearing, the court heard how Curtin was trying to make his getaway with Groake, his half brother, on the scooter when it crashed on Charlotte Street, in central London's West End shopping district.

After being stopped from running away by members of the public, he was detained by police officers.

He was taken to hospital with a fractured leg and hobbled into court today on crutches, wearing a grey t-shirt and grey jogging bottoms.

The court heard Groake, who was dressed in a blue t-shirt and jogging bottoms today, was riding the Vespa moped at the time of the crash and escaped uninjured, but was also stopped from escaping by passers-by. The rest of the gang remain at large.

At today's hearing, Judge Nicholas Price QC said the incident was a 'matter of grave importance and seriousness'.

Selfridge's robber Sam Curtin's broken leg is not being looked after properly in jail and has begun to smell bad, his lawyer claimed today.

Gordon Johnston, representing Curtin, told the court how his client’s injuries were getting worse because of the lack of treatment he was getting at Wandsworth Prison.

He said: 'The hospital has complained that he is not being treated in the way they expect and have warned that if his leg is not allowed to heal correctly it may have to be broken again.

'The wound smells and it needs attention.'

Judge Price said: 'I am astonished to hear that if the hospital have required him to attend why he hasn’t done so.

'If he needs treatment and needs it urgently it must be done.'

Members of the gang wore burkas - the full body cloak worn by some Muslim women to hide their bodies in public - to disguise themselves and the tools they were carrying as they mingled with customers at Selfridges on June 6, police said.

The axe and sledge hammer-wielding raiders waited for an apparently pre-arranged moment to smash glass cabinets then filled their holdalls with the watches.

They then fled using getaway vehicles including a moped, two motorbikes and a black BMW estate. But moments later Curtin and Groake crashed in Charlotte Street, at junction with Goodge Street.

Police revealed the two motorbikes used in the robbery were later recovered by officers in Bolton Place, near the junction with Taunton Place, in Marylebone.

The suspects were seen to run off in the direction of Russmore Road, where another vehicle may have been waiting.

The black BMW was found in Cumberland Gardens, central London, the following day.

At Curtin’s first appearance at Lavender Hill Magistrates’ Court in south London, Christian Wheeliker, prosecuting, said: 'This defendant was part of the Selfridges watch robbery where approximately £1.5million of watches were stolen by a gang of around 10 males.

'Six of them went into Selfridges wearing Burkas and produced axes and sledgehammers and smashed open the watch cabinets causing great fear to everyone else around, because this was a couple of days after the Woolwich incident and because of the get-up and the particular manner.'

Aftermath: The raiders waited for an apparently pre-arranged moment to smash the glass cabinets, fill their holdalls with the watches then flee in vehicles including a moped, two motorbikes and a black BMW estate

Detectives from the Met’s Flying Squad are still hunting the outstanding suspects and asking anyone who may have any information to come forward.

They are also appealing to anyone who may have been offered one of the watches to get in contact with them.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Noyes, from the Flying Squad, said: 'The robbery took place whilst the store was full with shoppers and we still want to hear from anyone who was in or around Selfridges on Thursday June 6th who witnessed the robbery, or may have seen the men in the time running up to the robbery or as they made their escape.

'This robbery will have taken planning and preparation and there may be people who think they know who was responsible, police need to hear from them.

'Likewise I would urge anyone who took photos or video footage whilst the robbery was in progress or when the six fled the store to send them to us as this could greatly assist us with our investigation.

'It is also important that we hear from anyone who has been approached to buy a luxury watch to also get in contact.'

Curtin and Groake, both from Islington, north London, will be sentenced later this month.
