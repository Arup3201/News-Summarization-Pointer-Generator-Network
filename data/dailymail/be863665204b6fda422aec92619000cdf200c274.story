Premier League chief Richard Scudamore has admitted he is relieved bad boy Luis Suarez has departed English football.

The Uruguay striker left Liverpool for Barcelona earlier this summer in a £75million deal, bringing an end to his eventful three-year spell on these shores.

Suarez established a reputation as one of the Barclays Premier League’s best-ever strikers while at Anfield but several flashpoints overshadowed his performances.

The South American was found guilty of racially abusing then-Manchester United defender Patrice Evra, banned for 10 matches after biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic and was regularly accused of diving.

The ugly side of his game reared its head again during the World Cup when he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini — the third time in his career he has been found guilty of such an offence.

Suarez will find out on Thursday whether his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against his four-month football ban for biting Chiellini’s shoulder is successful. Whatever the outcome, the top-flight’s chief executive is glad to see the back of the striker.

‘I don’t think his departure hurts the Premier League,’ said Scudamore.

‘He is an undeniable, world-class talent, but there comes a point when you just can’t go on defending the indefensible.

‘Therefore the risk of something happening, whether it be this season or next season, is so high that you just say: “Actually, thank you very much. It was great to have you while we had you. But you’re not worth the risk”.

‘He’s great to have but an accident waiting to happen. He’s done his time here, but I can’t say I’m sorry to see him go.

‘We won’t miss him because there is only so long we can go on defending the indefensible.’

Scudamore’s comments came at the official launch of the new Premier League season. It was the first time the 55-year-old has spoken publicly since sexist emails from his account were leaked to a national newspaper and nearly cost him his job earlier this year.

Scudamore has since apologised and insisted the organisation does not have a sexism problem.

‘There is not a sexist culture in the Premier League, I think we can be absolutely sure of that,’ he said.

‘Nearly 50 per cent of our employers are female. Every single one of them — and believe you me people were trying to goad one of them to “dob” on the culture of the Premier League — will say it’s a very invigorating place to work. There’s some very aggrieved female employees who have seen the organisation characterised in the way it was. Of course, it was difficult and I apologised straight away.

‘The clubs were assembled and they gave me their backing unanimously. I can’t say more than that, they were private emails and there is a legal process that is going on so I can’t say more.’

Scudamore also reiterated his intention to introduce a ‘39th Premier League game’.

The notion of playing an extra round of fixtures abroad was first mooted in 2008 but was heavily criticised.

‘I thought it was a good idea (back then), and I still think it’s a good idea now,’ he added.
