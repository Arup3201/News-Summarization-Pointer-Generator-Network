Anti-virus software tycoon John McAfee said Thursday that U.S. authorities have made no efforts to question him since he arrived in Miami after weeks of evading Belizean authorities who want to ask him about the murder of his neighbor.

'Why would they want to question me, about what?' a tired-looking but sharply dressed McAfee told a throng of reporters Thursday from the steps of his South Beach hotel. The multimillionaire was characteristically chatty and seemed to enjoy posing for pictures with tourists and signing autographs.

McAfee was deported from Guatemala after sneaking in illegally from Belize, where police want to question him in connection with the death of a U.S. expatriate who lived near him on an island off Belize's coast.

U.S officials said there was no active arrest warrant for McAfee that would justify taking him into custody.

Once he was on the plane, he said 'I had the warmest welcome of my life. The captain patted me on the shoulders and said, `We're here to help you, sir, please come with us.''

He said he planned to stay in Miami until his girlfriend, 20-year-old Belizean Samantha Vanegas, and a woman he called 'Amy' could join him.

The 67-year-old British native said he has no money and no home in the U.S. and has been getting by on cash that a Canadian friend sent him until his property manager comes to Miami with his cash and credit cards.

If he's reunited with the women, he said he doesn't know where he'll live or how he'll rebuild his life. Over the weekend, he said he would be happy to go to England, noting he has dual citizenship.

McAfee bristled as reporters repeatedly asked him why he won't answer questions from officials in Belize, denying he was under investigation.

He stressed that he was afraid to answer questions because dozens of officials there stormed his property, killed his dogs, handcuffed him for hours and tried to extort money. He has not been charged with a crime.

'If they didn't want to harm me, why have they been harming my property and my dogs? Now five of my dogs have been killed,' said McAfee, claiming authorities shot one of his dogs in the head and raided his house eight times.

He said he had no choice but to flee because 'there was a nationwide manhunt for me' and he worried he would be thrown in a cell and silenced if captured. He claims officials in Belize also trumped up charges against him for running a meth lab out of his home and hiring security guards without a license, he said.

'Did I kill M. Faull? No, let me be clear. I had absolutely nothing to do with the murder in Belize.'

He begged the State Department to expedite visas for his girlfriend. Vanegas had accompanied him when he was on the run, but did not go with him to the U.S.

McAfee said he faked a heart attack in Guatemala to give his lawyer enough time to file motions keeping him from returning to Belize.

'Immediately after, I got well,' he deadpanned.

Speaking to ABC News after landing in Miami, McAfee said admitted that he had 'played the crazy card,' and added: 'It was a deception but who did it hurt? I look pretty healthy, don't I?'

He told the network of his relief when told he wasn't going to be detained by American authorities.

'I was met by a dozen or maybe fewer officers. I said, "Am I arrested?" They said, "No, sir, I am here to help you." That felt the best of all.'

But while seemingly free to roam South Beach, the man who was once worth $100million now says that he has nothing left.

But McAfee's did not appear to be in total arrears as he flashed a stack of $5 bills, telling ABC: 'My friend dropped off some cash.'

He criticized the Belizian authorities for failing to catch him, and thanked reporters for their 'role' in securing his escape.

'Everyone was looking for me, and they did not catch me,' he told ABC. 'I escaped, was captured and they tried to send me back. Now I'm sitting in Miami. There had to be some ineptness.

'What's a better story, millionaire mad man on the run. [The media] saved my ass. Because you paid attention to the story. As long as you are reporting, it is hard to whack somebody that the world is watching.'

When McAfee's plane landed at Miami International Airport last night, he was without a travel companion - his 20-year-old girlfriend Samantha Vanegas, who he left in Guatemala.

After landing, McAfee, 67, was escorted from the plane by airport security officers, and he quickly checked into a hotel in the exclusive South Beach area.

'Some people felt uncomfortable that he 
was on our flight. ... We all knew the story,' said Maria Claridge, 36, a
South Florida photographer who was on the Silicon Valley entrepreneur's
flight to Miami.

McAfee, who was seated in the coach section and had a whole row to himself, was wearing a suit and was 'very calm' during the flight, she added.

'He looked very tired, he looked like a man who hadn't slept in days. I'd say he even looked depressed,' said another passenger, Roberto Gilbert, a Guatemalan who lives in Miami.

McAfee had been held for a week in Guatemala, where he surfaced after evading police in Belize for nearly a month following the killing of Faull, a fellow American and neighbor on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye.

Police in Belize want to quiz McAfee 
as a 'person of interest' in Faull's death, although the technology 
guru's lawyers blocked an attempt by Guatemala to send him back there.

Authorities there say he is not a prime suspect in the investigation. McAfee has denied any role in Faull's killing.

McAfee led the world's media on a game of online hide-and-seek in Belize and Guatemala since he fled after Faull's death, peppering the Internet with pithy quotes and colorful revelations about his unpredictable life.

Residents of the Belizean island of Ambergris Caye, where McAfee has lived for about four years, said McAfee and Faull, 52, had quarreled at times, including over McAfee's unruly dogs.

McAfee belives the cops in Belize authorities will kill him if he turns himself in for questioning.

He has said he was being persecuted by Belize's ruling party after he refused to pay some $2million in bribes.

Belize's prime minister has rejected the allegations, calling McAfee paranoid and 'bonkers.'

Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez said the country still wanted to question McAfee about the Faull case.

'He will be just under the goodwill of the United States of America. He is still a person of interest, but a U.S. national has been killed and he has been somewhat implicated in that murder. People want him to answer some questions," he said.

Martinez noted that Belize's extradition treaty with the United States extended only to suspected criminals, a designation that did not currently apply to McAfee.

'Right now, we don't have enough information to change his status from person of interest to suspect,' he said.
