Silly stunt: Judy and the rubber chicken. Her Grand Slam of public appearances and lucrative business commitments that could make her more than £150,000 in a year

Andy Murray may have cruised through the opening rounds of Wimbledon as reigning champion — but it’s his mum Judy who has taken on a Grand Slam of public appearances and lucrative business commitments that could make her more than £150,000 in a year.

Her week started with an unlikely appearance on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs.

Then we witnessed her ‘ambassadorship’ for Lavazza coffee  — as part of a deal thought to be worth around £25,000, 54-year-old Judy was seen helping to dispense free coffee to Wimbledon fans, and manning a coffee stall with former Wimbledon champ Goran Ivanisevic and Rafa Nadal’s uncle-coach Tony.

A bigger commitment is her deal with Robinsons, the drinks brand that has had a partnership with Wimbledon for more than 100 years.

Among other advertising ventures and coaching initiatives, she has filmed a series of comic skits with former British No 1 Tim Henman, debating whether part of Wimbledon should be called ‘Henman Hill’ or ‘Murray Mount’.

The Robinsons deal, worth around £50,000 and brokered by the leading sports agency IMG, led her this week to take part in a stunt in which she was photographed bouncing a rubber chicken on a tennis racquet.

In past years tennis fans struggled to take Judy to their hearts — all that fist-pumping and clenched aggression made her appear too pushy.

But after Andy’s victory last year, and aided by a makeover that turned her into a glamorous white-blonde, Judy is being seen in a new light. At least, that is the plan.

In a long junior and senior tennis career she won 64 Scottish titles but her victories were never translated into international success.

Instead she launched herself into coaching, and her dream now is to launch a tennis academy in Scotland, preferably near the Murrays’ home town of Dunblane.

‘This is my big goal. I want it to be something to leave behind,’ she has said. But she needs more than £15 million in initial funding, and there will be heavy maintenance costs thereafter — hence the deals with Lavazza and Robinsons, and another as a ‘brand ambassador’ for Head, the racquet maker.

It was Judy, rather than Andy, who gave a cover interview to the Radio Times pre-Wimbledon, in which she spoke about the Dunblane shooting massacre at Andy’s primary school.

She has also started an online column for BT Sport — and now there are unconfirmed reports that she will be a contestant on the next series of Strictly Come Dancing.

A fan of the BBC show, she would be paid £25,000 to take part, rising to £60,000 if she makes the quarter-finals and up to £75,000 for the semis. 

Add in newspaper interviews and shameless flirting with the young comedian Jack Whitehall on his BBC3 Backchat show, and you have what appears to be a concerted media blitz.

Indeed, a glance at Judy’s Twitter (@Judmoo) reveals a media-savvy woman enjoying her moment in the sun.

This week she has plugged her sponsored activities, sent out daily words of encouragement to Andy and his new coach Amelie Mauresmo, and kept followers up to date with her hectic social schedule.

If she is heartbroken by her split from long-term partner Phil Reid, she is hiding it well. They were together for about five years but are thought to have parted in January.

While Judy travels the world supporting Andy and his brother Jamie at tennis tournaments, Andy’s girlfriend Kim stays largely at home.

Coaching is still Judy’s chief passion— and turning that Murray Tennis Academy into a reality. And if that means having to bounce a rubber chicken on a purple novelty tennis racquet for her sponsors, then so be it.
