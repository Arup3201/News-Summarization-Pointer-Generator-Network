So, how does a Prime Minister, who is a self-confessed fitness fanatic, keep in tip-top shape when he's in the outback for a week?

Well Tony Abbott has quite literally been putting the shoulder to the wheel, finding novel ways of exercising even though he's almost 3000 kilometres away from Canberra.

The PM said all along his plan for the week-long trip was 'to gain a better understanding of the needs of people living and working in those areas' and he hasn't shirked the tough stuff.

Hmm, that looks pretty good to me. Job done, the PM inspects a finished table

Among the hard yakka, the PM turned his hand to a bit of carpentry on Tuesday, sanding a stringybark table at the Dharpa Djarmma Furniture Studio in Gunyangara on the Gove Peninsula.

The finishing touches placed on the woodwork, he made his way to a mining training centre, as his pushes ahead at a hectic pace, making good on his promise to spend a week in indigenous communities.

Mr Abbott will be joined by his entire Indigenous advisory council and Aboriginal Australia lawyer and land rights advocate Noel Pearson for a dinner on Wednesday.

Constitutional recognition is sure to be a prime point of discussion, with the PM already flagging a referendum could be put to the Australian people by 2017.

'I think it's important that everyone know where our country is hoping to go,' he said from inside the camp-site.

'There does need to be a clear process in place with an end point for our consideration.'

That'll be a skinny mocha thanks - Tony Abbott's coffee preference  

As for what's on the menu, organisers have certainly taken heed of the PM's love of a cuppa, as tea has been available in plentiful supply.

No shortage either of baked goods - his staff openly admit that he 'loves a scone' and they've been an omnipresent item at morning teas.

NT organisers have promised to throw some 'steaks on the barbecue' for the PM, being one of his favourite Australia dishes but whether he will be tempted by traditional bush tucker, such as the odd witchetty grub, remains to be seen.  

And despite the cringe factor from his entourage, Mr Abbott's preference when ordering coffee is, as always, for a skim mocha.

Mr Abbott will also get his hands dirty when he takes in a tour of a local nursery, having already taken part in seed planting ceremonies at a timber mill.

As ever, the PM is moving at a fast pace, managing to visit and work at both the timber mill and a nearby cattle station, amid some criticism that it's been rather too 'stage-managed'.

Locals say the PM should also find time to hear the concerns of 1100 people now out of a job after Rio Tinto's decision to suspend work at its Gove alumina refinery in the Northern Territory - directly affecting almost a quarter of the town's population.

This stay was an election promise made by Mr Abbott, in which he said, not only that he would find time to stay with remote communities, but he would bring ministers and parliamentary secretaries along as well.

He was greeted on Sunday with a traditional Welcome to Country ceremony by the Yirrkala community on the Gove Peninsula in north-east Arnhem Land by young and old community members.

In a 'very Australian setting' he will remain in constant contact with other world leaders for the duration of his stay via secure connections provided by the Australian Defence Force. Dressed on most days in polo shirts and caps, the PM returns to business as usual shirt and tie when required.

On Monday, the prime minister held a secure Skype-type discussion with the head of ASIO from inside temporary tent village, which is based on the outskirts of Nhulunbuy.

There are up to 40 tents in place.

Mr Abbott said he would continue to hold be able to continue conversations with Aboriginal leaders and local residents and remain 'in touch with what’s happening in Canberra and if things happen in the wider world I need to be able to be on top of them here'. 

He may be mostly out of the white shirt and tie but 'I manage to do my emails, to make my phone calls'.

The PM 'loves a scone' and there have been plenty on the menu in the first three days of his NT trip

Despite Cabinet's decision to deploy troops and news of a bombing raid by American forces on Islamic State targets, Mr Abbott says he is committed to staying in the region until Friday at least and is keeping in close contact with Canberra officials.

Mr Abbott announced the deployment of 600 troops to Iraq just hours before touching down in north-east Arnhem Land. 

The PM is running national affairs from his temporary office, most via teleconference mode and ministers will fly up to participate in events related to their portfolios.

The show must go on. This is how the PM continues doing the 'day to day' business of running the country, via teleconference and through secure connection when speaking with world leaders

The Prime Minister is set to spend his third night sleeping under the stars, in his own tent, surrounded by an around-the-clock security detail. There are few mod-cons, except for the communications equipment - even the holder of the highest office in the land has to make do with a metal stretcher bed.

This is the same site where the annual Garma Festival is hosted, on the Yolngu ceremonial ground. 

There have been critics of the PM's trip north, with some locals suggesting it has been too 'stage-managed'

The original intention of this trip was for Mr Abbott to be completely immersed in Indigenous communities for the entire week, but the crisis overseas has put a twist on that plan.

'Yes, this is a remote place, but in its own way it's the heart of our country,' Mr Abbott said.
