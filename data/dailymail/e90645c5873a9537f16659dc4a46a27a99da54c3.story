Now the victim, Susan Mills, 40, from Margate, Kent, has appeared on ITV show This Morning to speak about her terrifying ordeal.

'I told him not to drink, not to treat me like this and he just got worse and worse.

'I was scared for my life, I thought I was going to die.' 

Canterbury Crown Court heard last week how the couple, who had been together for 21 years, had argued over the parentage of their child. 

A neighbour - who photographed Glenn, 48, grabbing Susan around the neck and holding the knife against her before calling the police - said they heard him shout: 'If I'm going down, I'm going down for something worthwhile.'

The attack took place in their garden after Susan had ran outside in a desperate bid to escape her drunk and violent husband. 

She was able to break free of his clutches and then fled with her daughter to their neighbour's house until the police arrived.

Glenn Mills has been sentenced to three years and eight months after pleading guilty assault by beating, affray and making threats to kill

Glenn was originally charged with attempted murder but on the day of his trial pleaded guilty to assault by beating, affray and making threats to kill.

He was jailed for three years and eight months and the attempted murder charge was left on the file. 

The court heard how he had a previous conviction in October 2012 for battery on his wife when he fractured her fingers.

Speaking on today's This Morning, Susan said these were the attacks that she had been brave enough to report. 

She told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford: 'For the first 16 years of our relationship there had been moments (of domestic violence) but I didn't have the guts or the courage to go to the police until 2010 when he locked me in room. 

'The police had to break in and charged him with false imprisonment. However I later dropped these charges as I felt scared and guilty.'

Susan explained how she met Glenn when she was 18 and they fell in love. 

She said their relationship 'wasn't all bad, we did have happy times' but he became increasingly jealous and controlling.

'He was really jealous of my friends, he told me I was ugly and fat and no other man would ever want me,' she said.

She added that her mother always had reservations about her husband.

'She saw the signs, she didn't like Glenn at all. When this happened last year she cried her eyes out and said "I can't believe he nearly killed you."'

Susan agreed to appear on ITV to share her story after a report published today revealed that domestic abuse victims suffer on average for three years before they get help.

On today's This Morning, Susan told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford, right, that victims of domestic abuse should not 'put up with it' but seek help immediately

Some women suffer more than 50 incidents of abuse before it stops and almost a quarter of high-risk victims had to go to an A&E department because of their injuries. 

Susan hopes her story will encourage other victims not to delay in seeking help.

She urged: 'My advice would be don't put up with it, people don't change, once they start hitting you and threatening you, they won't stop. Get out now and seek help. 

'Go to the police. I'm 40 now and I feel like the last 20 years have been a waste.' 

She added that she's had counselling and her family have been a great support so she's now trying to move on with her life.
