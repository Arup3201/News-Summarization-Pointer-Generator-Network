Just two servings of fish a week can slash the risk of hearing loss by a fifth, according to a new study.

Oily fish such as sardines, salmon and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have already been shown to stave off heart disease, dementia, cancer, depression and arthritis. Now a study of women has shown that consumption can lower the risk of deafness.

US researchers looked at a study of 65,215 nurses who were followed between 1991 and 2009, during which time 11,606 cases of hearing loss were reported. In comparison with women who rarely consumed fish, those who ate it at least twice a week were 20 per cent less likely to develop deafness.

The study was published online by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. One of the authors – Dr Sharon Curhan of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston – said acquired hearing loss was often a disabling chronic health condition.

She added: ‘Although a decline in hearing is often considered an inevitable aspect of ageing the identification of several potentially modifiable risk factors has provided new insight into possibilities for prevention or delay of acquired hearing loss.

Doctors say that eating fish, which is packed with vitamins and minerals, on a regular basis can help stave off a range of serious diseases and help protect health in later life

‘Consumption of any type of fish – tuna, dark fish, light fish or shellfish – tended to be associated with lower risk. These findings suggest diet may be important in the prevention of acquired hearing loss.’

Doctors say that eating fish, which is packed with vitamins and minerals, on a regular basis can help stave off a range of serious diseases and help protect health in later life. A previous study in 2008 found that eating oily fish two or more times a week could reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration – a common cause of blindness in older people.

Research from 2004 also suggests that consumption of oily fish helped protect against heart disease, while other studies have found that it can lower blood pressure and reduce the build up of fat in arteries.

Alison Hornby, a spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, states on the NHS website: ‘The benefits of eating at least two portions of fish a week, including one of oily fish, include keeping your blood pressure at a healthy level and improving blood lipids, both of which reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, the biggest killer in the UK.

‘You can get your omega-3 from a range of oily fish. Tinned sardines and mackerel are an easy way to stock up the store cupboard.’
