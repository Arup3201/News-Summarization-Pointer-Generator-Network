The name of the woman whose vile racist rant on a train in Sydney went viral this week is not Sue Wilkins, as previously thought, but Karen Bailey.

Ms Bailey, 55, was stopped by police yesterday when she got off the train in Strathfield and gave them a false name.

It has also emerged that Ms Bailey has worked as a legal secretary in some of the country's top law firms and the Crown Solicitors Office.

Video footage was filmed this week on a Sydney train where a woman hurled racist abuse at an Asian woman by mocking her accent and pulling her eyes back to imitate slant eyes

The racist woman then turned her attention to the man filming the scene, who was next to the Asian woman, saying he 'can't even get a regular girlfriend, it's so sad, he's got to get a gook'

Her LinkedIn profile, which has been deleted, said she worked at law firms including Avant Law, Baker & McKenzie, Sparke Helmore, Norton White and Herbert Smith Freehills.

Chief Inspector Rod Peet from Wyong police told MailOnline she made up the name 'Sue Wilkins'.

Ms Bailey was arrested last night after a member of the public recognised Ms Bailey from the video and contacted police.

She was charged with offensive conduct, which carries a maximum penalty of $660 and three months imprisonment.

It was revealed this morning that Ms Bailey abused other passengers on the train, swearing in the face of a 10-year-old boy and telling a grandmother to move her 'f***ing bogan children off the seat'.

Lake Macquarie mother Jade Marr said that Ms Bailey verbally abused her children, Kendall, 10, and Jackson, 7, who were on an outing to Sydney to see the Lion King stage show before she launched into a racist tirade against an Asian passenger.

Ms Marr said Bailey approached her children and mother who were sitting together on a three-seater seat in the packed carriage and told them to move.

'She walked straight on the train, looked at my mum and said “get your f...ing bogan children off the seat." Then she said "there are people here that need to sit down, I want to sit down,"' Ms Marr told the Newcastle Herald.

Ms Marr said that when the children didn't move, Bailey began swearing and when Ms Marr asked her to stop swearing, she responded by  'screaming the f-word in my son's face 10 times. She said “you need to learn this word kid,"' reported the Newcastle Herald.

Bailey told the children, who later in the journey gave up their seats for two elderly passengers, that she was going to call the police to report them for not moving off the seats to accommodate her.

Ms Marr said she had no intention make her children move for a bully like Bailey.

Kareem Abdulm, who uploaded the original video on YouTube of Bailey's racist rant said he began filming just after Bailey was aggressive to the children.

'This video begins just after she had started screaming expletives into the face of the upset kids and the mother of the children got up to stand in between the lady and her kids,' he wrote.

'The lady then assaulted the mother and a young dude who gave up his seat for her.'

The man filmed the woman complaining to police on the phone about the children who would not offer her their seats.

In the footage, Bailey makes racist comments and racist gestures toward a young, Asian, female passenger who refuses to give up her seat to Wilkins.

She also targets the man filming the scene, who was next to the Asian woman, saying he 'can't even get a regular girlfriend, it's so sad, he's got to get a gook'.

'He's too lazy to jerk off, he can only get a gook,' the rant continued.

'Gook' is a derogatory term for people of Asian descent which started in the Vietnam War.

Ms Bailey apologised to the victim after the video went public and acknowledged there were no excuse for such offensive behaviour.

'It's awful and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, regardless of any race,' she said in an exclusive interview with Ninemsn.

'It's not nice what I did to that lady.'

The train was traveling from Newcastle and Central Coast Line as some commuters warned the woman that she would be charged with assault when they arrived at Strathfield station, Sydney's inner west

Bailey, who had recently returned from Holland to live with family in the Central Coast in Sydney's north, said she was having a 'rotten day'.

'I've been chasing work for quite some time now. It's awful what I said to that woman, I do agree,' she said.

'It wasn't nice to say that to her because it's not nice when people say that to me ... call me white trash and fatso. I know how it hurts and I shouldn't be saying it to other people.'

Bailey said she has been the victim of a $100,000 scam by a mystery Dutchman, whom she met on dating website RSVP.

After she caused a scene inside the carriage, police first spoke to Ms Wilkins on Wednesday when she alighted at Strathfield in Sydney's west.

They decided to let her 'go about her journey', NSW Police Transport Command Assistant Commissioner Max Mitchell told reporters.

Sydney Trains chief executive Howard Collins - the former boss of London Underground - added that he had not seen anything like it in 37 years as a transport executive.

The incident occured at about 4pm on Wednesday on a northbound train heading from Sydney's Central station to the NSW central coast.

This isn't the first incident of its kind in Australia, where two young women kicked and spat on a vision-impaired elderly man on a Gold Coast bus, Brisbane's south, in September.

A Melbourne man was also jailed for 21 days in March after racially abusing a French tourist on a bus in 2012.

Another racist attack on public transport involved an ABC newsreader Jeremy Fernandez, where he was subject to a 15-minute rant on a Sydney bus in April last year, was told go back to his country and called a 'black c***'.

Fernandez declined to comment on this week's abuse when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.

Vic Alhadeff, Chairman of NSW Community Relations Commission, described the recent abuse as a 'despicable act'.

'(It) violates everything that we stand for as a proudly multicultural state which embraces diversity and celebrates difference, he said.

'Such outbursts of racism demean us as a society, and we encourage all who witness such offensive behaviour in future to condemn it immediately and unreservedly.'

NSW Minister for Transport Gladys Berejiklian said she is 'disgusted by any kind of racism or threatening behaviour towards customers using public transport'.

A Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink spokeswoman said they condemn any form of abuse on their services.

'The safety of our customer is our priority and we will continue to work with the Police Transport Command to respond to these incidents,' she said.

Witnesses should contact police on Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
