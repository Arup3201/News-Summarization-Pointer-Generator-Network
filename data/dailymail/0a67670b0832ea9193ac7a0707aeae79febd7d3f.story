She has glossy hair, pouty lips and flawless skin.

So you'd be forgiven for imagining Cat Deeley spends hours in front of the mirror before leaving the house.

But the laid-back TV presenter has revealed it takes her just five minutes to get ready - and that she prefers to wear no make-up at all.

Cat Deeley, an Ambassador for Pantene Pro-V, says her preferred look is a natural one, and that when it comes to make-up she finds 'less is more'

Speaking in an interview as Pantene 
Pro-V's Ambassador, promoting the haircare brand's work with charity Cancer Hair 
Care, the British star said her favourite look is one that is as natural
as possible.

The 35-year-old Birmingham beauty also flagged up her top beauty tip as 'less is more', and admitted that if she doesn't have to wear make-up she won't.

She also said that looking after herself on the inside means she looks best on the outside.

Deeley said: 'I think if you look after yourself 
on a regular basis, and do the prep beforehand, you don't need to put 
lots of effort into looking good. It's about finding the right balance –
if you have a good diet, drink lots of water, exercise regularly and 
sleep, you won't look bad on a regular basis.

'Then
you can afford the occasional naughty slip up once in a while, going 
out and having a delicious glass of wine with friends, having a great 
laugh and chat then realizing its 2am isn't so bad – you've put in the 
hard work!'

Cat Deeley, 35, says that keeping yourself healthy on the inside (by getting regular sleep and exercise, and by eating well and drinking lots of water) is the key to looking good on the outside

The bubbly TV personality, who moved to LA  six years ago and currently lives in Beverly Hills with her comedian boyfriend Patrick Kielty, also described herself as a 'low maintenance girl' who likes nothing more than leaving her skin au naturel.

3. Clinique Lip Glosses

4. Kiehls Crème de Corps

5. Chanel Eye Cream

She said: 'When I'm not working, I'm as natural as possible. I try to do very little when I don't have to.

'I find that if I have 
regular 'maintenance' treatments, I can be ready to go out in five 
minutes.

'I get my hair coloured, have regular massages, and love 
getting my lashes tinted and my brows shaped.

'Plus heaps of exercise, 
and as much sleep as possible.

'That way when I'm going out all I have to
do is slick on some gloss, and a bit of blush and I am ready to go!

'Of 
course the LA sun helps too.'

The star also provided a sneak-peek 
into her bathroom cupboard, revealing that her five favourite beauty 
products are Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Instant Nourishing Spray, SK-II 
face masks, Clinique lip glosses, Kiehls Creme De Corps and Chanel eye 
cream.

Cat Deeley has lived in LA for the last six years, and shares a mansion in Beverly Hills with her boyfriend, comedian Patrick Kielty

Speaking about her fashion influences, Deeley said that living in LA means she misses the way British women dress, particularly the style of female Londoners: 'everyone is so individual and unique.'

She added: 'I love all the vintage stores in LA, and the really relaxed vibe of having just spent the day 
at the beach. But I do love and miss the London high street.

Deeley has paired up with Pantene Pro-V to promote Cancer Hair Care, a charity which provides support to women undergoing chemotherapy for cancer throughout the entire hair loss and regrowth process.

The presenter said: 'I understand how important hair is to a woman's self-esteem and confidence. Having met many people fighting cancer and being an avid supporter of the cause, both in the UK and US, I'm supporting this campaign to help make hair loss one less worry.

'As well as running a free supportive information website, Cancer Hair Care run "Hair Care Support Units" and clinics in hospitals, offering support and education to other charities.

'They also provide a huge number of free head scarves, wig services, new hair growth advice and cuts and colours. Jasmin Julia Gupta, the Founder, also runs a free coffee, cake and confidence morning, which is very popular.  This is in addition to fundraising.'

In her role as Pantene Ambassador, Deeley made a video with five women who have all dealt with hair loss through cancer treatment.

She added: 'All of their stories were varied, however the one thing that really stood out to me was how positive they remained, they really are great ambassadors for this charity.

'Working on this campaign has made me realise what a difference you can make to the lives of these women. By helping provide more support and advice, we're helping them through the treatment process. I'm so pleased to be part of the team that helps drive awareness around this small charity.'
