Mario Balotelli showed how pleased he is to be back in the Italy squad after his first call-up from boss Antonio Conte by posting a smiling image with his team-mates, including some of his closest rivals for a place in the team, on Instagram.

Former Juventus manager Conte left Balotelli out of the first two squads of his reign and after including him for this international window has made it clear the Liverpool striker's place at training, let alone in games, is far from safe.

But Balotelli appears to be singing from the appropriate hymn book in the lead-up to the Azzurri's key Euro 2016 qualifier against Croatia in Milan on Sunday. 

'Great guys! Amazing football players,' Mario Balotelli (second left) captions this image with rival Italy strikers Simone Zaza (left), Stephan El Shaarawy (second right)  along with former Milan team-mate Mattia De Sciglio

He posted a shot of himself with fellow strikers Simone Zaza (Sassuolo) and Stephan El Shaarawy (AC Milan), along with Mattia De Sciglio, another former Milan team-mate.

'Friends,' he captioned the image. 'Let's follow them! Great guys! Amazing football players.'

The post is a far cry from Balotelli's cheeky jesture at the World Cup when he filled a Panini album with stickers of himself for the amusement of his Facebook followers after his goal in Italy's 2-1 win over England.

After not hitting the target in the next two matches which saw Italy bow out in the group stage and Costa Rica and Uruguay progress, there was a backlash of sorts from his senior team-mates.

Daniele De Rossi said: 'We need real men, not Panini stickers or characters. These are of no use to the national team.'

Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon added: 'On the pitch, you see who people really are or are not.'

Balotelli became a scapegoat some say after that ill-fated campaign in Brazil, but defender Giorgio Chiellini spoke in support of the talented if inconsistent forward as Italy prepared for Sunday's match and said there was no issue between Balotelli and the squad.

'There is nothing to mend,' he said. 'The coach has made his choice and there is nothing to add.

'Things went badly in Brazil but we have put a lid on that.

'I understand that it is important for the media to know how many times Mario goes to the bathroom, how often he sneezes and how many times he has called his mother.

'But Balotelli is as good as De Rossi, Buffon and the newcomers. What is important is that on Sunday we will be at one.'

Conte, who led Juve to three Serie A titles in a row before replacing Cesare Prandelli after the World Cup debacle, has put the ball firmly in Balotelli's court as to whether his stay with the Italy set-up is a short or long term.

“If he does as I say, then good, he could be on the team or on the bench or indeed in the grandstand,' Conte said. 'If he doesn’t, well then the doors here at Coverciano (Italian team training centre) are revolving. You can come in and you can go out. We won’t be seeing you anymore and Amen.”
