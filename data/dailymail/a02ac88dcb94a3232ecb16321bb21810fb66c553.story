A 10-year-old boy has managed to escape the clutches of a kidnapper by singing a gospel song until the suspect couldn't stand it anymore and let him free.

Police say Willie Myrick was abducted by a man from his Atlanta, Georgia driveway, on March 31.

The suspect allegedly lured him with cash and then, when he was close enough, grabbed him and pulled him into his car.

They then drove around for three hours before the man dropped Willie off unharmed in East Point.

But Willie's actions during that terrifying time probably saved his life. 

Willie said he sang the gospel song 'Every Praise' repeatedly until the man told him to get out of the car.

Willie said while he was singing, the man kept cursing and telling him to shut up before eventually kicking him out.

'He opened the door and threw me out,' Willie told WXIA-TV. 'He told me not to tell anyone.'

On Thursday, community leaders came together to warn other parents and children about the kidnapping and celebrate the little boy's bravery and quick thinking.

The man who wrote the song - Grammy Award-winning gospel singer Hezekiah Walker - even traveled from New York to congratulate Willie in person.

'It's just emotional to me because you never know who you're going to touch,' Walker told 11Alive.

He said after hearing the moving story and how his song had potentially saved a life,  he wanted to meet Willie.

'I just wanted to hug him and tell him I love him,' Walker said.

Tears streamed down Willie's face as Walker hugged him.

Walker then led the church, and Willie, in singing 'Every Praise.'

'I really believe that God spoke through me to save that young man's life,' Walker said.

Police have not yet tracked down the man who abducted Willie, but they have released a sketch of the suspect and are appealing to the community for leads.
