A retired couple have been forced to evacuate their home after a massive landslip engulfed their back garden.

Phil and Gill Lee were told to leave their home of 34 years near Stroud, Gloucestershire, after the B4058 tumbled towards the back of the property.

Hundreds of tons of earth, railings and asphalt slumped into their garden, destroying their gazebo and burying their shed.

Devastation: The aftermath of the landslide 
which has buried Phil and Gill Lee's back garden at their home in 
Stroud, Gloucestershire. The retired couple evacuated the property
 out of fear that worse may be to come

The couple are furious because nothing was done to shore up the road when cracks were first reported in it a year ago.

Work began in October, by which time the pavement had dropped by a foot. But then it was too little, too late.

On New Year's Eve, Mr and Mrs Lee heard an awful rumbling noise before earth and rocks came tumbling down the steep bank behind their back garden and towards their semi.

It just missed their neighbours' home.

The couple are now staying with friends while Gloucestershire County Council highways authority makes the area safe. The road, which runs from Nailsworth to Horsley, has been shut since the landslide.

Mrs Lee, 64, said: 'We heard this awful rumbling noise. We found the bank in our garden and in next door’s garden. It has just missed our neighbour by a few feet.'

She added: 'It makes me nervous, wondering is any more going to fall down?'

'Nervous': Mr and Mrs Lee in front of the bank 
where hundreds of tons of earth, railings and asphalt tumbled down 
towards their home on New Year's Eve. They're angry nothing was done to 
shore up the road before

Mr Lee, 63, a former electrical engineer, is angry that the council did not act more quickly after cracks were first reported in the road more than a year ago.

Temporary traffic lights were installed to prevent traffic using the lane nearest the edge. But Mr Lee said: 'My argument is that they knew about the problem for a long while.

'If they had only carried out work earlier in the year, before the winter set in, I don’t think it would have happened.

'The cracks got worse. Nothing happened until October and by this time the pavement had dropped by about a foot. There still seems to be little or no urgency.'

Vernon Smith, Gloucestershire County Council cabinet member for Highways, said: 'We’d begun work and had set ourselves realistic timescales that considered the possibility of bad weather.

'We’d planned to continue the work after the winter months had passed, if we’d begun the work prior to the recent rainfall we’d now be faced with further delays and the situation would be much worse.

'As a result of the heavy rain we had to ask two households to stay with friends or relatives as a precautionary measure.'
