Two businessmen from Massachusetts narrowly escaped death last month when a giant boulder crashed through the windshield of their rental as they made their way through a narrow canyon in Arizona. 

Bob Jaczko, 74, of Natick, was behind the wheel of a Dodge SUV enjoying the scenery of Sedona when suddenly he and his passenger heard a rumbling sound.

In the next moment, a 150-pound boulder plummeted from a canyon wall and crashed through the glass, according to Jaczko.

‘All of a sudden I thought the car exploded,’ he told the Boston Globe. ‘I thought the engine blew up.’

Jaczko, a marketing communications director for Integrated Dynamics Engineering, traveled to Arizona with sales manager Peter Wilson, 45, of Attleboro, for a trade show.

After getting their booth ready for the event, Jaczko and his companion decided to do some sightseeing. On the advice of a tour guide, the pair chose to take a ride through the scenic Oak Creek Canyon, putting them on a collision course with the massive rock. 

The 74-year-old driver said that the windshield shattered into a million razor-sharp pieces and covered them with shards of glass that looked like ‘sprinkles on an ice cream cone,’ WHDH reported.

Luckily for the pair, the two-foot by one-foot boulder fell onto the dashboard first and then tumbled into the space between the driver’s and passenger’s seats.

‘I looked down and we had dials and wires in our laps,’ Jaczko said. ‘We stopped and looked down and I’m wearing a rock on my left side.’

Two nurses who happened to be traveling in cars behind Jaczko and Wilson pulled over and rushed to their aid.

‘When the rock rolled down my left arm it was like a vegetable peeler, took off all this skin,’ Jaczko said.

After realizing he and Wilson were not seriously hurt, Jaczko pulled his camera out and photographed the shattered Dodge with the boulder still resting in the front seat.

The two bloodied men were transported to a nearby hospital to be treated for cuts and bruises.

Jaczko said he could not believe that he and Wilson walked away without any serious injuries from their harrowing encounter with the giant rock.

‘I thought, “Oh my God, we survived this,”’ he said. ‘I thought, “this is really a lucky day.”’

Jaczko noted that before the incident, he and his co-worker visited a Catholic chapel, threw pennies into a magic stream and then went to a crystal shop.

‘We had all this mysticism around us so I think we were well protected,’ he told WBZ-TV

Police who arrived on the scene told the lucky pair that a recent rain storm must have loosened the soil under the rock.

After their unexpected detour to the hospital, the men returned to Phoenix and finished their trade show on a high note.

‘We
were the talk of the trade show!’ Jaczko said. ‘We had a very crowded 
booth which was good for publicity. But I think I’ll do something 
different next time!’
