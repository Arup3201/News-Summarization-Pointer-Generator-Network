As wedding season looms on the horizon there is bad news for maids of honour, bridesmaids and best men everywhere as it is revealed that the cost of being part of the ceremony just keeps on rising.

The average Briton spent over £750 in 2012 helping family and friends celebrate their big day.

A new YouGov survey has revealed that Brits 
splash the cash on parties, presents, accommodation and travel 
throughout the wedding calendar with women spending around 19 
per cent more than men (£857.69 vs £721.57).

You may be happy for them, but bridesmaids are likely to be less happy about the £700 they spend helping their friend celebrate

The average Briton spent over £750 in 2012 attending the nuptials of their nearest and dearest.

Having a role as part of the wedding party means even more strain placed on the purse: the average bridesmaid spends over £732 on each wedding they attend while the best man doesn’t fare much better, spending on average over £625 per event.

The survey, which  was commissioned to celebrate the DVD release of wedding day rom-com, The Knot,  showed that the average couple spends over £1,500 a year attending the weddings of friends and family, and it seems the price only rises with age

Couples who are 55 and over spend over £500 more than their younger counter parts, parting with an astonishing £2000 a year, while solo wedding attendees over 55 spend £1200 per year.

The cost of throwing the stag or hen their 'do' can add substantially to the cost for the bridesmaids and best man

Bridesmaid's often have to buy their own dress for the ceremony, which added to the cost of travel, accommodation, the hen do and a present, means costs can get very high

Londoners spent the most per wedding as guests (£697.74) putting to shame the rest of those from the South of England (£463.94) and the East who spent just over a meagre £200 at each wedding. 

However, Southerners were revealed as spending around 17 per cent more than Northerners overall.

Those in full-time employment spent on average £749 in 2012 attending weddings, almost double that of the 30 unemployed respondents interviewed, who were revealed to be spending around £390 a year on attending weddings.
