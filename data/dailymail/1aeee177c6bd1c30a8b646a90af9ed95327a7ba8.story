Outside court: Chloe Brennan, 40, insisted at London's High Court that her father's siblings had 'never liked her and didn't want to know her'

As the only child of a wealthy diplomat’s son, she was treated like a ‘princess’ by her father and believed he had promised to leave her his fortune.

So Chloe Brennan was shocked to learn after he died that his siblings had ‘encouraged’ him to sign a deathbed will they had drawn-up without legal advice which left the bulk of his estate to them.

She launched a High Court battle to have the will declared invalid, accusing relatives of her father, Francois Devillebichot, of conspiring to cheat her out of £500,000 of her inheritance.

But yesterday a judge threw out her claim, ruling that despite suspicions there was no proof that the will was unlawful.

Mrs Brennan, 40, alleged her father’s siblings never liked her because she had ‘shamed’ their respectable family by being born out of wedlock.

Her grandfather, Georges Devillebichot, was a French diplomat who lived in London and married an English woman, setting up home in Knightsbridge and raising their four children.

But his son Francois went through a hippy stage and was not married to Mrs Brennan’s mother when she was born in 1972, causing his family to resent her, she claimed.

Despite this, she said her father ‘treated her like a princess’ and promised on her wedding day that he would leave everything to her.

But after he died of throat cancer aged 65 in 2011, she learnt that the will he had signed days earlier left most of his £620,000 estate – including his home in Harrow, North London and flat in Cannes – to his sisters Anne and Lucille, his brother Phillippe and the children of a third sister, Jackie.

Property: When her father Francois Devillebichot succumbed to cancer in March 2011, the home-made will was produced, leaving the bulk of his fortune - including Harrow home (pictured) - to his sisters and brother

Involved: Claiming that her father promised to leave her everything on her wedding day, Mrs Brennan accused his sisters Jackie, and Anne (pictured), who is in her 60s, of being 'part of a conspiracy'

Mrs Brennan, who had become 
financially dependent on her father after she was diagnosed with 
multiple sclerosis, was left only £100,000, the High Court was told.

She
claimed the siblings exerted ‘undue influence’ on their dying brother 
to get him to sign the will.

‘I
am the only child of my father,’ Mrs Brennan said. ‘We had a close 
father-daughter relationship.

'He knew of my medical condition and we 
discussed financial matters before his death. My father thought he was 
leaving his estate to me.’

Evidence: Miss Brennan told London's High Court (pictured) that her father and mother - whom he met in his 'hippy' days - were not married when she was born and felt her existence 'brought shame on the family'

Picturesque: Also included in the fortune was a flat in the luxury holiday resort of Cannes in south-east France

She added: ‘The siblings took advantage of my father’s admission to hospital by making and arranging the will.

A lawyer does not have to be present when a will is drawn up or altered for it to be legal.

Only a few things are required to make a will – or an amendment to it – legal.

It must be made voluntarily in writing by someone of sound mind who is over 18.

And it has to be signed in the presence of two adult witnesses, who must themselves also both sign the will in the presence of the person making it.

The witnesses cannot be beneficiaries of the will.

A will can be changed by making an official alteration called a codicil, which must be signed and witnessed in the same way as when it is drawn up, or by making a fresh will.

The will should name the beneficiaries and say what should happen if they die before the person making the will.

The will should also name the executor.

Although lawyers are not a legal requirement, the Government advises getting legal advice unless the will is simple.

‘If
he did sign the will, he was compelled to sign any document put before 
him, without ever knowing the full and real contents of it or its 
implications. The circumstances around the making of the will raise 
suspicion.’

Mrs Brennan, 
from Reading, claimed that after her father’s death his siblings refused
to accept that she was his child and she had to undergo DNA testing and
obtain a court order to prove her paternity.

But
Luke Harris, for the siblings, fiercely denied this claim and said the 
way Mr Devillebichot’s assets were divided was ‘perfectly 
understandable’.

He said 
the £100,000 left to Mrs Brennan ‘reflected his favourable treatment of 
his daughter during his life’ and the fact that he was ‘getting tired’ 
of giving her money.

Judge 
Mark Herbert QC ruled that despite the ‘colossal distrust’ that blighted
the family, Mrs Brennan’s father had not been subjected to any ‘undue 
influence’ and knew what he was doing when he signed the will.

He
recognised that suspicions were raised by the absence of legal advice 
and the fact that the will was ‘encouraged and drawn up by members of 
the family who stand to benefit under it’.

But
dismissing Mrs Brennan’s challenge, the judge said her accusations of 
dishonesty were not backed up by evidence that the will had been 
executed wrongly according to law.
