A dispute between devout Christians and atheists in one California city has forced officials to ban nativity scenes in public.

Santa Monica City Council voted unanimously to scrap a rule that allowed churches, synagogues and atheists to set up displays in Palisades Park at Christmas.

Burbank atheist Raymond McNealy said he was outraged that church organisations were demanding exclusive rights to the site, while others erected protest signs in the park.

'As our banner urged: "Reason Has Prevailed", Annie Laurie Gaylor, founder and co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation told The Huffington Post.

But churchgoers are upset that the holiday tradition has been scuppered.

Traditionally, the area had featured 14 life-sized scenes showing the birth of Jesus along Ocean Avenue, but following growing demand for space from non-believers, it was reduced in size dramatically last year.

The city had received a record number of requests for pitches in 2011, so it adopted a lottery system, which left the traditionalists with just two spots, it was reported by KTLA.com.

That was enough for just three scenes, the smallest it has been for some 57 years.

As the war of words grew, residents spoke of their concerns about First Amendment issues and city officials said they had received threats.

In a bid to end the dispute, the council opted to stop the lottery system and end the displays altogether in a bid to bring harmony back to the community.
