Parking signs in New Zealand's biggest city are under threat - from prostitutes who are swinging round the metal poles to entice customers.

In the past 18 months over 40 poles have been bent, buckled or broken in one area of south Auckland, it is claimed.

'Prostitutes use these (street sign poles) as dancing poles,' said Donna Lee, a member of the city council's Otara-Papatoetoe Local Board.

'The poles are part of their soliciting equipment and they often snap them. Some of the prostitutes are big, strong people,' she added reported Stuff.Nz. 

Her claims were detailed in a book which has accounts from business owners and residents highlighting the challenges they face from prostitution in Papatoetoe.

It lists the reasons why a bill is needed to ban prostitution from certain areas of Manukau.

It is aimed at putting pressure on parliamentarians who will soon have to vote on the bill and has the backing of Auckland Mayor Len Brown.

Action: A local community have been protesting to get a bill passed which would ban street workers from some residential, school and sports areas

Street workers would be banned from some residential, school and sports areas if the Bill is passed.

The bill would impose fines of $2000 on prostitutes and their clients in areas specified as off-limits and police could arrest people on suspicion of prostitution or soliciting. 

Papatoetoe local John Lee told TVNZ he was forced to move from the area when the prostitution became too much.

'A couple against the fence were copulating and my ten-year-old daughter was awake and screamed out at them and that's when we decided we have to go,' he said.

Another local called Bernie Taylor said 'We had a parcel delivered to us recently and the address was 'Hooker's Corner' and it found its way to us with no problems whatsoever.'

But Prostitute Collective Auckland spokeswoman Annah Pickering believes outlawing popular streets will only encourage sex workers to stop carrying condoms to avoid getting caught.

'They'll be expected to pay a fine, which they can't pay,' she explained. 

Since the sex trade was decriminalised by the previous Labour government in 2003, New Zealand has some of the most liberal prostitution laws in the world.

A previous attempt to outlaw all street prostitution in Manukau was defeated in Parliament in 2006.
