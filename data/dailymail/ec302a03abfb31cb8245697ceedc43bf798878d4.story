It manages just six miles to the gallon and has a top speed of only 60mph.

But this 100-year-old Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost has zoomed into the world record books, selling at auction for almost £5million following a fierce bidding war.

It was originally bought for £1,000 in 1912 (almost £93,000 in today’s money) but has now gone under the hammer for £4,705,500, making it the most expensive Rolls-Royce ever sold at auction.

Through the roof: The lengthy auction saw two enthusiasts duelling for the pristine car as the bidding went up in increments of £100,000, smashing past the £2million estimate

What it lacks in gadgetry, the British-made classic more than compensates for with an extraordinary level of luxury that leaves its modern-day counterparts looking a little unsophisticated.

Its gleaming interior fittings are made of silver and ivory, while the door panels are embroidered silk, with brocade tassels attached to silk window shades for privacy.

The passenger footrest hides a full picnic set for four, a china tea service, complete with an alcohol-fuelled burner and kettle to heat the water, and a set of six decanters – three in sterling silver and three in leather-wrapped glass.

The sale took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex on Friday. Auctioneers had expected it to sell for around £2million and were astonished when the bidding between two rival collectors topped £4million.

James Knight, from Bonhams auctioneers, said: ‘There were three bidders, then one of them dropped out at £2.3million and we thought it would end there.

‘But then another bidder entered and the bidders were duelling. It went up in increments of £50,000, and then £100,000, and then back down to £50,000.

‘It went on and on and on and was the longest car sale I have ever witnessed. It was pure theatre. Everyone was very respectful but when the price reached a milestone, like £3million, there was an intake of breath.

‘The bidders were duelling and when the hammer came down there was spontaneous applause.

‘It was fitting because the car is celebrating her centenary.’

The car was commissioned by Rolls-Royce connoisseur John M. Stephens, who also bought the first Silver Ghost the luxury car-maker produced in 1906. The body was built by former royal carriage-maker Barker’s of Mayfair, which had previously built coaches for King George III and Queen Victoria.

Touch of class: The original owner employed the services of the best coach-making company, Barker and Co. Ltd, to do the bodywork

Classic designs: One of the car's brake lights. The Rolls-Royce still had its headlights, carriage lights, rear lights and inflatable tyres when it went up for sale

Unlike most car enthusiasts of his 
time, Mr Stephens, from Croydon, South London, asked the makers not to 
include a glass division window between the driver and the passengers as
he wanted to drive it himself rather than rely on a chauffeur.

The car even had an early speedometer – an important addition given that a 20mph speed limit was introduced in 1912.

The
car’s distinctive cream and green design echoed the luxury ‘Pullman’ 
Railway carriages of the time, and it was known as a Double Pullman 
Limousine.

But it was nicknamed ‘the Corgi Silver Ghost’ in the 1960s after the toy-maker based its Silver Ghost toy car on this model.

Mr
Stephens’s car is believed to be the only one of its kind to survive 
with its full interior and bodywork, as many Rolls-Royces from the era 
were converted into ambulances during the First World War.

Auctioneer Bonhams said: ‘It is a 
statement of refinement, grace and gentility that for many defines the 
qualities and the Edwardian period in which Rolls-Royce established the 
unsurpassed reputation it still enjoys today.’

The
identity of the anonymous telephone bidders has not been revealed but 
sadly Bonhams has confirmed the car will now be leaving Britain once 
more.

It left Britain in 
1992 after it was bought by a US enthusiast. A Texas lawyer bought it 
from him in 2007 for £1.9million and kept it until 2009, when he was 
killed in a crash in a different car.

The
Rolls was then sold once again before the latest seven-hour auction, 
which saw more than 80 cars go under the hammer for a combined 
£22million.

Astonishingly, 
the Silver Ghost was not the most expensive lot. That honour went to a 
1929 ‘Blower’ Bentley single-seater racing car, which sold for 
£5,042,000, the highest price ever for a British car at auction.

In
1932, fighter pilot and Le Mans winner Sir Henry Birkin set a 137mph 
speed record in the Bentley, described as the Concorde of its time.
