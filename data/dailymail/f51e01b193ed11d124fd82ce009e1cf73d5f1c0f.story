A poster of a notorious Nazi concentration camp has been pulled from sales by Walmart and other leading retailers after online shoppers were horrified to discover it was being sold as a piece of home decor.

The image shows a gate at Dachau with the phrase 'Arbeit macht frei,' which translates to 'work makes you free' written in the metal.

The stores were inundated with complaints after it was spotted by outraged shoppers and Walmart, Amazon and Sears decided to remove the item from sale at the weekend

Walmart apologised for the photo and said the item was sold by one of the company's online marketplace sellers and not directly by Walmart.

'We were horrified to see that this item was on our site. We sincerely apologize, and worked quickly to remove it,' a statement from Walmart read reported ABC News.

'The item was sold through a third-party seller on our marketplace.

'We have shared our disappointment with them and have learned they are removing the publisher of this item entirely from inventory.'

Sears pulled the poster from its website, though a description remained that called the poster a 'generic Gate with inscription Arbeit Macht Frei, Dachau Concentration Camp, Dachau, Upper Bavaria, Bavaria, Germany Poster Print by Pa.'

Sears said this in a statement: 'The item, which was listed by an independent third-party on Sears Marketplace, violates our guidelines and was immediately removed.'

Amazon did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for comment.

The events that unfolded in Dachau continue to haunt the world years after it first opened its gates on March 22, 1933.

More than 188,000 political prisoners, Jews and other groups persecuted by the Nazis were kept in Dachau, which was used as a labor camp and place where medical experiments took place.

In a final act of cruelty, guards at the camp forced more than 7,000 prisoners, most of them Jewish, on a death march as American troops drew close in April 1945.

Many of the starved and weak prisoners who struggled to keep up were shot dead.

Those who survived were liberated by the Allies in May

In June auctioneers were condemned by Jewish leaders after selling off a haul of Nazi memorabilia in Adelaide. 

About 20 items from the First and Second World War went under the hammer 
and were sold to military enthusiasts willing to fork out between $300 
and $700 for a slice of Third Reich history.

But Jewish Community Council of South 
Australia president Norman Schueler said auction house Mason Gray 
Strange should have known better than to remind survivors of the 
Holocaust and their families of the horrific time.

Last year an investigation by the Daily Mail revealed how online auction site eBay was profiting from the 
sickening trade in Holocaust relics.

It
 caused global outrage and led to an apology from eBay, which removed 30
 items from sale – including the uniform – and pledged to make a £25,000
 donation to charity.
