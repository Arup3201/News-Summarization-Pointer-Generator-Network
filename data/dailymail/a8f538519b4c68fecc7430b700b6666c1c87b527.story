Islamic State militants have 'massacred' at least 80 Yazidis after they refused to convert to Islam, it has been claimed.

The insurgents allegedly stormed into the small village of Kojo in northern Iraq, where they spent five days trying to persuade villagers to take up their religion.

When they refused, the male members of the ancient sect were reportedly rounded up and shot dead, while more than 100 women and girls were kidnapped.

Terrified: Islamic State militants have 'massacred' at least 80 Yazidis after they refused to convert to Islam, it has been claimed. Above, displaced Yazidis shelter are seen at a park near the Turkey-Iraq border yesterday

'They arrived in vehicles and they 
started their killing this afternoon,' senior Kurdish official Hoshiyar 
Zebari told Reuters yesterday. 'We believe it's because of their creed: convert or
 be killed.'

The women and girls abducted from the village, situated around 12 miles south of Sinjar, were being taken to the ISIS-controlled cities of Mosul and Tal Afar, the official said.

It comes as the Islamic State's continued push to the border with the Kurdish region has sparked a series of U.S. airstrikes and sent tens of thousands of Yazidis and Christians fleeing for their lives.

Yesterday, Yazidi parliamentarian Mahama Khalil said the alleged massacre had taken place during a one-hour period.

Meanwhile, the resident of a nearby village claimed to have been told details of the bloodshed by an Islamic State fighter.

'He told me that the Islamic State 
had spent five days trying to persuade villagers to convert to Islam and
 that a long lecture was delivered about the subject today,' said the 
villager.

'He then said the men were gathered 
and shot dead. The women and girls were probably taken to Tal Afar 
because that is where the foreign fighters are.' 

However, the account could not be independently confirmed.

Islamic State militants have killed at least 500 members of Iraq's Yazidi ethnic minority during their offensive in the north, according to Iraq's human rights minister.

Panic: It comes as the Islamic State's continued push to the border with the Kurdish region has sparked a series of U.S. airstrikes and sent tens of thousands of Yazidis and Christians fleeing for their lives

Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said the Sunni militants had also buried some of their victims alive, including women and children. Some 300 women were kidnapped as slaves, he added.

Meanwhile, American military officials last night claimed airstrikes from drones destroyed two
 armed vehicles south of the Iraqi town of Sinjar.

In a statement, U.S. Central Command said Kurdish forces had 
reported that Islamic State militants were attacking civilians in the 
village of Kawju. 

Officials said remotely piloted aircraft identified and then followed an 
armed vehicle to a roadside area near Sanjar, before striking and destroying two vehicles in the area.

Sick: British jihadist Nasser Muthana posted this claim on his Twitter account saying that he and other Islamic State fighters had captured hundreds of Yazidi and were holding them hostage in Syria

Jihadist: Nasser Muthana is a 20-year-old former Cardiff schoolboy who featured prominently in the Islamic State's first professionally produced English language propaganda video

It comes just days after a British jihadist made sick claims on Twitter that Islamic State militants are holding hundreds of Iraqi women as slaves in Syria.

Former Cardiff schoolboy Nasser Muthana appeared to refer to reports that 300 women were snatched from the Yazidi community near Mount Sinjar, where ISIS cornered thousands of refugees in a ten-day siege.

The tweet also alluded to claims that the women were intended to be given to young jihadists as wives.

It read: 'I can confirm that we have hundreds of yazidi slave women now in Syria, how about that for news!'

Before: Former Cardiff schoolboy Nasser Muthana uploaded images with the stark warning: 'Army base buildings before and after, I'm getting good with these bombs'

When his claims were questioned by a known sympathiser, he sounded more sincere.

Da Masked Avenger asked him: 'In all seriousness. What's the truth of this matter?'

Muthana replied: 'I'm not lying.'

The message was posted on Wednesday, but has since been deleted and his claims cannot be independently verified.

Fears are now growing for the captured women amid claims they could be used to bear children to break up the Kurdish-speaking group's bloodline.

After: The young jihadist, who describes himself on Twitter as a 'soldier of the Islamic State', said last month the UK government should be 'afraid' of his bomb-making skills

The minority group is originally Aryan
 and has retained a fairer complexion, blonde hair and blue eyes by only
 marrying within the community.

But in a furious bid to convert all non-Muslims, ISIS jihadists have vowed to impregnate the hostages.

Addressing
 the kidnapping, Adnan Kochar, chairman of the Kurdish Cultural Centre 
in London, told MailOnline: 'The Kurds and Yazidis are originally 
Aryans.

'But because 
the Yazidis are such a closed community they have retained a fairer 
complexion, blonder hair and bluer eyes. They don't marry non-Yazidis.

'ISIS
 have taken around 300 women from Sinjar to give to jihadists to marry 
and make pregnant to have a Muslim child. If they can't kill all 
Yazidis, they will try to smash the blond bloodline.'

Threat: Nasser Muthana posted a message on Twitter last month warning that the UK government should be afraid of him returning to the country with his new bomb making skills

Find: Muthana claims to have found this prayer mat inside the army base. He says it offers devotion to the Prophet Mohammed's daughter and is therefore in breach of Islamic law as evidence of practicing idolatry

Muthana
 - who featured in a chilling ISIS recruitment video - has been a 
prolific user of social media in recent months, posting horrific 
pictures of mutilated Iraqi soldiers and other taunting claims about the
 Islamic State's uprising in Iraq.

He has previously warned that ISIS fighters would slaughter any Yazidi men they captured in northern Iraq and would enslave their women and children.

'Kuffar [non-believers] are afraid we 
will slaughter Yazidis, our deen [religious path] is clear we will kill 
their men, take their women and children as slaves insha Allah,' he posted on Twitter.

He also posted a message on Twitter warning that
 the UK government should be afraid of him returning to the country with
 his new bomb making skills.

Friends: Reyaad Khan (left), who is also from Cardiff, appeared alongside Muthana (right) in the ISIS propaganda video, urging other young Muslims in the West to join them in jihad

The 20-year-old's boast about the Yazidi 
women came just days after he uploaded before and after images of a 
military building being destroyed by one of homemade bombs.

They appeared on his new Twitter page under the username Abul Muthanna@abulmuthanna313 after deleting his previous profile last month.

He
 was reportedly unhappy with the high levels of attention it received 
following his appearance in the Islamic State's recruitment video.

Formerly
 a prospective medical student, Muthana was joined in Syria by his 
younger brother Aseel, 17, who has now spoken of his willingness to die 
fighting for ISIS.

The 
Muthana brothers, who grew up in Cardiff after their father moved there 
from Yemen as a teenager, are among hundreds of young men from Britain 
who have flown to Syria to join the rebels.

Their friend Reyaad Khan, 20, also from Cardiff, said he had 'fireworks' for the U.S. if they returned to fight in Iraq.

Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana are among the British jihadists fighting with ISIS in Iraq that are using social networking sites to lure young Muslim teenagers from the UK into joining the Islamic State fanatics.

The extremists, who boast of ‘slaughtering’ innocent Yazidis and ‘taking their women as slaves’, are advising 15-year-olds that they are ‘not too young’ to die fighting for Allah.

Asked by a British 18-year-old girl if she is too young to join, one of them replied: ‘I know sisters younger than you. I heard of maybe 16-year-olds being here from UK. You aren’t too young.’

Before they fled: Jihadists Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana (circled) hand out food to the needy in Cardiff last year. Both have been tweeting about their involvement with IS while on the front line

They are informing their British ‘brothers and sisters’ every day how to make their way to Iraq, claiming they are ‘ordered’ to defy their parents and fight jihad.

The British IS fighters, who refer to themselves as the ‘Baadiya Boys’ after their original base in Syria, include Khan and Muthana.

The former Catholic college students have been joined on the frontline by young Muslim men and women from across the UK, including a group of five friends from Portsmouth, two of whom have already been killed.
