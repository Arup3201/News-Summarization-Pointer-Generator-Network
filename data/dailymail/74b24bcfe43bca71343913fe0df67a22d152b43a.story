A movie-loving pensioner has brought the big screen to his home by building the world’s smallest cinema in his bedroom.

Reginald Harding, 73, has created a makeshift movie theatre with big screens, cinema seats and classic projectors.

The old-style cinema features red curtains which draw back when a film starts, just like at the flicks, and a classic projector shining onto the wall, complete with the clicking of the reel as it plays.

Silver screen dream: Pensioner Reginald Harding has built the world's smallest cinema in his bedroom

Mr Harding knocked a hole in a wall of his three-bedroom semi-detached home to make space for the huge professional projector and converted a spare bedroom to accommodate the four-seater cinema.

He also has another projector is in his living room to get the full movie effect as well as scores of large film reels adorning the walls of his home.

Mr Harding, 73, from Sheldon, Birmingham, said: 'I call it the minimum cinema because it is probably the smallest cinema in the world that uses all professional equipment.

'When I stand by the projector when it’s running and I am looking through the small port hole which is only five foot down to the screen it’s just like sitting in a full size projection room looking at the real thing.'

Mr Harding said: 'When I am looking through the small port hole, it's just like sitting in a full-size projection room looking at the real thing'

Lifelong passion: Mr Harding used to splice together old film reels, repair and maintain the machines when working in the cinemas years ago

Despite being in a tiny converted bedroom, the cinema boasts four original cinema seats he salvaged when a local cinema closed down, with the projector showing films to the scale they were originally screened to large audiences.

No tickets are needed when friends and fellow cinema enthusiasts come to see the historic equipment in action, which he picked up for a bargain when commercial cinemas closed.

One of the CineMechanica projectors was made disposable when cinemas switched to digital while the other is capable of playing DVDs.

'I was quite lucky to get these projectors - it takes me back to the 50s, 60s, and 70s. I’m up here quite a lot. I love it. If I could live up here 24/7 I would. I like cleaning the projector down,' he added.

Big fan: The pensioner bought his first projector, a model from the 1930s, around 25 years ago and has been crazy about film ever since

The pensioner bought his first projector, a model from the 1930s, around 25 years ago and has been crazy about film ever since.

He started working in the cinema industry when he finished school during the 1950s and converted his house when he retired from working as a projectionist.

Mr Harding added: 'I watch all types of film but one of my favourites is The Greatest Show on Earth from the 1950s. Apart from that every film is my favourite.'

Running and maintaining cinema projectors has been a huge part of Mr Harding’s life and he remembers a golden time before the all the projectors turned digital.

His passion for film even sees him splicing different parts of film together to create longer clips.

Mr Harding watches classic film and news clips on the 35mm projectors, the cheapest of which cost £250 eight years ago.

He used to splice together old film reels, repair and maintain the machines when working in the cinemas and has been hooked on films since he bought a toy projector when he was seven-years old.

And he has been glued to the screen since.

His long career in cinema started after the manager at his local Odeon cinema promised him a job as a ‘rewind boy’ when he left school at 15.

It entailed making the tea, maintaining projectors and being responsible for rewinding all the film reels after they were played.

After an Oscar winning performance, despite not being able to view rated films, he was promoted twice to the position of ‘second projectionist’.

He still visits the cinema as often as he can but says the advancements in technology have changed the industry beyond recognition.

'It used to take up to five men to get a single film on, now one person can do several at once,' he added.

'For the customer it’s changed for the best, you’ve got a good clear picture. From my point of view it has changed cinema for the worse. There’s just something about watching live mechanical cinema.'
