Helen Flanagan has spoken of her embarrassment after she narrowly avoided arrest when she walked out of a Boots store with £200 worth of products she hadn't paid for.

The 22-year-old star was stopped by a security guard as she attempted to leave the Brighton store, who then threatened to call the police.

However, Helen insisted the incident at the shop in Brighton, east Sussex, was a genuine mistake, and blamed it on her 'ditzy' personality.

'Mortifying': Helen Flanagan, seen here in London on Thursday, has spoken of her embarrassment after getting caught leaving Boots with £200 worth of products she hadn't paid for

'I was just being ditzy': Helen claimed she was banned from Boots for five years following the incident, but a spokesperson for the Brighton store (pictured) has denied the claims

In an interview on Alan Carr's Chatty Man, airing on Friday night, Helen explained: 'I was feeling hot and flustered. I walked out of the shop, I had enough.
Security said, "Excuse me". I looked down and there was about £200 
worth in my basket.

'I said, "Oh God, I am so sorry. I would not do this kind of thing". The security woman says, "Right, I’m going to have to ring the police". I said, "You are joking?"

'I told her it was an honest mistake and she was like, "That’s what they all say".'

Helen, who subsequently paid for the items, claims she was then told by the cashier that the police wouldn't be called, but that she would be banned from entering any Boots store in the UK for the next five years.

Popping out: Helen's admission came as she posed at a photocall launching her PETA ad in London on Thursday

Helen added: 'I suppose I did sound a bit of a chav because I used the F-word. It was 
really annoying. You can’t have the power to ban someone from Boots!

'I shop there all the time. She knew what I did for a job and she 
just stood there nodding. It was awful. It was absolutely 
mortifying. I thought, "They can’t arrest me, I will still go to Boots".
People do walk out without thinking. I suppose I am quite ditzy.'

A spokesperson for Boots said that Helen was mistaken about the ban, adding in a statement: 'There was no police involvement at the 
time and no legal repercussions have followed.

'We can confirm that the 
young lady was not banned from our stores and we have contacted her to 
clear up any confusion over the matter.'

The statement continued: 'Boots UK take incidences of shoplifting 
very seriously, however we are also aware that genuine mistakes do 
happen.

'We can confirm that there was an incident in one of our stores 
involving a young lady who subsequently paid for her items.'

Helen's admission came as she attended a photocall to launch her new PETA ad campaign in London on Thursday.

Wearing a revealing basque top and 
skintight jeans, Helen was more than happy to show off her famous curves
in the figure-hugging ensemble.

The young star finished off 
her look with a pair of vertiginous heels, and kept her make-up simple 
with a slick of mascara and lipgloss.

A
group of onlookers were seen looking bemused by Helen's outfit choice 
as she posed up next to a large cardboard print of her advert.

And even Helen appeared taken aback by the shot, looking at it nervously as she posed up for photographers.

Here!, with the slogan 'Exotic Skins Belong In The Jungle'.

Speaking
about her decision to star in the campaign, Helen said: 'Spring is the 
perfect time to clean the cruelty from our closets.

'I
know when people see PETA's video, they won't want anything to do with 
the exotic-skins industry and will join me in leaving wildlife out of 
their wardrobes.'
