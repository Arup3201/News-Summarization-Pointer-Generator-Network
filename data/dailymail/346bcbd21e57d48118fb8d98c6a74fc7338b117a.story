Its hills and winding country roads make it one of our most idyllic counties – but they also make it one of the most dangerous for new, young drivers.

Cumbria is the worst area in England for car accidents involving 17 to 19 year olds, research has revealed.

Almost one in six crashes there – 15.8 per cent – that result in someone being hurt involve a teenage driver. Second is Cornwall, at 15.5 per cent.

Cumbria is the worst area in England for car accidents involving 17 to 19-year-olds, research has revealed

The only places in the UK more dangerous for recently qualified motorists are both in Wales – Dyfed-Powys, where 18.2 per cent of crashes involve a 17- to 19-year-old driver, and Gwent (17 per cent) – according to a report commissioned by the RAC Foundation.

Overall almost one in eight (11.9 per cent) of all road casualties are hurt or killed in collisions involving a car driver aged 17 to 19.

This is despite this age group making up only 1.5 per cent of licensed drivers.

The proportion of casualties involving drivers aged 17-19 was highest in the Dyfed Powys area of Wales at almost one in five (18.2 per cent).

This was followed by Gwent in Wales (17 per cent), Cumbria and North Wales (15.8 per cent), the northern and Grampian regions (15.7 per cent) and Cornwall (15.5 per cent). London had the smallest proportion (5.6 per cent).

Covering the five years from 2008 to 2012, the survey work was commissioned by the RAC Foundation and carried out by transport research laboratory TRL.

TRL also made a conservative estimate of what the reduction in casualties would be in each area if a system of graduated driving licensing (GDL) was introduced.

Among other possible requirements (like a minimum learner period and lower alcohol limit for new drivers), GDL schemes typically place temporary restrictions on newly-qualified young drivers in the first few months after they pass their tests.

These restrictions can include a limit on the number of young passengers they can carry and a late-night curfew. The aim of GDL is to limit young drivers' exposure to risk until they have gained experience.

Based on the experience of other countries where GDL is in operation, TRL concluded that across Britain about 4,500 fewer people would be hurt in an average year. This includes about 430 people who would otherwise have been killed or seriously injured.

The RAC Foundation said that currently one in five young drivers will have an accident within six months of passing their test.

Novice young drivers are at particular risk because of both their lack of experience (which affects new drivers of all ages to some degree) and the biological and behavioural characteristics of youth.

RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘Whichever way you cut it young drivers pose a significant and disproportionate risk to themselves and to others and it is in rural areas where the casualty rate is highest.

‘The Government has repeatedly delayed announcing its strategy to help reduce young driver accidents but here is yet another piece of evidence which shows graduated licensing can significantly cut death and injury.’

He went on: ‘The frustration is that while ministers here prevaricate, action is being taken just across the Irish Sea. Earlier this month a bill was put before the Northern Ireland Assembly which proposes the introduction of many of the measures this Government appears to have ruled out.

‘We should all have an interest in preserving young drivers' lives rather than exposing them to undue risk at the stage of their driving careers where they are most vulnerable. This is about ensuring their long-term safety and mobility. Not curtailing it.’
