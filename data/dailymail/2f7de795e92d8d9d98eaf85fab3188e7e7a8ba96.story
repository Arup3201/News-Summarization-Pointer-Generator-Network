The 
unfortunate ‘monkey’ joke is the latest in a series of race rows to 
blight English football. Most famously, John Terry lost the captaincy of
the national team in the furore over his alleged racial abuse of Anton 
Ferdinand.

His case, which 
dominated headlines for months, came less than a year after Liverpool’s 
Luis Suarez was banned for eight games for a racial offence.

But
aside from these high-profile cases, race has become a hugely sensitive
issue around the game.

blight English football

Such is the paranoia over causing racial offence
that even the most innocuous remarks can prompt a rapid public 
retraction.

Only this week ITV’s football 
anchorman Adrian Chiles was forced to apologise for comments made about 
Polish builders ahead of the World Cup qualifier between England and 
Poland.

Chiles said: ‘It’s practically a home game for Poland – 15,000 
Poles will be here, I’m sure.’

When
fellow pundit Lee Dixon responded: ‘Hopefully, they’re all crying at 
the end’ Chiles added: ‘I’m trying to get some building work done at the
moment, quite seriously. Be careful.’

Despite
widespread support on Twitter, Chiles, whose mother is Croatian, was 
made to apologise, saying: ‘I made the remark in relation to the nice 
Polish builders currently working at my place, who I knew would already 
be fed up having watched their team lose to Ukraine.

‘No
offence was intended – apart from anything else I could hardly be 
prouder of my East European background.

'But to anyone who thought what I
said constituted some kind of lazy stereotyping, and was offended by 
it, I certainly apologise.’ 

Chelsea
captain Terry was banned for four matches by the Football Association 
in September 2012 and fined a record £220,000 for using racist language 
against Queens Park Rangers player Ferdinand during a match at Loftus 
Road in October of the previous year.

Two
months earlier Terry had been cleared of a racially aggravated public 
order offence at Westminster Magistrates Court, but the FA brought 
disciplinary charges under its own rules.

The
fine – for the words ‘f****** black ****’ – was the highest ever levied
on an individual by the FA, and corresponded to Terry’s weekly wage at 
Chelsea.

In December 2011, 
Suarez was also found guilty of racial abuse.

He was handed an 
eight-match ban and fined £40,000 after clashing with Manchester 
United’s Patrice Evra during a game at Anfield two months earlier.

But
football has come a long way from the Seventies, when monkey chants 
followed the first black soccer players whenever they touched the ball.

In
August it emerged that every senior player in the Premier league and 
Football League must attend a session this season to receive guidance on
racist and homophobic language.

The Professional Footballers’ 
Association, is organising the sessions.
