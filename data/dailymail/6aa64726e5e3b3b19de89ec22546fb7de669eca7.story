A high school soccer coach 'aided' in a hazing attack on four young players that saw them sexually assaulted with a pole, an attorney for the alleged victims said.

The coach at La Puente High School in California, U.S., who has not been identified, helped to lure the boys - aged between 14 and 15 - into an athletic storage room where they were 'jumped' by four older soccer players and penetrated with a 'javelin-like pole', according to attorney Brian Claypool.

While the soccer coach - who has been placed on administrative leave - did not participate in the alleged assault, 'he knew', said Mr Claypool, who is representing three of the alleged victims.

Mr Claypool said the coach told the young players to go into the storage room at the school in Los Angeles, according to an LA Times report.

'Once inside, four big players pushed them down from behind. My guys fought like crazy,' he said.

The attorney said that one of the alleged victims, upon being released from the storage room, claimed to have seen the coach wink at the senior player that attacked him.

'He is at least guilty of aiding in a sexual assault,' Mr Claypool said.

Four La Puente students were arrested in connection with the alleged assaults, which are suspected to have been part of a hazing ritual for new players on the school's Warriors varsity soccer team.

Sheriff's officials said they are investigating the coach in connection with the victims' allegations at a press conference on Monday.

Angry parents staged a protest outside the school yesterday as details of the assault - alleged to have occurred in May - emerged.

The mother of one of the alleged victims, a 15-year-old boy, said she learned of the assault after another boy was hospitalised, adding that the incident was 'terrible' for the family.

Barbara Nakoaka, superintendent of Hacienda La Puente Unified School District, said the allegations were 'deeply disturbing' to the entire community.

'We do not and will not turn a blind eye to reports of harassment or hazing,' she said.

Officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said all the case was being reviewed by the district attorney's office.

The alleged attack at La Puente is the latest in a string of reports of dangerous and often violent hazing rituals at schools and colleges in the U.S.

In November last year 26-year-old drum major Robert Champion died after being beaten by fellow members of Florida A&M University's famed Marching 100 band.

Earlier this month eleven members of the women's volleyball team at SUNY Geneseo in New York were suspended after a freshman player was rushed to hospital with severe alcohol poisoning following a hazing ritual.

Police said the suspended players were all facing charges after forcing eight younger girls to drink shots of vodka while blindfolded and handcuffed.
