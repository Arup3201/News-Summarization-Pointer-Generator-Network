A pensioner has won a gardening competition from beyond the grave - after her daughter entered it on her behalf following her death.

Gena Skuse, 76, died in June but won her eleventh gold medal in the Bristol in Bloom gardening competition 13 days after she passed away.

Mrs Skuse's daughter, Dawn Tadghighi, entered her mother in secret to the competition which she had been competing since the 1990s.

John Skuse and Dawn Tadghighi stand in the garden in Bristol which Gena Skuse loved so much.

Mrs Skuse's daughter said that after her mother died the family 'were all just drawn to the garden to be close to her'

It
had been tradition for Mrs Skuse to enter the competition in secret and she would never tell her husband, John, 76, about her entries until 
she had won.

Mrs Tadghighi, 53, said: ‘She called it her little sanctuary and it really is beautiful.

'She worked so hard on it and she would love sitting out there next to the fountain having a cup of tea or coffee.

'Not that she would be able to sit for long - she would spot a weed or something and she would have to be up tidying it.

'When
she went into hospital and I asked her if she had entered this year she
couldn’t speak but she told me no. Just 13 days later she passed away.

'After she passed away and we came back to the house and we were all just drawn to the garden to be close to her and we were doing a bit of tidying.

'I looked around and I thought "Yeah, I’m going to enter her again this year" and I did - keeping up the tradition of keeping it a secret.

'When dad got the letter to say she had won it was amazing.

'I didn’t tell him because I didn’t 
want the pressure on him because he has found it hard going into her 
garden since she passed away.

'It is a tribute to her that she won again - a tribute to the hard work she put in to make a beautiful garden.'

Retired caterer Gena and former docks foreman John Skuse, childhood sweethearts, were married for 60 years before she passed away after a short illness.

Her
Bristol garden became a labour of love, and features a two-tier water 
feature and borders stuffed with ferns, purple larkspurs, white roses 
and pink peonies.

The 
back wall of the house is patterned with hanging baskets overflowing 
with daisies and pretty pink flowers, alongside a covered trellis 
archway which leads towards raised beds packed with peach and red 
pansies.

The garden has won Mrs Skuse her tenth gold medal in the Bristol in Bloom competition. She also has a silver medal.

Mr Skuse said: ‘The garden was something in common - besides my love for her.

'She actually adored the garden. We would come out with a cup of tea and sit at the table.

'She was very proud for people to look at it and say "what a lovely garden". She loved other people appreciating it.'

Eleven gold plaques and one silver are now displayed proudly in the garden.

Mike Crook, chairman of the Bristol in Bloom Community Association, said: ‘It is a garden which has grown over the years but the quality has always increased.’
