Michael Erdolino has been charged with theft after allegedly setting up a fake youth baseball team

A man has been accused of creating a fake young baseball team and stealing thousands of dollars in registration fees from the families of the children who wanted to join.

Michael S Erdolino, from St Mary's County, Maryland, charged $500 registration fee per member.

The families expected that to cover the costs of uniforms, equipment and practices.

They were also told the money would pay for instructors and insurance, according to police.

However, St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office said the victims only received a few practices.

Mr Erdolino, 38, of no fixed address, is accused of setting up the 'fake' Southern Maryland Athletics Youth Baseball team last September.

He allegedly held several fundraisers to pay for the team in St Mary's County and Calvert County.

He was arrested and charged with theft on Thursday. 

Police said: 'Erdolino self-established an organization named Southern Maryland Athletics Youth Baseball and actively recruited children for his team which would be based in St. Mary's County.

'On February 7, 2013, Erdolino met with detectives and was unable to 
produce any documentation of the accounting for the alleged organization
he had created,' according to WUSA9.

He was arrested in Hollywood, Maryland, and charged with theft $1,000 - $10,000, Theft Scheme $1,000 - $10,000 and four counts of Theft under $1,000.

He has been released from on a $5,000 bond.
