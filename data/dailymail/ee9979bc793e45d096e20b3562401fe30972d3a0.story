She's been catapulted to a household name almost overnight and now girl of the moment Kate Upton is continuing to promote herself to the max.

The blonde beauty is gracing the cover of this year's Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit edition and she's continuing the promotional trail alongside last year's cover girl Irina Shayk.

The stunners took to Las Vegas on Wednesday night and posed together as they enjoyed a special night at Haze nightclub in the Aria Resort and casino.

Kate showed off the immaculate looks which landed her the cover in the first place, showing she looks just as good with her clothes on as she does in a bikini.

The 19-year-old wore a figure-hugging black strapless dress with a white hem skimming her cleavage.

And she finished the look off by wearing a pair of black Louboutin heels with the red spikes on full show.

Lapping it up: Kate was joined by model Nina Agdal, who also appears inside the new edition of the magazine

Wearing her light locks down the curvy model posed with the publication as she entered via the red carpet, before she worked the room at the Sports Illustrated On Location event.

And Irina showed she's still fully supporting her successor, as she stood by her side for a large portion of the night.

The 26-year-old Russian beauty wore a low-cut black playsuit which she dressed up with a snakeskin belt and black spiky heels.

And Kate also posed alongside brunette beauty Nina Agdal, who also appears in this year's swimsuit edition.

And she's obviously making the most of her new found fame and milking having herself on the cover as much as she can.

Kate remained coy when asked in an interview set to air on the Ellen DeGeneres show whether she was dating New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez.

'I did not have Valentine's Day date this year,' she replied when asked by the host.

She went on to admit Sanchez was 'cute' and adds: 'I've met him. My sister works for the Jets. And she's been working there for four years. So, I went to all the games... I met him briefly.'

It
was only on Tuesday, on Valentine's Day, that she attended the official
launch party in New York, where she was surrounded by a bevvy of 
beauties who are gracing the inside pages.

On that occasion the teenager turned up in scarlet red, while she was also flanked by Irina again, who opted for a white frock.

But
although Kate is the envy of men and women around the world thanks to 
her latest shoot, it appears she wasn't always the picture of 
perfection.

The bombshell 
reportedly let herself go last year and it took a friend to have words 
with her and urge her to look after her figure.

A source told the New York Post: 
'She’s not your typical model... She will eat anything. She’s not 
assuming. She’s not into herself. She’s not very affected.'

But
although she never deprives herself of food, Kate insists it is her 
hard work in the gym that is to thank for her stunning physique.

She said: 'I
have to give credit to my trainer. He definitely kept me motivated in 
staying in shape... I’ve always been naturally curvy, but of course I 
had to get used to being in the public eye'

And
she's certainly looking after herself now that she's well and truly in 
the public eye if her latest get-ups are anything to go by.
