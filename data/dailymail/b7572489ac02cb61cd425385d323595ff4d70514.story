Stephen Fry's fiancé was banned from driving today for speeding at 101mph after the QI presenter told his boyfriend to 'get a move on' as they rushed to a literary festival.

Elliott Spencer, 27, was driving an Aston Martin to Hay on Wye where Fry was due on stage in May.

A court heard they were running late due to Bank Holiday traffic when the star, 57, 'persuaded' his boyfriend to 'put his foot down'.

The speed of the Aston Martin, which had been loaned to the couple so they could test drive it, then shot up to 101mph in a 70mph zone.

Crashing to earth: A day after they announced their engagement, Stephen Fry's fiancé Elliott Spencer was banned from driving for going more than 100mph last May

Story: Elliott Spencer appeared at Cwmbran Magistrates' Court in South Wales supported by his partner today, who 'persuaded' him to speed because they were late for an event at the Hay-on-Wye Festival

Appearing at Cwmbran Magistrates' Court in South Wales this morning, 24 hours after the couple announced their engagement, Elliott pleaded guilty to a charge of speeding and was banned from driving for seven days, and fined a total of £205. 

Their barrister Mark Wyeth QC said: 'Mr Fry who is Spencer's partner was due as the new president of the Lterature Festival and was due that afternoon to give his inaugural address.

'They hit a large backlog of traffic and in a moment of indiscretion Mr Fry suggested to Spencer that he might like to get a move on.

'No other drivers were inconvenienced and he eventually did make it by a matter of a few minutes, in time for the festival.

'Mr Fry assumes all responsibility because it was his decision that made Spencer put his foot down.'

Fry, ‎dressed in a green corduroy jacket, checked shirt and pink tie, watched in court as his future husband was handed his punishment.

‎Spencer was told by the magistrates: 'Your partner persuaded you to increase your speed so you were not late for an engagement.'

After the hearing, the newly engaged couple were ushered out of the co‎urt building via a back entrance.

They then walked to Fry's £150,000 Bentley - which Spencer crashed yesterday in London - and left the small Welsh town.

Smiling Fry was in a jovial mood and signed autographs and posed for selfies inside the court building before the hearing.

And as the magistrates considered their decision he teased Spencer - telling him he was "probably facing a stretch in jail".

After the case he said the time since announcing their engagement has been "wonderful" and that they planned to tie the knot within the next year.

Speaking after the case Fry said: "It's been wonderful. We've not fixed a date and if I had I wouldn't tell you! But I can say it will be sometime within the next year or so.

"As is the way with these things it became public when we filled in the paperwork.

"It was probably a bit much to expect a quiet ceremony." 

Overjoyed: Stephen Fry and his new fiancé Elliott Spencer, 27 outside the star's London home yesterday

Official: Mr Fry, wore an engagement ring today, and said he and his partner have not set a date for their wedding

Tight turn: Yesterday Mr Spencer tried to manoeuvre Mr Fry's £150,000 Bentley out of a garage and scraped the side

Public record: This is the declaration to marry posted in the Registry Office in Dereham shortly before Christmas 

Nothing could wipe the smile from Stephen Fry's face as he emerged from his plush Piccadilly home yesterday with his husband-to-be Elliot Spencer - not even his fiance scratching his Bentley.

The 57-year-old QI star and his partner, 27, wore matching engagement rings as they announced the wedding is planned sometime this year.

Minutes earlier, Mr Spencer had tried to manoeuvre Mr Fry's prized Bentley Continental GT out of a tight garage and scraped the side.

Despite the damage to the £150,000 motor, Mr Fry simply shrugged it off with a smile, saying it was 'nothing', but was the one who took the steering wheel when the couple drove off.

Earlier Mr Spencer's parents spoke about the upcoming wedding, saying they are 'over the moon' after the star revealed he will marry their son, who is 30 years his junior.

Robert and Miranda Spencer, from Southampton, admitted they are delighted about the couple's decision to wed after their whirlwind romance.

The couple were first seen together last November, but the pair are understood to have become serious  over the summer.

Mr Spencer's parents have given them their blessing and Mr Fry said: 'I have met them and they are very nice'.   

The pair could been seen engagement rings on their wedding fingers and Mr Fry added: 'They are very similar, both are made of Rhodium and are almost matching.' 

Overjoyed: The actor said today he was 'very very happy' that he and his partner Elliott, together in September, will marry in the coming year

The engagement came less than three years after he tried to kill himself during an unhappy spell in his life where he struggled to cope with fame, loneliness and the break-up of his previous relationship.

Mr Fry, who suffers from bipolar disorder, revealed that in 2012 he tried to kill himself with a cocktail of vodka and pills, and was only saved by a producer who discovered him.

Friends have credited the young stand-up comic, who is 30 years Fry's junior, with putting a smile back on the actor's face following a crippling battle with depression.  

Friends have spoken of the joy that the young man has brought to Fry's life, with one telling The Sun: 'Since Stephen met Elliott, it is like he has a new lust for life.

'We've got the old Stephen back. He has found new hope in Elliott and they thrive off each other.' 

The 27-year-old writer and comedian is the son of a property developer, who is believed be a millionaire.

Robert Spencer set up Hood House Limited with a business partner and the firm has built a series of new homes in Hampshire, West Sussex and on the Isle of Wight.

He has just sold the last property at his new development - consisting of two, three and four bedroom homes - near Waterlooville, Hampshire.  

His son went to Park Gate Primary School which is just 300 yards away from their £500,000 home. 

Break: Over the summer Stephen and his husband-to-be spent time in Italy and met with actress Emma Thompson and her children in Florence

Official: The couple have announced their intention to marry by posting a formal notice to wed at Dereham Registry Office in Norfolk
