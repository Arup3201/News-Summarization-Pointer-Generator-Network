Parents of pupils at an all-girls' grammar school were given an unexpected surprise when they clicked on on a website associated with the school to find it plastered with raunchy images.

Families hoping for information to do with Highworth Grammar School, in Ashford, Kent, would have been left with something entirely different when clicking on highworthgrammar.co.uk, a web address formerly used by the establishment.

It is now adorned with six pictures of scantily-clad women - some topless - and links to webcam and sex chat sites.

They include a woman wearing nothing but knickers and stockings - and holding her breasts with her hands.

There were also x-rated 
adverts for casual sex, cam chats, and affairs, linking to other explicit sites.

Although the school changed its domain name three years ago, some parents have mistakenly followed to old link to be confronted by the explicit content.

The address has been bought up by an unknown company which filled the web page with the sexual images and links.

And although the school is now attempting to buy back the domain and remove the images, there is no guarantee they will be successful.

A school spokesman said: 'Parents were informed of the changes to the new name and clearly this was acted upon by the great majority of our parents.

'We also ensured that any links within the internet had been updated to the best of our ability.

'We have received very few contacts from parents about this problem when they have used a favourite bar or history link and they have been most understanding when we have explained what has occurred.

'Since there was a fair period of time between us moving to our new address and the old address being used to redirect to the adult site, we did not feel that raising general public awareness was warranted and for it to act as free advertising for such adult sites.

'Highworth Grammar School is obviously concerned about the use of the old internet address for such purposes and apologises for any offence to anyone who has inadvertently accessed to old site.

'The school's old address was maintained for a period of time after the switch over, redirecting browsers to the updated home page.

'But the school dropped its subscription, allowing others to purchase the domain. We are not in a position to purchase this address back until it next becomes available on the market and we are monitoring the availability.

'Clearly an address advertised and therefore receiving hits is less likely to be released for purchase by the current licence holder.'
