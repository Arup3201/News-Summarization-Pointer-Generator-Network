You can never have too much of a good thing.

And this certainly rings true for Florida couple Bernard and Janice Caffary who travelled on their 100th cruise - all taken on the same ship. 

Taking their first trip on the Carnival Sensation back in 2003, the pensioners fell in love with the vessel, and have now reached an impressive milestone.

The Caffarys took their first trip on board the Carnival Sensation back in 2003, and their love of the ship has not waned throughout the years

Carnival have confirmed that they are the most travelled couple on their cruise lines in the company's 43-year history.

There is obviously something special that keeps them coming back, and Mrs Caffary confirmed to USA Today what it was.

'It becomes friendly and warm and family, and it stays with you,' said Mrs Caffary. 

'We really do like the crew. It's a family atmosphere. A lot of the crew members call us "mom and 'dad."'

The coupe say the warmth of the staff and the food and entertainment are major factors that see them continue to book on the Sensation

There is a resort-style pool on deck on the Carnival Sensation, as well as waterslides to keep the thrill-seekers happy

The couple have sailed 42 times on other Carnival branded ships, and list Royal Caribbean and Norwegian among other cruises they have holidayed on.

Demonstrating their love for 'home comforts, the Caffarys try and book the same cabin on each journey, getting 90 per cent success with this.

The Carnival Sensation caters for 2,056 people and has around 920 on-board crew.

The cruise ship departs from Port Canaveral in Orlando, Florida twice a week to set sail to the Bahamas. Trip durations are between two and five days.

Features on board include three waterslides, a resort-style pool, and adult-only oasis Serenity, plus Spa Carnival.
