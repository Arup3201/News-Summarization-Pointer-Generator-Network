Two of the most powerful forces in the world, money and public opinion, have conspired to bring about the richest and most anticipated fight in boxing history.

The cash takes the form of the minimum $150million (£96m) which Floyd Mayweather is being guaranteed to fight Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2. 

The psychological pressure came to a head when the man who calls himself ‘Money’ was besieged by fans at an NBA game. Chanting: ‘We want Manny,’ they clamoured for him to face up to the Filipino congressman who is his only realistic challenger for the mythical title of greatest pound-for-pound boxer on earth.

Those two elements did more than anything to coax Mayweather out of his five-year hesitation about putting his cherished unbeaten record at its most serious risk yet as he approaches, at coming up 38 this week, the climax to a magnificent career.

These factors mattered more within the Mayweather psyche than all those protracted, convoluted negotiations.

Pacquiao's acceptance of the smaller share of the booty, the poor chap is only on $100m (£64m) plus bonuses for one night’s work in the MGM Grand Garden Arena, HBO and Showtime agreeing to share the US pay-per-view broadcast, each boxer wearing his favourite gloves, 'Money' having the honour of entering the ring second, the PacMan saying yes to Olympic standard drugs testing……all these issues and more were mere obstacles waiting to be hurdled by negotiation.

Egos, pecking orders and the settling of old scores had been the immovable barriers for so long that we had come to fear never seeing the two finest boxers of their generation in the same ring.

Incredibly, Mayweather and Pacquiao had never even been in the same room until they happened to spy each across the court at a subsequent basketball game.

Hallelujah, that chance meeting helped Mayweather gratify the control freak in his personality.

It was he who invited Pacquiao into conversation and thus he could rightly claim the credit for ending their stand-off.

But lest we forget, Pacquiao has always declared himself ready and willing and quickly made the concessions to prove it.

Still, a myriad of detail was still to be settled but all that really remained was for Mayweather to score a point against his old enemy, Pacquiao's veteran promoter Bob Arum, with whom he had vowed never to work again.

That he did by demanding the right to make the announcement that the fight is on.

His delays in so doing gave everyone the jitters but by then his arm had been well and truly twisted.

He will come to be grateful that it was because this fight will cement his considerable legacy in the hardest game – win, lose or draw.

Just in time, Mayweather is honouring the tradition of such Hall of Fame noblemen as Sugar Ray Leonard, Tommy Hearns, Marvin Hagler, Roberto Duran, Tito Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya – who fought each other without fear of defeat because they knew that only by doing so could they claim their seat in the pantheon.

You know he senses that importance when he says now: ‘This is my chance to prove myself T.B.E……the best ever.’

Yes, that ego is still in brash working order but more importantly he is doing the right thing by the sport which had made him phenomenally rich and controversially famous.

Miami Heat projected the two fighters onto the big screen and asked the question: 'Coming in 2015?'

Boxing is grateful, also, and never mind that hindsight may reveal that he played a clever game in delaying this inevitable fight until it became this gigantic financial bonanza.

The worldwide audience of millions will stretch way beyond the core enthusiasts for the hard old game, out across the spectrum of society to engage a new generation.

The calculating genius of Mayweather has kept him beyond defeat. Pacquiao the cavalier has exposed himself to the odd loss, while exciting the masses.

Thus there is the prospect of a classic battle of styles – Mayweather’s scientific technique, refined skills and mastery of the noble art of self defence against the southpaw fury, sustained aggression, knock-out power and non-stop punching of Pacquiao.

If that materialises, these two fighting men can transform boxing into a major sport overnight.

The instant stampede of enthusiasm suggests that is happening already.

The MGM sold out all its 5,005 rooms within 15 minutes of Mayweather firing the starting gun on line. The base room rate for the nights of May 1st and 2nd is upward of $500.

Accommodation is already hard find all over the Strip.

Tickets for ringside seats, expected face value $5,000 (£3,300), are already appearing on the black market at up to $20,000 (£13,000).

Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau last November

Showtime and HBO are preparing to charge a record $99.95 (£65) for a pay-per-view subscription. All the MGM properties will screen closed circuit transmission on giants screens, entrance fee $200 (£130) plus.

Millions in the Philippines will watch on giant screens in city squares and parks.

A bidding war is under way for TV rights in at least 200 countries outside the US, the UK included with Sky, BT, BoxNation and perhaps ITV in contention.

With the combined purse for Mayweather and Pacquiao totalling at least $250 million, projections for the value of the event are rising from an initial $300 million to close on half a billion.

If that comes to pass – and there are ten weeks of promotional hype and hysteria to come - the rewards for the combatants will increase.

This was an offer that Mr Money-bags could not refuse. Not that the world would let him.
