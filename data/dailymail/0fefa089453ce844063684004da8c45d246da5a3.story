Still striking: NUT's Christine Blower, pictured last year, warned that teachers strikes will go ahead

Teachers have agreed plans to strike over pay and pensions the day after Michael Gove wrote to unions insisting the issues were 'fixed'.

Both the Education Secretary and the teachers' unions have refused to back down from the stalemate.

At the National Union of Teachers annual conference, general secretary Christine Blower said: 'We are not rowing back... We have put these reasonable demands and we want to talk to him about them, not just have him send us a letter.'

Her comments in Liverpool yesterday came after Mr Gove wrote to unions saying he was willing to meet but the 'direction of travel' on key issues was 'fixed'.

The NUT and National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers last week announced rolling strikes from June 27, with a national walkout before Christmas.

Speaking at the NUT annual conference in Liverpool today, general secretary Christine Blower warned Mr Gove that the unions stand firm in their position.

This week, Mr Gove wrote to the NUT and the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) to say he was willing to meet the unions to discuss the issues, but insisting that the ‘direction of travel’ on both pensions and pay is ‘fixed’.

Ms Blower said: ‘Negotiation is about sitting across the table having an exchange and listening to people.

‘What he’s saying is pay and pensions are done and dusted, and there’s no reason to talk about it. That’s not our view.’

The unions put a list of demands to Mr Gove, calling on him to suspend the introduction of performance-related pay, due to be brought in later this year, and to publish an evaluation of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme.

They also wanted him to ‘commit to genuine engagement’ by setting up a series of meetings to discuss the dispute.

In his letter to the unions, Mr Gove said he would be ‘very happy’ to meet them, but he warned: ‘While I am happy to discuss any issue you have, I shall stress in advance that on changes to teachers’ pension and pay arrangements, the direction of travel is now fixed.

No change: Education Secretary Michael Gove told the NUT and NASUWT that the Government's plans for teachers' pensions and pay will go ahead

Collective action: The strike will begin in the North West in June with further walkouts to follow during the autumn term with a national strike in December

‘In both cases, there has been full consultation with trade unions including the NASUWT and the NUT.’

In her response to the letter, NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ‘This is a serious situation which requires a more measured response than this display of arrogance and belligerence from the Secretary of State.

‘As far as we are concerned we remain committed to engaging in genuine discussions and our original demands still remain on the table.’

Delegates at the NUT’s annual conference are expected to debate a priority motion today confirming the union’s plan for industrial action with the NASUWT.

Ms Blower said ‘While it is entirely possible for members to seek to amend the priority motion, the purpose of the motion is to go forward from conference with a ringing endorsement of the strategy with the NASUWT.’

She also rounded on Mr Gove for previously calling his critics ‘enemies of promise’.

‘I think people were astonished when Michael Gove used the expression ‘enemies of promise’.

‘It seemed to teachers whom I have talked to about it that he has no idea what goes on in schools up and down the country.

‘If you’ve ever been into a primary or secondary school on a normal working day, you will find teachers working extremely hard, even in the face of Government interventions, and children being taught incredibly interesting and exciting lessons.’
