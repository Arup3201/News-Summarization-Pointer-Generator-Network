Luis Suarez became frustrated at being asked questions about his World Cup bite scandal that he walked out of an interview... with the newspaper serialising his new autobiography.

The former Liverpool striker, who will make his Barcelona debut in Saturday evening’s El Clasico, was banned for three months for biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup in Brazil.

The Uruguayan cut short the interview with The Guardian after he claimed he was asked ‘38,000 times’ about the incident.

Suarez exited off the pitch he was being interviewed on with his agent, saying: ‘They asked me about the bite 38,000 times, never again.

‘This is the last one of these [interviews], I feel like taking off my microphone.’

The interview ended there, but all eyes will be on Suarez once again in Saturday’s clash at the Bernabeu.

About the Evra incident, Suarez had said: ‘I know I was wrong with the biting and the diving but I was accused of racism without any proof,’ Suarez said. ‘There were lots of cameras, but no evidence. It hurts me the most that it was my word against theirs.’

The then-Liverpool star was fined £40,000 and banned for eight games for the; but the three-month ban he received for the biting incident is nearly up.

‘Every culture has its way of expressing itself, and that’s a word people in Uruguay use all the time, whether somebody’s black or not black. It gets used a lot without those connotations, and that’s why it is completely different to how it is expressed in England, no?’

The 27-year-old insists it was never his intention to upset Evra, and has once again passed the term off as ‘something footballers say’.

‘I just said: “Why, negro?” and it was just like asking: “Why?” These are things that footballers say, that happen all the time.’

The autobiography, Crossing the Line, is released on November 6.
