Christian Benteke is set to make his comeback from injury against Manchester City with Paul Lambert insisting his striker will not be wrapped in cotton wool once he is out on the pitch.

But there has been a setback for fellow centre-forward Libor Kozak, who underwent surgery once more this week on his broken leg and could be out until the new year.

Benteke, 23, has not featured since the loss at Manchester United on March 29 after rupturing his Achilles in training five days later but is expected to be named among the substitutes at Villa Park on Saturday.

Lambert said he would make the final call on Friday if the Belgium international comes through training, after he had a successful 63 minutes for Villa’s Under-21s side on Monday.

But once Benteke is back amongst it, after six months out, the Villa manager wants his star player to perform. ‘We’re not going to wrap him in cotton wool. If he’s out there he’s got to go and do it,’ Lambert said.

‘The main thing for me was his legs, lung-wise, and that lack of games. He will get there. His injury was the most important thing and he’s recovered from that.’

Kozak meanwhile broke his leg in training in January and had looked on course to return to action at a similar time to his strike partner. 

But Lambert revealed the Czech Republic international, bought for £7million from Lazio last summer, had needed a further operation this Wednesday on his fracture to insert a supporting pin.

Kozak, 25, scored four goals in eight starts for Villa before his injury. ‘I haven’t spoke to the doctor about the length that he will be out but it’s going to be a while,’ said Lambert.

‘It’s a nightmare. I spoke to him about his injury and he felt a bit down which is understandable because he’s worked so hard to get back.

‘He wasn’t too far away from being back. He was running and doing everything. It’s a blow for him and blow for us. It’s just not healed the way we thought.

‘When he came his goal ratio was very good. He’s a handful. He’s just been unfortunate that he’s suffered that setback.’
