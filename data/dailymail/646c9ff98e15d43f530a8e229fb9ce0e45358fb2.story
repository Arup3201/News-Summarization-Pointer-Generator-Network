Nancy Stowe was one of the few female officers on the tough streets of Belmont, North Carolina, in the 1970s.

The 75-year-old grandmother has been retired for years, but she hasn't forgotten her skills and definitely hasn't lost her nerve.

Stowe was sitting in the car at a gas station in Glastonia on Thursday night when her 22-year-old grandson was robbed by two men.

They forced him to the ground and tried to steal his wallet, when his father, Doug Stowe, jumped out of the car and went to save his son, according to The Palm Beach Post.

Then and now: Nancy Stowe was one of the few female officers on the tough streets of Belmont, North Carolina, in the 1970s. Now 75, this week she proved she's still got it

Scene: Nancy Stowe's son and grandson were attacked at this gas station Thursday night in Gastonia

However the bandits, much younger than Mr Stowe, pummeled him too.

Thats when Nancy knew it was up to her.

As a cop she was taught to stand tall and speak with authority.

And so she did just that, getting out of the car and going straight up to the thugs.

'I didn’t have a weapon at all,' Nancy Stowe told The Palm Beach Post.

'I just got in between them.

I said, ''Oh, no you don’t''.

'I said, ''That’s enough of this''.'

Battered: Doug Stowe was beaten up when he tried to help his son, who was being robbed

Fearless: Nancy Stowe said she immediately knew what she had to do after witnessing the robbery

She had left her cellphone in the car, but raised her arm to make it seem as if it were in her hand.

She pointed to her hand and said she had called 911 and that the robbers should leave.

They then ran away.

As they took off, Stowe hollered: 'And don’t try it no more tonight!’

Her son and grandson are both bruised but are fine.

Police are hoping they will find the men using the surveilance footage from the gas station.

Stowe also worked with the county Sheriff’s Department and the Police Department in Coats, North Carolina.
