ITV came under fire from viewers today for screening an 'offensive' e-cigarette advert during I'm A Celebrity which appeared to show a woman talking about oral sex.

A woman in a black cocktail dress uttered a series of suggestive phrases in the 20-second commercial screened just after the watershed.

Advertising watchdogs have launched a full investigation into the advert after receiving a 'significant number' of complaints.

'Crude': The woman in the advert appears to be talking about oral sex in the advert screened on ITV just after the watershed last night

'Unfunny': A man in the advert who is asked to 'get it out' by the woman - in a reference to an e-cigarette

In the commercial, the woman said 'I want you to get it out' and 'I want you to put it in my mouth', in an apparent reference to a sex act.

She added: 'I want to see how great it tastes'.

However, in a twist at the end she makes clear that she is actually referring to an electronic cigarette.

Viewers branded the advert 'disgraceful' and unfunny while others said that it glamourised smoking.

The commercial screened at 9.10pm last night during I'm a Celebrity which this year stars Joey Essex from The Only Way is Essex and model Amy Willerton.

Louise Edwards Tweeted at ITV's official account that she thought the advert was inappropriate.

She wrote: 'I really object to VIP advert just shown on ITV talk about the wrong messages to young people watching I’m a celeb £disgraceful.'

Reece Doyle even accused the advert of promoting sex crimes. He said: 'I really do not like the VIP advert. There are obvious allusions to rape. Utterly disgraceful.'

Jodie Pullman added: 'The VIP Ecig advert is awful. Needs removing off TV that does.'

A teenager wrote that it was 'awkward' to watch the advert nextr to his parents.

The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) confirmed they were investigating the advert for VIP Electronic Cigarettes.

A spokesman said: 'The ASA has received a significant number of complaints about two TV ads for VIP electronic cigarettes.

'One ad shows a woman, and the other a man, both speaking directly to the camera.

'Complainants object that the language used in the ads is overly sexual and offensive while others object that the ad sexualises and glamorises e-cigarettes and/or smoking.

'We have now launched a formal investigation into these ads.'

Makers of the e-cigarette said they had created the commercial in response to an EU ban on actually showing their product on-screen.

Offensive: The makers of the e-cigarettes defended their advert which they described as 'tongue in cheek'

Miguel Corral, co-owner of VIP Electronic Cigarettes, defended the ‘tongue-in-cheek’ advert.

He said: 'I think it’s safe to say that our ads could be considered controversial and definitely push boundaries.

'Due to advertising regulations we were not permitted to include the product in the ad, so we decided to take a tongue-in-cheek approach to appeal to an adult audience and communicate the superior taste of VIP products, whilst making it clear that the product does contain nicotine and that they are only available to smokers over the age of 18.

'We anticipated that the creative treatment for this campaign would cause comment and we were ready for this, but I want to make it very clear that as a leading e-cigarette manufacturer we take our responsibilities extremely seriously which is evident in our decision not to broadcast the ads before the watershed and follow the advertising rules closely.'
