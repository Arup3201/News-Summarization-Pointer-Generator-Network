Wooden boats loaded with tourists cause a massive traffic jam at Thailand's famous Damnoen Saduak Floating Market, a historic collection of vendors that has become completely over-run by tourists.

Located in the Ratchaburi province, about 100 km west of Bangkok, this traditional floating market primarily functions now as a tourist attraction - in fact were it not for the visitors on water market tours the ancient tradition may not be able to stay afloat.

The practice is steeped in history, however, as these markets were originally the only way that fruits and vegetables were sold in many places in the Thai kingdom.

Originally, the canal was dredged to connect the Taachin River and the Maklong River, during a time when transportation was almost motionless.

Today, many people live along both sides of the canal - the majority of whom are farmers who grow oranges, grapes, papayas, cabbages and onions.

There are countless  floating markets throughout the country, though this one is particularly noteworthy for its colourfully-clad merchants and congested canals.

Bargaining is common practice as individuals selling souvenirs and food paddle along the water in sturdy canoes, but prices are often only negotiable by a few baht.

To beat the crowds, experts suggest visiting in the early morning. Between 8 and 11 am, the market quickly fills up with hundreds of vendors and tourists.

Tours of the market are also available, with some even including a stop at the Phra Pathom Chedi in nearby Nakorn Pathom, which is believed to be the largest pagoda in Southeast Asia.

To see all floating markets in one fell swoop, boats can be hired to take tourists to Ton Khem, Hai Kui and Khun Phithal for about 300 baht per hour.
