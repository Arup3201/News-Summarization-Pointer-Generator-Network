One of the two owners of a Quebec retirement home where a fire killed as many as 32 people has finally broken his silence.

Roch Bernier, co-owner of Residence du Havre, in L’Isle-Verte, spoke Sunday at a mass dedicated to the victims of last week’s inferno that burned the facility to the ground.

More than 1,000 people attended the mass while search operations continue amid staggeringly cold temperatures, stiff wind and blowing snow, only 10 bodies have so far been recovered.

‘Inside each individual here in the church, there is enormous pain,’ he told reeling locals, according to CPTV. ‘We will have very difficult moments, but we will live them together.’

'We call them our residents, but we can go further than that: they are part of our family,' Mr Roche continued. 'I have to tell you that it has been very hard for us deal with all of this.'

He received a standing ovation from the majority of the town's 1,500 residents in attendance. Co-owner Irene Plante joined him, but did not speak.

In a statement to the media, Mr Roche said 'The Residence du Havre was not a little castle of cards -- there was a lot inside. There was an extraordinary spirit. If everyone helps out, maybe we will be able to relive that passionate spirit.'

He did not take any questions.

Parish priest Gilles Frigon struggled to find words, almost breaking down at times, according to CPTV.

'It's through suffering that we recognize true love,' he said, his voice cracking. 'Lord, we are all assembled feeling the same pain in this profound suffering that breaks our hearts. Today, we really need you.'

Quebec Premier Pauline Marois also attended the mass, she called the blaze 'unacceptable' and said authorities will begin the task of reviewing fire codes to see what further precautions can be taken to prevent an incident like this in the future, according to CPTV.

The search for victims is still ongoing, and as many as 32 are missing and feared dead from the Thursday fire.

It has been hampered by a combination of brutal weather and thick ice as deep as two feet that encased the smoldering remains of the structure after water used to battle the blaze froze in sub-zero temperatures.

Rescuers have been using steam to melt the thick ice in an effort to find more remains, but the search effort was called off Sunday afternoon as the weather worsened.

The grim search operation resumed Monday as temperatures approached the freezing mark, but the reprieve is only short-lived. Temperatures are expected to plunge back into the single digits for the next two days.

The coroner’s office has only formally identified three victims, with the most recent being 89-year-old Louis-Phillippe Roy.

Media reports have speculated the fire began in the room of a smoking resident, but fire officials have said that is one of several theories being considered.

The majority of the home’s 52 residents – all but five – were said to be infirm, and bound to wheelchairs or walkers. Some also suffered from Alzheimers.

Emergency responders were able to rescue 20 of the residents in a newer wing protected by a fireproof wall, the rest were doomed by inadequate sprinklers and malfunctioning smoke detectors, according to reports.

Survivors have been moved to other nursing homes in surrounding towns, and the Red Cross has raised around $180,000 to help replace the scorched belongings.

The fire was made increasingly tragic by the fact the small town’s volunteer firefighters had many relatives in the home – some watched in horror as relatives burn to death.

The local fire chief referred to the blaze as ‘a night in hell.’
