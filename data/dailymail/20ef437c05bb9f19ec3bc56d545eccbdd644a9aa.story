San Diego’s troubled mayor is in more hot water as his former director of communications brings further allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against him.

Irene McCormack Jackson filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging that Mayor Bob Filner sexually harassed her, put her in a headlock on multiple occasions, dragging her 'around like a rag doll,' and said ‘crude and disgusting’ things to her.

The lawsuit, seeking unspecified damages, was filed in San Diego County Superior Court by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred on behalf of Jackson, 57, a former journalist and employee of the San Diego Port District.

Allred said Filner had repeatedly asked Jackson when they could have sex and asked her on several occasions to ‘come to work without panties.’

Jackson, who now works in a different position at San Diego’s City Hall, is the first alleged victim of Filner to make her accusations against Filner publicly.

Jackson and Allred called on the 70-year-old mayor to resign.

‘A man who lacks character makes a mockery of his ideas,’ Jackson said at a news conference Monday evening.

Allred said Filner needs to stop ‘treating women as pieces of meat,’ adding that his video apology was inadequate and that his statement that ‘I need help’ is not enough.

‘Do you need help to know that making vile and disgusting sexual comments is wrong,’ Allred said.

Allred also announced that the council is undertaking investigations into Filner's use of a credit card during a trip to Paris, his dealings with a land developer, and his absence during a key vote about the city's pension plan.

Jackson, who became the Democratic 
mayor's director of communications because she said she ‘believed in 
him’ at the time, did not take questions during or after the press 
conference.

Within the past few weeks, a growing number of details have emerged about how Filner reportedly kissed constituents and groped female staffers.

The San Diego mayor released a cryptic video two weeks ago apologizing for ‘inappropriate’ behavior towards women in his office but refused to resign, saying that he planned to get help.

His refusal to leave his post as the city's first Democratic mayor in two decades has prompted some of his closest allies to come forward and reveal more about his alleged inappropriateness.

The women in his office became so used to his advances that they coined the names 'the Filner headlock' and 'the Filner dance' for the times when he would corner women and make sexual advancements.

In front of it: San Diego Mayor Bob Filner released a statement apologizing for his mistreatment of women that he worked with, and did so before any of the women came forward to rehash specific details

On top of that, his former fiancée 
released a statement saying that his behavior became 'more aggressive, 
standard decorum seemed to disappear' and played a major role in her 
decision to end the engagement a week before he released his video 
apology.

'Bob recently began texting other 
women sexually explicit messages and setting up dates while in my 
presence and within my line of vision,' his ex Bronwyn Ingram told local
station KPBS.

'I have 
witnessed a severe deterioration in Bob's ability to engage with anyone 
in a civil manner, myself included. During our trip to Paris, he 
screamed at me in public without provocation, among other inappropriate 
and disrespectful acts.

'Anyone
embroiled in so many serious controversies is impaired in ability to 
run a city. The mayor's office is now paralyzed, engaging only in 
defensive posturing and struggling to survive.

'I therefore urge Bob to put the best interest of the people of San Diego first and submit his resignation.'

Filner's fiancee Bronwyn Ingram (L) walked out on him just days before he released an apologetic video, and later made her own statement bashing his behavior

Aside from his ex-fiancée, none 
of the women who allege that Filner harassed them have come forward, 
choosing instead to talk through lawyer Marco Gonzalez.

He
told The Los Angeles Times that the mayor would allegedly begin by 
making lewd comments to the women in question, and continue to ramp up 
their interactions by cornering them and then forcibly kissing them.

In some cases, he would grab the breast or butt of female staffers.

While no charges have been filed, the attorney floated the possibility that they will file lawsuits against the 70-year-old.

'This
mayor cannot control himself... He does not deserve to be the mayor of 
this city any longer,' Gonzalez said at a press conference outside of 
City Hall.

Bob Filner became San Diego's first mayor in 20 years from the Democratic Party when he assumed office in 2012, coming off of a 20-year career in the U.S. Congress

The continued calls by Gonzalez as well as friends and longtime political allies, have not changed Filner's stance, however.

'I’m
not going to resign, and here’s why: as your elected mayor, I fully 
expect to be accountable to the citizens of San Diego for all of my 
actions,' he said at a press conference.

'But
as a citizen of this country, I also expect -- and am entitled to-- due
process, and the opportunity to respond in a fair and impartial venue 
to specific allegations.  

'I do not believe I am guilty of sexual harassment, and I believe a full presentation of the facts will vindicate me.'

Former City Councilwoman Donna Frye said of one alleged victim that Filner 'grabbed her [and] kissed her, jamming his tongue down her throat.'
