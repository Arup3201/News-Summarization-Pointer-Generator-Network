Jailed: Graham Burgess, 46, who tried to hire a hitman to kill his partner of 20 years in a bid to collect on his life insurance policy

A debt-ridden lorry driver hired a hitman to kill his partner of 20 years so he could pocket her £215,000 life insurance.

However he was caught after the man he believed would do the job was revealed to be an undercover police officer.

During one of four video-taped meetings, 46-year-old Graham Burgess said he wanted the mother-of-two run over and killed as she crossed a road outside her work.

He told the man ‘I need my missus dead’, adding: ‘If I had the balls, I would do it myself.’

He hoped that police would conclude that Alison Trigg, 45, had been the victim of a hit and run motorist.

Burgess was jailed for six years after a judge heard he had agreed to pay the officer £10,000 to carry out the task. He admitted soliciting a person to murder.

Stafford Crown Court also heard that Burgess – who had run up £112,000 of debt – planned to move his mistress into their home in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, and that he had been bragging in the pub about plans to kill Miss Trigg.

Judge Paul Glenn told him: ‘The callousness of your actions beggars belief. It must have been a terrible shock for Miss Trigg to find out your plans and the emotional effect on the lady must have been enormous.’ 

The method by which Burgess was put in touch with the police officer, identified only as 'J' in court, was not made public, although the Daily Mail understands he had admitted contacting another potential hitman, who had got cold feet, before meeting the police officer.

The court heard he had also been heard bragging in a pub about wanting to kill his partner.

Police also discovered that in the months before his contact with the hitman, the lorry driver had maximised life insurance policies for his partner to ensure that her death would see him receive a substantial payout – and had urged the officer to kill Miss Trigg before she paid the £3,000 fee for a university course she had committed to.

But he was arrested after his plan backfired and police officers approached Miss Trigg on the morning she was supposed to be killed and took her to safety.

Prosecutor Robert Price told the court the defendant and victim had lived together for most of their 20 years as an item.

He added: ‘The defendant was a lorry driver who was leading a double life. He had amassed very large debts and kept them hidden from his partner.

‘By November he owed £112,000, he had even taken out a second mortgage on their home without Miss Trigg knowing.

‘The bailiffs started knocking and Miss Trigg told Mr Burgess she couldn’t live with him with all of the financial pressure hanging over him.

‘She also started to suspect he was having an affair.

‘Out of the blue, in October, the defendant told his partner that he had made inquiries about a joint life insurance policy.

‘The defendant said his mum’s death had caused him to make the inquiries. The policy meant that Mr Burgess would receive £215,000 in the event of his partner’s death.’

Mr Price said J then contacted Burgess on November 7 and Burgess provided the officer with a £500 deposit.

A source told the Daily Mail: ‘Burgess told J to give him a missed call once the murder was done, so he could order some computers in his wife’s name, knowing full well that she wouldn’t be around to pay for them.’

Defending Burgess, Sailesh Mehta said the majority of Burgess’s debts were from second mortgage and a £5,000 credit card.

After the hearing, Detective Superintendent Dave Mellor, from Staffordshire Police, said Burgess had spent considerable time thinking about how he could dispose of his partner.’
