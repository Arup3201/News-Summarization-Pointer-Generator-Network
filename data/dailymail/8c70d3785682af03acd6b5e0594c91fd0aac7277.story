A boy who developed anorexia after being bullied as a teenager has overcome his eating disorder to become a personal trainer and model.

At his lowest weight last year, Carl Creasey, 22, from Rainham, Essex, weighed just 5st 5Ib. He would closely monitor what he ate, measuring out tiny portions, and then exercise as much as he could to burn off calories.

He would also avoid mealtimes in an attempt to conceal his problem from family and friends.

Buffed up:  Carl once weighed 5st 5lb, left,  but now he has a six pack after beating anorexia

He said: 'I use to do whatever I could to avoid food and sometimes avoided coming home just not to eat. I was addicted to the scales and if I wasn't losing weight I would increase my exercise. Sometimes I would go through the day with just a banana and cereal bar.

'I was obsessed with weight and measuring my food. I would eat the same things everyday as my body felt comfortable consuming these foods.'

Carl explained how his anorexia started after he was bullied at school and he 'saw food as the 
only thing that I could control.'

Transformation: He was once bullied at school and skipped meals to gain some control over his life but now has the confidence to model

In October 2012, he spent a month in a rehabilitation centre for people with eating disorders after doctors were concerned at how skinny he had become and feared his could only have months to live.

The stay helped him change his attitudes towards food and set him on the road to recovery. He then became interested in bodybuilding after seeing how a friend had transformed their physique after taking up the sport.

He realised if he wanted to get a buff body, he would have to eat more - to give his body fuel to work out and protein to build muscle and aid his recovery from exercise.

He said: 'I knew things had to change and I 
had always admired the bodybuilding physique. I knew if I was to get 
that kind of body then I would need to eat and supplement properly so I 
started going to the gym. I took it easy at first and built my way up 
learning and taking advice from friends and other gym goers.

Changed man: Carl now knows the importance of a healthy diet to give him a lean, toned body

'I was doing a lot of exercise when I 
was ill whereas now I know the importance of resting and eating properly
 to let the body recover and grow.'

Carl's self-esteem grew as well as his muscle tone and he decided to make a career out of his new hobby by qualifying to be a personal trainer.

He loves being able to help other people get the physiques they want through a balanced diet and sensible exercise.

He said: 'I now help and encourage others to beat their eating disorder as skipping meals is not the way forward.'

He now weighs 10st and said his confidence is 'sky high' - so much so that he has taken up modelling for brands including his sponsor, LA Muscle, and his new goal is to compete in fitness competitions.
