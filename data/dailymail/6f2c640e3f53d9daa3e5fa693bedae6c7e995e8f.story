Two mothers driven to distraction by their teething babies have invented a device they believe will make life easier for new mothers everywhere.

The Neckerchew not only catches dribble but also helps to soothe the gums of teething infants thanks to a chewable triangular portion at the bottom of a scarf worn around the baby's neck.

The brainchild of friends Julie Wilson and Amy Livingstone, the multi-purpose neckerchief cannot be dropped on the ground - saving parents the hassle of constant sanitising.

More than 1,000 have been sold in a matter of weeks and the pair, who met at an antenatal class in 2011 prior to birth of their first children, have heard from a number of global firms.

Innovative: The Neckerchew, which combines a bib with a teether, has proved popular with parents

Specially made: The teether at the end of the bib is made from a material designed not to annoy tender gums

The success is a world away from the birth of the design, which came about when the two mums chatted about their struggles with the tricky problem of dribbling, teething babies.

The 'mumpreneurs' seemed to spend much of their time cleaning dropped teethers. Both were keen to find a solution.

Julie, 48, who lives in the Morningside area of Edinburgh with estate agent husband Graeme and their 21-month-old daughter, Grace, said: 'When children start to teethe, they dribble a lot and they want to chew everything they can get their hands on.

'All any of us seemed to do was pick up and re-sanitise teethers, and we felt there had to be an easier way. That's when we thought "well, what if the teether was somehow attached to the baby?"'

Sure that they had spotted a gap in the market, the pair spent the next nine months doing market research.

Amy, 35, who lives in Roslin, Midlothian, with husband Alastair, who works for the government, and their 20-month-old son, Dawson, said: 'We started to look into what kind of fabrics would be best and found one that is gentle enough for a baby but also absorbent enough to make sure dribble doesn't soak through.

'For the teething part, we found a material that is safe for babies to chew on, and that wouldn't peel or flake.'

Popular: Julie and Amy have sold 1,100 Neckerchews since February and the device is in demand globally

Amy, who is expecting a second child in June and is using her maternity leave to devote more time to the business, and Julie, an innovation manager at Scottish Enterprise, decided they wanted to keep their budding business in Scotland.

Julie said: 'We found a company based in Glasgow called Tot Bots who put together a great prototype, so we're happy to be working with them.'

Since the product launched in February, the pair have been astonished by its success.

Julie said: 'We've sold over 1,100 already, double our projections for the first year. The feedback has been phenomenal. It's such a simple idea, but people have really responded fantastically to it.'

More than 20 independent stockists and four national retailers including JoJo Maman Bebe are set to have the Neckerchews on the shelves by summer.

Amy said: 'We've also had interest from distributors in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Japan, Ireland and Australia, so soon they could be taking over the world.'

Millionaire businessman Sir Tom Farmer, founder of Kwik-Fit, hailed the 'simple solution' and said he was 'very pleased' to hear of Julie and Amy's success.

He added: 'It's wonderful that these two ladies have been inspired to overcome this problem by creating a product that will not only serve them well, but will also be of a benefit to plenty of other parents. Often simple solutions make the best ideas. I wish them the best of luck.'
