But a new study suggests that people who believe they have a guardian angel (illustrated) take fewer risks and live less adventurous lives

You might think that people who believe they have an all-powerful protective spirit watching over them would take lots of risks.

But a new study suggests that those who think they have a guardian angel take fewer risks and live less adventurous lives.

The finding is the opposite of what researchers expected.

David Etkin, Professor of Disaster and Emergency Management at York University, Canada, examined the link between belief and risk-taking behaviour.

‘We hypothesised that a belief in guardian spirits would tend to be associated with a decreased risk perception and therefore an increase in risk-taking behaviour.

‘However, we found that instead of this belief making people able to take more risks because they feel protected, the results clearly indicated that those who believe in guardian angels are more likely to be risk-averse.

Professor Etkin and his team interviewed 198 people for the study. 

They noted how interviewees viewed risk, what sort of risky behaviour they participated in and why they chose to do so.

They found that 68 per cent of participants who indicated a belief in guardian spirits said it affects how they take risks, with a clear majority indicating that they are more risk-averse than non-believers, according to the paper published in the journal SAGE open.

For example, volunteers were asked to rate breaking the speed limit by 13 mph (20kph) on a scale of one to five in terms of risk and believers rated it riskier than non-believers.

‘It appears that the dominant cause-and-effect relationship is opposite to the one we originally hypothesised,’ Professor Etkin said.

‘We think that those who are more risk-averse use belief in guardian spirits as a coping mechanism to deal with their fear and anxiety over perceived risks in their environment.’

Nearly a third of Britons - 29 per cent - believe that a guardian angel is always watching over them, according to research published in 2010.

A slightly higher number - 31 per cent - admitted they believe in angels, while one in 20 said they have actually seen or heard one. Just 17 per cent said they are not sure what to believe.

London had the highest levels of believers at 40 per cent, according to the survey by the Bible Society and Christian Research. The North East scored the lowest, at 17 per cent.

People in the capital also scored the highest for believing a guardian angel watches over them, at 37 per cent, compared with 22 per cent in Scotland and the North East.

The survey showed that 45 per cent of people interviewed from Oxford and 43 per cent of those from Hull believed they have a guardian angel. This figure fell to 16 per cent for those in Edinburgh and Plymouth.

But researchers warned that the city results were based on small numbers – with just 17 people interviewed from Oxford, 19 from Hull, 39 from Edinburgh and 27 from Plymouth.

This may be because they use an angel as a coping mechanism to deal with their fear and anxiety over perceived risks in their environment, experts say
