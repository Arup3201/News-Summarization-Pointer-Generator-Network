Lionel Messi enjoyed some well-earned relaxation time with his girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo after demolishing Athletic Bilbao on Sunday night.

The Barcelona superstar was rampant throughout so it wasn't a surprise to see him taking things easy on Monday.

Messi, who scored one and made two goals in the 5-2 thumping of Bilbao, took to Instagram to post a snap of him and his girlfriend Roccuzzo at their home.

It also gave the Ballon d’Or runner up the chance to reveal a glimpse of his new tattoo.

It’s his third and is the biggest of the designs so far, taking up the majority of the 27-year-old’s upper arm.

Messi also has a tattoo of his mother’s face as well as the hand of his son Thiago with his name underneath.
