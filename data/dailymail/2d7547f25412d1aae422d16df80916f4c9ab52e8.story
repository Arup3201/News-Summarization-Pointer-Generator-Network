A pregnant woman, her partner and their eight-month-old son died in a head-on car crash in southwest Queensland on Thursday evening.

Shannah McKellar, 24, Peter Kirby, 33, and their son Seth from Chinchilla, about 300km west of Brisbane, were travelling west on the Diamantina Development Road near Quilpie when their Ford Falcon sedan collided with a ute driving in the opposite direction just after 5pm.

Adding to their family's pain was the fact that Shannah's sister Toni died in a car crash on the same road in 2009.

After Thursday's crash the 57-year-old male driver and sole occupant of the other vehicle was flown to Brisbane with suspected spinal injuries but it has since been revealed he did not sustain such injuries.

Shannah leaves behind two children and Peter leaves behind five children.

Shannah's niece Kim McKellar, 24, said her aunt came from a big family and everybody was in shock.

'We've had three aunties that have passed away through the last few years in a car accident and most have had little children with them,' Ms McKellar said.

'Brings up the same hurt that we've just come through.

'We lost aunty Toni McKellar in 2009 on the same road, she's survived by six children.

'In 2001, we lost Natasha McKellar, she died in a car crash coming from NSW, she died with her little niece and her daughter. She's survived by her children too.'

The couple moved to Chinchilla, 300km west of Brisbane, six months ago and their son was eight months old

Shannah and Peter moved to Chinchilla six months ago to start their life with their newborn child and Shannah was more than three months pregnant with their second child together.

'She was really excited about having that baby. She loved Peter with all her heart,' Ms McKellar said.

She added that Shannah was 'beautiful' and Peter was 'a real gentleman'.

'She had a lot of love to give and always loved travelling, loved her kids, loved every single one of them,' she said.

'She used to call him her husband. They weren't married but she would say "He's my husband."

'He was beautiful, very protective. He'd do anything for his family, he loved his mum.

'Had a big heart for all his younger brothers.'

Ms McKellar said the couple loved to travel to visit family and friends.

'They were just going on a tour, that was normal for them, they'd get itchy feet and just want to go for a drive,' she said.

Ms McKellar's niece Jamie-Lee McKellar said she was 'too shocked for words'.

'Just wish this was all a dream,' she posted on Facebook.

'You'll be sadly missed but never forgotten.'

Another family member, Leanne McKellar, the tragedy was hard to believe

'I can't stop crying I can't sleep it is hard,' she wrote on Facebook.

'We just had to break da news to my dad an he did not take it so well.'

Charleville Police investigating officer Andrew Irvine, who will provide a forensic crash report to the coroner, said police were looking at a number of factors.

'We are looking at visibility issues such as the setting sun, and a couple of other things I'm not at liberty to say,' he told MailOnline.

Western Downs Mayor Ray Brown said his thoughts were with the family's loved ones.

'The feeling of our community at the moment is one of extreme loss,' Mr Brown said.

'The Chinchilla community is a very close knit community, we've had a lot of challenges in our community over the year.

'And any loss of life is incredibly sad.'
