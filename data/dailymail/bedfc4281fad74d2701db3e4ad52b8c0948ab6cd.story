She has fronted campaigns for the likes of Burberry, Doc Martens, and Mulberry, but 29-year-old Agyness Deyn has decided to call time on her modelling career.

The British beauty confirmed she has 'officially' stopped modelling in favour of pursuing her love of acting because she has grown disenchanted with the fashion industry over time.

She said: 'I suppose I have stopped modelling officially. I've not done any for a good long while now. I think it was about four years ago when my feeling were changing towards the industry.

'I didn't hate it, but I was yearning to do something different. I was on a gradient. I was something different.'

Deyn, who this year played a stripper in remake of Nicolas 
Winding Refn's 1996 cult classic, Pusher, saw her preference switch from fashion to film with each new role she landed.

The star's acting career began in 2010 when she played Aphrodite in Clash of the Titans. In 2011 she appeared as a warrior 
in Woodkid's debut music video.

Following on from the success of Pusher, she made her West End stage debut as Paula in François 
Archambault's comedy, The Leisure Society, for which she received rave 
reviews.

Deyn, who is now settled in New York 
with husband Giovanni Ribisi, 37 whom she married in a ceremony earlier this 
year, says she doesn't begrudge spending 10 years of her life travelling
the world for her sake of her modelling career because it gave her the 
creative desire to try acting.

She explained to The New Review: 'Oh god, I loved it. Being 18 years old, from Manchester, and suddenly having this new world to explore - being able to travel, meet all these different people, and immerse myself in all these different cultures - was just so much fun.

'I got spotted [by a modelling agency] and I've had this great chunk of time - 10 years - to find out what I really wanted to do, which is to act.'

New goals: The star wants to focus on her acting career - and this year she appeared in On The Road with Richard Coyle
