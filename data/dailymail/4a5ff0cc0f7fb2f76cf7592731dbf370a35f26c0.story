A Sydney man has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent and refused bail after a nine-month-old baby boy in his care suffered serious head injuries.

The infant was rushed to the Children's Hospital at Westmead on Wednesday afternoon after paramedics and police were informed that the child had been injured at his Lalor Park home on Koorool Avenue.

He is currently in a critical but stable condition.

The 31-year-old man initially told the hospital that the child had sustained the injuries after he had accidentally dropped him.

However further investigations of the incident by detectives from State Crime Command's Child Abuse Squad and officers from Quakers Hill police, found the circumstances to be suspicious.

The man, believed to be the de facto father of the child, was arrested and charged on Friday night at Fairfield Heights.

The man initially claimed the child was injured after he had accidentally dropped him. However further police investigations of the incident found the injuries to be inconsistent with the claims

He will appear at the Parramatta Court later today.

Neighbours expressed their shock at the incident, saying the man and his partner, who appear to be parents of another child, seemed like a happy, quiet couple.

'I used to see him walking his baby girl, she's about eight years old in a wheel chair, up and down the street, he seemed to be a good bloke,' one shocked neighbour told 9 News.
