Cesc Fabregas has revealed Jose Mourinho missed his son's football match to sign him for Chelsea.

The £27million signing has joined up with his new team-mates for pre-season training in Austria after Spain's dismal World Cup.

And the former Arsenal captain was persuaded to join the Blues from Barcelona after the intervention from Mourinho.

'When I knew Chelsea wanted to buy me, I studied the situation well and talked things over with my family,' Fabregas told the Mirror.

'But then I spoke to the boss, on the day Jose came to see me.

'I remember it was a Sunday afternoon, and he flew out, missing his son's final game of the season.

'For him to do that was to make a great effort, to tell me how much he wanted me to sign for Chelsea. That gave me a real lift.'

Chelsea have already picked up two wins in pre-season against Wycombe and Wimbledon, and take on RZ Pellets in their first match of the tour on Wednesday night.
