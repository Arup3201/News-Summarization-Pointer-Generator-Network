Britain's economy is firing on all cylinders for the first time since 2010 after official figures showed growth has doubled since the start of the year.

George Osborne hailed growing indications that the UK is ‘on the mend’ as the Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product rose by 0.6 per cent in the three months to June, after a 0.3 per cent rise in the first quarter.

It is the first time for two years that Britain has recorded back-to-back quarters of growth and bolstered hopes that the country is finally on the road to a sustainable recovery.

Recovery: Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show the economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2013, but remains 3.3 per cent below the pre-crash peak in 2008

Crucially, all four sectors of the economy – services, industrial production, construction and agriculture – grew for the first time since 2010.

The Chancellor said growth was well ahead of the 0.2 per cent forecast by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility at the time of the Budget in March – but warned there was a ‘long way to go’.

The dominant services sector, which makes up three-quarters of economic output in Britain, was the driving force, as it grew by 0.6 per cent.

But the smaller areas of the economy also grew. Production was up 0.6 per cent, with output from British factories up 0.4 per cent, while construction grew by 0.9 per cent and agriculture by 1.1 per cent.

The news left Labour – which has repeatedly claimed the Government’s spending cuts are strangling growth and recovery – in a difficult position.

Mr Osborne said: ‘Britain is holding its nerve, we are sticking to our plan, and the British economy is on the mend – but there is still a long way to go and I know things are still tough for families.

‘So I will not let up in my determination to make sure we put right all that went wrong in our economy.

‘The people who should take the credit are businesses and hardworking families who have come through this period and we are starting to see the results.’

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said that while the recovery was ‘welcome’, it was still the slowest for 100 years. He added: ‘Families on middle and low incomes are still not seeing any recovery in their living standards. Most people will be thinking, “It’s working? It’s not working for me.”’

However, a poll by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research showed confidence in the economy is at its highest for more than three years.

Yesterday’s figures also showed gross domestic product remains 3.3 per cent below its peak in Labour’s debt-fuelled boom, and wages and savings rates are failing to keep pace with the rising cost of living.

They showed economic output crashed by 7.2 per cent in 2008 and 2009 as the crisis struck.

‘The numbers today confirm that we had one of the deepest recessions in our history, one of the deepest recessions in the world,’ Mr Osborne said.

Despite the welcome figures, it is feared that an escalation of the crisis in the eurozone and the slowdown in China could yet knock the recovery off course.

Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ‘For the first time since the financial crisis the economy looks and feels as if there is a tailwind behind it. We are optimistic the current rate of growth can be maintained.’

Ernst & Young Item Club adviser Nida Ali said: ‘This is very encouraging and qualifies as the right kind of growth that we have been lacking over the past couple of years.’

Yesterday's figures appeared to show that Britain is on the road to recovery. Here the Mail’s City Editor, Alex Brummer, gives his view.

It has taken a long time to happen but the British economy finally started to motor in the three months to June. The figures suggest growth is running at a 1.4 per cent rate on an annual basis – more than twice the forecast made by the OBR in March.

Even so, the British economy remains, along with that of Italy, among the worst performing of the G7 richest countries since the Great Recession  of 2008-09.

Total output will have to rise by a further 3.3 per cent to return to where it was at the peak of the New Labour boom in early 2008.

However, the really encouraging thing is that growth is gathering momentum with each successive quarter despite the drag on exports caused by the downturn in the eurozone.

And even that may be taking a turn for the better with the German business confidence index climbing sharply. Behind Britain’s renaissance is a strong pick-up in the services economy, which includes everything from finance, to IT and the creative industries.

Economic expansion is the result of tens of thousands of ordinary businesses having the confidence to invest and households having the courage to spend.

It is significant that growth is now coming from all sectors, including industrial production and construction.

There is a widespread belief among the economic analysts that the figures just released could yet be revised upwards to reflect the full scale of the improvement in construction aided by the Funding for Lending and Help to Buy schemes.

Meanwhile all eyes will now be upon the first press conference of new Bank of England governor Mark Carney on August 7, when he has promised to provide guidance on the path to economic growth.

This is expected to include a long period ahead of super-low interest rates of 0.5 per cent as well as continued support for measures designed to keep credit flowing.

A further sign of the improved conditions has been bumper results from some of our biggest enterprises, including aerospace engine supplier Rolls-Royce, consumer products giant Unilever and high street pub owner Mitchells & Butlers.

One benefit of a faster-growing economy is that tax revenues such as VAT and income tax rise, helping to bring down the budget deficit.

But if the Government really wants to drive longer-term recovery it will need to find more innovative ways of funding infrastructure spending, to adopt reforms to the planning system and to introduce more tax breaks for investment by small businesses.
