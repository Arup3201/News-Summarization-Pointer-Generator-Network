A furniture shop refused to repair a pensioner's armchairs - after claiming she had ruined them with sweat caused by her medication.

Grandmother Barbara Challons, of Mosborough, South Yorkshire, bought the two two-seater armchairs from Harveys Furniture Store three years ago and says they have always had problems.

The company have sent her several spare parts but after repeated complaints they finally called at her home to fix them.

An inspector from Harveys asked her if she was on any medication and she replied 'yes'.

The 79-year-old was later stunned to receive a letter saying the medication had caused her to sweat and 'contaminated' the £500 chairs - meaning staff could not repair them.

Mrs Challons said: 'I'm upset about it. People will think I'm dirty and I'm not dirty. They will think my house is scruffy.

'What makes me so cross is that they're saying these chairs are greasy. I'm really hurt by what they've made me look.

'If they didn't want to fix the chairs, why couldn't they use a problem with the furniture as an excuse.

'Instead they've made a personal attack on me and my health. People will think "what's wrong with her?"'

The note from the company's repair partner, read: 'We have advised the customer that as she takes medication, this has affected the sofa.

'She does take high blood pressure tablets, this is unrepairable as now contaminated.

'The chairs are nearly three years old, this is from sweat through taking medication. No repair possible.'

After receiving the letter Barbara showed it to her doctor who 'laughed at it' and described it as 'nonsense'.

Widowed Mrs Challons, a retired auxiliary nurse, had applied for the chairs to be repaired by the shop.

But the worker who visited her home asked her whether she was diabetic or on any blood pressure medication, to which she replied 'yes'.

She said she later found this was used as a reason not to fix the chairs, which she said had been 'plagued with problems'. 

Mrs Challons added: 'It's a load of rubbish. To say my taking tablets damaged the chairs is unreal.'

Mrs Challons said she had recently ordered two new armchairs, which are currently being handmade.

She added: 'As soon as they arrive, I'm throwing these out. I can't wait to see the back of them.'

Accompanying the report, Harveys said there was 'no manufacturing defect' and that she would need to pay an upholsterer to assess the chairs to challenge the decision.

A spokesman from Harveys said: ‘Our Customer Service team have conducted a detailed review of Ms Challon’s concerns. 

'Our technician carried out a thorough testing of the material and determined that, given the staining on the product, repairing it was not an option and also the age of the product, that we would not be prepared to offer any compensation.

'We do, however, appreciate that our technician could have handled the situation more sensitively. 

'We have tried to contact Ms Challon to discuss the matter and offer a small goodwill gesture for any distress we may have caused in dealing with her concerns. 

'As always, Harveys remains committed to offering the highest level of customer service to its customers and dealing with every issue fairly and transparently.’
