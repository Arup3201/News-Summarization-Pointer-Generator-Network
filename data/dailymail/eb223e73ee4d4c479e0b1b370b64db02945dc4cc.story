Starbucks has become an unlikely wedding venue for couples who are eager to marry their caffeine addiction with their unwavering commitment to one another.

The popular coffee chain, which has more than 12,000 locations around the country, has seen a huge increase in the number of patrons wanting to tie the knot in-store – with many choosing to document their coffee-fueled ceremonies on Instagram, using the hashtag #StarbucksWedding.

One such couple, DeAnna Dodson, 31, and Jordan Senz, 32, chose to wed at a Starbucks in Janesville, Wisconsin, on New Year's Eve, and unsurprisingly the ceremony featured plenty of coffee puns. 

The Beloit, Wisconsin, couple told Walworth County Today that their vows included the statement: 'I promise to love you a latte.'

'I want to macchiato an honest woman out of you,' Mr Senz proclaimed to his bride, according to the Daily Independent.

Naturally, the wedding party enjoyed a cup of java before going to breakfast.

The couple, who met in 2001 while working at Burger King, had been engaged since 2007 but had put off the wedding for financial reasons.

Finally, on December 17, Mr Senz called his fiancee and asked if they could hold their nuptials on the 31st.

The final challenge was finding an officiant to marry them on a holiday.

Mrs Senz said: 'I had gone online and found a reverend, Rev. Donnie [Onley] and we were either going to have to go to his home or pick a public location to meet him at. We said we'll meet him at Starbucks because we go to one every morning anyway.'

Rather than holding the event at their usual Beloit Starbucks, they opted for the chain's Janesville location, 15 minutes north, in an effort to 'fly under the radar' and avoid unwanted attention for their unusual venue choice.

The couple dressed casually, in jeans and sweatshirts, and didn't even tell Starbucks that they'd be holding their wedding there.

Mr Senz told the Gazette Extra that the backdrop made perfect sense, since they start every morning at Starbucks.

'It just feels great, and it's a fun way to start the first official day of the rest of the year and our lives together.'

And Mr and Mrs Senz are not alone - other couples and local Starbucks branches have been posting photos of ceremonies at the coffee chain on Instagram, using the hashtag #StarbucksWedding.

Congratulations to the couple who just signed their marriage certificates! #HePutARingOnIt #MarriageMonday #StarbucksWedding #truelove.'

Another Starbucks in Ladue, Missouri, shared a photo of a bride and her bridesmaids in its store with the words: 'Cake pops for everyone! #starbucks #tobeapartner #starbuckswedding.' 

Instagram user Carlee Reddick posted a photo from a ceremony she witnessed with the caption: 'Starbucks steampunk wedding. Yes this wedding happened inside starbucks. #Starbucks #starbuckspartner #tobeapartner #starbuckswedding.' 

And Tym Kemp shared a picture of a wedding ceremony he performed in a Starbucks, commenting: 'This one was really special.' 

There are currently 92 Instagram posts featuring the #StarbucksWedding hashtag and that number is likely to increase.
