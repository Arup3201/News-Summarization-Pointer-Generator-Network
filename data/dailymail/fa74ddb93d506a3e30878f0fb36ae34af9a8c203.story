Arsenal midfielders Mesut Ozil and Mathieu Flamini were smartly dressed and out to celebrate the latter's birthday on Saturday.  

Ozil posted a picture of the pair posing on his official Twitter account. 

Now 31-year-old Flamini has made over 200 appearances for Arsenal across two separate spells at the north London club.

The Frenchman initially joined Arsene Wenger's side from Marseille back in 2004, before moving to AC Milan four seasons later. 

After five campaigns in Serie A, Flamini returned to the Emirates Stadium in 2013. His positional versatility has seen him play all across the midfield and occasionally in defence. 

Despite his advancing years, Flamini has proven this season that he still has plenty to offer playing at the highest level and has the best accuracy rating of any midfielder to have made 500 or more passes in the Premier League (91.8%).  

At 31, Flamini still has a lot to offer the Premier League and boasts a 91.8% passing accuracy this season
