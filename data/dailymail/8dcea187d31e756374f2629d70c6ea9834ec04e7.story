Murdered: Evelyn Miller, pictured, was found dumped on the banks of an Iowa river in 2005

A criminal accused of raping and murdering his girlfriend's five-year-old daughter seven years ago made his first court appearance yesterday.

Casey Frederiksen, 33, is charged with first-degree murder and first degree sexual abuse in the 2005 slaying of Floyd, Iowa, girl, Evelyn Miller.

During the 10 minute appearance at Floyd District Court, Frederiksen's bond was set at $1 million on each charge but he wouldn't be let loose even if he could come up with the money, because he's currently serving a 14-year sentence on child porn and drug charges.

Evelyn was reported missing on July 1, 2005, by her mother Noel Miller.

Frederiksen had been caring for the five-year-old, along with the couple's two other children, when she disappeared.

The child's body was found five days later on the banks of the nearby Cedar River, but details of the girl's death were never released.

In a celebrated breakthrough for a case that had long frustrated relatives and investigators, Frederiksen was last month charged with Evelyn's murder after he made remarks in jail that showed he knew information about her death that investigators had never made public.

While incarcerated, Frederiksen would cry and say, 'I'm sorry Evelyn',' one inmate told investigators.

Another inmate said that Frederiksen talked about touching the girl's dead body and carrying her to the river. A third said Frederiksen told him he'd molested the girl for years.

Frederiksen claimed to police in 2007 that an acquaintance had taken the girl at knifepoint and never brought her back. He later said that he made up that claim, an affidavit says.

Frederiksen told another inmate the girl was found with her clothes on – a detail not released by investigators. And in 2009, after he was indicted on meth charges, he allegedly told another inmate he could 'get away with murder and still do life.'

'What a glorious afternoon it is,' Floyd County Sheriff Rick Lynch said after the 33-year-old was dealt the charges last month. He thanked Floyd's residents for their patience during the seven-year investigation.

Frederiksen has been returned to Iowa from a federal prison in Illinois where he was serving the separate child porn sentence. A preliminary hearing is set for October 26.

In yesterday's brief appearance, Frederiksen told magistrate Ann 
Troge he was concerned about his personal safety due to jailhouse death 
threats, according to Radio Iowa.

Frederiksen also raised an objection 
to expanded media coverage of his initial appearance but magistrate 
Troge overruled the him.

If convicted, Frederiksen would face life in prison as Iowa does not have the death penalty.

Evelyn's mother reported her missing after returning from an overnight shift as a nurse's aide.

Kayakers discovered the girl's body days later two miles away on the banks of the river. Investigators had questioned Frederiksen in the death – giving him immunity to testify about drug activities, but he was never charged.

A police affidavit filed on September 27 laying out the case against Frederiksen did not mention whether a murder weapon was discovered.

An autopsy found Evelyn died of sharp force injuries, including wounds to the neck, and that there was evidence of sexual assault. Those details were never released to the public.

The affidavit paints Frederiksen as acting erratically and lying after the girl vanished, being addicted to child pornography involving young girls, and making incriminating statements while in prison.

It says FBI dogs picked up Frederiksen's scent near where authorities believe the girl entered the river.

Frederiksen claimed he last saw Evelyn asleep on a loveseat when he woke up to change a boy's diaper at 2am. But as volunteers were searching for Evelyn in coming days, Frederiksen didn't join them and instead went with a friend on a trip to Des Moines and Waterloo, the affidavit says.

The girl's paternal grandparents, Richard and Linda Christie of Waterloo, said the day Frederiksen was charged was the happiest day they've had in seven years and praised investigators for their work.

They remembered the girl, who would be 12, as loving to dress in pink, having a beautiful smile, and celebrating Halloween as her favorite holiday.

Richard Christie called the arrest a 'bittersweet moment' since Frederiksen had been a friend of their son and they knew him since he was a child, 'so it's a tragedy both ways.' Linda Christie was less diplomatic.

'He has done hideous things. He raped and murdered my granddaughter. I am not in the mood to forgive someone who could do that to an innocent little girl,' she said. 'Justice will be done.'
