The United States Central Command has released four new videos showing the latest attacks made by a U.S./Arab coalition against Islamic State militants.

The footage, which was posted to Centcom's YouTube account, shows missiles destroying vehicles and buildings used by the terror group in both Syria and Iraq.

In one clip a tank driven by the militants  is seen being destroyed, while in another a small vehicle explodes into flames having suffered a direct hit. Both attacks took place on roads in Iraq.

Elsewhere a missile is filmed slamming into an ISIS-held building near the Syrian border town Al-Hasaka, and a weapons storage facility also in Syria is seen being destroyed.

Centcom has so-far released more than 20 videos of attacks against ISIS and other militant groups in the Syria and Iraq. It has also released footage of rescue and aid operations in the region. 

The release of the videos comes as it was claimed ISIS militants are withdrawing into smaller bases and leaving Twitter to avoid being killed by Western forces.

International observers and witnesses have claimed the jihadists - whose aggressive presence on social media was until now part of their campaign of fear - appear to be turning more wary  to avoid being tracked down and destroyed.

The claims were made ahead of British jets hitting another Islamic State target in Iraq yesterday, as  calls grow for the attacks to be extended into the group's strongholds in Syria.

Locked on: An American fighter jet identified this building as a weapons storage facility in Syria

Taken out: Despite filming from a great height, it is clear the jet's missile destroyed the weapons facility, due to the large clouds of black smoke

Attack: In this shot a missile is seen slamming into an ISIS-held building near the Syrian border town Al-Hasaka

Hit: The explosion caused by the blast at the ISIS-held building sent a large fireball high into the air

Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Centre in Qatar, said Isis appeared to have imposed a 'total social media and electronic blackout' on its own fighters.

A message in Arabic, apparently banning militants from taking photographs during battle, was circulated on Twitter with the Arabic hashtag #MediaSecrecyCampaign after the British Parliament overwhelmingly voted to join U.S. air strikes.

Mr Lister told The Times the message appeared to be genuine, and 'gained solid traction across the IS and pro-Islamic State camps shortly after being published'.

He added: 'If it is indeed genuine, it's symbolic of the pressure that IS has been placed under in recent weeks'.

British experts have run voice recognition tests on propaganda videos such as those of the 'executioner' Jihadi John, and it is thought militants want to give agents as few clues as possible as to their identity or whereabouts.

Reports from Iraq also suggest Isis are switching to a more low-key operation on the ground - switching convoys for motorcycles, using phones less and hoisting their black flag on empty houses to confuse jet pilots.

An unnamed tribal sheikh who lives near Kirkuk, northern Iraq, told the Reuters news agency Isis had 'abandoned one of their biggest headquarters' in his village.

'They took all their furniture, vehicles and weapons,' he said on the day British air strikes were approved.

'Then
they planted roadside bombs and destroyed the headquarters.

'They don't move in military convoys like before. Instead
they use motorcycles, bicycles, and if necessary, they use
camouflaged cars.'

U.S. Navy Vice Admiral John Miller also acknowledged the militants had changed tack. 

He told ABC News on Sunday: 'They're an adaptive force, and we've seen them adapt to the airstrikes that we're doing.' 

Islamic State fighters beheaded seven men and three women in a Kurdish area of northern Syria, a monitoring group reports.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, among them three women, and four Syrian Arabs were beheaded near the town of Kobani.

The Kurdish fighters were taken prisoner during the battle for the mainly Kurdish town, also known as Ayn Arab, which is close to the Turkish border and has been besieged by Islamic State forces.

Dozens of militants and Kurdish fighters were killed in the fighting, said SOHR.

Rami Abdulrahman, head of the Observatory, said a Kurdish male civilian was also beheaded. 'I don't know why they were arrested or beheaded. Only the Islamic State knows why. They want to scare people,' he said.

Images posted on social media networks show women's heads placed on a cement block, said to be in the northern Syrian city of Jarablous, which is held by militants.

Women fight alongside men in the Kurdish People's Protection Units, known as the YPG, which is the official armed wing of the main Kurdish political group in Syria.

Kurdish forces have been locked in fierce clashes with Islamic State militants in and around Kobani since the extremist group launched an assault in mid-September.

The fighting has created one of the single largest exoduses in Syria's civil war, with more than 160,000 people fleeing into Turkey, UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said yesterday.
