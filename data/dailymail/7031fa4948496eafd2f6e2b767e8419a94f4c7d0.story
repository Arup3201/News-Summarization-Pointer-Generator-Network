A four-year-old boy who was allegedly starved and murdered by his mother and stepfather tried to eat the core of a piece of fruit after taking it out of a school bin, a court heard today.

Teaching assistant Beatrice O'Brien said she and other members of staff watched Daniel Pelka reach into a bin in the playground on one occasion and ‘pick out either the core of an apple or a pear’.

She said shortly before his death he felt ‘like a bag of bones’ and his skin was ‘ashen-coloured’.

Schoolboy: Daniel Pelka, four, allegedly died from a head injury after an 'incomprehensible' campaign of abuse

Daniel, of Coventry, West Midlands, allegedly died from a head injury after an ‘incomprehensible’ campaign of abuse at the hands of Magdelena Luczak, 27 and her partner Mariusz Krezolek, 33.

On day three of their trial at Birmingham Crown Court, the jury heard that teachers at Little Heath Primary School watched inside the staffroom from 30ft away as Daniel reached into a bin.

‘We watched him walk up to the bin, look to see if anyone was looking and pick out either the core of an apple or a pear and he started to eat it,’ Mrs O'Brien said.

Later that same day, she said he took an empty tube of yoghurt from a bin in the classroom ‘and was trying to get the last bit of yoghurt out’. ‘I said to him “Oh no Daniel, don't do that”,’ she added.

The problem of Daniel taking food in school became so frequent that Mrs O'Brien said teachers stopped punishing him, and started ‘gently’ explaining to him what he was doing was wrong. She said: ‘We started to think it was an obvious problem and almost became something he couldn't help.’

She added that the instances of him 
taking food grew as time went on from ‘once or twice’ to ‘any 
opportunity’. Mrs O’Brien said: ‘I believed he might have had some sort 
of eating disorder.’

On the last afternoon he was at school, Mrs O'Brien said he tried to shell and eat ‘dried kidney beans’ that were part of the children's sandtable. ‘He had sand around his mouth,’ she said.

‘Then I really noticed that the sand didn't really stick - there wasn't much saliva and his mouth seemed very dry.’

She passed her concerns on to colleagues at the time. When he first started at the school in September 2011, she described him as ‘quiet, he was small, he had a cheeky side’.

‘Sometimes he could be quite awkward or stubborn if he didn't like the look of an activity,’ Mrs O'Brien said.

Describing how he looked on the last day he attended school in March 1 2012, she said: ‘I was very concerned. He did not look at all well and he had lost a lot of weight. His skin colour was ashen, it wasn't healthy.’

She added that he had ‘dark circles under
his eyes’ and said she tickled him on one occasion, because of her 
concerns about his health, to find ‘he felt like a bag of bones’.

Mrs O'Brien said Daniel started school with a smart haircut and well-fitting uniform, but towards the end of his life ‘he seemed to be wasting away’, his hair was untidy, and his uniform was too big for him.

Mrs O'Brien said Daniel was ‘quite solitary’ and he ‘walked around with his hands in his pockets’.

Earlier, headteacher Darren Clews said Luczak and Krezolek went to the school on March 5 looking ‘upset’ and explained to him that Daniel had died.

'We watched him walk up to the bin, look to see if anyone was looking and pick out either the core of an apple or a pear and he started to eat it'

Afterwards, Luczak's barrister Stephen Linehan QC said it was accepted that his client had given Mr Clews a false account of the events leading up to the child's death.

Mr Clews confirmed the details of the school's register showing that between September 14 2011, when Daniel started school, and his death in March 2012, he had missed 28-and-a-half days at school.

Daniel, whose mother and stepfather came to Britain from Poland in 2006, was pronounced dead in the early hours of March 3 after paramedics were called to his home.

Krezolek and Luczak deny murder and causing or allowing the death of a child. The trial continues.
