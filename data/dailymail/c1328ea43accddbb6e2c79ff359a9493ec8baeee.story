Mathieu Bastareaud and Thierry Dusautoir's imposing frames may not have delivered for France this Six Nations but they made the day of some young stars of the future on Wednesday. 

France have just one win from their three this tournament but will be looking to turn that around in Rome when they take on Italy, one of the two team's behind them on the table.  

Before they got down to business on Wednesday with their preparations ahead of their clash with Italy, Bastareaud, Dusautoir and Co showed their squad remains in good spirits with a pre-training session with local children in Marcoussis.

Les Bleus enjoyed a jovial run with young players at their training base just south of Paris, which included kids struggling to bring down massive centre Bastareaud and Dusautoir appearing to enjoy his customary role of towering over all even more than usual.

Once the fun was over though Philippe Saint-Andre was laying down the law as they prepared for their visit to Rome on Sunday where they'll be keen to add to their solitary win of the tournament.

France, who are fourth behind Ireland, Wales and England, have been far from convincing so far this campaign, accounting only for Scotland 15-8 in their opening match.

With losses back to back against Ireland and Wales - both by just seven points - they'll be eager to give fans a glimpse of the potential their coach is convinced they have at their disposal.

They will be expected to come away from Stadio Olimpico with maximum points, but their last two trips to Rome have ended in disappointment for France. 

After venting following the Wales defeat, Saint-Andre put his support behind his players this week, saying he had 'faith' in them to turn things around in Italy.  

'The team has a lot of potential,' he said. 'Over the last two and half years we've learned a lot. I have a group of professionals, and a good team, but they need to maximise their potential.

'Saturday (against Wales), we were only at 70-80 per cent. As a coach, but also as a lover of rugby, I expect a lot more from this team. I have faith in this squad.

'They have the right values, and they are doing well as a squad. They need to do more on the pitch, as a team and individually. They need to take the initiative.

'But honestly, if we didn't believe in them, we'd have changed lots of players. On Sunday in Italy I expect a reaction because we have a squad with values and they will show it on Sunday.'

They'll be doing it without winger Sofiane Guitoune, who's been ruled out with a hamstring injury picked up for Bordeaux-Begles in their defeat by Stade Francais at the weekend. 

It's a blow to Guitoune who got his first start in this Six Nations against Wales. He'll be replaced by Racing Metro's Marc Andreu. 

'Disappointed to leave the team but a bit bothered by my hamstring which prevents me from being 100%. Supporting the team with all my heart,' Guitoune said on Twitter.
