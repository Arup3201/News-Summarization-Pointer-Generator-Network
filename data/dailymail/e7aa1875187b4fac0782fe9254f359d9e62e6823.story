Up and down the country, families hit by the passport crisis have been left wondering whether they will be able to take their holidays.

But these civil servants – including a number from the Home Office – had no such worries as they enjoyed a taxpayer subsidised yachting trip.

Drinking heavily and racing each other in top-of-the-range boats, the 128 staff from a range of government departments and agencies took part in a six-day ‘team building and bonding’ regatta on the Isle of Wight.

The trip, branded a ‘taxpayer-subsidised booze Armada’, even saw a number of officials from the Ministry of Defence enjoying duck terrine and roast lamb on Thursday – as it was announced that more than 1,000 troops were being made redundant.

Some civil servants boasted that they were paid to be there and joked on social networking sites that it was just another ‘hard day at the office’.

They said they had been granted taxpayer-funded ‘special paid leave’, usually reserved for family bereavements.

The £27,319 cost of chartering the yachts was subsidised by a civil service sports group which received £600,000 this year from the Cabinet Office.

Last night, politicians and taxpayer groups expressed outrage that the event was allowed to take place at all at a time of cuts – and particularly when the Passport Office faces immense pressure from the public to clear its backlog.

They said the civil servants should be made to repay any public funds they received for the work holiday.

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘It is lucky their jolly jaunt wasn’t overseas or they would have had trouble getting their passports in time.

‘This is further evidence that the Whitehall machine is run for the convenience of those who work there rather than the taxpayer.’

Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West and a member of the public administration committee, said: ‘There is no justification for a taxpayer subsidised booze armada.

‘On the one hand there are fanatical reductions in the civil service – but on the other there is this spending on sinful and self-indulgent jaunts.’

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘This is a shocking waste of money. There’s plenty of important work to do in Whitehall, and none of it is going to get done while mandarins are relaxing on yachts.’

The Civil Service annual Inter Departmental Offshore Regatta ran for six days from Sunday and featured 17 eight-person yachts, including three from the Ministry of Defence.

Officials from the Home Office, Meteorological Office, National Crime Agency, Department for Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs also took part.

The regatta culminated on Thursday with a three-course meal at a prestigious sailing club.

Wearing official T-shirts printed specially for the trip, the civil servants ate and drank copious amounts of alcohol in a marquee overlooking the sea, while served by a team  of waitresses.

Soon after collecting the 36ft yachts on Sunday, members of the MoD team from the UK Hydrographic Office posted photos of themselves eating dinner and drinking cider and wine on board.

They later updated followers on Twitter about the fun they had during a quiz on the Monday night.

Every evening, after returning to their berths in Cowes, the civil servants drank heavily on the boats and in pubs across town. Some could be seen in jackets bearing the name of their government department.

Empty bottles of Bombay Sapphire gin, Desperados beer, Polish vodka, white and red wine and cans of Boddingtons beer could be seen discarded on the boats as they partied until the early hours.

They ate an array of exotic cheeses, as well as crisps and dips and made Thai curries on board, while calling out to passers-by: ‘Come! Have a drink!’

On Wednesday evening, the yacht crews attended a ‘Pairs Pontoon Party,’ which involved eating curry and drinking Pimm’s until midnight.

One member of the MoD team said three of her colleagues had been granted special leave to be there.

The provision, usually reserved for paternity leave or family bereavements, allows staff to be paid full salary while away, at taxpayers’ expense. ‘I can’t wait to come again next year,’ she said. ‘The weather’s been amazing. There has been a lot of drink.’  

Tom Powell, who was on the trip, tweeted a picture of one of the yachts sailing in the sun, captioned with the hashtag ‘#harddayattheoffice’.

On Thursday evening, the teams attended a ‘regatta dinner’ party at the 18th century Royal Corinthian Yacht Club building, known for hosting parties attended by the monarchy.

They arrived in uniforms bearing the names of their departments, while a female Met Office employee could be seen downing a bottle of beer as she walked to the venue.

Home Office officials raced as part of a UK Border Force team as thousands of families faced long waits for their passports amid mounting chaos at UK passport offices.

The MoD is in the process of cutting billions of pounds from its budget, scrapping jets and warships.

On Thursday, it announced 1,060 armed forces redundancies in its latest round of cuts.

Meanwhile, HMRC staff attended the regatta only four months after employees of the same department went on strike over their employment rights.

The trip also follows thousands of civil service job losses since 2010.

Last night, the MoD admitted staff were allowed to take up to two days special paid leave for the trip, on top of their annual holiday entitlement.

Official Civil Service HR guidance states: ‘Typical reasons for special leave include situations such as the death of a close relative.’ 

The Met Office also confirmed its staff would have been allowed paid time off.

Other departments refused to comment, despite crews boasting about the paid time off during the week while out drinking in pubs.

Civil servants could take part in the trip only if they were part of the Civil Service Sports Council, a not-for-profit organisation which this year received £600,000 from the taxpayer.

The Cabinet office last night said staff were ‘expected’ to take leave for the regatta, although it was up to individual departments to decide if paid special leave was granted.

It said the event raised money for charity and insisted the funding it gives to the CSSC was not specifically used for the sailing trip.

The Home Office said its staff were not among those given special leave.
