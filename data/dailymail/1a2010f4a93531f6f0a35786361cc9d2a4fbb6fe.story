QPR manager Harry Redknapp has revealed that Rio Ferdinand turned down the chance to join two top London clubs in favour of the west London side this summer.

Redknapp made the former Manchester United defender his first signing of the summer yesterday, and when speaking at the club's training base in Harlington on Friday morning expressed his delight at getting the deal over the line.

He said: 'Rio is going to be a fantastic player for the club. You watch him on TV at the World Cup and you can see he is a class act on and off the pitch.

'You will always have doubters who say he's finished but I back my judgment. Paul Merson turned the club round for me at Portsmouth. I had Teddy Sheringham and Sol Campbell when everyone was saying he was finished and he was the best centre half in the PL when he was with me.

'He had other offers too. He could've gone to two top London clubs who wanted to speak to him.

'There he might have played and not played, but he wanted to come here. I can't say who they were but that's 100 per cent fact.'

Redknapp also took the opportunity to talk to Manchester United assistant manager Ryan Giggs - someone who knows Ferdinand well after spending 12 years with him at Old Trafford.

He added: 'I spoke to Ryan Giggs, not that I had any doubts, and he told me if he had still been manager this season Rio would have been his number one centre half.

'When he had that spell in charge the first thing he did was put Rio in the team. He was fit all season. It was just a case of David (Moyes) going in and turning a few things around. He was one of the four or five fittest players at the club.'

Elsewhere, Redknapp also confirmed that Esteban Granero will remain with the west Londoners this season after uncertainty over his future.

The 27-year-old spent last season on loan at Real Sociedad, but missed a prolonged part of the campaign after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament. However, Redknapp is delighted to be able to welcome the Spaniard back to his squad this term.

'Granero has come back fit. He's a smashing lad, a good character. He wants to stay. Let's hope he has a good season.'
