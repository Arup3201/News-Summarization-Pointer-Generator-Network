A dog described by police as 'the most dangerous we have ever seen' after it tried to bite a nine-year-old girl's head off has been ordered to be destroyed by a judge.

The Japanese Akita, called Diesel, grabbed Amy Hryhoruk and clamped its jaws around her skull in a 'vice-like' grip.

Her father Simon managed to wrestle the dog off his injured daughter after sprinting out of his home when he witnessed the attack.

This Japanese Akita, called Diesel, is to be destroyed after it attacked a nine-year-old girl

The dog has been ordered to be destroyed after it injured Amy Hryhoruk and her father Simon in an attack last year

The animal had escaped from his owner's home before 'stalking' Amy as she waved goodbye to her grandmother.

Amy required 20 stitches following the incident, which happened yards from her home in Rushall, West Midlands, on May 5 last year.

Her father had two operations after suffering bites to his hands and legs.

The dog was seized by police following the attack and last Friday a judge at Wolverhampton Crown Court ordered it to be destroyed.

Nirmal Singh, 60, whose son Amrit Pal owned the dog but admitted being responsible for the animal at the time of the attack, was fined £750.

He pleaded guilty to 'allowing a dog to enter a non-public place subsequently causing an injury' contrary to the 1996 Dog Control Act. Akita’s are not on the Dangerous Dogs Act.

Singh, of Rushall, West Midlands, was ordered to pay kennel costs of £7,653.81, £1,200 court costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Ordering
the dog to be put down, Judge Michael Walsh said: 'I have absolutely no
hesitation in coming to the conclusion that Diesel is a dangerous dog 
and that he poses a significant danger to the public in the event of him
not being subject to a destruction order.'

The court heard the dog was so vicious kennel staff have been unable to examine it since it arrived 18 months ago.

Amy’s father Simon, 37, a web designer, yesterday recalled the horrific moment he watched as the dog savaged his daughter.

He said: 'I literally had just got back in the house when I saw the dog slowly approach Amy, before sprinting and jumping on her.

Mr Hryhoruk, pictured in hospital, described the ordeal as 'absolutely horrendous'

'It knocked her over flat and started mauling her.

'Luckily she had turned away. It was just like how you see a tiger hunting its prey on a David Attenborough programme.

'The ordeal was absolutely horrendous, I thought he was going to kill Amy so just jumped on him to pull him off.

'For the last 18 months we have feared
that there was the possibility that the dog would be allowed back which
scared us all, so this is a relief.'

The desperate father pulled the dog across a busy road and attempted to wrangle it into the owner’s garden.

Amy had been waving goodbye to her grandmother when the dog attacked her

Zaher Afzar, prosecuting, told the court:
'She was attacked from behind, her head was in his jaws and held there 
as if it was in a vice.'

Amy’s
grandfather Peter Hryhoruk is now calling for the law to change to mean
owners would face punishment for their dog’s actions even if they were 
not present at the time.

Mr 
Hryhoryuk, a retired Army Colonel, said: 'While we welcome this 
conviction and the punishment given we do feel sympathy for Mr Singh.

'Hundreds or thousands of dogs I have dealt with, and Diesel is one of, if not the, most dangerous I have come across' 

- PC Keith Evans

'Because of the bizarre way the law works
with dangerous dogs he has had to carry the can so to speak because his
son, who owns the dog, was not in.'

Mr Hryhoruk went on to say: 'Amy is very lucky, it could have been much much worse. She has her own retriever, so has not become afraid of dogs.

'Simon though was really scarred. It took a long time to get over the injuries and he found it hard for a long time to cope.

'He would wake up in the middle of the night terrified that someone was going to take Amy.'

PC Keith Evans, of the West Midlands Police dangerous dog unit, said: 'The chances of him [Diesel] engaging in such a horrendous attack again are just massive.

'Hundreds or thousands of dogs I have dealt with, and Diesel is one of, if not the, most dangerous I have come across.'

The dog had escaped from his owner's home (pictured) before it started 'stalking' Amy

He went on to say: 'This was a horrendous attack on a young girl and subsequently her father.

'The dog displayed a predator-link instinct and when it escaped from the house it stalked Amy. The safest thing was for it to be euthanised.'

Mr Singh refused to comment today.
