Several beaches in Perth, Australia have been shut down because of a 16ft 'monster' great white shark has been patrolling the water.

The killer shark almost forced a whale to beach on the shore as it searched for food off the coast of Western Australia.

In the dramatic footage captured by helicopter, the shark can be seen following the whale less than 100 metres from the shore.

Perth has been dubbed 'the shark attack capital of the world' after a recent upsurge in incidents.

During the period September 2011 and July 2012 there were five fatal attacks and numerous near-misses involving sharks - including the terrifying great white.

Following one attack, only the victim's damaged speedos were recovered from the ocean.

One witness told KXAN in Australia: 'First of all I saw the whale, and then I could see something following it. And then people were saying, "what's pursuing it?"

'And yea, then it was clear, it was a shark.'

Another witness claimed: 'I've never seen anything like it. It was huge.'

Surf Life Saving Western Australia said they tracked the monster beast north.

According to SLS WA most sharks in Australian waters are 'harmless' to humans.

To reduce they chance of shark attack, they advise that swimmers should avoid the water at dawn or dusk, or in river mouths.

They also suggest it is inadvisable to swim around schools of baitfish.
