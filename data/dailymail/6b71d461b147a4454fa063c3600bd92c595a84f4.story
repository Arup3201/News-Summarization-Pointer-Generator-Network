Avoidable tragedy: Gillian Astbury, 66, was admitted to Stafford Hospital in 2007 after a fall but died when nurses failed to note that she was diabetic

Scandal-hit Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust has been fined £200,000 for the 'avoidable' death of a 66-year-old diabetic who was not given insulin due to poor record-keeping.

Gillian Astbury lapsed into a fatal diabetic coma while being treated for a fractured arm and pelvis at Stafford Hospital in April 2007.

She was put under the care of a team of nurses who did not bother to read her medical notes and failed to realise she needed regular doses of insulin.

The NHS Trust, which pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety law last October, apologised for its 'dreadful' care of Mrs Astbury.

Sentencing, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave blasted the 'effectively broken' system of handovers, reiterating that the tragedy was 'wholly avoidable'.

The responsibility, he added, lay with the senior managers at the Trust, who have all since left.

He told Stafford Crown Court: 'This was a wholly avoidable and 
tragic death of a vulnerable patient who was admitted to hospital for 
care but died because of the lack of it.

'As
 repeated investigations have revealed, there was a systemic failure at 
Stafford Hospital in relation to two of the most basic tenets of patient
 care: proper hand-overs between nursing shifts, and proper 
record-keeping.

'These failures put legions of patients at Stafford Hospital at serious risk.

'The simple fact is that Mrs Astbury died because she was not given the insulin that she needed.'

The Trust was ordered to pay £200,000, plus £20,000 costs.

During the trial it emerged that there was just one senior nurse in charge of 84 beds at the time, following a cost-cutting programme by bosses.

The court heard Mrs Astbury suffered a catalogue of errors in three different wards.

She was assessed on arrival in 2007 and described as a ‘brittle’ Type-1 diabetic, who needed daily injections of insulin to control her blood sugar.

However, the chart monitoring her blood glucose level was not completed for several days, a referral to a dietician was never acted on, forms were not signed by senior staff, and the ambulance crews’ record – containing key information – was never attached to Mrs Astbury’s medical notes.

Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said responsibility for the failures lay with senior managers at the Trust.

His remarks follow a public inquiry which found the Trust 'routinely' neglected of patients between 2005 and 2009.

The judge said: 'The underlying causes of the breaches and the malaise were fundamental organisational and managerial failures, which can be traced to the very top of the organisation.'

The court heard that the hospital had undergone radical change since Mrs Astbury’s death.

The entire senior management in post at 
the time of the death no longer work at the Trust, which is set to be 
dissolved later this year.

Peter Galsworthy, the Health and Safety Eexecutive’s head of operations in the West Midlands, said: 'Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust failed to implement a proper handover system, or to oversee the proper completion of nursing records and the monitoring of care plans.

'In doing so, they put Gillian Astbury at risk.

'The Trust’s systems were simply not robust enough to ensure that staff consistently followed principles of good communication and record keeping. Gillian’s death was entirely preventable. She just needed to be given insulin.

'We expect lessons to be learned across the NHS to prevent this happening again.'

Jeff Crawshaw, deputy chief executive of Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'On behalf of the Trust, I want to again express our deepest and most sincere apologies to Mrs Astbury’s family for the unacceptable care she received at Stafford Hospital in 2007.

'Today marks the final stage in what has been a thorough and long-running investigation into the failings which led to her tragic death.

'From the very beginning, we have acknowledged the failings in Mrs Astbury’s care, and we have never shied away from our responsibility for what happened to her.

'It has been recognised by all sides in this distressing case that our Trust is a very different and much better organisation now than it was when this tragedy occurred.'
