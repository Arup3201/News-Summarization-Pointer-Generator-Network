In a move that could spell the end of high-speed car chases, joyriding, and even terrorist attacks, a UK company has created a system that can stop vehicles at the press of a button.

The RF Safe-Stop system uses blasts of electromagnetic pulses to remotely shut off any car engines that targeted by the device.

The system was created by Chelmsford-based e2v Technologies and could also be used to stop the engines in boats because it can be triggered up to 165ft away.

The RF Safe-Stop system, demonstrated in this graphic, fires electronic pulses towards a targeted car. The pulses immobilise the engine. It can be triggered at a distance of up to 165ft and police, as well as governments, have already expressed an interest in using the system

RF Safe-Stop works because the targeted 
radio frequency pulses ‘confuse’ the electronics within the car, and 
this causes the engine to cut out as a safety measure.  

The pulses travel through a wiring loom, or cable, which acts like an aerial to target where the pulses are fired.

When a car enters the field of these pulses, the engine is cut off and rolls to a halt.

As long as the car stays in this field range, the engine can't be restarted.

The radio frequencies used are from L and S parts of the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum.

These frequencies are used in weather radar equipment, for example, as well as Nasa’s Space Shuttle and International Space Station communication satellites.

E2v's current prototype, pictured, weighs around 350kg and has been fitted onto 4x4 vehicles. Future models could be designed to fit onto helicopters. The system can stop joyriders, for example, or defend buildings from terrorists driving cars fitted with bombs into the buildings

Product manager Andy Wood said as long as the car stays in this field range, the engine can't be restarted.

According to Wood, the system has already received interest from various governments and police forces and could be used as a ‘non-lethal’ weapon.

It could be used to stop joyriders, for example, or defend buildings from terrorists driving cars fitted with bombs into the buildings.

The RF Safe-Stop system could also be fitted at harbour and sea checkpoints to stop boats from entering restricted areas.

E2V’s current prototype weighs around 350kg and has been fitted onto Nissan Nevara and Toyota Land Cruisers. Future models may be designed to fit onto helicopters.
