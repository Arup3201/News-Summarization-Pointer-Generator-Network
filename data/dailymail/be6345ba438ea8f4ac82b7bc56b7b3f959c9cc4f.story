Brian Davies, 53, is one of eight thalidomide victims who have launched legal action against the manufacturers of the drug, 50 years after the birth-defect epidemic

Thalidomide victims have launched a new legal bid 50 years after the controversial morning sickness drug was prescribed to their mothers.

Papers have been filed at the High Court on behalf of eight people whose mothers took the anti-morning sickness drug when pregnant in the late 1950s and early 1960s, law firm Slater & Gordon said.

They are seeking compensation from the drug's German maker Grunenthal and Diageo, which now owns the drug's UK distributor, Distillers Co (Biochemicals).

Among those taking action is 53-year-old Brian Davies, from Gwynedd in Wales.

He was born with severe defects of both legs, his left ends in a stump while his right leg has just two toes.

The HGV driver says his condition has left him in constant pain, which is gradually getting worse as his legs and skin weaken over time.

Despite being born with a number of known thalidomide symptoms at the peak of the birth-defect epidemic, Mr Davies has never received compensation.

The 
married father-of-two said: 'I’m very angry at the way I, and others 
like me, have been treated over the years. I have never really been 
given any support yet my disabilities have meant my life has been very 
difficult.

'I’m not 
the sort of person to let life get the better of me so I have made the 
most of it, I go to work and I am proud that I provide for my family. 
But it has been hard.

'I
 have to wear a prosthetic leg and suffer constant pain in my legs, hips
 and back. I worry that the pain will keep getting worse and stop me 
from doing my job.'

Mr
 Davies was told in the 1970s that because his condition only affected 
his legs and not his arms that he would not be recognised as a 
thalidomide survivor.

He
 said: 'I know I am luckier than many as I still have my arms but that 
does not mean I should have been ignored. It’s a disgrace that so many 
people have been denied justice in this way.

'In
 my eyes it was simply the drug companies looking to save money and 
ignoring the duty of care they have to people whose lives they have 
ruined.

'Ever since I 
was a child I have missed out on everyday pleasures, like playing 
football with friends or swimming, things other people take for granted.

'Everyday
 I am in pain and every day is a struggle. I hope that now we finally 
get the justice that we have been demanding for so many years.'

Between 1958 and 1961 the drug Thalidomide was used by expectant mothers to control symptoms of morning sickness.

It was originally prescribed as a 'wonder drug' for morning sickness, headaches, coughs, insomnia and colds.

Thalidomide babies often suffered missing or deformed limbs and extreme shortening of arms and legs, but the drug also caused malformations of the eyes and ears, genitals, heart, kidneys and digestive tract.

Thalidomide was developed by German pharmaceutical company Chemie Grunenthal.

It was first launched in October 1957 in Germany and in the UK in 1958 under the name Distaval.

Between 1958 and 1961 the drug was used by expectant mothers to control the symtoms of morning sickness.

As many as 10,000 babies across the world were born with deformities.

Babies were born with missing or deformed limbs, extreme shortening of arms and legs.

The drug was also found to cause malformations of the eyes and ears, genitals, heart, kidneys and digestive tract.

Manufacturers withdrew the drug in November 1961 after reports of what amounted to an epidemic of births and malformed babies.

UK marketeres Distillers (Biochemicals) Ltd, followed suit the following month.

A UK Government warning was issued in May 1962.

By the time safety fears led to it being pulled from sale thousands of babies worldwide had been affected.

According to survivors' charity Thalidomide UK there are still 455 victims in the UK but it is estimated around 40% of victims died before their first birthday.

In 2012 Grunenthal apologised for the drug for the first time, with chief executive Harald Stock saying 'we have been silent and we are very sorry for that'.

Last year Diageo paid 89 million Australian dollars (£49 million) to just over 100 further Australians damaged by the drug, in a deal which led to a claim against Grunenthal being discontinued.

Slater & Gordon lawyer Fraser Whitehead said: 'Grunenthal and Distillers have always claimed that the thalidomide disaster was an unavoidable tragedy and that they did everything expected of drug companies at the time.

'Our research has demonstrated that is nonsense.

'Both companies knew their drug was causing severe nerve damage and both were explicitly warned of the possibility thalidomide might cause severe malformations.

'Yet the drug was left on the market for many months afterwards.

'It is time those responsible are finally held to account for the mistakes of the past. Grunenthal, in particular, has done little make good the immense damage that it has done and it has to accept responsibility for those affected in the UK.'

A Grunenthal spokesman said: 'Grunenthal confirms that the company received an email from Slater & Gordon today, announcing that they have been instructed to bring proceedings on behalf of eight claimants.

'Grunenthal has not seen the claims to which they refer and is, therefore, not in a position to comment further.'
