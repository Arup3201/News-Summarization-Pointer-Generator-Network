Tragic: Autumn Elgersma, 3, died from head injuries after being 'thrown to the floor' by a woman running a daycare centre

A childminder has been charged with murdering a three-year-old because the little girl 'refused to take her coat off'.

Rochelle Lynn Sapp, 33, is accused of throwing Autumn Elgersma down with such force it fractured her skull.

The Orange City youngster, died in November from her head injuries after two days in hospital.

But police have now charged Sapp with first-degree murder and child endangerment resulting in death.

The
tragedy unfolded at 10th Street SE, in eastern Orange City, the home of
Sapp, where she ran a daycare centre, according to police.

Sapp
had initially claimed Autumn had fallen down some stairs but later 
admitted she had attacked the youngster, a senior police officer has 
said.

Autumn's parents Phillip and Jennifer paid an emotional tribute to their beloved daughter at the time of her death.

‘Autumn was a joy in our lives and we are blessed to have called her ours.

'We take comfort in the fact that she is now with her Savior, Jesus Christ.’

Court documents say Sapp called the girl’s mother shortly after 9am and told her Autumn had fallen down the stairs.

Sioux
County Attorney Coleman McAllister said: 'In this case the initial 
charges were based on the medical evidence and opinion available to the 
state at that time.

'Upon 
Autumn's death, the circumstances changed.

'The medical examiner's office
in Des Moines took time to make sure they did a thorough and complete 
examination and we like everybody else was waiting for them to render an
opinion for us to evaluate so we could move forward with charges.'

Sapp was placed in Sioux County Jail while the investigation into the incident was investigated.

She is due to appear a judge and a bond was set at $250,000, according to Mr McAllister.

According
to Orange City Police Chief, Jim Pottebaum, Sapp told detectives that 
she threw the girl to the floor after she refused to take off her coat.
