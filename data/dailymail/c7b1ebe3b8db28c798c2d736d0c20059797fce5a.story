An infant has become infected with measles after his parents took him to Disneyland, the site believed to be at the center of a recent outbreak caused by unvaccinated children.

Ariel and Christopher Loop, from Pasadena, California, took their baby Mobius to the theme park in Anaheim in mid-January, thinking that problems with measles publicized in December had been fixed.

The Southern California amusement center is thought to be the source of an outbreak that has affected 122 people.

The sudden emergence of the disease is concerning -it was officially eliminated from the United States in 2000 due to widespread vaccination programs against it.

The Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine (MMR) is normally not administered to children until they are one year old.

Mrs Loop, a registered nurse, was having trouble putting Mobius, named after the mathematical shape, to bed when the child first showed signs of having measles, according to CBS LA.

'And then the next morning when he woke up, he was super hot and he had the bumps on his chest and the back of his head,' she said.

The family rushed to the hospital, where they were put into a special negative-pressure room. 

Tests confirmed that Mobius had measles, and had been contagious for four days before he and his parents entered quarantine.

Disneyland in Anaheim, California, is thought to be the center of a measles outbreak that has affected more than 120 people 

Mrs Loop, a registered nurse, said that her child may have exposed hundreds to the disease before the family was quarantined for eight days

'We went out to eat twice, ran countless errands, and have potentially infected other kids who are too young to have to go through this. That kills me. And might kill one of them,' his mother said on Facebook.

She estimated that hundreds of children could have been exposed to the disease during the short time. 

Mobius's story went viral and attracted the attention of anti-vaccine advocates, who say that the immunizations are harmful and may cause autism, despite a lack of hard scientific evidence.

Mr Loop responded to the the critics by saying he was focusing on treating his son, who had 'a hacking cough that would put many smokers with a cold to shame'.

A family friend, Dr Donavan Freberg, said that 'The completely illogical and deeply paranoid fears of the anti-vaxxers who selfishly put Mobius at risk.'

Large measles outbreaks in recent years have been linked to populations that have not received the MMR vaccine

Mrs Loop was also on watch for possible pneumonia during her child's battle with the disease.

The family was in quarantine for the eight days leading up to Monday, during which Mobius made a full recovery. 

'I understand that vaccines are scary. Having to hold him tight while a stranger hurts him is hard. Having three people hold him still to get the blood to test him for measles, however, was infinitely harder,' Mrs Loop said.

A Center for Disease Control statement said that it has been dealing with a large, ongoing multi-state outbreak since the beginning of the year.

Though the vast majority of cases are in California, 18 states and Washington DC had seen cases as of Tuesday. 

Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington have seen patients with measles.

Political figures have weighed in on the issue of vaccination, with President Barack Obama saying that there is 'no reason' for all parents not to have their children immunized. 

The year 2014 saw a record number of measles cases, with 644 patients across 27 states. 

Last year had one major outbreak that consisted of 383 cases in the unvaccinated Ohio Amish community.

The US normally sees less than 100 measles cases a year.

The majority of measles cases have been in California. The CDC has updated its information on the disease's spread and now 18 states are affected
