Two motorists who mowed down and 
killed a 13-year-old schoolgirl during a dangerous 81mph 'game of chase'
 were today facing jail today.

Amy Hofmeister died when a speeding 
Vauxhall Vectra hit a curb, flipped over and ploughed into her and a 
friend as they rode their bikes in a cycle lane.

Vectra driver Leonard Jones, 42, and 
his girlfriend Leanne Burnell, 21, were racing at 50mph over the speed 
limit when the accident happened.

Jones had just overtaken his partner's Ford Focus when the crash happened.

He had previously admitted causing Amy’s death by dangerous driving but Burnell had denied the same charge.

After a four-day trial at Taunton 
Crown Court, a jury of seven men and five women took just three hours 
and 25 minutes to find her guilty of death by dangerous driving.

Burnell showed no emotion as the jury foreman returned the verdict.

Adjourning sentencing for reports, Judge Graham Hume Jones told Burnell: 'You have to come back to court to be sentenced.

'You will be told when to attend court so you must keep in contact with your solicitor.

'You will be given bail.'

The pair started the high-speed game -
 which forced other drivers to swerve to avoid being hit - after Jones 
yelled 'I'll catch her, I'll catch her' to a friend, a jury was told.

He later admitted causing death by 
dangerous driving, but his girlfriend Burnell denied the same charge and
 went on trial at Taunton Crown Court today.

However, William Hunter, prosecuting, told the court that Burnell was also instrumental in causing the accident.

He said: 'She was effectively encouraging Leonard Jones to drive dangerously by egging him on smiling and smirking at him.'

Describing what happened, Mr Hunter 
added: 'Just over a year ago to the day 13-year-old Amy Hofmeister was 
with her friend Lucy Hawkins, riding their bicycles on a cycle path.

'A Vauxhall Vectra mounted the pavement and overturned, hitting both cyclists. Amy Hofmeister was killed.

'The Vauxhall Vectra was Leonard Jones'. He has pleaded guilty to the death of Amy Hofmeister by dangerous driving.

'He was driving too fast because, the prosecution say, he was playing a high-speed game of chase - or racing - with another car.

'He was winning that game. He had just overtaken that other car. That Ford Focus was being driven by the defendant.

'The prosecution's case is that by 
playing this high speed, dangerous game on a built up road, where the 
speed limit is 30mph, Amy Hofmeister was killed.

'The defendant was playing games with Leonard Jones and is jointly responsible for the death.'

Taunton Crown Court was told that 
Amy, who dreamed of becoming a school teacher, died in the collision on 
Blackbrook Way, in Taunton, Somerset, on June 15 last year.

Her friend Lucy Hawkins was also injured, but survived.

The jury was told that Jones and 
Burnell, both from Taunton, had gone to eat at the nearby Harvester pub 
at around 5pm - leaving just before the crash.

Witnesses described seeing Burnell speed off in her Ford Focus, with Jones and friend Larry Grant following behind the Vectra.

CCTV pictures showed the cars 
accelerating out of a Murco garage, next-door to the Harvester, before 
entering a bus lane and careering down the road.

Witness Sharon Symonds described the two cars as 'playing games with each other', the court heard.

Mr Hunter told the jury: 'She says 
she saw the defendant turn around to the car behind her and smirk - 
showing, the prosecution says, that they were playing games with each 
other.'

The cars continued to race down the 
road, crossing a roundabout before turning onto Blackbrook way, where 
Jones overtook the Ford Focus, the court heard.

Oncoming driver Tina Beckhurst later 
told police she was forced to slow down and swerve out of the way, as 
Jones passed the Ford Focus on a bend.

Vectra passenger Larry Grant, giving 
evidence, told the court the car reached 80mph in the 'chase' and 
estimated Burnell's Focus would have been travelling at around 60mph.

The witness, who was also injured in 
the crash, said Jones had told him 'I'll catch her, I'll catch her' as 
he sped towards Burnell.

He said: 'I told him to slow down. I was panicking because of the speed he was driving - it was reckless.

'We hit the curb and flipped over. I cant recall seeing anything.'

Accused: Leanne Burnell, 21, leaves Taunton Crown Court today. She was playing a 'high speed, dangerous game' on a 30mph road when a 13-year-old girl was killed, the prosecution said

Jones was arrested at the scene - but lied to police and told them another friend, who had fled, was driving.

Burnell was arrested later that evening and also lied to the police.

She claimed to have only been travelling at between 20 to 25mph and had not gone on the same route as her boyfriend.

Burnell also said that Jones was speeding but her car was 'chugging' as it was low on fuel.

Recalling the crash, she said: 'It all happened so fast. He was overtaking me. I’d slowed right down to let him get in front because of a vehicle coming on facing us.

'He got back in front of me, which is when the accident happened where he hit the kerb.

'His car rolled. I panicked, I was in shock. I pulled up my car and put my hazards on. I ran to the Vectra. I couldn’t see nothing. I ran for help.”

Burnell denied racing Jones and said he and his passenger were 'acting like idiots” by speeding up behind her and then slowing down.

Jones, of Mulberry Close, Taunton, was not in court and remains in custody.

Burnell, of Bishop’s Hull, also Taunton, was released on bail.

Both will be sentenced later on a date to be fixed.
