End of the road: Nigel Farage said he would quit as UKIP leader if Britain votes to stay in the EU

Nigel Farage has revealed he will quit politics if Britain votes to stay in the European Union in 2017.

The UKIP leader said the campaign to cut ties with Brussels would go on forever if the referendum goes against him.

But he would have ‘have probably reached the end of the road’ for his own political ambitions.

David Cameron has pledged to stage an in-out referendum by 2017 if he is Prime Minister after the next election.

The Tory leader wants to renegotiate a fresh settlement, returning some powers to London, and has indicated he would campaign to stay in the EU.

Polls suggest the result could be close, but with a small majority preferring to remain not to leave.

If that was the result in four years’ time, Mr Farage suggested he would walk away from politics.

He said: ‘For the overall cause, no free country ever willingly gives up the right to govern itself and the independence argument won't die but it will have been put back for a long time.

‘Personally, I would have probably reached the end of the road. If we reach that point in 2017, I will have been doing this a long time and if I haven't succeeded then I haven't succeeded,’ he told Public Service Europe.

However Mr Farage insisted the debate in the run up to the referendum would see an increase in support for leaving the EU.

‘I genuinely think that a referendum on this subject would be just like the debate on whether we should join the euro.

‘The more air and the more publicity it gets, the more likely it would be that our side of the argument would win.’

Mr Farage first became leader of UKIP in 2006, but quit in 2009 to stand for Parliament in the 2010 general election.

His bid to oust Commons Speaker John Bercow as an MP failed, after he dramatically survived a plane crash while campaigning on polling day.

After a dire general election campaign under Lord Pearson, the party re-elected Mr Farage as leader in November 2010.

Since then the party has seen a surge in support, leap-frogging the Lib Dems in the polls and winning one in four votes in local elections in May this year.

Now the party is predicting it could win elections to the European Parliament in 2014, before trying to secure its first MPs a year later.

However this week the party has faced fresh accusations of racism after UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom complained about Britain sending foreign aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’.

He offered up several explanations to prove the comment it was not racist.

Yesterday he insisted that a bongo is a ‘white antelope, lives in the forest, there is no connotation of racism about it whatsoever’.

Critics were quick to point out that the bongo antelope is not white, it is brown.

Earlier he said: ‘I don’t know where Ruritania is either – there is no such place of course is there? Like the Third World. Where is the Third World?’

And he suggested: ‘It might have been misconstrued by President Bongo of the Gambon, he may have thought I was talking about him.

‘If he is offended, I shall write to his excellency in short order and say, “I’m very sorry I wasn’t talking about you”.'

However, Ali Bongo is president of Gabon, not Gambon.

Repeatedly quizzed on whether he is a racist, Mr Bloom told Channel 4 News interviewer Krishnan Guru-Murthy: ‘Move on, there’s a good fellow. If you’re not going to move on to serious issues, I’m not going to continue – I can’t be bothered with it.’

He then tore off his earpiece and stormed off.
