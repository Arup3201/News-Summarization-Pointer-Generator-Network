Tangled web: Tailblah Assoua is accused of pretending she married her husband's twin brother - a French citizen - so she could claim benefits

An Ivorian woman duped UK authorities and a vicar into thinking she had married her husband’s twin brother to fraudulently claim benefits, a court heard today.

Tailblah Assoua, 34, formed a relationship Laurent Atte Aka, a man she had known in the Ivory Coast when she was still of school age, when she illegally came to the UK in 2002.

Laurent was also in the country illegally and used his twin brother Barnard's identity because he was married to a French 
woman and was able to stay in Europe.

Assoua then became pregnant with Laurent's child but used his brother's details to register their daughter's birth.

The pair then wed in in Plymouth, Devon, in 2006 by using the details of Laurent's brother.

Prosecutor Brian Fitzherbert said Assoua used the French citizenship from the fake marriage to get a European Economic Area residence card and a National Insurance number.

He told Plymouth Crown Court: 'She would not have been entitled to benefits without a National Insurance number.

'Her entitlement was based on the fact that her husband was an EU national.'

Mr Fitzherbert said Assoua’s offences spanned six years between 2003 and 2009.

He said she had lied about fleeing persecution and a polygamous marriage to an 'old man' in a village in her native Ivory Coast when she first approached the Home Office for permission to stay in the UK in April 2003.

Assoua, who was pregnant, had claimed the child was the old man’s when, in fact, it was her husband’s.

Mr Fitzherbert said: 'She claimed she had begun her journey from her village in March 2003.

'She claimed she had flown to Britain via France but couldn’t say which British airport she had flown into.

'She claimed she used a passport that a friend had bought her. She said that passport was given to a lady who she couldn’t name when she got to the airport.

'She was then put on a bus to Exeter.'

Mr Fitzherbert said Assoua had 'perhaps understandably' been desperate to get approval to stay in the UK as she had 'no legal status to remain and was three months pregnant'.

He said: 'She made a clumsy attempt to dupe the authorities.'

He added that her defence was that she 'genuinely believed Laurent was Auguste'.

But Assoua’s husband Laurent told the court that they first met in Exeter in August 2002 - months before she told immigration officers she had arrived.

Mr Fitzherbert asked Laurent where he and Assoua had spent Christmas in 2004 and he said they were together at his sister’s in London.

Asked how his sister referred to him at this gathering he replied indignantly: 'Laurent'.

Assoua, of Plymouth, is charged with seeking to remain in the country by deception, possessing false identity documents with intent, forgery of a registrar’s record, possession of an article for use in fraud, namely a national insurance card, and four counts of fraud against the city council.

She denies all charges.

The trial continues.
