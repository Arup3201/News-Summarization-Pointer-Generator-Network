Britons are being advised to stay away from Kenyan coastal areas near the Somali border after a French woman was kidnapped by pirates following a fierce gun battle.

Disabled Marie Dedieu was snatched from a beach resort in the Lamu archipelago, northern Kenya, by ten heavily armed Somali militants after a gunfight with local police.

On September 11, Briton David Tebbutt, 
58, was killed and his wife Judith, 56, abducted by armed gunmen from a 
resort near the popular tourist town of Lamu.

Ms Dedieu's Kenyan boyfriend John Lepapa, 39, said the gang marched the staff off at gunpoint, then one man lifted the 66-year-old on to his shoulders and carried her to a motorboat

The foreign office statement read: 'We advise against all but essential 
travel to coastal areas within 150km of the Somali border, following two
attacks by armed gangs in small boats against beach resorts in the Lamu
area on 11 September and 1 October 2011.

'This advice will be kept under review. Both attacks were on beach-front
properties, with two Westerners kidnapped and one murdered.

'Beach-front accommodation in that area and boats off the coast are vulnerable.'

The Tebbutts, from Bishop's Stortford, were the only guests at the 
Kiwayu Safari Village, 25 miles from the Kenya-Somalia border.

Security forces yesterday tracked down 
and surrounded the pirate boat believed to be carrying the French 
hostage.

Several of the masked Somalis were 
wounded in the battle, which followed their boat being surrounded by 
coastguard vessels and an aircraft in a stand-off as France and Kenya 
tried to save Dedie.

The FCO said its travel advice is 'under constant review in the light of the situation on the ground'.

'Travel advice is based on objective 
assessments of the risk to British nationals, whose safety is our main 
concern,' said the statement.

Last night two aircraft were pursuing 
the kidnappers into Somalia as fears grew for Ms Dedieu, who now has no 
medication to combat her illness.

The kidnap took place 30 miles from the beach near the Kenyan-Somali 
border where Briton Judith Tebbutt, 56, was seized by gunmen last month.

She was taken by six men who burst into her beach-front 
bungalow which she rents for half the year on Manda Island at 3am.

The island is located across the channel from the tourist town of Lamu.

Her Kenyan boyfriend John Lepapa, 39, 
said the gang marched the staff off at gunpoint, then one man lifted 
66-year-old Ms Dedieu on to his shoulders and carried her to the gang’s 
motorboat.

The couple had returned two days earlier from France, where 
they spend part of the year.

Tebbutt

Mr Lepapa said the gang fired assault rifles into the air as they came 
ashore and shouted: ‘Where is the foreigner? Where is the foreigner?’ as
they burst into her sleeping quarters.

He said: ‘She pleaded with them to take things, even money, and spare 
her life. But they would not listen.’

He said he and Ms Dedieu, who uses
a wheelchair, had planned to marry.

Three weeks ago social worker Judith Tebbutt, from Bishop’s Stortford, 
Hertfordshire, was snatched in a speedboat by Somali pirates who shot 
dead her husband David, 57, a publishing finance director.

Mrs Tebbutt 
is now believed to be held in the northern Amara area of Somalia. No 
contact has been established with her kidnappers and no ransom demanded.

Last night, Kenyan authorities said that despite a gun battle, pirates 
had escaped into Somalia with Ms Dedieu. Several of the abductors were 
wounded.

‘They’ve crossed the border into Ras Kamboni. There are two aircraft on 
top of them monitoring their position,’ said Kenyan tourism minister 
Najib Balala.

‘We can see that a few of the kidnappers are injured. They are 15 miles from our border.’

The UN has ruled that foreign military forces can pursue pirates in 
Somalia.

Before the gunfight, Mr Balala said two coastguard vessels had 
surrounded the pirates’ motorboat carrying Ms Dedieu and a military 
aircraft was circling overhead.

‘Our fear was that if we drowned the boat, we would also drown the woman,’ he said.

Locals on Manda Island and nearby Lamu, exclusive holiday destinations 
for wealthy Euro¬peans, said they believed Ms Dedieu was specifically 
targeted.

Abdallah Satilli, the owner of her rented house, said she had been using
it as a holiday home for eight years. H

She said: ‘I was woken by gunfire,
maybe two shots. At first I prayed and then I tried to go back to sleep
but there was such a commotion across the water that I took a boat over
there and realised she was gone.’

France said it was ‘working with the Kenyan authorities, which have 
mobilised significant air and sea resources in order to free our 
compatriot’.

Colonel John Steed, in charge of the UN’s counter-piracy unit in 
Nairobi, said: ‘Now it is dark it is next to impossible to continue to 
follow – the moment is lost. It reverts to normal kidnapping 
negotiations.’

The UN’s envoy to Somalia, Augustine Mahiga, warned last week of a 
growing link between Somalia’s pirates and militants. Much of southern 
Somalia is controlled by the Al Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabaab group.

‘Al-Shabaab gives the pirates their required speed and safe passage,’ he
said. ‘Judith Tebbutt’s abduction illustrated this. She had been taken 
to the al-Shabaab stronghold port of Kismayo and then driven up to the 
pirates’ area in the north.’
