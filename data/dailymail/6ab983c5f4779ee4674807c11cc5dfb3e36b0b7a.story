Some of the messages are amusing slogans but most are filled with a lonely despair only felt by a soldier experiencing the bloody horrors of war.

These rather personal epigrams were engraved on to the side of the Zippo lighters of US soldiers, sailors and airmen during the Vietnam War.

A collection of 282 lighters offering a rare insight into the mindset of military personnel fighting in the conflict was recently sold at auction for almost £22,000.

Epigrams: A collection of Zippo lighters with the engravings of US servicemen who fought in Vietnam have been auctioned for almost £20,000

Keepsakes: The lighters were all collected by Bradford Edwards from the streets of Ho Chi Minh during the 1990s

Poignant: While some of the lighters contain amusing one liners, the markings on others give a real insight into the loneliness of serving at war

The lighters were collected by American artist Bradford Edwards during the 1990s who bought them off the streets of Ho Chi Minh City.

Among the inscriptions is a lighter that reads: 'When I die I'll go to heaven because I've spent my time in hell.'

Another reads: 'When the power to love overcomes the love of power only then will there be a chance for true peace.'

One simply reads: 'To mom, from a lonely paratrooper, Tony.'

Collection: Bradford initially used the lighters to create unique works of art but says that the collection took on a life of its own

Big business: Because of a surge in interest in souvenirs from Vietnam, there is now a big market for fake lighters, says Bradford

Profound: Some of the messages carried by the lighters are more serious than others

Another says: 'A sucking chest wound is nature's way of telling you you've been ambushed.'

Bradford initially used them to create various works of art, but says that his collection eventually took on a life of their own.

He said: 'I'm fascinated with the lighters as 
they are a window into the minds and experiences of the men experiencing
 a certain place and time.

'I had used the lighters as inspiration and media in my art, but the collection itself has grown to be a statement of its own.'

Over the years Bradford says he has handled thousands of genuine Vietnam Zippos.

Enthusiast: Bradford says that he has handled hundreds of the lighters over the years

Kit: The lighters were often used as part of day to day combat with certain tasks becoming known as Zippo missions

Service: Many of the lighters include the years in which their owners served in Vietnam and their platoon

But an increasing demand from foreign tourists for mementos has led to a growing number of fake items entering the market.

Bradford said: 'There are no real Zippos in Vietnam now. The scene is over. '

Used for lighting cigarettes, heating food, illuminating letters from home, or setting fire to huts of suspected Viet Cong, Zippos were used so frequently in search and destroy missions that GIs nicknamed them 'Zippo Missions' or 'Zippo Raids.'

The Vietnam War, which ran from 1959 to 1975, was a bloody Cold War-era conflict that claimed millions of lives and left countless soldiers and natives traumatised by what they had endured.

Bloody: Soldiers in action during the Vietnam War. The war raged from 1959 until 1975

Brutal: U.S. estimates claim that between 200,000 and 250,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed and more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers died or were missing in action when the final troops pulled out

America's involvement in the region was triggered by one belief: that Communism was threatening to expand across the whole of South-East Asia.

The Hanoi government estimate that in 20 years of fighting, four million civilians were killed across North and South Vietnam and a further 1.1million communist fighters died.

U.S. estimates claim that between 200,000 and 250,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed and more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers died or were missing in action when the final troops pulled out.

The war itself gathered heavy opposition in the States and soldiers have since recalled being told by superiors to remove their uniforms before landing back home to avoid being accosted by campaigners.

Vietnam finally normalised relations with the U.S. in 1995.
