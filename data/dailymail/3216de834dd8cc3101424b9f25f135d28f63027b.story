A British holidaymaker who chipped in with friends to buy £200-worth of cocaine while on a skiing holiday collapsed and died after snorting the super-strength powder.

Nina Holmes, 33, was heard telling her friends 'this stuff is strong' moments before she collapsed while partying in the Bulgarian ski resort of Borovets, described as 'like Ibiza but with snow'. 

Miss Holmes, from Swansea, Wales, was on holiday with her long-term boyfriend Dean Herbert, 29, and their friends when she overdosed in February last year.

Nina Holmes, 33, chipped in with friends to buy £200 of cocaine while on holiday in Bulgaria, but collapsed after snorting it and saying 'this is strong'

An inquest at Swansea Coroner's Court today heard that Miss Holmes and Mr Herbert were regular users of cocaine - and had taken it at weekends since their relationship began in 2012.

However, by last year the pair had 'cut down' on their drug use and were only snorting it 'once every six weeks'.

On the third day of their holiday the pair went drinking to a bar called BJ's along with seven other friends after a day's skiing.

The group, who had been to the resort once before, were drinking together when several members paid £200 for five bags of cocaine from a club rep named 'Stella'.

However, they became worried because rather than the white, powdered drug they had been expecting to buy, the substance they were given looked brownish green and grainy.

Despite this Miss Holmes took a bag for herself, and according to friends described the effects as 'banging' and 's*** hot'.

Witnesses said she became 'euphoric' and began laughing and dancing, but before long Mr Herbert noticed she was unsteady on her feet.

He tried to take her outside into the fresh air, but before he reached the door she was unconscious.

He told the inquest: 'I was at the bar and I knew Nina was getting the drugs but I didn’t see it.

'I saw that Nina was unsteady on her feet and I helped her out and then she was unconscious.'

Her friend Emma Roberts added: 'Nina gave me a clear impression that she had taken the substance but it didn’t look like what it should.

'She called out to me and when I approached her she collapsed. She was carried outside and put on a table and she was unconscious all the time. I tried to wake her up but I couldn’t.'

The emergency services were called, but by that time eight other Britons who took drugs from the same batch had also collapsed.

Paul Finley, who was with Nina, said: 'It didn’t look like cocaine but I still decided to use it.

'I rolled it in a note and snorted half a bag. It was a lot stronger than normal cocaine. I felt it getting stronger and stronger. At first I felt good but then I started panicking a bit. 

'I had to sit down and I was really weak and I just collapsed. I lost the ability to move my arms and legs and when I was taken to the medical centre I collapsed again.'

Paramedics were able to save eight of the party, but they were unable to revive Miss Holmes.

Pathologist Dr Maurizio Brotto said she died of a heart attack brought on by poisoning caused by a combination of cocaine and alcohol.

The inquest heard how Miss Holmes drank beers, vodka and coca cola, and shots before she decided to snort the drug and collapsed.

Bulgarian police arrested a woman at the time on suspicion of providing the drugs and they are still investigating. British police are no longer involved in the case and are not seeking charges.

An inquest at Swansea Crown Court heard today that Miss Holmes and her friends were concerned about the drugs they had bought because they did not look like cocaine, but decided to take them anyway

Miss Holmes had been drinking vodka drinks, shots and beers before taking the drugs, and a pathologist today revealed she died of a heart attack brought on by the toxic mix of chemicals in her system

Miss Holmes' body was flown back from Bulgaria by Mr Herbert. Her parents were away on holiday in the Caribbean when they were told of the her death and flew home immediately.

Nina lived with her parents and sister in a luxury caravan on land where the family store traditional fairground rides and amusements which they rent out to events all over the country. 

The inquest heard that Miss Holmes had grown up helping to run the family business. She had been dating Mr Herbert for several years and friends said they were a 'lovely couple'.

Swansea assistant coroner Paul Bennett recorded a conclusion of death by misadventure.

He said: 'Nina thought it was cocaine and took the decision to use it. It was part of a social gathering and the intention was to enjoy themselves by partaking of this particular drug.

'It is unclear what the packet held, but I am satisfied that whatever it was it contained cocaine, whether it also contained unadulterated substances or not.'
