The famously conservative Joe Scarborough shockingly said on Monday that the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut have forced him to rethink his ‘long-held’ believes about the right to bear arms.

The former Republican congressman said he spoke ‘with a heavy heart and no easy answers,’ but ‘the ideologies of my past career were no longer relevant for the future that I demand for my children.’

The result of his ten-minute monologue was one demanding a rapid and utter change in gun control laws, as it is now about public safety and the safety of America’s citizens.

Things must change: Speaking Monday on 'Morning Joe,' Joe Scarborough said that the past laws are no longer good enough to protect America's citizens

Conservative: A Republican, Scarborough said that Friday's elementary school shooting 'changed everything' in terms of gun control

Scarborough gave his powerful speech on Monday’s episode of ‘Morning Joe,’ telling the audience that Friday’s shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in the once-idyllic New England town ‘changed everything.’

‘Let this be our true landmark. Politicians can no longer be allowed to defend the status quo.

'They must instead be forced to defend our children,’ he said, adding that several factors of this particular shooting resonated deeply with him – including that one of his sons has Asperger’s Syndrome, and that his children are about the age of many of Sandy’s victims.

‘Friday changed everything. It must change everything,’ Scarborough said, noting the shootings in Aurora, Virginia Tech, and Portland, Oregon.

After each prior shooting, Scarborough said, he took a libertarian’s approach to ‘Hollywood’s First Amendment rights and gun collectors’ Second Amendment rights.’

But, he continued, that had to change. ‘I say good luck to the gun lobbyists, good luck to the Hollywood lawyer who tries to hide behind twisted readings of our Bill of Rights.

Change of heart: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she would support legislation banning assault weapons after previously throwing cold water on the idea

‘The battle we now must fight and the battle we have to win is for the safety of your children and mine.’

Scarborough has joined an increasing chorus of previously pro-gun pundits who have since experienced a paradigm shift in the wake of Sandy Hook.

'Friday changed everything. It must change everything.'

Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Virginia Senator Mark Warner, both Democrats who have earned top marks from the powerful National Rifle Association, said they would now be open to more regulation of military-style rifles like the one used to kill 20 young children and six adults on Friday.

And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she would support legislation banning assault weapons after previously throwing cold water on the idea.

'The voices of reason cannot be silent,' she said on the House floor late on Monday. 

'Through administrative and legislative action, we must limit the proliferation of weapons and ammunition that have no other purpose than to kill citizens.'

U.S. lawmakers have not approved a major new federal gun law since 1994, and a ban on certain semi-automatic rifles known as assault weapons expired in 2004.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who authored the previous ban, pledged to introduce legislation early next year to ban the weapons.

Previous attempts at toughening U.S. gun laws have failed amid opposition from the NRA and other gun-lobby groups - even after mass shootings across the country.

But the shift by moderate Democrats showed that the weapons lobby could face a tougher fight this time to ward off calls for more regulation.

However, with Congress and President Obama busy trying to resolve the 'fiscal cliff' of tax and spending deadlines, even liberal Democrats acknowledge that any review of gun laws would not take place until 2013.

A hunter and member of the National Rifle Association, Manchin said the availability of such high-powered weapons does not make sense, and that he knew of no hunter who went out with assault rifles or clips with 30 rounds of ammunition.

'This awful massacre of our youngest children has changed us, and everything should be on the table,' said Manchin, who once ran a campaign ad in which he shot environmental legislation with a rifle.
