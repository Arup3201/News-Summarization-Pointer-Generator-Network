In 2014 many people will be seeking a date for Valentine's Day via dating websites and smart phone apps.

Gone are the days when women had to wait to be asked to dance at a stately hall ball or seek their father's approval on whether a man was rich enough to take their hand in marriage.

Back when Jane Austen was penning her novels in 19th century England, a woman's reputation was everything and finding a husband was imperative.

But while many of the traditions from that time have changed, there's still a lot that modern day daters can learn from their literary heroines...

Timeless: Modern women can still learn from Jane Austen's stories which are no longer just books but films and TV series too

We all know that first impressions count on a first date but don't be too quick to judge. In Pride and Prejudice Mr Darcy dismisses Lizzie Bennett as 'barely tolerable' and 'not handsome enough to tempt me' after their first meeting but soon realises the error of his ways once he gets to know her.

Our friends may have our best interests at heart but they don't always make the ideal matchmakers. A man they deem to be your perfect match could actually be the opposite. 

This is proved in the novel, Emma, when the book's heroine Emma Woodhouse convinces her friend Harriet Smith that farmer Robert Martin isn't the man for her and she should reject his proposal. 

She instead encourages her to pursue the gentleman  Mr Elton but this ends in tears when he reveals he doesn't have feelings for her. If only Harriet had followed her heart. As Austen writes: 'You must be the best judge of your own happiness.' 

But keep your friends close as you will certainly need them as you negotiate the dating scene as Austen observes in Northanger Abbey: 'Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.'

Wasn't love at first sight: But the path of true love ran smoothly for Mr Darcy and Lizzy Bennett in the end in Pride and Prejudice

Too good to be true: Online daters have to be wary of boastful profiles

When online dating, it's not easy to know if you can believe someone is who they really say they are when they boast of their riches and good-looks on their profile.

Unfortunately, it was the same in Austen's day and men who seemed too good to be true usually were. She illustrates this in the character of Mr Wickham in Pride and Prejudice, a charming soldier who makes a wonderful impression on everyone he meets and seems like the perfect catch.

However, he turns out to be untrustworthy after it is revealed he gambled away his inheritance and nearly ruins the reputation of Lydia Bennett by convincing her to elope with him. He had no intention of making her an 'honest woman' by marrying her but is forced to do so by Mr Darcy.

Wise words: Author Jane Austen

Hands up if you've been guilty of rejecting someone just because they weren't an inch taller, didn't earn enough money or shared your love of your favourite film. While it's fine to have standards, being too fussy could prevent you from finding true love.

Mr Darcy shows he was being a bit too picky when he declares in Pride and Prejudice that he is looking for an 'accomplished woman' who 'must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.'

Marianne Dashwood also fears she will never meet a man to meet her high standards in Sense and Sensibility when she declares: 'Mama, the more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much!'

She adds: 'I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own. He must enter in all my feelings; the same books, the same music must charm us both.'

Looking for such a Mr Right could leave you single for a long time.

In Sense and Sensibility, the wise Elinor cautions her younger sister Marianne not to get carried away with her feelings for Mr Willoughby after he comes to her rescue.

Elinor advises her to be more prudent: 'Pray, pray be composed, and do not betray what you feel to every body present.'

But Marianne doesn't listen and gets caught up in a whirlwind romance before having her heart broken.    

Fools rush in: Marianne in Sense and Sensibility, played by Kate Winslet in the film, listened to her heart over her head

In Mansfield Park, after being rejected by Mr Crawford, Maria Bertram marries for money. Later she is reunited with her first love and they have an affair which leads to her fall from grace.

Playing cupid: But that meant Emma, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, almost missed out on love her herself

Emma is so busy involving herself in other people's business she completely misses the fact that her one and only is her life-long friend Mr Knightley - until another woman expresses an interest in him. Austen writes of her Eureka moment: 'A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers, once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress; she touched, she admitted, she acknowledged the whole truth... Mr Knightley must marry no one but herself!'

Could your true love be staring you in the face?

In Sense and Sensibility Marianne's relatives are concerned when Mr Willoughby insists their relationship must be kept secret - and it turns out he is engaged to someone else.

Meanwhile, Elinor's intended beau Edward Ferrars has been secretly engaged to Lucy Steel for four years and regrets his proposal.

So if a new man refuses to introduce you to his friends and family, won't acknowledge being in a relationship with you on Facebook or otherwise and insists your dates remain secret, consider why.

If he loves you (and if he's really single), he shouldn't hide you.

Happily ever after: But women today don't need a man for financial security

In Pride and Prejudice, poor Charlotte Lucas becomes engaged to Mr Collins.

'There is no earthly reason why I shouldn't be as happy with him as any other', she tells Lizzy, to which she responds: 'But he's ridiculous!'

Charlotte tells her friend she 'can't afford to be romantic' because at 'I'm twenty-seven years old, I've no money and no prospects. I'm already a burden to my parents and I'm frightened. So don't you judge me, Lizzy.'

Thankfully women today don't have to be dependent on their parents and then a husband for money and a roof over their heads (and 27 is no longer considered an age which it's old to be unmarried).
