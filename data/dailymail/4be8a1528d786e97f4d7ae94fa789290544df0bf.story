It was only on Monday that the couple had their arms around each other at the premiere of the new season of The Bachelor in Los Angeles.

But on Thursday TMZ revealed that Andi Dorfman, 27, has already called off her engagement to fiance Josh Murray, 30, after less than one year.

The couple met when they co-starred on ABC's The Bachelorette in the spring of 2014.

'After several months of being engaged and working on our relationship, we have decided that it's best for both of us to go our separate ways,' the reality stars said in a mutual statement.

'We are very sad that it has come to this point, but this is what's best for both of us individually.'

Murray posted and then deleted an emotional Instagram on Thursday.
