A desperate man was told by a 999 call handler that it wasn’t possible to ‘magic an ambulance’ as he watched his fiancee dying in front of him.

Colin Gash, 53, pleaded with emergency services over three separate calls – all the while Violet Alliston was crying out as she coughed up blood.

Despite 57-year-old Miss Alliston’s condition deteriorating rapidly, Mr Gash was also told: ‘We don’t have ambulances waiting on street corners.' 

Anger: Colin Gash is suing the NHS after a 999 call handler told him the service couldn't 'magic an ambulance'. He was calling in a distressed state as his partner Violet Alliston (right) lay dying

And a call handler wrongly deemed the family home to be a threatening environment because they could hear Miss Alliston’s two distressed sons who have learning difficulties.

Three ambulances were redirected from attending the family home, and when a fourth finally turned up after 40 minutes, it was too late to save her.

Her family later found out that she had unknowingly been suffering from cervical cancer.

Mr Gash said: ‘The way we were treated was just diabolical. It was like we were just a number, not human beings.

‘Because of what happened we didn’t even get the chance to say goodbye to her.’

He has now launched a clinical negligence case against the North East Ambulance Service.

Mr Gash said he was left in disbelief as the tragedy unfolded in June when the operator said that an ambulance could not be sent because raised voices could be heard in the house. It was in fact the sound of Miss Alliston’s two sons, Shaun, 34, and Dean, 32, who were shouting due to their inability to summon any help.

Death: Ms Alliston was in her home in Bishop Auckland when she was struck with severe pain

At one stage an ambulance was only five minutes from the house in Bishop Auckland, Durham, but a call handler told Mr Gash that she ‘couldn’t magic [it] to come straight away’.

An investigation found that the first ambulance dispatched to the scene had been stood down, while another was rerouted to a higher priority case.

A third was redirected for refuelling, with a St John Ambulance eventually arriving at the family home.

An investigation by the trust found that the call handler wrongly deciphered the frustration at the scene as aggression and also failed to confirm Miss Alliston’s level of consciousness. 

Interim chief executive Roger French wrote in the report that the call handler 'responded inappropriately' and 'showed a lack of empathy' to the family.

He added: 'The patient was clearly critically ill and they displayed this fear by shouting and swearing. The patient's son was calmed when advised that an ambulance was travelling.

'The call handler made a decision to categorise the call as unsuitable for a rapid response paramedic, believing the scene to be potentially unsafe for a lone worker.

'This resulted in the rapid response paramedic being instructed to leave the scene shortly after arrival.'

The report added the 999 call handler also failed to confirm whether Ms Alliston was conscious, even after being given information which suggested she could have passed out.

'The call handler failed to confirm what the main concern was and chose to triage the abdominal pain regardless,' the report said.

Bolton-based Asons Solicitors are now representing Mr Gash in a claim against the NHS.

Mr French wrote: 'It was agreed that the call handler failed to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and had not carried out their duties to the standards required.

'As a result the call handler has been referred to be dealt with under the Trust's Capability Policy with the aim to improve the level of service provided.'

He added procedures had been 'reinforced' throughout the department and the investigation had been shared with the North of England Commissioning Support Unit.

County Durham coroner Andrew Tweddle has cancelled an inquest because Ms Alliston's death was due to natural causes.

In a statement, Yvonne Ormston, chief executive of North East Ambulance Service, said: ‘The Trust identified concerns with the quality of the 999 call and launched an internal investigation.

‘A number of errors were identified and for that the Trust would like to again apologise unreservedly to the family, as well as offering reassurances that lessons have been learnt.’

But Mr Gash, who had planned to marry his partner last month, said: ‘You would expect somebody doing that kind of job to be experienced and to their job properly.

Police logs confirm Ms Alliston has died 

‘Apparently one of the women has been retrained but that doesn’t help me.

‘And I worry that this could happen to somebody else too if it isn’t addressed.

‘It was awful to see me and my boys watching their mother, and my partner, dying in front of us.’

Bishop Auckland's Labour MP Helen Goodman revealed she has had several complaints about the same ambulance service.

She told MailOnline: 'We've had many complaints about the North East Ambulance Service in recent months and I'm very sorry to hear about what happened to Ms Alliston.

'It's clear to me that there is a serious problem in the management of the North East Ambulance Service from the number of complaints I've been getting.

'This case is particularly bad but long waits are a big problem. Another problem is the unhelpfulness of call handlers on the telephone.

'Obviously there is a resource problem. The call handlers wouldn't be challenging the public if they could get the ambulances out to people.'
