A House vote on whether the U.S. should strike Syria could be delayed by a week, according to a Republican memo.

While senior Republicans Eric Cantor and John Boehner support a strike, the House is likely to wait until the Senate votes on Wednesday before making its decision.

News of the possible delay comes as President Obama and his aides prepare for a series of TV appearances and meetings to garner support for military action.

Action: President Obama tells the G20 summit on Friday the world cannot turn a blind eye to the chemical weapons attack in Syria

At the close of the G20 summit in Russia on Friday he said: 'Over 1,400 people were gassed. Over 400 of them were children. This is not something we've fabricated. This is not something that we are using as an excuse for military action.

He added: 'I was elected to end wars, and not start them,' the Huffington Post reported.

The Obama administration's lobbying campaign will end on Tuesday, when the President will address the nation to make his case for the strike.

He has said the military advises that an attack against Assad's regime could be effective 
at any time, according to The Hill.

However, Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said on Friday that Mr Obama did not intend to act without lawmakers' support.

'The President of course has the authority to act but it's neither his desire nor his intention to use that authority absent Congress backing him,' he said, according to Fox News.

Many believe that although the 
President can act without Congress backing, he will not proceed with a 
strike unless he has that support.

President Obama has been criticized and ridiculed by the Middle East press as he struggles to find backing for a strike in Syria at home.

While some said the President's delay in action was damaging his credibility, others claimed the U.S. would use the strike to begin a war against Iran, or that Israel was pulling the strings, according to Politico.

A journalist for Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, based in London, said: 'It is not surprising that Assad continues to commit his crimes against Syria and the Syrians, for Assad’s strength stems from Obama’s weakness'.

Michael Young, of Lebanon's Daily Star, asked: 'Will the most overrated of American presidents be shamed into action, if only to salvage his collapsing reputation?'

The generally pro-Western Al-Hayat, also based in London: said Obama had done nothing for two and a half years, 'until last August with a slip of the tongue he made the "mistake" of warning Bashar Assad against crossing the "red line" of using chemical weapons against his people'.

A
first Senate vote over the 'limited and specified use' of U.S. forces 
is expected on Wednesday. The resolution limits action to no more than 
90 days and bars the use of ground troops. 

The final vote is expected by the end of the week.

In
a memo to Republican lawmakers from majority leader Mr Cantor on 
Friday, he warned: 'Members should expect a robust debate and vote on an
authorization of use of military force pertaining to Syria in the next 
two weeks.'

A joint statement from senior Republicans last week said they expected the Syria debate to begin 'the week of September 9'.

Senior aides to President Obama are due to make several TV appearances in the next couple of days as part of efforts to rally support for action in Syria, where President Assad is accused of killing more than 1,400 in a chemical weapons attack last month.

National Security Adviser Susan Rice is due to make a speech at the New America Foundation on Monday, chief of staff Denis McDonough is expected to make five appearances on major political talk shows on Sunday, and John Kerry and Vice-President Biden have been urging lawmakers to vote yes.

Vice-President Biden was also due to host a state dinner for Senate Republicans to encourage support.

Only 28 per cent of the American public support a strike, and 48 per cent are opposed, according to a Pew poll last week.

Despite this, the President has pressed the importance of making a forceful response to the atrocities carried out on August 21.

'We are the United States of America. We cannot turn a blind eye to images like the ones we've seen out of Syria,' he said in his weekly address today.

Only France has said it will support the U.S. plan for a strike against Syria, although it said it wanted to wait for the report from UN inspectors who collected evidence after the chemical weapons attack, Fox News reported.

The EU agreed the attack was the work of Assad's regime but has said a potential military response should come after the UN report.
