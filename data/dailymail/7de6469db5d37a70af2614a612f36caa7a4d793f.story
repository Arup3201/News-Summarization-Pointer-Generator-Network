A couple who fell in love over Skype have tied the knot - dressed as the cartoon characters The Flintstones.

David and Linda Alves shunned the conventional wedding dress and mourning suit combination in favour of Fred and Wilma costumes.

The modern Stone Age family were determined their big day would be as 
colourful as possible and were joined in fancy dress by pals wearing 
Batman and Robin outfits and even a native Indian chief.

Retired fireman David and Linda, 56, and, 52, finally swapped vows after a whirlwind romance conducted almost entirely online.

David Alves and Linda Eglen dressed as the Flintstones on their wedding day at the Registry Office King's Lynn Town Hall.

The divorcees met in their hometown of King's Lynn, Norfolk, five years 
ago and stayed in touch over the internet when David emigrated to Corfu.

But when Linda fell ill with a brain tumour two years ago, David
jetted back to Britain to help nurse her back to health.

He returned to the holiday island, but after realising how much he missed her, he popped the big question over Skype - even though 
they had only seen each other six times.

The pair finally got married on Friday with 20 friends and family at the registrar office in King's Lynn Town Hall.

The groom said: 'When I got down on one knee, she couldn't see me on the
screen. We wanted to go for something different from the white dress 
and tuxedo.

'It was just an idea that sprung to mind. We are not massive fans of the
Flintstones, it's just they are a famous cartoon couple. We tried to 
think of an iconic couple and it just kept coming back to Fred and 
Wilma.

'We are getting on in our years so we thought it was a great idea. It 
shows you don't have to spend a fortune. The registrar thought it was a 
great experience and she made a couple of jokes during the ceremony. She
thought it was funny and original.

'Married life is yabba-dabba-doo.'

The happy couple celebrate with a kiss after their unconventional wedding

The cartoon-mad couple met when David rented a flat above Linda's ex-partner's club and instantly struck up a friendship.

When Linda and her ex separated romance blossomed between the colourful couple, even though David had moved to Corfu in 2010.

House wife Linda suffered a brain tumour in 2010 which brought David to 
the UK for three months to care for her. She is in remission, but still 
undergoing regular six monthly check-ups.

Sadly Linda's dad, former sailor Sidney Pratt, 86, passed away on Friday - the morning of their wedding day.

David said: "It is obviously an incredible unhappy time for Linda's 
family. He was a great man but he wanted Linda to go ahead with her 
wedding day.

'No time would have been a good time, because he wasn't going to be there, so we went ahead.

'It was a happy celebration but Sid was missed, we just hope he was there with us.'

The couple will remain in the UK until September 27, when they return their home in Corfu.
