Alice Lee, the sister of the famous To Kill A Mockingbird author and an influential Alabama lawyer and church leader in her own right, has died.

Miss Alice, as she was known, died on Monday according to an online notice posted by Johnson Funeral Home in Monroeville, the south Alabama home of Alice and Harper Lee.

No cause of death was given, and the announcement said arrangements are as yet incomplete.

Lee was 103 and had practiced law until just a few years ago. For a time she was Alabama's oldest practicing attorney.

She was also active for years as a leader in the United Methodist Church in south Alabama, which has an award named in her honor. 

Though her younger sister famously stopped granting interviews in 1964, Alice Lee spoke to PBS about five years ago for a documentary about her famous sibling.

Miss Alice was already 15 years old when her sister Harper Nelle was born.

Throughout her life she helped guard the privacy of her sister, who in 1961 won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel about racial injustice in the South.

Harper drew back from the public eye in the 1960s because ‘as time went on, she said reporters began taking too many liberties with what she said,’ said Miss Alice in the documentary.

During her many years as a lawyer, Miss Alice's office was located on the upper floor of the Monroeville bank where the original manuscript of her sister’s famed novel was locked in the vaults.

In the PBS documentary, called Hey Boo, she said there was no one secret in particular to her longevity – only that she lived ‘day by day’ and ‘doesn’t do anything to bring on dying.’

At the time of the interview, Miss Alice was 98 and nearly deaf.

Even so, she told of her young life in Alabama, and how the Great Depression delayed her slightly when becoming a lawyer.

Her father encouraged her to join his firm after she passed the bar in 1943.

She asked how a woman would be received in a small law office, to which her father responded: ‘You never know until you try.’

Harper Lee, was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President George W Bush in  2007, but soon after suffered a stroke that has left her in a wheelchair and partially paralyzed

Harper Lee's lone published novel, released in 1960, tells the story of small-town lawyer Atticus Finch, his two children and the struggle against racial prejudice and injustice in the Jim Crow South. 

The book details the goings on in the fictitious sleepy town of Maycomb, Alabama between 1932 and 1935.

It is told through the eyes of Jean Louise ‘Scout’ Finch, who is a knowledgeable six-year-old tomboy who has the mind of a child but the understanding of an adult.

Among other things, the story details the trial of a black man accused of rape by a white woman.

Scout’s father, Atticus Finch, represented Tom Robinson, a 25-year-old farm worker.

Though Tom was obviously innocent, he was convicted by the all-white jury and was shot dead while trying to escape from prison.

The 1962 movie adaptation of To Kill A Mockingbird starred Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch and Brock Peters as Tom Robinson. It won three Academy Awards

The novel is considered an American classic and is often taught in schools, teaching students important lessons about race, prejudice, misrepresentation, and the loss of childhood.

Ironically, winning the Pulitzer caused the friendship between Harper and famous writer Truman Capote to deteriorate.

Capote, it was said, was the model for Charles Baker ‘Dill’ Harris, the best friend of Scout and Jem. Dill spent much of the novel trying to get reclusive Boo Radley out of his house.

He was jealous that Harper's work received the ultimate prize, and his did not. 

The book was also turned into a 1962 movie of the same name, which starred Gregory Peck and Robert Duvall, and which won three Academy Awards.

Harper Lee, now 88, suffered a stroke in 2007 which has left her in a wheelchair and partially paralyzed.

She lives in Monroeville after years of splitting her time between the town of 28,000 and New York.
