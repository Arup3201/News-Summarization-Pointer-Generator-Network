A teenage gang of two girls and three boys have been accused of raping and beating a 16-year-old girl so badly she broke bones in her face and bled from her ear.

The victim was allegedly set upon when she visited a friend's house in Hollywood on Friday night.

Police claim she was raped by one of the accused, 19-year-old Jayvon Woolfork, while she was held down by Lanel Singleton, 18, and three minors - a 17-year-old male, 15-year-old female and a 14-year-old girl.

The victim claimed she was kicked, thrown down stairs and had her face smashed on concrete, breaking bones near both her eyes.

Hollywood Police told NBC 6 they were able to identify all five of the teenagers allegedly involved because one of the accused took video of the fight and sexual assault on their cell phone.

Woolfork and Singleton were jailed without bond when they appeared in court yesterday, dressed in jailhouse scrubs with their wrists handcuffed behind their backs, for the first hearing in their case.

According to the Sun Sentinel, Broward County Judge John Hurley said: 'This 16-year-old woman, both of her eyes were closed from being beaten, she had blood coming from one of her ears.

'The court is concerned for the safety of this 16-year-old alleged victim.'Â

All the teenagers have been charged with 
sexual assault and kidnapping and the three minors may be tried as 
adults, the court heard.

The girl was listening to music and watching TV at her friend's house in McKinley Street, Hollywood, when she was approached by the group who demanded she have sex with Woolfork or be beaten, according to the arrest reports.

When she refused, she was beaten and dragged to a bedroom, where all of the accused removed her clothes and held her down while Woolfork raped her, the report said.

The 14-year-old defendant's father told NBC 6 that his daughter admitted to beating up the teenager, but said she claimed she was acting in self-defence while protecting one of the co-accused.

He said he believed the alleged rape must have happened after the fight and said his daughter told him she was not involved in the sexual assault because she had left the house after the initial attack.

He said of his daughter: 'She handled it the wrong way.

'If you're to get in the middle of it, defend your friend any way that you can. But don't beat someone to the point where they wind up in the hospital.'

He added: 'There was no sexual assault. There was no kidnapping. There was no such thing as the charges that are now pending against her.'
