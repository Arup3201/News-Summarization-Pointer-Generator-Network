A soldier who faced losing most of his pension after he was made redundant has been granted a transfer within the Army that means he will now receive his full entitlement.

Sergeant Michael Anderson, 35, of the Royal Dragoon Guards, was 72 hours away from qualifying for a substantial Army pension when he was told he was to lose the job he had held for nearly 18 years.

As a result, he and his wife Jolene, 32, who live in service housing in Catterick, North Yorkshire, feared he would miss out on a sum totalling almost £175,000.

Sergeant Michael Anderson, 35, pictured with his
 wife Jolene, 32, had faced losing his job with the Army three days before he 
would qualify for his full pension - but he has now been given the opportunity for a transfer

The case had fuelled suspicions that 
the Army, which is shedding 20,000 personnel in a cost-cutting exercise,
 was targeting those within touching distance of generous lifetime 
payments.

And it sparked criticisms that the Government was breaking the Armed Forces Covenant, the nation's duty of care to troops.

But today, after significant media 
coverage and a petition signed nearly 100,000 supporters, the Ministry 
of Defence said Sgt Anderson had been given the chance to take on a new 
role in the Army.

An MoD spokesman said: 'There have 
been a number of inaccuracies reported surrounding an individual soldier
 in an online petition.

'We can be clear that the individual 
in question has successfully applied for a transfer to another branch 
within the Army, and subject to successful completion of training will 
not be made redundant.

'The individual is fully aware of this
 and has been kept informed throughout the process. We will continue to 
work with him to secure his transfer within the Army.'

In a statement, Sgt Anderson added: 
'There has been a considerable amount of misunderstanding surrounding an
 online petition with the aim of securing my pension. 

'I was selected for redundancy but 
have applied for transfer to another service within the Army. I have 
been successful in the application process and am looking forward to 
beginning training for my new role.'

Poppy: Mrs Anderson has written an open letter to the Prime Minister asking for better treatment for her soldier husband

It comes after Mrs Anderson started an
 online petition on change.org asking the Prime Minister to give her 
husband his job back that by tonight had been signed by nearly 100,000 
people.

Mrs Anderson, whose husband has served
 in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Iraq, wrote on the site: 'When Michael 
was informed of his redundancy I felt like my heart had been ripped out,
 more for Michael than me.

'Everything he knew and had worked for
 from the age of 16 taken away. We had planned on using the pension to 
secure a mortgage when we left army accommodation and to support our 
young family while Michael established a new career on civvy street.

'After a life of service for our country our family's financial security has now been cruelly snatched away from us.'

She said calling it a 'pension' was 
incorrect, arguing that the military pension was 'the key financial 
promise on which personnel are recruited, retained and promoted'.

Sgt Anderson, a father of two, whose 
case was first reported by the Mail in July, has been a soldier since he
 was 18 years old. The non-commissioned officer has also served as a 
casualty visitor, providing support for the families of killed or 
injured troops.

He was told in June that he had been 
selected for compulsory redundancy from his job as a welfare officer 
with a 12-month notice period, ending on June 18 2014.

Had he been allowed to work until June
 21, he would have qualified for an immediate pension and tax-free lump 
sum worth an estimated £261,278 over his lifetime

Instead he faced a redundancy payout of £87,417, with a £4,374-a-year pension once he reached 60.

In the preamble to the petition 
started by Mrs Anderson, a mental health care manager, she wrote how she
 and her husband had felt 'honoured to be part of the Army family' and 
said they wanted to continue to be part of it.

And now they have the chance after her
 husband was offered a transfer to another branch of the Army - an 
opportunity that means he will be able to collect his full pension.

If Sgt Anderson successful completes the training for the new job, he will now longer face redundancy.

And even if he fails the training 
programme he will be eligible for his immediate pension due to the time 
spent on his ongoing transfer process.

The MoD's spokesman added: 'All those made redundant will receive an Armed Forces pension and a generous compensation package.

'Inevitably we have to draw the line somewhere, but those who are close to their immediate pension point ...will receive a larger tax-free lump sum in compensation.'

Army pensions are one of the key selling points to would-be recruits, and guarantees retired soldiers a full monthly pension based on their final salary.

One of its chief attractions is the fact that contributors to the scheme do not have their salary deducted each month, as in many other pension schemes.

After two years of regular service, soldiers are entitled to receive the pension when they are 65.

Soldiers who serve for 12 years will receive a tax-free resettlement grant to ease them into their civilian life.

And anyone who is over 40 and has served at least 18 years can claim an immediate pension and tax-free lump sum when they leave the Army, with a second lump sum when they turn 65.

From April 2015 changes to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme will come in, meaning soldiers will have to work for 20 years rather than 18 before they can qualify for a full pension.

The new scheme will also see retired soldiers able to claim at a reduced rate, rather than the full rate, from the age of 55 until they reach the planned state pension age of 67.

Case sparked accusations that the Army was seeking to save cash by targeting soldiers close to generous lifetime payments for redundancy

But now the MoD says Sgt Anderson has applied for transfer to another job within the Army and will be entitled to his full retirement package
