Real Madrid continued their 100 per cent start to this season's Champions League  with a one-sided victory at Liverpool on Wednesday night.

Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and a Karim Benzema double gave the current tournament holders a 3-0 lead at half-time which they didn't look back from.

For Liverpool, the result was a nightmare which saw £16million summer signing Mario Balotelli substituted at half-time after a dire performance.

Here, Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell gives  his verdict on how the players performed.

Liverpool (4-3-3)

Simon Mignolet - 5.5

Failed to convince when coming for crosses and found himself embarrassed by Pepe’s prod for Benzema’s second. Atoned somewhat with super save when one-on-one with Ronaldo.

Glen Johnson - 4.5

Allowed Ronaldo the freedom of Liverpool’s half at one point in the opening period by advancing too far forward and failed to get close to Benzema for his header.

Martin Skrtel - 5

Errantly tried to shepherd the ball back to Mignolet when it bounced off Pepe for the third goal and crashed into the hoardings when Benzema smartly side-stepped his sliding tackle by the touchline.

Dejan Lovren - 5.5

Being caught out by a sublime pass from James is no disgrace but appeared an uncertain presence

Alberto Moreno - 5.5

Attacking thrusts were limited and defensively James had the beating of him. Over-stretched to cut out Benzema’s pass that set up Ronaldo in the second half.

Jordan Henderson - 5.5 

Tried to get physical with Ronaldo straight out the traps with a bodycheck. But failed to translate his energy into effective action.

Steven Gerrard - 5

Swamped by Real’s carousel of midfield passers. Toni Kroos and Luka Modric just a class apart. Tried to unleash Liverpool’s attackers with one swift pass forward but failed each time.

Joe Allen - 6

Produced a fine shot from 18 yards that whistled narrowly past the post, probably via a deflection from the fingertips of Casillas. A very good show given this was his first start since September 9.

Raheem Sterling - 6.5

Willing runner all evening and Liverpool’s brightest player. No tired limbs here. Tested Casillas with a dipping shot in the second half.

Mario Balotelli - 4.5

Offered little as an attacking presence and sulked when things did not go his way. Time looks nigh for him to start on the bench.

Philippe Coutinho - 6

Went closest for Liverpool with a crisp shot from outside the box that smacked the post. But failed to dazzle like he can.

Substitutes

Adam Lallana - 6.5 (for Balotelli 45’)

Lallana was silvery when he came on and did more than Balotelli in his first 10 minutes. 

Lazar Markovic - 6 (for Coutinho 67’), Emre Can - 6 (for Henderson 67’) 

Manager 

Brendan Rodgers - 6

Held faith with Balotelli but went unrewarded. Must consider altering tactics now. Credit for picking Allen, at least.

Real Madrid (4-4-2)

Iker Casillas - 6.5

Beat away Gerrard’s long-range shot in the first half but then looked shaky from the Liverpool captain’s corner, juggling the ball. Appeared to make a finger-tip save from Allen’s effort but was not recognised by officials.

Alvaro Arbeloa - 6.5 

Got in an early shove on Sterling to mark his presence and was consistent. Brought ball out of defence confidently.

Raphael Varane - 7 

Young centre-back snuffed out danger like a defender 10 years his senior. Never looked ruffled.

Pepe - 7

Real determination from Real’s nuisance-in-chief to reach the ball for Benzema’s second ahead of Liverpool’s players and was untroubled in the main by the hosts' attack, neatly dispossessing Sterling at one point.

Marcelo - 7.5

Offered a proper attacking outlet with bursts forward to pin back Johnson. Defended soundly too, which sometimes isn’t the case.

James Rodriguez - 8

Simply beautiful pass to set up Ronaldo and displayed the touches that made him one of the star’s of the World Cup for Colombia. Even after a nasty cut to his face.

Toni Kroos - 8.5

Appeared effortless as he conducted the Real midfield with pass after pass. Dictated the flow of the game from the first minute.

Luka Modric - 7.5

Helped strangle the life out of Liverpool by keeping attacks flowing and tempo high. A diamond player.

Isco - 7.5

Starting because of injury to Gareth Bale, he showed he is more than just a stand-in. Neat dribbles down the left and retained the ball consummately.

Karim Benzema - 9 - STAR MAN

Took his first with a brilliant header and showed striker’s instincts by side-footing second inside six-yard box. Broke at pace time and again.

Cristiano Ronaldo - 8.5

Celebrated his goal like a man who knew he would score. Caressed the ball into the back of the net and was a constant menace with darting runs.

Substitutes

Sami Khedira - N/A (for Ronaldo 75’), Asier Illarramendi- N/A (for Kroos 82’) 

All came on when the match was won and barely broke a sweat.

Manager

Carlo Ancelotti - 8

Sent his gilded crop out with ferocity and little sympathy. Will be pleased he saw out a 3-0 half-time lead against Liverpool.

Referee

Nicola Rizzoli - 7 

Had no major decisions to make and correctly booked Kroos for a crude bodycheck on Sterling.
