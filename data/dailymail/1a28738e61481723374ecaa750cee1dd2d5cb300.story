Bad babysitter: Larry Leroy Floyd was arrested on Saturday after allegedly trying to circumcise his 20-month-old nephew with a kitchen knife

A Florida man was arrested after he allegedly tried to circumcise his 20-month-old nephew with a kitchen knife.

Larry Leroy Floyd, 24, was babysitting at his sister's house when, for reasons that are unclear, he decided to take a blade and try to slice off his nephew's foreskin, according to police.

The boy's father called 911 after he returned from a shopping trip to find his son bloodied and crying, but by the time officers arrived he had already taken the child to hospital.

Ocala police arrested Floyd after interviews at the scene suggested he had tried to circumcise the boy with a kitchen knife, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Sergeant Michael Sommer told the New York Daily News that another of the child's uncles was also at the home, in the troubled Spring Manor apartment complex in Ocala, but was in another room and didn't realise what was happening. 

'He heard the baby crying as the father arrived (back home),' the policeman said. 'He rushed out and said your son is bleeding.'

He added: 'By the time we got the call the father scooped up the child and left for the hospital.' Floyd also left the scene after telling the father he had circumcised the boy, Ocala.com reports.

There have been no updates on the boy's condition but Sgt Sommer said that he expects him to recover.

Most often an elective surgery on newborns for cultural and religious reasons, circumcision is generally performed by surgeons using scalpels and with the help of local or general anaesthetic.

About one-third of males worldwide are circumcised, with the procedure especially popular in Israel and the Muslim world (where it is near universal), the U.S. and parts of South East Asia and Africa.

The World Health Organisation recommends circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV program in areas where the virus is epidemic, as evidence suggests it helps to reduce the risk of infection.

Circumcision is also associated with reduced rates of cancer-causing forms of HPV and risk of both UTIs and penile cancer. Done correctly, it does not appear to have an effect on sexual function.
