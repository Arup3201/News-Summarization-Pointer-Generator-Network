A teenage girl has died after she jumped out of her parents' moving car during an argument.

Miss Field's stepfather was driving the van with her mother also inside when the teenager became upset and jumped out from the van's rear passenger side, according to police.

It appears Field was injured when she struck the pavement of a county road just north of Seymour.

Mike Carothers, from the Jackson County Sheriff's Department, told WLKY: 'We're trying to make sure and try and find out what was going on at the time when she got out of the vehicle, whether there was an argument. 

Investigation: Claims have been made that prior to her death, the 16-year-old had been a victim of bullying at her high school in Indiana

'We hear a lot of things.  We just need to get to the bottom and find out exactly what did occur.'

The teenage girl suffered severe head injuries and was flown by helicopter about 60 miles north to the Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis where she died surrounded by her family.

One blog claimed that Miss Field had been the victim of school bullying. She was a sophomore at Jennings County High School.

According to a post on the Columbuzz 
blog: 'There was an unbearable amount of cyber bullying, and remarks 
about her on a daily basis.'

Miss Field is survived by her mother Kandle Caplinger (Jason) Bowerly and father Kevin Field along with brother Noah and sister Sydney.

According
to her obituary, the teenager loved music, singing and photography and 
belonged to a girls' choir called the Dominics.

Her funeral will take place this Friday at St John’s Lutheran Church in Sauers.
