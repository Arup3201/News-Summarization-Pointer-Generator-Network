Fifteen years ago, when he was plucked from obscurity to play the role of ballet-dancing Billy Elliot in the hit film, Jamie Bell felt like the luckiest boy in the world.

He was so grateful to the man who discovered him - the film's flamboyant director Stephen Daldry - that he promptly left his down-to-earth family in Teesside and moved in with Daldry and his then partner, stage designer Ian MacNeil.

It was an intense relationship, with Daldry assuming the role of surrogate dad to a teenager whose biological father had never played any role in his life.

'Mutual decision' to break up: Evan Rachel Wood and Jamie Bell before their split

After appearing in the film, which told the story of an 11-year-old boy who becomes a successful ballet dancer in the face of huge prejudice, Jamie was catapulted to instant fame and fortune.

He moved from a post-war semi to a 15th century manor in the Home Counties, and from a working-class area to a metrosexual acting crowd that moved between London, New York and Los Angeles.

Just how quickly he left his family behind  was obvious when he won a Bafta for his performance as Billy, and kissed Daldry in celebration rather than his mother, Eileen.

This was to be just the start of a bohemian, transatlantic life, which saw Jamie Bell attempt, albeit with limited success, to crack Hollywood.

Encouraged by his mentor Daldry, he embraced the progressive values of his new showbusiness world.

The actor still describes himself as a 'lucky husband' on Twitter

His Twitter feed is liberally sprinkled with gay rights postings, while he was proud to set up home with the openly bisexual actress, Evan Rachel Wood, 26, who two years ago became his wife and last summer bore him a son.

All in all, Jamie, 28, seemed to lead an enviably charmed life. Yet last month the couple gave a statement announcing the end of their marriage, speaking vaguely of their 'mutual decision' to part, their 'love and respect' and a commitment to 'co-parenting' their son.

Whatever the couple's claims, in truth the split was far from amicable. More telling were Jamie's posts on Twitter, where he still poignantly describes himself as 'a lucky husband, a devoted father, an actor, tap dancer, Arsenal supporter and major procrastinator'.

Just three weeks ago he posted 'ILY [I LOVE YOU] @Evanrachel wood. Just in case I don't tell you enough', before adding forlornly three days later: 'And then there was nothing.'

Days later, he posted one more comment (which has subsequently been deleted): 'Don't punish people for things they can't control.'

Cryptic though it sounds, the meaning was immediately clear to his friends and family. For many believe it is his wife's enduring attraction to women that lies at the heart of their split.

The night before she announced the breakdown of her marriage, the blonde actress appeared at a gala in Los Angeles titled 'An Evening With Women' - a fundraiser for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.

There she posed for a photograph with Milla Jovovich, an actress she has openly confessed to having a crush on, and Michelle Rodriguez, another bisexual actress who has reportedly set her  cap at Evan after allegedly splitting from British supermodel Cara Delevingne.

Days later Evan was posing for a photograph with another prominent lesbian couple, the model Ruby Rose and fashion designer Phoebe Dahl (granddaughter of the author Roald).

Like Jamie's cryptic comment, this image was also swiftly deleted from social networking sites after the split was announced.

But while Evan may be enjoying a whirl of parties, Jamie - whose acting career is still to fulfill its early promise - is said to be reeling from the split.

'It's a miracle he hasn’t had a complete nervous breakdown, but he's a canny lad and a strong person,' a childhood friend said this week.

'All the good things in his life happened because of Billy Elliot, but so did all the rubbish that drags him down. He was confused for a long time, then he found Evan and sorted it all out. Now he's back where he started.

Overnight success: Jamie found fame as a boy playing Billy Elliot

'I love him to bits, but I wouldn't swap places with him for all the tea in China.'

Nor does Jamie have a close and supportive family to turn to. His father John, 58, a toolmaker, played no part in his life, leaving to start a new life and family on the South Coast.

Jamie's mother, Eileen, was left to raise him and his older sister, Kathryn, 33, as a single mother on her receptionist’s wage.

It was into this situation that Stephen Daldry landed, quickly becoming the father figure Jamie had so sorely missed.

The director taught Jamie to shoot and drive, presenting him with a shotgun and one of the U.S. Army jeeps used in the film Saving Private Ryan.

Schooling was gradually set aside as his career took off, with a series of well-received yet unremarkable movies, such as Nicholas Nickleby. His early girlfriends, who included a shop assistant and a nurse, could not compete with the glitz of his film-star life.

Jamie rapidly developed a reputation for being spiky and awkward. He gave interviews in a T-shirt emblazoned with the words: 'F*** you.'

By the age of 18 he was fully immersed in the louche world of showbusiness and about to film his first major adult role, in Peter Jackson’s blockbuster adaptation of King Kong, when he met Evan, from North Carolina.

'She fitted the bill perfectly,' says his friend. 'She was totally different from the girls at home. Really alternative, cool and with that incredible confidence American girls have. Jamie was just dazzled by her.'

Yet for all his adopted quirkiness, Jamie remained fundamentally conservative compared to Evan, who soon ended their relationship, before taking up with another man, rock star Marilyn Manson, almost 25 years her senior.

It was to mark a low point for Jamie, who was also stung by the relative failure of King Kong.

He moved into a flat with a 'special friend' - a man he never identified, but had known since before Billy Elliot - and they were inseparable for a while, though there is no suggestion of a romantic involvement.

His rare visits back home to Co. Durham were increasingly awkward. On one occasion a stranger spat on him, whereupon Jamie's companion chased him down the road to dish out summary justice.

He became increasingly withdrawn and between the ages of 22 and 25 effectively took a career break as the major roles he craved failed to materialise.

Salvation came in the form of Steven Spielberg, who cast him as the lead in his adaptation of the comic book Tintin.

Evan when she was pregnant: The couple will now share custody of their son

But though the film turned a healthy profit, it barely registered in the American heartland regarded by Hollywood as the true mark of stardom.

By then he had bought an apartment in New York. His broad Northern accent was replaced with a mid-Atlantic twang.

Through it all, however, he craved stability - something he appeared to achieve when he reconciled with Evan in 2011.

He moved from New York to Los  Angeles to be near to her, eschewing the starry Hollywood Hills for the more edgy beachside neighbourhoods to the west of the city. The couple were regularly seen out on their bicycles, shopping in organic supermarkets and eating in fashionable coffee shops and restaurants.

Jamie also joined his girlfriend as a vocal campaigner for gay rights, seemingly comfortable with her bisexuality.

Recent events have cast that in a different light.

And Jamie's devastation at the end of their marriage is exacerbated by the prospect of being separated from his son. He has spoken touchingly about how the ten-month-old - whose name has been kept secret by Jamie and Evan - has enriched his life.

'It's amazing. When you become a parent everything changes,' he said recently. 'For such a long time, I thought of myself as a teenager gallivanting around the world taking jobs where I felt like it, but life is totally different now.'

He changes nappies, feeds and nurtures his son in a way his own father never did. Friends say that he is determined to play an active role in the boy's life, and that the couple plan to share custody.

Somewhat ironically, just as his personal life has taken such a turn for the worse, his faltering career seems to be on the upswing.

Jamie is filming a hotly anticipated remake of the Fantastic Four superhero franchise, which may yet launch him onto the Hollywood A-list.

As Stephen Daldry said in the aftermath of his big breakthrough: 'Jamie is just amazing. I hope we don't screw him up, turn him into Drew Barrymore or something.'

Given the latest turn of events in poor Jamie's life, it’s as well that his talent is matched by a remarkable emotional resilience.
