Leading author and expert Professor Brendan Gleeson has developed predictions of what Australian cities will look like in the future, and his findings will come as a shock to many. 

It gives an insight into what Australia will look like 30 years' time. The cities will be much more like Hong Kong and Dubai in terms of cityscape with increased futuristic architectural design.

Food and shade producing trees will adorn all streets giving a much stronger green canopy less hard surface feel to the cities, while cars will be few in number, small, driverless and lightweight.

Sydney in 2043 is predicted to see the Harbour Bridge covered in solar absorbing material

There’ll be no personal flying cars however, but lots of drone like machines of many shapes and sizes including some carrying small numbers of human occupants.

‘I anticipate the effects of climate change could have a huge impact,’ Professor Gleeson of Melbourne University says.

‘As key global resources run out, we will have to adapt how we live and our cities will change to reflect that. Mass migration will also drive big changes as parts of the planet become much less inhabitable.'

In Melbourne the vision is that it will have a great towerscape/city skyline

In Sydney the Harbour Bridge will be white-grey, covered in solar absorbing material and will also have large open scoops over its main arches that collect massive amounts of rainwater.

There will be greenery on skylines that will have energy efficient vertical gardens, and increased use of ‘aquaculture’. More ‘towerscapes’ will be on the skyline (Parramatta, Penrith, Liverpool).

Melbourne is predicted to have a great towerscape/city skyline, with the MCG covered for heat protection and water catchment. Aquaculture and solar arrays will be across Port Phillip Bay.

In Brisbane road tunnels will appear to become safe havens through extreme weather conditions – due to global warming, and energy use transport will flock Brisbane’s river crisscrossed with dozens of foot/cycle bridges.

Inner city parks will be transformed for agriculture and water catchment in Adelaide

Adelaide will have a new ultra-Mediterranean climate. Inner city parks will be transformed for agriculture and water catchment. 

Depopulation due to climate change and a collapse in water catchment is predicted in Perth. It’ll be a poorer, less well maintained city overall. 

‘Australia’s cities will have grown in size and complexity but the major change will flow from a hotter, wilder climate and great stresses on basic resources, especially water and energy,' Professor Gleeson says.

‘On the positive side, great transitions to clean energy will have been made, and all parts of the urban fabric put to work harvesting energy and water. The urban tree canopy will have grown to give a much more forested feel to the cities.’

The findings have been used in Syfy’s 12 Monkeys TV series, which is inspired by the hit 1995 film set in 2043. It starts on Thursday night.
