This is the moment a playful young seal tries its best to hitch a ride with a couple of kayaks - but keeps sliding off.

The grey seal pup was filmed as it made several attempts to climb aboard the canoes in Poole Bay, Dorset. 

At first the adorable seal tries his best to jump on both the kayaks, but he keeps sliding off, back into the water. 

Hitching a ride: Ron the friendly seal attempts to climb onto a kayak in Poole Bay, Dorset

Attempt one: The young pup makes it onto one of the kayaks, and momentarily keeps his balance

He then manages to get onto the left kayak, but just as it looks like he has found himself a comfortable spot - he falls in again.

The pup, known locally as Ron the Seal,  finally succeeds by draping himself across both of the kayaks.

Kayaker Andrew Linstead shot the video of the young seal's repeated attempts to climb aboard his raft as he paddled in Poole Bay.

This is the third time Mr Linstead has had an encounter with Ron the Seal in four months.  

Last November, while Mr Linstead was practicing rolling his kayak in the water, he noticed the seal watching him and then joining in, rolling every time he did. 

Fail: Unfortunately for Ron the Seal, he cannot manage to stay on the kayak, and falls back in the water

On it again: Ron the seal proves he is not a quitter and is soon at it again, trying to climb the kayaks

A month later, the pair met again, as Ron jumped on the back of his kayak and hitched a ride around for several hours.

The latest encounter, filmed by Mr Linstead, lasted for four hours with Ron climbing on and off Mr Linstead's kayak and even bringing him a fish it had caught.

Mr Linstead, from London, said: 'I've had quite a few encounters with Ron now, we are becoming good friends!

'The first time I saw him was when I was practising rolling my kayak. Ron seemed to roll whenever I rolled my kayak.

'Afterwards I put a message on a Facebook local community page asking if anyone knew anything about the seal and I got lots of responses. The locals have called it Ron, as in Ronseal.

'I think when Ron now sees me he feels comfortable.

'This time I was out on my own and I saw another kayaker. I asked him if he could brace or roll his kayak in case Ron got on his boat and tipped up over.

New buddies: Their encounter lasted for four hours with Ron climbing on and off Mr Linstead's kayak and even bringing him a fish it had caught

Another ride: This is the third time Ron and Mr Linstead, from London, has met in four months

'He said he couldn't so he came alongside me and held on to my kayak.

'I don't think he believed me that Ron would come over but he did.

'Ron tried to climb on but he kept slipping off. It went on for hours, I took my last shot of him about four hours later.

'I've spoken to other kayakers in the area and they say they have never seen anything like that.'

Julie Hatcher, from Dorset Wildlife Trust, said: 'This is a young grey seal. Seals tend to be a bit wary of people, we don't know why this one isn't. It might just be a personality thing.

'They are solitary animals when they are at sea. They come together for breeding but generally are solitary in the water.

'Young ones tend to be more friendly and playful. I have dived with seals and the young ones will come near you, they can be quite curious and like playing hide and seek, but the adults don't tend to.'

The waters of the UK are home to more than 180,000 grey seals, which is more than a third of the world's population.
