A Queensland snake catcher has had a frantic week after a spate of calls from households besieged by baby snakes.

Local snake catchers were called by three properties in Cairns this week-in Redlynch, Holloways Beach and Caravonica-which were facing an outbreak of hatchling snakes.

The snake eggs hatched in the roofs of the houses before they fell down the walls and into the house, releasing groups of up to ten of the tiny serpents.

Cairns snake catcher Matt Hagan has had a frantic week removing the hatchlings 

Cairns snake catcher Matt Hagan told Daily Mail Australia ‘we received the calls in very quick succession. It was pretty unusual to have an outbreak in three different homes.’

February is the middle of the wet season in Queensland, along with the peak hatching period for an array of reptiles in the area.

‘The eggs are generally incubated about three months after being laid, which is the time floods and the wet season are peaking.’

Hagan said while residents often panic that the hatchlings will mean larger snakes are in the property, the snakes abandon their young at birth and will rarely be found near the hatchlings.

Despite having weak venom, brown tree snakes can appear highly threatening, rearing it’s body into an S-shaped loop and striking viciously at its prey

‘One of the residents that called me thought the snakes were taipans, which are the most venomous land snakes. Thankfully they turned out to be brown tree snakes, which are only about as harmful as a wasp.’
