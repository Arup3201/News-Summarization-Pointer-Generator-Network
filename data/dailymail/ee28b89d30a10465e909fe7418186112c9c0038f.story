Engineers were working on a friend-or-foe recognition system for Turkish warplanes at the time of their suicides - a report by neuro-psychology expert Nevzat Tarhan asked that the possibility of telekinesis as a possible cause of the suicides be taken into consideration

Four engineers working at one of Turkey’s leading military electronics companies, who allegedly committed suicide, could all have been killed through telekinesis – the ability to manipulate or move objects with the mind, it is claimed.

Hüseyin Başbilen, who was one of the four working at the Aselsan corporation, which has won several defense and technology awards, was found dead in his car in August 2006.

Halim Ünal was shot in the head with one bullet in January 2007 while Evrim Yançeken fell from the balcony of his sixth-floor apartment nine days later.

Two years later a fourth engineer at the corporation, Burhanettin Volkan, allegedly also killed himself.

Başbilen, Ünal and Yançeken were working on a friend-or-foe recognition system for Turkish warplanes at the time of their suicides, brought back to public debate during the so-called Ergenekon coup trials, which saw dozens jailed for life following a plot to overthrow the government.

Now a report by the Turkish Prime Ministry Inspection Board has decided the four dead could have been directed toward the suicides by way of telekinesis.

The report, presented to the Ankara Public Prosecutor, cites work done by neuro-psychology expert Nevzat Tarhan.

Tarhan’s study asked the prosecution not to disregard the possibility of telekinesis as a possible cause of the suicides, which could have caused severe distress and headaches in the victims, giving them a tendency to kill themselves.

The waves, causing the headaches in the victims, could have been sent from 1.5 kilometers away, and could have directed the victims towards a suicidal state of mind, Mr Tarhan told daily Hürriyet.

He said an overcharge of electro magnetics could have also had the same effect on the engineers, which would then indicate neglect.

Telekinesis recently made the news after journalist Yiğit Bulut claimed certain powers were trying to kill Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdoğan through telekinesis.

Just weeks after his theories, Mr Bulut was named a chief consultant for Erdoğan.
