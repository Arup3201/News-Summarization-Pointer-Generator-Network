In less than two weeks, Fifty Shades of Grey fans will be queueing up for their popcorn and pic n’ mix, as they get ready to watch the steamiest Hollywood film in a decade.

The hotly-anticipated blockbuster is reported to have no less than 12 sex scenes between actors Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, with whips and blindfolds to boot.

But what was it really like to film those scenes? Could either of them actually have got turned on? What do you think about when pretending to enjoy being naked with a man or woman other than your partner? And is there some sort of etiquette to follow?

Actress Claire Kahane, 28, from London, (pictured) has had several sex scenes in her movie career, including opposite in the James Bond film Skyfall. She tells FEMAIL about bedroom etiquette and how awkward it is to fake sex

To answer these (and many more) questions about making love on film, FEMAIL spoke to the actress Claire Kahane, who has taken part in several sex scenes in her movie career.

Claire, 28, from London has faked making love on camera in her starring role in the 2014 film The Maid, had a steamy bedroom scene with a Dolce & Gabbana model in 2013’s Head Spinner and was the body double in sex scenes for the James Bond film Skyfall.

Claire talks us through the ins and outs - so to speak – of doing it on camera. 

She reveals all about faking an orgasm face, pulling pranks on your bedroom co-stars and what it’s like to have several people watching you in the throes of passion.

Is there an etiquette guide when taking part in a sex scene?

Make sure you brush your teeth, be washed and have deodorant on.

Also, I wouldn’t have anything like cheese and onion crisps beforehand and I’d check if the guy was allergic to seafood, because in that case I wouldn’t have something like a prawn salad.

As a rule, you don’t use tongues when kissing, but if the director wants it and no one objects, then you will use tongues.

Is it embarrassing?

I used to be a showgirl, which I guess is why I don’t mind being nude. 

Generally, it’s a closed set, so the people in the room are really only the ones that have to be there, but there are still about six of men and women present.

There’s the director, the first Assistant Director, the producer, the director of photography, possibly a make-up artist and then the sound guy with a massive boom hanging over your head.

So it’s a little less embarrassing than the whole crew in there watching.

How do you make it less awkward?

You discuss everything before you do it, so nothing comes as a surprise. 

It’s very choreographed and a lot of the time you rehearse it a bit beforehand, so you know what you’re doing. 

When I did Head Spinner, I had only known the actor for a few hours before we had to do the love scene. 

We actually took ourselves offset and we talked about everything that we were going to do, what we’d wear, what we wouldn’t wear, how we’d kiss, so it doesn’t come as a surprise.

How do you make sure that X-rated parts don’t get caught on camera?

Normally the girls wears pasties (nipple plasters) and sometimes a flesh-coloured G-string, or tape over your lower area. 

Some men wear a cup, stuck to you with body tape so there are no bits around the back or the side.

Claire reveals that she and Adam had a lengthy conversation about what they would do in their sex scene before it took place 

How do you make sure that you don’t get carried away?

It’s not as sensual or intimate as it comes across on screen at all, I mean there’s a crew in the room.

There’s a big furry boom right over your heads to capture every noise and cameras really close up around the sides of the bed or wherever you are.

It’s all very different to how it comes across onscreen.

It comes down to having to feel in the moment and feel the way your character does, of course, in reality you’re hot and sweaty and uncomfortable but you have to show that you are in the throes of passion.

How do you make it look like you are enjoying it?

When I did Head Spinner, we had to show everyone who was watching that we were completely comfortable with each other and completely in love because our characters had been together for a really long time as boyfriend and girlfriend. 

If the director wants you to feel excited or whatever, you have to show that onscreen, so it just comes down to behaving the way your character would.

The director tells you what he wants every step of the way, for instance, “Walk through here, sit on this part of the bed, he lies down first, you take his clothes off, touch her face” and so on.

You don’t want any surprises, you want to know the position you will be in at all times.

The upcoming Fifty Shades Of Grey film is expected to have several raunchy love scenes 

How long does it take to film a love scene?

You do more than one take but you get there in the end.

I have never done something longer than a day. The longest I have done it for is half a day.

Do you do a lot of dieting and exercise to prepare for your body being naked on camera?

As an actress you have to keep yourself pretty trim anyway, so maybe just a few extra sit ups in the days leading up to it.

Are there any tricks to make it look more realistic?

From the side is always a really good angle because you get the silhouette and you can imply a lot from a side angle.

But there isn’t really any way of getting around being close to each other, you just are.

There is a make-up artist there to make sure it looks realistic enough, so if they want it to look hot and sweaty then they will spray some oil.

Does anyone ever do pranks?

Yes, you have to because you have to lighten the mood as it is quite intense when you’re in that situation.

So you do things like drawing smiley faces on your pasties, so that when he takes your bra off, he gets a funny shock, that sort of thing.

You have to lighten the mood and do a lot of fun with it.

How do you fake an orgasm face?

Well I always ask the director what he sees the character doing, because the director knows a lot about the character.

But you also know if they are a shy person, or really outgoing, or what the relationship is with this person.

So is it that character’s husband, or are they somebody you shouldn’t be sleeping with, I think that is kind of generally shows how you would portray a climax scene.

It’s not like where porn stars just scream and that’s that, there’s a lot more to it.

Do you think Hollywood love scenes are creating an idea that is impossible for a person in real life to achieve?

I don’t think so. All of my love scenes have been very normal. I don’t think they have been abnormal ways of intercourse.

Maybe people confuse porn that way because porn is unreal but we don’t do that.

The only thing that I would say is that after sex in a film, everyone lies around looking beautiful whereas in real life that doesn’t tend to happen.
