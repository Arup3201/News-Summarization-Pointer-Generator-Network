Convicted: Hussain has macular degenerative disorder and can only see a for few feet

A registered blind man led police on an 85mph car chase through a city centre in the dead of night a court heard.

Mulazum Hussain, who can only see for a distance of a few feet, refused to stop for officers when they signalled for him to pull over at 3.30am, sparking the five-mile high-speed chase.

The visually impaired driver sped over roundabouts, ignored signs and bollards and was going so fast that his Vauxhall Corsa left the ground at one point and did a 360 degree spin.

The 21-year-old also went through several red lights in a bid to escape.

A second police car was needed to bring Hussain to a halt as he raced the through the Handsworth and Attercliffe areas of Sheffield.

The driver even tried to ram a police car after he had been boxed in but he was eventually forced to give up.

After he had been blocked, Hussain tried to trick officers into believing that he wasn’t driving the vehicle, using his short sightedness as an excuse.

As traffic police approached the car, he moved into the passenger seat and claimed his cousin was driving, although officers had only seen one person inside.

Sheffield Crown Court heard how he told police; ‘It wasn’t me driving. I can’t see. I’m blind.’

Route: during the five mile chase, Hussain hit speeds of 85 mph and even performed aerial jumps to try to lose police

Hussain suffers from macular degenerative disorder so he can only see a few feet in front of his face.

At the hearing on Friday, he admitted dangerous driving and driving with no insurance and was jailed for nine months.

Recorder
Jeremy Barnett told him; 'You pleaded guilty to the most awful piece of
driving. It was highly dangerous, aggravated by you being only 
partially sighted.'
