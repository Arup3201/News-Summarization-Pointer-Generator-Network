A Wisconsin billionaire has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of having sexual contact with a teenage girl.

Samuel 'Curt' Johnson III, whose family has run home-products giant SC Johnson for five generations, was convicted of fourth-degree sexual assault and disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to four months in jail, short of the one-year maximum. He was also fined $6,000.

Before sentencing Friday, the 59-year-old apologized to the victim and her mother for 'the tremendous hurt I have caused.'

Judge Eugene Gasiorkiewicz allowed the downgrade of charges. Then he sentenced Johnson to four months in jail, short of the one-year maximum. Johnson was also fined $6,000.

The plea deal also means the married father of four children will not have to register as a sex offender.

Johnson was charged in 2011 with indecently touching a girl when she was aged between 12 and 15 years old.

According to JS Online, the case had been bogged down over a request by Johnson's defense team that the girl, now 17, be asked to turn over notes from her therapy sessions before she be allowed to testify against Johnson.

A trial judge had proposed that the girl be allowed to testify but make the jury aware that she had declined to make her therapy records available to the judge, ad therefore they could presume the records would have been beneficial to Johnson's case.

In March, however, the Court of Appeals rejected that option and ruled that the girl could not testify unless she allowed a judge to see her mental health records.

The girl refused to allow a judge to see her therapy session notes and therefore was not allowed to testify.

Without her testimony, prosecutors had little chance of achieving a conviction on such serious charges for Johnson.

Plea deal: The billionaire will serve four months in prison and pay a fine of $6,000

According to JS Online, the case grew out of Johnson's statements to his own therapist, who was required by law to report potential child abuse to authorities.

Johnson's family founded and runs the SC Johnson home products company, but he has not been affiliated with the conglomerate for 18 years, a company spokesperson told MailOnline.

He was the chairman of the Diversey, Inc subsidiary of the company but resigned in 2010 citing 'personal reasons.' The company was bought in 2011 by Sealed Air.

Johnson is estimated by Forbes to be worth about $3 billion.
