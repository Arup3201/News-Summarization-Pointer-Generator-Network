A 28-year-old man has been extradited to Australia from Malaysia charged with stabbing a Chinese chef to death at a take-away shop in southern NSW, eight years after the crime was committed.

The accused murderer allegedly killed shopkeeper Deng Chi Li on September 13, 2006.

The 51-year-old victim was found at the back of Noodle Paradise eatery, which he part-owned, in Baylis Street, Wagga Wagga, with multiple stab wounds.

Extradited: The 28-year-old allegedly killed shopkeeper Deng Chi Li on September 13, 2006. His body was found inside the Noodle Paradise shop

After years of investigation by NSW police an extradition request was lodged with Malaysian authorities in March.

Officers arrested the 28-year-old man in Malaysia and he was flown back to Sydney under police guard on Saturday.

He will spend the night behind bars before facing Parramatta Bail Court on Sunday.

His body was found after staff at Noodle Paradise discovered the shop was locked.

Noodle Paradise is in the city of Wagga Wagga, southern NSW. Mr Li reportedly owned 70 per cent of the business

A locksmith helped officers gain entry where they found the body of the manager slumped in the back.

Mr Deng had been a Chinese chef his whole working life but had only been in Wagga for between six and eight months.

A friend of Mr Li, Peter Lin, described the chef as a 'good man' shortly after his body was found.

He told the Daily Advertiser: 'Li was a very good man, I don't understand why it would happen to such a good man, he wouldn't have even known many people in Wagga.'

Flown back: NSW police officers escorted the man from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia to Sydney

Strike Force Nuggetty, comprising of officers from the Wagga Local Area Command and the State Crime Command's Homicide Squad, were in charge of investigating the murder.

Detective Sergeant Dale Holmes said in a press conference in March that Mr Deng's family were pleased to hear the news of the arrest.

The man has been charged with murder, malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, aggravated robbery with wounding, robbery armed with an offensive weapon, robbery, stealing and malicious wounding.
