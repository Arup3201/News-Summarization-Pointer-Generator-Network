A young snowboarder in Montana was fined after his friend posted a video of him chasing a moose down a ski slope.

Charlie Rush, 21, of Flathead County, has to pay $250 to the Flathead National Forest Service for animal harassment.

His friend, Hunter Lamoureux, 15, unintentionally got Rush in trouble by posting the 52-second video of their extreme wildlife encounter at the Whitefish Mountain Resort to Facebook.

The moose is on the loose! Charlie Rush, 21, of Flathead County, is seen on his snowboard right on the tail of a galloping moose

Fined: Charlie Rush, pictured in both photographs, was fined $250 for 'animal abuse' after he snowboarded down a slope chasing behind a moose. But he says he didn't do anything wrong

It shows Rush snowboarding down the ski trail with a moose galloping in front of him.

The video had the caption: ‘Just chasing a moose while snowboarding...no big deal.’

But officials did not agree.

‘We do have regulations about harassing wildlife and this video fell under that,’ forest spokesperson Wade Muehlhof told local station KRTV.

Muehlhof said the citation was issued to the snowboarder chasing the moose for a learning opportunity because the fierce animal could have seriously injured one of them.

‘At the end of the video, you notice that the moose stops and turns. That could have had a very bad outcome for the snowboarder. We're very happy that neither the moose nor the snowboarder were injured,’ he said.

'Dangerous': Officials say the two could have got hurt by the animal which is much bigger than them and has been known to attack when it feels threatened

According to the two snowboarders, however, it was not their fault.

‘Look,
 the moose was in the middle of the run where it wasn't supposed to be 
and we were where we were supposed to be,’ Lamoureux wrote in a Facebook
 post.

‘After waiting for it to move, it didn't. So we finished out our 
run trying to slip past it. And the moose kept running.’

'Not my fault': Rush says he plans to contest the fine to clear his name as he claims he would never hurt an animal

Huge animal: Rush says he never realised how big moose are until he was snowboarding right behind one

Rush,
 who is reportedly considering contesting the citation, told CNN that he
 loves moose and would never intentionally hurt an animal.

‘I never realized how big they were till I got that close to one,’ he said.

John Fraley, a spokesperson for Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks, told the New York Daily News that these sorts of encounters ‘threaten the animals and threaten the people’.

‘Just try to minimize any contact you have with the wildlife out there,’ he said.
