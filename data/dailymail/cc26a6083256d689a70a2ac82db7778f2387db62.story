Andrew Mitchell was ordered to pay costs of £300,000 by January - but he may face a total bill of more than £2million

Disgraced former chief whip Andrew Mitchell has paid £300,000 in legal costs for his failed Plebgate libel trial, it was confirmed today.

The Tory MP was ordered to pay after a high court judge threw out his attempt to sue the owners of The Sun newspaper for its claim that he called police officers 'plebs' at the gates of Downing Street.

Mr Justice Mitting ruled that the former Cabinet Minister did call police officers 'f****** plebs' when they refused to let him cycle through the main Downing Street gate in 2012.

The judge ordered Mr Mitchell to pay costs of £300,000 by January - but he may face a total bill of more than £2million.

After launching his bid to sue the Sun newspaper Mr Mitchell was counter-sued by Metropolitan Police PC Toby Rowland - on duty on the night of the confrontation.

The officer sued Mr Mitchell for claiming he he lied about the version of events.

Mr Mitchell has paid £150,000 in costs each to the Police Federation & News Group Newspapers.

A court will decide next week the whether Conservative MP must pay more in costs or any damages.

Mr Mitchell's career was left in ruins in November last year after Mr Justice Mitting ruled the MP had called police officers 'plebs'.

He said he was 'satisfied at least on the balance of probabilities that Mr Mitchell did speak the words alleged or something so close to them as to amount to the same, including the politically toxic word pleb'.

The judge said PC Toby Rowland, one of four officers on the gate, was 'not the sort of man who would have had the wit, imagination or inclination to invent on the spur of the moment an account of what a senior politician had said to him in temper'.

Mr Mitchell, who was educated at Rugby School and Cambridge University, had just been promoted to Government Chief Whip when the row unfolded in September 2012.

The judge also rejected 'absurd' claims by millionaire Mr Mitchell that the three police officers stood at the Downing Street gates, pictured, conspired to discredit him.

When officers refused to open the main gate for him, he shouted: 'Best you learn your f****** place. You don't run this f****** government. You're f****** plebs.'

Mr Mitchell – who repeatedly denied calling the officers 'plebs' – resigned a month later as the scandal engulfed him. He is highly unlikely to ever hold a post in the Cabinet again.

During the case the MP's lawyers submitted a plethora of statements from celebrities and leading politicians who said they had never heard him use the word 'pleb'.

But it emerged that he has been accused of a pattern of insulting and high-handed behaviour towards officials on at least 16 occasions dating back to 2005.

He was described as 'Jekyll and Hyde' figure who used a 'mixture of charm and menace' to keep Tory MPs in line. Yesterday a barrister said Mr Mitchell, 58, was the 'architect of his own misfortune' who has shown 'a total lack of contrition'.

Andrew Mitchell has been accused of high-handed behaviour at least 16 times dating back to 2005. Those outlined to the High Court included:

NOVEMBER 2005:Mr Mitchell tried to cycle through a heavy gate into Black Rod's garden as it was being closed by a security guard. Lee Bryer shouted 'stop' several times but the MP ignored his requests and cycled through.

Mr Bryer caught up with Mr Mitchell and asked him why he did not stop. Mr Mitchell allegedly said: I'm an MP and I'm too important to stop for you. Stop being so aggressive, you little s***.'

MAY 2011: The MP arrived at the main gate of Downing Street on his bicycle and told officers: 'Let me in. I'm a Cabinet MP and I'm late for a meeting.' PC Bruce Smart had no idea who he was so phoned the control room at No 10.

He said: 'The custodian told me that although allowing him access this way was against security policy, denying him entry would be more trouble than it was worth, and so I should just let him in.'

JUNE 2011: For a second time Mr Mitchell had a confrontation with PC Smart at the Downing Street gates – but this time the officer refused to let him through due to 'security reasons'.

When Iain Duncan Smith arrived by car the officers had to open the main gate. They finally allowed Mr Mitchell through after a polite request from Mr Duncan Smith. As Mr Mitchell cycled through, he allegedly said: 'Bruce Smart, is it? You shall be hearing about this. Don't think you've heard the last of this – I'm going to make a complaint to the Commissioner.'

The MP demanded full disciplinary proceedings be brought against PC Smart. The officer said: 'During both my encounters with Mr Mitchell his behaviour was arrogant and rude.'

JUNE 2011: PC Joseph Withington was on duty at Downing Street when Mr Mitchell allegedly shouted 'chop, chop' as officers opened the main gate for him.

The MP is then alleged to have said: 'Always helps if you do this as rapidly as possible – we're all in a hurry.' PC Withington told the court Mr Mitchell used a 'condescendingly rude tone', adding: 'It's completely unnecessary, patronising and sarcastic to be spoken to like that.'

AUGUST 3, 2011: When Mr Mitchell arrived in Djerba, an island off the coast of Tunisia, during his stint as International Development Secretary, he told his protection team he wanted to travel to Libya.

Inspector Duncan Johnston, who ran the team, told him such a trip was not possible as it would breach international law. Mr Mitchell allegedly replied: 'That's a bit above your pay grade, Mr Plod.'

Inspector Johnston said he found this 'rather insulting, discourteous and demeaning'.

AUGUST 17, 2011: Two weeks later Mr Mitchell 'launched into a foul-mouthed tirade' at members of his protection team when a trip from Kenya to Somalia was changed for security reasons.

Inspector Johnston said: 'He used a tirade of language that … was just swearing for the sake of swearing.'

Mr Mitchell demanded to know how many officers had been sent to Kenya in advance of him and allegedly accused them of treating it as a holiday.

He allegedly said: 'British taxpayers are funding this for police officers to sit by the pool.'

EARLY SEPTEMBER, 2012: On one visit to Downing Street Mr Mitchell had to cycle through the pedestrian gate, rather than the main gate.

He shouted to officers: 'I'm coming through that gate next time.' PC Michael Penton said: 'I found Mr Mitchell's behaviour to be rude and condescending.'

SEPTEMBER 18, 2012: On the night before 'Plebgate', Mr Mitchell allegedly shouted: 'I'm the Government Chief Whip. I want to leave through these gates.'

PC Gareth Bonds said: 'During this exchange I stood and watched in disbelief at how childish a grown man in his position was being and found it embarrassing.

'I therefore spoke to my colleagues and told them to just open the gates as it was ridiculous to argue over a gate. I found Mr Mitchell's tone overbearing.'
