Peter Hayler (pictured with his wife Jean) has been ordered to pay £250 compensation to a 14-year-old boy he punched in the face

A former school governor who punched a teenage boy in anger as he defended his home from vandals has been ordered to pay him £250 compensation.

Peter Hayler, 58, was also landed with a criminal record after he snapped and confronted the 14-year old-boy when police failed to act over damage to a dry stone wall.

The victim, who was punched in the face, was left with broken teeth, and two black eyes.

Although prosecutors accepted there was a 'background of antisocial behaviour' they said the assault on the unnamed boy was 'unprovoked'.

Hayler, of Newchurch, Lancashire, who served as a Labour councillor for Rossendale Borough Council in the late 1990s, later appeared in a magistrates’ court and was convicted of battery. He was also fined £300 as well as the compensation order.

Details of the case emerged for the first time as the grandfather lost his appeal against his conviction at Burnley Crown Court.

He told the court he thought the boy was going to spit at him, and claimed the teenager raised his right arm with the intention of hitting him.

Hayler said he responded by instinctively striking a blow with his right fist.

Judge Ian Leeming, sitting with two justices, threw out the appeal, despite 'impressive references' from former MPs and the former leader of Lancashire County Council, Hazel Harding, and ordered Hayler to pay further costs of £620.

The judge said: 'He did punch and cause these far-from-trivial injuries, not in self-defence. We are sure he did not believe he was about to be attacked.'

The former councillor said the old dry stone wall was repeatedly vandalised

Peter Hayler said his conviction was 'absolutely amazing' and said his family was 'disappointed' at the verdict

But speaking after the hearing, Hayler a former governor at Crawshawbooth and Waterfoot Primary Schools branded his conviction 'absolutely amazing'.

The grandfather, whose wife Jean is also a former Rossendale councillor, said: 'Our family are all disappointed at the verdict.

'In law, a jury would convict only if
there was overriding evidence of guilt and any doubt would deem the 
defendant as not guilty.

'The youths were witnessed vandalising my 
property, but have lied about the extent of the vandalism.

'The police have been ineffectual in investigating a series of vandalism, despite numerous calls from my wife.

'The
fact that I have been arrested, and subsequently convicted of assault 
by battering, is absolutely amazing as I have no previous convictions 
for any offence whatsoever.

'I feel that it is reprehensible that
the police have chosen to pursue the victim of anti-social behaviour in
favour of a group of vandals,' he added.

Earlier the court heard how vandals had caused costly damage to the wall in the weeks before the assault in May last year.

Reports had been made to police, but no action had been taken and Hayler lost his temper.

Prosecutor
Bob Sastry accepted there was a 'background of antisocial behaviour' 
regarding the wall, but there was no evidence that the boy in question 
was involved.
