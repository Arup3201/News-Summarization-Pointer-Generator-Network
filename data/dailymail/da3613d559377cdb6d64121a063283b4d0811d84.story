The Vizconde von Hoehen de Bessarabia once enjoyed the hospitality of the finest hotels in  the world. Among his favourites was the SLS boutique hotel in Beverly Hills.

On his blog, The Viscount’s Table, he advised readers: ‘Always insist on Ace of Spades champagne. Two bottles by the rooftop pool at the SLS in Beverly Hills is highly recommended for good living.’

The Vizconde also enjoyed some agreeable stays at the Roxburghe Crowne Plaza and Sheraton Hotel in Edinburgh, where he noted that staff ‘served the most beautiful spring tea to the Viscountess and I in the room’.

Kirk Brown aka Vizconde von Hoehen de Bessarabia, lived a life of luxury at the expense of his in-laws after convincing them he was a Moldovan Viscount deprived of his birthright

Indeed, wherever he went, von Hoehen was treated with the reverence due a member of an obscure but noble family in Moldova in Eastern Europe.

He was, to borrow a description of him by his admiring father-in-law, a ‘most noble fellow’.

Except he wasn’t a nobleman at all, but a conman previously known rather less exotically as Kirk Brown.

He persuaded his mother-in-law and his wife’s uncle to invest hundreds of thousands of pounds in a number of phoney business ventures.

In a blog post the Viscount claimed that Ace of Spades champagne, which sells for £300 a bottle, was his favourite

Their money was placed in an offshore account called Bessarabia Sovereign Holdings.

Von Hoehen’s breaks at luxury hotels in the UK, America and Europe — and his favourite Ace of Spades champagne, which retails at £299.95 a bottle — were paid for with this money. This month, 46-year-old Brown began a 40-month jail sentence for his fraud.

His crimes have been uncovered but one mystery remains: how on earth did he get away with it?

Let us consider for a moment what image is conjured up when one thinks of a Moldovan viscount. A tall, dashing figure with a dangerous glint in his eye and an air of the rake about him?

Yet in the dock at Blackfriars Crown Court stood an overweight, balding bloke with a goatee beard and a tie as dodgy as his title.

Presumably he must have been a very convincing storyteller.

The Vizconde’s tale was that he was a member of a Moldovan dynasty whose lands in Bessarabia along the Black Sea coast had been confiscated during the communist era.

The family had fled to Canada and, when he was old enough, he claimed he left home and moved to Spain, where he studied at the Instituto De La Empresa Barcelona. From there, he travelled to London.

At some point, he changed his name by deed poll, using the Spanish Vizconde instead of Viscount as a nod to his sojourn in Spain.

No one seemed to consider how odd it was for a Moldovan nobleman to have a Spanish title, a German name and speak with a Canadian accent.

In London, the Vizconde met his wife-to-be, a pretty Australian-born blonde called Jodi Young, then 27 and working as a personal assistant.

Deprived of his birthright, the Vizconde had to settle on marrying his bride at Lambeth register office and moving into a flat in Streathham, South London, and later to another flat in Peckham, an equally incongruous location for a Moldovan nobleman. In 2009, the couple moved to Shoreditch.

On his marriage certificate, the Vizconde was named as one Perran Kasp. He gave his occupation as restaurant consultant (he was later to tell friends he had once been a Michelin-starred chef).

His father was named on the document as Neil Brown, a chief executive officer. How he managed to explain to his university-educated wife that his late father was not also a Kasp or a von Hoehen, or whatever, is a mystery.

Brown recommended ordering a bottle or two of the bubbly while on the terrace of the SLS hotel in Beverly Hills (pictured)

The Vizconde told Jodi that the von Hoehens had managed to keep much of their fortune out of the communists’ hands — and one day, he promised, it would all be theirs.

For the first few years of the marriage, it is not clear what the Vizconde did for work. Perhaps he did nothing. After all, that is the prerogative of the highly born, is it not? Presumably, the Viscountess had to go out to work.

Jodi’s family were rather in awe of the nobleman their daughter had married. In a note to him written in January 2010, his father-in-law, Bruce Young, began with the words: ‘Most noble fellow, Perran.’

It was around this time that the Vizconde told his wife’s family that a £400  million inheritance would be coming his way soon.

In anticipation of this happy event, the Vizconde instructed Phil Spencer, the property expert on Channel 4’s programme Location, Location, Location and Kirstie Allsopp’s sidekick, to find him a nice London house.

‘I wasted a lot of time on him,’ recalls Mr Spencer. ‘We went to view a £14 million house in Russell Square and he was talking about where the servants would live and where the Bentley would go.

'There were lots of discussions, but it came to nothing. I refused to put an offer in on the property until I was reassured all the finances were in place, but that didn’t happen.

‘He was very plausible — a very pleasant man — and a terrible name dropper. He said he knew Tom Cruise and Barack Obama . . .

The Vizconde also boasted to friends of his plans to buy a private jet to make travelling less onerous.

Brown even went so far as to contact TV estate agent Phil Spencer to buy a £14million house in Russel Square which he claimed could be bought with a £400million inheritance windfall

Then he began discussing a number of business ventures with his in-laws. He spoke to his wife’s uncle, Richard Birch, a high-profile Australian who helped coordinate the opening ceremonies for the Beijing and Sydney Olympics.

The Vizconde offered to invest some of the money from his ‘inheritance’ in a new company to be set up between himself and Mr Birch.

First, though, he asked for £50,000 from Mr Birch to give him preference shares in the company. The Vizconde also told Mr Birch he had control of a shipping container company based in the Seychelles and asked him for £56,000 to buy new containers.

Then he asked Mr Birch to hand over a further £10,000 to be used in a venture with a fictitious Bulgarian stockbroker.

The Vizconde also persuaded his wife’s mother, Nicki Young, to part with £150,000 to invest in the same shipping container business. As we know, much of this money funded the Vizconde’s holidays and meals at expensive restaurants.

As well as fine dining, von Hoehen said he also had ambitions to become a novelist, and needed cash to set up a company to publish a book.

In June 2010, Black Mary Press Ltd was born and in 2011 his debut novel, The Black Sea, came out under the name VP von Hoehen.

In an interview on a book review blog, he said the inspiration for The Black Sea was ‘based on my own family’s struggle to get back what was rightfully ours prior to the communist takeover of Moldova’.

But by now this elaborate web of deceit was beginning to unravel. Mr Birch and Mrs Young, concerned that the schemes they had invested in were not making any returns, had begun asking questions.

Despite their expensive lifestyle Brown and his wife Jodi Young lived in a flat in Peckham before moving to Shoreditch (file picture)

To allay their fears, von Hoehen sent them faked bank statements. He then told Mr Birch that one of his employees had emptied the contents of his bank account and donated them to the Taliban.

This was an absurdity too far. It is believed that at this point Mr Birch alerted the police.

Von Hoehen was arrested. After the arrest, he moved to a flat in Farnham, Surrey. In the past month or so he has been seen out and about in the town sporting a floppy leather hat with a feather in it.

On his arm at a local restaurant recently was a woman with dark hair with purple streaks in it. She told staff it was ‘one of her first dates’ with him.

Unsurprisingly, it seems the Vizconde’s marriage to Jodie, the ‘Viscountess’ has collapsed and this week she could not be traced.

Last month, von Hoehen’s case was heard at Highbury Magistrates Court and moved to Blackfriars Crown Court for sentencing.

The court heard that his  mother-in-law, Nicki Young, a 68-year-old grandmother who lives in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, has been forced to return to work as a primary school supply teacher to pay off her debts.

Giving evidence, she said: ‘I treated him as a son. It was not just that he was a friend to me, he was family, and that’s why I didn’t question his investing my money for me.

‘I probably came close to a nervous breakdown. I was very foolish and trusting. These were my life savings. He seemed very calm and said, “I’m sorry, I’m a congenital liar, it’s like a gambling addiction.”’

Von Hoehen, wearing black jeans and a tatty black coat, pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud by false representation. He listened intently to the proceedings, but remained impassive throughout.

Just a few days earlier, he had eaten out at a restaurant in Farnham. Instead of his ‘Vizconde’ title, he made the reservation under the name of Brown — the game, he knew, was up.
