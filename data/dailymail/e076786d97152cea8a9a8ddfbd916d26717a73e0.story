It is the high octane, adrenaline-fuelled extravaganza that injures - and sometimes kills - hundreds of of people a year and has been branded cruel by animal welfare groups.

But in extraordinary scenes today, the annual bull-running festival of San Fermin - made famous by Ernest Hemingway's novel, The Sun Also Rises -  showed it has lost none of its lure, as thousands of people packed the streets of Pamplona to mark the start of nine days of blood and gore.

Bedecked in white and holding the traditional vivid red scarves, a writhing mass of humanity basked in blazing temperatures as they prepared for the traditional launch of a firework that signals the release of the bulls.

Sea of humanity: The square in Pamplona is packed with thousands of people ahead of the start of the nine-day bull-running festival of San Fermin

Riot of colour: A glorious sea of red means it only one thing in Pamplona - bulls

Defiant: Concerns over animal welfare were ignored by the throng of people who flock to Basque city every year for perhaps the most famous festival in Spain

Packed in tight: Revelers kick off the event with a party ahead of the launching of a rocket to mark the release of the bulls

United: Several thousand people hold up the traditional red scarf as they celebrate the beginning of the festival

Hedonistic: Passions run high for one couple, right, while a group of men get into the spirit of things, right

The party was delayed briefly after suspected nationalists draped the Basque flag over the city hall.

Six 100-stone bulls and six steers from are set free from their corral and a crowd of revellers will then run for nearly a kilometre through the city, ending up at the bullring.

There are absolutely no hiding places. Workers erect 12-feet barriers along the route, and many participants push their luck too far. Around 200 are injured during San Fermin each year, and the bull runs have claimed 15 lives since 1924, with the most recent death, that of a 62-year-old Spaniard, occurring in 2003.

Tradition: Revellers gathered in Ayuntamiento square, in Pamplona, to mark the start of the famous festival

Red and white: People gathered in the square are covered in red paint and consume red drinks

Party: A man is held aloft above the crowd, where everyone has come dressed in white

The issue of animal rights has long gone hand-in-hand with San Fermin. The bulls that take part in the run each morning are killed by bullfighters in the evening, usually in a slow and torturous manner. 

Ahead of this year’s edition, one of its most high profile opponents has been Benjamin Zephaniah, the writer and poet.

Writing for the Guardian’s Comment is Free section, he argued all visitors to the festival have 'blood on their hands'.

Euphoria: Animal rights groups have denounced the festival as cruel but it remains as popular as ever

Fountain: Festival-goers cool off in Ayuntamiento square

Glorified: Ernest Hemingway featured the festival in his 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises

Leap of faith: A reveller jumps from a fountain at the Plaza de Navarreria as he is sprayed with water during the start of the San Fermin festival

Regional pride: Proceedings were delayed when a Basque flag that was planted on the town hall was removed

Colourful: Pamplona was turned into a sea of red, as hundreds of tourists joined locals to celebrate the festival made famous by Ernest Hemingway

Full to capacity: Every vantage point was taken as crowds flocked to get a look in on festivities

Having a ball: These people have 'blood on their hands' according to Benjamin Zephania, who says the suffering experienced by bulls at the festival is cruel

'Tourists who participate in the run or visit Pamplona simply to watch it contribute to the carnage,' he said.

'Every shared tapa, every cerveza, every booked hotel room and balcony bolsters the killing. As long as the city makes money off the event, bulls will continue to suffer and die.'

'Tormenting and butchering bulls for entertainment belongs to the dark ages – not the 21st century.'

The League Against Cruel Sports, a charity, blamed 'lads magazines' for 'sensationalising the event... playing up the braveness' of the human participants, and glossing over 'the reality as to how the bull run ends'.

But there are signs Spain's treatment of the animals could be changing after Catalonia became the second Spanish region to ban bullfighting, following the Canary Islands.
