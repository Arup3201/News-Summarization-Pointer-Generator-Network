Drug dealer Craig Allen, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, had convictions dating back to 1975 and 'thought he was above the law'. He now faces 20 years in jail

An ‘untouchable’ drugs baron who ran a worldwide heroin and cocaine dealing ring from a mansion in Thailand is facing prison today after being arrested at IKEA.

Craig Allen, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, had convictions dating back to 1975 and 'thought he was above the law'.

But now, the 50-year-old - nicknamed the 'ginger ninja' and 'little fella' - has been jailed for 20 years.

His drugs operation made him £5,000 a week, which was used to fund a lavish lifestyle at the luxury estate he shared with his Thai wife and child.

However, his empire crumbled when he was arrested at gunpoint - outside IKEA in Amsterdam - by Dutch police last October, and then extradited to the UK.

When police searched his Dutch flat, they found 3kg of cocaine, 1kg of heroin, €425,000 (£350,000) in cash, scales, a cash-counting machine, rubber gloves, a vacuum-packing machine and other drugs paraphernalia.

DI Craig Jackson from South Yorkshire Police, who led the investigation, said: 'Craig Allen is a sophisticated and determined drug trafficker who was directly responsible for the supply of Class A drugs onto the streets of South Yorkshire and across the UK.

'Much of Allen’s criminality was orchestrated from Thailand and the Netherlands and was undertaken by his UK-based co-defendants in a highly organised manner.

'He thought he was above the law, untouchable, and operating in a jurisdiction like Thailand gave him a degree of anonymity.

'But South Yorkshire and England will be safer places with Allen behind bars, there is no doubt.

David Brooke, prosecuting at Sheffield Crown Court where Allen pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial to conspiracy to import and supply heroin, and conspiracy to supply cocaine, said Allen was caught after five police operations in 2010 and 2011 which linked him to heroin and cocaine supply.

In total, 24kg of Class A drugs worth around £1.85million were seized at locations around South Yorkshire and from two drugs mules who flew into Liverpool from Amsterdam with drugs hidden in their bodies.

Allen was caught after South Yorkshire Police linked five Class A drugs operations to him primarily through mobile phone evidence.

They discovered that in each case, Allen was at the helm, directing the delivery of drugs and exchange of cash in the UK to organised crime groups from his Thai mansion.

He used up to 20 mobile telephones to conduct his operation. In the period covered by the police operations, nearly £200,000 was wired to Thailand. Officers linked each of Allen’s co-defendants back to him.

The court heard Allen has previous convictions dating back to 1975 when he was a juvenile.

Between then and 1988, he committed dishonesty offences and in 1991 he was one of eight men who broke out of a prison bus in Sheffield while on remand for armed robbery and deception.

The guards were manacled inside and the prisoners fled, sparking a national manhunt. Allen was captured after four months.

In 1993, Allen was jailed for 12 years and six months for supplying heroin and amphetamines.

He was jailed again in 2001 for two years for conspiracy to supply cannabis. Then in 2003 he was acquitted of involvement in the murder of Sheffield music promoter Lester Divers, who was shot dead at the wheel of his car.

Allen fled to Spain with his then wife and son to make a 'fresh start' due to 'serious threats against him'.

Allen’s barrister Adrian Waterman, QC said he tried to make a fresh start and worked as a painter and decorator - a profession in which he was formally trained.

His wife returned to the UK with their son, but Allen was unable to go with her because of the threats against him and visited a friend in Thailand where he settled.

'It was irresistible to him not to stay away from a return to his old ways,' said Mr Waterman. 'He was safer associating with other drug dealers than living a more conventional life. He fell back into the drug-dealing world.'

He said Allen became a 'middle man' arranging the transportation of drugs on behalf of others.

He left Thailand in 2010 for Amsterdam because he owed money to drug dealers, leaving behind his new Thai wife Kanya Plaengdee, whom he married in 2010, and their young child.

Det Insp Jackson added: 'Craig Allen was directing and controlling the supply of Class A drugs into the UK for distribution in England and Wales from the other side of the world.

'He was Sheffield born and bred but his reputation extends far beyond Sheffield. He’s a very well-known figure.

'We worked with Dutch colleagues to identify his whereabouts and arrest him. He certainly wasn’t expecting it. He had no idea that we were on to him at all.'

He said Allen’s arrest had been ‘a long time coming’.

'The investigation team have worked long and hard to see Craig Allen sentenced for his extensive criminality,' he added.

'I wish to personally thank the team of officers involved in this complex and protracted investigation for their tenacity, professionalism and drive to produce a methodically prepared case.'

Allen and three co-defendants were jailed for a combined total of 61 years after admitting conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.

O’Neil Richard Davidson, 36, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, was sentenced to eight years in prison.

Steven Hudson, 43, of Sheffield, received a nine-year jail term.

Selena Nickels, 45, of Sheffield, was sentenced to six years behind bars after she pleaded guilty on February 27.

Leroy Grant, of Manchester, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs following a two-week trial. He was sentenced to 18 years.

Brian Saunders, 48, of Sheffield, will be sentenced at a later date.
