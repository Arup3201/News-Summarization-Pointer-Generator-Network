The fact that humans live beyond their reproductive usefulness has long been thought to be a biological process that uniquely separates us from the great apes. 

But the discovery of an orangutan going through menopause could nullify that theory - and suggest we’re not so dissimilar after all.

Gina, an orangutan at Durrell Wildlife Park in Jersey, was being tested for breeding when scientists found she was no longer fertile. previously thought almost exclusive to humans.

Gina, pictured here with her baby Jaya, is the first ape found to have undergone a menopause. This biological process was originally thought to be exclusive to humans. This suggests humans are not as dissimilar from orangutans as first thought

The research will feature in Channel 4 documentary series Born in the Wild on 22 June.

Durrell Wildlife Park is located on the island of Jersey in the English Channel.

It was founded by naturalist and conservationist Gerald Durrell in 1958, then called Jersey Zoo.

Gerald passed away in 1995 but is survived by his wife Lee, who now runs the park.

Since then the park has grown enormously with almost 200,000 visitors passing through its gates every year.

It is also heavily involved in the conservation and protection of endangered species through the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust.

This international charity works globally to save species from extinction.

Gina is a wild-caught female that was confiscated from smugglers at Singapore airport in the 1960s, and has been a resident at Durrell since 1968.

In those 46 years Gina has given birth to seven babies, most notably the male Jaya in 2004, who was born by caesarean section - the first such procedure carried out on an orangutan.

Almost a decade after Jaya’s birth, the now 49-year-old Gina was being considered for breeding.

Female orangutans are widely believed to remain fertile until the end of their lives, rather than undergoing a menopause, as seen in humans with whom they share 97.6 per cent of the same DNA.

Before making the decision to breed with her, Gina was scheduled to be fully health-screened to establish whether she could safely contribute another genetically important youngster to the captive breeding program for her species.

In addition, her reproductive status was assessed and these procedures coincided with the filming of this episode.

Gina was being prepared for breeding when it was found that she had undergone a menopause. The finding was made during an ultrasound examination (pictured) that showed the tell-tale signs of a post-menopausal reproductive system

However, whilst anaesthetised, vets noticed one facet of Gina’s assessment was unusual.

During the ultrasound examination carried out by Neil MacLachlan, Consultant Obstetrician at Jersey General Hospital, Gina’s uterus, endometrium (lining of the uterus) and vagina unexpectedly displayed tell-tale signs of what - in a human patient - would indicate a post-menopausal reproductive system.

A further series of blood tests affirmed that Gina is believed to be the world’s first medically-confirmed case of an orangutan that has undergone a non-pathological age-related cessation of reproductive abilities - a menopause.

“I suppose that I’m not totally surprised to find that orangutans have a menopause - they really are so very similar to humans,’ said MacLachlan.

‘Indeed it looks as if they go through the menopause at a very similar age.

‘Now the orangutans are living longer, we will probably see more in the menopausal state, and this will allow breeding programmes to be better managed.

‘Gina has really been an informative animal and I hope she can now relax a little from being such a wonderful mother.’

The programme also features the Durrell staff’s footage of their 25-year-old orangutan Dana giving birth to her first surviving baby.

This is the most detailed - if not the world’s first - footage of an orangutan birth.

Following a stillbirth in 2009 that almost cost her life Dana had been considered infertile.

However, MacLachlan’s pioneering work to clear Dana’s blocked Fallopian tubes resulted in a pregnancy in 2012.

Staff at Durrell, determined to ensure Dana and baby would survive her 2013 delivery, watched her around the clock.

As a result they were present, with cameras rolling, when she went into labour late one June evening.

We are incredibly fortunate to have the support of our collaborative medical colleagues on Jersey,' said Durrell’s Head Vet, Andrew Routh.

'Working with the team at the Wildlife Park we have, together, been able to make huge advances in the reproductive health care and breeding management of these incredible apes.'

Durrell hope that the new findings broadcast in this programme will further compel people to speak up for orangutans, and support their conservation, before they are lost from Earth forever.

McLachlan added: ‘Realising how close to humans the orangutans are, I just wish that the rest of  mankind would give them the same respect that they deserve and the support to live in peace, in their own environment; surely their basic civil rights?‘
