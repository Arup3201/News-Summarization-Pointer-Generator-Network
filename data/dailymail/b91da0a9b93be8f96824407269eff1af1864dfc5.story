Dannii Minogue’s hair became the top talent on Australia’s X Factor on Tuesday night after the star judge appeared on the show apparently wearing a wig.

The 41-year-old singer’s signature short hair style had been ‘replaced’ by flowing dark locks.

The new look sent social media buzzing, with many of her fans speculating she was wearing a hair piece and ruling out hair extentions, with one writer commenting: ‘You have such beautiful hair. Why go the wig?’

Spot the difference: Dannii Minogue was spotted with short hair when arriving at Melbourne Airport, but when she appeared on the X-Factor she appeared to be sporting a wig

Sydney style commentator Melissa Hoyer said Dannii  - the sister of pop diva Kylie Mingoue -  was ‘on trend’, with wigs becoming a staple for many celebrities.

Joan Collins and Tina Turner perfected the art of wearing wigs, while more recently by Sharon Osbourne, Beyonce, Adele, Lady Gaga and J-Lo have donned a fashionable hair piece.

‘I think it is fantastic that a style-oriented and savvy woman like Dannii can wear a wig and make it look cool,' wrote Hoyer.

‘It’s usually got nothing to do with a personal hair issue or bad hair situation It’s more like a great way of giving a celeb a new look with the help of a great hair stylist in the space of a few minutes.'

She added: ‘If it is a good quality wig - some even feature “roots” so they look even more authentic - and it suits your face shape, then why not take the easier option?

It’s not the first time Dannii has been seen with long hair. She appeared in promotional shots for the show in April with a similar full length style -  just over a week after she had been seen on a Barbados beach with much shorter hair.

That short style was still in evidence when she arrived in Australia later that month with her cropped hair peeking out from underneath a bowler hat at Melbourne airport.

Then fans, who had seen those arrival pictures followed by the promotional shots showing Dannii’s long locks, were left in no doubt she had taken to a wearing a toupee - no-one could have grown hair that quickly.

The wig and the gown mum-of-one Dannii wore for the promotional shots left fans in no doubt that the X Factor -  as seen on TV on Tuesday evening  - was not live, but had been recorded three months earlier.
