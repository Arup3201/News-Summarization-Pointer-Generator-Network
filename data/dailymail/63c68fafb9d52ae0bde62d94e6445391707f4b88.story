When Jodi Gholson Oliver's 19-year-old told her that he was going to live as a transgender male, the Las Vegas mom took to Facebook to let her family and friends know how proud and accepting she was of her child.

'For about 18 1/2 years we thought he was a girl, who just happened to like bugs, tattoos, flames, skulls, snakes, lizards, etc, etc,' Mrs Gholson Oliver wrote on her Facebook wall March 27.

Last September, Jesse Oliver, born 'Jessica' but known to everyone as 'Jes,' came to his parents and revealed that he's never felt like he was supposed to be a girl and always identified as a male.

Inspiring message: The Las Vegas mother of two wrote a smart and touching Facebook post letting her family and friends know that  her 19-year-old son is transgender

'This is something that we have all seen over the years and I am so happy that he can finally feel like the person he was born to be!' Oliver's mother added.

To drive the point home, the mother of two supplemented her post with a picture of a cartoon stork wearing an 'It's a Boy' cap. 

While the witty and heart-warming Facebook post was meant to simply keep Gholson Oliver’s family in the loop about a major development in her son's life, it quickly became much more than that, as Daily Dot first reported.

The message has gone viral, drawing more than 150 ‘likes’ from loved ones and supportive strangers alike, who praised the Las Vegas hairdresser for embracing her child's life-altering decision.

The mother, who has since joined the Gender Justice Nevada group, was surprised by the public’s reaction to her Facebook statement. 

‘I had no idea this was going to affect so many people like it has,’ Gholson Oliver wrote in a follow-up post. ‘My hope is that in a short time this topic can just be small talk over coffee.’

Then and now: The Las Vegas teen was born Jessica Oliver (left) 19 years ago, but he has always known that his real gender was male

Jes Oliver then shared his mother's message on his Tumblr page, adding, 'Heck yeah, mom,' at the bottom.

The post quickly exploded online, and Oliver’s page has been overwhelmed with more than 150,000 comments from other Tumblr users.

Over the past week-and-half, Oliver has been responding to questions from curious Internet users about what it means to be FtM transgender - female to male.

Photos on Jes Oliver's Facebook and Tumblr account depict a masculine-looking teenager with piercing blue eyes, short dark hair and oval face with a cleft chin. He has an 18-year-old girlfriend, Hailey, who calls herself ‘Jesse’s girl’ on her social media account. 

Real identity: Jes Oliver got a new birth certificate late last year and has since begun going to gender therapy sessions

Although he was born with female reproductive organs, Jes Oliver has always known that it was the wrong gender for him. The 19-year-old also has a younger sister, Juliana.

An old photo from their childhood, which Oliver shared online, shows the two sisters smiling into the camera, with Jes on the right rocking a black Harley-Davidson baseball cap turned backwards.  

In response to a question from a Tumblr user, the 19-year-old explained that when he was in the sixth grade in Missouri, where the family are originally from, he was pretending to be a boy on a drawing website and chatting with girls online.

'My mom found out and questioned it, but the conversation only went like “if you’re gay that’s okay me and dad still love you,”' Oliver wrote, adding that despite his parents’ positive attitude, he denied being gay 'to the end of time.'

Then last September, the Las Vegas teen finally came out to his parents and friends as a transgender male.

The family quickly set the wheels in motion, applying for an official name change. Last December, the former Jessica Oliver got a new birth certificate with the correct gender - male.

The outspoken and inspiring young man, who describes himself as a ‘pretty decent dude,' has been blogging about the process of his transformation.

Supportive: Miss Gholson Oliver has joined the Gender Justice Nevada group to raise awareness of transgender people like her son

A few months ago, Oliver began attending gender therapy sessions. The goal is for him to eventually obtain what is called a T letter - a letter of recommendation for hormone replacement therapy.

One of the things he enjoys the most is when people use male pronounces when addressing him. Oliver was especially overjoyed when his mother took to referring to the teen as a ‘he.’

‘The other day my mom told me she’s gonna start trying harder to use male pronouns and I’ve even heard her use ‘em when she’s around me,’ Jes Oliver gushed.  ‘Hot diggity dog, that’s cool.’
