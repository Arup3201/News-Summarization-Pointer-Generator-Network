Delaware governor Jack Markell was apologizing this afternoon after mistakenly tweeting a photograph of a woman in bondage gear.

His office  tweeted the racy photo accidentally while publicizing a public education initiative.

The photo, showing a blonde woman wearing a black leather collar around her neck, was soon deleted and replaced with an apology.

Markell tweeted after the incident: 'An inappropriate photo was inadvertently sent out earlier,

'We are looking into how this occurred but apologize to anyone who was offended.' 

Markell on Thursday announced more than $5 million in state funding to help turn around six struggling Wilmington schools that are the lowest-performing district schools in the state.

While using an online social networking system to compose a tweet about the announcement with a photo, a Markell staffer inadvertently deleted part of the photo link.

The result was a photo that apparently was posted in 2010 by a model who goes by the name 'Precious Little.'

Markell's office quickly deleted the tweet and apologized for the error, saying it would have been nice if the accidental link had been a cat video. 

This apology tweet was posted after the accidental bondage photo was posted in Gov. Jack Markell's page
