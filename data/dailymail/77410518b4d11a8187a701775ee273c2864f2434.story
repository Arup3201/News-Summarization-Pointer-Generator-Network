Ten years of patience and star-gazing by astronomers has finally culminated in this incredible image showcasing around one billion stars in the Milky Way.

It was produced by scientists who combined infra-red light images from two telescopes in the northern and southern hemispheres.

Astronomers from the UK and Chile gathered the data which was then processed and archived by teams at the universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge.

Star-filled sky: This incredible image, shows in detail, the star forming area in the Milky Way. Scientists produced the picture by combining infra-red light images from two telescopes in the northern and southern hemispheres

They have now made it available to 
studies around the world and hope it will change the way scientists 
carry out future research.

Dr Nick Cross, of the University of Edinburgh's school of physics and astronomy, said: 'This incredible image gives us a new perspective of our galaxy and illustrates the far-reaching discoveries we can make from large sky surveys.

'Having data processed, archived and published by dedicated teams leaves other scientists free to concentrate on using the data and is a very cost-effective way to do astronomy.'

Dr Cross said the archived information on the billions of stars, known as the Vista Data Flow System, will allow scientists to carry out research in future without needing to generate further data.

As well as being published online the image is being presented at the National Astronomy Meeting in Manchester today and shows the plane of the Milky Way galaxy from Earth's perspective.

It combines data from the UK Infrared Telescope in Hawaii and the Vista telescope in Chile.

Astronomers used infra-red radiation instead of visible light to enable them to see through much of the dust in the Milky Way and record details of the centre of the galaxy.

The work was supported by government body the Science and Technology Facilities Council.
