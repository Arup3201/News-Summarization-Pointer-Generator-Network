The peace of an idyllic Utah canyon will be broken today as hundreds of ATV riders gather to use a trail they have been barred from since 2007.

In a row that echoes that of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, the riders are challenging a Bureau of Land Management warning for them to stay away.

The protesters have been told they could face prosecution if they take to the trail, which is home to 2,000-year-old Native American burial sites and cliff dwellings.

Utah governor Gary Herbert said he understood the frustration of ATV riders who are banned from a trail that is open to hikers and those on horseback, but he urged protesters not to break the law or disrupt public safety.

The protest is the latest illustration of tension between Western residents and the federal government over management of public lands.

But the off-road protest isn't expected to end in a confrontation like other recent ones.

The BLM doesn't plan to block access or confront the riders, San Juan County Sheriff Rick Eldredge, who has been briefed on the agency's plans, said.

The agency will, however, document those who ride ATVs on the prohibited trail, he said.

Fight back: San Juan county commissioner Phil Lyman says the BLM is acting like a 'supreme authority'

Protest: County commissioner Phil Lyman has urged ATV riders to rally, as Utah governor Gary Herbert called on protesters to be peaceful and not break any laws

San Juan 
County Commissioner Phil Lyman said he expected hundreds at a city park 
for a morning rally but only a handful to ride on the restricted trail.

He has drummed up interest on social media but isn't recruiting militant types.

Lyman,
 whose family has been in the region for four generations, said the ride
 is a demonstration of his disgust with the federal government's 
overreaching control of public lands.

'They are not the supreme authority,' Lyman said.

Recapture
 Canyon is home to dwellings, artifacts and burials left behind by 
Ancestral Puebloans. A gurgling stream in the canyon likely drew them as
 it does outdoor enthusiasts today.

Environmentalists
 and Native Americans say the ban is needed to preserve fragile 
artifacts. Navajos claim the people who lived there and are buried there
 as ancestors.

'Those 
ancient sites are the equivalent to churches,' Mark Maryboy, a former 
Navajo Nation Council delegate, said. It's very disappointing that they 
have no respect for Native American culture.'

Landmark: The canyon is home to ancient ruins and burial grounds which are culturally important to Native Americans

The
 canyon outside the city of Blanding is about 40 miles northwest of the 
junction of Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, known as the Four 
Corners.

The protest comes amid high tension over BLM practices.

Last
 month, the BLM had a standoff with militants in Nevada over a dispute 
about the roundup of rancher Bundy's cattle. The BLM ultimately stepped 
down.

Utah ranchers and county leaders recently threatened to break federal law and round up wild horses this summer if the BLM doesn't do it first.

Earlier this week, a BLM employee in Utah was threatened while driving on the highway by two armed men who were holding a sign that read: 'You need to die.'

The federal government owns two-thirds of Utah's land. The Republican-dominated Legislature passed a law in 2012 that demands the state be given control of those lands before 2015, excluding national parks.

Motorized access to Recapture Canyon and other wilderness areas has long been a source of tension. ATV riders rode another off-limits trail in 2009 in a protest. No charges were filed.

Lyman believes it is possible to reopen the canyon to ATVs while preserving the artifacts.

But Jessica Goad of the Center for Western Priorities disagrees, pointing out that ATV riders blew their chance when authorities discovered two men used picks and shovels to create an off-road recreational vehicle trail in the canyon before the 2007 ban was in place.

The BLM says that more than 2,800 miles of trails are open to ATVs on public lands within a short drive of Blanding.

Pat Shea, a former national BLM director and attorney in Salt Lake City, said acts of civil disobedience put federal agencies in a difficult position.

To prevent injuries and bloodshed, they must avoid clashes and work to de-escalate situations, but coming off weak brings its own consequence.

'It's a real policy dilemma because people begin to believe they can be the law into themselves,' Shea said. 'Then why should people stop at red lights?'
