Jermain Defoe's hat-trick gave Tottenham fans even more to sing about after the Metropolitan Police reassured them they will NOT face prosecution for using the word 'Yid' in matchday chants.

London's police force agreed with the club and their supporters that the 'Yid Army' songs are not anti-Semitic.

Spurs fans often sing songs featuring the expression, and did so during their Europa League clash against Slovenian side Maribor at White Hart Lane, where a stunning treble from Defoe gave them a 3-1 win.

'The club does not tolerate any form of racist or abusive chanting.

'Our guiding principle in respect of 
the "Y-word" is based on the point of law itself - the distinguishing 
factor is the intent with which it is used ie if it is used with the 
deliberate intention to cause offence.

'This has been the basis of 
prosecutions of fans of other teams to date. Our fans adopted the chant 
as a defence mechanism in order to own the term and thereby deflect 
anti-Semitic abuse. They do not use the term to others to cause any 
offence, they use it a chant amongst themselves.

'The club believes that real 
anti-semitic abuse such as hissing to simulate the noise of gas chambers
is the real evil and the real offence. We believe this is the area that
requires a determined and concerted effort from all parties and where 
we seek greater support to eradicate.'

Before kick-off, a smattering of 
supporters in the South Stand sang 'Yid Army' and, after a third-minute 
corner for Spurs, the chant grew louder with the whole end joining in.

Then, in clear protest at the 
criticism levelled at them, Spurs fans from all corners bellowed: 
'We're Tottenham Hotspur, we'll sing what we want.'

Another round of 'Yid Army' then followed.

The club released a statement 
defending their fans' right to use the expression. It read: 'Our guiding
principle in respect of the "Y-word" is based on the point of law - ie.
if it is used with the deliberate intention to cause offence. 'Our fans
adopted the chant as a defence mechanism in order to deflect 
anti-Semitic abuse. They do not use the term to cause any offence, they 
use it as a chant among themselves.'

The Met have advised Spurs that 
chants such as 'Yid Army' will not lead to prosecution on the basis that
it is used with no 'deliberate intention to cause offence'.

The Society of Black Lawyers 
threatened to report Spurs to the police if they were not seen to be 
doing more to ensure the term is no longer used.

Hat-trick hero: Jermain Defoe

As a youngster growing up supporting Spurs, it took me some time to realise the word 'yid' was an offensive racial slur. I'd never heard it used in a derogatory sense at White Hart Lane, only ever as a collective term - yid army - and as a positive identifier.

If a player was good, he was a yiddo.

But its significance soon became apparent. Though far from the abhorrent gas chamber hissing of some away fans, it's still sensitive. Context is important, though, and its reclamation as a positive term at the ground should not be ignored.

The Society of Black lawyers says use of the word yid, including the tone adopted by Spurs fans, amounts to casual racism. Perhaps they have a point. Perhaps simply substituting the word would be the answer. But Spurs fans are unlikely to take kindly at being told what to do by an external body, especially as it is largely considered a positive, rather than offensive, chant.

David Baddiel tried to stamp out its use by Tottenham supporters but, despite his own Jewish faith, the views of a Chelsea fan were never likely to be accepted by the Spurs majority.

If the word yid really is to be kicked out of White Hart Lane, it would need concerns to be raised from within the Spurs-supporting community, rather than outside pressures.
