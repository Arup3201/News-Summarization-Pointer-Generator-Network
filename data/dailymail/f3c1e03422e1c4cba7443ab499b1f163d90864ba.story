Lone voice: The cockerel was branded a potential 'noise nuisance' by his local council after one neighbour complained

When a new resident arrived in a picturesque village, it didn’t take him long to ruffle a few feathers.

For rather than fitting in with the ways of country folk, the townie moaned about the noise – from Reg the rooster.

He complained to the council, only to find villagers flocking together to support the much-loved cockerel.

Now the newcomer and his wife have moved out, much to the relief of residents in Sutton Poyntz, near Weymouth, Dorset.

The unnamed couple were upset by the 
noise being made close to their detached £450,000 home at 5am every day 
and the husband made an official complaint about Reg to Weymouth and 
Portland Council.

Council officials warned blacksmith Simon Grant-Jones,
who owns the rare exchequer leghorn cockerel, that they had a duty to 
investigate.

They said checks would be made to see if the bird’s crowing
was excessive – and if it was, enforcement action could be taken under 
the Environmental Protection Act.

But the threat sparked a village 
revolt, starting with a petition that was launched at the local coffee 
morning. It was signed by 160 people – more than half the villagers.

Such was the ill-feeling towards the 
newcomer, villagers say, that he went into hiding. He and his wife have 
since sold their home and moved out of Sutton Poyntz, meaning the 
complaint is no longer valid.

Mr Grant-Jones, who has had Reg for 
more than two years, said yesterday that he was relieved the threat to 
his rooster had been lifted.

Close-knit: Outraged villagers launched a petition at a local coffee morning to make sure that Reg was not removed

‘I am glad it is all over. I was 
overwhelmed by, and very grateful for, the support for Reg,’ he said. 
‘Hearing a cockerel crowing in a rural  village is part and parcel of 
living in the country.

'The villagers got quite upset about this one 
complaint and the threat that Reg would have to be removed. I think the 
guy went into hiding.

'Never underestimate the power of the coffee 
morning.

‘He has since sold his house and has 
moved out. I telephoned the council to tell them this and was told that 
there would be no further action against Reg.’

Mr Grant-Jones, 49, who lives with his
wife Lyn, a midwife, and their two children, buys two roosters each 
year for the table but has kept Reg because he is a rare breed and 
protects his hens.

'Ways of the country': Owner Simon Grant-Jones, left, said he was glad the stand-off was all over and things had gone back to normal in Sutton Poyntz, right

‘Reg has gone from strength to strength and is now 
the proud father of 30 chickens and is a bit of a local hero,’ he said 
proudly.

Bill Egerton, chairman of the Sutton 
Poyntz Society, said: ‘I was horrified when somebody objected to a 
cockerel crowing. As a society we do try to preserve the village feel of
the place and having a cockerel crowing is a part of village life.

‘I didn’t know the guy who complained but some people felt incensed by the complaint.

‘His was a point of view that wasn’t shared with the rest of the village.’

A spokesman for the council confirmed that the complaint has now been dropped.
