Supports bill: 68-year-old actress Jane Asher

She has worked tirelessly to raise money for those with terminal illnesses.

But when it comes to her own life, Jane Asher has revealed she would have no hesitation visiting euthanasia clinic Dignitas if she ever found herself suffering from an ‘unbearable’ and incurable condition.

The actress, 68, has backed plans to legalise assisted suicide in the UK and said ‘anyone with a humane bone in their body’ should also support mercy killings.

Her intervention comes as peers prepare to scrutinise the Assisted Dying Bill, promoted by for-mer labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, in a House of Lords committee.

Miss Asher told the Daily Mail: ‘It is so difficult, but if I had to come down one side or another I’d say yes, that particular law should go through. I know all the problems of course. It doesn’t seem to have had the problems overseas that the worriers keep raising.

‘Personally, yes, my God, of course. It is hard to imagine anyone with a humane bone in their body wouldn’t want to stop terrible suffering.’

She added: ‘I think the general public are changing their mind. A lot of these high profile cases have confronted people with what suffering is. I would absolutely take myself off to Dignitas if I thought I was going to be in unbearable pain, definitely.’

It is the first time Miss Asher, who starred opposite Sir Michael Caine in the hit 1966 film Alfie and famously dated Sir Paul McCartney, has publicly stated her views on assisted suicide.

She and the former Beatle once studied with Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of transcendental meditation, but she now says she is not religious ‘in any way whatsoever’.

The actress, who has three children with her husband, illustrator Gerald Scarfe, 78, used to be a member of the British Humanist Society, which also supports euthanasia.

But she says she left the organisation long ago, adding: ‘I think a rationalist is a better description of me. I believe in scientific values foremost. I’m not religious, not at all.’

Miss Asher is currently supporting Macmillan Cancer Support in collaboration with supermarket chain Poundland. She has endorsed a new bakeware range for Poundland and is supporting its efforts to raise funds for the charity, which provides nurses and support to cancer sufferers.

She is also president of the National Autistic Society and of Parkinson’s UK, which she joined after learning that her brother-in-law Gordon suffers from the degenerative condition.

The star – who as well as being an actress is an accomplished baker with more than a dozen cookery books to her name – insisted she does not deserve special credit for her charitable ef-forts, but said she is glad to help good causes where she can.

She said: ‘If you’ve got any sort of name obviously you get asked to do lots of stuff. And while you’re still able to it’s nice to do something good, if it helps raise money.’

Miss Asher admitted she was less sure about linking her name to Poundland at first, because of its reputation for cheap goods, but said she changed her mind.

She said: ‘When they first approached me, my reaction was “Oh, I’m not sure about this at all.” I thought it would be cheap stuff which I didn’t like and I didn’t think they could ever make a range which I would genuinely buy and use.

‘But I was surprised by how good the products are. I use them in my own kitchen, especially the non-stick tins. I know that I’m deemed to be upmarket because of my accent and the roles I’ve played, which makes my connection to Poundland surprising and also very clever.’

She added: ‘My accent has changed over the years. Not consciously. I haven’t done a reverse Margaret Thatcher. But when I listen to recordings of myself as a child I sounded very smart in-deed. I sounded like a prim Victorian young girl. I have never felt typecast because of my accent though.’

In 2010, the Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu spoke out against celebrity-backed cam-paigns to legalise euthanasia, saying: ‘I would rather listen to the voices of disabled people than to the voices of celebrities or the voices of 1,000 people in an opinion poll.’

But despite warnings that it could lead to widespread killing of the sick, the momentum to change the law has increased in recent years.

Last month, West End composer Andrew Lloyd-Webber revealed he recently considered using Dignitas after suffering a deep bout of depression triggered by the pain from a series of opera-tions, but changed his mind and now feels it would have been a ‘stupid and ridiculous thing to do’.

TV presenting couple Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan also recently revealed they had made a ‘pledge’ to help each other die if they were suffering from an incurable disease.

Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in the UK, technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison, although guidelines issued in 2010 indicated that anyone acting with compassion on the will of a dying person is unlikely to face charges.
