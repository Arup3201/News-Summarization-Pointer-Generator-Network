Mike Tindall couldn't disguise the after-effects of a tiring trip to Hong Kong to play rugby in the intense heat on Saturday, as today he appeared to nod off during the celebrations to mark 60 years since the Queen's Coronation.

The former England captain, who is married to Zara Phillips, the Queen's eldest granddaughter, had his eyes closed on a number of occasions during the short service at Westminster Abbey.

Days earlier the centre joined the Barbarians team as they played against the British and Irish Lions, but this morning he was paying the price, as he was persistently rubbing his eyes, giving the impression he might be severely jet-lagged.

His tiredness seemed so obvious that at one point Queen's son Prince Edward appeared to point to bags under his own eyes while Prince William giggled while looking at his cousin's husband.

He was evidently feeling the jetlag from the near-12 hour flight back from the Far East, where he played for the Barbarians against the Lions in their first warm-up match ahead of their Australian tour.

The Gloucester and former England centre joined the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and more than 20 royals, including the heavily pregnant Duchess of Cambridge and her husband Prince William, for the religious service.

The Queen was crowned on June 2, 1953
 at Westminster Abbey. During his address, the Archbishop of Canterbury 
Justin Welby described the Queen's life as one of 'demanding devotion 
and utter self sacrifice - a path she did not choose but one she was 
called to.'

Tindall played 20 minutes for the Barbarians in their 59-8 defeat to the Lions on Saturday.

The 'Baa-baas' broke with their long-standing tradition before the match by implementing a self-imposed ‘booze ban’ to enhance their chances of upsetting the Lions.

In the aftermath of their abject 40-12 defeat against England at Twickenham three days earlier, Dai Young’s players chose to stay off alcohol for the rest of the week.

Their decision went against the invitational team’s age-old pre-match routine, with its heavy emphasis on ‘bonding’ drinking sessions
