A woman was pulled aside at the St. Louis airport last week when TSA agents found something they believed too dangerous to take on a plane: a sock monkey’s tiny toy gun.

Phyllis May of Redmond runs a small business making the classic toys and was on her way home Wednesday when the security agent seized her bag.

‘She said “this is a gun,”’ May said. ‘I said no, it’s not a gun it’s a prop for my monkey.’

Better days: Phyllis May's sock monkey Rooster Monkburn had its toy gun confiscated by St. Louis airport TSA agents last week. Here, the monkey is pictured with its gun in the holster

'This is a gun': The TSA insisted that 'If I held it up to your neck, you wouldn¿t know if it was real.' Here, a photo provided by Mays shows tiny size of her monkey's gun

The level-headed explanation did May no good, reports King5.com.

‘If I held it up to your neck, you wouldn’t know if it was real or not,’ the TSA agent told her.

May says she was told the tiny guy, about the length of three quarters, would have to be confiscated.

She was also told the police were supposed to be called in such instances.

‘And I said really? You’re kidding me right, and she said no, it looks like a gun,’ said May.

Are invisible planes next? May runs a small business making the classic toys and says she was 'appalled and shocked and embarrassed all at the same time' over the December 3

Has justice prevailed? 'Rooster Monkburn has been disarmed so I’m sure everyone on the plane was safe,” May joked. 'I understand she was doing her job but at some point doesn’t common sense prevail?'

A shocked May replied: ‘Well go ahead.’

Luckily for May, the agent didn’t follow through. The police were never called but the monkey—named Rooster Monkburn as a nod to the John Wayne character in 1969’s True Grit—had to proceed unarmed.

‘Rooster Monkburn has been disarmed so I’m sure everyone on the plane was safe,’ May joked. ‘I understand she was doing her job but at some point doesn’t common sense prevail?’
