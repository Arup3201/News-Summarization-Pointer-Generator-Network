Images have been released allegedly showing rockets being fired from Russia into Ukraine, and heavy artillery being rolled across the border to be used by pro-Russian rebels in the country's ongoing civil war.

The U.S. government released the images today, which support claims that Russia has been providing heavy arms to rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk - parts of Ukraine under separatist control.

A four-page document released from the State Department seems to show blast marks from where rockets were launched and craters where they landed.

Officials said the images, sourced from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, show heavy weapons fired between July 21 and July 26.

'Proof': The U.S. State Department release and annotated the above image, dated almost a week ago. It seems to show rockets within Ukraine - and therefore operated by the rebels - firing rockets at Ukrainian positions close to the Russian border

'Shelling Ukrainians': The above image, taken on Wednesday shows Russian artillery vehicles firing over the border towards a Ukrainian position, which is surrounded by shell holes

Such evidence will also fuel suspicions that the rebels could have been given a surface-to-air missile by Russia which was then used to shoot down flight MH17 near the Russian border more than a week ago.

The theory is widely accepted by Western powers, but the rebels in Donetsk have defended themselves from the charges by claiming they had no weapons which could possibly reach high enough to touch a passenger jet at 33,000ft. 

The U.S. images claim to show multiple rocket launchers fired at Ukrainian forces from within Ukraine and from Russian soil. One shows dozens of craters around a Ukrainian military unit and rockets that can travel more than 7 miles.

In a memo attached to the images, U.S. officials said: 'The wide area of impacts near the Ukrainian military units indicates fire from multiple rocket launchers'.

'Russian-backed attacks': The above before-and-after image purports to show a Ukrainian unit after it has been shelled by separatists

Tensions have run high around Ukraine since Russia seized Crimea in March. Washington has also been highly critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin's behaviour concerning the handling of the MH17 crash, as well as the rest of the conflict in Ukraine.

More recently, U.S. intelligence officials have said they have what they call a solid circumstantial case that Russian-backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine are responsible for downing the Malaysia Airlines plane.

Citing satellite imagery, intercepted conversations and social media postings, officials say a Russian-made SA-11 surface-to-air missile hit the plane on July 17.

Moscow angrily denies any involvement in the attack.

U.S. officials said they still don't know who fired the missile or whether Russian military officers were present when it happened, and had previously declined to share any proof that the separatists had the technology to down a plane.
