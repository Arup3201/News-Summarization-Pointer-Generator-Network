The management of a popular Melbourne live music venue have published a video of drunken vandals trashing the roof of their building in an effort to track them down.

Video was taken of the three men, who seem to be under the influence of alcohol, climbing across the roof of the building and launching wooden planks, a large bucket and even a disused kitchen sink from the building housing The Old Bar, a music venue in Fitzroy, in Melbourne's inner north.

Their destructive trail on Sunday morning as prompted a barrage of criticism on social media.

The unknown cameraman has obviously spied the vandals from above the building and dutifully recorded their trail of wreckage.

The three men were filmed above the Old Bar roof as they stood on top  pulling apart items of the roof and throwing it on to the ground below

The men are visibly struggling to keep their feet as they cross the stumble across the roof. One falls in a heap and is forced to call for a friend to help him up because he can't get off the roof.

The footage of the men was handed to the pub's management and then posted on The Old Bar's Facebook page.

The overwhelming majority of those who commented on the action were disgusted.

In a fiery post, accompanied by the footage, The Old Bar management have asked the public to help identify the 'c*** pockets' seen clambering along the roof top and throwing items on to the lane way below.

A post, accompanied with the photo of the three, also reads: 'Anyone know any of these 3 pr***s that just destroyed part of our roof? Please share it around because we would love to have a chat with them ASAP.'

Friends of this man have already made their escape off their roof as he stands their waiting to throw a wooden beam off

Music media website, Tonedeaf, said the footage was filmed on Sunday afternoon.

Facebook user Tristan Davies said the building was built in the early 19th century.

'It was built in 1902 according to the parapet on the matching corner next door,' he posted.

He and other local supporters of the live music venue have already rallied behind their online search, which had reached more than 364 shares on Facebook.

The Old Bar spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia while it is 'not that dramatic,' the pub's social media page has been an effective tool in helping track culprits down in the past.

'In the past when something has happened and we have used social media to try and resolve the issue it has generally worked.'

'As we haven't heard anything from these guys by now we doubt we will.'

He said the priority now is fixing the roof, and if they find the culprits than that it is an added bonus.

'If only our posts for gigs received 200+ comments and the amount of media attention these d**** have,' the spokesperson said.
