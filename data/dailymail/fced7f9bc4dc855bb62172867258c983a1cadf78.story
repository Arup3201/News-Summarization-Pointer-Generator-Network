The families of two public school runaways last night said they were ‘sick with worry’, as police on the Caribbean island they had fled to admitted they could be ‘anywhere’.

Edward Bunyan and Indira Gainiyeva, both 16, sneaked out of their school early on Monday before flying to the Dominican Republic.

Indira’s father, a wealthy businessman in Kazakhstan, was said to be growing increasingly concerned as his daughter and her boyfriend have switched off their mobile phones and have not been in contact since leaving the UK.

A family friend said: ‘Both families are sick with worry but are staying in touch with the Dominican authorities and hope it is resolved soon. 

‘Indira’s father just wants to speak to his daughter but both their mobile phones have been switched off all week.’

Edward’s mother, Susannah Bunyan, 56, is understood to be on her way to help the search. Mrs Bunyan, a widow, was said to be boarding a flight from her home in Spain last night.

Friends have said the sixth-form sweethearts are believed to have been enjoying a five-star break on the island and there are fears  they could be at risk if they flaunt their wealth.

But local police in Puerto Plata admitted yesterday they had no leads on the couple’s whereabouts and they could be ‘anywhere’. 

Officers said they were only alerted by the British Embassy yesterday morning and had not been contacted by police in the UK. They have contacted the major resorts in the area but have been unable to locate the young lovers.

Staff at the £30,000-a-year Stonyhurst College in Clitheroe, Lancashire, realised they were missing only when they failed to turn up for school register

Colonel Andres Perez Martinez said: ‘We are going to check the entire area in Puerto Plata. But if we can’t find them here we are going to expand the search across the country.

'We will not stop until we find them. All countries have bad areas and they have to be careful if they are wearing expensive jewellery or watches which might put them at risk from robbers.

‘But they should be safe as long as they are sensible. It is not especially dangerous here.’ 

The teenagers began their three-day adventure by fleeing their school at 3am on Monday morning before catching a taxi to Manchester Airport. From there, they flew first to Paris and then on to the Dominican Republic.

Staff at the £30,000-a-year Stonyhurst College in Clitheroe, Lancashire, realised they were missing only when they failed to turn up for school register that morning. Andrew Johnson, headmaster at the mixed-sex day and boarding school, said that although the school has tight security ‘this is not a prison and we do not put bars on the windows and doors’. 

Michael Mostyn, second master at the school, added that security measures were designed to keep intruders out, not pupils in.

 A schoolfriend said yesterday: ‘Eddy and Indira are school legends and the place is absolutely buzzing after their daring escape.’

Many pupils took to social media – using the hashtags WheresBunyan and WheresIndira – to try to find news of their friends.
