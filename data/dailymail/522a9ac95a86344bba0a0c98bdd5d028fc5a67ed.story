 A 15-year-old who wanted to join Islamic State as a jihadi bride has been revealed to be the fifth girl from Bethnal Green Academy trying to join the extremist group.

The teenager, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was stopped from joining the Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria by police on the runway at Heathrow after her plane was grounded.

The girl went to the same east London school as Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, who fled to join IS fighters last month, the Sunday Telegraph reported.

She boarded a British Airways flight to Istanbul on December 6, without the knowledge of her parents, months before her schoolmates made their successful attempt.

Her plane was held as it taxied for take-off and was turned around at the last minute.

All four of the aspiring jihadists followed their friend Sharmeena Begum who first went to the Middle East to join IS. All of the girls knew each other well.

The unknown Bethnal Green Academy pupil was one of five others from the school to be given travel bans to stop them from going to Syria this week.

The court orders showed a total of eight students from the same Academy in Tower Hamlets had showed an interest in Islamic fanaticism.

A judge banned five girls – three of whom are 16 and two 15 – from travelling abroad after they showed an interest in going to Syria.

He ordered their passports to be taken off them and for them to be made wards of the court.

Despite repeated claims by the families of the teenaged girls now in Syria  that they had no idea of their children’s plans, it emerged, also this week, that the father of Amira Abase held extremist views.

In 2012 Abase Hussen marched on the US embassy with hate preacher Anjem Choudary and one of the murderers of Fusilier Lee Rigby.

He was pictured burning an American flag but had spoken emotionally of his daughter’s disappearance, issuing aplea for her safe return.

Later, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen, denied even knowing what Islamic radicalisation was.

Last month he gave evidence to Parliament, refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls’ actions, instead seeking to blame the police, teachers, Turkish officials and others.
