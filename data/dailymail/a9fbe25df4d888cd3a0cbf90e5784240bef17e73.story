Play for England at the World Cup? I need to learn how to play union first 

I hung up on Gladiator Russell Crowe the first time he called

I lived in an apartment owned by Russell Crowe and went to the beach every day... My time in Australia was a dream 

For Burgess, life as a Pom playing in Australia is the fantasy which came true. From the moment he flew out there on his 21st birthday, he revelled in his new environment.

‘I’d gone from West Yorkshire to Sydney; this great city, where it was red hot, I was going to the beach every day, playing golf four times a week and playing professional rugby league. I was living my dream,’ he said. 

‘I lived in this apartment — Russell Crowe owned it — which looked out over the harbour bridge and the opera house. I used to go back after training, lie down on the day-bed on my balcony and fall asleep.’

Sam Burgess reveals his loved every minute of being an Englishman playing in Australia

He soon made his mark on the elite rugby league scene Down Under and was quite surprised that he did not receive more stick for being an exiled Englishman.

In fact, when his three brothers all ended up joining him at the Rabbitohs, the Burgess boys were made to feel right at home.

‘The Souths people really embraced the English, especially when we were all there,’ he said. ‘They used to do a Union Jack in red and green — the team colours. They could see that we were patriotic. We even had Union Jack speedos! I would love to have played in State of Origin, but that would have meant giving up my England jersey and that’s something I could never have done.’

Once Burgess decided to cross codes, his final season in NRL became a quest to help his club win their first title in 43 years.

Fired by a sense of destiny, he played the whole Grand Final last month in agony after fracturing his cheekbone and eye socket in a first-minute clash of heads with compatriot James Graham.

‘I wasn’t even meant to be there,’ he said. ‘Three or four minutes before kick-off, the coach asked me to swap positions, then the ball came straight to me in the first play and I collided with James. I knew I couldn’t come off, but there was blood coming down the back of my throat and I was choking on it.

‘We got to half time and as I walked down the tunnel, my girlfriend, her family and my mum were all there. I looked up and saw that they were so worried, so I just shook my head and said “I’m sorry”. My girlfriend told me later that she was saying, “It’s alright, just keep playing” but I didn’t see that at the time.’

Burgess did just that and etched his name into NRL folklore with victory. ‘I played 97 games for South Sydney and I would love to play 100 games for them,’ he said. ‘Never say never.’
