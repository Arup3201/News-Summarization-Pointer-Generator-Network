A three-time convicted rapist who spent 33 years on the run will finally face justice today.

Gary Allen Irving, Massachusetts' number one most dangerous fugitive, is scheduled to appear at a Maine courtroom for the start of extradition proceedings this morning.

He is being held after police finally tracked down the violent sex attacker to an address in Gorham, Maine, following a manhunt which has lasted for more than three decades.

Officers from Massachusetts Violent Fugitive Apprehension Squad and the FBI pounced on a home at 9.15pm last night where he had been living under an assumed name.

Officers and agents discovered a fearsome arsenal of weapons during the raid, including seven rifles, two sawn-off shotguns and a handgun,Â MyFoxBoston reported.

Now in his 50s, Irving fled Massachusetts in 1978 after he was convicted of three violent rapes in Norfolk County and sentenced to life in prison.

One of his victims was a girl of just 16.

He had been on the run for 33 years, 260 days, and was the subject of numerous public appeals for information which could offer clues to his whereabouts.

Comparison on his mug shot photos from now and from before he went on the run show how he has aged in that time - including growing a bushy beard.

It is not clear how police were finally able to catch up with Irving, but a spokesman said he had been living with a family in South Street, Gorham, under the assumed name Greg Irving.

Irving was being held overnight at a Maine courtroom before a scheduled appearance this morning to be arraigned as a fugitive.

He is also likely to face federal charges for the possession of illegal firearms.
