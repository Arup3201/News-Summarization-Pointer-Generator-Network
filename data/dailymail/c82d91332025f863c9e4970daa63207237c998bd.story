Last weekend, 'Super Saturday' saw a record 700 auctions held across Australia, continuing the housing bubble trend of skyrocketing prices offered up for questionable properties.

The weekend could have been labelled 'Super Expensive Saturday', as several of the residences which drew top dollar were so in shambles that they were uninhabitable.

This Balmain East residence which was literally crumbling down when it went under the hammer, and yet still managed to fetch $2.68 million- a staggering $830,000 over the reserve price.

The property was described as a 'blank canvas', offering 'the opportunity of a lifetime for the astute and imaginative buyer', despite the property not having a functional kitchen or bathroom.

'It certainly wasn't liveable', Belle Property agent told Fairfax.

However, the drawcards of the house were enough to sway many prospective home owners, who saw the panoramic views of Sydney Harbour as enough to take the risk of bidding on the property.

3 James Lane was bought by Balmain 'downsizers' who were reportedly planning to spend a further $600,000 renovating the residence before moving in.

The trend continued with several other properties, including an 'abandoned warehouse' at 164-166 Wilson Street, Newtown.

The residence sold for $1,725,000 on Monday, despite the new owners being threatened by the previous tenants- squatters who had made the 'dilapidated shell' their home.

The previous owner had paid a mere $68,000 for the property in 1981, and chose not to renovate before selling up last week. 

The new owners reportedly plan to transform it into two 10-metre wide family home, with dual parallel driveways.

The real estate did not disclose the reserve price, but said it was well under the selling price.

Then there's the string of Millers Point public housing properties, particular the dual properties on Fort St, which have sold for astounding prices.

Three of the four properties have sold for $1 million above the reserve price, despite aged floorboards and peeling paint tarnishing the residences.  

Despite being sorely in need of renovations, the first of the Millers Point property offered, 11 Lower Fort Street, sold for $3.95 million – $1.25 million above the reserved asking price.

The second  23 Lower Fort Street, sold for $2,685,000 – $985,000 above the reserved asking price. 

The extraordinary sale prices reflect the continuing 'price bubble', which housing analysts have predicted will continue indefinitely. 

Previously, Peter Kelahar, Director of PK Property told Daily Mail Australia that limited housing stock is driving house prices up, with the demand for more properties pushing property valuations up even further.

Kelahar advises that many agents will start their campaigns after the October long weekend.

'They're ready to flick the switch,' he said, 'They have all the photos taken and are just waiting for the right time.'

'At the moment it's a bit of a Mexican standoff, where people don't want to put their property up if they can't find somewhere to live. It'll loosen eventually, but just be aware of the trends.'
