London turned green this afternoon as Irish dancers, revellers and pets in fancy dress marched through Trafalgar Square to mark the beginning of St Patrick's Day celebrations in the capital. 

Revellers donned traditional Irish costumes as they jigged through the centre of London to the sound of ceilidh music, bagpipes and banging drums. 

There was a vivid array of colours on show, with festival-goers sporting bright wigs, outlandish hats and resplendent outfits.

The parade is the lead-up to the main event on Tuesday when 150,000 people are expected to congregate in London for the 14th annual St Patrick's party. 

It is being headed by former world champion boxer Barry McGuigan and features floats representing all 32 counties of Ireland.

The festival begins at Green Park station at noon and then meanders along Piccadilly, Lower Regent Street, the Mall and Cockspur Street before heading up to Trafalgar Square and eventually finishing on Whitehall.

It will include performances by the cast of smash-hit West End musical The Commitments, Lord of the Dance and rapper Lethal Dialect.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: 'It's a pleasure to once again be supporting one of the greatest St Patrick's Day celebrations anywhere in the world.

'Our free event in the heart of the capital is a terrific opportunity for Londoners and visitors to embrace the traditions of Ireland, and celebrate everything the Irish have given to the city and continue to do.'
