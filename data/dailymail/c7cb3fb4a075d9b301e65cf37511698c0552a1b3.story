Dismissed: Kerry Miller, 46, has lost her case claiming sexual discrimination and unfair dismissal from her role as a secretary at Burton Albion FC

A soccer PA who was said to have repeatedly burst into players’ changing rooms while they showered has lost her sex discrimination claim against the club.

Mother-of-three Kerry Miller sent photos of herself in various states of undress to some players and was alleged to have had relationships with two of them.

The 45-year-old widow from Marchington, Staffordshire, claimed she had been forced to quit her job at League Two side Burton Albion last year after being reprimanded for her actions.

But yesterday, an employment tribunal in Leicester dismissed her claim for constructive dismissal, sexual discrimination and harassment. Employment judge Saleem Ahmed ruled that Mrs Miller had been ‘the author of her own rumours’.

She refused to comment outside the tribunal and was not ordered to pay any costs.

Ms Miller also admitted to sending topless photos to 23-year-old striker Billy Kee and having a 'casual' relationship with former defender Ryan Austin, 29, who has since left the club.

Today an employment tribunal in Leicester ruled that she had been 'the author of her own rumours' and dismissed her claims.

The widow started working in a sales and support role at the club’s Pirelli Stadium in Burton-upon-Trent, Stafforshire, in September 2011 before she quit in February 2013 after a row with the chairman.

The tribunal heard how Ms Miller was a 'desperate' flirt who thrived on male attention and was viewed as a threat by Burton Albion's WAGs.

Veteran defender Aaron Webster, 32, told the hearing Ms Miller would be constantly around the players on a daily basis and at one time was 'all over' the club chairman.

Burton manager Gary Rowett - who played in the Premier League for Everton and Leicester City - told the hearing he always believed there was a 'sexual connotation' to her actions.

He said he was forced to go to chairman Ben Robinson after a senior player complained that her constantly being in the dressing room was making him feel uncomfortable.

Employment Judge Saleem Ahmed today 
told the tribunal Ms Miller had 'overreacted' by walking out of the club
 when she was shouted at by the chairman.

He said: 'Her reaction was exaggerated. It is clear that she was no shrinking violet and was not intimidated by Mr Robinson.

Billy Kee, 23 (left), seen outside court, said he was alarmed when he received images from Ms Miller after a match. She also posted photos on Facebook of her on the lap of goalkeeper and model Stuart Tomlinson (right)

Confession: The court heard she confessed to a 'casual' relationship with Ryan Austin

She was told her claim of sexual discrimination was unfounded and a male worker would have been treated the same

'She felt Mr Robinson had not respected her. That he had misunderstood her position.

'She acted immediately and ended her employment. But had she gone away and slept on it she may have changed her mind.

He
 added: 'As for sexual discrimination we accept that it may have been 
necessary for the claimant to have visited the male changing rooms.

Mr Ahmed, the employment judge, told Ms Miller her trips to the dressing room were inappropriate

'Whatever the number the fact is she had entered the male changing room when it was unnecessary.

'If she was told to go there she should have raised it with her line manager as it was clearly inappropriate.'

Mr Ahmed told Ms Miller a male employee would have been treated exactly the same.

He said: 'It is clear that the chairman’s concern was she was seeking to fraternise with the players and come in contact with them as often as possible.

'This would have been the same had she been a male employee.

'He believed it could be detrimental to the future of the club and damaging to team spirit if she was engaging in a relationship with one of the players.

'It was not because the claimant was a woman.'

On the third day of her employment tribunal, the hearing heard of allegations of rumours she had been seeing 28-year-old goalkeeper turned model and wrestler Stuart Tomlinson between September and Christmas 2012.

The court heard she posted a picture 
on Facebook of herself with Tomlinson, who the tribunal heard had worked as a 
part-time male escort, on a night out just hours after a crucial match.

Mr
 Ahmed said: 'She was in many ways the author of her own rumours. It was
 she who uploaded pictures of herself with a player to Facebook, 
starting the rumours about her conduct.

'She was seeking to be close to the players whenever the opportunity arose.

'Therefore the claims of sex discrimination and harassment must fail.'

During the tribunal, Ms Miller, a widow, claimed the chairman Ben Robinson suggested she wanted to work at the club so she could 'find a new husband' which he strenuously denied.

Ms Miller, who lives in a £400,000 home in Marchington, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, refused to comment outside the tribunal.

She was not ordered to pay any costs.
