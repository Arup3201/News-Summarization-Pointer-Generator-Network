A mother-of-one who sued doctors after she lost both her legs when a routine hospital operation went wrong has been awarded $62 million by a New York City jury.

Stacey Galette has received $58 million for her pain and suffering and extra $4 million in 'special damages' following a botched hospital operation

Stacey Galette, 30, claims she was supposed to be in and out of hospital in one day following straightforward gynaecological surgery.

But she was left a double amputee after bungling doctors allegedly left her with an infection that turned into gangrene and spread to both her feet.

Legal papers claim she was in a coma for three weeks at Winthorp University Hospital.

'When I woke up, I was in ICU and I asked my family what I was doing here,' she told NBC.

'They told me about my foot [which] got amputated.'

Mrs Galette, who has a ten-year-old daughter, said she had endured 'endless pain' as a result of the botched operation.

The trained medical technician claims her intestine was punctured during the original surgery two years ago, triggering an infection.

Mrs Galette had to be fitted with prosthetics and also suffered permanent partial hearing loss, she claimed.

She filed the lawsuit at Brooklyn 
Supreme Court against Winthorp University Hospital on Long Island and 
three doctors seeking unspecified damages in 2010.

On Friday it was confirmed she had been awarded $58 million for pain and suffering and another $4 million in special damages, NBC reported.

The result comes after a 12-week trial.

A hospital spokesman says Friday doctors diagnosed the complication quickly and treated it as best they could but her condition deteriorated quickly.

He says their efforts saved her life but left her disabled.

Galette said she was happy with the result.

'I’m just happy justice was served,' she told The New York Daily News.

'I’m not able to walk.'

'The jury did the right thing by rendering a verdict that will take care of this young lady for the rest of her life,' added Galette’s other lawyer, Ira Newman.

'If she could turn the clock back, she would do it in a heartbeat.'
