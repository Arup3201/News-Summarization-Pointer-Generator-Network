This is Yoga Man, and he's bringing his exercises to a train near you.

This unidentified fellow has performed yoga on Sydney's trains for at least the past three years, to the amusement of the city's commuters.

His true identity is unknown. No one is sure why he performs his Downward-facing Dogs on public transport, of all places.

But his enthusiasm for the ancient set of exercises, known its physical, mental and spiritual benefits, goes without saying.

Hello, there! This is Yoga Man, the fellow who is regularly spotted performing his exercises around Sydney. He is pictured here wiggling his feet in the air, much like a bug

Commuters have spotted Yoga Man performing his elaborate stretches on Sydney's northern train lines, including at North Sydney station.

In two YouTube videos, Yoga Man is even captured lying on his back, rapidly kicking his feet in the air like an insect trapped on its back. 

'You (gotta) get your workout in, I guess,' one video is captioned. 

Sometimes he performs handstands. Judo instructor Mark Brewer uploaded an image of him doing just that last week.

'So easy to get active - Everywhere and anywhere!' wrote Mr Brewer, a keen athlete. '#Yoga #fitness #inspiration'.

Yoga Man, who has a mop of shaggy grey hair, appears to be middle aged.

It's clear he is in top physical condition, given he can perform advanced back bends... and is rarely pictured wearing a T-Shirt.

As with most yoga practitioners, Yoga Man does not wear shoes when exercising. 

But he follows the proper etiquette, often laying out a yoga mat, or at the very least, a towel.

Whether or not it's appropriate to perform exercises such as this on public transport is another matter. 

'Now I've seen everything', another Instagram user exclaimed after spotting him shirtless three years ago.

Prominent Sydney yoga instructors could not immediately identify Yoga Man.

But Mary-Louise Parkinson, president of the International Yoga Teachers Association, told Daily Mail Australia she thought his efforts were fabulous. 

'I think it's fantastic, and it just demonstrates how mainstream yoga has become,' she said. 

Ms Parkinson, from the city's northern beaches, said that in her lifetime, yoga has transformed from an exercise introduced to help some young women at school to a popular practice.   

'Yoga is not just doing postures, it's bringing consciousness to everything you do, she said. 

'You can do it at any time of the day or night, even putting yourself to sleep by breathing properly.'

That's a creed Yoga Man would almost certainly agree with. A Sydney Trains spokeswoman was unavailable to comment.
