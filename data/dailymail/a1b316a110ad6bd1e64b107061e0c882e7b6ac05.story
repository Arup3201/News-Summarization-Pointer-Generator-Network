Tax cuts for millions of families could be implemented long before the deficit is eradicated, David Cameron said yesterday.

The Prime Minister said we could benefit from slashed taxes much sooner than 2018, when Britain is due to balance its books.

He said there was no reason for public finances to be back in the black before a Tory government starts to lift the tax burden on hard-working families.

It raises the prospect of the tax cuts coming in as early as 2016 – the first Budget after the General Election.

The PM has suggested that tax cuts could be delivered sooner rather than later, saying that with a clear plan ‘you don’t have to wait until Britain is back in the black before you make progress with these reductions'

It comes after he electrified the Tory conference on Wednesday with a dramatic pledge to raise the 40p income tax threshold from £41,900 to £50,000 by 2020. 

Thousands of extra workers, including teachers and police officers, have been dragged into the band in recent years.

Yesterday he said he had ‘no plans to raise VAT’ but did not rule out further savings from the defence budget after the next spending review in 2016.

He also promised to raise the personal allowance to £12,500 if his party wins a second term in office to give a £500-a-year boost to those on low incomes.

It had been thought that the changes would not come in until Chancellor George Osborne eliminates the deficit, which he says he is on course to do by 2018/19.

But, on a trip to Afghanistan yesterday, Mr Cameron suggested the threshold increases could start much sooner than had been expected.

Mr Cameron said that the current parliament had shown that the Government could make £100billion of cuts while also raising the income tax threshold at a cost of £9billion

It was thought that the tax cuts, which will cost £7.2billion a year, would be delivered towards the end of the next parliament, as another £25billion of cuts are needed to balance the books. 

But speaking about the issue for the first time since his conference speech, Mr Cameron said they could be delivered sooner rather than later.

The current parliament, he said, had shown that the Government could make £100billion of cuts while also raising the income tax threshold at a cost of £9billion.

He said: ‘I think we have shown in the last parliament that it’s perfectly possible – if you manage the nation’s finances wisely – to deliver tax reductions at the same time as making savings and efficiencies. 

In the last parliament we had to make something like £100billion of cuts but also actually made tax cuts in terms of the personal allowance.

‘So in a parliament when we have to make further spending reductions – but not as much as in this parliament – I think it’s perfectly possible to achieve the sort of tax reductions we have set out.

Attack: George Osborne yesterday

George Osborne yesterday warned that British politics had returned to a battle between the statist Left and the free market Right not seen since the days of the Berlin Wall.

He urged bosses to stick up for the market – and warned that many pressure groups, charities and trade unions would be quick to put the anti-business point of view.

He said in a speech to the Institute of Directors: ‘You have to get out there and put the business argument.’

‘Because there are plenty of pressure groups, plenty of trade unions and plenty of charities that will put the counter view. There is a big argument about our future, about whether we are a country that is for business, for enterprise, for the free market.

Mr Osborne added: ‘For the first time since my adult life, that is up for grabs. That issue felt it had been resolved when the Berlin Wall fell.

‘It doesn’t mean you have to endorse a party, a party like the Conservatives, but it does mean you have to get out there and put the business argument… that is the only way we are going to win this argument for an enterprise, low-tax economy which delivers prosperity for generations to come.’

TUC leader Frances O’Grady, said the Chancellor had ‘let down his guard to show how he agrees with Margaret Thatcher’s “enemy within” rhetoric’.

‘As long as you have got a clear plan and a clear pathway, you don’t have to wait until Britain is back in the black before you make progress with these reductions.’

Mr Cameron would not be drawn on which departments would face the greatest reductions in their budgets, although he has already promised to protect spending on the health service for the next five years.

‘In terms of defence and other budgets, we have made some commitments on defence and to the defence equipment programme but greater details will be set out at the next election,’ he said.

All Nato countries have pledged to spend 2 per cent of their GDP on defence, and Britain is currently meeting this target.

But analysis by senior military personnel leaked to the media this summer warned it would drop below this threshold in 2017.
