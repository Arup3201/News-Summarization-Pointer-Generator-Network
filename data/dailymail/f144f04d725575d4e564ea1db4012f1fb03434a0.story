Pippa the dog had a miracle escape after she plunged off a 100ft cliff and survived by landing in the sea below

A lucky black labrador survived a 100ft fall after she plunged off a cliff and landed in the sea below.

The pet dog called Pippa was being taken for a walk near Swanage, Dorset, when she suddenly became excited at seeing the sea in the distance.

She ran off from owners Daniel and Katy Pordage, dashed 500 yards across two fields towards the edge of the cliff without realising the danger.

Pippa landed in an area of water between two rocks 100ft below and suffered just an injured front paw in the fall.

Two climbers who were abseiling down to scale the cliff at Anvil Point plucked the dog out of the water and held on to her until a lifeboat crew arrived.

Pippa was taken aboard and ferried to the lifeboat station where she was reunited with her relieved owners.

Mrs Pordage,
 a 27-year-old veterinery nurse, looked at the three-year-old and 
thought she had broken her front right leg but a further examination 
revealed just a damaged tendon.

Her
 and her husband, a 32-year-old web designer from Hythe, near 
Southampton, were enjoying a break on the Isle of Purbeck with their 
dogs, Pippa and Marley.

They had been walking the two dogs off their leads when Pippa made a bolt for it.

Mr Pordage said: 'We were quite a way back from the cliffs, there were two fields and a path between us. Pippa just saw the blue sea and decided to wanted to go in the water and darted straight for it.

'I chased after her and called her to come back. I got to the edge of the cliff and couldn’t see her anywhere.

'I thought that she couldn’t have been stupid enough to go over the edge but she was. Then I heard a dog barking from below.'

Relieved: Dog Pippa with her owners Katie and Daniel Pordage

A coastguard team and lifeboat crew from Swanage arrived at the scene and the rescuers found Pippa sat on rocks with two climbers.

Mr Pordage said: 'She was extremely lucky because she fell into the water between two areas of rocks.

'Katy is a veterinary nurse of 10 years and had a look at Pippa and thought her leg was broken but the vets discovered it is just a damaged tendon that needed a bandage.

'Pippa doesn’t often deviate from us when we are walking her so it was a shock when she sprinted off.'

A spokesman for the Swanage lifeboat, said: 'Luckily, Pippa fell in the only bit of water on the beach below. The lifeboat located the dog sat on a rock with two climbers that happened to be in the area.

'The lifeboat then returned to Swanage where the dog was reunited with her very grateful owners. We would like to remind dog owners to please take care when walking dogs along the coast path.'
