A man has moved into what might be the world's smallest mobile home in a bid to save money and go 'off the grid'.

Rob Greenfield, from San Diego in California, has purchased a 'house' that measures just 50 sq foot and will live in the tiny box for the next year.

As well as saving on money and rent, the 28-year-old is keen to avoid to trappings of modern life such as the internet, driving or even a plumbed toilet.

The environmental activist is set to move into the tiny 5ft by 10ft house as soon as he can find a permanent pitch for it.

He has moved out of his $1600 (£1055) a month, three-bedroom apartment and taken up residence in his new home which cost him just $950 (£626).

He is looking for a place where he will be able to place solar panels, collect rainwater and build a compost pit in order to live in the mobile home long-term.

The environmental activist will offer food from his planned vegetable patch and provide handyman services in exchange for parking his home in people's gardens - and is even planning to offer tours of the tiny box.

He said: 'I want to live simply and cheaply and be as self-sufficient as possible.

The interior of the home will be kitted out with a basic stove, a bed and a place to read

'And I want to show other people that you can live a happy and fulfilled life by being Earth-friendly, not just by consuming the planet's resources.

'I'll be giving tours and inviting people in to see what it is like practically to have very few belongings.

'I have a desire to live simply, and having a tiny home forces you to do that.

'Most of my living will be done outside - I want to demonstrate the way the Earth provides for us.

'The inside will be kitted out with a basic rocket stove, a bed and a place to read.

'And I can't wait to settle me and my tiny home in a new permanent space.'

The environmental activist is even planning to offer tours of the tiny box once it is up and running as a home

Writing on his website, he added: 'The idea is that I want to be of service and benefit to the person who gives a place for my tiny home.

'I want to make your life more enjoyable if you can host my tiny home.

'Besides growing my own food I'll be harvesting food from the neighbourhood and will get you lots of fresh fruit!

'I am going to be living 100% off the grid so I will not need to use your home at all.

'I won't even use the toilet, garbage can, or the internet so you can see as little or as much of me as you'd like really.

'I also don't have a car, just my bike so I won't take up parking.'
