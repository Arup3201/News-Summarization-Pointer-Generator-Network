Millions of people worldwide are engaging in high-risk tech.

Now a ‘USB condom’ has been designed by security experts in an effort to keep sensitive data secure.

The device allows users to plug their phones or tablets into unfamiliar USB ports without risking being infected with a virus.

The gadget is described by Crowd Supply, who sells the product, as ‘a protective barrier between your device and "juice-jacking" hackers.’

USB cables are made up of different cables, wrapped in a single protective casing. 

Each has a different function, with two serving to provide electricity while another transfer data

The USB condom is a small chip that has both male and female ports.

These connect between a device and the unknown USB port, effectively severing any data connection but linking up the power cables. 

It was created by New York-based security experts int3.cc in an effort to combat the growing risk of fake public charging stations that can download private data.

The gadget initially started out as an experiment, and the company said they ‘didn’t think much more about it’ and were surprised by its popularity. 

The USB condom is now being sold by online information security group Xipiter for $10 (£6) each.
