The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority is facing a bit of embarrassment after a new license plate affixed to some of its fleet vehicles was spotted with a typo. 

The plates read 'Metropolitan Transporation Authority', with the second 't' in 'transportation' mysteriously missing.

The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles says the fault doesn't lie with the MTA and is trying to figure out whether the error occurred in the designing or manufacturing stage.

A license plate with the spelling error appears on an MTA fleet vehicle in New York. It's unclear how many license plates with the typo were printed

The New York State DMV says it ordered 908 license plates in the batch but doesn't know how many carry the mistake or how much it will cost to replace them

Some are speculating that the problem happened because the full word 'transportation' didn't fit in the allotted space on the plate, according to Pix 11. 

The DMV says it ordered 908 plates and plans to replace the error-ridden ones. 

Officials couldn't, however, provide the exact number of replacements needed or the cost of reprinting.

The faux pas follows a few months after Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism committed its own spelling transgression on some of its graduates' diplomas. 

The school spelled 'integrated' without the 'n' for students obtaining a degree from its Integrated Marketing Communications program.
