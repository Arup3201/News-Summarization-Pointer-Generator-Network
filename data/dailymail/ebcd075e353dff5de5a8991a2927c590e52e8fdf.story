An Egyptian police chief was shot dead today as security forces tried to regain control of an area where gunmen killed 11 policemen last month and mutilated their bodies.

Police had earlier fired tear gas and exchanged gunfire with armed men in Kerdasa, on the outskirts of Cairo, state TV reported.

Despite wearing a bulletproof vest, Giza Police Chief General Nabil Farag was killed after unidentified militants opened fire. He was shot dead, and as these dramatic photographs show, had to be carried away by his fellow officers.

Police Chief General Farag had been on an operation with security forces deployed early morning to the town of Kirdasa to drive off suspected Islamists taking control of the town near Giza Pyramids, Egypt

Security troops backed up by helicopters, had stormed into the area, an Islamist stronghold, to carry out arrests after the torching of a number of police stations and the killing of an estimated 11 officers in clashes that followed the removal of President Mohamed Morsi in July.

Kerdasa police station was abandoned after it was hit with rocket propelled grenades and gunfire on August 14 - the same day security forces moved against protests by supporters of the deposed president, killing hundreds.

Police forces had not been allowed in Kerdasa since then.

General Nabil Farrag died shortly after being brought to a hospital. Security forces captured 14 Islamist fugitives wanted for alleged involvement in violence in the village and at the six-week long Islamist sit-in outside Cairo University in support of ousted president Mohammed Morsi

The Egyptian Interior Ministry said the police chief was shot by gunmen positioned on the roofs of schools and mosques which the militants had taken over.

At least one other police officer was injured in Thursday's violence, state TV reported.

It said police forces took control of the area and imposed a curfew.

As police and rebels fired at each other, Egyptian explosives experts were working to defuse bombs found on the public metro.

Specialists defused two primitive bombs which has been planted 100 metres from Helmeyet el-Zaytoun station in northeast Cairo.

Egypt has suffered outbreaks of violence and attacks on police and civilians following Morsi's exit.

Violence between his supporters and security forces included massive attacks on police stations, security officers and churches.

At least 1,000 people have died in the violence with most deaths coming during the security forces' dispersal of two pro-Morsi sit-ins in Cairo on August 14. About 100 police officers also died in the clashes.

Nearly 2,000 Islamist activists and politicians have been arrested since Morsi's removal.

Kerdasa, known for producing and selling luxury fabrics is 14 km from Cairo and known to be an Islamist stronghold.

Residents of the area said yesterday they were not in control of the area but do not want police there.

'We don't trust them as we know they will come to arrest people we know and respect whom they blame on the violence that we know was done by outsiders, not by our respectable sheikhs,' Ahmed Aly, a resident, told Reuters on Wednesday.

Egyptian security forces had on Monday stormed the town of Delga in Minya province, about 300 km south of Cairo, clearing barricades that was set by Morsi's supporters there who were almost in control of the town. Forces arrested 56 residents.
