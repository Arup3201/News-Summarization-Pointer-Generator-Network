While men are traditionally seen to be the more gadget-savvy sex, it is actually women who own the most tablet devices, according to the latest research.

A new study found that women now own over half of all the tablets in the UK.

Last year women owned 43 per cent of UK tablet devices, now tech-loving women own 52 per cent.

This change is seemingly driven by women snapping up older devices such as iPads 1 and 2 (60 per cent are owned by women), and also the newer iPad Mini model (58 per cent of owners are female).

John Gilbert, Lead Director at YouGov Technology and Telecoms, told The Telegraph: 'The early adopters of tablets have typically been affluent males.

'As they buy the latest models, they have placed their old devices on to the secondary market or give them to other members of their household.

'A growing number of females and under-35s own older tablets, such as the iPad 1 and 2 while affluent males have the more recent iPad 3 and 4 and Samsung devices.'

The research also looked at the ages of UK tablet owners and found that the highest growth is being driven by 18-34 year olds.

The more even distribution of tablet ownership across age groups is an indication of the UK market becoming more mainstream, says YouGov.

The study also found that 22 per cent of the adult population owns a tablet, which is up 18 per cent.
