Wigan have locked up the futures of head coach Shaun Wane and captain Sean O'Loughlin on three-year deals.

News of the deals comes on the eve of Wigan's Super League Grand Final showdown against St Helens at Old Trafford on Saturday.

Warriors chairman Ian Lenagan said: 'The contract extensions of Shaun and Sean are very important to the Wigan Club. It is very symbolic that we have jointly announced these deals as it is very evident that they work very well together.

'There is a lot of trust between them and we couldn't have two more committed people in the key positions of head coach and captain of Wigan.'

 Wane, who made more than 150 appearances for his hometown club between 1981 and 1990, has been head coach since 2012 and won the League Leader's Shield in his first season before a Grand Final and Challenge Cup double last year.

His new contract includes a clause which will see it roll on after the initial three-year period expires.

O'Loughlin's association with the club is almost as long, and longer if you consider both his father Keiron and uncle Kevin played for the Warriors. The England captain has made 342 appearances for Wigan since his debut in 2002.

'Shaun Wane has earned his extension on the back of the 2013 Super League and Challenge Cup double and now leading his team to the 2014 Grand Final,' Lenagan added.

'Anyone who saw the recent World Club Challenge documentary will see the passion that he carries into his role and will understand why we have extended his contract for a minimum of three years and rolling thereafter.

'In Sean O'Loughlin, we are lucky to have one of the world's most respected rugby league players. He is still producing high level performances and we are confident that he can continue this in the coming years.

'The recent announcement of him becoming England captain is a reward for having a career of consistency and quality. He is a fine role model and we are proud that he leads us.'

Wigan are strong favourites for Saturday's contest at Old Trafford against a Saints side who have lost in their last five appearances on the ground

Wane, a Manchester United fan who is eager to add to his success at Old Trafford, said he was happy to commit himself to a club with the same ambitions as his own.

'I am really pleased to sign an extension to my present contract with my hometown club,' he said. 'I am very happy here, working with a group of people whose desire to win and improve completely matches mine.

'There is still a lot I want to achieve at Wigan and I will always be totally committed to achieving those goals. I would like to thank everyone involved at the club; the players, all the staff and in particular Ian Lenagan for their continued support.'

O'Loughlin, 31, revealed he has agreed to move into coaching with Wigan at the end of his playing career. 

'I am delighted to have extended my stay with Wigan,' he said. 'The club has been my life. I have been through some tough times but it has all been worth it to experience the great times that the club is now enjoying.

'I love working with this group of players and coaching staff and I am confident that the club will continue to grow and improve. I still have a lot of personal ambition and I am as hungry as ever to win more trophies with this great club, before moving on to my agreed coaching position at Wigan.'
