Back in the time when Istanbul was known as Constantinople, it was chariot racing that divided the city.

There were four teams - the Blues, the Greens, the Reds and the Whites - and one hundred thousand enraptured spectators, from commoners to the Emperor himself, would assemble at the giant Hippodrome to witness the thunderous clatter of hooves through the blood red dust.

But loyalties ran far deeper than raceday. It was a way of life. One did not simply swap allegiances. Each of the teams represented a particular social group, religious denomination or political faction and each inspired and demanded loyalty.

The sport may have changed quite drastically but Istanbul remains a city split into loyal factions. It is a European outpost where football is the way of life and rouses great passions.

Like the fans of the chariot teams in Byzantine times, the followers of Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas - to take the city and the whole country's three most successful teams - will always go that extra mile to try and outdo one another.

And like those teams of equine chargers, fortunes are always fluctuating. Right now, it is Besiktas, who take on Tottenham Hotspur at the Ataturk Stadium in the UEFA Europa League, who are in the ascendancy.

Besiktas currently top the Turkish Super Lig. They have lost just two of their 12 league matches so far and in both were handicapped by having a man sent off.

The Europa League has brought further gains for their manager Slaven Bilic, formerly of West Ham and Everton during his playing days. Like Spurs, they remain unbeaten in Group C and know one last win will take them through as winners.

And so those passionate fans will take it as their duty to create one of those formidable and fearsome Turkish atmospheres that have cowed so many visitors in the past.

It's a given we will see the booming drums and exploding pyrotechnics within the cavernous 76,000-seater Ataturk - the venue where Liverpool so miraculously won the Champions League in 2005 - on Thursday night.

Besiktas don't seem to have been affected by being in a state of flux this season. They left their crumbling Inonu Stadium, on the banks of the Bosphorus and close to the Dolmabahce Palace and Taksim Square, last year to take up temporary residence at the big Olympic arena out of the city centre.

By the end of the campaign, their new home, the Vodafone Arena, is due to be completed - with 9,000 more fans to be accommodated.

Spurs would already have sewn up the group if not for Demba Ba's last-gasp penalty at White Hart Lane. The former West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea hotshot has been scoring everywhere for Besiktas and has 16 goals in 18 matches since leaving Stamford Bridge.

Luckily for Mauricio Pochettino and his all-too-often shaky defence, Ba is likely to be ruled out of the match with an injured toe.

Not that Spurs are at all fazed by such hostile places. They are unbeaten in 18 Europa League group stage matches, surviving and thriving in such cauldrons as Lazio, Panathinaikos and Partizan Belgrade in the recent past.

The Europa League has certainly served as a springboard for Harry Kane. His seven goals in the competition seem to have finally convinced Pochettino to install him as the club's No 1 striker in the Premier League as well and the England Under 21 man should prosper.

He is the group phase's second top scorer, behind Alan of Red Bull Salzburg and so has personal glory to chase in Turkey's largest city.

For both these sides, there are incentives to finish on top of the group. In the last 32 draw the 12 group winners are combined with the four teams with the best records dropping down from the Champions League. Inter Milan and Fiorentina are just two of the teams they would avoid.

And, for the first time, the winners of the Europa League will gain entry into next season's Champions League. A particularly important prize for Spurs, given their disappointing Premier League form.

So, in this bustling, historic metropolis of 14 million people at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, there is, as there has always been throughout time, everything to play for.
