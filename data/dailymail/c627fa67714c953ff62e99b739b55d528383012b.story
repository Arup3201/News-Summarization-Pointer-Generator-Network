A firefighter who found a newborn baby who had been abandoned by her mother in a cemetery in 1995 has surprised the girl at her high school graduation.

Skyler James was shocked when Charlie Heflin approached her on her final day at Charleston High School in Illinois and repeated the story of how they had met 18 years ago.

'I was totally shocked,' she told WFIE. 'It's something that I've dreamed of since I was a little kid, and it's amazing.'

Reunion: Skyler James was surprised by firefighter Charlie Heflin at her graduation 18 years after he found her abandoned in a cemetery. Her adoptive parents, right, tracked him down last month

Emotional: There were tears and hugs as Skyler met the man who'd saved her from freezing temperatures

She still 
had her umbilical cord attached and was covered in blood when she was 
dumped in a cemetery in Champaign, Illinois in November 1995.

Local authorities received an anonymous call from a woman around 7am, telling them that a baby had been left beneath a pine tree at Mount Hope Cemetery.

But when police and firefighters went to the area to find her, they discovered nothing.

Local firefighter Heflin happened to be listening to scanner traffic and, on a hunch, went to look at a different cemetery.

Found: She was only a few hours old and covered with blood and leaves when he found her in 1995

Scene: Authorities had received a call saying that a baby had been left in a cemetery - but they couldn't find her. Heflin decided to go to a different cemetery and found her beneath a pine tree

Again, he 
found nothing - but as he walked back to his truck, he turned around 
again and heard a small whimper. At the base of a pine tree, he found 
the tiny baby.

The little girl was covered in blood and leaves as she fought to live in the freezing temperatures.

'I handed her off to the paramedics and I didn't see her since,' Heflin, from Gibson County, said.

She was adopted five days later by Bonnie and Greg James. They had the name of the hero firefighter so when Skyler was a young girl, they tried to look for him - but found nothing.

But just three weeks before her high school graduation, they found him on Facebook and learned he worked at the Patoka Fire Station.

Gifts: He gave her the sweater he wore on the night that he found her, along with newspaper cuttings

Joy: Skyler said that she had been dreaming about the reunion for years and was overjoyed to meet him

'The call was, "Are you Charlie Heflin? Do you remember rescuing a baby back in 1995?"' he said. 'My heart just sank.'

Then without telling their daughter, they invited him to the graduation for an emotional reunion.

He also gave Sklyer newspaper cuttings from when she was saved, as well as the jacket he had been wearing that morning. Images show them hugging and grinning as they meet for the first time.

Skyler is now planning to attend Concordia University in Chicago.
