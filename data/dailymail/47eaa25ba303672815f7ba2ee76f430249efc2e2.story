A school founded by tennis star Andre Agassi has been accused of racism by one of the teachers.

James Holmes Jr has taken legal action against the Las Vegas based Andre Agassi Academy claiming he was fired because he was black.

The biology teacher claims he was singled out because of his colour and suffered prejudicial treatment.

A teacher at a school founded by tennis legend Andre Agassi, seen here with wife Steffi Graf earlier this week, claims he was the victim of racism

According to his lawsuit Holmes said 
his problems began in 2008 three years after joining the school to teach
9th and 10th grade students biology.

He said the new principal favored white teachers and he found his role increasingly marginalized.

Holmes
says in legal papers that he was refused permission to travel to a 
science conference while other white teachers were allowed to attend.

James also claimed the principal denied his request for new lab materials due to budget restraints but he later found out the lab materials were ordered for two white teachers instead.

According to the suit, James said he filed a complaint with the school but was sacked and replaced by an elementary school teacher who was not certified to take science classes.

Agassi founded the tuition free school in 2001 in Las Vegas to help at risk children and boasts a high graduation rate

He is demanding at least $75,000, according to TMZ.com

Former Wimbledon champion Agassi, 41, opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in 2001.

The school, which is tuition free, recruits at risk children in the Las Vegas area.

It has one of the best graduation rates among schools in the Vegas area.

The school has been such a success that Agassi, who is married to Steffi Graff, is considering opening other academies across the US.

A spokesman for the Las Vegas Academy said they will contest the lawsuit by Holmes.

A spokesman said: 'We will aggressively defend the suit because the case is baseless and without any merit.'
