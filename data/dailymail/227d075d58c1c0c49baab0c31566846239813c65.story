Real Madrid are the most clinically efficient scorers across the 'Big Five' divisions of Europe so far this season, according to new figures showing they have managed one goal for every 5.4 attempts in La Liga. 

No other top-flight side among the 98 clubs from the Premier League, La Liga, Germany's Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A or France's Ligue 1 takes as few attempts to score each goal.

Real Madrid are inspired by the stunning efficiency of Cristiano Ronaldo, who has already scored an astonishing 28 league goals in 18 games this season. His team-mate Gareth Bale has added another 10 league goals in 16 starts.

The numbers have been published by the Football Observatory in Switzerland. The four most clinical teams are all Spanish, with Valencia in second place (5.7 attempts per goal), followed by Atletico Madrid (6) and Barcelona (6.6).

The most clinical English team are Chelsea, with one goal per seven attempts. They are in joint 10th place of the 98 clubs. Also above them are Lyon of France and Sevilla of Spain (both 6.7 attempts per goal), and a trio of German clubs: Eintracht Frankfurt, Hertha Berlin and Schalke (all 6.9 attempts per goal).

Diego Costa has been the driving force in helping Chelsea's surge to the top of the efficiency rankings as well as the top of the table with 17 goals in 19 Premier League appearances. Eden Hazard with eight goals in 22 league games is their next highest scorer.

As Chelsea prepare to face Liverpool tonight in the second leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final, it is notable that Liverpool are down in 66th place of the 98 clubs, taking 11.1 attempts per goal this season.

Despite only scoring five league goals in 20 games, Steven Gerrard is Liverpool's top scorer this season 

Club, country, (average shots per goal) 

1. Real Madrid, Spain, (5.4) 

2. Valencia, Spain, (5.7) 

3. Atletico Madrid, Spain, (6.0) 

4. Barcelona, Spain, (6.6)

5=. Lyon, France (6.7)

5=. Sevilla, Spain, (6.7) 

7=. Frankfurt, Germany, (6.9)

7=. Hertha Berlin, Germany, 6.9) 

7=. Schalke, Germany, (6.7) 

10=. Chelsea, England, (7.0)

10=. Paris Saint German, France, (7.0)  

Steven Gerrard is their leading league scorer with five goals in 20 appearances and nine in all competitions. Raheem Sterling is next with four league goals and three League Cup goals to make seven in total but no other Liverpool player has scored more than four goals in all competitions combined.

Chelsea, whose league efficiency at converting attempts is more than twice as good as Liverpool's, have six players with five or more goals each this season in all competitions, with Oscar, Didier Drogba, Andre Schurrle and defender John Terry in addition to Costa and Hazard.

The next most efficient English teams in the league after Chelsea are Southampton and Manchester United, in joint 15th place in Europe on 7.6 attempts per goal. West Ham and Manchester City are joint 29th, on 8.5 attempts per goal then Arsenal in joint 39th place on nine attempts per goal.

Chelsea have shared the goals this season and defender John Terry has managed seven from 27 games

Tottenham (9.3), Everton (9.5) and Crystal Palace (9.8) are the only other English clubs in the top 50.

At the other end of the chart, only one club of the 98 included are worse at converting attempts than Aston Villa, who are in 97th place with on 20.9 shots per goal. That is Hamburg of the Bundesliga, on 22.9.

Aston Villa are particularly woeful at taking chances in the second half of games. As the researchers from the Observatory said: 'These figures both reflect a lack of efficiency and the difficulty in taking up a favourable position to shoot. For example, Villa have scored only two goals out of 109 attempts in second halves.'
