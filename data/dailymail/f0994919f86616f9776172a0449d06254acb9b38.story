Erik Lamela finally looks like flourishing under new manager and fellow Argentine Mauricio Pochettino after a nightmare first year at Tottenham.

Following his club-record Â£30million transfer from Roma last summer, the winger scored only once in 17 games.

But Pochettino has earmarked Lamela as an integral part of his Spurs plans.

'We expect a lot from him, he's an unbelievable player,' he said. 'He needs to show us that he deserves to play but at the moment we are happy with his performance.'

Lamela scored twice in a 3-2 friendly win against Toronto on Wednesday night.

'I would like to carry this form into the season but I have to continue to work hard,' said Lamela. 'As the season progresses I will get better.'
