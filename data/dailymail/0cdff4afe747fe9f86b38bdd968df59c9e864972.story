With Father's Day just around the corner, the likes of Richard Branson, Chelsea Clinton and Ziauddin Yousafzai have made touching films about how fathers can empower their daughters.

The videos are in aid of G(irls)20 - a global initiative to celebrate the powerful force fathers can play in the advancement of their daughters.

The campaign calls on fathers from around the world to showcase the ways in which they empower their daughters to succeed and achieve - whatever age, whatever dream - and also encourages daughters to share stories about how their fathers have empowered them.

Daddy dearest: The likes of Richard and daughter Holly Branson have made short films about the relationship between father and daughter to celebrate the powerful force fathers can play in the advancement of their daughters

The initiative, which is being supported by hotel group Carlson Rezidor, is being launched in the run-up to the world leaders' meeting at the G20 in Australia this August. There, G(irls)20 will convene 24 girls from around the world to address how to economically engage and empower girls and women to achieve growth goals globally and in their home countries.

On how fathers empower their daughters, Virgin boss Richard Branson, father to 32-year-old Holly Branson, said: 'Give them the freedom to do what they want to do with their life. It is so sad that in some places in the world, daughters are treated as second-class citizens and thatâ€™s got to be put right.

'People cannot use religion as an excuse, which is certainly not what the people who originally set out their religions would have wanted, so just treat all your children equally.'

Holly adds: 'I completely agree. If every father can 
empower their daughter to do exactly what they want and what their 
passion is, that's exactly what I did. It meant that I had the drive to 
get my GCSEs, the right A-levels and make it to become a doctor.'

Chelsea Clinton, the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said: 'It is impossible for me to describe the extent to which my father has supported me, nurtured me and empowered me over the years.

'He has always taught me 
the importance of doing right - by our family, by the communities I've 
chosen to be apart of and ultimately by the world.

'Ultimately, trying
 to do what's good, engaging in a life of service, is ultimately what's 
going to give my life the most fulfillment and ensure that I'm living up
 to be the daughter that he always wanted and the daughter that I always
 wanted to be for him and also for myself.

'He's always taught me the 
importance of family. He made every effort to be home for dinner every 
night, unless he was on another continent. He's always challenged me to 
take risks, the ones that are necessary for the person that I want to 
be.'

Support: Chelsea Clinton also stars in the short film and discusses how her father has supported her in every decision she has made and set good examples for her

Nurturing: Chelsea Clinton, the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said it's impossible to explain how much her father has empowered her

Family: Chelsea, pictured with her parents in 1992, says that Bill always made sure he was home for dinner

Chelsea, 34, goes on to explain that whether it was taking an extra 
hard maths class and ensuring that he was there to help her navigate her 
homework or in deciding that she would marry partner Mark and join the Clinton 
foundation, Bill supported her decisions, small and large.

She added: 'I am grateful to my father most of all for always being 
ready with a hug, a word of advice but most of all with an example as 
Mark and I think about starting our own family. So, happy father's day, dad,
 and to fathers everywhere.'

There is also a video message from Ziauddin Yousafzai, father of Malala Yousafzai, the young woman who shot to international acclaim when she courageously protested against the Taliban for the education rights of children, especially for Pakistani girls.

He said: 'My answer is very simple, it's time-tested: I empower my daughter through education.

The power of education: Ziauddin Yousafzai, father of Malala Yousafzai, the young woman who protested against the Taliban for the education rights of children, says it's vital to teach your children the power of education

'Education
 empowers every individual whether a man or a woman and if some 
parents think they will become weaker and they will lose strength if 
they empower their daughters, I want to tell them from my experience that
 if you empower your daughter, you will be stronger.

'Your daughter and 
son are your strength. Your life will become more comfortable, you will 
feel more free if you have educated children.

'Education is power, it's like a light in complete darkness.'
