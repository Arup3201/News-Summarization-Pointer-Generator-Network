President Barack Obama and his family have six pies on offer as part of their Thanksgiving meal at the White House. 

They can pick from banana cream, coconut cream, pumpkin, apple, pecan and cherry.

But before dessert they need to contend with all the holiday's basics on their menu.

They are having thyme-roasted turkey and honey-baked ham, cornbread stuffing and oyster stuffing, braised winter greens and macaroni and cheese. 

Don't forget the green bean casserole, sweet potato gratin, mashed potatoes and dinner rolls.

And despite the lavish spread, the president himself will be picking up the bill.

Gary Walters, who was chief White House usher for many years, said the payment rule dates back to 1800 when the White House was first occupied by President John Adams and there was no staff. 

Presidents brought staff with them and paid for everything.

Congress gradually began spending money to maintain an official White House staff to oversee operations and maintenance, but presidents continued to pay for personal expenses.

What it boils down to, Walters said, is that the White House is first and foremost the president's home.

The president said in his weekly radio and Internet address that the first family planned to spend the day with friends and family - catching up, eating good food and watching some football.

He says Thanksgiving is his favorite holiday 'because, more than any other, it is uniquely American.'

Obama also called U.S. troops to thank them for their service - a tradition he often upholds on Thanksgiving.   

On Wednesday Obama and his family handed out canned and fresh vegetables and bread to clients of Bread for the City, a center in southeast Washington that provides food, clothing and other services to the poor. 

They were joined by Michelle Obama's mother Marion Robinson.

In time-honored tradition he also pardoned the National Thanksgiving Turkey.

Obama hands out Thanksgiving food to the needy on Wednesday as part of his annual tradition

In the spirit of the holiday, Obama on Wednesday took 'action fully within my legal authority, the same kind of action taken by Democrats and Republican presidents before me,' to pardon the National Thanksgiving Turkey, a 49-pound bird named Cheese. 

He also spared an alternate turkey, a 47-pounder named Mac. Both came from Cooper Farms in Oakwood, Ohio.

'If you're a turkey, and you're named after a side dish, your chances of escaping Thanksgiving dinner are pretty low,' Obama said at the annual event, which drew international media coverage. He was accompanied by his daughters, Malia and Sasha, who declined his invitation to pet the birds. 'No,' Malia said.

The ceremony was moved indoors because of cold, wet weather that blanketed Washington.

'So these guys are well ahead of the curve. They really beat the odds,' he said of Mac and Cheese. 

The president obviously enjoys the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon, but his daughters looked like they would rather be anywhere else this week
