The original Mini has been named Britain’s favourite car of all-time - 55 years after its launch.

The McLaren F1 supercar was second in a survey by motoring magazine Autocar, with the Jaguar E-type in third place and the Range Rover fourth.

The Ford Escort Mexico was placed tenth.

The Mini, which has been dubbed Britain's favourite car, became an instant sensation 55 years ago

It was dubbed the 'classless car' when it launched in 1959 because it was as popular with celebrities as with mums

The Mini, designed by Sir Alec Issigonis became an instant sensation when launched in 1959 and went on to become a symbol of the ‘Swinging Sixties’.

It was dubbed the first ‘classless car’ because it was as popular with stars such as Peter Sellers and Twiggy as with students and mums out shopping.

More than 5.3million were sold over more than forty years.

Autocar editor Chas Hallett said: ‘It comes as little surprise that the original Mini has topped the list of all-time British greats.

Second: The McLaren F1 is favoured by top-level drivers - but the rest of Britons would prefer an old Mini

Third: The Jaguar E-type was made between 1961 and 1975, and regularly tops 'most beautiful car' lists

Sloane ranger: The British four-wheel drive SUV came fourth. It launched in 1970 and is still a mark of luxury

Eco-friendly: The two-seat, electric Yamaha Motiv.E, came fifth. It has been popular in Europe, not in the US

‘It represents a lot more than the British car industry; the Mini is associated with Great Britain around the world and, in many ways, it was ahead of its time.’

The Mini marque was revived in a larger and more-powerful version by new owners BMW in 2003 though the current incarnation built in Oxford is two and a half feet longer, seven inches wider and two inches taller than the original.

Mr Hallett added: ‘The original Mini is the best British car ever built according to the survey of our readers.

'Everyone loved and still loves an original Mini.

‘It ensured a fabulous drive every time, with a wheel literally at each corner and a low centre of gravity, plus it was cheap to own and run.

‘Many a former owner will undoubtedly be wishing they had held on to theirs, as good examples are now worth tens of thousands of pounds.’

Norfolk based Lotus was the most popular manufacturer as seven of its models made the 100 best British cars list.

Hybrid: The McLaren P1, which came sixth, is a limited production plug-in hybrid car, launched in 2012

Supercar: The Jaguar XJ220, which came seventh, held the record for fastest production car in 1992

Eighth: The Aston Martin DB5, which rose to fame at the hands of James Bond, took eighth place in the list

Ninth: The TVR Griffith is a lightweight fibreglass-bodied car, produced between 1991 and 2002

Tenth: The Ford Escort Mexico was inspired by the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally

Jaguar and Ford both had six cars in the top 100, including the Jaguar D-type and the Ford Sierra RS Cosworth, while Aston Martin had five, including the DB5 - a favourite with 007 James Bond.

The ‘Lotus seven’ models that made the top rank are the Elise, Esprit, Elan, Cortina, Evora, Carlton and Sunbeam.

Mr Hallett said: ‘It’s no surprise that a manufacturer that is held in such high regard tops the list of manufacturers. Over the years, Lotus has produced some wonderful examples of British engineering, so it is a worthy winner of such a prized accolade.’
