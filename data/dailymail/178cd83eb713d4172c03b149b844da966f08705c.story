Two of London's top hotels are among a raft of well-to-do establishments which have been warned to improve their food hygiene by a government watchdog.

The Food Standards Agency has given the four-star Radisson Blu Edwardian in Covent Garden and the Royal Lancaster hotel near Hyde Park just two stars in its food hygiene ratings. 

More than 550 hotels in the UK received two stars or less from the Food Standards Agency, in a study conducted by Which?

A spokesperson for The Caledonian Waldorf Astoria in Edinburgh said they have made significant investment to address the low FSA rating it received in its inspection, and that they are looking forward to their next one to improve their rating

At the inspection, the officer will check:

* how hygienically the food is handled – how it is prepared, cooked, re-heated, cooled and stored

* the condition of the structure of the buildings – the cleanliness, layout, lighting, ventilation and other facilities

* how the business manages what it does to make sure food is safe and so that the officer can be confident standards will be maintained in the future

The hygiene standards found at the time of inspection are then rated on a scale. 

At the bottom of the scale is '0' – this means urgent improvement is required. At the top of the scale is '5' – this means the hygiene standards are very good.

A two-star rating means the FSA demands 'improvement necessary', while a rating of one requires 'major improvement'.

A spokesperson for the FSA said: 'You can't tell a restaurant's hygiene standards by its staff, décor, or by how good the menu looks. It's the things you can't see that you need to consider. 

'The food hygiene rating gives you a glimpse into the kitchen and this is why we always ask people to check the hygiene rating before eating out either online or by looking for the green and black sticker and if you can't see one just ask.' 

At the four-star Royal Lancaster hotel near Hyde Park rooms cost from £223 a night, while the Radisson Blu Edwardian charges £305 a night. 

Other hotels in and around London that were given a rating of just one or two stars by the FSA included Euston's Thistle Hotel, the Premier Inn in Edgware and Dartford, a Travelodge in Borehamwood and The Britannia in Hampstead.

When you pay £290 a night for a five-star experience, at the Caledonian Waldorf Astoria in Edinburgh, you might expect a luxurious experience. 

However, the hotel received the lowest food-hygiene ratings, in its last inspection, with the nearby The Scotsman failing to impress as well, despite charging £175 a night. 

A Caledonian spokesperson said: 'Our new culinary team has implemented stringent measures to ensure this situation does not recur. We welcome the Environmental Health Officer's reinspection at their earliest convenience.'

Currently it is compulsory in Wales, and soon in Northern Ireland, that all establishments serving food must display their food-hygiene ratings.

Which? Travel is now calling for this to be implemented across England and Scotland.  

The FSA estimates that there are 500,000 cases of food poisoning every year, and campaigns to make food hygiene a priority for public health. 

It is currently leading a campaign to bring together the whole food chain to tackle campylobacter, one of the most common causes of food poisoning in the UK, with more than 72,000 confirmed cases last year, most of whom survived, but not all.

Other culprits include Clostridium perfringens, Norovirus and Salmonella, which hospitalises around 2,500 per year.

Which? Travel editor Jill Starley-Grainger told the Evening Standard: 'It's shocking that any hotel would put their guests' health at risk so we want the display of food hygiene ratings made compulsory as soon as possible.'

Out of surveyed individuals in December 2014, a quarter were not aware of food-hygiene ratings, and a further quarter never check them.  

The hotels named in the report said that processes had been changed since the inspections.

A Hilton Worldwide spokesperson said: 'All Hilton Worldwide hotels in the United Kingdom are required to comply with UK and European Union food safety laws. In this particular instance, each hotel acted immediately to address the Environmental Health Officers' concerns. The DoubleTree by Hilton Edinburgh City Centre was recently awarded a pass by the Food Standards Agency.'
