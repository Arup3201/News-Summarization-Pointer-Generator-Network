A press conference with the FA’s director of elite development Dan Ashworth at St George’s Park on Wednesday will mark a considerable power shift in control of the England football team.

Ashworth, already anointed by chairman Greg Dyke as the new technical director, will be giving a presentation of the ‘England DNA’ that will act as the blueprint for the playing style and preparation of international teams and, hopefully, eventually lead to tournament success.

The fact Ashworth is going public with his plans, formulated with his growing army of technical specialists handpicked since he arrived from West Brom in September 2012, shows he has the full backing of the FA hierarchy to take the helm in plotting England football’s future.

The FA board, who had the first viewing of Ashworth’s masterplan, want to give his department their head, knowing a proper long-term strategy is in place rather than the previous haphazard regime under Sir Trevor Brooking.

The repercussions will see the Wembley-based Club England set-up having to fit in with Ashworth’s agenda run from St George’s Park, where the next England manager is more likely to have his main office within Ashworth’s technical area.

The FA promised a sponsor for their flagship FA Cup would be in place by the third round of the tournament. But the draw takes place on Monday with no sign of a backer to replace £9million-a-year Budweiser. For the FA’s hapless commercial department, who brought in an expensive recruit from Manchester United for this search, it is a fiasco on a par with the England team exiting the World Cup after two group matches. A spokesman said they ‘remain confident’ of finding that elusive sponsor.

At least the FA can’t be faulted for their scrupulous recognition of almost every military encounter in history. There are no fewer than three major set-pieces starting this weekend marking the centenary of the Christmas truce football match with Germany in no-man’s land, as well as twin team photos.

ITV Sport would be keen to have Roy Keane back on their roster of pundits following his departure from Aston Villa. But they will allow the Irishman to concentrate on his role as assistant manager with the Republic before asking him back. Meanwhile, Keane’s autobiography remains high in the best-seller charts, while Kevin Pietersen’s book, launched in the same week in October, is unlikely to remain in the top 10 next week.

The Football Supporters Federation sports awards has belied its low-key status by attracting world-class superstars Luis Suarez and Sergio Aguero to pick up the main trophy in person over the last two years. Monday night’s bash at the Renaissance Hotel, St Pancras, also had Tony McCoy and darts world champion Michael Van Gerwen presenting gongs. The event’s big-spending sponsors William Hill are prepared to splash the cash for personal appearances.

Rugby shun baa-baas

It is no surprise that England Rugby 2015, who are heavily populated with staff from London 2012, have gone for choreographer Kim Gavin and Sara Donaldson’s event team Unspun Creative, who both worked on the Olympic ceremonies, to deliver the curtain raiser for the Rugby World Cup next September.

However, the 25-minute show on the Twickenham pitch will not feature any of the live animals from Danny Boyle’s Olympic launch, with speculation still around on Wednesday as to whether all the sheep survived the event.

lt sums up the grandstanding by some MPs over the World Cup corruption inquiry that Tory MP Damian Collins fancifully called for the Serious Fraud Office to get involved — even though it has no jurisdiction to do so. Solicitor General Robert Buckland responded for the Government by saying rugby is his ‘first love’.

Mario Balotelli posted his anti-Semitic Instagram picture despite having attended a session with social media specialists, laid on for all Liverpool staff, that explained the hazards facing public figures.
