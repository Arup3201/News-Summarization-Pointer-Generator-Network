An Iraq war veteran who has lived with extensive injuries since being paralyzed during the conflict has admitted that he no longer has the will to live.

For nearly a decade, veteran Tomas Young, has been living in chronic pain after being paralyzed by a sniper's bullet four days into his first assignment in the Middle East.

Now the married 33-year-old, who can no longer eat solid foods, plans to refuse nourishment as he is tired of the exhaustive struggle that his life has become.

Sick and tired: Tomas Young was paralyzed his fourth day serving in Iraq in 2004; now in hospice care, he is planning to refuse nourishment in a few weeks after a string of health complications

Injured: Tomas, pictured in 2007, was hit by a sniper's bullet in Iraq in 2004

All you need is love: Claudia, pictured with Tomas, says their journey together has been hard but not sad

Two days after the September 11 
attacks, Mr Young, from Kansas City, Oklahoma, joined the Army to 
serve his country in a time of chaos.

In 2004, Mr Young was sent to Sadr City, Iraq. Four days after being deployed, he was shot by a sniper.

He was hit in the collarbone on April 4 while riding in an unarmored Humvee and was instantly paralyzed.

The
 unconscious private was transferred to the Walter Reed Army Medical 
Center outside of Washington, D.C., by way of Kuwait and Germany.

Speaking with the Kansas City Star, Young said that his wife, Claudia Cuellar understands and supports his decision to die.

‘I’m sick and tired of being sick 
and tired,’ he explained to the paper, adding that his medications 
frequently leave him lethargic and nauseated.’

Mr Young was fitted with a colostomy bag meaning that he 
can no longer eat solid foods. His wife doesn’t cook anymore so as to 
help her husband not to think about food.

Now in hospice care, Young says his mind is clear.

Men of war: In his note, Young blasts former President George W. Bush, pictured on March 13, 2003, and former Vice President Dick Cheney, who once said 'the American people will not support a policy of retreat' amid complaints during the increasingly unpopular war

‘You
 don’t have to struggle through every day just to make it because you’re
 expected by society to endure until you die naturally or are murdered,’
 he told the Star.

Speaking with Democracy Now, Young
 said that nothing would change his decision to end his life. He said 
that if he weren’t in constant pain, he would explore other options.

‘We wouldn’t be having this conversation,’ he said.

He hopes his public struggles, death and legacy will bring more attention to the terrible price of the war.

Mr Young,
 who was featured in the powerful 2007 documentary ‘Body of War,’ has 
published a letter on the 10th anniversary of the Iraq conflict on TruthDig.com.

'You may evade justice, but in our eyes 
you are each guilty of egregious war crimes, of plunder and, finally, of
 murder, including the murder of thousands of young Americans whose future you stole.'

As one of his final, poignant acts, the veteran addressed former president George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney accusing them of ‘egregious war crimes of plunder and finally of murder'.

He spoke out against the former leaders for starting a war that he says achieved 
nothing but killing and maiming a generation of soldiers, all while furthering America's thirst for oil.

Mr Young writes: ‘I write 
this letter, my last letter, to you, Mr Bush and Mr Cheney.

'I write not 
because I think you grasp the terrible human and moral consequences of 
your lies, manipulation and thirst for wealth and power.

‘I
 write this letter because, before my own death, I want to make it clear
 that I, and hundreds of thousands of my fellow veterans, along with 
millions of my fellow citizens, along with hundreds of millions more in 
Iraq and the Middle East, know fully who you are and what you have 
done.’

The veteran continues: ‘You may evade justice, but in our eyes you are each
 guilty of egregious war crimes, of plunder and, finally, of murder, 
including the murder of thousands of young Americans – my fellow 
veterans – whose future you stole.'

It isn’t the first time the war-wounded veteran has expressed his opinion on the war. He was featured in Phil Donahue’s 2007 documentary, ‘Body of War,’ and also spoke with ’60 Minutes’ about his ordeal.

‘Body of War’ explored Young’s many health issues, which include a brain injury, a 
pulmonary embolism and a blockage of the lung.

Much like Ron Kovic, a 
patriot-turned-anti-war-activist from the Vietnam war, Young began 
seeing his country in a different light following his time on the 
frontlines.

He saw on the news that his friends 
and fellow American soldiers were still being killed in Iraq, even 
though there were no so-called weapons of mass destruction in the 
country, and began a slow shift to becoming a voice against the Iraq 
War.

In the closing of his letter, he writes: ‘My day of reckoning is upon me. Yours will come. I hope you will be put on trial.

'But
 mostly I hope for your sakes, that you find the moral courage to face 
what you have done to me and to many, many others who deserved to live.’
