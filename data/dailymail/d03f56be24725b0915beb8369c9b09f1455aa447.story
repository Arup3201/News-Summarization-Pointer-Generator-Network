An unprovoked attack by a drunken stranger left Wayne Urwin not only fighting for his life, but it has permanently changed his appearance and cost him him his home, his job and his car.

The father-of-two needed emergency surgery to ease bleeding on his brain after Aaron Robson knocked him to the ground with a single punch after spotting him outside a Northumberland pub.

And as the 37-year-old lay unconscious in the Morpeth allegyway, his 20-year-old attacker kept punching him until a stranger intervened and told him to stop. 

Wayne Urwin's head now sinks to one side following an unprovoked attack outside a bar, and his two children are now 'frightened' of his appearance

Mr Urwin has been left with a scar that snakes across the side of his head and is awaiting reconstructive surgery which will include having a metal plate put in his head

The father-of-two was placed in an induced coma after the assault on March 30 and spent a month in hospital recovering; his family were told he might not survive

Mr Urwin now has a huge scar around his head and his skull slopes down on one side. Throughout the day his head changes shape and he is still awaiting reconstructive surgery, including the implant of a metal plate in his head.

Mr Urwin said of the March 30 assault: ‘One punch ruined my life.'

Robson, of Cramlington, was jailed for three years and two months after appearing at Newcastle Crown Court on Thursday, but Urwin said his life has been changed forever.

He said: 'My life has completely changed and I struggle to see a way back to normality.'

Mr Urwin said Robson is likely to be released from prison within 19 months, 'which to me is ridiculous'.

He said: 'It’s going to take much more than 19 months to get over this. It’s probably going to effect me for the rest of my life.'

Mr Urwin, a budding DJ and warehouse supervisor, was leaving a pub after a night out with friends when he encountered Robson.

After being taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle he was placed in an induced coma as doctors battled to save his life.

His devastated family were told to expect the worst, and were warned it was unlikely Mr Urwin would survive.

Against the odds, a month later he returned home - but everything had changed.

Unable to work, Mr Urwin was forced to give up the flat he rented in Cramlington and move in with his girlfriend. He also had to sell his car.

The incident caused significant stress for his children, Marley, seven, and four-year-old Georgina. The children live with his ex and because he has a brain injury and is prone to seizures, he can't drive to see them.

Mr Urwin said: 'It’s so hard not to be able to see them as much as I did.

'This has changed everything.'

In a victim impact statement read to court he described how his children were 'frightened to look at me' and how he had lost the 'closeness I had with them'.

His statement said: 'I can’t play with them or lift them up.

'As the day goes by my head starts to sink down. I know I look strange.'

Mr Urwin said his brain injury has also significantly changed his personality. Where he was once 'laid back', he now has a short-temper.

In mitigation Richard Bloomfield said Robson, who had earlier pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm without intent, was: 'A young man who has never been in this situation before. He’s of good character and is described as hard-working and caring. He is extremely remorseful.'

But Judge Hickey said he had no choice but to jail him because of the 'catastrophic effect' the attack had on Mr Urwin's life.
