These astonishing photos from a 1970s study give a fascinating insight into the behind-the-scenes working life of New York City police officers.

It was a time when the city was facing near-bankruptcy and had become notorious for spiralling crime rates and social disorder on the streets.

Photographer Leonard Freed joined officers on the beat for his project, which went on display at the Museum of the City of New York on Tuesday.

The pictures first appeared in the Sunday Times in March 1973 under the controversial headline of: ‘Thugs, Mugs, Drugs; City In Terror’.

The New York Daily News sued the Sunday Times for copying its style and the New York Times protested at the depiction, a museum press release said.

Even New York City Mayor John Lindsay, who was on holiday abroad, slammed the Sunday Times article as ‘a gross insult to the city’ and ‘outrageous’.

1978: 'New York City, Dectectives at Police Station' is in a set of pictures - the first of which appeared in a Sunday British newspaper five years before in 1973

But Mr Freed did not set out to offend people - rather perform a sociological study - and claimed he had been asked for ‘blood and gore’.

‘I was more interested in who the police were,’ he told Worldview magazine. ‘I wanted to understand what they do - why we cannot do without them.’

Mr Freed lived in Garrison, New York, with his wife, and also photographed subjects including the Ku Klux Klan in 1988 and the Berlin Wall in 1989.
