The Prince of Wales has revealed that his sons the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry have inherited an essential quality from their father - a love of dancing.

Charles joked about his prowess on the dance floor and how William and Harry have picked up the skill during a wide-ranging interview with the magazine Australian Women's Weekly.

The heir to the throne also spoke of his joy at the warm reception the Duchess of Cornwall received from Australians last year.

Charles hit the Dance-O-Mat with Lisa Shannon during a visit to Christchurch, New Zealand last year, but says at his age he dances less

Prince Harry showed off his moves when he was invited to dance by Chantol Dormer, when he visited Rise Life, a youth charity project in Kingston, Jamaica last year

Charles and Camilla made their first official visit to the country as a couple last November, and the royal described his delight after wellwishers realised she was 'an incredibly good sort'.

The royal was first interviewed by the magazine in 1974 when, aged 26, he declared, 'If I hear rhythmic music, I just want to get up and dance.'

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Tuvalu and danced with the ladies at the Vaiku Falekaupule

Asked by the publication's deputy editor Juliet Rieden if he still felt the beat, Charles, who became a grandfather for the first time in July, repled: 'Perhaps, it's slightly less becoming once you get to my age.'

He added: 'I think given half a chance though, the old one-two and the two-step can come in handy. I'm glad to say that both my sons have inherited it, I think.

'They're very good. They do make me laugh when they get going.'

The Duke clearly amused his wife as he demonstrated his 'swagger' dance moves with Vanessa Boateng during a reception at Centrepoint's Camberwell Foyer in London in 2011

It is easy to see why Prince Harry makes his father laugh when he 'gets going' on the dance floor when you see him dancing with local women during a walkabout at a 'block party' in Belmopan, Belize, central America during the Diamond Jubilee world tour

Harry was spotted dancing numerous times during his Diamond Jubilee tour of the Caribbean last year - especially in Kingston when he visited a charity.

And when Charles and Camilla travelled to New Zealand at the end of their Diamond Jubilee tour, they both strutted their stuff with different partners on a pop-up dancefloor in Christchurch.

Asked if he was passing his wisdom on to William and Harry, Charles suggested his sons had learnt from him - but wanted to keep it a secret.

Charles, seen here trying his hand at Latin dancing at a state banquet in 1999 in Buenos Aires, says even nowadays 'the old one-two and the two-step can come in handy'

He said: 'Well, I don't know. I hope so. How do you know? You can try, but no, I've always believed I just do what I do and I hope that they might notice something.

'I mean, funnily enough, I don't see what they're up to when I'm not there, but sometimes I hear back from others that they're surprisingly similar in some ways (to me). So maybe some things rub off ... which they wouldn't want me to know.'

Speaking about last year's Australian visit, which marked the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, the prince told the women's magazine: 'Before you go, you wonder what is the reaction going to be - it's always the same. But it was wonderful that they took to her and saw her for what she is - an incredibly good sort.

'She loved it and has such incredibly happy memories of her experience and, obviously, I was thrilled, as you can imagine, for Australians to discover just how special she is ... because she's got the most wonderful sense of humour and has some very good jokes.'

Charles' first wife Diana, Princess of Wales made a lasting impression on Australians during numerous visits and the Duchess appears to have also won the affections of many people in the country.

The first stop for the royals during their tour was the remote outback settlement of Longreach and Camilla endeared herself to the locals by cuddling a 12-month-old kangaroo.

The prince still has fond memories of his first visit to Australia, made in 1966 when he was aged 17.

The royal spent two terms in the Australian outback at Timbertop, an off-shoot of Geelong Grammar School in Melbourne, on a private exchange from Gordonstoun.

During the visit the prince said he plucked up the courage to really talk to the public and learnt to communicate with wellwishers.

Speaking about the crowds that had come out to see him Charles said: 'Then, of course, finally, I took the plunge and went over and talked to people, and that suddenly unlocked a completely different feeling and I was then able to communicate and talk to people so much more.'

While at Timbertop, 100 miles from Melbourne, the prince joined the other pupils who had to fend for themselves and complete expeditions into the surrounding hills.

He said: 'There were leeches and snakes, and those enormous bull ants and funnel web spiders I've never forgotten. And then waking up in your tent and you're frozen stiff in the frost.

'I never imagined that would happen in that part of the world - or all these strange creepy crawlies wanting to do you mischief. But it was jolly good for the character and, in many ways, I loved it and I learnt a lot from it. And I certainly discovered what good value the Australians are.'

Speaking about the issues that motivate him the royal said that we had created a 'throwaway society'.

He stressed that nations had to look after the natural world: 'What I'm trying to say is there is another way of looking at this if we're going to hand over to our children and grandchildren a planet that isn't totally degraded and compromised. You can't push nature beyond a certain limit. We have to look after it.'

Charles and Camilla made their first official visit to Australia as a couple last November, and the royal described his delight after wellwishers realised she was 'an incredibly good sort'

Speaking about his views on balancing conventional medicine with complimentary treatments he said: 'I know lots of people who find they aren't benefited in every case by just the conventional, orthodox drug and finally discover that actually an approach - whether it's herbal medicine or acupuncture or various other forms of complementary medicine - actually does benefit them.

'There's a lot that can be done on the preventative side. There's an enormous amount we can do by looking at the whole person.'

Charles also stressed that he wanted to see if some of his UK charities could link up with Australian counterparts to tackle issues.

One project already off the ground will see the Prince's Foundation for Building Community develop the 'Prince's Australian Terrace' in Melbourne.

The development will be an update to the popular Australian terraced house, combining 21st century Australian lifestyle demands with the technology of today which aims to create a sustainable and eco-friendly living solution.
