He’s knocked his opponents senseless in the ring but Mike Tyson admitted defeat in a bear-knuckle confrontation with a koala in Brisbane, Australia.

The former world heavyweight champion, 46, threw in the towel when he was given the chance of cuddling a koala called Tracy, declaring that she might just put the bite on him.

That, he was anxious to make clear, was in no way meant as a reminder of his famous ear-bite of Evander Holyfield.

‘I’ve seen the TV show When Good Animals Turn Bad,’ he said as his excuse for not taking Tracy into his arms, even though he once owned three tigers.

Apart from being concerned about those claws, he added: ‘They also carry bacteria.’

So having conceded defeat in the first round of a ‘friendly’ with the koala, he was anxious to make the point that he was in Australia to spread the message that people should try to ignore the bad times.

Not a chance! The former boxer wouldn't give the koala a cuddle, for fear of getting scratched or bitten

Of his speaking tour of the country, he said: ‘The message of my show would be no matter what adversity hits you in life, don’t give up – that’s the only time you will lose.

‘Some can be a champion and never have a title.’

He even hoped that his former opponent Holyfield would hear his message after learning that the four-time champion was in financial trouble.

‘We all have to endure some kind of pain,’ said ‘Iron Mike’.

‘I like Evander. Evander’s going to be all right.

Tyson’s own downward spiral began in 1990 when, after winning his first 37 professional bouts, he was knocked out by Buster Douglas.

Two years later he was jailed for rape and later he admitted to squandering some $300 million. It didn’t get any better when he was embroiled in the ear-biting scandal in the fight with Holyfield.

At the age of 39, he retired for good in 2005 – but he admits he’s ‘the same guy – I just grew up a little bit’.

Although women’s groups and community leaders are appalled that the Australian government gave him a visa, he said he was now very different to his old title of ‘the baddest man on the planet’.
