Tiny robots built to mimic human movements are now so advanced they can - in theory - fly light aircraft.

A replica robotic human, no more than five inches tall, has been filmed at the controls of a flight simulator, from which it can control a small airplane.

The device - a diminutive model called the PIBOT - is able to taxi the stationary plane, complete a take-off, finish a short flight and bring the plane in to approach the runway.

The technology was exhibited at a robotics conference in Chicago this week, according to science magazine IEEE Spectrum.

Landing the plane - the final and most complicated step - still requires human assistance, but it is hoped this too will be mastered soon. 

In footage from the event, the PIBOT is seen flicking switches on a pilots' console, then clamping down on a joystick to steer the plane as it soars through the sky. 

Part of the feat is achieved by the robot being pre-programmed to know where the buttons are and how to press them.

Data feeds from the simulator also influence parts of steering, such as the pitch, roll and yaw of the craft. 

But the some of the steering is achieved by the machine's webcam seeing the simulation of the ground and sky - and reacting accordingly.

During the entire simulation, the robot receives no external inputs and makes all the decisions itself.

The details of the technology were laid out in a research paper called A Robot-Machine Interface for Full-functionality Automation using a Humanoid, by Heejin Jeong, David Hyunchul Shim and Sungwook Cho, scientists from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology.

While the footage from the event reveals some abrupt twists and turns from the robot pilot, the movements are technically viable, if jerky.

Indeed the inventors behind the modified PIBOT are so confident in its flying abilities that they think it could meet Government guidelines for flying real airplanes.

One said: 'PIBOT can satisfy the various requirements specified in the flying handbook by the Federal Aviation Administration.'
