A mother who stabbed her two young sons to death has told how she had believed she was being pursued by the devil and how voices told her she must kill them.

Jael Mullings killed Romario Mullings-Sewell, two, and his three-month-old brother Delayno at their home in Kilimington Drive, Cheetham Hill, Manchester in 2008.

She wiped tears from her eyes yesterday as she spoke via a video link from a secure hospital during an inquest into the children's deaths at Manchester Crown Court.

Tragedy: Romario Mullings-Sewell, left and his brother Delayno, right, were stabbed by their mother in Cheetham Hill in 2008

Mullings told the court: 'At the time
 Romario was born, I started suffering from paranoia. When Delayno was 
born I started to turn really psychotic. I couldn’t cope. I was getting 
no support from the children’s father.

'From there it built up and became 
worse. I was 
hearing lots of different voices. They were telling me to kill the 
children. They were saying all these different things. I can’t remember 
exactly what they said. They were telling me to kill the children,' she 
told the court.'

It was the first time she has spoken since she was sectioned indefinitely in 2009 after killing her children on November 12 2008.

Mullings, then 21, had denied murder and pleaded manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

The children's bodies were discovered by their uncle Leighton Dennis, who became concerned when his sister arrived at his house after killing them.

She said she thought she would lose her home and that a Manchester City Council van was following her, and that she steadily became more paranoid.

'The TV was doing sign language and trying to say things to me. I was hallucinating. I thought the devil was after me. I was speaking in tongues. I was talking gibberish. I went into this religious mode. I had to do everything from the Bible. I felt I had to circumcise the children. I think it was the night before.'

Mullings said she became 'confused and psychotic' and that she 'thought everyone was after me'.

'I thought they were going to take the kids off me, which would be devastating. I was having full-blown conversations with myself. I thought I was speaking in my head but I was speaking out loud.'

She told the court she took full responsibility for killing her children and said: 'If I had dealt with these problems, things would have been different.'

'I loved my children. I wasn’t thinking about trying to kill them or taking their lives. I was scared and I was psychotic. I didn’t know what was going on. I wanted to kill myself.

'I think I had been smoking too much weed and smoking something other than I normally smoked.The memories are like flashes. I don’t remember things in order. I just know that I did the killings. I put them on the bed and I went to my auntie’s house.

'I tried to stab myself in the heart, but I missed and was too scared to try it again. I wanted a way out. I couldn’t cope with how I was feeling. I loved them with all my heart. I did my best. If I knew then what I know now, they would still be here.'

The inquest continues.
