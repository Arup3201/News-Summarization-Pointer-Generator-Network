Dashawn Harris was discovered by police in the early hours of Saturday, his body covered with bruises, cigarette burns and belt marks.

According to family who live nearby, Patrick became angry with the child while he was teaching him to read during a home schooling session and beat Dashawn with a belt and hairdryer.

Relatives said they believed Dashawn's three-year-old brother Daqwon was also abused. Daqwon is now in the custody of his father.

Grace Fitch,  Dashawn's paternal grandmother, told ABC: 'I can't believe she did that. Shay was just the 
sweetest person you could meet and when she got with this guy she just 
started getting distant.'

She said her son was unaware of how his young sons were being treated. Patrick was known to police and had a history of drugs, according to philly.com.

The Philadelphia Department of Human Services refused to comment on the incident or say if there was an open case involving the family.
