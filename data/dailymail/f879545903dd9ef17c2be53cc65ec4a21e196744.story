Fifty Shades of Grey, the best-selling tale of erotic romance, perpetuates the problem of violence against women, according to a new study

Fifty Shades of Grey, the best-selling tale of erotic romance, perpetuates the problem of violence against women, according to a new study.

Reporting in the Journal of Women's Health, Dr Amy Bonomi concluded that emotional and sexual abuse is pervasive in the novel, with the main female character, Anastasia, suffering harm as a result.

About 25 per cent of women are victims of violence by intimate partners.

‘This book is perpetuating dangerous abuse standards and yet it's being cast as this romantic, erotic book for women,’ said Dr Bonomi, lead author of the study.

‘The erotic content could have been accomplished without the theme of abuse.’

The book is a best-seller in the US and the UK and in the last 12 months alone has netted author E L James a staggering £61.4million ($94.9million).

The strong sales have propelled the London-based author into the pole position on Forbes' list of successful writers - leapfrogging rival James Patterson who trailed by £2.5million ($3.9million).

The researchers, at Ohio State University, conducted a systematic analysis of the novel to clarify patterns consistent with Centres for Disease Control and Prevention definitions of intimate partner violence, and associated reactions known to occur in abused women.

Anastasia suffers reactions consistent with those of abused women.

She feels a constant sense of threat and loss of self-identity, changes her behaviours to keep peace in the relationship, and becomes disempowered and entrapped in the relationship.

The news comes after it was revealed that since the release of Fifty Shades of Grey fire fighters have been called to more and more people who are handcuffed to their beds.

London Fire Brigade alone said it had been called to 79 such incidents and urged people to 'always keep the keys handy'.

Third officer Dave Brown, said: 'Some 
of the incidents our fire fighters are called out to could be prevented 
with a little common sense.

'I
don't know whether it's the Fifty Shades effect, but the number of 
incidents involving items like handcuffs seems to have gone up.

'I'm sure most people will be fifty shades of red by the time our crews arrive to free them.'

Written by E.L. James and published in 2011, Fifty Shades of Grey has sold more than 70 million copies and set the record as the fastest-selling paperback of all time.

A film based on the novel is now being made.
