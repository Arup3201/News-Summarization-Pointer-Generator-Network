Health officials have been banned from shaking hands with those arriving from Ebola-hit countries just days after the practice was defended.

Immigration officers at Heathrow Airport were criticised for shaking hands with passengers on the chaotic first day of Britain's airport screening procedures this week.

Public Health England (PHE), which is in charge of the screening process, originally defended the practice, saying there was no evidence the virus could be caught through hand contact.

Health officials screening arrivals at UK airports are being told not to shake hands with passengers, despite a statement put out earlier this week claiming the practice was safe 

Officials were criticised over screening procedures earlier this week after it emerged they are not compulsory

But despite sticking to that claim, the organisation has now told its staff not to shake hands with arrivals as an 'extra precaution'.

Passengers arriving from West African countries hit out at the screening process on Tuesday, with some branded it 'a complete joke'.

Sorius Samura, who flew in from Liberia, told the Telegraph: 'I've just come back  via Brussels and our flight was met by an airport official saying we might be screened.

'He even shook our hands. That's something nobody does now in Liberia and infected countries, you have to learn not to.'

He said officials in Liberian airports were much more organised about making sure the infection did not spread.

PHE later shrugged off the claims, insisting: 'If you are well enough to be getting on the plane and walking off the other end, you are not symptomatic and would not pass the disease on by shaking hands with someone.' 

Passengers said they were shocked that immigration officials were shaking hands with those flying in

Today however, just two days later, it emerged that the organisation were telling their own staff to refrain from shaking hands with new arrivals.

A PHE spokesperson said today: 'Unless you have come into contact with the blood or bodily fluid of an infected person, for example by providing healthcare for a person with Ebola or handling the dead body of someone who died from Ebola, there is little chance of being infected.

'Ebola virus disease is not spread through intact skin, or by ordinary social contact, such as shaking hands or sitting next to someone. People who are well are not at risk of transmitting the virus.

'However, we have advised PHE staff responsible for screening people from countries with endemic Ebola to not shake their hands.

'This is because they are travelling from a high risk area and therefore extra precaution must be taken. This is covered within the training which all staff undertaking screening are being given.

'However this does not change our public health advice to members of the public, which remains the same.'

The spokesman added: 'If there is physical contact between screening staff and passengers on occasion – such as a handshake or through temperature checking – this does not present any significant health risk.

'PHE has also been working closely with Heathrow management teams to review advice to a range of airport staff.

'We are confident that there are sufficient, sensible safeguards built into existing working arrangements, which remain appropriate for their protection, at this time.'

British authorities were heavily criticised on the first day of screening at airports when it emerged checks were not compulsory and only those who 'show symptoms of the virus' were being spoken to.

Clive Patterson, 32, who flew in from Liberia, said: 'If you are going to make the effort and take this measure, you might as well make it compulsory. I could have Ebola and I could have walked straight through.'

Passengers arriving from Britain from high risk areas are being subject to screening at Heathrow. 

They are being asked to complete a questionnaire asking about their current health and where they have come from.

As well as personal details, including name, nationality, address in UK and phone number they have been asked:

Currently do you have any of the following:

The advice from PHE emerged as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted it was only a matter of time before someone with the disease arrived in Britain.

Speaking to reporters during a ministerial visit to the West Midlands, he said: 'I think we will see someone with Ebola arriving in the UK and the Chief Medical Officer thinks it will be a handful of cases in the next three months.

'We have to be prepared. We have very strict procedures and we have to make sure everyone knows those procedures.'

It is estimated the death toll from the Ebola crisis will rise to more than 4,500 lives this week from among 9,000 people infected by the deadly disease.

Dr Isabelle Nuttall of the World Health Organisation said the new numbers also show the outbreak is hitting health workers hard, with 2,700 infected and 236 dead.

She told reporters in Geneva that cases are doubling every four weeks, and the effects of the crisis are increasingly being felt beyond its epicentre in West Africa.

After speaking to US president Barack Obama and the leaders of Germany, France and Italy by video conference call yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron was today chairing the latest meeting of the Government's Cobra contingencies committee in Whitehall to discuss the UK's response.

A No 10 spokeswoman said: 'The Prime Minister said we would welcome countries partnering with us in Sierra Leone so that we can provide more treatment beds and we will now explore this further with the Italians.'

Mr Cameron called for further discussions when European and Asian leaders gather in Italy tomorrow for a pre-planned summit.
