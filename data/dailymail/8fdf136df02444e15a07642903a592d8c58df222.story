Hearing: Pc Mike Baillon is pictured with his solicitor Jean Norton outside the tribunal in Cardiff today

A police officer became a ‘laughing stock’ over a YouTube video of him using a truncheon to smash into a disabled pensioner's car, an employment tribunal was told today.

Pc Mike Baillon, 42, allegedly quit his job after becoming the butt of jokes from fellow officers over CCTV footage of him battering the Range Rover of 74-year-old driver Robert Whatley, near Usk in Monmouthshire, South Wales.

The video of Pc Baillon wielding his truncheon was viewed more than 30million times on YouTube, leading him to walk out of his job after being ridiculed every day by his fellow police officers, the hearing was told.

The former traffic officer is now suing 
police chiefs for constructive dismissal after being relieved of 
carrying out frontline duties and also claiming damages for allegedly 
being bullied by fellow officers.

Extreme: Pc Mike Baillon, 42, quit his job after becoming the butt of jokes from fellow officers over the CCTV of him battering the Range Rover

Damage: Mr Whatley was ordered to pay £235 after being found guilty of speeding and failing to stop for police

Legal victory: Robert Whatley won £20,000 compensation from police after officers smashed his car windows

Pc Baillon told the hearing: ‘The ridicule from 
colleagues was getting to me - it was every single day. They thought I 
had done wrong and I was lucky to have got away with it. I just wanted 
my closure.’

Pc Mike Baillon

He was one of two police officers 
chasing stroke victim Mr Whatley as he drove along country roads without
a seatbelt, before pulling him over in his black £60,000 Range Rover in
2009.

Mr Whatley expected the officers to 
gently knock on his window, but instead Pc Baillon attacked it with a 
baton 15 times while his colleague climbed onto the bonnet and kicked in
the windscreen.

The officers were cleared of
misconduct after an internal investigation but Pc Baillon was removed from 
frontline duties and his colleagues often brought up the ‘Whatley 
incident’, the tribunal heard.

On camera: As the window was being smashed in, an officer was on the bonnet stamping on the windscreen

Shocked: The two officers were later cleared of misconduct after an investigation but Pc Baillon was removed from front-line duties and his colleagues often brought up the 'Whatley incident', a tribunal heard

After another incident where police forced an entry by smashing a door a colleague allegedly told him: ‘It wasn't a window.’

Mr Baillon also told the tribunal in 
Cardiff that his locker at work was defaced over the ‘Whatley incident’ 
and that he became a ‘laughing stock’. The experienced officer finally took sick leave for stress and wrote letters of complaint to the Gwent Police Authority.

Former police Superintendent James 
Baker told the tribunal that he was taken off front-line duties because 
Pc Baillon's mental state could have impaired his ability to respond to 
high-speed chases.

Mr Whatley won a £20,000 payout from 
the police over the damage caused to his Range Rover. He was later 
ordered to pay £235 after being found guilty of speeding and failing to 
stop for police.

The tribunal continues.
