Team news

Manchester City

Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has been passed fit for the champions' Barclays Premier League clash with Swansea at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.

The key centre-back missed City's last game against QPR a fortnight ago and Belgium's Euro 2016 qualifier against Wales with a calf injury but returned to training this week.

Fellow defender Eliaquim Mangala has also overcome a knock but playmaker David Silva (knee), left-back Aleksandar Kolarov and striker Edin Dzeko (both calf) have all been ruled out.

Provisional squad: Hart, Caballero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Demichelis, Kompany, Mangala, Boyata, Clichy, Navas, Milner, Nasri, Toure, Fernando, Fernandinho, Lampard, Aguero, Jovetic.

Swansea

Swansea welcome back Jonjo Shelvey for the Barclays Premier League visit to Manchester City on Saturday.

Shelvey missed the 2-1 home victory over Arsenal before the international break after being sent off at Everton and should replace on-loan Tottenham midfielder Tom Carroll at the Etihad Stadium.

Wayne Routledge and Nathan Dyer are back in the squad after missing the Arsenal win with groin strains, as is Jordi Amat who has been out for two months with knee trouble, but Argentina centre-half Federico Fernandez is sidelined by a calf injury.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Rangel, Bartley, Williams, Taylor, Ki, Shelvey, Montero, Routledge, Sigurdsson, Bony, Tremmel, Amat, Britton, Carroll, Emnes, Dyer, Gomis, Barrow, Tiendalli, Fulton, Shephard.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Sergio Aguero has scored 12 goals in 11 Premier League games this season and just nine of those appearances were starts.

Wilfried Bony scored two goals in the last meeting between these two sides, his only appearance against Man City in the Premier League.

Aguero has the best minutes per goal rate of any player in Premier League history with more than 20 goals, scoring on average every 107 minutes.

Manchester City have won four and lost just one of the six Premier League meetings with Swansea City.

Alvaro Negredo celebrates scoring the opening goal in a 3-0 win for Manchester City over Swansea during the side's previous Etihad Stadium clash back in December

Despite their stuttering form, this is still Manchester City’s fourth best start to a Premier League season and they have one point more than last season after 11 matches.

18 points after 11 games is Swansea City’s best start to a Premier League campaign, beating the 13 they accrued at this point in 2011-12 and 2012-13.

Swansea have conceded the highest percentage of second half goals in the Premier League this season (73 per cent).

Manchester City are the only team in the Premier League without an ever present starter this season.

Under Manuel Pellegrini, Manchester City have won 20 and lost just two of their 24 Premier League games at the Etihad Stadium.

Swansea’s last Premier League away win came in Manchester when they beat United on the opening day of this season. Since then they have a record of W0 D2 L2.
