An arrest has been made as part of the homicide investigation into the death of six-year-old Washington girl Jenise Wright.

A 17-year-old male will be charged with second-degree murder, first-degree manslaughter and child rape after forensic evidence linked the teenager to Wright, detective Lt. Earl Smith of the Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office during an afternoon press conference Saturday. 

A major part of the investigation centered on collecting DNA cheek swabs from residents of the mobile home park where Wright lived with her parents in Bremerton.

The little was last seen at the park on Saturday night, with search crews finding her body in nearby woodlands on Thursday.

'Yesterday, we made a promise to 6-year-old Jenise Paulette Wright that we would find justice for her. Today we have fulfilled that promise,' Kitsap County sheriff’s Lt. Earl Smith told reporters Saturday, according to NBC.

Tragic: According to court documents, Jenise Wright died of blunt force trauma to the head, and there was evidence she was strangled.

Scene: Law enforcement officers investigate at the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park on Tuesday, August 5, 2014, in Bremerton, Washington. DINA evidence from the scene lead them to the arrest of Gabriel Gaeta

An autopsy proved she was murdered, however the cause of death has not been released.

Police do not know whether the 17-year-old suspect - who was not named - knew Wright.

Sheriff's
 office spokesman Scott Wilson said earlier Friday that the wooded area 
where an FBI team found the body contained thick brush and likely was 
muddy.

He said the person responsible for the girl's disappearance likely would have been covered in mud.

Wright's family has said she was an outgoing girl.

'She was a happy child, a bright light for those around her,' Smith said.

The FBI's Specialty Search Dogs Unit discovered the body after volunteer canine search teams reported their dogs showed interest in a particular area.

Jenise was last seen when she went to bed Saturday night. Her parents waited a day before calling for help because they said the girl had wandered around the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park on her own in the past.

Wilson said Thursday there were no signs of forced entry at Jenise's home and no indication she was taken from her room.

Murdered: An autopsy concluded Jenise was a homicide victim, and her body was found Thursday in an area near the mobile-home community where she lived with her family

Parents: Denise Almojera Wright and James 'Jim' Wright told police their daughter would often roam around the mobile home park alone

The girl's parents are cooperating with authorities, he said.

Hundreds of people, including officers from 15 law enforcement agencies, searched for Jenise, going door to door at  the mobile home park on the west side of Puget Sound, across from Seattle.

They also pulled surveillance video from nearby businesses and checked in with sex offenders in the county.

After the search began, state child welfare workers removed two other children, an 8-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl, from the home.

Jenise Wright's father, James Wright, was charged more than a decade ago with molesting two girls, ages 8 and 15, court records show.

He eventually pleaded guilty in Whatcom County Superior Court in December 2001 to a misdemeanor assault charge related to the older girl.

It was not immediately clear why the molestation charges were dropped. Prosecutors there did not return calls.

A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire jail term on the condition that he follow certain conditions, including paying fees.

Wilson has said authorities were aware of the past charge against the father, but officers were focused on finding the girl.

Jenise was well-known among her neighbors and was so friendly that she would have breakfast with one family and lunch with others, authorities have said
