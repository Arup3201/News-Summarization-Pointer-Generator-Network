Forest boy: Artist's impression of 'Ray' who claimed he lived in the wild

The mysterious 'Forest Boy' who claimed to have spent years in woods has never lived in the wild, according to German police.

They now suspect the story of 17-year-old Ray' after examination of his clothes and tent revealed no sign they had been used for very long in the open.

The English-speaking teenager, who refuses to have his picture taken to help find his family, appeared at Berlin City Hall early last month.

He said he had lived five years in the forest with his father Ryan after the death of his mother Doreen in a car accident.

He claimed that when his father died suddenly in August he buried him among trees, and then walked for two weeks to Berlin using a compass and map.

But police and social workers began suspecting two weeks ago that his story was bogus andÂ  his motives were suspect.

They cannot understand why the only personal details he has revealed are his birthday and first name. He has told investigators he has no memory of his past.

But doctors say he is in in perfect health with no signs of amnesia or mental problems.

Ray has refused to provide a DNA sample despite a Swiss couple coming forward last week to claim he could be there grandson and agreeing to be tested.

Lost in translation: The boy turned up in Berlin alone and saying he had been living rough in the woods

The teen told police he was not 
interested in establishing his identity, and simply wanted to start a 
new life after the death of his parents.

He is now in the care of social workers after a legal guardian was appointed to represent his interests.

If it is found that he comes from Switzerland he will be deported back there.

No sign of his father's grave has been found in 
cursory searches of forests in the Harz Mountains, along the 
Bavarian-Czech border or in Thuringia.

Wilderness: The teenager's history is shrouded in mystery and he refuses to have his picture taken

A check of police computers in all 16 
states of Germany found that no one by the name of Doreen had died in a 
car crash in the past decade.

Ray is unable to pinpoint the forest 
where he said he lived, he is also unable to say what nationality he is.
Officials originally thought he could be British because he speaks 
English but only basic German, although they now doubt this.

Interpol has been alerted to check with police forces for missing people in other European countries,

Ray told police: 'I'm all alone. Please help. I just want to get on and make a new life for myself.'

The only image of Ray that has been released under Germany's privacy laws is an artist's impression based on photographs taken by social services.
