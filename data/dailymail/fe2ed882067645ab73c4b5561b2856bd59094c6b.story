A computer science student who boasts of sleeping with up to three men every week has been named Britain's Horniest Student after entering a degrading online competition.

Elina Desaine, 20, doesn't even know the names of all her sexual partners, but tries to keep track with handwritten list using descriptions such as 'French guy' and 'third year' to recall her trysts.

The University of Exeter student received £500 and a year's supply of condoms after winning the competition run by controversial 'no strings attached fun' website, Shagatuni.com.

'Shag list': Elina doesn't know how many people she has slept with or even the names of some of her sexual partners

Latvian-born Elina who refers to herself as a 'Slutvian' and 'Sexeter', said winning the contest has made her 'even hornier'.

The former pupil of the £4,000-a-term James Allens Girls' School said one of her proudest moments is having sex in a university computer room, and admitted her ultimate goal is to seduce a lecturer.

Despite being begged by her housemates to take tests for sexually transmitted illnesses, the student claims she is 'just having fun'.

'All my friends are the same - we are all just up for having a great time and going out.

'Uni life is three years to be wild before it starts settling down and it really flies by.'

The third year IT management student keeps a list of her sexual partners or, in her words, 'conquests' but struggles to remember all their names.

'I have to put descriptions or question marks instead of names.'

The self-proclaimed 'modern-day feminist' entered the competition after being encouraged by a friend who said she had a 'reputation for having fun'.

'My friends were worried about what future employers might say but I hope they see it as a bit of fun, and it shows I am more confident than the average girl.'

Entrants were encouraged to post pleas to win the title on the 'casual dating' website's Facebook page.

Elina, who was just one of hundreds of male and female candidates, wrote: 'I should be the UK's horniest student because I have sex with at least 2/3 different people a week.

The student listed having sex in a computer room and sleeping with two university union bartenders as some of her biggest achievements

'Sometimes I go clubbing, have sex with someone, and then go back to the club to pick my second victim'.

‘I should be the UK’s horniest student because I have sex with at least 2 / 3 different people a week.

'Sometimes I go clubbing, have sex with someone, and then go back to the club to pick up my second victim.

'Feeling horny right now, so might just text someone on my ‘shag list’ and do it in the computer room (I’ve done this before, was great!)

'With your help of Alcohol (sic) I will be able to become an even Hornier Student!’

'Feeling
 horny right now, so might just text someone on my ‘shag list’ and do it
 in the computer room (I’ve done this before, was great). With your help
 of alcohol (sic) I will be able to become an even hornier student!'

The website's creator, Tom Thurlow, said: 'As soon as I saw Elina’s entry I knew we had a particularly 
wild girl on our hands.'

'I love the fact she uses her position
 in the computer science club to have sex in the computer room.

'She even
 told me how the computer science club is perfect because it’s full of 
guys.

'After meeting with Elina personally I 
am 100 per cent confident I have found the horniest student in the 
country - I have never met someone so sexually confident.'

The competition was slammed by sexual health experts as 'dangerous' though Shagatuni.com encourages students to have safe sex

The student, who claims to have had sex with just two people before going to university, claimed some of her proudest moments were sleeping with two of the university union's bartenders and stripping to the Baywatch theme song while in a local nightclub.

The final year student is planning on applying for internships in the hope to start up her own technology business.

A spokesman for The University of Exeter told Mail Online: 'We certainly don’t condone this sort of behaviour but our main concern at this time is for the student and the impact this may have on her over the long term.'

Though the University chose not to respond to Miss Desaine's claim to have had sex in an on-campus computer room, their regulations relating to the use of technology facilities states: 'Personal or recreational use of the IT facilities may be subject to temporary or permanent suspension'.

She insists her only rule is to only have sex when using a condom, and claims a recent chlamydia test that her housemates forced her to take returned a negative result.

'It's great because you can have fun without getting any diseases'.

Sexual health experts condemned the competition as 'dangerous' as they believed it could encourage the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

Before the competition's winner was announced, sexual health consultant Dr Peter Greenhouse said: ‘The more people who try to win this award, the more dangerous things will be for their friends. It is far from a brilliant idea in public health terms.

'Most people who have sexual infections have no symptoms. They get these infections from people who don't know they have it. That is why there are so many infections around.’
