Liberal Democrats want to ban all conventional cars by 2040 and allow only electric and ultra-low emission vehicles on the roads.

Every diesel and petrol car would be scrapped by then or earlier if there are enough technological advances.

The extraordinary policy, contained in the Lib Dems’ ‘green manifesto’ launched this week, has the backing of senior figures including party president Tim Farron.

The plan to ban conventional cars comes even though party leader Nick Clegg uses a gas-guzzler himself

The manifesto also outlines plans to give councils support to introduce more congestion charging in towns and cities to encourage greater take-up of public transport.

The Deputy Prime Minister and David Cameron both use cars –  usually a Jaguar or a BMW – from Scotland Yard, with a link to the control room, to ferry them to engagements.

In an earlier Lib Dem policy paper – Green Growth and Green Jobs – MPs and activists said: ‘Liberal Democrats would specify that by 2040, only ultra-low carbon vehicles will be permitted on UK roads for non-freight purposes. If technology permitted, we would bring forward this date.’

Street lights would also be dimmed where appropriate to cut down on energy use.

Other controversial policies in the manifesto launched on Monday include a pay as you throw bin tax called a ‘variable waste charge for households’.

The party also opposes any plans for additional runways at Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted and is against a new Thames Estuary airport touted by London Mayor Boris Johnson.

A Lib Dem spokesman said the green manifesto was a submission for consideration by the overall party. On the car ban, he added: ‘The companies need the incentive to change.

'It is not beyond reasonable ambition to suggest the industry can adapt to a zero-emission target within the next 25 years.’

But Paul Watters, head of public affairs for the AA, said: ‘You can’t suddenly turn the clock off between 2039 and 2040. It needs to be a longer time frame.’

An RAC spokesman said: ‘This will be pretty unfair for a lot of motorists who invest in cars with the intention of keeping them for a long time.’
