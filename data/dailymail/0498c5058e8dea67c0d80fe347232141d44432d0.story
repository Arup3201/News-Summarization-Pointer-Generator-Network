The Co-op was plunged into fresh chaos yesterday as its chairman fell on his sword for appointing crack addict Reverend Paul Flowers to head the group’s bank.

Len Wardle’s resignation came as anger is growing among ordinary investors whose retirement incomes are being raided to prop up the disaster-prone bank.

He admitted ‘serious questions’ were raised by the drugs scandal over former banking chairman Paul Flowers.

Cooperative Group chairman Len Wardle has resigned with immediate effect after questions were raised about how Paul Flowers, who has been caught buying crystal meth and cocaine, was put in charge of its bank

Mr Flowers, a former Labour councillor and Methodist minister who
 was chairman of the Co-operative Bank when it ran into trouble, faces an investigation by the police after being covertly filmed 
counting off £20 notes to buy hard drugs.

He was covertly filmed buying crystal meth and crack cocaine.

It also emerged today it emerged he has a conviction for gross indecency and quit as a councillor for having pornography on his computer.

The Co-operative Group yesterday launched a fact-finding investigation into 
'any inappropriate behaviour' at the group or the Co-operative Bank and a
 'root-and-branch review' of the structure of the organisation.

Ed Balls has come under pressure to return a £50,000 donation backed by the former Co-operative Bank chairman hit by claims of hard drug use.

Labour's leadership has attempted to distance itself from Paul Flowers, a former councillor, after it emerged he attended a private meeting with Ed Miliband and both men were also present at two dinners in Westminster.

Sources insisted he was 'neither influential nor important'.

Yesterday the 63-year-old was suspended from the party for bringing it into disrepute following footage that appears to show him buying drugs days after being grilled by the Treasury Select Committee over the bank's disastrous performance.

A Labour source: 'It's true that there was a private meeting with Ed in March of this year. There were two informal dinners - three meetings that we can find records of in the space of three years.

Earlier this month Mr Flowers told the Commons Treasury committee said: 'My recollection is that we paid for a particular researcher to assist the shadow chancellor in the work that he needed to do, and that we believed to be a legitimate and proper use of resources.'

Tory MP Brooks Newmark told the Daily Telegraph: 'The Rev Flowers' judgment was clearly impaired if he was prepared to give Ed Balls £50,000.

'Mr Balls should now ask himself whether it is right to accept that money, and consider giving it back.'

There is growing incredulity that a man with no banking experience and a penchant for crystal meth and cocaine had been made chairman of a bank.

But today Mr Wardle announced he will quit the £145,000 position he has held since 2007.

He was due to leave next May but he said it was now right for him to go straight away, having led the board that appointed Mr Flowers.

Mr Wardle said: ‘The recent 
revelations about the behaviour of Paul Flowers, the former chair of the
 Co-operative Bank, have raised a number of serious questions for both 
the bank and the group.

‘I 
led the board that appointed Paul Flowers to lead the bank board and 
under those circumstances I feel that it is right that I step down now, 
ahead of my planned retirement in May next year.

‘I
 have already made it clear that I believe the time is right for real 
change in our operations and our governance and the board recently 
started a detailed review of our democracy.

‘I
 hope that the group now takes the chance to put in place a new 
democratic structure so we can modernise in the interests of all our 
members.’

Critics have 
questioned how he could have been appointed given his apparent lack of 
experience, and Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee,
 said that, even before the weekend’s revelations, it was clear he was 
‘manifestly unsuitable’.

The Co-operative Bank is facing a 
rescue plan which will see majority control turned over to investors 
including US hedge funds, after it was left with a £1.5 billion gap in 
its finances following the takeover of the Britannia Building Society in
 2009.

Mr Flowers, a former 
Bradford councillor, now faces a police investigation. He has apologised
 over the scandal and been suspended by the Methodist Church as well as 
the Labour Party.

Mr Wardle’s departure will see him replaced by his deputy, Ursula Lidbetter, chief executive of the Lincolnshire Co-operative.

The
 Co-operative Group said: ‘It is intended that Ursula will chair the 
group through the current governance review, which will include 
consideration of how the board is constituted and chaired.’

MPs have castigated financial watchdogs for 
rubber-stamping the appointment of Rev Paul Flowers, which they 
denounced as a farcical ‘box-ticking exercise’.

Caught on camera: The Rev Paul Flowers was filmed counting money for a drugs deal

Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons
 Treasury Select Committee, said it was obvious when Flowers appeared 
before them earlier this month that he was ‘manifestly unsuitable’ to be
 a bank chairman.

He called for the regulation of senior bankers to be tightened to include continuing and ‘intrusive’ supervision.

‘It’s been a complete disaster. Nothing less than saying that will do,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s World At One.

He
 attacked the ‘approved persons regime’, whereby a City panel supposedly
 checked the competence of Rev Flowers, as ‘nothing more than a massive 
bureaucratic, back-covering, box-ticking exercise that satisfied 
regulators but did little or nothing to protect shareholders or 
customers of banks’.

Ursula Lidbetter replaces Mr Wardle in running the troubled Co-op Group

In fact Flowers was only 
checked by the regulator when he became a member of the Co-op board and 
was not re-interviewed at all when he was promoted to chairman in April 
2010.

Flowers quit his 
post in June this year as his ‘ethical’ bank was driven to the brink of 
collapse, threatening the retirement incomes of thousands of pensioners.

Yesterday he was also suspended by the Labour Party amid embarrassment over a £50,000 donation to Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls.

He
 faces a police inquiry into his use of hard drugs, and the Co-op 
announced a ‘root and branch review’ into ‘any inappropriate behaviour’ 
during the tenure of its former boss. 

Mr Wardle will be replaced by his deputy, Ursula Lidbetter, chief executive of the Lincolnshire Co-operative.

She told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'The stories (about Mr Flowers) are shocking but it's not something that I can comment on today. There are investigations going on, it is in the hands of police.

'Len had already told the membership that he was going to stand down next May and in light of the review of governance, which Len started, he felt that making a fresh start with a new chairman would be the best way forward.

'We have to devise a governance for the Co-operative Group which is fit for the future, for the scale and complexity of the organisation. It's an amalgamation of many, many organisations over its 150-year history, and we realise that it needs to change, it needs to be simpler, and that will mean changing many things.

The one thing we do want to make sure is that members still have a voice at the heart of the Co-operative Group. There are seven million members and we think their voice should be heard loud and clear, but we are open-minded about how we achieve that.

'The review will look at absolutely everything - it will look at what went wrong, it will look at the opportunities and we will devise a governance structure that is fit for the future, involves our members and makes sure we are very efficient and highly effective in the future.'

Raid: Police have searched the home of Reverend Paul Flowers after he was filmed apparently buying hard drugs

The sordid past of disgraced Co-op 
bank boss Reverend Paul Flowers was laid bare today after it emerged he 
has a conviction for gross indecency and quit as a councillor for having
 pornography on his computer.

The fallen Methodist minister is already 
being investigated by the police after apparently buying hard drugs, 
including crack cocaine and crystal meth.

But it has now been revealed that in the past 30 years he has been involved in a series of sex scandals.

In
 1981 he was convicted of gross indecency after he was caught by police 
performing a sex act with a trucker in a public toilet - but he was 
forgiven by the church.

Rev 
Flowers, who is gay, admitted the offence at Fareham Magistrates' Court 
in Hampshire and was fined £75 with £35 legal costs, yet his church let 
him continue in his job because he was sorry.

He
 also resigned as a Labour councillor in Bradford in 2011 after 
'inappropriate but not illegal adult content' was found on a computer he
 used, the city council said today.

A
 rent boy claimed today that the Methodist also used his Co-op email 
account to organise drug-fuelled sex sessions with and others while he 
was still chairman of the bank.

After
 his gross indecency conviction, Flowers told magistrates he was 'shamed
 and embarrassed' about the incident, but maintained he was involved 'at
 the other man's 
instigation'.

Yet he was allowed to continue as a Methodist minister.

'This
 was a matter for our usual procedures and after that process was 
complete it was decided he could continue as a minister,' a Methodist 
Ministry spokesman said.

'This matter did not preclude him from his activities in the church. He was very contrite, and he continued his work.'

A spokesman for Bradford Council said: 'Paul Flowers left Bradford Council in September 2011.

'Inappropriate but not illegal adult content was found on a Council computer handed in by Councillor Flowers for servicing. This was put to him and he resigned immediately.'
