You have to admire Brendan Rodgers. Not only is he facing the challenge of trying to improve Liverpool without Luis Suarez, he has set himself another challenge by signing Mario Balotelli.

The Italy forward is at times brilliant, and other times impossible. One thing is for certain so far in his career though: there is a consistent pattern to Balotelli’s behaviour - when things are going well, he’ll be fine. If times are difficult, he could be a liability.

His best spell at City came during a run in 2011 when they were on a nine-game winning streak which included their 6-1 victory at Old Trafford. Balotelli scored six goals in five games in that period.

Liability? Mario Balotelli, seen here watching Liverpool's match at his former club Manchester City on Monday, poses a unique set of challenges for Brendan Rodgers

Back in England: Balotelli has joined Liverpool from Milan for £16m 

Unpredictable: Balotelli can be fantastic and frustrating in equal measure. He is pictured showing off his famous 'Why Always Me?' t-shirt in Manchester City's 6-1 win at Man United in 2011

But later that season, when Mancini needed his prodigal son to deliver at Arsenal, City lost 1-0, fell eight points off the pace at the top, and Balotelli committed two horrible challenges to get himself sent off. Mancini was a sad sorry sight trying to persuade his striker to leave the field when he was reluctant to go.

With Balotelli suspended, City went on a winning run to seal the title. And with things going so well, of course, the Italian was happy to help out, laying on that sensational winning goal from Sergio Aguero against QPR in injury time – Balotelli’s only assist during his time with City. It was the only time he featured during that winning streak.

Mario’s a player who let Mancini down badly, and the former Man City boss was Balotelli’s father figure, the manager who trusted him and supported him more than any other. If Mario is prepared to do that to his father-figure, then good luck Brendan.

A bad challenge on a team-mate at the City training ground led to Mancini and Balotelli having a scuffle in front of photographers, and the player was sold a month later. 

Witnesses described the challenge as 'horrific' and 'seemingly pre-meditated.' It wasn’t the first time he had clashed with a colleague at the training ground.

Flashpoint: Balotelli clashed with 'father-figure' Roberto Mancini on the training ground back in January 2013

Red mist: Balotelli is shown a red card by referee Martin Atkinson during a match with Arsenal in April 2012

Work cut out: Brendan Rodgers could have a difficult task in keeping Balotelli on the straight and narrow 

Red cards and bans at City were too frequent. Reckless challenges on Dynamo Kiev’s Goran Popov in the Champions League, West Brom’s Youssouf Mulumbu and Arsenal’s Alex Song in the Premier League. Oh, and he got a four-match ban for stamping on Scott Parker’s head.

Maybe Mario has changed but there is no evidence of that. AC Milan had grown tired of the problems he created – he was banned for three games for insulting an opponent and a referee AFTER the final whistle when Milan were beaten by Napoli.

And towards the end of last season, Balotelli clashed with journalists and turned himself into a victim who claimed he was being attacked by half of Italy. This is the kind of nonsense that can affect a player’s game, and certainly affects Balotelli.

Inconsistency in his behaviour and performance (I’m not even talking about controversy away from football) is Balotelli’s trademark. At Euro 2012 he looked sensational; when Italy were knocked out of the World Cup this summer he was booked for dissent and substituted at half time.

Ripped: And celebrates in his own inimitable style

Sub-par: But Balotelli was unable to repeat that form at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil

Balotelli could be a reformed character. Rodgers might be the manager Mario has been searching for. Neither of those things are certain though, so that’s why the signing is a risk.

People have told me there is no downside to the Balotelli signing. Really?

Sounds like people trying to convince themselves it’s a great bit of business. What if he decides to launch another 'horrific' challenge in training on a team-mate? Or if he feels the urge to throw a dart at a youth team player as he did at City?

What if he is still one of the worst trainers football has ever seen – what kind of example does that set to some of the youngsters currently working hard for Rodgers? It could all mean a lot of time spent on managing one individual player, when I’m sure Rodgers could spend that time more profitably doing other things.

Based on his career so far, Balotelli will be a great signing – but only when things are going well. He’s got it all to prove.

From what we saw from him at Man City, how do you think he would have reacted had he been part of the Liverpool team that were well beaten in the end at the Etihad on Monday night?

For Liverpool’s sake, I hope Balotelli has grown up. If he hasn’t, it could be a big blemish on Rodgers’ so far excellent CV.
