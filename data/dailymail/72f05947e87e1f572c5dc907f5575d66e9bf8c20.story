Floyd Maywaether Jnr is ready to capitalise on Manny Pacquiao's weaknesses when the pair step into the ring for their $300m showdown in Las Vegas on May 2.

The undefeated American described Pacquiao as a 'solid' but 'reckless' fighter, who makes a lot of mistakes and insists he will be ready to take advantage at the MGM Grand.

Mayweather has often been labelled as a boring and he relies on his defnsive skill to outbox opponents rather than come out on the front foot and he says he will try to nullify the threat of Pacquiao.

'A lot of guys do a lot of things wrong, but they are still successful,' Mayweather is qouted as saying on mlive.com. 'So I want to know what he [Pacquiao] does right, so I can take that away from him, so I can take that arsenal away from him.

'What I do, when I'm facing a guy, whatever he does good, I take that away from him, so he has to resort to doing something different.' 

'I just want to look good for myself. I want to look very impressive. I'm pretty sure he's going to bring his A-game, and it's all about excitement.

I got here somehow, some way. He's a solid competitor, but very reckless, and he makes a lot of mistakes,' Mayweather continued.

'But he's been successful. Remember what I said – you've got guys that make a lot of mistakes but still are successful.'
