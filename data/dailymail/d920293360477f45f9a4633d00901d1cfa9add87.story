House prices have shot up 7.3 per cent since this time last year, new figures have revealed.

The value of the average property - which has increased by 1.1 per cent in the last month alone - now stands at £175,546, according to Halifax.

The bank said that the pace of increase has picked up since December, when prices fell by 0.5 per cent.

Hike: Today's figures show that house prices continue to shoot up

Prices in the three months to January 
were 1.9 per cent higher than in the preceding quarter, which the bank's monthly report said is in line with recent increases.

The steady increase in house prices comes as the Government's Help to Buy scheme has fuelled demand by allowing those with small deposits to join the property ladder.

Under the programme, the state will back loans made to buy homes worth up to £600,000 with just a 5 per cent deposit.

However, critics have said that stoking the property market in this way could lead to a price crash by creating a housing bubble.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said in December that the Coalition 'need to look again' at the policy, which he said was 'conceived in very different circumstances' to the growing housing market shown in figures today.

Dr Cable specifically expressed concern over the difference between the 'raging housing boom in London and the South East' which was not reflected elsewhere.

He brought up a statement by credit rating agency Standard and Poor's which he said was 'expressing very serious worries', which Dr Cable seemed to share.

However, David Cameron hit back at the criticism of the flagship scheme last month, pointing out that house prices are still far from their 2007 peak and that there was 'no evidence of a problem'.

He said: 'Where we are today, house prices are still way below the peak they reached in 2007.

'Forecasters do not think they will get back to the level before the crash even in 2019. So there is no evidence of a problem.

'Nationally, excluding London and the south-east, house prices are up just 3% over the last year.

'I think there are some people who are rather London-centric about this. This is about helping people to achieve the security and stability they want of owning a flat or a home of their own.'

In response to today's figures Martin Ellis, a housing economist for Halifax, said the continued squeeze on household finances as wages fail to keep up with the pace of inflation is 'expected to remain a constraint on the rate of growth of house prices'.

Halifax said that despite people's finances continuing to be constrained, the scarcity of homes will continue to push up prices.

According to recent findings from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the increased number of owners looking to sell at the end of 2013 is still too few to meet surging demand.

Mr Ellis continued: 'With the supply of properties being slow to respond to more buoyant market conditions, stronger demand has resulted in continued upward pressure on house prices.

'Demand has increased against a background of low interest rates and higher consumer confidence underpinned by signs that the economy is recovering and unemployment falling faster than expected.'

Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: 'We are still very much in recovery mode and it's unlikely that the Bank of England will risk raising interest rates too soon.

'Borrowers need to plan ahead, however, and ensure they can cope with rate rises when they do come.'

Mr Harris said estate agents and mortgage brokers have got off to 'an incredibly busy start' in 2014.

He said: 'Many buyers view this as the year when they will finally get on the housing ladder, or move up it - as long as they can find the right property.'
