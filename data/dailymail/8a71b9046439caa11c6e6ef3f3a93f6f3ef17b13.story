'Stabbing': Jacqueline Warren, 52, was rushed to hospital after apparently being stabbed in her home

An 80-year-old man has been charged with the attempted murder by police investigating the stabbing of his daughter who had spent two years researching their family tree.

Harry Warren was arrested after mother-of-four Jacqueline Warren, 52, was knifed several times at the house they shared in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.

Ms Warren, a former barmaid was airlifted to Wythenshawe Hospital by air ambulance and underwent emergency treatment for stab injuries. She is said to be in a serious but stable condition.

The incident at breakfast time on Monday occurred just 48 hours after divorcee Jacqui, who had lived in the area for 20 years, posted messages on Facebook proudly talking of her work on her family tree.

During her research she had managed to reunite long lost relatives including a mother who had given up her daughter for adoption and a father and child who had not seen each other for ten years.

It is believed Jacqui's father moved in with her around six months ago after struggling with his advancing age. Today Warren was due to appear before Rochdale Magistrates' Court after being questioned by detectives.

One neighbour said: 'It's such a shock. Jacqui's a lovely neighbour who would do anything for anybody and she absolutely adores her family.

'She even helped me out a few times with household chores. Her father is as quiet as a mouse and we barely saw him.

'We believe he he had been struggling with advancing age and she was just helping him out. He'd only been living there about six months. We're just hoping and praying Jacqui will pull through. She is a genuinely good and caring person.'

Another said: 'I was speaking to Jacqui's daughter who said she was seriously ill but the family think she'll a be alright. The first I knew about it was when I heard the helicopter. It was right over the house.

'Attack': Police were called to this home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, after reports that a woman had been stabbed

'They were trying to land on the green opposite but they couldn't because of the trees and overhead lines and had to land on a nearby road. The police cordoned off drive and put up a scenes of crime tent. There must have been six or seven police cars outside.'

Jacqui has two daughters and two sons and is believed to have grandchildren herself. She had been looking forward to becoming a godparent to a newborn baby.

In a message on Facebook on January 4 she said: 'I'm so glad that I can bring some joy and happiness into people's lives.

'I've found someone's mother as she was adopted at birth and they were both overjoyed to be reunited and I've just found someone's daughter he's not seen for 10 years.

'Happy days spring to mind. I've been doing my family tree for about two years now so if i can help anyone feel free to message me.'

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said they were called to the property shortly after 8.30am on Monday morning.

They said they found a woman at the scene with a 'number of stab wounds'. The victim's father was taken into custody.

Detective Inspector Melani Linton of Greater Manchester Police said: 'People are bound to be extremely shocked when they hear news of this incident, but I would like to try and reassure them as much as I can.

'We have a team of detectives investigating what exactly has happened here. This was an isolated incident and we do not believe there was any threat to the wider community.'
