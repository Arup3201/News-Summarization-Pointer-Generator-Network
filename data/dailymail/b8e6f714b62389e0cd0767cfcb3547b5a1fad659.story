Somewhere in the shallows of the River Dee, it probably dawned on him he was lost.

The water didn’t taste quite so salty as it did a while ago and the fish he was chasing looked distinctly unfamiliar.

So what was a maverick dolphin expected to do but leap out of the water and take a look around?

Rare sight: This dolphin was spotted swimming up the river Dee in North Wales on Monday

Hungry: The young dolphin has swum 30 miles chasing fish up the river to within half a mile of the city centre

Ah yes. Here we are. Chester 
racecourse, about half a mile from the city centre and 20 miles from the
open sea. Not quite the kind of place you’d expect to see a 
short-beaked common dolphin, perhaps – even one that’s decided to take a
city break.

But just for 
the moment, Dave the River Dee dolphin clearly likes it here on the 
border between England and Wales, entertaining spectators with leaping, 
clicking and flipping and displays just yards from a riverside walkway 
and cycle track.

Startled 
passers-by tweeted photographs of the show-off performance when Dave was
first spotted on Monday evening just west of the Welsh border, which 
runs north to south across the river.

He
stayed overnight and was seen again at various points on Tuesday, at 
one stage reaching a weir that is in sight of the ancient city walls.

Yesterday – after apparently heading out towards the Irish Sea – he was  back again.

‘I
don’t think it can decide whether to stay in England or Wales,’ said 
Stephen Marsh, operations director for the British Divers Marine Life 
Rescue charity, which is monitoring Dave’s travels.

‘We want to make sure it doesn’t get into trouble or become stranded on a bank, but at the moment it seems quite happy.

‘Unless it gets into difficulty we don’t need to intervene.’

The Dee Rivermonster: The dolphin has already earned himself several nicknames since he was first spotted

Dave,
whose more normal habitat is the deep water of the Bay of Biscay or 
Irish Sea, is believed to have broken away from a pod to chase or search
for fish to eat.

It 
appears he swam into  the mouth of the Dee estuary from Liverpool Bay, 
then into the comparatively narrow stretch of river that runs between 
Chester and Connah’s Quay.

Onlookers
saw him frolicking  in the tidal waters and heard his distinctive 
‘clicking’ noise as he swam near the weir and leapt into the air.

‘Nobody
really knows for certain why they do that,’ Mr Marsh said. ‘He might 
have been having a quick look round to see where he was, maybe looking 
for his family or his prey … or sometimes it might just be a jump for 
joy.’

Experts suspect low 
tide might have taken Dave by surprise –  and that the current high 
spring tide, which dramatically increases the river’s current, probably 
prevented him from heading back out to sea.

Watchful eye: A conservation group is keeping tabs on the dolphin to make sure it does not come to any harm

Rescue: Despite efforts to save the Langstone bottlenose, it had to be put down

In 2006 a Northern Bottlenose whale captured the hearts of the British public and made headlines around the world when it swam up the River Thames in the depths of winter.

Scientists believed the six-metre long female had got lost and was trying to head west towards the deep waters of the north Atlantic when it became stranded.

She had not been able to feed for three days after swimming into the river and became severely dehydrated.

Despite a rescue operation, the sea mammal, a young adult, died as she was being taken back out to sea on a barge.

In 2008 an eight-metre whale weighing nine stone beached itself on a mudflat in Langstone Harbour, Hampshire.

The whale, which was also a Northern Bottlenose, was put down by lethal injection after suffering kidney failure.

Yesterday a study conducted by the Zoological Society of London announced 708 seals had been spotted in the Thames Estuary in the first ever count by air, sea and land in which numerous volunteers and conservationists took part.

Although it is positive news for the south of the England, in Scotland numbers of the harbour seal have declined sharply for unknown reasons.

Although
common dolphins  can swim at more than 35mph  and can maintain high 
speeds  for hours, they are deep water mammals and are unused to such 
powerful fluctuations.

Short-beaked
common dolphins can weigh 440lb and grow up to  9ft long. Most live an 
average of 17 years but some have reportedly survived to 50.

It
is likely Dave will find a way out (or that he simply decides to cancel
his holiday) but coastguards have put a lifeboat on standby to aid his 
passage.

Should he become stranded, boat crews and animal welfare teams will hoist him from the water and return him to the deep.

Last
night a watch was being maintained to ensure he didn’t leap the weir 
and head farther upriver – although he might  struggle a bit if he got 
as far  as its source in Snowdonia, someone observed.

Conservation 
worker Tom McGovern, who has helped a long-running clean-up initiative 
for the river, said: ‘Over the past three or four years we have got rid 
of over a thousand sacks of rubbish.

‘It’s a good job we’ve done  that, or he would have been swimming around with a plastic bag on his head!’

Playful: The dolphin has seemed quite undeterred by his unfamiliar surroundings
