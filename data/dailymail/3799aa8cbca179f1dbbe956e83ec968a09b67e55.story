Indicted: Terrence Cody of the Baltimore Ravens, has been indicted on 15 animal cruelty charges

Terrence Cody, a nose tackle for the Baltimore Ravens, has been indicted on numerous animal cruelty charges and released from the team on the same day.

Cody, 26, who has been in the NFL for five years, is facing 15 charges including two counts of aggravated animal cruelty with a dog, five counts of animal abuse or neglect with the same dog and one count of illegal possession of an alligator, according to Deputy State’s Attorney John Cox.

The felony aggravated animal cruelty charges, which stem from the death of his Presa Canario Mastiff, carry a maximum sentence of three years and $5,000 fine.

Cody was also charged with one count of possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia and one count of possession of marijuana.

Baltimore County police said Cody, who turned himself in, was released on $10,000 bail.

Peter Schaffer, Cody’s agent, told the Baltimore Sun that the player had taken the dog to see a vet for treatment but the dog subsequently died. Cody maintains his innocence on the dog charges.

‘This is all a result of the NFL allowing players to be convicted before they’re tried,’ Mr Schaffer said. ‘If Terrence wasn’t a public figure, they wouldn’t have ever charged him. It’s just ridiculous.

‘If he was treating the dog so poorly, why would he take it to the veterinarian? They are trying to say he wanted the dog dead, which makes no sense because he loved the dog.’

Mr Schaffer added: ‘He’s done nothing wrong. This could potentially affect his career adversely, and I’m not going to let it happen. This is a quality young man who’s a true animal lover. He wouldn’t hurt a fly, let alone a dog.’

Cut: Cody was drafted by the Ravens in 2010, but was released on Monday after only playing once this year

Two counts of aggravated animal cruelty involving a dog described as a Presa Canario Mastiff. Those are both felonies and carry a maximum incarceration of three years.

Five counts of animal abuse or neglect involving the same dog.

One count of illegal possession of an alligator.

Five counts of animal abuse or neglect involving the alligator.

One count of possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia.

One count of possession of marijuana.

 

Cody is not under suspicion of dog fighting. Michael Vick, the quarterback who currently plays for the New York jets, served 21 months in prison after pleading guilty to dog fighting charges in 2007.

Cody was scheduled to be released on Monday, the earliest that NFL teams can terminate contracts – the day after the Super Bowl.

The Ravens had indicated that they were going to release him a couple of weeks ago. Cody was due to become an unrestricted free agent in March.

The University of Alabama alumnus was selected in the second round of the 2010 NFL draft. This season, however, he was only active for one game.

John Harbaugh, the Ravens coach, said at the end of the season that the ‘threshold of tolerance’ had changed after five players were arrested last year.
