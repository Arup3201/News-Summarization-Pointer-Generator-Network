A senior fireman has been arrested for hitting four boys with a golf club after they threw candy at his son on Halloween, police say.

Captain Carl Holmberg was trick-or-treating in Revere, Boston, on Friday with his wife and six-year-old when the group aged 11 to 17 confronted them.

According to his charge sheet, the captain of 15 years reacted by attacking the children.

Charged: Captain Carl Holmberg has been charged with assault for allegedly hitting four boys with a golf club on Halloween after they are said to have threatened him and his six-year-old son with fake weapons and candy

Two were hospitalized and an 11-year-old boy as left with welts on his head.

Holmberg is charged with threee counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and one count of assaulting a child, MyFoxBoston.com reports.

His wife Serena Holmberg tearfully told WCVB through her letterbox that he was defending himself in the incident at 7.30pm.

One of the group had a fake machete that looked real, she said.

'About eight or 10 kids came and started throwing things at him, and then they left and came back with more kids, and then they stood there and taunted us and told him they were going to [mess] him up,'

'Defending himself': Holmberg's niece said he was defending himself from the 'dangerous' group of boys

Angry: The father of the 11-year-old boy left with welts on his head said they were not threatening the captain 

'I'm horrified. I can't even talk. It was scary. My six-year-old is horrified; he won't come home,' she said.

'My husband is an awesome person; he would do anything for anybody. He's a firefighter; that's what he does. He helps people. He was protecting his six-year-old and his wife.'

However, the father of the 11-year-old boy who suffered injuries to his head claimed they were trick-or-treating and nobody threatened the family of three.

Holmberg has been placed on paid leave awaiting arraignment today.
