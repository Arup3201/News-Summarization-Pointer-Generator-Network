Arsene Wenger insists Alexis Sanchez ‘looks alright’ despite being pictured with an ice pack on his ankle after Arsenal’s 4-1 victory against Galatasaray. 

The Chilean forward was hurt in a challenge with midfielder Felipe Melo, who only picked up a booking for his late lunge. But Wenger said that Sanchez should be fine for the game against Chelsea this weekend, while Jack Wilshere is also ready for 90 minutes. 

Wilshere came on for the Gunners and was struggling with a similar injury to Sanchez before the game. Sanchez was brought off for tactical reasons according to Wenger, who said Melo could have been sent off.

 ‘It could have been a red. I’ll have to see it again,’ Wenger said after the game. 

‘It looked from where I was that it was a red. 

‘I took Alexis off to be a bit more solid defensively once we were down to 10 men. Unfortunately, in my life I haven’t met many players who are happy to come off.’ 

Arsenal won courtesy of a Danny Welbeck hat-trick and another from Sanchez.
