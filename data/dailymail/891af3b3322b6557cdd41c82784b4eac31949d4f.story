Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has sent out a clear message of support to Gareth Bale and told supporters to expect him back in the team for the visit of Liverpool in a week's time.

Bale has missed Real's last two games and with the side giving their best performances of the season so far without him, there have been calls for Ancelotti to stick with a midfield quartet of Isco, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez.

But the Real boss said: 'People seem to have forgotten who it was that scored the winning goal in the Spanish Cup final last season and who it was who scored in the Champions League final.

'He (Bale) is recuperating well and we will see how he is at the weekend, and if not for Saturday then for the game against Liverpool.'

Isco is a fans' favourite but spent most of last season watching from the bench as Bale's second half of the season made him one of Real's most important players. 

Ancelotti said last week that when the £86million man is fit then he will be in the side.

That upset some supporters still on a high after Real demolished Liverpool and Barcelona in the space of five days with Isco at the heart of two stunning team performances.

But Ancelotti knows Bale's worth and sent a clear message of support to him as his team prepares for Tuesday night's Copa del Rey game against third-tier side Cornella.

Bale has a gluteus muscle strain and has not played since the last international break. There are suggestions he was even considered for the weekend Clasico but that both the club and the player opted to wait another week before his return.
