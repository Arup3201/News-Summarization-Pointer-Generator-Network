Slot machine raiders recruited two glamorous young women to distract workers at a nightclub while they made off with more than £1,000 in coins, a court heard.

Danielle Mason and Nicole White, both 20, befuddled staff while the looters secretly emptied a 'Cops and Robbers' and a 'Deal or No Deal' gaming machines.

The gang were found to have a stash of more than £1,120 in coins when police stopped their getaway car.

A special key needed to access the slot machines was also found hidden in Mason's leggings.

The three men, who enlisted the young women, had more than 100 convictions between them for stealing from gaming machines, Burnley Crown Court was told.

A judge jailed ringleader Jamie Finney, 28, for eight months, whilst Anthony Wainwright, 40, who was in breach of a suspended jail term for possessing a knuckleduster, was given ten months. 

Amateur footballer Barry Cantley, 22, was jailed for two months.

Shop assistant Mason and single mother White were each given 12 month conditional discharges after a judge said they were on the 'periphery' of the raids. 

All five admitted theft and attempted theft as they appeared at the Crown Court.

Single mother Nicole White, 20, had no previous convictions, the court was told

Shop assistant Danielle Mason, 20, also had no previous convictions

Prosecutor Stephen Parker told the hearing the group raid was planned and tools and a car were used to commit the offences, which happened just after 9pm on November 2 last year.

The duty manager saw the gang playing on the bandit machines upstairs. 

He watched them for some time on the CCTV and thought they were acting suspiciously.

 The Deal or No Deal machine showed it was getting ready to be emptied or pay out. He went to speak to the group and asked them what they were doing.

Mr Parker said Wainwright claimed he had put £1 in the machine and it wouldn't go down the slot and he had shaken the machine and switched it off.

Fearing that they had been rumbled the gang then fled the premises and left the duty manager to inspect the machines and discover they had been tampered with.

Police were called and town centre CCTV operators monitored the five as they made off and got into a car. 

They were stopped a short distance away by the police, who found a bag containing £1,122 in £1 coins in the vehicle. Finney had £500 on him.

It was said in Nicola White's defence that she it was 'bad judgement' on her part to take part

The prosecutor continued: 'Recovered from the leggings of Mason was a set of three keys, which, in the view of the engineer who inspected the gaming machines, had been adapted to fit these particular machines. Keys for them can only be obtained from certain locksmiths.

'He tried the keys recovered from Mason and they fitted both the devices, accessing both where the £1 coins and cash were kept. One of the machines had been emptied of all money, both cash and coins.'

The machine owners estimated it was likely to have had between £500 and £600 in it.

Police found the special key used to open the slot machines in Danielle Mason's leggings

Wainwright later told police he had been in Manchester with the others, had a good day, had won about £1,000 and they decided to call in Burnley on the way home. 

He did not accept any wrong-doing on his part and claimed he knew nothing about the keys used on the machines.

Finney claimed about £1,000 had been won in Salford and that he quickly hit the £70 jackpot at Hotshots, then doubled it to £140. 

It was said in the defence of shop assistant Mason that she was not aware this was a pre planned activity

When the machine didn't pay out, he switched it off. He claimed he had not tampered with any machine or used the key to try and open them.

White said Wainwright and Finney regularly won money on bandit machines and denied any wrongdoing. 

She told officers the coins were Wainwright's winnings. 

Father-of-two Finney had 60 previous offences on his record whilst Wainwright had clocked up 40 convictions. 

Mason's barrister said: 'She was offered a day out and due to her rather dismal circumstances, she agreed.'

Cantley had five offences on his record and had served a previous term of detention for theft from a machine.

Mason and White had no previous convictions. Police have now taken civil proceedings over the money recovered from the car.

In mitigation Nick Dearing, for Finney, said his client had an addiction to gambling and added: 'Rather than formal schooling, his education seems to have been attending at local amusement arcades and watching people playing on gaming machines. On good days, he will raise money, but on bad days, he will break into a machine and steal money from it.'

Representing Mason, Mr Dearing told the court: 'As far as she was concerned, this was not a pre-planned activity. She was offered a day out and due to her rather dismal circumstances, she agreed.'

Keith Harrison, for White, who is on benefits, said she had a young child and added: ' She was by no means the main player in all this. It was bad judgement on her behalf to go along with it.'

Passing sentence Judge Jonathan Gibson said: 'This was organised offending, particularly, it seems to me, on the parts of you, Mr Finney and Mr Wainwright, particularly given your previous convictions.'
