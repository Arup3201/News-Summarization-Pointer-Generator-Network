Accusations: Jhona Mathews, 33, has accused William McLaughlin of sexually assaulting and harassing her while they both worked at one of San Francisco's oldest Catholic shrines

Kinky sex in the sanctuary, embezzlement and racy photos are causing scandal at one of San Francisco's oldest Catholic churches.

The accusations flying out of the National Shrine of St. Francis of Assisi have led to the 'comprehensive investigation of alleged improper behavior' involving the shrine's volunteer chairman, William McLaughlin and admin- assistant, Jhona Mathews, 33 - costing them both their jobs.

According to shrine spokesman, Larry Kamer, a police report was filed last week alleging that Mathews had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from the church. Mathews, in turn, has filed a sexual harassment claim against the church, alleging that McLaughlin forced her to have sex with him inside the church's sanctuary.

'McLaughlin spanked her and forced her to engage in sexual intercourse with him' in order to keep her job, alleged Sandra Ribera, who is acting as Mathews's attorney.

'Paddling with a wooden paddle, getting spanked in the sacristy of the shrine of St. Francis, which Catholics know, it's just appalling to hear as a Catholic and having sexual intercourse in the shrine of St. Francis,' added Ribera.

McLaughlin, who is believed to be in his 60s and is a wealthy Marin County real-estate developer, acts as the chairman of the shrine's volunteer program.

Scandal: The National Shrine of St. Francis of Assisi conducted a 'comprehensive investigation of alleged improper behavior' involving the shrine's volunteer chairman, William McLaughlin and Jhona Mathews,

He briefly reached national prominence in 2005, when he arranged for a massive airlift of New Orleans pets that had been stranded by Hurricane Katrina.

According to Kamer, McLaughlin has been relieved of his duties following the scandal and Mathews has been fired.

Mathews first met McLaughlin when the carpet firm she was working for helped to renovate the residence of shrine that San Francisco's Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone shares with the archdiocese's vicar general.

Mathews was offered a job in February 2012 as an admin-assistant and Ribera alleges that her client was soon experiencing sexual harassment from McLaughlin.

Face-off: Sandra Ribera, who is acting as Mathews's attorney claims the abuse occurred inside the church while shrine spokesman, Larry Kamer, says that Jhona Mathews embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from the church

'She felt she had no choice,' Ribera said to the San Francisco Chronicle. 'He was dangling her livelihood over her head, and she had a daughter to feed.'

Jhona Mathews is a single mother in her early 30s with a 2-year-old child. She worked as an assistant to the church rector Father Harold Sinider. She says the president of the church board of trustees Bill McLaughlin forced her into having sex with him

Mathews allegedly broke off the affair in October and filed her police report after she was fired last week.

'McLaughlin spanked her and forced her to engage in sexual intercourse with him' in order to keep her job, Ribera said.

She also alleges that McLaughlin sent her sexy e-mails and photos - which she did not want or reciprocate.

Church officials are claiming that Mathews was fired after evidence was found that she had stolen up to 'six figures' from the church.

ABC7 News learned that early last week, the church filed a police report charging Mathews with embezzlement.  

Ribera categorically denies her client stole from the church.

The church has now launched an investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment.

ABC7 news tried to contact McLaughlin, the man Mathews says sexually abused her but he did not respond.
