Vern Cotter is determined to begin his BT Murrayfield reign with a bang — and believes unleashing the Gray brothers for the first time together in Scotland colours will go a long way to ensuring it.

As exclusively revealed by Sportsmail earlier this week, 20-year-old Jonny will join his older brother Richie, 25, in the second row of the team that takes on Argentina on Saturday.

They will become the 21st set of siblings to pull on a Scottish jersey in the same international match and the head coach insists they more than deserve their chance to face up to the Pumas.

‘We have got the two Gray brothers starting against Argentina and what a great occasion it will be for them and their family,’ said Cotter, whose first four matches in charge of Scotland were away from home.

‘Richie has been playing very well for Castres in France and Jonny has been working away as well at Glasgow Warriors, adding bits to his game over the last year or two, and he will call the line-outs. They are both very mobile, both very capable of picking the ball up and carrying it.

‘I have told them what a great occasion it will be to play a Test match with each other. It’s been done here at Murrayfield before but it’s great to see it happen again. They will be playing for each other and I’m looking forward to it.

Scotland coach Vern Cotter has named a youthful squad for his side's opening game at Murrayfield 

‘Being brothers may help them play together but the fact of the matter is that they have made it very easy for me to pick them together because they have been playing very well. That’s the key to their selection.’

As also revealed by Sportsmail, Cotter has given a first cap to Glasgow Warriors centre Mark Bennett and has brought in his club-mate Adam Ashe at No 8.

And the Kiwi has urged his young team — seven of the match-day 23 are 22 years old or under — to take the game to Argentina.

‘I’m looking to see them have a go as they’re really good players,’ said Cotter. ‘We’ll be focusing on creating line-breaks and scoring points from our attacks. “Take the ball up, having a good look in front of you and go for it” is what I have told them.

‘We’ve got a great surface here and we’ve got players who are really excited about playing on that. Hopefully we can get some speed into the game.

‘Also, I want to see my players enjoy their rugby and play for each other as best they can.

‘On a personal level, I’m absolutely excited about this game, which is my first at Murrayfield, and really looking forward to see the team run out for the match and to experience the atmosphere at my first home game.’

Cotter said he was confident that Bennett and Ashe, whose only cap came against South Africa in the summer, would be able to cope with playing in front a passionate home crowd and the fact there were so many of their Warriors team-mates in the starting XV would help them both.

‘Mark has been developing his performances week in, week out with Glasgow and has waited patiently for his chance,’ said the head coach, who has picked 10 Warriors in his starting line-up. 

‘You can see his determination and the way he breaks the line and scores tries for his club. I am confident he will do well for Scotland.

‘Adam gives us the ability to connect the play of forwards and backs and defensively he has really improved.

‘He likes hitting hard and he will be looking forward to this game to show his qualities.’
