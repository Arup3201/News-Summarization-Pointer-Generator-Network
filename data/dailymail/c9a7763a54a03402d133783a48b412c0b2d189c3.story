A female veteran found a nasty note  left on her car criticizing her for parking in a spot reserved for veterans outside of a grocery store in North Carolina.

Mary Claire Caine, who served in the Air Force and spent time stationed in Kuwait, found the note attached to the front passenger window of her SUV outside the Harris Teeter grocery store in Wilmington, North Carolina.

The note, written in sharpie, read: ‘Maybe [you] can’t read the sign you parked in front of. This space is reserved for those who fought for AMERICA… not you. Thanks, Wounded Vet.’

As a veteran Caine could not believe what she had read.

Mary Claire Caine (pictured) served in the Air Force for four years as an avionics technician at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. As a veteran she is entitled to use reserved parking spots at her local grocery store

She returned to her car after a routine trip to the Harris Teeter store in Wilmington, North Carolina, to find a note criticizing her use of the reserved veterans' parking spot signed simply 'Wounded Vet'

‘The first thing I felt was confusion that there was a mistake, and that I had to talk to this person and ask them why they were so quick to assume I wasn't a veteran and that I was taking privileges that didn't belong to me,’ she told WECT.

Her confusion turned to anger when she found herself questioning her eligibility to use the special parking spots, marked: ‘Reserved Veteran Parking’.

‘For a split second I thought, “Am I a worthy enough veteran to park in this spot?” And, then I got very angry at myself for even considering that.’

She waited by the car in the hope that the note’s author would return and she could set the record straight and correct their apparent hurtful conclusion that as a woman she was unlikely to be a veteran.

Caine waited by the car in the hope that the note's author would appear and she could confront them about the assumption that she was not a veteran. Unfortunately they did not return

‘I think they took one look at me when I got out of my car and saw that I was a woman and assumed I wasn't a veteran and assumed I hadn't served my country.’

‘They have this image of what today's American veteran is and honestly if you've served in the United States military, you know that veterans come in all shapes and sizes. I question whether the person who left the note was fully aware of that.’

Caine served from as an avionics technician at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, from 1996 to 2000, where she worked on the on the flight line of the F-117 Nighthawk.

She comes from a military family, her father was a Vietnam era Marine Corps officer, and both of her brothers also joined the marines. Caine enlisted in the Air Force at the age of 21. 

After a four-year tour she left the Air Force as a senior airman. Caine then moved to North Carolina, earned a college degree, and became a realtor.

Caine comes from a military family, having followed both her father and her brothers into service. 'Veterans come in all shapes and sizes. I question whether the person who left the note was fully aware of that' she said

Caine suspects that the note’s author partly jumped to the conclusion they did because her realtor contact details are prominently displayed on the back of the SUV she drives.

She also speculated that perhaps the person who wrote the note assumed the special parking spots were only for wounded veterans, even though the signs do not say that.

‘I want them to know they owe me and every other female service member who's fighting now and who's fought in the past, an apology for jumping to conclusions,’ Caine told WECT.

‘It's true what the soldiers missing in action slogan is: “All gave some and some gave all.” And, I think that's very important that sacrifice is sacrifice and I earned the title as a veteran and I'm proud of that.’

Caine speculates that the display of contact details for her current career as a realtor on the back of her car, pictured here outside the Harris Teeter grocery store where the incident occurred, may be partially to blame

Caine, does not always park in the veteran spots, and only makes a point of doing so when her 10-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter are with her, though on the day in question she was alone. Both of her children are proud of their mother for serving in the military.

Harris Teeter grocery chain spokesperson Danna Jones said in a statement: 'Harris Teeter shoppers write, call, tweet and post to us that they love these spaces, and we were disappointed to learn what occurred with Ms. Caine.'

'Our teams are in the process of reaching out to Ms. Caine, so we can offer her a token of our appreciation as well as thank her for her service and for shopping at Harris Teeter.'

Caine has said that she while appreciates people offering her gifts, she would prefer if people instead consider donating to the Wounded Warrior Project.
