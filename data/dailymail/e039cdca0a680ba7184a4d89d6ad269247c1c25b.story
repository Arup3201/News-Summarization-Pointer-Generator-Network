Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben struck twice as the champions annihilated promoted Paderborn 6-0 on Saturday to open up an 11-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga.

Poland international Lewandowski, who has yet to deliver the goal flush expected from him when he joined from rivals Borussia Dortmund this season, has not been an automatic starter.

Coach Pep Guardiola publicly backed the striker on Friday, saying he was not always playing merely because of different systems.

Goals: Lewandowski (2), Robben (2), Ribery, Weiser

Lewandowski, who was a late substitute in the goalless draw against Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League this week, paid back the trust when he plucked a superb flick from Robben to fire Bayern ahead in the 24th minute.

Then, in true centre forward fashion, he tapped in a Franck Ribery cutback 13 minutes later. Paderborn's fate was sealed when Florian Hartherz was sent off on the hour and Robben converted the penalty.

Ribery also got on the scoresheet along with Mitchell Weiser before Robben notched his 16th goal of the campaign to equal his best season tally at Bayern and climb to the top of the scorers list.

Bayern, who have scored 14 goals in their last two league games, are top of the Bundesliga on 55 points.
