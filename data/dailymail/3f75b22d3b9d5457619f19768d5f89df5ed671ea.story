It was a film that came to symbolise the second intifada as Palestinian-Israeli tensions exploded into war.

But iconic footage of a 12-year-old Palestinian boy being shot dead during a gunfight between Israeli and Palestinian soldiers has been branded a fake and a 'blood libel' - 13 years after it shocked the world.

A new Israeli report into Muhammad al Dura's death in the Gaza Strip claims the images may 
have been staged by France 2, the French television station that broke the story in 2000.

The claims, which will reignite tensions in an already highly-volatile region, have caused such outrage in Gaza that al Dura's father himself has offered to exhume his son's body so an international inspection can be carried out.

The pictures of Mohammed and Jamal al-Dura under fire in Gaza were shown around the world in 2000

The 55-second clip, that was seen by millions of television viewers across the world when it aired on September 30, 2000, showed al Dura clinging to his father, Jamal, behind a barrel as bullets flew around them.

The father is seen gesturing frantically to try to stop the shooting as the boy screams in terror.

The
camera then cuts to a shot of the motionless boy slumped in his 
father's lap. A French TV report blamed Israeli troops for killing the 
boy which Israel has long disputed.

Images
of al Dura taken from the film were reproduced on stamps, and on murals
painted across the Middle East; schools and streets were named
after him; and he became viewed as a martyr in Gaza.

The France 2 television network report, 
which aired days after the Palestinian uprising 
erupted, directly blamed al-Dura's death on Israeli forces.

But presenting the report yesterday, Israel's minister for strategic affairs Yuval Steinitz branded the programme 'utterly baseless' and a 'modern-day blood libel against the state of Israel.'

Bizarrely, the Israeli Defence Forces
(IDF) even admitted killing the boy by accident at first, but quickly backtracked claiming he was in fact slain by Palestinian friendly 
fire.

Israel later blamed the 'mistake' on the 'fog of war', claiming it was made before all the evidence was gathered.

Israel now says France 2's claim that Israeli forces killed the
boy is misleading, provides no evidence and is part of a smear campaign
against the Jewish state.

The 44-page report of
its investigation, ordered last year by Israel's current Defence 
Minister Moshe Yaalon, says it also 'served as an inspiration and 
justification for terrorism, antisemitism and the delegitimising of 
Israel'.

It said France 2 failed to broadcast 
peripheral footage, not aired in the original programme, in which the 
boy 'is seen to be alive' and 'moved his arm and turned his head', adding that there was no evidence the boy 
was shot by Israeli troops or that he was even killed at all.

Proof of this, it said, was that there were no blood marks on the scene or bullet wounds in the alleged 
victims.

'It is important to focus on this 
incident, which has slandered Israel's reputation,' Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a ceremony where the report was 
delivered to him, branding it a 'manifestation of of the ongoing, mendacious campaign to deligitimise Israel'.

The second Palestinian intifada or uprising broke out at the end of September 2000 and is named after the Jerusalem mosque complex where the violence began.Frustrations that years of the negotiation had failed to deliver a Palestinian state were intensified by the collapse of the Camp David summit in July 2000.Ariel Sharon, then the leader of Israel's opposition, paid a visit to the site in East Jerusalem known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, and to Jews as Temple Mount, which houses the al-Aqsa mosque - and frustration boiled over into violence.

In one of the enduring images of the conflict 12-year-old Muhammad Durrah is killed during a gunbattle between Israeli troops and Palestinians in the Gaza strip, kindling Palestinian anger about the growing number of children killed by Israeli forces.

The army initially apologises, but later casts doubt on whether its forces killed the boy.

The Sharm al-Sheikh agreement, brokered by President Clinton, aims to end the upsurge in violence. It breaks down almost immediately.

'This
is a manifestation of the ongoing mendacious campaign to delegitimize 
Israel. There is only one way to counter lies, and that is through the 
truth.'

No autopsy was conducted, and the Israeli investigation was based primarily on expert interviews and analysis of the raw film.

However, Israel have at no point been able to offer a suggestion as to Muhammad's current whereabouts.

The boy's father, Jamal al-Dura, on 
Monday said he is willing to have his son's body exhumed so a pathological examination can be carried out, including DNA testing to understand the true details of the boy's death.

'If
he is still alive, who was the one who was shot in my arms and killed?'
he asked. 'The entire world saw how my beloved son was killed.'

Upon the report's release, France 2 immediately rejected its claims, calling for an independent inquiry.

The programme's reporter Charles Enderline said he was happy to take a polygraph test and would even be willing to help Muhammad's father exhume the body to 'clarify the circumstances of the incident.'

Enderline added that Israeli investigators had at no point attempted to contact him or Mr al-Dura.

Israeli commentators who believe 
their country has been unfairly punished for the case nonetheless 
questioned the decision to conduct a new investigation, saying it was 
unlikely to sway already hardened opinions around the world.

'On one hand, it's better late than 
never. On the other, the damage has already been done,' wrote Ben-Dror 
Yemini, a columnist for the Maariv daily.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the incident had 'slandered Israel's reputation'

'No report, and certainly not a report commissioned by the Israeli government, is going to decrease the damage.

'We have already been defeated in the battle between lies and the truth. The lies won.'

Yossi Kuperwasser, the Israeli official who led the investigation, said it was imperative to set the record straight. 

'The
entire idea that Israel is a child killer ... is first and foremost 
based on the Mohammad al-Dura story,' he told The Associated Press.

It was said Mohammed died in the arms of his father after being caught in crossfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians. But Israel Israel has produced a new report to suggest there is no proof the boy died or even injured

Israel has long disputed the accusation the Mohammed al-Dura was killed by Israeli forces

'This case ... is still being used by people who are committing terror attacks against Israel. It still feeds the hatred.'

Despite claiming Muhammad was not 
killed and may not have even been injured, the report offers no 
suggestion of his whereabouts 13 years on.

According
to his father, Muhammad was killed on the spot by gunfire and was 
buried in the al-Bureij refugee cam. 'Muhammad is not just my son,' he 
said. 'He's the son of entire Palestinian nation.'
