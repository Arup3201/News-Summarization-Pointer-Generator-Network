Two sisters in Ohio, aged 4 and 6, who returned to the U.S. from Sierra Leone 17 days prior were rushed to a hospital around 2am Sunday over Ebola fears after spiking fevers.

The unidentified Columbus girls were taken to Nationwide Children's Hospital, where they were put in isolation, but later tested negative for the dreaded tropical disease.

They were in West Africa with their mother, who was not there as a healthcare worker and is not believed to be at high-risk for Ebola.

Ebola? Two girls were taken to nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio early Sunday after developing possible Ebola symptoms 17 days after returning from Seirra Leone

Risks: The girls are more likely to have influenza, rather than Ebola, officials say, but their travel history means caution is needed

They were taken to the hospital by EMS staff who wore protective gear and are not considered to be at risk for Ebola.

'We are following all protocol for safety to make sure everybody at the hospital and the EMS and everyone is safe,' Jose Rodriguez, spokesman for Columbus Public Health, told the Columbus Dispatch.

Rodriguez said the girls were not symptomatic on Saturday morning, when officials last checked in on them.

According to Rodriguez, at least one of the girls is suffering from a cough, which is not a symptom of Ebola.

'Even though they traveled to the region, they had no known contact with a patient that was either living with or died from Ebola,' Rodriquez told 10tv.com.

Spokeswoman Gina Bericchia told the Dispatch in an email that influenza is more likely to blame for the girls' illness.

'A respiratory virus is more likely to be the cause, but we must rule out Ebola,' she wrote.

Results from both an influenza and Ebola test were expected sometime Sunday.

Sierra Leone is one of the three affected countries along with Liberia and Guinea.

Ebola has killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa. 

Precautions: Hospital spokesman Jose Rodriguez told reporters the girls were a low risk for Ebola but that tests are needed to confirm they're negative for the deadly virus
