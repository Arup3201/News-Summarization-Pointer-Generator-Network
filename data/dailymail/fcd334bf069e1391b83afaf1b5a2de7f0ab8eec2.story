The FBI has joined a search for a 21-year-old college student who disappeared from a busy Philadelphia bar early Thursday morning after getting separated from friends.

West Chester University senior Shane Montgomery was last seen leaving Kildare's bar in the Manayunk neighborhood around 2am Thursday and hasn't been seen since.

According to WPVI, the agency has plastered Montgomery's face on digitized billboards across the city offering a reward of $25,000 for credible information regarding his disappearance.

Vanished: Police say Shane Montgomery, 21, was home from West Chester University and met up with some friends on Wednesday night at the crowded Kildare's bar in the Manayunk neighborhood, before disappearing

Officials have also begun interviewing staff from the bar, along with friends and family, and have reportedly administered lie detector tests. 

An FBI spokesperson told WCAU-TV that taskforces from the agency often get involved in cases where people have disappeared under 'suspicious circumstances.'

On Sunday, authorities were searching the cold waters of the Manayunk Canal as members of Montgomery's family watched from the banks.

'I want to find Shane and I want to bring him home,' said his mother, Karen Montgomery, to NBC Philadelphia,

Volunteers had been aiding local authorities in the search, but on Sunday family members issued a statement asking them not to gather. 

'I just wanted to reach out and remind everyone we are NOT meeting today until we are given the okay from the Marine Unit and Search and Rescue,' a statement on a Facebook page for the search read. 

Worried: Montgomery's parents, Kevin and Karen, watch as police marine units search the waters for their son on Sunday

Search unit: A Philadelphia Police Marine Unit tried to search the depths of the Manayunk canal in Philadelphia on Sunday

Missing person: A Crime Scene Unit member searches the canal in Manayunk  for Shane Montgomery on Saturday

'We would like the authorities to be able to do their search thoroughly and without any unintentional interferences from the volunteers.'

'Thank you for the continued prayers, positive thoughts, donations, and shares, as well as a big thank you all the people who have come out in the cold to help us look for Shane.' 

Police say Montgomery was home for Thanksgiving when he met up  with some friends on Wednesday night at the crowded Kildare's bar.

Authorities say he became separated from them and was escorted out by a bouncer around 2am Thursday after stumbling on a bar stool. 

In the wake of his disappearance, Jim Townsend, the director of operations at Kildare's, came forward to shed light on what happened when Montgomery was last seen.

A search of the records at the bar turned up a tab for Montgomery totaling $17, which Townsend told WPVI was for three craft beers. 

Support: Hundreds of volunteers gather in St. John the Baptist church in Manayunk to organize a search for 21-year-old Shane Montgomery

Reward: Montgomery, who is still unaccounted for, was last seen leaving Kildare's Irish Pub in Manayunk very early Thanksgiving morning, and there is now a $25,000 reward for information on where he is

Missing: Shane Montgomery was last seen Thanksgiving Eve around 1:45am as he was leaving Kildare's bar along Main Street in Philadelphia 

He said that Montgomery did not appear intoxicated and though he bumped into the DJ table accidentally, he was polite about it.

An employee at Kildare's, who is a relative of Montgomery's, walked him to the exit around closing time and security saw him leave the door and turn south on Main Street.

Montgomery's cellphone pinged near the CVS Pharmacy, located less than a mile from Kildare's, about an hour after he was last seen at the bar, but that signal could be picked up at a radius of 4,500 feet. 

The search began on Thanksgiving, after the college senior, who was visiting his family over the Thanksgiving holiday, did not return to his parents' home that day.

Upset: A woman is comforted by another during a candlelight vigil for Shane Montgomery, at a park across from Kildare's Irish Pub in Manayunk on Saturday

Lost: Police say 21-year-old Shane Montgomery was home from West Chester University and met up with friends Wednesday night at a crowded bar

Distinctive: This is a photo of the Celtic cross tattoo on Montgomery's shoulder

On Saturday, about 200 volunteers helped search Main Street in Manayunk and the nearby banks of the Schuylkill  River.

Authorities have used K-9s, helicopters and marine units as part of the search.

The search was so widespread that the city cancelled a Christmas tree lighting ceremony and caroling activities and instead the organization held a candlelight vigil at the Canal View Park.

Montgomery is a liberal arts major and a former high school runner. 

He is 5-foot-11 and 130 pounds, with short brown hair and green eyes, with a  Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder. 

Witnesses say he was wearing a buttoned- down gray shirt, gray hoodie and jeans when he left the bar.
