The family of a Texas man who was shot dead on Christmas night by his neighbor claims he may have been sleepwalking at the time.

Spencer Crandall of Rhome was banging on the door of his neighbor's house and ringing the bell when the incident occurred, sometime around 4am on December 26.

And when that neighbor saw Crandall trying to crawl over a privacy fence on the property he retrieved a firearm and, when a brief struggle ensued and Crandall attempted to enter the front door of the home, the owner shot him dead. 

It is being reported that the incident occurred at the home of Craig Rigtrub, who did not know Crandall.

'He [the homeowner] told Mr. Crandall he was armed, "This is not your house." He was still trying to get in, at that point the homeowner fired one round and striked Mr. Crandall to the chest,' Wise County Sheriff David Walker told ABC News.

The owner's daughter called 911 during the incident, and when the authorities arrived on the scene Crandall was dead.

This as Crandall’s wife, Amanda Crandall, who was away at the time, revealed to police that her husband had a history of sleepwalking, and may not have been aware of his actions at the time.

Making the sleepwalking worse may have been the fact that Spencer was also taking muscle relaxants to help with a ruptured disc in his back.

On top of that, with his wife away, Spencer may have also been drinking beer according to his brother Ryan.

Spencer and his wife Amanda were just married earlier this year. 

'He was hurting really, really bad on Christmas Eve,' Ryan told WFAA.

'He would only have obtained it for the purpose of dealing with his back pain.'  

'We may not ever know why he was trying to get into the house,' said Sheriff Walker.

The incident is said to have occurred at the home of Craig Rigtrub (above), who did not know Crandall 

Together: Days before the horrific incident the entire family gathered for a holiday photo

Spencer's sister Jessica meanwhile took to Facebook to speak about the tragedy, writing; 'On Dec. 26, my sweet, precious brother Spencer's life was taken away from us. I will never get over the sorrow of losing him so early in life, he was only 31, but together with our family I know we will get through this tragedy.'

She then added; 'Thank you to our friends and family who continue to lift us up with your love and prayers. We love Spencer. His wife Amanda will always be part of our family.' 

Even more heartbreaking is the fact that the entire family wad together just days before as they took a Christmas Eve photo. 

No charges have been filed against the homeowner, whose name has not been released.
