A murder investigation was underway today after a man was attacked and died at a New Year's Eve Party.

Police were called to the party suite in the early hours of the morning following the incident in Sheffield.

South Yorkshire Police said they launched a murder investigation following the death at the Stars and Mayfair Party Suites.

Murder investigation: A man died following a disturbance at these party suites on the outskirts of Sheffield last night

A spokesman said: 'Officers understand a confrontation led to a man being assaulted, sustaining injuries from which he died.

'The investigation is in its very early stages with inquiries at the scene likely to continue throughout today.'

The spokesman asked for witnesses, including people who attended the function, to come forward.

He said the man's age and other details were not available at this time.

The venue is a set of party suites which, according to its website, caters for functions for 50 to 700 guests, including weddings and birthday parties.

The scene was cordoned off this morning, with police and forensic officers in white overalls going in and out of the building and a number of police vehicles parked outside.

The venue is in a large building which was well-known in the city for many years as a casino and ice rink complex.

It is on a main road, which is one of the busiest routes into Sheffield from the south, and is just a short walk from the city's main railway station.

Passers-by said they were shocked by the death.

One pensioner said: 'It's a terrible way to start a New Year, isn't it?

'People going out just to have a good time and then this happens.'

Police officers on the scene after a girl, believed to be aged 15, was arrested over the murder in Luton today

Three other people died after being attacked at New Year's Eve Parties, police said today.

A teenage girl was being held on suspicion of stabbing a middle-aged man to death at a house party.

The 42-year-old victim, known only as Michael, was co-hosting the event with girlfriend Mandy O'Neill in LUTON, BEDFORDSHIRE.

He suffered a heart attack after being knifed at the party and died within an hour.

Detectives today arrested a girl believed to be aged around 15 on suspicion of carrying out the attack.

Police were initially unable to question many of the guests at the party because they were drunk.

Neighbours told how at 3am they had 
'loads of screaming' coming from the house party and then squads of 
police and a paramedic crew arrived.

One neighbour said a lot of teenagers and adults had attended the party.

'They were playing music throughout the night which wasn't too bad, nothing out of the ordinary,' she said.

'Then the music suddenly stopped and there was a lot of shouting and fighting.

'You could hear people fighting. Then there were these awful screams and people running from the house in a state.

'A group of girls were the first to come out and they bolted down an alleyway at the bottom of the road.'

Police had sealed of a large section of the quiet cul-de-sac as forensic teams worked in the house and back garden.

** Separately, a young man was shot dead in CLERKENWELL, LONDON, in the early hours of New Year's Day.

The 22-year-old victim was found suffering from gunshot wounds at around 5am. A suspect, aged in his 20s, was being held at a north London plice station.

** A man in his 20s died following an 'incident' outside a pub in TOFT MONKS, NORFOLK, police said.

Two men, aged 38 and 45, have been arrested in connection with the death.

Police said the incident was being treated as 'unexplained' but a post-mortem examination was to be carried out.

** Two young women were killed in a car crash just hours into the New Year close to CAERNARFON, NORTH WALES.

The driver and passenger died at the scene after their silver Vauxhall Corsa hit a wall at around 6am this morning.

** A 27-year-old woman was in hospital after being stabbed in the back just before midnight last night.

The woman was rushed to hospital after being attacked in CHELTENHAM. Two women, aged 27 and 42, were being questioned.

** A Thai woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a pensioner was found dead in the home that they shared.

The woman who is aged in her 40s was found with a head injury at 10.05pm on Friday when police broke into the semi-detached house in HAVERHILL, SUFFOLK.
