Plans for a phone with a transparent screen with touch screen technology on both the front and back have been revealed in what could be the next step forward in smartphone technology.Tech giant Samsung has filed a patent for a future transparent display that can be controlled by fingertip from both sides of the phone.Pictures of the device have been filed with the U.S. show the potential benefits of the technology, such as the user's finger not obscuring the screen when tapping on apps or dragging items around the screen.

Great leap forward: Samsung have filed a patent for a phone with a transparent display that has touch screen technology on both sides

It could be especially effective for touch screen games. A tap on the rear of the phone could also bring up extra options or information about what is on the screen, such as text associated with a photo, such as comments on a photo posted on Facebook or Instagram.The user will also be able to fast forward, rewind and play video by using backside gestures without blocking their view of the footage.

One of the pictures contained within the patent shows how taking a photo of what is displayed on the screen could be as simple as a quick dragging gesture.

The back screen can be used for security measures

Users could even move top and bottom display items around independently which could be useful for photo manipulation or art apps.

There is no indication when the phone will hit the market. The patent, uncovered by Patentbolt, was filed in the summer but contains no details on time frames.

Samsung was not available for comment.
