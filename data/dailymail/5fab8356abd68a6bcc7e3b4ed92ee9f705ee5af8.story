Behind every good king: The 41-year-old divorcee looked radiant in the sun as she hobnobbed with dignitaries during a reception for Mexico's Pena Nieto on the steps of the Zarzuela Palace, in Madrid

Princess Letizia looked every inch a queen-in-waiting today as she joined her husband and father-in-law in welcoming the Mexican president to Spain.

The 41-year-old divorcee looked radiant in the sun as she hobnobbed with dignitaries during a reception for President Pena Nieto on the steps of the Zarzuela Palace, in Madrid.

She showed her already blossoming talent for statesmanship, appearing to get on particularly well with Nieto's wife, Angelica Rivera de Pena, laughing and chatting as if they'd been friends for years.

Meanwhile, her father-in-law Juan Carlos of Spain showed there's 
still life in the old king yet as he laughed and joked heartily with Mr Nieto during a photo call, two days before the Spanish parliament 
vote on whether he can hand his crown to son Felipe.

The vote, on Wednesday, will decide whether to adopt a proposal for emergency legislation that allows the unprecedented move to abdicate and hand over his duties to his son.

The three men, Letizia and Mrs Rivera de Pena were joined by Carlos' wife, Queen Sophia, and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy for the three-day visit which aims to improve business ties between the two countries.

The reception came a week after the 
announcement that the 76-year-old king plans to end his four-decade 
reign in favor of his son, 46-year-old Prince Felipe.

The
 king, who is expected to leave the throne this month, said he was 
abdicating so that fresh royal blood can help rally the nation.

It
 came days after it was claimed Carlos told courtiers he decided to 
abdicate because he did not want his son to ‘wither’ and ‘grow old 
waiting for the throne like Prince Charles’.

Meet and greet: The king, who is expected to leave the throne this month, said he was abdicating so that fresh royal blood can help rally the nation

In a televised address, the 76-year-old, who has ruled since 1975,  said he wanted to herald in a ‘new era of hope’ and ensure a ‘younger generation… with new energies’ could take over the helm.

According to reports in the Spanish press, the king told aides he felt the time was right to pass the throne on while Prince Felipe was still a young man.

‘I do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles,’ he reportedly told Rafael Spottorno, chief of the royal household.

The private secretary said the king – whose popularity has slumped in recent years following a series of scandals – had been considering abdicating since his 75th birthday in January last year. 

Steady feet: Despite needing a stick to walk, the king appeared steady on his feet amid concerns in the Spanish press over his ailing health

‘He saw, above all, that his son was in his prime and didn’t want to see him like Prince Charles who will be 66 years old in November,’ Mr Spottorno told Spanish daily newspaper El Mundo.

However, last week, a source at the royal palace in Madrid claimed King Juan Carlos was abdicating for  political reasons.

The monarch’s popularity has nosedived amid accusations of being out of touch as his country struggles with its worst economic crisis in memory.

Waiting: It came days after it was claimed Carlos told courtiers he decided to abdicate because he did not want his son to 'wither' and 'grow old waiting for the throne like Prince Charles'

In 2012, he was widely criticised for going on a secret hunting trip to Botswana to shoot elephants. The lavish holiday contrasted with the news at home that one in four Spanish workers was jobless.

Prince Charles has been waiting for 62 years and four months – longer  than any other heir apparent in British history – to take the throne. He became heir apparent at the age of three when his mother, then Princess Elizabeth, who is now 88, acceded  in 1952.

Stylish, smart and beautiful, Princess Letizia is Spain's answer to Britain's Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge.

Letizia
 Ortiz, from Asturias the north west of Spain, married Prince Felipe de 
Borbon ten years ago at Cathedral Santa María la Real de la Almudena in 
Madrid.

On her big day
 the royal bride dazzled in an ivory gown with a 15-foot-long train and a
 sparkling platinum and diamond tiara, which her mother-in-law Queen 
Sofia wore for her wedding almost exactly 42 years previously.

Anchorwoman: In the years leading up to the couple's engagement in November 2003, she had become a household name in Spain as a reporter and TV anchor, covering historic events such as the 9/11 attacks in New York and the Iraq war

Letizia comes from 
non-aristocratic stock: she is the eldest daughter of Jesús José Ortiz 
Álvarez, a journalist, and first wife María de la Paloma Rocasolano 
Rodríguez, a nurse and hospital union representative from a 
working-class background.

She
 shops at the supermarket and champions Spanish high street fashion 
brands such as Zara and Mango, as well as couturiers such as Felipe 
Varela and Lorenzo Caprile.

Like Kate, her fashion choices are analysed and minutely picked over by the press in Spain. However, unlike Kate, Letizia forged a stellar career for herself before her marriage.

The glamour queen: The 42 year old Princess Letizia will now become Queen of Spain as her husband the Crown Prince will ascend the throne following his father's shock abdication

In the years leading up
 to the couple's engagement in November 2003, she had become a household
 name in Spain as a reporter and TV anchor, covering historic events 
such as the 9/11 attacks in New York and the Iraq war.

Letizia
 gave up her high-flying career on marrying Prince Felipe. The couple 
has since has since had two children, Infanta Leonor de Todos los Santos
 of Spain, born 31 October 2005 - who is next in line - and Infanta 
Sofía de Todos los Santos of Spain, born 29 April 2007.

Letizia
 and Felipe are often spotted taking their daughters to school, with 
even the day of their tenth wedding anniversary, May 22, being no 
exception.

The couple 
marked their wedding anniversary by releasing two new photos of 
themselves with their daughters. Posted on the Spanish royal family's 
official Twitter account, the pictures show Felipe and Letizia taking 
their two girls to school — proving that despite the day's significance,
 it is a working day like any other.

Happy family: The couple marked their wedding anniversary by releasing two new photos of themselves with their daughters

The family currently lives in a residence located a few dozen metres from the Palace of Zarzuela.Letizia,
 who has been described as a 'breath of fresh air' for the Spanish 
monarchy has been praised for her modern approach to being a princess.

In fact, so modern is she that she will become the first divorcee to become queen in Spain's history.

She
 wed Alonso Guerrero Pérez, a writer and a high-school literature 
teacher, on 7 August 1998, in a simple civil ceremony at Almendralejo, 
in Badajoz, after a 10-year courtship. The couple had no children and 
divorced in 1999.

As 
the previous marriage involved only a civil ceremony, the Roman Catholic
 Church did not consider it canonically valid and therefore did not 
require an annulment from the Pope to proceed with a Roman Catholic 
marriage to Felipe, the Prince of Asturias.
