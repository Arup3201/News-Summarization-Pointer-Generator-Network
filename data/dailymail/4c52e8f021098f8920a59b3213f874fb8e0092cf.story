The pop star Toyah Wilcox has revealed she was starved to keep her weight at 7st 3lbs and paid just £30 a week in her 80s heyday.

The star, who is best known for her hits It's a Mystery and I Want to Be Free, said: 'There were no excesses back then, we were on £30 a week. 

'I was weighed once a week and if I went over, even by an ounce, seven stone three pounds, I wasn't allowed to eat.'

Toyah Wilcox is known for Eighties hits It's a Mystery and I Want to Be Free. At the height of her fame, she was refused food if she weighed more than 7st 3lbs and was only paid £30 a week by her record label

She continued: 'You read about rock stars with their private jets but we just weren't allowed that.

'Everything was done on a budget. Whoever was living that lifestyle wasn't near us.'

Toyah, 56, was a huge star at her peak. But she insists today's live music scene means things are actually more lucrative.

Toyah sold up to 75,000 singles a day in 1981 

She said: 'Back then the money went into an account we never saw unless you chased accountants and record companies and demanded to see the books.

'I was selling 75,000 singles a day in 1981 and that would still only get you number four in the charts. 

'Now you can get to number one on 10,000 sales.

'But I think there's more money around now because we can do live work.

'We also employ fewer people - when I'm on the road I'm not taking three trucks and 40 road crew.' 

Toyah and her band were made to live very frugally in their heydey
