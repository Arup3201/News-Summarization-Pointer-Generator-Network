A woman has been charged with the double murder of two young children killed during an arson strike at their home 16 years ago.

Fiaz Begum Munshi is accused of being involved in the firebomb attack which claimed the lives of Majid Khan, aged 15 years, and his eight-year-old sister Anum Khan.

Petrol was squirted through the letterbox and then set alight at their familyâ€™s home in Cowley, Oxon, shortly after 3am on August 26, 1997.

Thames Police confirmed Fiaz Begum Munshi has been charged with murdering Majid Khan, 15, left and his eight-year-old sister Anum, right. The pair died after an arson attack at their home in Oxon in August 1997

Five men were convicted of their murder and imprisoned a year after the tragedy.

Munshi, of Oldham in Lancashire, was arrested by officers on Tuesday. She was today charged in connection with the killings.

The family of Majid and Anum said they hope 'justice will be done'.

The children's mother said she has not been able to visit their graves since their lives were cut short 16 years ago.

'I hope justice will be done,' she said. 'As a mother of these beautiful innocent children I have been waiting for 16 years for this day and I have not been able to visit my son and daughter, Majid and Anum, since they were innocently taken away from me.

'Once justice has been done I have promised myself I will visit Majid and Anum for the first time after 15 years. This is a very emotional time for everybody.'

The statement, released by police, added:
'Mr and Mrs Khan and family would first of all like to thank Allah for 
this day and the police force involved in the arrest of Fiaz Munshi.'

In a statement released by police, the children's mother said: 'I hope justice will be done. As a mother of these beautiful innocent children I have been waiting for 16 years for this day'

Munshi, 38, will appear at Oxford Magistrates' Court later today.

A police spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police, on advice of Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, has charged a 38-year-old woman with two counts of murder in connection with a fatal fire in Oxford.

'Fiaz Begum Munshi, of Oldham, Lancashire, was arrested on Tuesday, in connection with a fire at a house in Cowley, on August, 26 1997.

'Majid Khan, aged 15, and Anum Khan, aged 8, died as a result of the fire.'

In November 1998 four men were convicted of killing the children following an eight-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

Alan Swanton, Haq Nawaz, Mohammed Nawaz, and Thomas Liedl were sentenced to life in prison.

Swanton, of Letchworth, Herts, was given a minimum sentence of 15 years, Liedl, of Letchworth, got 15 years, Mohammed Nawaz, of Letchworth, got 17 years, and Haq Nawaz, also of Letchworth, got 22 years.

Haroon Sharif, of Oxford, was also found guilty of murder by a jury majority of ten to two. He got 20 years in jail.
