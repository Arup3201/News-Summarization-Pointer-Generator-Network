The final 24 hours of the Roman city of Pompeii are being relived on Twitter today - exactly 1,933 years after an eruption of Mount Vesuvius buried the city beneath a blanket of ash.

The minute-by-minute reconstruction of the city's destruction is based on the tale of Pliny the Elder, the Roman scholar and admiral who took command of the city's evacuation.

The city's cataclysmic final day will be retweeted as it happened from the Twitter account Elder_Pliny, who has been brought to life by experts from the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.

Cataclysmic: The eruption of Vesuvius as imagined by BBC documentary Pompeii: The Last Day. The volcano erupted in 79AD burying the city totally beneath 20ft of ash

Located near to modern day Naples in the Italian region of Campania, Pompeii was buried beneath 20ft of ash when Vesuvius erupted in 79AD

The city's destruction was total, and it remained lost for nearly 1700 years before it was rediscovered by archaeologists in 1748.

Since then, it's painstaking excavation has offered historians detailed insights into life in the Roman Empire, frozen at that moment Pompeii was entombed by the volcano's eruption.

The UNESCO World Heritage site has also become one of Italy's most popular tourist attractions, with some 2.5million visitors a year coming to soak up it's unique history.

Pliny_Elder's day has started 
uneventfully - he seems to be running on Denver time, some eight hours 
behind the local time in Italy.

So
far he has announced he is having lunch, after taking a bath near his 
home in the ancient city of Misenum, across the Bay of Naples from the 
doomed city.

However, he reports, ominously, that a 'strange cloud is rising in the distance.'

Misenum was base to the largest fleet 
of the Roman navy, which Pliny the Elder commanded. Later he will order 
his ships to sail towards Pompeii in an effort to rescue stranded 
victims.

The day does not end will for the admiral. In reality, his story was told by his nephew, the famous Pliny the Younger, who provided a first-hand account of the disaster as seen from Misenum.

Some 25 years after the eruption, the younger Pliny wrote in his letters to Tacitus: 'Ash was falling onto the ships now, darker and denser the closer they went.

'Now it was bits of pumice, and rocks that were blackened and burned and shattered by the fire.

'Now the sea is shoal; debris from the mountain blocks the shore. He paused for a moment wondering whether to turn back as the helmsman urged him.

'"Fortune helps the brave," he said. ...'

The Denver museum is Tweeting the last day of Pompeii today in advance of it's forthcoming exhibition A Day In Pompeii, set to open September 14.

It has already set up a website - dayinpompeii.com - to accompany the exhibition.
