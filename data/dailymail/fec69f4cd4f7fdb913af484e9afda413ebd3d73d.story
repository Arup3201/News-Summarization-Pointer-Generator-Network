Pilot: Jeffrey Buckalew, 45, was in charge of the private plane that he was driving with his family and a friend on board

In a final attempt to save his family, the last words of pilot Jeffrey Buckalew were not poetic but ones of desperation.

'Seven three one charlie alpha, declaring an . . .' were the final words that Mr Buckalew said over the radio before his plane crashed into a New Jersey highway, as he, his wife, their two children, his co-worker, and dog were all aboard.

The two business partners- Mr Buckalew, 45, and Rakesh Chawla, 36- worked at Greenhill & Company in New York but the group was headed south in Mr Buckalew's private plane on Tuesday while he was in the pilot's seat.

Their plane had taken off from nearby Teterboro Airport and was flying to DeKalb Peachtree Airport near Atlanta, Georgia, where the Buckalews had relatives and where Mr Chawla was attending a meeting.

Reports say that While Mr Buckalew and Mr Chawla worked in New York, his wife Corinne Buckalew and children- Jackson, a fifth grader, and Meriwether, a first grader- lived in Charlottesville, Virginia where they lived in a home they bought for $9.15million in 2006.

Mr Chawla, who also had ties to Charlottesville as he attended the University of Virginia, was married and had a daughter at the time of his death.

Mr 
Buckalew's wife, Corinne, and their two young children, Jackson and 
Meriwether, were also on board the plane that was seen losing a wing 
before it crashed.

'If you saw them in the street, you would stop and comment on how lovely they were. All of them, lovely. They were going away on a family trip,' a neighbor told The New York Post.

Mr Buckalew, who owned the plane and had been a pilot for more than ten years, was head of Greenhill & Company's North American Advisory activities, while Mr Chawla was a managing director.

'The firm is in deep mourning over the tragic and untimely death of two of its esteemed colleagues and members of Jeff’s family,' the company said in a statement.

Victims: Corinne Buckalew and her daughter Meriwether were among the five people killed when a small plane crashed on Route 287 on Tuesday morning. Mrs Buckalew's husband Jeffrey and son Jackson also died

'Jeff was one of the first employees of Greenhill. He and Rakesh were extraordinary professionals who were highly respected by colleagues and clients alike.

'They will be sorely missed and our sympathies go out to their families and friends.'

Mr Buckalew was a talented golfer, tying for 94th place on Golf Digest’s list of 'top golfers in finance' in 2007.

He flew his plane to board meetings in North Carolina, said James W. May, from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where the father-of-two received his BA and MBA.

'It was clearly something he enjoyed. It brought a smile to his face,' Mr May told the New York Times.

Ms Buckalew was a visual artist who was on the board of the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts in Amherst, Virginia.

The crash came as a surprise to many who knew Mr Buckalew since he was such an experienced pilot.

Crashed: The plane left Teterboro Airport shortly before crashing on Tuesday

Emergency services remain at the scene of the crash, which occurred at 10 a.m. on Tuesday.

Charred debris is strewn beneath the trees and on the highway itself, as seen on helicopter footage from local news stations.

Wreckage has been found as far as half a mile away from the site of impact, with a wing found in a tree of a home about a quarter of a mile away.

Site: The plane came to a halt in a wooded area separating the north and southbound lanes on I-287

Chris Covello, from Rockaway Township, told the Associated Press he saw the plane spin out of control.

'It was like the plane was doing tricks or something, twirling and flipping,' he said.

'It started going straight down. I thought any second they were going to pull up. But then the wing came off and they went straight down.'

When the plane crashed, it sent up a 'huge plume of thick black smoke', he added.
