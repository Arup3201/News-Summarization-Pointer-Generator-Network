One stunt sees the male run, slide along the floor before reaching in to kiss the crocodile on the tip of its nose without it even flinching.

And not to be out done, the female casually puts the crocodile into a relaxed trance using a bamboo stick, before carefully placing her head between its gaping jaws.

Ian Maclean, who shot the footage during a recent trip to the show, said: 'Would you take this job for $7, considering the dangers?

'One performers actually did have his head crushed while locked in the massive jaws of a crocodile.'

A study with reptiles at Florida's St. Augustine Aliigator Farm Zoological Park found that the reptiles slam their jaws shut with 3,700 pounds per square inch.

A human chomps a steak at around 150 to 200 per square inch.

Last year a trainer at a popular tourist crocodile farm near Bangkok was lucky to escape serious injury when one of the reptiles snapped its jaws shut on his head

He was bitten when his hand slipped on the wet ground and accidentally brushed the animal's cheek.

He had 30 stitches from his ear to his scalp, but his injuries were not life-threatening.
