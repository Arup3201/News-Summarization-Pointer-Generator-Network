With 10 days separating West Ham United's loss against Chelsea with their next Premier League fixture, an away trip to Arsenal, the Hammers have jetted off to Dubai for a team break.

Midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate uploaded a picture to Instagram  with team-mates Diafra Sakho, Enner Valencia and Adrian with the caption 'ready to (go to) Dubai with my guys'.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce will be hoping the warm weather getaway will allow his players to freshen up ahead of their final 10 league games of the season.

Winston Reid had to leave the game against Chelsea after eight minutes with a hamstring problem

The club are tenth in the Premier League after Wednesday's 1-0 defeat to Jose Mourinho's side with 39 points but are only three  behind Stoke in eighth.

But on Thursday, Allardyce was boosted by Winston Reid emphatically ending reports that he will depart Upton Park at the end of the season by penning a six-and-a-half year contract at the club.

'It's one of those things that took a bit of time, but we got there in the end,' Reid, 26, said upon announcing the news. 

Reid's game against Chelsea was curtailed after only eight minutes due to a hamstring problem but the New Zealand international hopes his team's break will allow him to recover swiftly.

'It's just one of those things with the injury,' Reid said. 'I had it a little after Crystal Palace and unfortunately it flared up again. It's just part of the game I guess.

'We've got some time to recover now, which is much needed.'

West Ham are not the only side trying to turn their absence from the FA Cup into a positive.

Southampton flew to Switzerland for a team break on Wednesday, a day after their win over Crystal Palace.
