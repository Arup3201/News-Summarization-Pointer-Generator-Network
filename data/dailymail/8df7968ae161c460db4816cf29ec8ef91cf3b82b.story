Killed: Caroline Corvalan, 33, was found dead in a Paris street

A dismembered body found underneath a Paris street belonged to a woman TV journalist, it emerged today.

The macabre remains in a service duct are of Caroline Corvalan, 33, who broadcast from the Riviera resort of Cannes for the France 3 station.

Detectives have now launched a murder investigation, and have appealed for anybody who knew her to come forward.

Ms Corvalan, who was described by colleagues as someone who ‘loved life and journalism’, was reported missing on August 20th after not turning up for work.

Last week, on September 24th, maintenance men examining a service duct underneath a street in the 18th arrondissement of Paris found Ms Corvalan’s decomposed torso.

The journalist’s remains were so badly mutilated that she could only be identified by her fingerprints.

In a further twist, Police said there had been a mysterious burglary at Ms Corvalan's nearby flat.

A police source told Le Parisien newspaper: ‘On September 18th, one or more strangers went into her home to steal her phone, a digital tablet, a coat and her handbag.’

Family members keeping an eye on the 
apartment while Ms Corvalan was away reported the theft, but 
investigating officers were intrigued to see the ‘stolen’ camera 
reappear a few days later.

‘The camera is currently being examined, but for the moment we cannot explain this strange fact,’ said the police source.

Ms Corvalan, who spoke English fluently, was known to have a troubled love life, and had been receiving treatment for ‘mood disorders’.

A family statement about Ms Corvalan reads: ‘She had a huge heart and helped many homeless people. She suffered a lot in this life. She was such a lovely person, always sensitive and always spoke from the heart.’

Ms Corvalan, who is originally from the south of France, moved into television from print journalism in 2006.

One ex colleague said she had recently suffered from ‘two romantic let downs’.
