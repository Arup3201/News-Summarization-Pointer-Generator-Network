Merseyside Police have withdrawn a legal challenge to the kick-off time of Saturday's Everton versus Liverpool derby at Goodison Park.

The force were concerned that the 5.30pm start would increase the risk of alcohol-fuelled crowd trouble and leave the taxpayer with a big bill to foot.

In a rare action, they launched an appeal against the decision made by Liverpool council and the Safety Advisory Group to allow the televised clash to take place so late.

But at South Sefton Magistartes Court on Tuesday morning they withdrew that appeal following assurances from Everton that they would improve segregation at the eagerly-anticipated clash.

The hearing could have had huge implications for broadcasters, given that a decision to put the match back to 3pm would have seen them unable to screen it live.

A Merseyside Police spokesman said that all parties would meet within 28 days to ensure similar issues did not arise in future.

Deputy Chief Constable Andy Cooke, said: 'Our opposition around the late kick-off time has been constant throughout and our paramount concern has always been the safety of those attending the game.

'Ideally we would have preferred that this situation could have been resolved much earlier and we have pressed throughout to get the time changed. The force accepts that any change to the kick-off time at this stage would have considerable inconvenience for those fans who were going to the game. 

'But unfortunately we were given no option but to appeal to the courts and today we have been able to come to agreement about the way forward.

'The decision to go with a 5.30pm kick-off for this game creates unnecessary risk. We have tried to do everything possible to get this situation resolved as quickly as possible.

'Our request to move the kick-off time is in no way a reflection of the behaviour of fans from either club, as the majority of people who attend the games are genuine fans who go to enjoy the football and have a good time.

'Unfortunately, there is a significant minority who take the opportunity to drink and cause problems, and the additional hours before the game give these people the opportunity to spoil what should be a good afternoon out at the football.

'The 5.30pm kick off time presents different challenges for the force and the club and increases the impact of the event, not only to the city centre but across Merseyside. The plan for a late kick off requires 254 police officers covering the area around the stadium, inside the stadium and also the city centre. 

'The operation would be extended to 17 hours, which would result in valuable resources being displaced from their ordinary duties from across Merseyside. Additional resources would also be deployed to police licensed premises across the county. 

'The cost of that operation to date would be £78,500 and at least £50,000 of that would not be recoverable from club. There is no doubt that the late kick off, to facilitate the match being played on live TV, would significantly stretch our resources.'
