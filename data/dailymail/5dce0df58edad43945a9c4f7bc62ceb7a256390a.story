Britain spends nearly four times more on providing health and welfare cover than Romania, according to European Union officials.

They found that the UK spent £7,000 on welfare for every man, woman and child in the country in 2012 – more than a quarter of the national income.

Health provision, family subsidies, old age benefits and pensions for workers in Romania are a fraction of those in Britain.

Britain is the fifteenth biggest welfare spender in Europe - with a benefits bill £1,000 higher per person than the average 

The huge differences in support were laid out in an EU paper, the details of which have been published by the Office for National Statistics.

It comes at a time when both David Cameron and Ed Miliband have pledged to cut benefits for immigrants from Europe.

The Prime Minister has said he will stop EU citizens from claiming benefits for four years, and the Labour leader has spoken about extending the waiting period before EU migrants can claim and preventing tax credits and child benefit being paid for children who live abroad.

Figures show that since autumn 2013 more than 100,000 Romanians have applied for national insurance numbers to allow them to work in Britain.

George Osborne, at Manchester City's new City Football Academy, wants to slash welfare spending

The latest paper, from the EU’s statistics arm Eurostat, compares countries’ social spending using a measure called the ‘purchasing power standard’ (PPS) to even out price differences. This means its results take into account the fact that the same sum of money can buy much more in some countries than others. According to the measure, Romania spent 2,080.1 on welfare for every member of its population in 2012.

This covered benefits and pensions for older people, healthcare, family support, disability benefits, housing, unemployment support, and widows’ benefits. 

British spending on welfare was 7,356.8 on the PPS measure. Translated into sterling, that meant £6,959 per person. The £443.3billion total spend amounted to more than 28 per cent of GDP.

The ONS analysis found 44.7 per cent of that went on older people, in pensions, winter fuel payments and TV licences.

Much of the rest of the spending was available to EU migrants in some form, with 32.8 per cent going on healthcare, including NHS hospitals, GPs and free or subsidised medicines on prescription.

Together old age pensions, sickness benefits and healthcare spending accounted for more than three quarters of welfare spending in Britain. 

Britain spent 5.5 per cent of its welfare budget on housing – more than five times the EU average. Although there are few official figures, occupation of council and social housing by newly arrived immigrants has been a source of tension, particularly in East London, since the mid-2000s.

British social spending was also more than twice as high as social spending in Poland, counted as 3,278.2 in PPS terms.

Romania had the lowest social spend of any EU country, while Britain’s was 17.5 per cent above average, the report said.

A study by the MigrationWatch think-tank last year said Romanian families can improve their living standards eight or nine times by coming to Britain. A family with one worker, a dependent spouse and two children can claim housing benefit, council tax benefit, child benefit, and tax credits.

 Across Europe Britain is the fifteenth largest spender on social protection – behind France, Germany and Italy. But more than Spain, Greece and Portugal.

Luxembourg spent more on welfare per head than any other country – lavishing twice as much as the European average. 

Chancellor George Osborne has vowed to cut billions off the welfare budget if the Tories win the next election.

He wants to cut £3billion off tax credits, paid as a top-up to five million families on poor wages, in an attempt to rein back welfare spending.

Mr Osborne said he would freeze all working-age benefits, including child benefit for two years.

Tax credits cost £29.7billion last year - more than six times the £4.6bill for jobseeker’s allowance, and nearly double the cost of housing benefit.

In the autumn statement, Mr Osborne said: 'Total welfare spending is now set to be £1bn a year lower than forecast at the budget and will go on falling as a share of our GDP. And as I’ve made clear I believe we need to freeze working-age benefits for two years – saving billions more.'

A freeze on working-age benefits would knock as much as £350 a year off the income of a low-income family with one child.
