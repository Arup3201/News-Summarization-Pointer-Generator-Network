There is no questioning Raheem Sterling's talent on the football pitch. His Dobby impression, on the other hand, is a little frightening.

The Liverpool forward, who will have grown up in the same era as the Harry Potter series, provided a remarkable impression of Dobby the Elf, to the delight of one of his friends.

It is certainly a contender for weirdest clip of the season, as the 20-year-old puts on a squeaky voice to imitate the character, voiced by Toby Jones in the JK Rowling adaptations.

Raheem Sterling has had a busy season on the pitch, playing in 41 matches for Liverpool in all competitions

In the video, Sterling squeaks: 'Harry Potter must not go to Hogwarts, or else he'll be in mortal danger,' before the camera pans to his friend, howling with laughter.

'Dobby must protect Harry,' Sterling concludes, before the video cuts out.

On the pitch, Sterling has helped the Reds to fifth in the league, and is expected to start against Swansea on Monday, where they can close the gap on fourth to just two points.

Sterling himself has made 41 appearances in a Liverpool shirt this season, scoring 10 goals.
