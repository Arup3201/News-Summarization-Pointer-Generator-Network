Perhaps the excuse of ‘it was my first day’ wouldn’t cut the mustard so well for this unfortunate writer.

David Cay Johnston was forced to retract his first-ever column for Reuters, but his huge mistake on a tax story was made more odd by the fact he already has a Pulitzer Prize for financial reporting.

Mr Johnston has admitted his piece for the top news agency - in which he claimed Rupert Mudoch’s News Corp got a $4.8billion tax refund for the past four years - was ‘100 per cent dead wrong’.

Red-faced: Financial journalist and lecturer David Cay Johnston was forced to retract his first-ever column for Reuters on a tax story about News Corp

He has worked as a lecturer since leaving the New York Times in 2008, after winning a Pulitzer Prize in 2001 for excellent work in exposing loopholes and inequities in the U.S. tax code.

But a red-faced Mr Johnston, who has enjoyed a successful 45-year career in journalism, has been forced to write a ‘skinback’ retraction for the first time in his life after a ‘bonehead error’.

His story about the embattled company News Corp was followed up by a number of news outlets around the world, including MailOnline.

The mistake was highlighted by Robert S. McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice, who pointed out News Corp has been using negative numbers to report outflows, rather than tax inflows, since 2007.

Successful: Mr Johnston's huge mistake was made more odd by the fact he won a Pulitzer Prize for financial reporting in 2001 at the New York Times

Mr Johnston, who teaches at Syracuse University College of Law in New York, realised that News Corp had in fact paid the $4.8billion sum in cash for corporate income taxes between 2007 and 2010.

‘I will do all I can to make sure 
everyone who has read or heard secondary reports based on my column also
learns the facts and would appreciate the help of readers in that 
cause’

David Cay Johnston

He said he did not know about the switch in convention for reporting positive and negative numbers because he missed a note on Page 87 of the company’s annual report in 2007.

Note 2 on that page said: ‘Certain fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2007 presentation.’

‘For the first time in my 45-year-old career I am writing a skinback,' Mr Johnston wrote. 'That is what journalists call a retraction of the premise of a piece, as in peeling back your skin and feeling the pain.'

‘I will do all I can to make sure everyone who has read or heard secondary reports based on my column also learns the facts and would appreciate the help of readers in that cause.’

Error: Mr Johnston realised that Mr Murdoch's News Corp had in fact paid $4.8 billion in cash for corporate income taxes between 2007 and 2010

But not everything in his piece was an error - as Mr Johnston pointed out, News Corp are indeed experts at making use of tax deferrals and it has the third most subsidiaries in tax havens.

‘Until now I have never made a big mistake, but this is a painful reminder that we all put our pants on one leg at a time'

David Cay Johnston

‘Tax is my beat, and I was simply looking for what the record showed since Mr Murdoch is much in the news these days,’ he wrote. ‘

‘Having a long career writing not just about tax, but also about journalistic misconduct, I wondered if there was anything of interest in News Corp's annual disclosure reports, known as 10-K forms.’

‘Until now I have never made a big mistake, but this is a painful reminder that we all put our pants on one leg at a time,’ he wrote, adding that he has tried to correct the error as quickly as possible.
