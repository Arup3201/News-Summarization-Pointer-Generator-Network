A decades-long feud between two Chicago families boiled over ended with an off-duty police officer shooting dead an elderly man who shot the cop's wife.

Joe Huff, 86, is dead and both Hazel Jones, 85, and Cathryn Anthony, 58, were taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds Saturday afternoon. They are expected to survive.

Police say the unnamed off-duty cop opened fire after Huff shot his wife with a shotgun and then Jones reached for it, but relatives of the slain man and neighbors say Anthony has a history of problems in the South Side neighborhood.

Gunned down: Joe Huff was shot dead after opening fire on an off-duty police officer's wife

‘I'm dreaming right now,’ grieving granddaughter Ebony Huff told WMAQ. ‘My grandfather's not dead. He's been in to it with these people next door to him for years. 

‘He has paperwork against these people.’

Problems started about 2.15 p.m. between Jones and Anthony, with the older woman throwing dirt and rocks at the officer’s wife and striking her with a broom, cops said.

The officer saw Huff go outside and return with a shotgun, firing shots into her arm and head, according to police.

‘Fearing for his life and the life of his wife the officer discharged his weapon striking the male offender,’ the department said.

Jones then reached for the shotgun while being told not to by Anthony’s husband, leaving him little option but to shoot her as well. She was struck in the hand and leg.

Huff was pronounced dead at the scene, Anthony is in stable condition at a local hospital and Jones was treated for her wounds and released, officials said.

‘The minute a shotgun gets involved and somebody pulls the trigger it goes from being a simple dispute to a tragedy,’ a police official told WMAQ.

Both families have lived on the same block since at least the late 1960s, according to neighbor Judith Blake. Anthony’s husband moved into the home about 10 years ago, and things seemingly escalated from there.

‘The police and his wife are always messing with the {Huffs],’ Blake told MailOnline. ‘Every time I look up they are arguing.’

Blake says the Anthonys routinely sprayed the Huffs’ property with water, shoveled snow in front of their driveway and constantly argued.

‘Who's in the grass, don't step in my yard... it's been ongoing, nothing that just happened today,’ the officer’s niece, Linda Anthony, told the station.

Blake said she personally never had any problems with either family, but said Anthony ‘is always doing some conniving thing to people’ and is constantly arguing with others.

She could not recall the Huff family having any similar issues with neighbors.

A police spokesperson declined to say if charges would be filed against any of the individuals involved and said the investigation remains ongoing.
