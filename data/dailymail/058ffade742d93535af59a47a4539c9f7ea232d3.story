The Food and Drug Administration is recommending an end to the nation's lifetime ban on blood donations from gay and bisexual men, a 31-year-old policy that many medical groups and gay activists say is no longer justified.

The Obama administration's FDA said Tuesday that it favors replacing the blanket ban with a new policy barring donations from men who have had man-on-man sex in the previous 12 months.

The new policy would put the U.S. in line with other countries including Australia, Japan and the U.K.

Democrats in Congress quickly complained that the move didn't go far enough.

Senator Patty Murray of the state of Washington, who will be Democrats/ ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in January, called it 'a welcome step in the right direction.' 

Activists, however, questioned whether requiring a year of celibacy from gay men before a donation amounted to a significant policy shift.

The Food and Drug Administration said on December 23 that it will move to ease a lifetime ban on blood donations from homosexual men, allowing them to give but only after a year of abstaining from sexual activity

'De facto lifetime ban': Gay males will be able to give blood in the United States, but only if they haven't actually had sex with a man in 12 months 

'This new policy cannot be justified in light of current scientific research and updated blood screening technology,' said David Stacy of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest U.S. gay rights group.

Other activists said the new proposal would continue to stigmatize gay and bisexual men.

'This new policy does not require heterosexual blood donors to be celibate for one year. Some may believe this is a step forward, but in reality, requiring celibacy for a year is a de facto lifetime ban,' Gay Men's Health Crisis, a New York-based nonprofit that supports AIDS prevention and care, said after the announcement. 

Murray said she was 'disappointed that low-risk gay men are still being discriminated against with this outdated policy.' 

'Healthy Americans who don’t engage in risky behavior, regardless of their sexual orientation, should have the opportunity to donate blood and help in the effort to save lives,' she said.

Fellow Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin agreed.

'The Administration must continue to work towards implementing blood donation policies based on individual risk factors,' Baldwin said in a statement, instead of singling out one group of people and turning away healthy, willing donors, even when we face serious blood shortages.' 

The lifetime ban dates from the early years of the AIDS crisis and was intended to protect the blood supply from what was a then little-understood disease. 

But many medical groups, including the American Medical Association, say the policy is no longer supported by science, given advances in HIV testing. Gay activists say the ban is discriminatory and perpetuates negative stereotypes.

The agency will recommend the switch in draft guidelines early next year and move to finalize them after taking comments from the public, FDA officials told reporters. 

FDA Deputy Director Dr. Peter Marks declined to give a timeframe for completing the process but said, 'we commit to working as quickly as possible on this issue.'

Marks said some of the most compelling evidence for changing the policy comes from Australia, which put in place a one-year ban on donations over a decade ago. 

Recently published studies showed no change in the safety of the blood supply after making the switch.

Additionally, studies conducted by the U.S. government suggest gay and bisexual men are actually more likely to abide by donation guidelines under a 12-month prohibition period. 

All blood donors take a questionnaire about their health and sexual behavior, but some gay men reportedly answer inaccurately to donate blood.

The Food and Drug Administration made the announcement on Tuesday, bring muted applause from gay rights groups and congressional Democrats who want the agency to go further

All U.S. blood donations are screened for HIV but the test only detects the virus after it's been in the bloodstream about 10 days. 

Still, FDA officials said current research does not support reducing the donation ban below one year.

According to government figures, men who have had sex with other men represent about 2 percent of the U.S. population, yet account for at least 62 percent of all new HIV infections in the U.S. 

The FDA's announcement follows years of government discussions re-examining the ban. Last month a panel of blood safety experts convened by the Department of Health and Human Services voted 16-2 in favor of doing away with the total ban. 

The panel recommended moving to the one-year ban that was formally proposed Tuesday.

The FDA implemented the lifetime ban in 1983, when health officials were first recognizing the risk of contracting AIDS via blood transfusions. 

Under the policy, blood donations are barred from any man who has had sex with another man at any time since 1977 – the start of the AIDS epidemic in the U.S.

The push for a new policy gained momentum in 2006, when the Red Cross, the American Association of Blood Banks, and America's Blood Centers called the ban 'medically and scientifically unwarranted.' 

 Last year the American Medical Association voted to oppose the policy.

Patient groups that rely on a safe blood supply, including the National Hemophilia Foundation, have also voiced support for dropping the ban.

Gay males have been prohibited from giving blood in the US since 1983

Originally the ban was meant to protect the blood supply from HIV/AIDS

Australia changed its policy in the same way 10 years ago and hasn't seen a decline in the safety of its donor blood
