The start of this season's January transfer window has been delayed by 24 hours to open on Saturday – so it fits in with FIFA's wish that it only runs for 31 days.

Clubs have been informed that for 2015 the window will open at the weekend rather than on Friday January 2, as would normally be expected.

The reason is that the last day of the month, January 31, falls on a Saturday when there is a full fixture list including the potential title decider between Chelsea and Manchester City.

With Sunday not classified as a business day, that pushes back the close of the window to Monday February 2.

FIFA have ruled for reasons of fairness and to avoid any major league gaining a competitive advantage, all transfer windows should run for a maximum of 31 days.

Starting on January 2 and running to February 2 would mean the English transfer window being open for 32 days, hence the later start.

A Premier League spokesman confirmed: 'This is about the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) – the system through which all international transfers have to be registered. TMS can only be open for 31 days in the winter window (FIFA rules).

'We have decided to align our window with that in mind. Our rules state that if the final day of a transfer window is a weekend or bank holiday we carry it over to the next working day. This time, January 31 is a Saturday so we will finish on February 2.

'If you count back 31 days from February 2 then you get to January 3 so that is when we are starting. The Bundesliga and Ligue 1 are doing the same. La Liga actually start a day earlier on January 2.'

An FA spokesman confirmed said: 'The window will open at midnight going into Saturday January 3, and close at 11pm on Monday February 2.'

Total spending by Premier League clubs last January was £135million. The record is £225m spent in 2011.

It means that clubs in Spain's La Liga will be able to begin their business earlier than the Premier League's top teams, although the window shuts three days earlier for the likes of Real Madrid.

Most top European leagues, including France's Ligue 1 and Germany's Bundesliga, share the same dates as England, though some, including Italy and Holland, will begin later, opening on Monday January 5.

However in Northern Ireland the window will swing open at midnight on New Year's Eve, lasting the whole of January, with the Irish FA seemingly unworried by public holidays.

That is nothing, however, compared with Chile, who decided to open their transfer window on Christmas day.

The earliest opening window that will still be active in January can be found in Vietnam, where transfers have been possible since mid-October (as part of their longer period, the equivalent of our summer transfer window), while the likes of Russia and Ukraine don't open until the end of the month.
