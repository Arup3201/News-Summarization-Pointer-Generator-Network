Qantas is not altering flight paths over Iraq despite alliance partner Emirates' plans to stop flying above the area within 10 days due to fears of MH17-style attacks.

The Australian airline's decision to keep flying through Iraqi airspace on Dubai to London flights is based on its latest security assessments.

Emirates has decided to re-route planes along different flight paths amid concerns about the dangers posed by Islamic militants on the ground and the risk of missile strikes following the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.

Qantas is not altering flight paths over Iraq despite alliance partner Emirates' plans to stop flying above the area

Despite their joint venture, because the airlines have separate operations teams, Qantas is not required to follow Emirate's lead.

Emirates route change comes after MH17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile while travelling over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 on board, on July 17.

Sir Tim Clark, president of the Dubai-based airline, said he believed other airlines would soon follow suit as he called for government agencies to offer more advice about flying over conflict zones.

Mr Clark said Emirates flights would be re-routed over the next week to ten days and confirmed routes being considered included over Saudi Arabia and the Red Sea, over Cairo and into European airspace, or over Iran.

He said he had taken action because he was no longer ‘comfortable’ with planes flying over ISIS-held territory in Iraq.

'This is a political animal but the fact of the matter is MH17 changed everything, and that was very nearly in European airspace,' he told The Times.

'We cannot continue to say, "Well it's a political thing". We have to do something. We have to take the bull by the horns.'

A Qantas spokesman said the airline constantly reviewed its flight paths and made changes when needed, reported Sydney Morning Herald.

'There is no suggestion that flying over Iraq is unsafe for commercial airlines, particularly given the cruising altitude that most, including Qantas, maintain,' he said. 'We will continue to monitor the situation, with safety as our top priority.'

Qantas has two daily A380 flights on the Dubai-London route, which fly at an altitude of 38,000 to 41,000 feet over Iraq.

The Civil Aviation Safety Authority provides advice to Qantas from US and European regulators and the airline is currently avoiding Syrian airspace.

The move by Emirates could result in longer flight times and increased costs such as fuel and staffing, all of which could be passed onto passengers unless the airline is prepared to cover the costs.

According to an aviation analyst, consumers were unlikely to be prepared to wear these costs when Qantas is seen as one of the world's safest airline.

Emirates currently operates the largest number of flights over Iraq as well as flights to Baghdad, Erbil  and Basra in the country, although no changes to these flights have been outlined as yet.

The country lies on the border of the main flight path between Europe and Asia, with hundreds of aircraft passing over it each day. A popular route is over the Iraqi city of Mosul, a stronghold of ISIS militants.

On Monday, Emirates as well as Lufthansa, British Airways and Qatar Airways were flying in Iraqi airpace, according to FlightRadar24.

ISIS, the terrorist group which took over swathes of Iraq in June and declared it an 'Islamic State', are a brutal, anti-West group which has boasted of holding mass executions, crucifixion and imposing hardline Islamic law on its conquered territory.

The move by Emirates comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between airline industry groups today, which will see chiefs discuss possible ways to reduce the risks of flying over conflict zones.

The meeting, held by the International Civil Aviation Organisation – a United Nations body – comes following two major air disasters this month.

As well as MH17 being shot down, an Air Algerie plane crashed in Mali, north Africa, on Thursday, killing all of the 116 passengers on board. It is not yet clear what brought down the plane.

Some airline insurers are considering pulling coverage for flight over high-risk areas over Africa and the Middle East, reported The Financial Times.

It was has been reported that the U.S. is investigating if Iraqi fighters have missiles able to bring down a civilian aircraft.

Until the MH17 disaster, Emirates flew over eastern Ukraine along with Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa and Etihad Airways while Air France and British Airways were not.

Since moving its European hub from Singapore to Dubai last year, Qantas has avoided eastern Ukraine and stopped flying over Crimea in the country's south in April because of escalating conflict with Russia.

While Virgin Australia does not offer flights to Europe from Australia it does codeshare with Singapore Airlines and Etihad.

Qantas has been contacted for comment.
