Manchester United held on to record a 2-1 win over Everton in their Premier League clash at Old Trafford on Sunday.

Angel di Maria gave the home side a half-time lead before Steven Naismith headed in a Leighton Baines cross early in the second half to bring Everton level.

Radamel Falcao then scored the winner with his first goal for Manchester United, but Louis van Gaal's side needed a string of world-class saves from their goalkeeper David de Gea.

Find out how the players rated at Old Trafford here. 

MANCHESTER UNITED 

DAVID DE GEA - 8

Guessed correctly to save Baines’ penalty, the first Premier League keeper to do so, and then made two outstanding late saves. 

David de Gea denies Everton an equaliser in the final minute, one of his many important saves on the day

RAFAEL - 7

Made several vital interceptions and clearances, and also got forward well for the first goal.

PADDY McNAIR - 6.5

Couldn’t have had a tougher physical test than facing Romelu Lukaku but contained the Belgian’s threat in the main.

MARCOS ROJO - 6

Still feeling his way into the Premier League and looks a little uncomfortable, particularly on his right foot.

LUKE SHAW - 5.5

Had better days. Guilty of fouling Tony Hibbert for the penalty and then lost Steven Naismith for Everton’s goal. Went off injured.

Luke Shaw brought down Tony Hibbert in the penalty area to concede a first-half penalty

ANTONIO VALENCIA - 5

Did little to show that he can make the transition from traditional winger to playing on the right side of United’s midfield diamond. 

JUAN MATA - 5.5

Back in the line-up for the suspended Wayne Rooney but will be disappointed he didn’t make more of his opportunity.

Juan Mata was largely disappointing in an advanced midfield role for Manchester United

DALEY BLIND - 7

Another assured and tenacious display as United’s midfield anchor. Booked for second of two poor challenges on Naismith.

ANGEL DI MARIA - 7.5 

Fantastic finish for United’s first goal, had a hand in the second and shone throughout with some exquisite touches.

Angel di Maria gave Manchester United the lead midway through the first half at Old Trafford

RADAMEL FALCAO - 6 

Will be mightily relieved that he has his first goal for United because he wasted enough chances before that.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE - 5.5 

Still looks some way short of his best and has yet to strike up a proper partnership with Falcao.

Radamel Falcao restored Manchester United's lead with his first goal for the club

Subs: Januzaj, Lindegaard, Fletcher, Fellaini (for Valencia 79, 5.5), Thorpe, Blackett (for Shaw 71, 7), Wilson (for Falcao 73, 6).

Scorers: Di Maria 27, Falcao 62.

Booked: Van Persie, Blind, Valencia, Wilson.

EVERTON 

TIM HOWARD - 6

Former United keeper couldn’t be faulted for either goal and made a fine save to deny Di Maria a second.

TONY HIBBERT - 6.5

Had his hands full with Di Maria but got forward well to win the penalty in first-half injury-time.

JOHN STONES - 7 

Another accomplished performance from the young England centre-back and his late injury will be a concern for Roy Hodgson.

John Stones looked assured and comfortable once again in Everton's central defence

PHIL JAGIELKA - 6 

Unlucky that his fine clearance led to the first goal but lost track of Falcao for the second.

LEIGHTON BAINES - 6.5

Bound to be disappointed that he missed his first penalty in 15 attempts but wonderful cross for the goal.

Leighton Baines saw his first-half penalty saved by Manchester United goalkeeper De Gea

MUHAMED BESIC - 6

Did what he could to hold United’s forward at bay and booked for cynical foul on Falcao.

GARETH BARRY - 6

Had a hand in the goal but missed out on a great chance to snatch an equaliser at the death.

AIDEN McGEADY - 5.5 

Struggled to make an impression down the Everton right. Replaced towards the end.

STEVEN NAISMITH - 7 

Took his goal brilliantly and a constant handful for United arriving late on crosses.

Steven Naismith (right) headed in Everton's equaliser from a Leighton Baines cross early in the second half

STEVEN PIENAAR - 6 

Neat backheel that led to the penalty but went off injured having been booked for tripping Rafael.

ROMELU LUKAKU - 6 

Difficult task on his own up front. Created one chance with great takedown but blazed over.

Subs: Robles, Gibson, Eto’o, Oviedo (for Pienaar 63, 6), Osman (for McGeady 77, 6), Browning (for Hibbert 78, 6), Alcaraz

Scorer: Naismith 55.

Booked: Besic, Pienaar, Howard.

Star man: David de Gea 

Referee: Kevin Friend - 6.5

Louis van Gaal – 7

Roberto Martinez – 6.5
