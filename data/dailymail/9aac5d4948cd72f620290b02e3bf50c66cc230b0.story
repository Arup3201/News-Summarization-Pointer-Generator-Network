A 17-storey water slide is set to become the world's tallest, fastest and steepest when it opens next year.

Riders of the Verruckt - German for Insane - will be sent down in four-person inflatable rafts at more than 65mph.

Bosses at the Kansas City water park Schlitterbahn promise their ride will beat the current water slide record holders.

Vertigo inducing: The Verruckt has been certified by Guinness as the world's tallest water slide

'Game changer': The 17-storey drop will beat the current record of 134.5ft held by a Brazilian slide

Huge: The enormous slide is being built at water park Schlitterbahn in Kansas City

The park has released vertigo-inducing pictures of the giant slide being built on site.

The slide's drop is so steep, it is almost at a right-angle to the ground.

Thrill-seekers will need to climb 264 steps to reach the top where they will wait on a deck made from railroad tanker cars.

They will then be sent hurtling down into the pool below. 

The exact height of the Verruckt has not being revealed but bosses say it will be taller than the current record holder, the 134.5ft Insano slide in Fortaleza, Brazil.

Under construction: The slide is being built and is due to open in May 2014 when it will be officially measured

Thrilling: Once at the bottom of the huge drop, riders are then sent up a second five-storey hill

Verruckt's height will be officially measured next year before its May opening date.

Larry Pitcher, the park's director of marketing and sales, told The Kansas City Star: 'We have always been family friendly, but this will attract those adrenaline junkies who are always lookingf or that next biggest, coolest thrill.'

The rafts will drop more than 130ft before being sent up another five-storey tall hump and then down again into the pool.

Mr Picther said: 'At Schlitterbahn we 
love rides that encourage people to share the experience. Besides it’s 
more fun if someone is screaming in your ear.'

Big climb: Riders will ascend more than 260 steps to reach the top deck made from railroad cars

Building momentum: The water park released a video of the first stages of the construction work

Current record holder: Schlitterbahn bosses promise their ride will be higher than the Guinness Book of Records official tallest water ride of Insano in Brazil

The ride was designed by Schlitterbahn co-owner Jeff Henry who said it will be a 'game changer' for the industry.

He has also created pioneering rides including the uphill water slide. 

Last year, the Gunness Book of Records listed Brazil's Insano as the world's tallest.

Equivalent in height to a 14-storey building, the ride plunges swimmers from sky to pool in just four or five seconds travelling at speeds of around 65 miles an hour.

Constructed in 1989, the thrill ride attracts daredevils from all over the world.
