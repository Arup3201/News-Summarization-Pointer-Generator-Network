Celtic midfielder Kris Commons believes they can go from strength to strength after winning the first trophy of Ronny Deila's reign.

Deila is on course to become only the third Celtic manager to win a domestic treble, after Jock Stein and Martin O'Neill, following his side's League Cup triumph on Sunday.

That added a new medal to Commons' cabinet but the playmaker is not about to rest on his laurels ahead of the William Hill Scottish Cup quarter-final replay against Dundee United at Parkhead.

The 31-year-old appeared likely to leave the club in January as former Celtic manager Neil Lennon targeted him for a move to Bolton but the former Scotland international went on to sign a two-year contract before netting the opener against United at Hampden on Sunday.

And he is fully embracing Deila's quest to improve his team and players.

Commons said: 'I think we're a better team than last season. On paper we set really high standards with the clean sheet record, goals scored and points tally. I think this time last season the league was done and dusted. It's hard to say we are a better team but I feel like we are in a better place.

'We've not reached the top. It's not like we've conquered it and that's where we need to be, we will still be looking to make improvements and progress year-in, year-out.

'If we do win the treble we will be looking to do it again next year and the year after then add Champions League group stages and try to get last-16.

'You've got to keep striving for greatness. If you think you've reached the top and stand still that's when you start going backwards.'

Commons, who admitted his own season had been a 'rollercoaster', added: 'When a new manager comes in, it's very difficult to make it seamless. He is a different nationality, we had a few new players and we weren't achieving the style of play he wanted. Changes take time and now we are seeing the benefits.'

Commons' words were music to Deila's ears as the Norwegian continues to wipe out early impressions of him following Celtic's poor Champions League qualifying campaign.

'I think we have progressed a lot in the things I want to bring into the culture and how we want to work,' he said.

'I'm starting to really enjoy it. In the beginning it's enough to be there, you don't know where to start. Now it's settled, everybody knows their role and what's expected, and now we have to work better than we have done before.

'There is so much to go but that will never stop. But we have done a good job so far and we just have to keep working in the same way, and I think we will get even better results.

'When you are at a club like Celtic, the pressure is so unbelievably high so everybody in the club is always thinking about results. And that's the wrong way of thinking in my opinion, but it's very hard not to do it.

'So everything has been an environment that's all about results, then you don't get any creativity because you are so afraid to do something different. To get that culture of development, to get people to get into what to do every day and try to improve things, that has been the biggest challenge for me.

'Winning and developing, individually and as a team, I think we are getting that message across. People understand that we want to get the best out of them and the players are getting very interested in doing the things to improve themselves.

'It's all about tempo. They are much lighter, as a team we have dropped 50 kilos in six months. That's a lot. Things are getting quicker and sharper in training. It's not only a physical thing, it's also a tactical thing that you have to work in the intensity you want to play, maybe higher.'

Deila is not about to make major changes to freshen things up in the third of their four consecutive matches against United.

'If you are good at something you have to continue doing what you are good at, not start doing something else,' he said.

'We want to build on what we are good at and do that even better. I'm not into surprising opponents so much. I want them to fear us for what we are - they know what's coming and don't know how to handle it. That's our goal in the future.'
