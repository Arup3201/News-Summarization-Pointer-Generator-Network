Nigel Lithman QC sparked fury after he appeared to compare legal aid cuts to the horrors of  Nazi Germany

A senior lawyer sparked fury last night after he appeared to compare legal aid cuts to the horrors of  Nazi Germany.

Nigel Lithman QC condemned a London conference to promote the British legal sector overseas, saying it was ridiculous for the event to boast of the ‘UK’s unrivalled legal expertise’ when funding for criminal cases is being cut.

He added that it was ‘like inviting the Red Cross in to Theresienstadt to see what great camps the Germans truly ran’. The Second World War camp was used by the Nazis to showcase how well they treated prisoners – thereby disguising the horrors taking place at sites such as Auschwitz.

Mr Lithman, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, represents barristers who stand to lose out when fees for court cases are cut. He received more than £250,000 in fees from the legal aid budget last year.

In a speech to lawyers he said the cuts would ‘destroy the criminal bar’. But his mention of a Nazi camp where tens of thousands died provoked outrage and was labelled ‘deeply offensive’ by Tory MP Michael Ellis.

Last night Mr Lithman, who is Jewish, denied comparing the ‘dismantling’ of the criminal justice system with the ‘horrors of the Holocaust’.

‘There is of course no comparison with the evils of Theresienstadt, but what happened there is the Red Cross were invited to look at a “model” camp in which they were fooled that all was well,’ he said.

‘The point I make is you always have a duty to look beneath the surface to discover for yourself what in reality is going on.’

Speaking at a London conference to promote the British legal sector overseas, he said it was ridiculous for the event to boast of the 'UK's unrivalled legal expertise' when funding for criminal cases is being cut. He added that it was 'like inviting the Red Cross in to Theresienstadt to see what great camps the Germans truly ran'
