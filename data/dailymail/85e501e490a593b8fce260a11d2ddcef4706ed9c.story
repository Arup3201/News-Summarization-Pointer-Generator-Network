Supermodel Karlie Kloss has admitted that she has so many beauty products, a bathroom isn't enough to contain them.

The 21-year-old Victoria's Secret Angel, who appears in the July issue of ELLE reveals: 'I have a whole second bedroom filled with products, but I stick to the things that work.'

She adds: 'I like products that streamline my morning routine. Sunday Riley has a really good foundation; it’s very velvety. I love RMS “Un” Cover-Up for under eyes or on a blemish.'

She also credits Living Proof shampoo and conditioner, for making her hair 'bounce in a different way,' and mentions that Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer is also 'good.'

And as for her body, the statuesque six-foot-one model, who flaunts her toned physique in an array of Nike sportswear, says that when she is traveling, she brings 'two or three-pound ankle weights 
and resistance bands' along with her, and favors the privacy of
 her hotel room over the gym.

'Sometimes
 I get a better workout staying in my room and forcing myself to do half
 an hour or even 15 minutes versus going to the gym, she says. 'Before I
 leave for work, I try to do something. It helps me feel better for the 
rest of the day.'

Miss Kloss also mentions her Nike Training Club app - which features workouts for women - as helpful in keeping her active.

'[It's]
 a lot more convenient than a personal trainer,' she says, adding that

even than her email.

The Pilates enthusiast, who was a trained ballet dancer in her youth, recently spoke to Into The Gloss about her passion for fitness, saying:

'I treat myself more as an athlete than just a model. I love to challenge myself physically and mentally.

Always prepared: The lithe supermodel brings 'two or three-pound ankle weights and resistance bands' with her on her travels, so she can fit exercise in around her busy schedule

She added: 'But I'm not a professional athlete, I'm not a professional dancer, I'm not a professional anything; I have never considered modelling an actual job title.'

Miss Kloss, who is based in New York and is dating 29-year-old entrepreneur Joshua Kushner, hinted last year that she was looking to expand her professional interests, telling The Daily:

'I feel fortunate to have an incredible career and experiences behind me but there is so much more that I want to do with this career and with my life.

Hardcore: Miss Kloss recently said in a separate interview, 'I treat myself more as an athlete than just a model. I love to challenge myself physically and mentally'

'Now that I am getting more and more involved in these entrepreneurial projects I think business is something that would also be fascinating.

'To have a better understanding of economics and business, and the way to run a successful company.'

The Chicago-born model recently completed a short course at the Harvard Business School, and runs a gluten-free baking company called Karlie's Kookies.
