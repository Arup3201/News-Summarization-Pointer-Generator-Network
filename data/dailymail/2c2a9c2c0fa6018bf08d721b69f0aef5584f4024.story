This is the dramatic moment a builder was rescued by fire crews after he became trapped 18ft down a hole and was buried under two tonnes of soil.

The workman, aged in his 20s, was found buried neck-deep in rubble, his head poking out from a spot of land earmarked for new homes.

Firefighters and ambulance crews battled 
to free the man, who has not been named, during a rescue operation that 
lasted two and a half hours.

Emergency services were called to the building site in Bearwood, Birmingham, after the worker got stuck in the trench on Monday afternoon.

He was finally lifted to safety at around 4.50pm and was rushed to the city’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital with chest and pelvic injuries.

West Midlands Ambulance Service said he had been working on the site when one side of the ground above caved in on top of him at around 2.20pm.

'Crews were called to reports of a man who had become trapped in a trench that he had been working in,' said an ambulance spokesman.

'It is believed that one of the sides collapsed in on the hole, which was approximately 18 feet deep.

'On arrival at the scene crews could only see the man’s head.

'Ambulance personnel quickly dug away some of the earth to help free the man.

'Emergency services worked closely together for over two and a half hours to extricate the man safely from the trench.

'Crews used specialist stretcher equipment and a hoist to finally release him from the hole.'

The spokesman said the man was taken to the hospital's major trauma centre for further assessment and treatment, and that a trauma doctor had travelled with him on board the ambulance as paramedics continued to treat him.

A spokesman from West Midlands Fire Service said they sent two crews from nearby Smethwick and Woodgate Valley, as well as a Technical Rescue Unit.

He added: 'We were called at around 2pm on Monday following reports a man had become trapped in a trench.

'We managed to free him after two and a half hours using specialist stretcher equipment after two tonnes of soil had fallen on him.

'He was then taken to hospital where he was treated for his injuries.'

Witness Alfie Lowton, 22, said: 'They did a great job - having that much pressure on your body should be catastrophic. They worked fast and kept him calm.

'After he was carried away we were told he is going to be OK - its a miracle really.'
