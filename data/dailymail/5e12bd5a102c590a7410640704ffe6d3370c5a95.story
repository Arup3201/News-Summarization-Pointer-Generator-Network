Caught in the act: Tajreed Rich was arrested after the father of a 17-year-old student found him naked in her bedroom

A high school hall monitor has been arrested after being caught naked with a student by the 17-year-old girl's father.

The 41-year-old, who worked at Robbinsdale Cooper High School in Minneapolis, was charged with sexual assault on Friday, after the girl's father returned home early and discovered the man in his daughter's bedroom.

After hearing strange noises, the father walked into his daughter's bedroom and saw a naked Tajreed Rich standing over his daughter, who was naked on her bed.

The father, who has not been named, recognized Rich from the school and the family called police later that day.

Rich, who had counseled students at the high school about relationships and had previously helped coach a cheer leading squad at a different school, was fired by Robbinsdale Cooper on Monday.

The teenager, who has not been named, alleges that she had intercourse with Rich twice.

He confirmed this to police, telling them they had sex once at his home and once at her house. Rich added that he did not use a condom on either occasion, according to Fox9.

The hall monitor described the girl as a 'vulnerable student', and said he knew he should not have had a sexual relationship with a student.

The school had ended for the summer vacation on Wednesday, but a voice mail message was sent to parents on Friday confirming that Rich, who had worked at the school for more than two years, had been arrested. 

A Robbinsdale Cooper High School statement said: 'This is a horrible incident, and the 
district finds acts such as this reprehensible. The safety and 
well-being of our students is our top priority, and our hearts go out to
the family during this time.'

At a conference about the incident, County Attorney Mike Freeman said: '[It's] a tragedy for any father [who] comes home and finds his daughter in bed with another man'.

'He’s 41, she’s 17 ... He’s a hall monitor. I mean, the charge here is a position of authority. I think parents have a right to expect when their kids are at school that people employed at that school are not going to mess with their daughters, or sons, for that matter,' he told the StarTribune.

Rich had first started working in schools as an education assistant in 1995.

Minneapolis school district spokesman Larissa Chinwah added: 'Rich was rehired in 
the same position in January 1998. In 1999, Rich was a security monitor.
From 2003 until 2010, Rich held positions of youth coordinator, parent 
liaison and coach at North High School.'

Rich is being held in Hennepin County Jail on third-degree criminal sexual conduct.

If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison and a $30,000 fine, CBS Minnesota said.
