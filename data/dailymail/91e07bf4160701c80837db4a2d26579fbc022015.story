For extra class she is joined by Broadwalk Empire star Michael K. Williams and Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss and Peggy Olsen. Plus Jena Malone from The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Zosia Mamet whoi starred in TV series Girls.

With the host of top names the classic fashion company says it is celebrating the 'individuality and authenticity of personal style by questioning what it means to 'Dress Normal'.

The collection aims to celebrate being  confident in dressing comfortably and the instruction to 'Dress Normal' as part of its tagline sends the message that stylistas everywhere should dress for themselves.

Gap Global Chief Marketing Officer, Seth Farbman, said: 'Finding your own version of 'dress normal' is an art, my normal is different from your normal, and that's the essence of the campaign.

'This fall, Gap celebrates dressing for yourself and finding those perfect items-a pair of jeans, a t-shirt-that make you feel confident to be your most authentic self.'

The campaign features photography of celebrities who the brand believes are well known for their own art of dressing normal, such as actress Anjelica Huston and actor Michael K. Williams.
