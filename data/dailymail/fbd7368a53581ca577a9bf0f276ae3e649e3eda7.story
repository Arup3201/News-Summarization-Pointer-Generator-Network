Lindsey Vonn broke down in tears after being disqualified from a world championship run in front of her home crowd in Beaver Creek, Colorado.

The four-time world champion - famous for her relationship to Tiger Woods - bravely smiled and waved to her adoring fans but her sadness spilled over when she was out of view.

Vonn, 30, was the gold medal favourite in the Alpine combined race which contains elements of downhill and slalom skiing.

But she crumbled under the intense pressure and recorded a 'did not finish' after straddling a gate in the slalom section - meaning her FIS Alpine World Cup run counted for nothing.

Intense pressure: 30-year-old Vonn's sadness eventually spilled over and she could barely convey her disappointment in an emotional post-race interview

Barely able to speak, she said afterwards: 'It's the hometown championship and I really tried as hard as I could and I just - I came up short and that's disappointing for myself and for my family and for my fans.

'I just didn't figure out this hill at all and I was especially disappointed today because I actually skied a really good slalom the last few days and I thought I had a chance of getting a medal.'

The professional skier posted a defiant picture on her Instagram account hours after her failed run.

It features a picture of the winter athlete in tight, black sportswear alongside the caption: 'Even if you have setbacks and you have bad days, you have to believe in yourself that things are going to turn around.'

Vonn was looking forward to this event in her backyard, where boyfriend Tiger Woods came as a spectator last week.

She had to pull out of the Sochi Winter Olympics last year after suffering a potentially career-threatening knee injury in January 2014.

And Vonn  has struggled to find her rhythm on the difficult course because its very icy and she claims 'doesn't 'really feel good on my knee'.

Her hometown race was eventually won by Slovenia's Tina Maze, who empathised with the pressure Vonn was under.

She said: 'I know exactly what the feeling is like when things are not going the way you want to.

'It happened to me. It happened to everybody. When you're going through that, you need to trust in yourself.'

Vonn has a final chance to claim a gold medal in front of her home fans on Thursday when she takes part in the giant slalom event.

But she knows it will take a 'miracle', since it's not one of her stronger disciplines these days.

She said: 'Just try to forget today as fast as possible and move on to the next race.'
