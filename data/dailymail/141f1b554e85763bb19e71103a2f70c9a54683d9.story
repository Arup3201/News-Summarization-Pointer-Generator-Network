Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on Monday that there is 'absolutely no evidence' that the United States will lose jobs as a consequence of implementing the Affordable Care Act.

But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office declared on February 4 that the Obamacare law would suck the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time jobs out of the U.S. economy by 2024.

'There is absolutely no evidence, and every economist will tell you this, that there is any job loss related to the Affordable Care Act,' Sebelius insisted Monday in Florida.

U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius continues to plug the Affordable Care act, claiming that it won't reduce employment

The HHS chief and former Kansas governor had at least 17 conversations with president and other White House bigwigs leading up to the Obamacare system's disastrous launch, it emerged last week

'Part-time positions are actually down since 2010, not up,' she noted. 'The number of full-time workers continues to increase. I know that’s a popular myth that continues to be repeated but it just is not accurate.'

But the CBO projected something dramatically different, concluding that so many Americans would stop working that the U.S. workforce would shrink by millions.

On February 10 Vice President Biden seemed to agree with what Sebelius would say a week later, telling TIME that 'there is zero evidence that this is costing people jobs now.'

The White House immediately spun the CBO report as good news, saying that those 'choices' reflected new flexibility for Americans who will soon be able to keep their health insurance without going to work every day.

And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi claimed that 'it's not going to cost jobs. It's going to shift how people make a living and reach their aspirations.'

'This was one of the goals' of the Affordable Care Act,' she added.

Sebelius could have worded her statement differently, saying that Obamacare wouldn't drive employers to hire fewer people.

But by choosing to say there would not be 'any job loss,' she has left herself open to attacks from Republican members of Congress who are growing impatient with the Obama administration's handling of the law's implementation.

The president hasn't directly addressed the CBO report about Obamacare job losses, but his spokesmen have spun it as a positive when working Americans can make the 'choice' to leave their employment

The White House has already announced 29 unilateral changes, many of which contradict the plain text of the Affordable Care Act.

'This is going to drive Capitol Hill conservatives nuts,' a Republican campaign operative in Louisiana told MailOnline on Tuesday.

'This year's election is a referendum on Obamacare,' he said. 'It's bad enough that the White House is playing emperor in order to keep the law from a death spiral, but now the woman in charge doesn't seem to understand how bad it's going to be for the economy.'

HHS did not respond to questions about how Sebelius' statement could be reconciled with the facts the CBO has put on the record.

But some in Congress had already piled on the notion that Obamacare will cost jobs.

'Just like when the president promised, ‘"f you like your plan you can keep it," those in the Administration who promised that Obamacare wouldn't negatively impact the job market couldn't have been more wrong,' Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul wrote in an essay for the Breitbart.com blog.

And Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that the White House seemed to believe 'that it’s a good thing to discourage people from working.'
