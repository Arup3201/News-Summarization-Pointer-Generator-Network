Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry compared legal U.S. immigrants to cardboard boxes on Saturday, bringing some in a Des Moines, Iowa audience to shake their head sin disbelief..

He said at the Iowa Ag Summit, a testing ground for potential presidential candidates, that the United States should be able to track holders of work visas the way shipping companies track parcels.

'I'm telling you,' Perry said, 'if UPS can track a box all around the world and know exactly where it is 24/7, we can give people a card and allow them in here, and say that when you hit your visa limit from the time to be in this country, we're going to know where you are.'

'We're going to let you know that your time's up. You're outta here.'

'YOU'RE OUTTA HERE': Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said the US government should track foreign guest workers like UPS tracks packages and deport them when their permits expire

SCAN IT: UPS keeps track of millions of packages around the world every day, far more than the hundreds of thousands of H1-B immigrants in the country legally at any given time

While some applauded, others grimaced.

Most speakers during the morning session had harsh words for President Barack Obama's recent immigration executive actions, which promise to guarantee 5 million or more illegal immigrants that they won't be deported through the end of his White House term.

But Perry distinguished himself by saying future presidents should embrace greater numbers of targeted legal immigrants.

He hinted that a Perry administration in Washington would focus on 'bringing people into this country that we need, whether it's high-tech workers, or people in agriculture, hospitality or construction.'

And, he added, the government would have to be 'able to identify these people – keep up with them.'

Perry didn't say what kind of technology he advocated for keeping track of legal immigrants.

America awards 85,000 so-called H-1B work visas, based on a computer-generated lottery system, including 20,000 with advanced academic qualifications like master's degrees or Ph.Ds.

Last year the U.S. got 172,500 applications for fiscal 2015, and stopped acceepting them after just 7 days.

The visa allows foreign nationals who do not intend to emigrate to the United States to work inside the country for three years, extendable to six.

Many choose ultimately to stay beyond that timeframe – including all of the airline hijackers responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001.

According to a recent U.S. Customs and Immigration Services report to Congress, 61 per cent of the successful applicants in 2012 worked in 'computer-related occupations.' Other categories include 'specialty occupations' such as fashion modeling and healthcare work.

That year visa holders' salaries averaged $79,000.

Nearly three-quarters were between the ages of 25 and 34 that year. All told there were moew than 262,500 H1-B visa holders in the country in 2012, including holdovers from previous years.

Perry also hammered the Obama administration for appointing Ron Klain as his Ebola czar – 'a political spokesperson for Al Gore!'

And he complained that America's longest border with Mexico, in his home state of Texas, has been left largely undefended during the Obama years.

'I've got some experience with this,' he said.

Tickets to legally enter the United States include 'H1-B' visas that allow holders to work in America for three years at a time

Describing a 150-mile wide swath of southern Texas, he said that when Obama visited Texas in July 2014, that area was seeing '10,000-plus apprehensions a week.'

The president, he recalled, has emphasized 'securing the border' as part of a comprehensive approach to immigration reform.

'We've heard that time after time after time,' he said.

Perry also noted that the president

None of the high profile Democrats who were invited – including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton – made the trip.
