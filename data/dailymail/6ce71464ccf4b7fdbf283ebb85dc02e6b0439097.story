Police chiefs will spend 3,00 hours and £64,000 obtaining statements from 800 police officers over the Plebgate row.

Every officer in the elite SO6 diplomatic protection group will be questioned over their knowledge of the affair, which led to the resignation of Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell.

A team of 30 officers from the Metropolitan Police's Directorate of Professional Standards are investigating if there was a conspiracy against Mr Mitchell, according to the Daily Mirror.

The probe called Operation Alice,will ask the officers if they fabricated evidence or leaked evidence to the press.

The row was sparked when an officer told Mr Mitchell to get off his bike as he left Downing Street. Officers say that Mr Mitchell called them 'f****** plebs', but the then-Chief Whip denies the use of the word 'plebs'.

Last month 52-year-old Keith Wallis, a diplomatic protection group officer, was arrested on a misconduct charge over claims he sent an email to an MP, falsely claiming 
to be a member of the public who witnessed the row while passing Downing
Street with his nephew.

Labour MP Steve McCabe said: 'It seems an awful lot of resources are being used when it would be much simpler if Andrew Mitchell just came clean and told us exactly what did happen.

'This is all at a time of cuts in police budgets and when terrorists are being allowed to slip away because of Government incompetence.'

CCTV footage cast doubt on police officer Toby Rowland's account of the 'Plebgate' incident. The footage showed Mr Rowland ushering Mr Mitchell out of a side gate at Downing Street but showed no evidence of a row

Another source quoted by the paper called the investigation a 'witch hunt'.

The Metropolitan Police says the aim of Operation Alice is to 'investigate the circumstances surrounding the Police Officer's claim to have witnessed the incident in Downing Street, to establish if there is any evidence of a conspiracy between this officer and any other person [and] establish what, if any, criminal or misconduct offences are apparent.'

A spokesman for the force said: 'The allegations in relation to this matter are extremely serious and it is therefore vital that a thorough and proportionate investigation is carried out.

'The investigation continues to be progressed with urgency, determination and an open mind.

'We are not prepared to discuss who we may or may not want to speak to in relation to any investigation.'
