The England players were put through their paces on Tuesday ahead of their penultimate Six Nations game against Scotland at the weekend.

Stuart Lancaster's men are looking to bounce back from the disappointing defeat by Ireland with victory at Twickenham.

And the players returned to the Bagshot training field and looked relaxed, facing a Scotland side who are looking to avoid a Six Nations wooden spoon having lost their opening three games.

Graham Rowntree has demanded a reaction from England having finally come to terms with the defeat by Ireland

Graham Rowntree has demanded a reaction from England  having finally come to terms with a chastening defeat by Ireland.

A 19-9 loss in Dublin has left the red rose on the periphery of the RBS 6 Nations title picture, needing Wales to intervene by beating the reigning champions in Cardiff this weekend.

It was an alarming performance at the Aviva Stadium just five matches out from the World Cup with a pack that has excelled over the last year failing to cover itself in glory.

Forwards coach Rowntree expects Scotland to feel the full force of England's anguish when the Championship enters its penultimate round.

'There is lots we have to put right because the Ireland game was immensely frustrating and disappointing,' Rowntree said. 'I've just got over it, if I'm honest. We had a long week last week pulling it apart.

'We're playing a team at Twickenham who have just lost at home and have a lot to prove themselves. I expect a reaction from us. We have an honest group of lads and we're not satisfied at all with that performance. But we have this week to put it right.'

The pack were subdued against Ireland, lacking the Celts' ferocity as they came off worse in just about every department of the game.

He added: 'We just couldn't get our game going and that comes down to a multitude of reasons. Ill-discipline was one. It was a very good Ireland performance. They stifled our game and fair play, the best team won.

'The way they quickly amassed points on the scoreboard was frustrating, but at half time we were still very much in the game.

'It was a clinical performance from Ireland, but we came back strongly and that was important. If we'd had more opportunities to play in that area of the field then the result could have been different.'

A full England squad trained on Tuesday, including Mike Brown, while Exeter Chiefs centre Henry Slade has been called up as midfield cover after Brad Barritt was ruled out of the remaining two rounds by a sprained ankle.

'The more I see him, the more I think he's got fantastic potential. I've always known it having seen him come through the age-group teams,' Lancaster said about the 21-year-old.

Only a late flurry of injuries would see Slade plunged into action in the Calcutta Cup match at Twickenham.

Following their 19-9 defeat by Ireland in Dublin,  Lancaster's men held a debrief last week at their five-star Pennyhill Park retreat in Surrey and the video analysis made for uncomfortable viewing.
