A brand new £440,000 ($800,000) Lamborghini unexpectedly went up in flames while the luxury Italian company was exhibiting its supercar at a media demonstration in Australia.

Witnesses reported that the light blue V12-powered Aventador LP700-4 Roadster had completed dozens of laps around Phillip Island race track in Victoria when heavy smoke along with fire emerged from behind the cabin.

Driving the sports car was Top Gear Australia editor Tim Keen who was quickly instructed to stop on the track and leave the vehicle, while a driving instructor was heard desperately yelling for people to grab fire extinguishers off the walls of the pit bays nearby.

Embarrassing: The fire was caused by oil from the brake lines leaking onto the exhaust

Sources told Fairfax Media that 'a number' of fire extinguishers were needed to put out the fire, which is believed to have started due to an oil leak in the exhaust and spread to the rear taillight.

It is understood oil from one of the brake lines leaked on the exhaust system and caught fire.

A statement released by Lamborghini explained that the blaze was caused by the vehicle's 'extended track use in a high-temperature environment' and they consequently have no plans to modify the car.

'The investigation has also confirmed that the issue was not due to any fault in the design or construction of the vehicle,' the statement read.

The Italian car-maker was further embarrassed when Lamborghini's head of south-east Asia and the Pacific, Sebastien Henry, asked media attending not to write about the incident or report about it on social media.

At least one media outlet was allegedly asked to delete video footage and images of the 515kW Aventador burning.

But Mr Henry denied the company forced anyone to wipe the footage.

'We certainly did not force any of our guests to delete imagery obtained on the day,' he said in a statement.

'We did, however, kindly request that our guests refrain from making any assumptions through the media – particularly when, at the time, the cause of the incident had not been adequately investigated.'

The car had been shipped exclusively from Italy to Australia for a number of demonstration and drive days.

It's believed it was to be flown to the Beijing motor show after a stint down under but it has instead been sent to the repair shop.
