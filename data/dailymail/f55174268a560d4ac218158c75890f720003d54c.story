BBC presenter Andrew Marr is far from being back to full health after suffering a stroke in January last year, his wife said

To viewers, he seems well on the way to an extraordinary recovery. But nearly 18 months on from a catastrophic stroke, Andrew Marr is far from being back to full health, his wife revealed yesterday.

Jackie Ashley said the BBC presenter still has hardly any movement in his left arm, while he uses a stick to walk because his left leg is still weak.

Speaking on ITV1’s Lorraine show, Miss Ashley said: ‘He’s fine but he’s a long way off being fully recovered. He can’t do a lot of the things he used to do, he can’t run, he can’t ride a bicycle.’

Marr, 54, suffered the stroke as he worked out on a rowing machine in his garden shed in East Sheen, West London, in January last year but did not call for an ambulance until the following day.

Journalist Miss Ashley, who now campaigns on behalf of the Stroke Association, was warned that he was unlikely to survive.

But after two months in hospital, Marr showed his determination by making a guest appearance on his BBC1 show weeks later. He returned as host in September.

Mother-of-three Miss Ashley, 59, who married Marr in 1987, said he is frustrated at being unable to do some of his favourite things.

‘It’s very hard, he’s horrendously independent and will keep trying to do things,’ she said. ‘He’s even bought a tricycle now because he’s so determined to get back on a bike.

‘He’s very determined which is great. It 
was quite an upward learning curve. There’s not a lot of help out there 
for people suddenly in that situation.’

Earlier this year, Marr revealed doctors had told him he had suffered two previous ‘mini strokes’ – transient ischaemic attacks – which he dismissed as ‘funny turns’.

Marr, 54, was left with seriously impaired mobility down his left side after tearing an artery in his neck.

He suffered bleeding on the brain, causing a ‘blinding headache and flashes of light’ but did not call for an ambulance until the following day. He spent two months in hospital.

Miss 
Ashley said: ‘On one occasion he was trying to do a piece to camera for a
 film he was making and he said he couldn’t get the words out which is 
very unusual for him.

‘His mouth wouldn’t seem to work properly so 
he just went to lie down, had the afternoon off [and] later in the day 
he went back and did the piece to camera and thought “Oh well I was just
 feeling off colour”.’
