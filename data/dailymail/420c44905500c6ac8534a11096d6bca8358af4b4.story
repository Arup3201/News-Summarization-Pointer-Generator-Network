Gemma Cawte , pictured left with her five-month-old son Jack, was stunned after cafe staff tried to charge her 80p for a jug of hot tap water to warm her baby's milk

A furious mother has hit out after a council-run café tried to charge her 80p for a jug of hot tap water to warm her baby’s milk.

Gemma Cawte had already spent £9.60 on lunch for herself and her daughter Bella, five, on an outing to Riverside Country Park in Gillingham, Kent.

But when the 31-year-old asked staff at the café for some water to warm the milk for her five-month-old son Jack, she was told it would cost 80p.

Ms Cawte had spent all her money buying lunch and was forced to feed the milk cold to the tiny baby - and the youngster promptly threw it up.

Medway Council says the cafe is run under a lease agreement and that it has no control over the pricing.

But civic chiefs have asked for the people that run it to reconsider charging for warming baby bottles.

Ms Cawte, of Chattenden, Kent, said: 'I asked for some hot water and they said they couldn’t give me any because of health and safety.

'When I asked if they could put it in some hot water behind the counter instead.

'I was told I would have to pay 80p, the same price as a cup of tea. We had only taken £10 out with us.

'It is madness. I thought they would have been more helpful considering it was a family place.

'The woman in the cafe wasn’t apologetic at all. She just looked at me and said no she couldn’t do it.

'I was angry and upset. I had to give him it cold and he just ended up puking all over me.’

A
 spokesman for Medway Council said: 'The cafe is run under a lease 
agreement and the council has no control over what they charge.

'Since 
this has been brought to our attention we have contacted the cafe and 
asked them to reconsider charging for the warming of baby bottles.'

Ms Cawte, who was with her partner Stuart Boyle, 32, and their two children, later said she was pleased to hear about the changes.

She added: 'I am pleased to hear that the council has asked them to stop charging as they should have a free bottle-warming facility.'

When MailOnline called the cafe a member of staff said they had been told not to comment.
