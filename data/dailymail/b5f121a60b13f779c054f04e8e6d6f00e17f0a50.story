Alan Barlow arriving at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court where he was given a conditional discharge after being pictured carrying an unexploded bomb

Two men caught on camera casually carrying two unexploded bombs away from a beach in Dorset have been prosecuted by the Ministry of Defence.

Alan Barlow, 71 and Jason Kelly, 33, were pictured with the two potentially deadly rusty 120mm tank shells slung over their shoulders.

Onlookers watched as the men strolled past them with the explosives, which date back to the Cold War, before loading the 2ft bombs into their cars and driving away.

The men discovered the ordnance washed up at Warbarrow Bay, a coastal beauty spot on the south coast.

The area is part of a 7,000-acre Lulworth Military Range in Dorset, which is used by the Army for tank firing practise.

The MoD launched an investigation into the incident, urging the two men to come forward so the bombs could be safely disposed of.

Barlow contacted military police and both men were charged with possession of a projectile and removing it from the danger area without lawful authority under local bylaws.

Bournemouth Magistrates' Court heard that Barlow and his daughter’s fiance Kelly, removed the shells fearing that children might play with them.

Jonathan Morrissey, defending, said the two men saw a group of children playing by the clifftop.

He said: 'They noticed a pile of disused shells, maybe half a dozen or more.

'They were clearly not live because of the presence of concrete.

'They
made the decision to put the shells in the car, he was public spirited 
in an inappropriate way. There is no nefarious or sinister intent here.

'There are notices with regard to local bylaws but Mr Barlow and his colleagues were not in a position to see them.'

Barlow and his son-in-law Jason Kelly said they picked up the unexploded bombs, which are thought to date from the Cold War, fearing children nearby might play with them

Barlow appeared in court and pleaded guilty to the charge. Kelly, who did not attend the hearing, posted his guilty verdict.

Both men were given an absolute discharge and were ordered to pay £85 each in costs.

A woman who took the picture of the pair on her mobile phone at the time, said: 'I thought they were carrying rugs at first but as they walked past I saw they were enormous shells.

'I was with somebody who used to be in the Army and he said that because their ends were intact, they were unexploded.

'I was really scared. As they were walking past, my little girl was alongside them. I just think they're a pair of idiots.'

Another person said: 'What a couple of twits. If you see anything like this you should always call the police, not cart it on home.'

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the shells would have probably been fired from a Chieftain tank

Speaking at the time a spokesman for the MoD said the shells would have probably been fired from a Chieftain tank or a Wombat anti-tank rifle used by the Army in the 70s and 80s.

He said: 'These shells have swiftly been recovered and we would like to urge the public using the ranges to keep to the designated pathways and remember that it is potentially extremely dangerous to touch any military material they may find.

‘We take the safety of the public extremely seriously and all pathways at Lulworth Ranges that are open to the public are cleared of military debris, including shells, before access is permitted.

‘A number of signs have been placed on-site warning members of the public of the dangers of venturing from authorised pathways and removing shells. Unfortunately there are instances where these warnings are ignored.’
