A team of 16 talented bakers have completed the Great British Bug Off - aiming to create a jungle made of cake.

The dung beetles look worthy of a Bushtucker Trial but they are all edible creations made from cake, icing and gelatine.

Even the flowers and branches that they are perched on are edible delicacies created by baker Vicki Smith, 26, from Flintshire, and her colleagues.

The individual bakes come together to form an unbelievably realistic and detailed (and totally edible!) jungle, which will be exhibited at The Cake and Bake Show 2014 this weekend

While this cut-in-half bug may not look particularly appetizing, it is in fact crafted out of a variety of delicious sweet materials

The group of 16 of the most talented bakers across the UK and the US have created a jungle made entirely of cake which includes realistic Dung beetles which don't look out of place next to real leaves 

They have been created after thousands of hours of painstaking work for an event in Manchester this weekend.

Each
 dung beetle, no more than four inches long, took days to complete, 
while some of the more complicated items took even longer.

They
 will be part of a display featuring at least a dozen beetles as well as
 flowers, branches and even a leopard cub, although the leopard has not 
yet been completed.

For
 the insects she made a chocolate cake mould with edible blood from 
condensed milk sugar, food colouring and a raspberry chambord liquor 
with the wings made out of gelatine.

She
 also made 100 flowers made including hibiscus and frangipani as well as 
creating the leopard cubs by sculpting and moulding sponge cake together with 
jam and buttercream.

The jungle scene, called Welcome to the Jungle, has been created by the group of 16 bakers that call themselves Cakebomb and are exhibiting at The Cake and Bake Show 2014 this weekend.

The Cakebomb group was set up by Francesca Pitcher of North Star Cakes.

The jungle required the intricate crafting of 100 flowers made from hibiscus and frangipani

Juggling her job as a ceramic designer with her passion, Vicki has only been entering baking competitions for 12 months, but still managed to create the stunning design

One member of the group, Vicki said: 'I met some of the other 
girls at the cake shows I attend regularly and we’ve made friends. They 
needed to replace people in the group to have enough people to take on 
the workload.

'They didn’t 
want just anyone, they wanted people who had talent, and that we are but
 we all have our strengths so we used that to our advantage.

'They
 approached me a few months back so it’s been hard catching up to 
everyone but I’ve made bugs for a photo shoot for the cake and bake 
promo. I’ve also made leaves, flowers, a tree and two snow leopard cubs.

'Some of the girls I haven’t even met in person yet so that will be exciting meeting new people.'

Juggling her job as a ceramic designer with her passion, Vicki has only been entering baking competitions for 12 months.

She
 first developed her passion for creating cakes when celebrating her 
lorry-driving boyfriend Lee Timmins’ 27th birthday in 2011.

Disappointed
 by the plain white cake that arrived which she had ordered, she decided
 to give put her ceramic skills to good use - and created her own 
two-part HGV lorry cake.

She has since competed in some of the UKs biggest cake-making competitions such as Manchester’s Cake International where she scooped the gold last year for her brown-and-yellow turtle cake with fondant fins - dedicated to her grandmother, Bella, who died last year aged of 91.

This year in March Vicki once again took
 gold for her design of popular advert character baby Oleg from Compare 
the Meerkat advert - a cake which took her 50 hours to make.

However luck has not always been on Vicki’s side as her first competition in Birmingham in 2013 almost ended in disaster when her cake design of a bulldog’s head fell off at the event.

Her fast-thinking dad caught the head before it smashed on the floor and even with only half a design she took the silver award and has learned a few tricks along the way.

Vicki said: 'When I loaded the bulldog cake into the car I noticed that it was slightly cracking so I tried to fill it in but it was getting bigger.

'When I got to the event and the head came right off and my dad managed to catch it in his hand before it landed on the floor. I was absolutely devastated and cried for ages, I was so exhausted and now I would have nothing to show for it.

'I realised where my downfall was as I didn’t use a support for the cake, usually I use dowels, from now on I generally use flat cakes if I can’t use anything to support it.'
