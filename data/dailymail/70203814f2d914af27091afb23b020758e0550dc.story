Scotland's flagship financial institutions could be forced by European law to become English if Scots vote to leave the UK, as big business lines up against independence.

Oil giant Shell last night became the biggest corporate big name so far to warn against Scotland going it alone, joining the likes of Lloyds, Barclays and Standard Life in raising the alarm about the break up of the UK.

It comes as an EU directive warns Scottish registered RBS and Lloyds would have to be redesignated as English because they would have their headquarters in London and do most of their business south of the Border. 

EU rules mean Scottish registered RBS and Lloyds would have to be redesignated as English

Banks and major financial institutions cannot be registered in a different country from their official headquarters. 

While RBS and Lloyds are both registered in Edinburgh at present, that will have to change if Scotland becomes independent, potentially costing thousands of jobs. 

The implications of the EU directive emerged as Lloyds, Britain's largest retail bank, warned yesterday that independence would send costs soaring for customers. 

Its annual report states: 'The impact of a Yes vote in favour of Scottish independence is uncertain.

The outcome could have a material impact on compliance costs, the tax position, and cost of funding for the group.'

It is the latest blow to Alex Salmond's separation plans and comes as flagship firms are lining up to quit the country in the event of a Yes vote.

Last night, former Chancellor Alistair Darling, head of the Better Together campaign, said: 'Today we have seen even more uncertainty emerge regarding what would happen if we vote to leave the UK. 

'Firstly Lloyds, a major employer here in Scotland, talked about the impact that going it alone would have on its business. 

'Now we see there is a threat that EU Law would require some of our biggest institutions to leave the country in order to be where their main customer base is. 

'With every passing day, more risks are coming to the surface. These are all risks that we do not need to face. If we want to avoid them, if we want to protect Scottish jobs, then we have to vote to stay in the UK.' 

First Minister Alex Salmond's plans for independence has suffered a blow as businesses including Shell raise concerns about its impact

Shell oil last night became the latest major UK business to oppose Scottish independence.

Ben van Beurden, chief executive of the Anglo-Dutch oil firm, warned of the economic risks of Scotland voting in favour of independence.

Mr van Beurden said: ‘We’d like to see Scotland remain part of the United Kingdom.

‘Shell has a long history of involvement in the North Sea – and therefore in Scotland – and we have continued to invest heavily there.’

Royal Dutch Shell, which has its headquarters in Britain, is the UK’s most valuable company.

In a speech to a reception in London last night, Mr Van Burden said that one of the many things his company values about the UK ‘is the continuity and stability it offers’.

Given a choice, we want to know as accurately as possible what investment conditions will look like 10 or 20 years from now,’ he added.

Mr Van Burden likened Scotland’s place in the UK to the UK’s place in the European Union – which he also supports – saying it all boils down to economic competitiveness.

The FTSE 100 firm joined the likes of Lloyds TSB and Barclays, which have also spoken out against Scotland becoming independent.

Lloyds and Barclays both yesterday cited concerns about Scottish independence in their annual reports.

Lloyds - which has its registered headquarters in Edinburgh - said it had concerns over a potential compliance costs and funding in the event of a ‘yes’ vote at the referendum.

It said: ‘The impact of a yes vote in favour of Scottish independence is uncertain.’

But it added that: ‘the outcome could have a ‘material impact on compliance costs, the tax position and funding for the group’.

The Deputy Prime Minister will also hit out at the ‘myths’ being peddled by ‘isolationists’ about the EU.

 Although BCCI was based in London, it was registered in Luxembourg - where the regulator was too small to monitor the bank properly before it collapsed. The EU directive was a safeguard introduced after the BBCI banking collapse in 1995.

The warning from Lloyds follows last week's announcement by pensions giant Standard Life that it has plans to relocate to England if the country backs separation, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk. 

Scotland's largest company RBS also raised fears over a referendum Yes vote as big business firmly came out in support of the Union. 

Yesterday other major Scottish based financial giants, including Scottish Equitable, Tesco Bank, Sainsbury's Bank and Scottish Widows - supporting around 20,000 jobs between them - confirmed they were closely following the independence debate and pointedly kept their options open. 

Lloyds employs more than 18,000 people in Scotland and is headquartered at the historic home of Bank of Scotland on the Mound in Edinburgh. Any decision to leave would be hugely symbolic as well as raising the fear of job losses. 

If RBS - Scotland's largest company - headed south, it could result in the loss of 3,200 Scots jobs.
Standard Life has said it is worried about a number of 'material issues', such as the currency that will be used in Scotland, membership of the European Union and personal taxes. It has now started work to establish additional registered companies to operate outside Scotland, into which it could transfer parts of its business. 

Standard Life's chief executive David Nish said: 'We will continue to seek clarity on these matters but uncertainty is likely to remain. In view of this, there are steps we will take based on our analysis of the risks.' 

Last night, Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Gavin Brown 'A clear pattern is now emerging, with increasing numbers of financial service companies having serious concerns about the uncertainty caused by the referendum. 

'While the European directive is unclear, were it to be the case that head offices did need to move south of the Border, this would present a risk to a considerable number of jobs in Scotland.' 

A UK Treasury spokesman said: 'Lloyds have now joined RBS and Standard Life in reasonably and fairly pointing out the risks and costs that arise from independence. 

'This uncertainty is being made worse by the Scottish Government's failure to set out a plan for what currency it would use in the event of independence. 

'These interventions from business show the strength and stability of the UK is the essential underpinning of Scotland's successful financial services sector over several centuries. It's common sense to stick with something that works.' 

Finance Secretary John Swinney said: 'Scotland has a strong and diverse economy and the point of independence is to win the powers we need to build on those strengths. 

'Lloyd's Banking Group's comments show exactly why our proposals for a formal currency area are the right proposals, why they are in the best interests of business on both sides of the Border and why that is what will be implemented by both governments.'

Last week Edinburgh-based insurance giant Standard Life said it might move some of its operations outside of Scotland in the event of independence.
