With their colourful bills and theatrical eye markings, they are sometimes called the clowns of the sea. But ever since I saw a breeding colony of puffins on an island in the Scillies, I’ve had an enormous respect for the bird.

For much of the year they fish far out in the Atlantic. They’re amazing swimmers and can dive 50 metres or more in pursuit of fish. Then, around this time of the year, they get together on a rocky island or cliff-top to begin their incredible courtship displays.

A glimpse of a breeding pair ‘kissing’ — rubbing their bright orange beaks together in a characteristic bonding activity — is unforgettable.

In danger: Puffins are one of a number of British species which are suffering because of the cold weather

So is the sight of a parent bird returning to its underground nest with half a dozen fish neatly arranged head-to-tail in its bill.

Tragically, this ageless drama is likely to be severely curtailed this year.

As the country shivers in unseasonably low temperatures, hundreds of frozen and emaciated puffins are being washed up along the east coast.

Experts say they are dying because of wind-chill and the difficulty of feeding in turbulent seas when fish are going deeper. One ecologist spoke of it as the worst ‘puffin wreck’ in half a century. And it’s not just sea birds that are suffering. Across Britain, the Arctic winds have plunged nature back into lockdown mode just as she was preparing for her big spring show.

It’s as if someone pressed the pause button just at the start of an action adventure movie.

Where I live on Exmoor we’ve thankfully been spared the snowfall that’s brought misery to so many parts of Britain. Even so, the icy blast from the east has halted spring in its tracks.

On many hedge-banks primroses have been out for a fortnight. But in the biting winds they’ve become limp and lifeless, tattered imitations of what they were meant to be. On the trees and hedgerows bud-burst has ground to a halt. Even the blackthorn — whose brilliant floral display is the most dependable of all the signs of spring — seems unwilling to put on a show this year.

Cold comfort: Farmers have been battling to save lambs as they are born into perishing conditions

Never has the old adage been truer — ‘ne’er cast a clout [warm piece of clothing] ’til May is out’.

Below the flower-less branches, a cock pheasant hunkers down to shelter from the wind. In a normal year, he’d be strutting and scrapping in a ritual contest for a mate. Today, all he thinks of is survival. In the field behind our house, the ewes and lambs have gone out to sparse pasture. Three weeks ago the turf appeared to be greening up. Now the plants on which the wealth of the countryside depends are back under starter’s orders. This means both ewes and lambs will be on frugal rations for a while. The only thing that’ll bring better times is a warm soil.

Conditions are far worse in snow-hit areas, of course. For many days, exhausted sheep farmers and shepherds have been probing deep drifts for signs of life. Despite the popular jokes, sheep are intelligent, resourceful animals. I’ve seen our hardy Exmoor sheep survive happily by foraging under a foot of snow.

But when they’re trapped beneath drifts several metres deep, there’s little chance for them. That’s why for many farming families the spring of 2013 will be memorable for all the wrong reasons.

For a reminder of a kinder spring I re-read a chapter of Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald’s war-time classic, A Country Chronicle.

He writes of March: ‘At the very end of the month the butterflies reappeared. I expect to see peacock and brimstone and tortoiseshell, as a rule, about the third week of the month.

‘I count among my great joys in the year this first sight of brimstone hovering in the sunlit lane and feeding on the fresh spring flowers. Among my great thrills is the sight of those golden wings fluttering over the primroses.’

March is also the time for hibernating mammals to wake, says Vesey-Fitzgerald.

‘Among mammals, dormice and bats are our only true hibernators. In March they begin to stir. It is the ear rather than the eye that catches the first signs of returning liveliness — little irritable squeakings, as though they resented the return of spring and would like another month in bed.’

For hibernating mammals, the spring of 2013 will provide a very rude awakening. Mammals such as dormice and hedgehogs spend the weeks before hibernation building up fat reserves to see them through their long sleep. When the winter is unusually long — as it has been this year — waking can bring the risk of starvation.

Insect-eating birds and bats are also likely to suffer. In the big March chill, insects are scarce. So the many small birds and bats that rely on them for food are likely to be on starvation rations. So is the wakening frog as it slides from its wintering place among a heap of damp, dead leaves. There’s no food, and when it reaches the pond there’s a solid layer of ice on top.

Butterflies are nowhere to be seen. The numbers of many species were hit hard by the deluges of last summer. The current icy weather will come as a further blow.

Battling the elements: Sheep farmers have been scouring snow drifts for signs of life

Yet for all the harshness of this frozen spring, there are compensations, too. A couple of days ago I took the high road home across the top of the Brendon Hills. In the dusk light, the roadside hedges and trees were painted in the gleaming, almost incandescent white of a thick hoar frost.

I stopped the car in a lay-by and switched off the engine and lights. It was a breath-taking sight. The cold Arctic air was clear as crystal. Looking across the Bristol Channel I could see the lights of distant Cardiff Airport as clearly as if it had been at the bottom of the hill.

And there, in the cold clarity of the frozen night, came the hope that only we humans know. However long this extended winter lasts, there will be a spring. The half-opened buds will finally burst and blossom will at last drape the trees. The hedgerows will explode into life, and bees and butterflies will once more fill the air.

In fact, there’s every likelihood that spring — whenever it comes — will be more showy and flamboyant than ever. Nature has an amazing way of balancing things out. It’s hard to believe that just one year ago we were all concerned about the drought!

There’s another message from this frozen spring, one that’s rather more sombre. For all our planet-changing skills and technology, we’re still at the mercy of the cosmos. A blast of icy air from the polar regions can even now — if not bring life in Britain to a halt — make things extremely uncomfortable.

However sophisticated our society may be, we continue to depend for our well-being on the elemental forces of nature. We ignore them at our peril.
