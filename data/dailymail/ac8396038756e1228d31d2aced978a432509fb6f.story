Annabel Karmel, 57, has suffered 'sleepless nights' during the year-long ordeal, her partner of eight years has revealed

The partner of celebrity chef Annabel Karmel has revealed her 'nightmare' after an employee she sacked accused her of sexual misconduct.

The 57-year-old, who writes books on children’s food, was alleged to have made sexual comments to Mark Salter, 39, in a bid to seduce him.

But he withdrew his claims as part of an undisclosed settlement between the two parties before an employment tribunal was due to start in London.

Stephen Margolis, her partner for eight years said, says the ordeal has devastated the family and, because of the agreement, she cannot tell her side of the story.

'It has been awful what Annabel has gone through. It has gone on for a year.

'She has suffered sleepless nights,' he told the Sunday Telegraph.

'It has been devastating. It has had a huge effect on the whole household.'

The film financier and lawyer said there was 'no evidence' to substantiate the claim, but it leaked to the press before the accusations were retracted.

Mrs Karmel had tried 
to keep the hearing secret, obtaining a gagging order preventing 
publication of her name, her company’s name and the name of her former 
employee.

It has been 
reported that Mr Salter claimed the celebrity author ‘only employed 
good-looking men’ and made inappropriate comments about his good looks 
in front of clients.

However,
 an investigation by the paper has revealed that he sued a previous 
employer after claiming that he had hurt his back lifting equipment.

Her legal team 
argued that her reputation and status as a ‘well-known media 
personality’ would be irreparably damaged regardless of the outcome of 
the case because it involved an  allegation of sexual misconduct.

Mrs Karmel was taken to a tribunal by an employee she sacked, but he retracted the claims after the two parties came to an agreement

After reaching the settlement, Mrs Karmel said: 'He withdrew his claim of sexual 
misconduct as part of an undisclosed settlement. In a statement issued 
through her lawyers.

'I have defended
his claim throughout and am glad this has now been resolved. It has 
been agreed that neither party will make any further comment on this 
matter.’

The
food guru has published 37 books, is regularly on television, radio and
in the Press and her business has expanded to include baby products and
ready meals.

Mrs Karmel says she was inspired to create healthy meals 
following the death of her first child, Natasha, and because of her son 
Nicholas’s fussy eating habits. She has two other grown-up children.

Divorced
from their father, oil broker Simon Karmel, she lives in a £20million 
home in one of London’s most sought-after districts with film producer 
partner Stephen Margolis.

Her books carry the seal of approval of Great Ormond Street Hospital and she was awarded an MBE in 2006.

Mark Salter, 39, claimed the chef made sexual comments to him while he was the sales director of her company. He retracted the claims on the eve of the tribunal
