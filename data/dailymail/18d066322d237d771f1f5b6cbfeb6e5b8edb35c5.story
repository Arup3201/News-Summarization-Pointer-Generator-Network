Care home boss Victoria Phillips (pictured) was jailed for a year after admitting stealing £5,000 - including money meant for elderly residents

A care home manager who stole money meant to pay for vulnerable residents' haircuts and gifts donated to staff, was behind bars today.

Victoria Phillips was jailed for a year after she helped herself to nearly £5,000 while running Alfreton Residential Home in Prenton, Merseyside.

Liverpool Crown Court heard that she breached the trust placed in her to target vulnerable residents who could 'ill-afford to lose what they did.' 

Phillips, who forged documentation to try and cover her tracks,  stole donations to the home, money for residents' haircuts and 'thank you' gifts to staff. 

She admitted 12 counts of theft totaling £4,821 between October, 2009, and October last year.

Judge Mark Brown said: 'It's clear that these offences involved the breach of a high degree of trust, given in particular the important position of responsibility that you had within the home.

'In one instance, you stole a relatively significant amount of money from the bank account of an elderly resident.

'On one occasion, you pocketed money that had been donated to the home by well-meaning individuals who no doubt wished to improve the conditions in which residents were living.

'On other occasions, you pocketed relative small amounts of cash intended as thank you presents to members of staff for the good work that they had performed. 

'There were occasions when you pocketed small amounts of money that were set aside for sundries, such as residents having their hair attended to.'

The judge said Phillips, who pleaded guilty to theft, committed 'mean and nasty offences' over a significant period of time.

He added: 'In effect, you were stealing from elderly residents, elderly victims, who could possibly ill-afford to lose what they did and people whom the public would expect would be cared for properly. You as a manager had the duty to ensure that was the position'.

Phillips admitted 12 counts of theft while working at at Alfreton Residential Home, in Prenton, Merseyside

Eleven of the charges involved sums of money that ranged from £50 to £2,000 and belonged to various named people.

During September, 2012, she also took £900 belonging to the care home.

Phillips resigned in October last year.

John Ballam, defending, said mum-of-one Phillips acted out of 'need rather than greed' after enduring financial struggles.

He said she was in thrall to a violent ex-husband and was 'fearful' of telling him of their money issues.

He said: 'She has ex- pressed considerable re-morse and shame. She was a caring person, she would like to think she still is, but she committed very nasty offences against these people and she thoroughly regrets that.'
