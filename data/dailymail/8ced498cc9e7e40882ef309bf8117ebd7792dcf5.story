Hull, having lost 1-0 to Belgian outfit Lokeren in their Europa League qualifier on Thursday night, will be eager to get back to winning ways in the Premier League against Stoke City.

Steve Bruce's side got their campaign off to a flying start last week - beating QPR 1-0 at Loftus Road. Stoke, on the other hand, were the opposite, losing to Aston Villa at home by the same scoreline.

Team news 

Hull 

Hull manager Steve Bruce is expected to make wholesale changes when his side host Stoke on Sunday.

The Tigers side beaten by Lokeren in Thursday's Europa League play-off first leg included just two of the starting XI which beat QPR on the opening day of the Barclays Premier League season and Bruce will shuffle his pack again.

Robbed of debut: Robert Snodgrass's competitive debut for Hull will have to wait as the midfielder is a long-term absentee with a knee injury picked up in pre-season

Yannick Sagbo serves the second and final game of a domestic ban, while Robert Snodgrass (knee) is a long-term absentee.

Provisional squad: McGregor, Harper, Chester, Davies, Bruce, Figueroa, Rosenior, McShane, Boyd, Elmohamady, Huddlestone, Livermore, Ince, Brady, Jelavic, Aluko, Quinn, Robertson.

Stoke

Stoke will be without Stephen Ireland for Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Hull at the KC Stadium after the midfielder sustained a chest injury in training.

Potters boss Mark Hughes revealed that Ireland has pulled a muscle in his rib cage and looks set to be out for 'a couple of weeks at least, but he is confident defender Robert Huth will overcome a slight knee problem to be available.

The manager is weighing up whether it will be too soon, given his lack of game time in pre-season, to hand forward Victor Moses his Potters debut following his loan move from Chelsea, while defender Geoff Cameron and striker Peter Odemwingie, who both played at the World Cup, are poised to come into the squad after sitting out last week's campaign-opening loss to Aston Villa.

Provisional squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Butland, Pieters, Huth, Muniesa, Wilson, Shawcross, Cameron, Wilkinson, Shotton, Teixeira, Bardsley, Whelan, Nzonzi, Adam, Sidwell, Odemwingie, Arnautovic, Walters, Crouch, Krkic, Diouf.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

180 minutes of football between Hull and Stoke in the Barclays Premier League last season produced a total of just one goal (from Peter Odemwingie).

Stoke have lost just one of their last 10 games against The Tigers (W4 D5).

Hull have not won consecutive Premier League games since September last year.

Only relegated Cardiff and Norwich (two each) won fewer away games than Stoke (3) in the Premier League last season.

Stoke, along with Tottenham, were one of only two teams not to pick up a booking on the opening weekend.

Nikica Jelavic has scored only five goals in his last 48 Premier League appearances.

Peter Crouch is playing a fourth successive season with the same club for the first time in his career (played in three seasons for Villa, Liverpool & Spurs).

Crouch is the only player in Stoke’s Premier League history to reach double figures for away goals (he has 10).

James Chester has only ever had three shots on target in the Premier League but has scored two goals.

Hull conceded only 21 Premier League goals at home in 2013-14, the same number as Manchester United.
