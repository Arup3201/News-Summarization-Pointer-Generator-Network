Agents from the FBI questioned the only known suspect in the Sept. 11, 2012 U.S. consulate attack in Benghazi that killed four diplomats, the suspect's Tunisian lawyer has told The Associated Press.

Ali Harzi, a Tunisian, was detained in Turkey and extradited to Tunisia in October where authorities have said he is 'strongly suspected' of being involved in the bloody commando-style attack on the Libyan mission.

Additionally, his lawyer, Anwar Oued-Ali, added FBI agents also asked Harzi about the U.S. embassy attack in Tunisia a few days after the assault in Libya, suggesting American authorities are probing a connection between the two incidents.

Burning issue: Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack on the consulate in Benghazi

The Sept. 11 assault by armed men in 
the Libyan city of Benghazi killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stephens and 
three other American diplomats. Members of an Islamist militia, Ansar 
al-Sharia, are suspected in the strike, but there has been little 
progress in the Libya-based investigation into the attack.

A few days later, a mob attacked the 
U.S. embassy in Tunis, destroying property and an American school in the
area, resulting in four deaths. The attack was believed to be 
instigated by a local group also called Ansar al-Sharia, but it is 
unclear if it is connected to the Libyan organization.

In early November, Republican senators
Lindsey Graham and Saxby Chambliss announced that Tunisia had agreed to
allow the FBI to interview Harzi, but it took another month and a half 
to organize the interview due to legal questions over any infringements 
on Tunisian sovereignty.

In the end, three FBI investigators 
using a Moroccan translator posed questions to Harzi for three hours 
through the Tunisian judge presiding over the case.

Harzi's defense team was not allowed 
to attend the questioning on the grounds that he was being interviewed 
as a "witness" rather than a defendant.

Harzi is being charged by the Tunisians for "membership in a terrorist organization." Harzi denies the charges.

Attack: A U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed in the terror strike that occurred on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11

Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior

Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours

According to the timeline, around 9.40 p.m. Benghazi time on Sept 11, officials at the CIA's relatively fortified and well-defended base in Benghazi got a call from State Department officials at the U.S. diplomatic mission about a mile away that the less-fortified public mission complex had come under attack from a group of militants.

Other official sources said that the initial wave of attacks on the diplomatic mission involved setting fires using diesel fuel.

9.40pm - CIA officials in 'The Annex' get a distress call from the consulate saying they are under attack.

10.05pm - Armed only with handguns, team of about six CIA security officers leave their base for the public diplomatic mission compound.

10.30pm - With bullets whistling overhead, the CIA team move into the compound after unsuccessfully trying to get heavy weapons and help from local Libyan allies.

11.10pm - A Defense Department drone, which had 
been on an unrelated mission some distance away, arrived in Benghazi to 
help officials on the ground gather information.

11.30pm - U.S. personnel who had been working or staying at the mission all accounted for, except for Ambassador Stevens.

11.40pm - Driving back to the secure base, the evacuees come under further fire.

12am - The installation itself comes under fire from small arms and rocket-propelled grenades.

12am - A CIA security team 
based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, lands at 
Benghazi airport and begins plotting how to locate the missing ambassador.

1am - The patchy attacks on the base begin to die down after 90 minutes of fierce fighting.

4am - The 
reinforcements from Tripoli take a convoy of 
vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for evacuation.

4.30am - a fresh round of mortar attacks is launched on the base, killing two U.S. security officers.

5.30 - A heavily armed Libyan military unit 
arrive at the CIA base to help evacuate the compound of U.S. personnel 
to the Benghazi airport.

From 6am - Roughly 30 Americans, as well as the bodies of 
Stevens and the other three Americans killed during the attacks, were 
loaded on planes and flown out of the city, several U.S. officials said.

The dense smoke created by the fuel both made it hard for people at the compound to breathe and to organize a response to the attack.

About 25 minutes after the initial report came into the CIA base, a team of about six agency security officers left their base for the public diplomatic mission compound.

Over the succeeding 25 minutes, the CIA team approached the compound, and tried, apparently unsuccessfully, to get local Libyan allies to bring them a supply of heavier weapons, and eventually moved into the burning diplomatic compound, the intelligence official said.

At around 11.10pm, a Defense Department drone, which had been on an unrelated mission some distance away, arrived in Benghazi to help officials on the ground gather information.

By 11.30, U.S. personnel who had been working or staying at the mission had been rounded up except for Ambassador Stevens, who was missing, the intelligence official said.

When they tried to drive out of the diplomatic compound to return to the CIA base, however, the convoy carrying U.S. evacuees came under fire.

Once they got back to the CIA base, that installation itself came under fire from what the intelligence official described as small arms and rocket-propelled grenades.

These patchy attacks went on for roughly 90 minutes, the intelligence official said.

Around the same time, a CIA security team 
based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, landed at 
Benghazi airport. Upon its arrival, however, the team spent some time 
trying both to arrange local transport and to locate the missing 
Ambassador Stevens.

After some time
trying to solve these problems, the security team that had flown in 
from Tripoli eventually arranged for an armed local escort and extra 
transportation, but decided not to go the hospital where they believed 
Stevens had been taken.

In part this was because they had reason to 
believe Stevens was likely dead, and because security at the hospital 
was believed, at best, to be 'uncertain,' the intelligence official 
said.

Not long before dawn, the 
reinforcements from Tripoli managed to take themselves and a convoy of 
vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for an anticipated evacuation.

However,
just after they arrived at the CIA base, the official said, a new round
of attacks on that facility was launched, this time with mortars. 
Although the mortar attacks lasted only 11 minutes, two US security 
officers were killed by a direct hit from one of the shells, the 
intelligence official said.

Finally,
a bit less than an hour later, a heavily armed Libyan military unit 
arrived at the CIA base to help evacuate the compound of U.S. personnel 
to the Benghazi airport, the official added.

Over
the next few hours, roughly 30 Americans, as well as the bodies of 
Stevens and the other three Americans killed during the attacks, were 
loaded on planes and flown out of the city, several U.S. officials said.
