On trial: Bouchra Bagour, 35, leaves court (file photo)

A French court has found a mother guilty of 'justifying a crime' after sending her three-year-old son, Jihad, to school in a T-shirt with the slogans: 'I am a bomb' and 'Born on Sept. 11'.

Bouchra Bagour, 35, was given a one month suspended sentence and fined 2000 Euros. Her brother Zayed, who had the T-shirt made, received a two month suspended prison sentence and a fine of 4000 Euros.

The case was brought after a teacher at the child's pre-school in Sorgues near Avignon complained about the T-shirt. She and the school's principal were shocked and alerted authorities.

Bagour insisted she  had put it on her son 'without stopping to think about it' when he wore it to school on 24 September last year.

A few days later the town mayor, Thierry Lagneau of the conservative UMP party, asked prosecutors to investigate.

I condemn the attitude of the parents who shamefully took advantage of the person and the age of this child to convey a political message,' Lagneau said at the time.

The verdict of an appeals court in Nimes overruled an earlier decision to acquit the pair.

Bagour's lawyer Gaele Guenon told AP she was astonished the acquital had been overturned.

During her trial Bagour denied the charge of defending terrorism through the T-shirt message.

'I thought it might make people laugh,' she said, according to Le Parisien.

The expression plays on the popular French saying 'Je suis la bombe', which translates roughly as 'I am the best'.

The back of the T-shirt read 'Born on 11 September,' but Bagour insisted it was only a reference to her son's date of birth.

Bagour's brother - who gave the 
child the T-shirt was also charged.

Zayed Bagour denied trying to promote a message by buying the T-shirt.

'It's the day his birth I wanted to highlight, not the year,' he told the court.

In
 an interview with the newspaper La Provence in November, Boucha Bagour 
said that while she is Muslim, 'there is no message to be conveyed by 
the T-shirt — no intent.'

Controversial: A T-shirt similar to the one worn by three-year-old Jihad

'Bomb' is used in the sense of 'handsome,' nothing more,' she said. 

However, lawyer Claude Avril said: 'Idiocy is often the best alibi to hide real intentions', reported Sky News.

'The most scandalous thing is that they've used and manipulated a three-year-old child to voluntarily convey the words of a terrorist.'

The prosecutor in Avignon previously told the court the family must have known the reaction the boy’s clothing would provoke, reported The Local.

'At some point there must be limits. They are not stupid. They understand the significance of what they are doing,' he said.

Josette Pessemesse, from the far-left 
Front de Gauche party, wrote an open letter to the court defending the 'right to humour.' It was signed by around 50 people.

'This is the same as qualifying all Muslims as terrorists,' Pessemesse told France Info.
