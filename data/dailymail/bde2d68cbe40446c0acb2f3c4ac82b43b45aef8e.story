Rival: Alexis Tsipras, leader of the Radical Left Coalition party, yesterday met with leader of the election-winning New Democracy party, Antonio Samaras

Greece’s radical left-wing Syriza party insisted the country’s commitment to austerity was no longer valid after voters turned their backs on bailout deals, as its leader tried to form a new coalition government on Tuesday.

Alexis Tsipras, head of the Radical Left Coalition that came a surprise second in Sunday’s election, appeared determined to act on the punishing message sent by voters fed-up with austerity by defying stern warnings from the European Union and Germany for the country to stick to its agreed bailout deal or risk default.

He called on Greece’s two main party leaders, the conservative New Democracy and Socialist Pasok to reverse their support for the multi-billion euro bailout that is keeping Greece from bankruptcy.

'There is no way we will attempt to sneak back what the Greek people threw out in the election,' he said, referring to a slew of recent austerity measures which include drastic pension and salary cuts and tax hikes.

'The public has voted in large masses against the barbaric policies of the EU memorandum,' said Tsipras, who is determined to seek a left-led coalition which will reject the bailout terms.

His goal will be to win over the Communist Party of Greece, KKE, but his efforts may prove fruitless, after the communists already rejected any possibility of cooperation with Syriza.

The Democractic Left, seen as a more moderate and pro-Europe party already gave Syriza its backing.

Voters ended up punishing mainstream parties, New Democracy and the Socialist Pasok, for their handling of the financial crisis which has forced the country in a fifth year of recession and encountered record unemployment.

Instead, the electorate directed their support to several smaller parties, ranging from moderate leftists to the extreme right fascist party Golden Dawn accused for attacks against immigrants.

A large proportion, disillusioned with the entire political system which they see as being corrupt refused to even vote, with abstention recorded at an all time high at 35 per cent.

Tsipras will be given three days to seek coalition partners to clinch a deal before the mandate is passed to former finance minister Evangelos Venizelos, whose Socialist Pasok party came in third.

If no agreement can be found new elections will be called, probably for June.

Divided citizens: New Democracy party leader Antonis Samaras won the election, but his party was unable to form a government

More than six in ten Greeks voted against austerity measures. Of these, some put their faith in neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn - led by Nikolaos Michaloliakos - which won seven per cent of the vote.

Fresh elections would only increase fears the country's deficit-cutting program could be derailed.

They could also hinder Europe's painful efforts to resolve the beleaguered country's debt crisis.

Shares were hammered by nearly seven per cent on the Athens Stock Exchange yesterday, and were down a further 1.3 per cent by midday trading today.

The government, however, managed to raise 1.3billion euros ($1.69bn) in a debt auction today, with Greece's short-term borrowing costs continuing to creep up.

It sold six-month treasury bills at an interest rate of 4.69 per cent, compared with a 4.55 per cent rate at an auction last month.
