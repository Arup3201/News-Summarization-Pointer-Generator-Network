A teenager who was searching for her missing pet was relieved when she was told someone had found the dog and taken it to the vet, only to find out the animal had been put down.

Kerri Lawson, 18, put an appeal on Facebook when her Labrador Homer sneaked out of the garden of her family home in Washington, Tyne and Wear, and disappeared.

Her despair initially turned to joy when she was told it had been found by a member of the public who took the animal, which had arthritis which makes him drag his back leg, to a vet.

But she was then told by the vet that they had put Homer down because of his condition - without telling his devastated owner first. 

Kerri Lawson said she was distraught after she found her missing dog had been handed in by a member of the public to the vet, only for staff to decide to put the animal down - without informing her first 

Ms Lawson said: 'Homer did have a few health problems, but he was not as bad as the vet said he was.

'They shouldn't have just gone ahead and done this without our say-so.'

After Homer, who was 16-years-old, disappeared he was found by a member of the public and taken to Cestria Vets in Chester-le-Street. 

Vets said he was having trouble breathing and within 24 hours he was put to sleep. 

Ms Lawson believes the arthritis in his legs, which caused him to drag his back leg and look ill, was known to the vets after Homer was injured in an accident 12 years ago.

The student added: 'The problems were known to the vet and they said it was completely fine and there was no need to worry.

'They should have contacted the dog warden at the council to tell them he had been handed in.

'They could have waited. That way, we would have known he had been found - we would have had a point of contact.

Miss Lawson said her pet had arthritis in his legs, but claimed veterinary staff had known about his condition

'We had no way of knowing he'd been taken to the vets.'

Homer was not microchipped but Ms Lawson said he had a docked tail and cauliflower ear, making him more distinctive. He was also not wearing a collar.  

Veterinary staff said they were forced to take action after the Labrador was found 'thin and experiencing breathing difficulties.' 

A spokeswoman for the practice said staff take their responsibilities to animals very seriously and said it would not have been ethical for them to have admitted such an unwell animal, thought to have been a stray, in such a 'desperate' condition.

She added: 'Our obligation to stray animals is to provide such emergency treatment and pain relief as is appropriate and we treat many strays each year, before either successfully reuniting them with their owners, or passing them on to the relevant authorities.

The dog was taken to Cestria Veterinary Centre in Chester-le-street, where the dog was then put down 

'Homer was brought in on Saturday morning by a member of the public. We checked our 'lost' register, in which we record details of missing animals reported to the surgery, but found no matching entry.

'We did not attempt to contact the dog warden, as we had previously been informed that they did not operate at weekends.

'The police no longer have legal responsibility for stray dogs and do not maintain a list.' 

The woman said the animal was examined by two veterinary surgeons who found he was agitated and distressed.

Microchipping dogs is to become compulsory by April 2016, along with ensuring all details stored on the microchip are updated.

Owners who don't comply can be fined £500.

Recent research by the Dogs Trust found that 57 per cent of owners do not realise microchipping will become a legal obligation in 12 months time. 

They also found 46 per cent of British dog owners do not update their animal's microchip with address details when they move. 

This is in spite of 22 per cent of owners admitting their dogs strayed within 48 hours of them moving to a new area. 

The Dogs Trust estimate there are 1,780,000 dogs in the UK who are not microchipped.

Around 72 per cent of dog owners are unaware that they only have seven days to recover a missing dog from a Local Authority before they are rehomed or put to sleep. 

'Obviously elderly, he was making clawing, repetitive movements of his front legs, but was unable to stand, even when supported and was barely responsive to his surroundings,' she added. 

'His lung and heart sounds were muffled and indistinct, he was very thin and was experiencing breathing difficulties. 

'They decided that his condition was terminal and considered his prognosis hopeless.

'No palliative treatment could have been provided which would have rendered his condition comfortable, and accordingly he was painlessly put down.

'It is not acceptable, either legally or ethically, for us to admit a stray animal in such a desperate clinical condition to the hospital, in the hope that an owner comes forward. 

'It is always with deep regret that we take this drastic action, which is only done to prevent further suffering, but these few unfortunate animals are put down with a gentle touch and a kind word.

'His owners have our deepest sympathy.'
