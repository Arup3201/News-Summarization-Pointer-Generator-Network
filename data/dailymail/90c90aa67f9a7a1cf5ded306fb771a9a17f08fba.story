Meet Craig 'frog' Falconer - the man who recently sold his soul.

The New Zealand hotel manager auctioned it for NZD$51, which equates to about AUD$46, on an auction website.

What prompted Mr Falconer to do the irreversible was a dispute with council over the renewal of his hotel's liquor licence.

He was so frustrated that he decided to do 'something mad', Sunshine Coast Daily reports.

New Zealand hotel manager Craig 'frog' Falconer sold his soul for AUD$46 on an auction website Trade Me

'I bought an old vodka bottle in the shape of skull for NZD$10,' Mr Falconer said.

'I filled it up with dirty water - that's my soul - and put it on Trade Me.'

Mr Falconer, the manager of Commercial Hotel, says that he was trying to raise funds for a potential legal battle against the council.

The skull - Mr Falconer's 'soul' - gained about 20 bids and the page had more than 3000 views.

In the end, the winning bid went to his friend in Auckland.

And Mr Falconer seemed unfazed that he was now a soulless man.

'Well, I never had much of one to begin with ... all I was selling was what's left of it.'
