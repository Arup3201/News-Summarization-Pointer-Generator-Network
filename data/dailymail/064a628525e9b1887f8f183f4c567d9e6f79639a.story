A wealthy City worker has taken his own life in a mysterious double suicide with a childhood friend.

Guido Schiatti, who lived in Fulham and worked for General Electric, gassed himself in the mansion owned by his parents in one of Milan’s smartest piazzas. 

Found in the same room - in a twin bed - was the lifeless body of his childhood friend Fabio Bernini. Both were 33.

The two men, discovered with plastic bags over their heads, had apparently poisoned themselves with gas.

Mystery: Guido Schiatti was found dead alongside his childhood friend Fabio Bernini in Milan

Contrasting lives: Fabio Bernini had recently lost his job and was living with his parents

An empty bottle of pills were also found in the room.

Mr Bernini, who was unemployed, left two suicide notes in which he despaired at what he saw as his failings in life.

But family and friends are unable to make sense of his childhood companion's inexplicable decision. 

The young City worker, who had a position as a engineering manger at U.S. multinational General Electric, was ‘in the happiest time of his life,’ his parents told the Italian newspaper the Corriere della Sera. 

‘When he was younger he was a little reckless but he had settled.'

Both leave behind young children, although they were separated from their children’s mothers.

Mr Schiatti returned from London every fortnight to see his five-year-old daughter, who lived with her mother in another apartment in his family's palazzo in central Milan.

His relationship with the mother had ended but was said to be friendly and he saw his daughter regularly. 

‘Forgive me for what I have done. I am desperate and without work' - Fabio Bernini

Meanwhile Mr Bernini, whom he had known his entire life, had been working as a salesman but had lost his job and was living with his parents outside Milan.

He also had a child, a two-year-old son called Jacopo, who he left a suicide letter for. 

The poignant note asked for forgiveness and said he was sorry that he hadn’t been able to give him a proper family. 

‘You won’t remember me anyway,’ he wrote.

Another letter, for his mother, said he was 'desperate'. He wrote: ‘Forgive me for what I have done. ‘I am desperate and without work.’ 

The last person to see the two old friends alive had been Mr Schiatti’s brother-in law who had gone with the pair to see a football match between Inter Milan and Parma on Sunday afternoon.

Mr Schiatti was supposed to return to London on Monday morning.

But his mother raised the alarm when she hadn’t been able to reach him since Sunday night.

Finding the apartment locked from the inside she called the fire brigade who broke in and discovered the bodies.
