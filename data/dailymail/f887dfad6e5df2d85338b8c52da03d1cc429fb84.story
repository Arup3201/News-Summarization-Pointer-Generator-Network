One own goal in a match is unfortunate, to net two is unusual - but to have a total of five in a single fixture leads to disqualification.

In the Indonesian First Division play-offs, PSS Sleman beat PSIS Semarang 3-2... and all five of the strikes were own goals!

Incredibly, the score was 0-0 with just four minutes remaining and yet five own goals were scored before the final whistle.

The Indonesian FA disqualified both PSS Sleman and PSIS Semarang are five own goals were scored in a game

Sleman put the ball into their own net twice - but anything they could do, Semarang could do better as they went one better and scored three own goals.Â 

The Football Association of Indonesia disqualified both sides from the entire tournament, meaning they cannot be promoted from the First Division - which is Indonesia's third tier.

An Indonesian FA committee ruled both sides had deliberately tried to lose the match in order to avoid a potential semi-final match-up with Borneo FC.

Borneo FC allegedly have connections to the local mafia, so it is rumoured neither side wished to face them as a result.
