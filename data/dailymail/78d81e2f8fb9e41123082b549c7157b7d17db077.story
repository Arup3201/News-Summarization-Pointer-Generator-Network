A cat from Devon has a claim to be the oldest moggy in the world after celebrating her 25th birthday.

Tortoiseshell 'Putts' was born in January 1989 - several months before the fall of the Berlin Wall.

She has lived through five British prime ministers and is now a staggering 120 in human years.

She is now thought to be the oldest living cat in the world, beating Guinness World Record holder, US-born Corduroy, by six months.

Putts, a tortoiseshell from Sidmouth, Devon, is celebrating her 25th year, making her the oldest cat in the world

She was born in the 1989, the same year as the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Tienanmen Square protests

Owner David Willey says living with a younger cat, and taking plenty of catnaps, have kept her youthful

The pet cat from Sidmouth is celebrating her record breaking age by tucking into her favourite meal of chicken and having a nap.

Her owner David Willey, 64, said: 'She is an absolutely fantastic cat, and still very happy. We thought we were going to lose her a week or so ago, but she perked up and she's fine now.'

'She loves lying and napping in a quiet little place, and she liked her food too - but we have to break it up for her now.'

He added: 'She gets groomed every day and she loves the garden we have. I think she has been kept lively by my wife's cat Millie, who is 14.

'She still likes to play with her now and again, but she doesn't let her get the better of her - my cat has long claws which she uses to keep Millie at bay.'

Putts - formerly called Springer - was born in a litter of three to her mother Daisy in January 1989.

Her owners say they keep fearing ill health will kill Putts, but she always manages to recover and pull through

Mr Willey says she still has her wits about her and can keep his wife's much-younger cat at bay

Mr Willey and his wife have no proof of Putts's birth, so can't have her amazing age officially recognised

She lived with Mr Willey before he married wife Joyce, 66, seven years ago, and they all now live together with her cat, Millie, and their border collie, Ben.

Gardener and decorator Mr Willey said Putts helped him through ill-health before he met Joyce.

'When we lived in a flat together just the two of us she stuck by me,' he said; 'She was with me all the time.'

Sadly the couple have no proof of Putts' age so can't officially have her recognised as the oldest living cat in the world.

'Putts is definitely 25 and a half, but I've got no proof of it,' said Mr Willey; 'It's a mystery to us how she's survived so long.'

Retired carer Mrs Willey added: 'She's probably living on borrowed time. Sadly we can't keep her going forever.'
