Conman: James Whitehouse, pictured, swindled £1,800 from his victims by taking out payday loans in their names

A conman who romanced women he met online then took out payday loans in their names has been jailed.

Gambling addict James Whitehouse, 30, drove one of his victims to bankruptcy after making off with hundreds of pounds and leaving her to deal with high-interest repayments.

He was imprisoned for two years at Birmingham Crown Court after admitting four counts of fraud, totalling £1,800, against victims he met on dating website Plenty of Fish.

The court heard that one of the victims thought Whitehouse was 'the perfect man' until he stole her identity for easy cash.

After using their personal details to apply for loans, he told the four women to expect money to arrive in their bank accounts to be forwarded to him.

Not realising the funds came from high-interest loans companies, his victims sent Whitehouse the payments and were later hit with the bill for the loans he had taken out in their name.

Meanwhile he used the money to fund his gambling habit.

Zaheer Afzal, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Whitehouse befriended women over an internet 
site, gained their trust and confidence, then exploited them.

'He used the same method in every case and left the victims vulnerable to high interest payments to payday lenders.

'His victims were financially and emotionally exploited.'

Whitehouse first targeted women in February 2011 and struck up another relationship in September last year.

The
court heard he went on to fleece two more women after he was arrested 
the following month, when one of his victims went to the police.

'Perfect man': Whitehouse found his victims on dating website Plenty of Fish. None of the people pictured were involved in the court case.

Sentencing, Judge William Davis QC told 
Whitehouse: 'You moved from one to the next, leaving them financially 
worse off and emotionally beleaguered.

'You deceived and defrauded vulnerable women one after the other, purely to support your gambling habit.'

Since being arrested for his crimes, the court heard that Whitehouse has tried to control his addiction, and has saved up £500 with which to repay his victims.

Niall Skinner, defending, said: 'He wanted to repay the victims some of the money.

'He seems to have made good progress with his gambling addiction himself but he isn’t naive enough to say he’s conquered it.'
