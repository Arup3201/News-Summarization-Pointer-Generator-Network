Martin Skrtel scored twice as Liverpool took Arsenal apart in this this fixture last season. For Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers, however, the goal he scored late at Anfield on Sunday may prove more important.

Skrtel in some ways epitomises Liverpool’s defending in that he doesn’t always look quite good enough. There is no doubting the Slovakian’s bravery, however. He may have been withdrawn had Liverpool had better back-up on their bench after a horrible clash with Olivier Giroud that left him with a stud-shaped hole in the back of his head.

All wrapped up like a rather sombre Christmas present, though, Skrtel rampaged on and the crashing header he delivered from a corner at the death has at least given his manager reason to believe that maybe not everything in the football universe is against him right now.

As nine minutes of injury time – added on solely because of Skrtel’s injury – rolled by, Liverpool did appear to be heading to a successive Barclays Premier League defeat in eight days. Once again, it would have been unjust.

The figures of Liverpool’s last two games, against Manchester United and Arsenal, are stacked remarkably in their favour. More shots, more passes, but somehow there have been fewer goals. This time, at least, Rodgers’ team managed to emerge with a little of what they deserved.

Liverpool are getting better, of that there is no doubt.

The first half they contributed against Basle in the Champions League just two weeks away was dismal. They played without tempo, conviction or rhythm. At that point – so bad were they as they exited the competition – that it was tempting to worry a little for Rodgers’ future.

Since then, though, Liverpool’s manager has summoned up a little anger, a little bit of dog, and his team have responded, at least in the manner of their performances.

Much is still awry. Liverpool defended horribly at times once again on Sunday and Brad Jones hinted once again at what we already know. He is not the answer to Liverpool’s goalkeeping problems.

Meanwhile, they lack ruthlessness in front of goal which is hardly surprising given that they lack a reliable centre forward.

Their football, however, is beginning to resemble that of last season in some areas. On Sunday, as they did at Old Trafford a week ago, they worried Arsenal for long periods with some neat midfield combinations and some much improved running off the ball. If their attacking play had a focal point, someone like Daniel Sturridge for example, then they may begin to move forwards.

Their best players in the first half were the creative Brazilian Coutinho and 20-year-old Lazar Markovic. The young Serbian was the fall guy against Basle as he was sent off but has shown enough in recent days to suggest he may transpire to be a rare success for Liverpool’s much-talked about transfer committee.

Brendan Rodgers's side had looked as though they were heading for their second consecutive defeat

For the first 40 minutes, Liverpool were the only team in the game but struggled to open Arsenal up. Perhaps Arsene Wenger knew what he was doing. Liverpool are at their best rampaging forward on the counter attack but find things much harder when confronted with teams sitting deep.

This is how it was on Sunday as Liverpool poked and prodded without ever really looking desperately dangerous.

It was the closing minutes of the half, though, that summed up Rodgers’ problems at the moment. Finally they scored only to concede horribly – scruffily – at the other end. One step forwards two steps back.

After that it was not surprising to see the home team fall behind. This is how it has been this season. One setback often follows another at Anfield.

Wenger suggested his team had played with ‘the handbrake on’ for too long and even floated the idea that his team were still troubled mentally by last February’s 5-1 hiding. If that is the case then Wenger needs to borrow Liverpool’s psychologist Dr Steve Peters for a while.

Still Arsenal managed to lead, though. Their second goal was easy on their eye from their point of view but Liverpool’s video analysis today will show three red shirts marking dead space as Giroud was left unattended.

All of that is familiar to Rodgers, of course. Liverpool continue to defend without authority and as long as that continues they will struggle to close the rather large gap between themselves and the top four.

Their manager, though, will at least see other, better, things in his team that he recognises now. On Friday in his pre-match press conference he lost his composure with the media for the first time in two and a half seasons.

If it was a show of defiance then it was mirrored, at least in part, by his team on Sunday. Rodgers said afterwards that his team had been ‘outstanding’. They weren't, but they were much better
