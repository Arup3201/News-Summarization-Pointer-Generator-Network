When most women conjure up images of their perfect man, it's likely to involve elements of Hollywood heartthrobs George Clooney and Ryan Gosling with a dash of Bradley Cooper and a sprinkling of Robert Pattinson.

But what happens when you mix the best bits of the world's best looking men?

One company set about doing just that - and the results are intriguing.

Are these the world's dreamiest men? Researchers asked women their favourite features from celebrities under 30, left, and over 30, right. The younger model combines  Harry Styles' with Zac Efron and Robert Pattison. The older face, right, combines George Clooney's hair with David Beckham's beard

Women were asked to identify the best features from their favourite male celebrities and two 'perfect faces' were created based on the results to show just what women look for in male beauty.

They reveal what the most 'handsome' man in the world would look like by combining the best-loved features from our favourite stars.

One Direction's Harry Styles' curly and unkempt hair was voted the most popular. This was combined with Zac Efron's piercing blue eyes and Twilight hunk Robert Pattison's manly stubble.

The older face combines George Clooney's greying 'silver fox' hair with David Beckham's beard.

The look is finished off with Bradley Cooper's blue eyes, model David Gandy's jawline and Brad Pitt's nose.

The survey revealed that women believe older stars look better with a full beard rather than stubble, which works better on under-30s.

George Clooney's enduring popularity shows that greying hair is no barrier to sex appeal.

Surgeon Asim Shahmalak from the Crown Clinic, who created the images based on research, said that David Beckham and George Clooney were the two male celebrities whose hair men seeking a hair transplant want to replicate.

He said: 'Have you ever seen David Beckham or George Clooney have a bad hair day?

'Whatever hair style they adopt, they look amazing. It is the same with their facial hair: clean-shaven, heavy stubble, full beard - they looking fantastic with all of them.'
