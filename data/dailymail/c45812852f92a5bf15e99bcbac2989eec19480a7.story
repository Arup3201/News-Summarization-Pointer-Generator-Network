Bulgarian immigrant Atanas Miryanov, 38, was tonight beginning a 17-year prison sentence after being convicted of raping a woman in a Sutton bedsit

A Bulgarian immigrant who lured a woman to his flat with the promise of a job before raping her was tonight beginning a 17-year prison sentence.

Atanas Miryanov 38. invited the 26-year-old woman to his bedsit in Sutton, Surrey, on the pretext of interviewing her after she
 responded to his  online advert seeking women to work at a car-wash.

Miryanov, a convicted rapist who had only been the UK for 11 months, raped her, threatened her with a knife and then tried to push her out of a second-floor window, Croydon Crown Court heard.

Today he was jailed for 17 years for the attack after a judge branded him a 'dangerous and predatory criminal.'

The
 jury heard that the woman, who is also Bulgarian, communicated with a 
man she believed was called Georgi, after responding to the online 
advert placed on Novoto, a Bulgarian, Gumtree-style listings website.

On
 July 1 last year she went to the bedsit in Sutton Common Road, Sutton, 
Surrey and was told that the manager of the car-wash would be arriving 
later.

The
 woman was made to wait for several hours while Miryanov, who pretended his name was 'Georgi', drank alcohol, tried to ply her with alcohol, and became increasingly drunk.

When the woman decided to leave, Miryanov threw her on the bed and raped her.  During the ordeal he held a knife to the woman's throat after she feigned an asthma attack.

She managed to get to a second floor window in a bid to escape but Miryanov then tried to push her out of it.

The victim's screams were heard by several passers-by and other occupants of the property, leading to police being called.

Miryanov was arrested, but claimed that the victim had consented to having sex with him.

Today he was found guilty of rape and the court was told that he had committed a similar offence in Germany 10 years before.

Sentencing, the Recorder of Croydon, 
Warwick McKinnon told the the car-wash worker, who sat in the dock in a 
grey tracksuit: 'This has had an appalling and devastating effect on the
 victim and it will take many, many years for her to recover.

How he lured his victim: Miryanov advertised for car-wash workers on Bulgarian language website, Novoto

'You have a previous conviction in not very different circumstances where a knife is involved for which you were sentenced to eight years.

'I have no doubt in assessing you as dangerous by virtue of the seriousness of the offence and your previous conviction.'

'You have shown no remorse for this dreadful offence. You tricked a woman into your home, you tried to ply her with alcohol without success.

'When she decided the job was not for her and she tried to leave, you stopped her from doing so and carried out an attack of sustained violence.'

Prosecutor Kate Blumgart told the court how he manipulated his victim following the attack, telling her that no-one would believe her if she told them what had happened.

The court heard how Miryanov had also used a knife in his 2002 attack in Germany, and claimed sex was consensual.

Sentencing Miryanov at Croydon Crown Court, the Recorder of Croydon, Warwick McKinnon, told him he was 'dangerous'

Detective Sergeant Janet Archibald, of the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, said afterwards: 'Miryanov subjected the victim in this case to a terrifying sexual assault. 

'The victim said she was prepared to risk her own life in order to escape from him and she did this by climbing semi-naked and precariously onto a high window ledge, and fortunately her cries were heard by members of the public.'

A spokesman for the UK Border Agency said efforts would now be made to deport Miryanov.

They said the recent lifting of immigration restrictions on Bulgarians to the UK would not affect UK policy to deport EU nationals who are sentenced to 12 months or more for crimes involving drugs or sexual or violent crimes.

Implying that nothing of Miryanov's previous conviction was known when he entered the UK, the UKBA spokesman said: 'Where we receive 
information that foreign nationals present a genuine threat to society, 
we are able to take action to prevent their entry to the UK.

'The onus for flagging any threat lies with the authorities in the individualâ€™s home country.

'The Government is doing everything it can to prevent immigration abuse and,
 as the Home Secretary has said, it is right that EU members look to 
reform the way free movement rules work in future.'

The spokesman said a new information sharing system, to be introduced in October this year, would improve European-wide police information sharing.

The second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) will allow British police to access EU law enforcement alerts, which will help prevent criminals entering the UK.
