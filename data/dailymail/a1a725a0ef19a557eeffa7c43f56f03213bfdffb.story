With just minutes to go before the eleventh hour of the eleventh day, the most celebrated public artwork of modern times was finally completed yesterday – by a 13-year-old Berkshire cadet.

The Tower of London poppies have been a triumph of unusual teamwork. And the consortium of free-thinking creatives and old soldiers who have made it happen were all standing proudly in their blood-red moat to see it finished.

The very first of these ceramic poppies – one for every British and colonial serviceman killed in the Great War – had been planted in July by the Tower’s longest-serving Yeoman Warder. 

Yesterday morning, the honour of adding the last went to the younger generation. 

Honour: Cadet Harry Hayes, 13, gives a fine salute after adding the very last ceramic poppy to the Tower of London moat yesterday in front of a line-up of Forces VIPs

Harry Hayes, a new recruit to the Combined Cadet Force at Reading’s Blue Coat School, stepped smartly forward and pressed poppy number 888,246 into the damp soil. 

His own great, great, great uncle, Private Patrick Kelly of the Irish Guards, was killed in 1918.

After a salute worthy of a Sandhurst drill sergeant (‘I have been practising,’ he admitted), Harry rejoined the line-up of VIPs for the two-minute silence. It was observed by millions all over Britain, including the Queen and the Prime Minister.

Even in this 16-acre panorama of sacrifice, we could still put a name to this final poppy.

Harry Hayes's great-great-great uncle Private Patrick Kelly (pictured left and right with two friends, Jim Foy and unknown) was killed in action on September 27 1918, weeks before the war ended 

For, we know that shortly before the 11am Armistice in 1918, Private George Ellison, from Leeds, was the last British soldier to be killed in the Great War. A 40-year-old father of two, he had fought through the entire conflict with the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, only to be shot on the last morning near Mons, the scene of his first battle in 1914.

George Ellison’s poppy, like everyone else’s, will be uprooted today and sent to those who bought them before they sold out weeks ago. Once all outstanding bills are paid, £10million will be shared between six Forces charities. 

Some of the beneficiaries were at the Tower yesterday. Capt Tony Harris, 33, late of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, lost a leg in Afghanistan, won a gold medal at the Invictus Games and is now an ambassador for Help for Heroes.

‘Our regimental headquarters are at the Tower, my children were baptised here and I feel a bond with every one of those men represented here,’ he said.

Bryn Parry, ex-soldier and co-founder of Help for Heroes, had brought along the cigarette case which great uncle George had been carrying when he was shot in Flanders.

‘This has been a beautiful, tranquil reminder of the horrific, bloody chaos of war,’ said Mr Parry. Yesterday’s proceedings began with a Roll Call by the Constable of the Tower, General Lord Dannatt.

In full, plumed ceremonial rig, he recited 200 names, ten at a time in between each round of a 21-gun salute. Last on the list was Lt Maurice Dease, the first VC of the First World War. 

Looking on was a distinguished veteran of the Second, his scarlet Chelsea Pensioner’s uniform offering perfect camouflage in the moat. Lieutenant-Colonel John Humphreys was captured in North Africa, escaped in Italy, rejoined his unit, was captured again in 1944 as he fought on the bridge at Arnhem and escaped once more.

‘Every one of those poppies is a mother’s son,’ he said softly.

A huge crowd gathered to watch as the final poppy was planted in the moat at the Tower of London during this morning's ceremony

Smoke from a gun salute was seen behind crowds at the service this morning at the completed Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red

Four Beefeaters led out the small VIP party representing every strand of this installation, officially known as Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red. They included the two visionaries behind it.

There was Paul Cummins, the ceramic artist who came up with the idea of the poppies, borrowed £1million to get them started and lost a finger producing them.

He was accompanied by Tom Piper, the theatre designer who brought them to life and devised dramatic flourishes such as ‘The Wave’, a surge of poppies over the drawbridge, and ‘The Weeping Window’, the torrent of red gushing from the ramparts.

A yeoman warder looked across the poppies before the ceremony took place, attended by tens of thousands from around the world 

All 888,246 poppies have now been planted in the dry 16-acre moat, heralding the completion of the poignant memorial

 Both are thrilled that these separate structures have now been bought by the Government and will tour the country before enjoying a permanent home at the Imperial War Museums.

‘The best thing has been all the camaraderie,’ said Mr Cummins. For Mr Piper, the most moving moment was being asked to read the names at a twilight Roll Call and learning of a great uncle killed in 1918. He has already moved on to new projects, but he will never forget what he admits is ‘probably the triumph of my life’ at the Tower.

On the walkways overlooking the ‘Seas of Red’, there was still no end to the sea of humanity wanting a look last night, by which the official number of spectators had exceeded five million. Wherever these poppies end up, every single one will not only be a reminder of a life lost – but also of the stunning way in which, a century later, they were all commemorated.
