The last time David Moyes took career advice from Sir Alex Ferguson, things did not work out quite so well.

But that did not stop him seeking the opinion of his predecessor at Old Trafford before accepting the invitation to become the new manager of Real Sociedad, as he revealed after his official unveiling in San Sebastian.

It would suggest Moyes harbours no grudge against Ferguson after his dismissal from United in April, or indeed after an updated version of Ferguson’s autobiography was released last month. If some saw the new chapter as less than complimentary about Moyes, the former Everton manager did not take offence once he was aware of the full context.

Moyes admits he took advice from Sir Alex Ferguson, as he did before taking over at Manchester United

There was not a hint of bitterness as he embarked on this new Spanish adventure here on Thursday. Not only did he feel rejuvenated after a seven-month break but he felt vindicated too, such are the difficulties Louis van Gaal has endured this season after amassing fewer points than Moyes at the same stage last year. He was even generous towards his Dutch successor, who he said should be given more time than he was.

The conversation with Ferguson was nevertheless an interesting one. ‘I phoned Sir Alex about coming out and he spoke about the job and the opportunity, which he thought was a great one for me,’ he said. ‘He thought it would be a good chance and something very few British managers get the opportunity to do.’

Very few British managers get the very top jobs in English football these days and the 10-month spell he endured at United will always be a source of frustration. But appearing before the Spanish media here at the Anoeta Stadium there was no shortage of confidence. 

He was relaxed and self-assured, delighted to be in Spain’s wealthiest city even if his new boss happens to be in the arms business.

‘I feel that I have now got myself in a position where I’m in a good frame of mind,’ he said, smiling. ‘I feel good. I still stand by what I said at the time that I was not given enough time at United to succeed or fail.

‘I think there was nothing wrong with how we worked and everyone can see that whoever is in charge at Manchester United, it is quite a long job to do things. Nine months would never be enough time for any manager.

‘I do think that most real football people understood that there would be a period of transition at Manchester United when you take over from Sir Alex. I always believed I was the right person for the job and I still believe that is the case. But Louis van Gaal now has to be given the time to do the job.’

If that amounted to a bit of score-settling, his focus soon shifted to the opportunity he now has at ‘La Real’.

He sat in the bar of his hotel on Thursday night and spoke enthusiastically of the plans he has seen for the stadium refurbishment; the fact that the pitch will be lowered to accommodate new seating that will fill the space currently occupied by a running track.

And he revealed how he would be beginning Spanish lessons on Monday, determined to embrace the culture here as much as the challenge of managing in a league he considers superior to English football’s top flight. As he said, Spain has the ‘best players’ and the clubs currently dominating European football. ‘Look at the last Champions League final,’ he said.

In the main press conference he was asked by a Spanish journalist if he was ‘more of a Mourinho or a Guardiola’. He did not duck the question, the one-time Chosen One answering that he was more like the Special One because he ‘works hard’ and has a history at Everton of building successful teams.

They seem to like talk of Everton here. They regard themselves on a similar level and the league finishes Moyes consistently achieved at Goodison Park would be seen as success by the Basques.

Their excitement here is almost tangible. They view Moyes as quite a catch, ‘a big international coach’, so much so that golfer Jose Maria Olazabal — a Basque himself — made the effort to join him for dinner with senior club officials.

Moyes seemed to like that, just as he was delighted to hear from his old friend Carlo Ancelotti on Thursday morning. ‘He welcomed me to Spain,’ he said of the Real Madrid manager.

‘I’m looking forward to getting back out on the grass and working and coaching again,’ he said.

‘This for me is a big challenge to come away and take on a big Spanish club who are at the wrong end of the table and need to be pulled up.

‘It’s probably my biggest challenge because it is a different country and you come here not actually knowing the players as directly as you might back home.’
