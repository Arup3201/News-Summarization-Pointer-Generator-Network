Nine months after Brittney Brashers met fellow Airman Robbie Walters while on duty in Iraq, she was dead - apparently killed as their car crashed after a late-night drinking session.

But detectives arriving on the scene thought something didn't look quite right - and questioned whether Brittney was in fact already dead before the moment of impact.

Now, 48 Hours has detailed the couple's violent relationship, the troublesome investigation into her death and the eventual murder conviction against Walters - which was granted after he admitted strangling her while his wife secretly recorded him.

Her family has also revealed the heartbreaking moment they found out about her death - and how the life sentence for Walters will never be enough for taking Brittney from them.

Murder: Young Iraq veteran, Brittney Brashers (left) was strangled to death by her on-off boyfriend Robbie Walters (right) who then covered up the killing by staging a car crash after a night of drinking

Brittney was found injured in her car's driver's seat on November 17, 2009, with her on-off boyfriend beside her. She was pronounced dead at the Denver Health Medical Center in Denver, Colorado.

'I know I couldn't cry,' her younger brother John told the CBS show. 'Like that night, I couldn't. I was just in so much shock. Like, there's no way it's actually happened.'

The death came after Brittney had enjoyed a successful career with the Air Force. She had signed up aged 20, three years after her mother died of cancer and she fell in with a bad crowd.

'She really needed the discipline,' her father Barry said. 'The part of being a part of something.'

Happier times: The couple met when they were both stationed in Iraq as working for the Air Force

Fun-loving: Walters, who maintains his innocence, said he remembers Brittney as 'a free spirit'

And she immediately excelled as a technician at the Air Force dental lab in Colorado Springs, her boss, Master Sgt. Art Figeroa, said.

'She
was one of our top performers and that's how I looked at her,' he said.
'She loved what she did. I mean, she helped people out. She was easy to
like and everybody liked her.'

In
February 2009, Brittney was deployed to Iraq and assigned to non-combat
security, and met an Airman from southern California named Robbie 
Walters.

'She had so much 
energy. She was such a free spirit and amazing girl,' Walters remembered
in the program. 'She was all smiles every time I talked to her.'

As
their relationship blossomed, Brittney was stunned when she learned 
Walters was married - but he assured her it was solely for the 
separation pay and he was devoted to his new girlfriend.

Outstanding: Colleagues said Brittney, 22, excelled in the forces and loved that she was helping other people

Kicked out: Walters was discharged because of discipline problems and they reunited in the U.S.

But he was kicked out of the forces 
due to his disciplinary problems and, when Brittney returned to the 
Colorado lab after four months of service, Walters was there to meet 
her.

'It was all good for probably a month,' her best friend Tiffany Peeples said. 'And
then Brittney went from being this vibrant girl and this superstar 
Airman to showing up to work late. Just kinda pushing everybody out of 
her life.'

Peeples said it 
was at that time that she started to dislike her friend's new boyfriend.
The couple would break up and then get back together - and Walters 
became increasingly violent, she said.

'He
would do crazy things like park her car in the middle of a four lane in
traffic with her in the passenger seat, take the keys out and run with 
her sitting there in the car,' Peeples recounted.

Then,
during an argument outside Brittney's home in October 2009, he hit her 
and left her with bruises. She called the police and Robbie spent a few 
days behind bars.

Three weeks later, after she had started playing with a girls' football team, Walters said he wanted to see her again, and she relented.

Secrets: Brittney found out that Walters was married - but he said it was a marriage of convenience

Evil: But when they returned to the U.S., he became violent and hit her, and they repeatedly broke up

He joined her at a photo shoot for her football team, where the girls stripped naked but used each other's body parts to maintain their modesty for the camera.

Investigators believe seeing Brittney 
remove her top with other people in the room pushed Walters over the 
edge - and led to him killing her just hours later.

Drunk, they left the photo shoot after midnight - but an hour later, the car slammed into a parked vehicle on a dead-end street, alerting neighbours to call authorities. Brittney was killed in the crash.

Detective Troy Bisgard told 48 Hours that Walters' story that they had been falling asleep initially made sense, but something didn't look right - so they called in a homicide team.

'They're the ones telling me, "Look, it was a car accident but it wasn't so significant that she should be dead from it",' Bisgard said.

A medical examiner found Brittney had alcohol in her body, but only just over the legal limit. There were no drugs in her system.

Crash: A scene picture shows the wreckage after the crash on a dead-end road in November 2009

Scene: Brittney's head hit the windshield - but investigators said she would not have died from the impact. Walters' wife later revealed she had recorded him admitting to strangling Brittney in the car

They also found that she didn't hit 
windshield that hard and had been left with no significant injuries of 
her organs, neck, spinal cord or brain.

Yet,
strangely, she did have bruising around her temple and upper right 
cheek. In further signs that she could have been strangled, there were 
hemorrhages on her skin and around her eyes.

But
medical examiners came against an odd problem when trying to find if 
she had been strangled; because of her anatomy, she was missing a piece 
of cartilage in her throat that is usually crushed if someone is 
strangled. So the manner of death was ruled as 'undetermined'.

Detectives were dedicated to finding out the truth about her death.

Despite his earlier protestations that his marriage to his wife, Elena, was nothing, Walters returned to her in California. When detective Bisgard heard he had had a big fight with her, he gave her a call.

Interrogation: Walters told detectives he did not kill her but evidence, such as bruising on Brittney's face and blood inside the vehicle that splattered before the crash, were against him

With barely a prompt, Elena told him Walters had confessed to punching and strangling Brittney and covering it up with the accident. As he confessed, Elena had pressed 'record' on her mobile phone.

'I look over at her and just took a shot in the dark where her head would be and bam!' he says on the recording. 'I punched the girl with all my might. She felt like a f***ing house dropped on her.'

He added that he held down his forearm against her neck to kill her.

Walters was arrested but said he had not been telling the truth in the recording. He insisted his wife had started the conversation and he 'just agreed with her to get the conversation to end'.

In August 2011, the case went to court, where prosecutors said Brittney had been driving, they swapped seats and he began punching her, before moving her back into the driver's seat for the accident.

They presented other evidence, including how 911 callers had seen the car erratically braking on the highway, suggesting times he had been hitting her.

Killer: Speaking from prison, Walters told 48 Hours that he believes his wife was bitter for his affair and was out to get him

Missed: Brittney's father Barry said the conviction was no reason to celebrate - as he is still without his daughter

There was also blood in the car that had not splattered as she hit the windshield.

He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life without parole - and her family said they felt 'instant relief'.

But Mr Brashers added: 'You know, you don't wanna say, 'Yeah!' and cheer because it doesn't really change anything. I mean, my daughter's not gonna come back.'

Walters said he will appeal the conviction as his wife recorded him without her knowledge, which is illegal in their home state of California. He added that she schemed against him out of revenge.

'She thought we were gonna be together,' he told 48 Hours. 'I fell in love with someone else. And broke her heart, tore her to pieces. Sorry for breaking her heart, but I'm not a murderer.'
