A serial shoplifter who was compared to Little Britain's Andy after she leapt out of a wheelchair to steal food has been jailed. 

In scenes reminiscent of the BBC comedy show Leoni Clare was captured on camera being pushed around a service station by her very own Lou on the A45 near Coventry, West Midlands.

When other shoppers backs were turned, the 28-year-old jumped out of the seat and started stuffing £60 of meat into her rucksack.

 The unemployed 28-year-old admitted three counts of theft when she appeared before magistrates without the assistance of her wheelchair.

I want that one: Clare was caught on CCTV being pushed into the service station in a wheelchair only to get up when other shoppers backs were turned

The 28-year-old then jumped out of the seat and started stuffing £60 worth of meat into her coat and rucksack

Andy and Lou became popular after Little Britain was first screened in 2003. Matt Lucas played Andy, who feigned disability and let his hapless carer, Lou, played by David Walliams, run around after him.

The sketches were made famous by Andy's catchphrases; 'yeah, I know', 'I want that one' and 'don't like it'.

Ninda Gill, prosecuting, told Coventry Magistrates Court that Clare had been referred to as the 'Little Britain thief' following the crime on January 11. 

'The defendant, who was in a wheelchair and being pushed by a man, entered the BP garage,' she said.

'The defendant stood up from her wheelchair and picked up a selection of cold meats.

'She left the store without paying.

'The incident was captured on CCTV and has since been used by police in their appeals.

'The media have described it as 'Little Britain thief' so it has got a lot of attention.

Clare, who has a string of previous convictions, also stole perfume worth £28 for a chemist and a further £25 worth of meat from Marks and Spencer on separate occasions.

Stefan Hunka, defending, said that Clare has to 'learn to stand on her own to feet.' 

'She is a single lady, residing with her mother who is also not in the best of health,' said Ms Hunka.

'Her grandmother is extremely poorly Running alongside that, she is not working.

Her antics led to her being dubbed the Little Britain thief and compared to the characters Lou and Andy. She was jailed for 14 weeks by magistrates

'She was in hospital for six weeks in relation to a blood clot in her leg and was discharged earlier in January.

'She committed the third offence whilst on bail, which is why she is in custody today.

'She has to learn to stand on her own two feet and realise that there are many people outside this room who have the same problems but do not commit crime.'#

Sentencing, chairman of the bench Graham Holloway said: 'We have listened carefully to what our prosecution and your solicitor have had to say.

'However the bench feels we have been backed into a corner and we have no option to activate the previous suspended sentence imposed some time ago.'

Clare, who was wearing a grey hooded jumper, sobbed as she was jailed for 14 weeks.  

As she was led away a member of the public hurled abuse at the bench of two men and one woman.

Clare, from Coventry, was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £20.

The characters Lou and Andy were created by David Walliams and Matt Lucas for the hit BBC comedy
