A 'dead zombie Jimmy Savile' costume has been withdrawn from sale after it was branded tasteless by charities helping victims of abuse.

Online retailers Amazon sent an email advertising the Halloween costume for £14.99, prompting angry reactions from customers.

It comes as details of 2009 interviews with the disgraced celebrity over child abuse allegations were released by Surrey Police, in which he boasted that he had to 'brush girls off like midges' at the BBC.

An accompanying description of the outfit said the outfit is 'perfect for bad taste parties, Halloween and zombie Jimmy Savile fancy dress'

An accompanying description of the outfit said the outfit is 'perfect for bad taste parties, Halloween and zombie Jimmy Savile fancy dress'.

It is modeled by a man wearing a white wig, a powdered white face, with 'blood' dripping from his mouth.

He smiles into the camera and hold his hands out menacingly, while dressed in Savile's trademark shell suit, coloured glasses, medallion and cigar.

Peter Saunders, at National Association for People Abused in Childhood, told the Sunday Express: 'It is tasteless, senseless, and extremely insensitive.

'Nobody wants to remember Savile’s horrible face, particularly his many victims.'

Amazon said the costume is no longer on sale.

Details of a 56-minute interview, carried out two years before Savile died, came to light last week.

The
 83-year-old said accusations from three of his teenage victims were the
 ‘complete fantasy’ of people ‘looking for a few quid’.

He boasted he ‘owned’ the NHS hospital at Stoke Mandeville and said he brushed off girls ‘like midges’.

The transcripts have led to accusations that the officers treated Savile with kid gloves.

In
 March the policing watchdog HMIC identified 11 failures in the case, 
including the ‘lack of challenge to Savile’s assertions’.

The transcripts were released by Surrey Police following a freedom of information request.

A major review of the decision not to charge Savile in 2009 concluded 
in January there was nothing to suggest the victims had colluded in 
their stories, or that they were unreliable.
