Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is currently on the hunt for a new home Down Under.

The 64-year-old has officially become an Australian resident after getting a ‘permanent residency’ stamped on his passport.

The tech guru, who applied for an Australian citizenship in 2012, had planned to settle in Tasmania but after spending some time around Manly in Sydney’s northern beaches – he may even consider a home by the sea.

Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is currently on the hunt for a new home Down Under

The Wozniaks previous Californian modern-style home features six bedrooms, fireplace, hot tub/spa, swimming pool and seven bathrooms is currently listed on the market for an asking price of $4,100,000

The stunning home was originally built and designed by Wozniak in 1986 before he sold it in 2009 for $3.1million

‘I have now got a visa for distinguished people – or something like that – it took a long time and cost some money, but we have done it for our entire family, so we can all reside here,’ Wozniak told the Australian Financial Review.

‘I want to be a distinguished part of this country and some day I may say I lived and died an Australian, and that would be a really nice thing to be able to say. No country is perfect, but I like a lot of things about this place.’

The decision to make the big move to Australia with his wife, Janet, came after he received an email from an old friend – Sydney barrister Nicholas Baltinos, according to the Australian Financial Review.

The waterfront property in Tasmania, offers four levels of stylish beachside living, three bedrooms, heated pool, jacuzzi, sauna and shower, underfloor heating, remote control blind and back to base alarm systems

The harbourfront property in Manly is seeking offers over $6.8 million. It features five bedrooms, private beach access with large boatshed, swimming pool, chef's kitchen, private balcony with spa and double garage

The waterfront property in Tasmania is asking for offers around $1,990,000. The three storey home features six bedrooms, five bathrooms, balcony, home theatre-media room, indoor and outdoor living areas

While he continues to be based in the US, he intends to buy his first home in Sydney but will likely choose Tasmania as a permanent location to retire in the future.

‘The Premier of Tasmania actually called us at our home and offered to show us around if we were ever there. Hopefully in the next few days we can get there, as I really like the idea of cooler weather,’ Wozniak said.

The possibility of the Wozniaks calling Sydney home is quite high as he was appointed as an adjunct professor at the University of Technology in October while his son, who is married to an Australian, has been residing in the area.

Wozniak said that moving from California will be tough but he will continue to keep on top with the latest developments and contribute his ideas to the company on what works best.

The true gadget enthusiast, who is still officially an employee of Apple, is famous for his work with Apple founder Steve Jobs after they met in 1971.

The stunning beachside property in Manly is asking for offers over $5.5 million. Built less than three years ago, the contemporary-themed home features six king-size bedrooms, heated pool and jacuzzi and double garage

Built in 2014, the stunning modern home in Tasmania is asking from $1.2 million. It features four bedrooms, four bathrooms, powder room, stunning chef's kitchen, entertainment areas, media room and four car garage

The spectacular property in Sydney is on the market for $2.3 million. It offers four bedrooms, spacious modern kitchen, swimming pool, fireplace, internal life, large outdoor entertaining, and walking distances to CBD

With property prices booming across the country, it appears Wozniak has a taste in a modern-style home after building his own spectacular six bedroom property in Los Gatos in California in 1986 and sold in 2004 for $3.1 million.

Combining post-modern style with majestic natural views, the stunning property features a fireplace, hot tub/spa, swimming pool and seven bathrooms and retains several of Wozniak's most unique designs.
