A runaway dog who disappeared for nearly two months and lost a leg after he was hit by a car has been reunited with his owner.

After a seven-week search, Beagle-mix TJ was found by Animal Control officers in Boulder, Colorado, when locals reported a dog that had been hit by a car.

As officers prepared to take the four-year-old dog to the vet, they scanned him and discovered he had a microchip which linked him to Dave Snyder of Fort Collins, a 55-mile drive away.

Beagle-mix TJ was found by Animal Control officers in Boulder, Colorado, when locals reported a stray dog that had been hit by a car, seven weeks after he went missing in Fort Collins, some 50 miles away

TJ is now recovering at home after his right hind leg was amputated. He is expected to need further surgery to stabilise his front right leg, the Coloradoan reported.

'He's now a tripod. But he's in good spirits.' Mr Synder told Sarah Jane Kyle, who covers volunteerism, nonprofits and philanthropy for the paper.

TJ and Mr Snyder had been together less than a year when the dog ran away from a dog sitter in City Park on May 14. Distraught, Mr Snyder had posted flyers and notified authorities and the local Humane Society.

He even hired a private search team to look for TJ.

TJ spent the first two years of his life in a cage as a research beagle in Wyoming before he was rehabilitated and put up for adoption, and is still mistrustful of people, said his owner Dave Snyder, 27

For weeks after, he was getting calls from people saying they'd seen his dog, and even spotted the errant pet himself in LaPorte, but TJ proved elusive and efforts to catch him failed.

Mr Snyder told Boulder Police the sightings stopped on June 8 and after that he believed the dog had been hit by a car or killed by another animal.

Boulder Animal Control began getting calls about a dog-at-large about three weeks ago, said Boulder Police. Officers tried to catch the dog several times, even setting a trap, but without success.

They finally caught up with TJ last Wednesday after residents reported he'd been hit by a car. He was badly hurt and needed urgent veterinary treatment.

TJ spent the first two years of his life in a cage as a research beagle in Wyoming, Mr Snyder said, before he was rehabilitated and put up for adoption.

'He wasn't a normal little guy when we got him,' Mr Snyder told the Coloradoan. "He didn't bark for over a year. He didn't know what to do with a yard."

Mr Snyder now faces an eye-watering $12,000 bill for TJ's treatment, after deciding putting the dog down 'just wasn't an option'.

He has set up an online fundraising page for anyone who wants to help.
