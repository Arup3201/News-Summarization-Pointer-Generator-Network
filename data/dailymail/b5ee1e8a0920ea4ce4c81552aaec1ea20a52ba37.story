One of the prostitutes who is defending the alleged father and son pimps in court, was given a black eye by one of them - but says she deserved it, according to a man who offered to help her.

As the court heard about the spacious suburban homes with swimming pools in the back garden and BMWs in the drive that the prostitutes were given, they were also told the men would verbally abuse the women and, in one case, gave Desiree Ellis a black eye in 2007.

In recorded phone calls played in court, George Jr was heard to say to the women: 'You 
like being a cheap ho?' and 'I’m waxing your a** in the morning'.

Former prosecutor David Novick told the court that when he asked Ms Ellis about her black eye at the time, 'She said she deserved it, and it wasn’t
a big deal'.

Vincent George, 55, and his son Vincent George Jr, 35, have been charged with money laundering and sex trafficking for allegedly forcing five young women into prostitution, and then beating them and withholding money from them.

The five blondes from Pennsylvania would drive into New York City and work eight-hour shifts, turning tricks for $300 each in the backseat of clients' cars or posh Manhattan hotel rooms, according to testimony.

'She, I thought, was moving towards wanting help, but ended up not going that way,' Mr Novick, who  offered Miss Ellis help on July 27, 2007, said.

'I recall specifically her telling me that she got the black eye from her then pimp.'

The 24-year-old however, denied she was a victim, and said she works 'with' not 'for' George Jr, according to the Daily News.

'I had a bad date. The gentleman was unhappy with the service he had gotten and we got physical.' she testified, adding that she 'never stated' George Jr. hit her.

Miss Ellis and two other women - Danielle Geissler and Heather Keith, who is eight months pregnant with another man's child - testified previously 
of how happy they were with their lifestyles and the perks of the job, 
which included spacious homes in Allentown, Pennsylvania, vacations and fridges full of food.

Secretly recorded conversations 
between the Georges, who have admitted 47 years of pimping between 
them, reveal how keeping their employees happy, or getting the 'b*****s to sit' as they described it, was just good business.

'I had a lot of b*****s, dad,' George Jr, is heard saying to his father, as he recalls past employees who left for other pimps or lifestyles.

'Dad, you been in this s*** twice the 
time I’ve been in this s***, so I know your numbers [of former 
employees] is stupid, you know what I mean?' he adds.

George Jr adds. 'If them b*****s 
would have sat ...' before his father interrupts and says: 'We’d be 
f*****g rich, man.'

Despite their lucrative earnings in 
the sex trade, the women wanted regular lifestyles, with nice homes that
had swimming pools.

'They certainly had jewelry, too, and 
nice clothes,' George Jr’s lawyer, David Epstein, told The New York Post. 'But 
they weren’t "bling-bling" kind of women.'

'They would go to work at fancy 
Manhattan hotels, but then come home and walk around in their slippers, 
do their laundry, housecleaning,' he said.

Despite the veneer of normality the prostitutes presented to the outside world, neighbors said they were suspicious of the women and the Georges, who lived about two miles from them.

'We knew something wasn’t normal because they didn’t keep their yard like everyone else,' a 73-year-old, who gave her name only as Judy, told The New York Post.
