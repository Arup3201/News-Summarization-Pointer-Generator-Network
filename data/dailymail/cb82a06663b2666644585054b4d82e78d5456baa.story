A mother of five has been fined and branded a nuisance by council officials after her terrible singing enraged neighbours.

Carrie Taylor bought a karaoke machine to keep her children entertained, but also used the gadget with visiting family friends.

Their non-stop singalongs to hits such as Angels by Robbie Williams, Abba's Dancing Queen and tunes from High School Musical sparked complaints from other local residents in Colne, Lancashire.

An investigation by Pendle Council led to a noise abatement order telling Ms Taylor, 32, to turn down the volume, but after she allegedly ignored the edict five times officials took her to court.

Fined: Mother-of-five Carrie Taylor has been prosecuted for singing out-of-tune karaoke too loudly

Gadget: Ms Taylor bought this karaoke machine to keep her children entertained and also used it herself

Now she been been fined £600 at Reedley Magistrates' Court, and will also have to pay £130 of court costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

Ms Taylor, a carer and part-time chef whose five children are aged between five and 14, said today: 'I feel like I can't even breathe in my own house without someone complaining that it is being too noisy.

'People should understand that I have five children, and I feel I really can't do anything without getting complained about. If we do play music it is never that loud, we can all hear each other talking.

'I bought the kids a karaoke machine for Christmas and a disco ball and we play the CDs through the 50in TV and sing along. It's fun. I don't think we have the music on full blast.

'On the karaoke machine we like to listen to High School Musical and Robbie Williams and all the pop music which is out. I get up and sing with them, I don't have the best voice but the kids are good. My daughter does cheerleading too, and so she practises here with her friends.

'It is my house and I should be able to relax in it - and we like listening to music.'

She added: 'I think it's a load of rubbish that people are saying we are making their lives a misery. I'm really cross about the whole thing. I'm normally in bed by about 9pm or 10pm.

'All I want to do at weekends is sleep, I have five kids so I don't even have time for a social life myself - let alone parties.

'I'm working hard and paying my rent and I can't do what I want in my own house. I can't believe it has come to this. My kids can't even play out now without my neighbour coming around complaining.'

Ms Taylor was first served with an abatement notice by Pendle Council on November 14 but was recorded breaching it just a fortnight later on November 28. Further breaches were noted on December 18, January 15, February 3 and February 16.

The court heard Taylor was witnessed by the Lancashire Night Time Noise Service failing to comply with the terms of her notice and the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

Magistrates heard she repeatedly played music with a 'loud bass beat' that prevented her neighbours from sleeping. Complaints were also made regarding 'raised voices, swearing and general rowdy behaviour' from inside her terraced home.

After the case one neighbour said: 'It's been going on for a long time and it makes me feel as though someone else is controlling my life. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping as well.

'In the summer they will be outside and I have my windows open and I can hear the pop music. I can hear them singing and it is not very good.'

Councillor John David, Pendle Council's portfolio holder for environmental services, said: 'This particular resident has made her neighbours' lives an absolute misery.

'Nobody should have to put up with such antisocial behaviour.'
