A homeowner on a military base has provoked his neighbors' fury after displaying what they believed were effigies of African-Americans being lynched in his front yard for Halloween.

The display was outside a residence at Fort Campbell, between Tennessee and Kentucky.

The decorations, which were snapped and submitted to ClarksvilleNow.com, appear to show two larger figures along with one smaller person dangling in the air, and are fastened to a tree with rope.

Controversy: These Halloween decorations have been accused of showing an African American family being lynched 

The figures have black trash bags for heads.

At the bottom of the central figure, who has a sign of some sort, a smaller figure is seen holding onto its legs with a knife sticking out of its body.

Shocked residents took photos and posted them to Facebook, which attracted more attention to the display. 

'Lynching wasn't even on my mind when we put this up. It was the furthest thing from my mind,' Tou Vue, the homeowner who put up the display told KARE.

'I didn't mean to offend anyone and I apologize.'

The owner said he had just moved to the area and he and his wife wanted to make a Halloween family out of their leaves

He said he had just moved to the area and he and his wife  wanted to make a Halloween family out of their leaves.

He said the scene showed a dad and son by the tree and mom by the door, but he has now taken them down. 

'It's 2014 and it's truly despicable, especially in such a culturally diverse neighborhood,' neighbor Briana Rodgers Kingsley said, reports USA TODAY.

Fort Campbell spokeswoman Brendalyn Carpenter told RawStory there had been a complaint and they are no longer up.

'Lynching wasn't even on my mind when we put this up. It was the furthest thing from my mind,' Tou Vue, the homeowner who put up the display told KARE.

Tou Vue, the homeowner who put up the display, talks to an angry resident and says he meant no harm

Tou Vue hugs a resident after she explains she was offended by the display. City Councilor Blong Yang also turned up after the outcry 

Tou Vue takes down the display. He said if he decorates next year 'we'll just do ghosts and goblins'

'Displays of an offensive nature are not reflective of Army values and the family-friendly environment provided for employees and residents of the Fort Campbell community,' she said.

Carpenter also said the homeowner apologized, and that he  had not wished to offend.

The Army Times pointed out that WFLA's Facebook commenters have argued online about if the decorations are racist or not. 

Other commenters on Facebook have argued a moment in the film 'Sinister' was actually recreated by the decorations, the media outlet reported. 

Carpenter told The Army Times 'while there was no discussion with investigators of the particular theme it represented, this particular decoration exceeded our community standards.'
