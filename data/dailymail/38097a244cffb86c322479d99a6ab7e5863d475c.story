A child was pulled out of a middle-school history class in Massachusetts by his father because his class was going to discuss Islam. 

Anthony Giannino reacted after seeing a section in a Revere Public Schools worksheet describing the Islamic call to prayer, part of which  states, 'I bear witness that there is no God but Allah'. 

He said he pulled his son out of class because his family didn't believe in Allah and he didn't think his child needed to learn about him at school.

In an interview with WHDH-TV Mr Giannino said: 'No religion should be taught at school. In their paper it says Allah is their only God. That's insulting to me as a Christian who believes in just Jesus only.'

Revere Public School has said that Mr Giannino's son had been out of the class since he complained earlier this month, and as a result would likely receive an incomplete in his history course.

Revere Public Schools Superintendent Paul Dakin told the Huffington Post that the school was teaching history, not religion, and that Massachusetts requires middle schools to cover such topics.

Following Mr Giannino's complaint Mr Dakin sent a letter to parents in which he described 'misinformation circulating about the teaching of religion in our middle school social studies classrooms'.

The letter details what subjects are taught during what years - World History is taught in grade 8 - and said all of the classwork was based on Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks. 

It said: 'These documents identify the specific learning standards and concepts and skills for each grade level and each content area.'

And goes on to say that 'no religion is taught with the purpose of converting students to that religion, insulting their own religious beliefs, or promoting the beliefs of one religion as superior to the beliefs of another'.

Mr Dakin told the Huffington Post that it would be impossible to teach history accurately without explaining the importance of religious faith.

If schools had to 'purge all the religion out of all the history we teach,' he said, 'we wouldn't be able to talk about the Pilgrims or Plymouth, ... about why they were coming [to America] because of religious beliefs.'
