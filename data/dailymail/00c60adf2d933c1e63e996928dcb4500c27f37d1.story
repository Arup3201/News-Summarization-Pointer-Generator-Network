Chased: A burglar ran terrified from a home when he was chased away by a tiny Yorkshire Terrier (not photographed)

Lions and tigers and Yorkies, oh my! 

A South African burglar was caught on surveillance camera trying to sneak into a house, instead he was chased away by a dog, facing his worst fear -- literally, as he has cynophobia, an abnormal fear of dogs.

In an approximately 40 second video captured Nov. 13, the perpetrator is seen snooping around the backyard of a home. 

He goes out of frame for less than three seconds before bursting across the yard and over the wooden fence trying to get away from a tiny Yorkshire Terrier. 

The tiny terrier appears to be barking as he chases the man off of his territory. As the man clears the fence, the tiny dog is seen doing, what can only be described as, a victory spin.

Yorkshire Terriers are typically between eight and nine inches tall and usually weigh between four and six pounds.   

OV reports that the burglar was arrested four days after the incident.

The video has more than half a million views on YouTube and nearly one million views on Reddit, where it was originally posted.
