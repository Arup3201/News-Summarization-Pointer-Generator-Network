Two murderers serving life sentences have been accidentally released from a Florida prison after they forged court paperwork.

Charles Walker and Joseph Jenkins, both 34, walked from Franklin Correctional Institution in Carrabelle in the last month after officials acted on falsified documents that had apparently come from the Orange County Clerk of Courts.

The documents declared that both prisoners' sentences had been reduced from their original 15 years. Walker was set free on Tuesday and Jenkins was released on September 27.

Walker was serving life for a second-degree murder committed in Orange County in April 1999.

He told investigators at the time that he had intended to frighten 23-year-old Cedric Slater whom he said had been intimidating him. Walker fired three shots, one of which struck Slater and killed him. 

Jenkins was also serving life in prison for the first-degree murder of a father of six in Orlando in September 1998.

Jenkins and his cousin Angelo Pearson had planned a home invasion at the home of Roscoe Pugh, 28. The father of six died from gunshot wounds. 

Pearson is also serving a life sentence at the Wakulla Correctional Institution in Crawfordville.

A desperate manhunt is now underway to find the two escapees who both have extensive criminal histories. At least one of the escaped convicts could be in Orange County because he once lived there.

The Florida Department of Corrections is investigating how authorities were duped by the fake documents.

Spokeswoman Jessica Cary told the Orlando Sentinel: 'I don't know how it happened.'

A search for both inmates on the Florida Department of Corrections website returns the message: 'There was an error retrieving the details about the selected offender.'
