A New York mom-of-three spent Mother's Day in jail after she crashed her car into a telephone pole while driving with her kids - and then allegedly took them by the hand and attempted to flee the scene.

Police in Long Island said Sarah Knakal, 30, was driving drunk around 6p.m. Saturday when her SUV struck the pole and a nearby signpost.

She then allegedly shoved an officer before rounding up her daughters, aged 5, 7 and 9, and trying to run away.

She was arrested nearby about 10 minutes later.

No one was injured in the crash.

The stay-at-home mom was charged with aggravated driving while intoxicated under Leandra's Law, leaving the scene of an accident and endangering the welfare of a child.

The 2009 law making drunk driving with a child a felony.

She plead not guilty at a court hearing Sunday in First District Court in Central Islip.

She arrived in handcuffs and was ordered held in lieu of $30,000 bail, Newsday reported.

Her attorney, Jerome Binder, told the newspaper Mrs Knakal had not been drinking, insisting 'She would never endanger her children knowingly.'

'She loves her children. Her parents were killed in an accident during [her] high school [years], so she knows the value of family,' he said.

Binder added that Mrs Knakal's blood test has not come back, and therefore there is not yet any evidence that she was intoxicated.

She was not charged for the run in with the officer.

Child Protective Services was notified and returned the children to their father, Ryan Knakal, who lives at a separate address.

Mr Knakal, 32, also attended the court appearance and described his wife as 'a great mother.'

'Sarah's kids love her,' he said, according to Newsday. 'They love their mother and that will never change.'

However, due to a protective order they were not allowed to see her on Mother's Day.

She is due back in court on May 16.
