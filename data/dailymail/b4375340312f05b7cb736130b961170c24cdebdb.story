Has God revealed himself in a cloud over Florida? You'll have to be the judge.

Writing at the Huffington Post,Â  blogger Fiona Finn posted the picture she said was taken by her boss on his way home from work in Cape Coral, Florida.

Finn describes herself as an 'author, mother, cancer survivor, and parodist.'

Writing at the Huffington Post,  blogger Fiona Finn posted a picture of 'God' she said was taken by her boss on his way home from work in Cape Coral, Florida

'And what was immediately obvious was the fact that 
this cloud was shaped in the image of the Lord,' Finn wrote. 'Also look to the far 
right and  you'll see another cloud that looks like an angel with a 
trumpet in hand.  Maybe it's the angel Gabriel blowing a trumpet blast 
to indicate the Lord's return to Earth, or maybe not...

'I realize 
that some may see this as a sign, an act of God if you will,' she continued. 'There will
 be others, those who will doubt.  And that's okay.  But one thing's for
 sure, and that's how remarkably clear this image in the sky really is. 
 Believe it or not, God is said to work in mysterious ways.'

Finn's post has sparked a discussion with more than 1,400 comments.

This is the second time this summer someone has come forward with a picture they believe may have found the almighty in the sky.

This July, The Telegraph reported that amateur photographer Jeremy Fletcher snapped such an image while on an evening walk in Norfolk.

'I realised the image looked remarkably like a face of a man 
  with a beard so I took a number of shots on my phone,' Fletcher said. 'The face appeared to 
  be looking back towards the shore.'

The Telegraph remained somewhat skeptical, writing that it could just as easily be the face of Sean Connery or Karl Marx.

But in Finn's case, she's convinced.

'I for one was blown away by 
this photo and yes, I believe it's a real snapshot of God in the clouds,' Finn wrote.
