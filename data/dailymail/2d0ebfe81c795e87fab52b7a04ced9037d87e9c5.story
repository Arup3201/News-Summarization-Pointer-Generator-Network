A South Florida woman who offered police officers $30,000 to help kill her newlywed husband and another man was yesterday arrested and charged with solicitation of murder.

Annybelkis Terrero, 38, was working as a police informant when she allegedly made the bribe.

The incident began several weeks ago when police were called to Terrero's home in Boynton Beach, south of Palm Beach, amid complaints of drug activity and prostitution.

When members of the narcotics investigation unit arrived at the house Terrero agreed to act as a confidential informant.

She signed paperwork that agreed to show police where a drug dealer lived.

As Terrero and the officers drove to the house, Terrero discussed how she hated her husband and wanted him dead.

'She wanted her husband dead and that she had come up with a plan to do it,' Boynton Beach Police Spokeswoman Stephanie Slater told NBC News 4.

The officers then started to play along.

'At that point the agents switched gears, assumed the roles of undercover officers and implied that they could help her with her wish to have her husband killed,' Ms Slater said.

'At that point she produced two stolen credit cards as a down payment and gave it to the officers.'

Police said Terrero told them to use the credit cards quickly because they were 'hot'.

On Thursday night, Terrero met with the two officers and an undercover Boynton Beach officer who was posing as a hit man at a shopping center parking lot.

Terrero brought a fully-loaded shotgun and ammunition to the meeting and offered it to the hit man as a down payment and sign of good faith, police said.

She also agreed to pay $30,000 and said the money would come from her husband's life insurance policy once the job was done.

The agreement was that another man, an acquaintance, would also be killed.

Terrero was then arrested and charged with two counts of solicitation of murder and two counts of bribery.

She is being held without bond at the Palm Beach County Jail.
