An Olympic coach who helped to bring the 2012 Games' sailing events to Weymouth was crushed to death in an avalanche while skiing, an inquest heard today.

David Robinson had been out on the slopes with wife Christine Hughes and a group of friends when the couple were engulfed in the torrent of snow.

His chest was crushed by the impact of the thick snow piling on top of him and he was trapped, unconscious, while his friends and rescuers desperately tried to find him.

The 67-year-old father of two, who once coached Great Britain’s sailing team, was eventually found and taken to hospital but died the following day.

Speaking at the conclusion of the inquest into her husband’s death today, Ms Hughes, said that she had been 'spooked' that the hearing had taken place in the midst of the Olympic sailing competition. Mr Robinson had put forward Weymouth, Dorset, as a venue for the games.

'It’s quite poignant this, that the inquest, was done in the middle of the Olympics,' she said. 'He was an ex-Olympic sailing coach and it was his idea that they had the sailing at Weymouth when he was the Olympic coach in 1970.

'He would have been absolutely over the moon that they have held the sailing there.

'He had registered to be a volunteer at the 2012 Olympics and he had suggested that Weymouth would have been a great venue.'

Ms Hughes said that her husband had been appointed as one of sailing’s first Olympic coaches in 1970 in preparation for the 1972 games in Munich.

'He had such a love of life, he had so much charisma,' she added. 'He used to say that the best things in life were the sea and the mountains, it’s a shame that it was one of those loves that took him from us so soon.

'However, he would not have wanted it any other way.'

As keen skiiers, Mr Robinson and Ms Hughes, from the Hamble, Southampton, were frequent visitors to the Alpine ski resort of Val d’Isere and had been staying there over Christmas in 2010.

On Boxing Day they and a group of friends had gone out for an 'off piste' trek on the Combe de Signal slope, aided by professional instructor Wayne Watson.

The inquest at Winchester Coroner’s Court, Hampshire, was told that all of them were experienced skiiers but would always go out with Mr Watson, a friend of the couple, for safety reasons.

The group had been out at around 8.30am, the morning after snow had fallen in the area - where the risk of an avalanche was relatively low.

As part of a further attempt to stay safe they were told to stay around 50ft apart, and Ms Hughes said that each skiier would wait until the one in front of them had cleared the section before setting off.

However, one skiier was believed to have stopped unexpectedly - leading French investigators to suspect that the snow mantle had become overloaded, causing the avalanche.

Ms Hughes said that she had been standing on the slope when she heard a 'woomph' noise and saw cracks appearing in the snow beneath her.

'The whole thing started to go sideways, I was thinking about what was happening to me,' she said, explaining that she had not seen her husband.

'When I started to go sideways I was on my own there with the snow starting to move, that’s when I thought maybe I should pull my handle.'

Each skiier in the group was wearing a backpack with an emergency air bag they could deploy to prevent them from being trapped under the snow.

Ms Hughes said she had struggled to inflate her air bags, and was only able to do so once she had already fallen into the snow.

'I was face down in the snow, it was only when I heard the charge go off that I knew the balloons had inflated,' she said.

Despite not inflating fully, the bright orange balloons still made her easy for rescuers to spot - unlike Mr Robinson, who was unable to deploy his.

The inquest heard that it took rescuers around 20 minutes to find him, trapped under one metre of snow and having suffered a cardio-respiratory arrest.

He was taken to hospital in nearby Grenoble but died the following day.

A post-mortem examination revealed that his cause of death had been fractured ribs and trauma to the chest, although he also had bruises to his head.

Grahame Short, coroner for Central Hampshire, said that he was in no doubt that Mr Robinson was an experienced skiier and that all safety precautions necessary had been taken.

'It’s fair to say that avalanches can be caused by many factors, it was probably as a result of the skiiers on the slope in the area at the same time,' he said. 'That is an inherent risk of skiing.

'The avalanche started and although Ms Hughes was able to inflate her air bag I don’t think that Mr Robinson had a chance to do so because it happened so quickly.'

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Short told Ms Hughes that she had been lucky to escape unharmed from the avalanche.

'So much in these events is an element of chance and he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.'
