The brother of police officer Ahmed Merabet (pictured) who was executed in the street by the Charlie Hebdo gunmen described them as 'madmen'

The family of a Muslim police officer shot dead by the Charlie Hebdo killers has described them as 'madmen' with 'no religion'.

Malik Merabet said the death of Ahmed Merabet, 42,  was a 'waste' and pleaded for unity, saying Islam must not be conflated with extremism.

Mr Merabet was the last of the 12 victims slain in the terror attack on French satirical newspaper.

A police officer, he was the son of immigrants from mainly Muslim North Africa and was shot dead on the sidewalk by one of the assailants as they started their getaway. 

Video footage taken by an onlooker that surfaced on the Internet after the attack appeared to show a wounded Mr Merabet on the pavement, raising a hand as though appealing for mercy before he was fatally shot in the head by one of the three gunmen. 

The massacre was condemned around the world as an assault on freedom of speech. The magazine, which mocks politicians and religions alike, was firebombed in 2011 after carrying a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed. 

During an emotional news conference Mr Merabet's brother broke down when asked about graphic images of the police officer lying injured on a pavement and apparently raising his arms in defence before one of the gunmen shot him dead at close range.

Mr Merabet said his brother was 'very proud' to represent the police and 'defend the values' of the French Republic.

He said: 'Thanks to his determination, he became a judicial police officer. Companions described him as someone who loved his job.

People lay flowers and candles outside the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris today in memory of the victims

'He was committed. He looked after his mother and his close family. He was a pillar of the family. He was a very protective father, a lovely brother, a loving companion.'

He said the family was 'devastated by this barbaric act', adding: 'We are devastated for all the victims.'

He went on: 'I am addressing myself to all racists - the Islamophobes and the anti-Semites: You must not mix up extremism with Muslims.

'The madmen have no colour nor religion. Stop ... having wars or burning mosques or burning synagogues because you are attacking people.

This woman's sign says 'Stop killing in our name. Terrorism has no religion. #JeSuisAhmed

A campaign of support for the satirical newspaper spread after the attack, using the slogan 'Je Suis Charlie'

'My brother was Muslim and he was killed by two terrorists, by two false Muslims.

'Islam is a religion of peace and love. As far as my brother's death is concerned it was a waste.'

Of the killers - brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi - he said: 'I am glad they were stopped.'

As details of Mr Merabet's death became known, a campaign of solidarity quickly caught fire on social media on Thursday, using the phrase 'Je Suis Ahmed' - I Am Ahmed.

It echoed the campaign of support for the satirical newspaper that spread after the attack, using the slogan 'Je Suis Charlie.'

Mr Merabet, originally from Livry-Gargan in north eastern Paris, had been a fully-trained police officer for eight years. 

His death also drew the attention at the United Nations.

'He himself was a Muslim,' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters. 'This is yet another reminder of what we are facing together. It should never be seen as a war of religion, for religion, or on religion. It is an assault on our common humanity, designed to terrify and incite.'

Tributes for Mr Merabet have continued to pour in, with one person writing: 'RIP Ahmed Merabet, French policeman, murdered protecting people in Paris', while Alan Mendoza said: 'Important to note that amid the carnage today a brave Muslim policeman was murdered by those claiming to represent Islam.'

The second police officer to be killed in the attack was Franck Brinsolaro, 49, a brigadier and protection officer for the magazine's editor Stephane Charbonnier.
