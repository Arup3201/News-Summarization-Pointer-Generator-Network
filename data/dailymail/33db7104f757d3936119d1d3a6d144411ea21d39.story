Newlyweds Stacie and Edgar Cobos got more than they bargained during a game drive on their Serengeti Safari Camp in Northern Tanzania.

The honeymooners, from Washington DC, were on a game drive when a cheetah got a little too close for comfort - jumping on the car and peering through the open sunroof.

The couple had been happily observing the family of cheetahs when the big cats decided to use the car as a perch so they could get a better view of their surroundings.

But one cheetah became more interested in the contents of the car than the surrounding plains, peering through the sunroof and, at one moment, looking like it may even try to get inside.

As Edgar Cobos stayed stock still looking at the animal from the back seat, the big cat looked right back, before appearing to lose interest.

The heart-stopping moment came as the newlyweds were enjoying a safari camp experience with The Luxury Safari Company.

The trip involves travelling through the Serengeti with a mobile camp of just six tents, following the migration and wildlife movement around the Serengeti.

Guests have the opportunity to camp and dine under the stars of the Kuka Hills in the North Eastern Serengeti, while always being positioned in an exceptional wildlife area.

The nature of the safari means holidaymakers can venture further away from other tourists and often get much closer to the animals.

Stumbling upon cheetah is nothing out of the ordinary in the Serengeti, which has long been famed as one of the most beautiful, wildlife-rich areas of Africa.

In the North West region of Tanzania, it shares an invisible border with Kenya's Masai Mara, spanning 30,000 sq km.

Aside from cheetah-spotting, wildebeest are also frequently seen, particularly during the country's annual wildebeest migration, which lasts for approximately 8-9 months of the year.

Rose Hipwood, founder of The Luxury Safari Company said, 'Tourism drives conservation in Africa.

'If it wasn't for tourists, much of the land would have been taken over and the animals wiped out - it seems these cheetah have found another way that the tourists protecting them can help them!'

Stays at Serengeti Safari Camp in Tanzania start at £2,643 for four nights, all inclusive, including flights from the UK.
