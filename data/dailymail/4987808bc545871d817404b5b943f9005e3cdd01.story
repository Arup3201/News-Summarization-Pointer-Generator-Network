Supercop: William Bratton is being brought in as an adviser but has staked a claim for the top Met job

David Cameron's new adviser on gang warfare would be prepared to become a British citizen to become head of the Met Police.

American 'supercop' Bill Bratton has told friends he is prepared to swap his nationality if it made any difference to the selection process for the country's top police job.

Mr Bratton, credited with turning around the New York Police Department and its Los Angeles counterpart, said he believed an outsider could reinvigorate a police force.

He told the Guardian: 'I've been an outsider in every department I've worked in. Bureaucrats change processes, leaders change culture.

'I think of myself as a transformational leader who changes cultures.'

It came as police chiefs and Boris Johnson made an outspoken attack yesterday on David Cameron's calls for zero tolerance policing.

In a new broadside about plans for 20 per cent budget cuts to the police, the Mayor of London insisted that crime will come down only if there are more police on the streets.

Senior policemen angrily denounced 
Home Secretary Theresa May for suggesting that it was politicians who 
turned around the initially sluggish police response to last week’s 
riots.

Sir Hugh Orde, 
president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, complained that 
commanders had their hands tied by human rights laws.

The increasingly acrimonious relationship between politicians and police gained new impetus yesterday when Mr Cameron signalled his support for Mr Bratton’s zero tolerance approach to cleaning up crime when he ran the police departments in New York and Los Angeles.

Mr Bratton was initially mooted as the next Metropolitan Police Commissioner - a positions in which he said he was 'seriously interested - but the idea was blocked by Mrs May. Instead, Mr Bratton will join a taskforce on gangs.

In an interview published yesterday, Mr Cameron said: ‘We haven’t talked the language of zero tolerance enough but the message is getting through.’

Sir Hugh Orde said tough U.S. tactics advocated by Mr Bratton would not be possible in Britain because of the European Convention on Human Rights.

He said: ‘I am not sure I want to learn about gangs from an area of America that has 400 of them. It seems to me, if you’ve got 400 gangs, then you’re not being very effective.

'If you look at the style of policing in the States, and their levels of violence, they are fundamentally different from here.’

He added: ‘What I suggested to the Home Secretary is a more sensible approach, maybe to look across far wider styles of policing and – more usefully – at European styles; they, like us, are bound by the European Convention.’

In an interview in today's Guardian Bratton said his position within the Met was no different to Orde's in Northern Ireland when he too was an outsider as an Englishman.

Mr Bratton said: 'I find it ironical the hue and cry about outsiders,' adding that he had faced similar situations in New York and LA.

He added: 'The Met is having its share of issues and leadership crises, certainly. It is a mirror image of when I went into the NYPD and LAPD, and both those cities turned out quite well.

'I've been an outsider in every department I've worked in. Bureaucrats change processes, leaders change culture. I think of myself as a transformational leader who changes cultures.'

In a further crack at zero tolerance plans, Chief Constable Chris Sims of West Midlands Police said he would not be ‘slavishly adopting empty slogans’.

‘Officers have been overwhelmed by the support shown by the public and it feels a million miles from the debates apparently raging in Westminster,’ he said.

Mr Bratton, who will advise a Government taskforce on gangs, said yesterday that he had cut murders in New York by nearly half and gang crimes in LA by 60 per cent in eight years.

‘I do know about gangs. I understand the way they operate, the way they generate and the need for the Government to tackle them head on,’ he said.

He added that British gangs are ‘much smaller and less sophisticated than in LA. Still, there are certain methods that have proved very successful in America which could be used to great effect here’.

He said he would employ injunctions limiting the movement of gang members, higher sentences for crimes committed by gangs, and ex-gang members as ‘interventionists’ to steer current members away from gangs.

But Boris Johnson used the news to reopen his offensive against police cuts. He pointed out that Mr Bratton cut crime in New York and Los Angeles only because he flooded the streets with police.

The Mayor said: ‘His particular success in tackling crime in New York was very much due to a huge ramp up in numbers from about 30,000 to 42,000 officers in New York, that was instrumental in his success.

'In the end there’s going to have to be an argument about money. The case I make to Government and I’m going to continue to make is that numbers matter. People need to see police out there on the streets.’

Police chiefs began speaking out last week after Mr Cameron and Mrs May both criticised the initial police response to the riots and then sought to claim credit for the deployment of 16,000 officers on the streets of London.

MP Mark Pritchard, secretary of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said: ‘Sir Hugh Orde’s very public and ill-judged remarks underline the need for the Coalition Government to push ahead with elected police commissioners.

‘Senior officers are not a law unto themselves and should not think they have a monopoly of wisdom.’

Tory MP Dominic Raab said Sir Hugh’s comments about human rights were ‘daft’.

‘There is no serious human rights reason for not learning lessons from U.S. experience of visible, robust and pro-active policing, and tailoring them to Britain,’ he said. ‘It’s sound policy and exactly what the public want to see now.’

Last night the Home Affairs Select Committee announced plans for an inquiry into the riots to find out where to apportion the blame and the credit.

Mr Johnson, Mrs May, Mr Bratton and the bosses of mobile phone companies used by the rioters to co-ordinate their looting will be summoned to give evidence.

Chairman Keith Vaz sent pointed questions to police chiefs around the country asking how many officers they deployed on each day of the riots, who ordered the surge in police numbers and whether they have the resources they need.
