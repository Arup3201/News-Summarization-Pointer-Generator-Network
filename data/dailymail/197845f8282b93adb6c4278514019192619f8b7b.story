Daley Blind admits the high tempo of the Premier League left him feeling 'a little tired' during his first weeks at Manchester United.

The 24-year-old midfielder followed his former Holland boss Louis van Gaal to Old Trafford last summer, completing a £14million deal on transfer deadline day.

Blind has made 14 appearances in the Premier League this season, netting two goals for the Red Devils and he admits he was taken aback by the pace of the Premier League.

'The biggest difference is the Premier League is played at a much higher tempo,' he told Inside United.

'When I played my first games here, I noticed the difference and was a little tired. The tempo is definitely much higher here.' 

'In Holland, you have some points in a game when you can say, "Okay, let's have a rest for a few minutes and play the ball around".'

Blind was also full of praise for boss Van Gaal and appreciates his manager's honesty.

'I really admire that he's always himself,' he explained. 'He's always really honest to everyone about his ideas and what he wants.

'I think that's a good thing in a person because you know where you stand as a player. That's what I really admire about him.'
