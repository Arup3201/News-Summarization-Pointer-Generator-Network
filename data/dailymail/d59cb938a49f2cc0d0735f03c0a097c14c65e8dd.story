Barclays bank is embroiled in yet more controversy after three of its employees were ordered to stand trial for alleged tax fraud.

They were among 20 people charged with fraud at Italian bank UniCredit, stemming from a scheme set up by Barclays, which denies any wrongdoing.

The case comes as a blow for Barclays as it tries to cast off its reputation for aggressive tax avoidance.

Probe: Barclays is embroiled in yet more controversy after three of its employees were ordered to stand trial for alleged tax fraud

A Milan judge yesterday ordered top Italian banker Alessandro Profumo and 19 others to go on trial.

The case centres on suspected tax 
fraud in 2007 and 2008 at Unicredit, arising from 
the use of a complex Luxembourg-based offshore financial scheme 
provided by Barclays.

Barclays is alleged to have enabled 
UniCredit to earn interest of around 20 per cent in 2007 – around five 
times the amount it could have achieved on the inter-bank market.

Unicredit allegedly evaded €245m (£198m) in tax.

Mr Profumo, who was UniCredit chief executive at the time, said in a statement that he was looking forward to the trial, 'so that an end can be put to the reputational damage which I am de facto, though unjustly, suffering'.

Mr Profumo, who is now the chairman of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy’s third largest lender, is accused of authorising the operation, judicial and investigative sources told news agency Reuters.

In a separate statement, UniCredit said it was confident the trial would clear bank and its former and current employees.

The first hearing is scheduled for October 1, Reuters reported.   

Boss: Bob Diamond, chief executive of Barclays, last month launched a drive to restore trust and burnish his bank's dented image

Barclays said it believed neither it nor any of the individuals involved had violated any laws in Italy.

A spokesman said: 'Barclays takes its responsibilities as a  corporate citizen very seriously, complying with taxation laws in the UK and in all the countries where we do business.

'Barclays continues to believe firmly that it and the individuals involved have not violated any tax or other laws in Italy, and we continue to support fully the individuals named in this matter.'

Campaign group 
ActionAid revealed in a report last year that Barclays has 174 offshoots on the tax 
haven of the Cayman Islands.

And in April, it emerged that Bob Diamond, chief executive of Barclays, would receive millions of pounds on top of his lavish pay and bonus package to cover his tax bills.

The bank was savaged for writing a 'blank cheque' to its American-born boss.

Shareholders were already outraged that Barclays covered a £5.m tax bill run up by Mr Diamond last year, lifting his pay package to almost £27m.

Last month, Mr Diamond launched a  'Citizenship Plan' as part of a drive to restore trust and burnish his bank's dented image – but offered no blueprint for reforming pay.

The three-year plan, unveiled at the bank’s Canary Wharf headquarters, aimed to support local communities, contribute to economic growth and improve integrity and service to customers.

Confident: Alessandro Profumo has said he will clear his name at trial

Under the blueprint, Barclays made commitments to lend at least £150bn to households and to provide at least £50bn to small and medium-sized firms.

The bank also said it would boost apprenticeship and work experience programmes to help young unemployed people start careers.

Outside of the UK it is helping micro-entrepreneurs in Africa.

It has also made a commitment to draw up plans that would allow Barclays to fail without bringing down the financial system.

Mr Diamond said: 'Taxpayers’ money should never again be put at risk. Ever.’

Campaigners dismissed the initiative as 'cynical PR' and 'frankly insulting' to ordinary people bearing the brunt of the financial crisis.

On the issue of bankers' fat pay cheques and bonuses, Mr Diamond said: 'We recognise the scepticism and cynicism.

'Levels of pay continue to be causes of concern.

'But we believe banks have a critical role in putting things right as the private sector must take on the role of boosting economic growth.'
