Novak Djokovic gives the thumbs up at Indian Wells

Novak Djokovic progressed to the fourth round of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells with a comfortable 7-5 6-3 victory over Albert Ramos-Vinolas.

The world No 1 rarely looked troubled as he put together a straight sets triumph over Spaniard Ramos-Vinolas, who is yet to win an ATP Tour title.

Djokovic, who would collect a 50th career gong should he defend his championship in the Coachella Valley, must now challenge home favourite John Isner for a place in the quarter-finals.

The big-serving American fired down 18 aces as he found his way past Kevin Anderson 7-6 (8/6) 6-2 in a touch under one hour and 20 minutes.

Fourth and fifth seeds Andy Murray and Kei Nishikori are safely through after overcoming Philipp Kohlschreiber and Fernando Verdasco respectively.

Murray took a first set in 25 minutes but in the end needed the best part of two hours to overcome Kohlschreiber 6-1 3-6 6-1 while Japan's Nishikori recovered from an early wobble to edge out Verdasco 6-7 (6/8) 6-1 6-4.

Awaiting Murray is Adrian Mannarino following the Frenchman's 6-4 6-4 triumph over Ernests Gulbis and Nishikori's next opponent is Feliciano Lopez.

The 12th seed from Spain was kept busy until the small hours but eventually completed a 6-2 4-6 6-3 victory over Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay.

Also progressing in California were Bernard Tomic - the 7-5 6-4 conqueror of eighth seed David Ferrer - and surprise package Thanasi Kokkinakis.

Australia's world No 124 went the distance in a meeting with the experienced Juan Monaco that the 18-year-old won 6-2 5-7 7-6 (7/5) in nearly two hours and 47 minutes.

In the women's draw, second seed Maria Sharapova battled her way past fierce rival Victoria Azarenka to reach the last 16.

The Russian was inferior on her percentages throughout a bruising encounter between two multiple grand slam champions but nevertheless it was Azarenka who found herself saving five match points before succumbing to a 6-4 6-3 defeat.

Next up for the world No 2 is a meeting with the defending champion, Flavia Pennetta of Italy, who dispatched Sam Stosur 6-4 6-2.

Making an early exit was fourth seed Caroline Wozniacki, the victim of a 6-4 6-4 win for Belinda Bencic, while Serbian hopeful Ana Ivanovic was eliminated 6-2 5-7 6-2 by Caroline Garcia.

Eugenie Bouchard saw off Coco Vandeweghe 6-3 6-2 with qualifier Lesia Tsurenko ousting Alize Cornet 7-5 1-6 6-2 as Jelena Jankovic defeated Madison Keys 5-7 6-4 6-3.

Elsewhere, Sabine Lisicki of Germany called time on 11th seed Sara Errani's campaign with a 6-4 6-2 triumph completed late on Monday night.
