The Olympics and Paralympics may be over, but the insect world is stepping into the breach with some incredible displays of synchronised gymnastics.

The clever caterpillars were snapped showing off their moves in front of the watchful eye of amateur photographer Aleksandr Chorny near the River Teterev, Ukraine.

He captured the six-strong party of acrobatic caterpillars who seemed delighted with the opportunity to show off their balancing acts whilst carefully clinging on to the side of a leaf.

The caterpillars were captured in a series of perfectly executed synchonised moves by a Ukranian photographer

The Ermine moth caterpillar, native 
to British-like climates, measure in at just 1.5cm.

They tend to move in large groups.

They are known to coat large areas with thick silk webs up to 20 feet long.

The Ukranian photographer has only been working behind the camera for the past three years and has now turned his hand to specializing in macro -photography.

He was taken by surprise by the creative performance when he was out walking along the river.

As the sun goes down they often come to life and start nibbling their way through leaves and plants but these ones seemed more interested in trying out their dance routines than getting their daily meal.

Green-fingered gardeners are likely to find ermine caterpillars like these a bit of a pest as they're famed for creating whopping silk webs up to 20 foot long.

Whilst the webs may look like beautiful works of nature, they're capable of destroying gardeners' hard- grown plants which become cocooned under the webs to be used later for the caterpillar's lunch.Aleksandr, 28, a full-time artist, caught the creepy crawlies on an Olympus E-3 camera over an hour- long period.

These congo-ing caterpillars have been caught taking to the stage to display their well- rehearsed version of the famous Conga party dance near the River Teterev in Northern Ukraine

He said: 'I was totally amazed by how peculiar their behavior was because I'd never seen anything like this before.

'When I tried to blow on them, their tails kept getting higher and higher until they were almost standing up vertically.

'It was as if they were reacting to the movement of air.

'I loved seeing the different ways that their bodies could move and watching them felt like I was at a circus show.

'This type of macro photography is my favourite because it gives people the ability to see the hidden world and the beautiful things that can't normally be seen by the naked eye.'

The incredible insects also appear to be doing handstands in one of the shots
