New Hampshire police say a man who broke into his neighbor's apartment to silence a barking dog ended up getting bitten and arrested.

They say a brawl erupted Friday morning when Roger Pelletier forced his way into the Portsmouth apartment because he was frustrated by the constant barking of her Shih Tzu, Oreo.

Police say Pelletier tried to strangle Oreo, leading to a confrontation with the dog's owner. 

They say Oreo bit Pelletier several times. The dog's owner wasn't injured.

Oreo has been taken to a veterinarian for evaluation.

Pelletier is charged with burglary, cruelty to animals and simple assault.

He is jailed on $5,000 bail and will be held until he's arraigned Monday. He can't be reached for comment in jail.

It's unknown if he has a lawyer.
