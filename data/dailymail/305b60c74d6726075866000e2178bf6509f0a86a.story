The nation's love of live sport continues to grow with an astonishing 67 million tickets sold for events held in the United Kingdom in 2014, it has been revealed.

The 2014 total falls short of the record 75m who attended UK sports events in 2012, according to analysis by the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. But if the figures for the London Olympic and Paralympic Games are removed, attendances at all other professional sports events grew by three per cent in the two years.

Football remains by far the nation's favourite sport, with a whopping 42.8m attending live matches across the 12 months. The Premier League (13.9m) and the Championship (9.4m) boasted the first and fourth highest aggregate attendances of any domestic football leagues across Europe during the 2013-14 season.

Glasgow's Commonwealth Games became Scotland's best ever attended sports event, with 1.3m tickets sold for its 11 days of competition.

Wimbledon has long been the best attended annual sporting event in the UK - mainly thanks to its 13-day duration. Once again the All England Club claimed game, set and match over its rival events, with almost half a million spectators flocking to SW19 to watch Andy Murray's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to defend his crown from Novak Djokovic and the rest.

The ATP Tour Finals, also won by Djokovic, at London's 02 Arena attracted 264,000 visitors, meaning tennis accounts for two of the top-four best-attended events of the year.

Golf also takes two spots in the top 10, with the Ryder Cup, won by Europe at Gleneagles, fifth on the list with 240,000 spectators. Almost as many fans witnessed Rory McIlroy win his first Open Championship at Hoylake, as 203,000 crammed into Royal Liverpool Golf Club in July.

Silverstone’s 50th British Grand Prix, won by Lewis Hamilton in front of his home fans in July, attracted 298,000 spectators to make it the second best-attended event in the UK.

But horseracing continues to be the UK’s second most popular sport - five of the top 10 are occupied by equestrian events.

Glasgow 2014 does not make the top 10 because some of its events were free to attend. And the headline figure of 67m would have been even higher if free sporting events counted towards the overall total. Around 4.8m cycling fans lined the route of the three UK stages of the Tour de France in 2014. Hundreds of thousands also attended the London Marathon.

The good news for British sports fans is that 2015 looks set to be another bumper year. Rugby union's World Cup, held in England and Wales, is expected to lure 2.3m visitors. This would be 46 per cent of the total number who attended rugby union matches in the 2013-14 season, which amounted to 4.9m.
