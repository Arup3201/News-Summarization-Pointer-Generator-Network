Windfall: Kimberly Smedley earned at least $1.3 million from her illegal butt enhancement business, where she injected clients with industrial silicone

An unlicensed cosmetic surgeon has been sentenced for injecting customers' buttocks with commercial silicone in hotel rooms and using glue and cotton balls to prevent the substance from leaking out.

Kimberly Smedley, 47, of Atlanta was sentenced to three years in prison yesterday in federal court in Baltimore.

She was also ordered to pay a $25,000 fine and more than $8,000 in restitution.

According to her plea agreement, Smedley administered the injections in hotel rooms in several cities, using silicone intended to be used for metal or plastic lubrication, as an additive for paint and coatings, and as furniture or automotive polish.

The customers, who wanted their buttocks enlarged, paid between $500 and $1,600 in cash for each session.

Federal prosecutors believe Smedley  made at least $1.3 million while operating her illegal practice out of hotel rooms in Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York.

Ahead of her sentencing on Thursday on a  federal conspiracy charge, prosecutors said a forensic accountant's 
review of Smedley's bank accounts found $1.513 million in receipts 
related to the practice.

She kept the silicone in a water jug for the procedures - and used 'super glue with cotton balls to prevent silicone leaking out' of the women's flesh.

She charged '$500 and $1,600, always in cash, for 
each session where she typically injected silicone in nine places on each 
side of the buttocks', according to court papers.

She ordered nearly 5,000 pounds of silicone from one manufacturer alone, The Smoking Gun reported.

Smedley, from Atlanta, Georgia, told 
clients that the silicone was medical grade.

However it was actually 
intended for metal or plastic lubrication, as an additive for paint and 
coatings, and furniture or automotive polishes, according to Baltimore 
district court.

The therapist offered to inject the chemical 'into the buttocks of customers for larger and fuller buttocks in exchange for money' according to The Smoking Gun. 

Many of her customers between 2003 and 2011 were strippers.

Lavish life: Smedley, 45, (with unidentified male) charged $500 to $1,600 each time for silicone injections

She had used her earnings to fund a 
lavish lifestyle, driving a luxury SUV and living in an exclusive 
Altanta neighbourhood where homes are worth around $500,000.

Smedley
was investigated last year after one woman fell seriously ill from 
receiving silicone injections. She was arrested at a hotel in Washington
D.C. as she was preparing to see customers.

In 2008 investigation by the New York Post, Smedley said: 'I can't tell if you'll have scars or not. You have to know your 
own body. You need to be sure of what you're doing. I'm not promising 
anything.'

Illegal silicone injections, often 
used by sex workers and those in the transgender community to alter 
their appearance, are incredibly dangerous and even life-threatening.

Makeshift practice: Smedley reportedly saw clients in hotel rooms across the U.S. to administer injections including this one in downtown Washington D.C.

Dr
M.R. Khalifeh, a plastic surgeon, told Fox: 'We see 
long-term effects six months to a year later. The silicone can bubble 
to the surface and cause chronic infections. It is really difficult to 
treat.'

Smedley's actions came to light after
another practitioner of illegal silicone buttock injections was jailed 
earlier this year.

Padge-Victoria Windslowe, a transgender 
hip-hop singer who calls herself 'Black Madam', faced charges in connection with the
killing of a woman who died after a botched bottom implant.

Windslowe, 42, was about to host a 'pumping party' in Philadelphia, where women receive black market implants, when she was apprehended.

An unidentified 23-year-old woman was treated for a blocked artery in the lung and spent 
seven days in hospital. She later died of complications caused by 
an illegal implant allegedly made by Windslowe.

In another gruesome case in Miami, Florida, a transgendered woman, Oneal
Ron Morris, 30, was arrested after a patient complained the bogus doctor 
pumped tyre sealant into her buttocks.

Second case: 'Black Madam', also known as Padge-Victoria Windslowe, was 
about to host a 'pumping party' at a home in Philadelphia when she was 
apprehended, police said

Some 30 people across the U.S. have come forward with claims they were scammed by Morris.

One alleged victim Rajee Narinesingh, accused Morris of making her 'into a 
monster' after she received several procedures from her in 
2005.

Narinesingh, a transgendered woman, wanted fuller lips, cheeks and chin, but could not afford an operation by a licensed plastic surgeon and said she heard about the 'fake doctor' by word of mouth.

After being injected with a cocktail of toxins, she was allegedly left with lumps in her cheeks, a misshapen chin and upper lip. She later had to pay a real surgeon to repair the botched job.

Morris, who also used super glue on her patients' wounds, was charged with two felony counts of practising medicine without a license with serious injury.
