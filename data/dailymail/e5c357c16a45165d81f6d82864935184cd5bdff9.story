Jack Colback says Newcastle will again have to prove their resilience to recover from setbacks as they gear up for a week which will define their season.

The Magpies failed to show as they were beaten 4-1 at Arsenal at the weekend, just 24 hours after manager Alan Pardew collected the Manager of the Month prize for November.

But with a League quarter-final at Spurs on Wednesday followed by Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby, former Sunderland midfielder Colback says his new club can ill afford to dwell on the disappointment of the Emirates.

That result came just 24 hours after Alan Pardew collected the Manager of the Month prize for November 

‘It’s a massive week,’ said the 25-year-old, who takes on the Black Cats for the first time since his controversial move between the North-East rivals in the summer.

‘We have to forget about that performance. They out-played us and won all their battles, which was disappointing. We weren’t quite at it and were a bit off the pace. Maybe we didn’t show Arsenal enough respect.

‘But these are two massive games now. We’ve got to put things right. But we have shown character to bounce back all season, just look at the win we got against Chelsea (2-1).’

Wednesday’s game at White Hart Lane is Newcastle’s third away tie at top-flight opposition in the competition.

Crystal Palace and Manchester City have already been beaten and, with a place at Wembley just two rounds away, debate has been raging on Tyneside as to which is the more important game during this coming week.

Pardew has insisted that he will be going all out for victory in both, but admits his team need to improve upon their performance at the weekend to stand any chance of winning either.

‘We didn’t show our true quality at Arsenal – we’re better than that,’ he said.

‘But the character of this team is never lost. We need to stay at the levels we have set, like we did against Chelsea.

‘It’s a big week. It’s the third Premier League away tie we’ve had now, so we’ ve done it the hard way but hopefully we can do it again.’

Newcastle, meanwhile, are set to allow Hatem Ben Arfa to head out on loan for the remainder of his contract with Hull almost certain to terminate his season-long stay as early as next month.

The 27-year-old has failed to impress at the KC Stadium and manager Steve Bruce has lost patience with the former France international.
