The Jablonski name conjures impressive modeling associations like million-dollar beauty contracts, Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show features, and Giorgio Armani campaigns.

In the last four years Jacquelyn and Constance Jablonski, who are not related, have simultaneously built their status as supermodels with the same exact surname. Now, a third unrelated Jablonski has emerged onto the scene.

High school student Maggie Jablonski follows in the footsteps of Constance, 22, an Estée Lauder spokeswoman and Jacquelyn, also 22, Tommy Hilfiger's long-running face. Both are industry veterans who have walked in the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show—modeling’s highest distinction—a number of times.

Fresh face: Maggie Jablonski, pictured above in one of her agency Polaroids, is set to elevate the Jablonski name to the next level

Together, they’ve established the Jablonski name as modeling’s gilded moniker.

It’s a distinction that Maggie should find immensely helpful. Now in her first runway season, she has already walked for the likes of Marc Jacobs, Marni, and 3.1 Phillip Lim.

Hailing from Sioux City, Iowa, a place she says is ‘full of corn,’ Maggie is poised to elevate the lofty name to the next level.

While the Jablonski surname already offers inimitable beauty on tap, Maggie’s look is quite different, setting her apart from the other two.

Constance’s French-bred flaxen hair and doe-eyed appearance have earned her a coveted beauty contract, as well as campaign work with commercial European brands like Hermès and Moschino. Jacquelyn’s visibly American East Coast upbringing has paved the way for advertising contracts with classic labels including Burberry and J.Crew. Both have channeled their supermodel looks into a commercial goldmine.

By contrast, Maggie’s higher-minded aesthetic (brooding eyes, chestnut hair, and a slightly skewed nose—considered a positive quirk in modeling) is carving its own aesthetic niche within the Jablonski tribe. It has already inspired the likes of artistically-inclined designers Miuccia Prada and Marc Jacobs, both of whom have cast her in their shows.

When MailOnline spoke with Maggie, who stands at a lithe 5’ 10”, she had just spent the evening prior at Christian Dior’s atelier to run through looks with the label’s creative director Raf Simons.

‘He is so nice,’ Maggie said of Simons by phone, her voice laden with the excitement of a bewildered teenage girl. ‘It’s so cool when you meet people like that and it’s like, “What, they aren’t crazy? They are just normal people?”’

Maggie, politely declined to provide her age (her agent admits ‘she is a young girl’), likely in caution of rules outlined by the CFDA that requests designers not to use models under the age of sixteen.

'I want to sounds like I have a background in the industry’

She says that her education in fashion is a recent one: ‘That whole interest definitely started when I got into the industry,’ she said. ‘I had to have some sort of background knowledge about it because I don’t want to sound line an unintellectual about it, I want to sounds like I have a background in the industry.’

She says that people at home in Iowa ‘Don’t really understand the fashion world—if you aren’t in a Kohl’s catalogue, they don’t really get it.’

However, ‘They are kind of learning,’ she says. ‘When I did Prada resort this past summer they were like “Oh Prada, I’ve heard of that so it must be good, right?”’

Maggie, it seems, is quickly priming herself on her new, likely alien surroundings. The words ‘industry’ and ‘career’ carried throughout our entire conversation, making it evident that the very young student--who named math as her favorite subject-- is quickly learning adapt to a world where exceeding precociousness, particularly at her age, provides a competitive edge.

On the runway: Jablonski has already booked shows including Prada resort 2014 (L), and Marni spring 2014 (R)

For example, Maggie says that she holds Italian Vogue as an editorial goal over its American counterpart. ‘American Vogue has more turned into celebrities [always] being on the cover but Italian Vogue is staying strong with models on the cover,’ she announced with proud inflection.

Her road to early success began only last summer when she and her older sister briefly moved to New York to attempt modeling together. It’s there that Maggie learned how to pose, dress, and walk a runway. ‘I had a tough time,’ she said of her catwalk lessons. ‘I bought five different pairs of shoes to try, thinking it was the shoes [instead of me].’

‘American Vogue has more turned into 
celebrities [always] being on the cover but Italian Vogue is staying 
strong with models on the cover’

After ‘the critiques on how to move your arms, when to blink, it all came together,’ she says. ‘My dad pushed me more than anyone else…every night he would come into my room and say “you need to walk.”’

He was also her introduction to modeling’s other two Jablonski’s. Maggie recalls that after her father found Jacquelyn and Constance’s profiles on the widely-used site, Models.com (which serves as a Style.com-type resource for the modeling industry) he came to her and said ‘They have two other Jablonski’s you know.’

While Maggie has yet to meet Constance and Jacquelyn, both of whom now reserve their runway appearances for major (higher-paying) brands like Michael Kors and Dolce & Gabbana, she says that she ‘cannot wait for the day’ that they finally cross paths.

More Accolades: Maggie, who is now in Paris looking to book more big runway shows, was also cast in Marc by Marc Jacobs (L) and 3.1 Phillip Lim (R)

That milestone shouldn't too be far off. Following a one-year hiatus from modeling, Maggie returned to New York this past June with new Polaroid images that drew the attention of reputable casting agents around the city. ‘Within minutes of sending them out, we got major responses,’ her American agent, Domonick Hannosh at Major Models, told MailOnline.

Mere weeks later Maggie was cast as an ‘exclusive’ in the Prada resort 2014 show, a distinction that has launched the careers of many top models.

A few months later she was cast in the Phillip Lim, Marc by Marc Jacobs, MM6, and Marc Jacobs’s spring 2014 shows at New York Fashion Week. She followed that up by skipping the London shows and flying straight to Milan where she booked spots in Marni and MSGM’s line-ups. Maggie is now in Paris, her first visit to the city, in the hopes of booking major shows there as well.

'It’s so crazy to think that two other 
people have the same last name as me...especially since 
Jablonski is not that common of a last name’

‘Most people don’t get these kinds of opportunities, I get to see the world and get to go to Italy and Paris,’ she said. ‘Even New York is a big deal where I’m from.’

On the brink of what could be a lightening career, Maggie admits that many of her aspirations mirror those of her namesake colleagues. ‘I look up to them so much,’ she said of Constance and Jacquelyn.

Last week, she ‘was in Milan and I was walking by the Armani building and Jacquelyn was on a billboard. I was like “Oh my god that is Jacquelyn Jablonski!”

‘I feel like we have some sort of relation even though we don’t,’ she admitted. ‘It’s so crazy to think that two other people have the same last name as me in this industry, especially since Jablonski is not that common of a last name.’

But Maggie is the first one to assert: ‘I’m hoping to be the third successful one.’
