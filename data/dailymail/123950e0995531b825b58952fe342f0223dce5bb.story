Garry Monk feels referees are giving Swansea a raw deal because they see his side as a soft target.

Swansea have had Wilfried Bony and Angel Rangel sent off in their last two Barclays Premier League matches and manager Monk admits he has been left bemused by what he sees as refereeing inconsistencies in games involving his team this season.

Monk says he has studied every single Swansea game on tape and expressed his concerns at an hour-long meeting he had with officials at the Liberty Stadium this week - but insists he won't stop drumming a fair play philosophy into his players even if it hurts them on the pitch.

'I just feel at this moment in time it is far too easy to book a Swansea City player,' Monk said ahead of Newcastle's visit to south Wales on Saturday.

'I have analysed every single foul we have committed this season and every foul against us, and in terms of the consistency level it does not add up.

'We are getting punished for everything but some teams come here and they commit five or six fouls straight away.

'Their plan is to be physical and that is the whole game plan, and when we stand up for ourselves we get punished for it.

'I don't know why it is, we try to play good football while other teams think the best way to stop that is to be physical and get in our faces.

'Maybe we are too much of an easy target.'

Monk revealed current Premier League referee Chris Foy, former official Alan Wiley and John Walton, of the Referees' Association, visited Swansea this week to discuss refereeing issues and hear his concerns.

Ironically, Foy was in charge of Swansea's goalless draw at Sunderland last weekend when Rangel was sent off for two bookable offences, Monk being particularly unhappy with the nature of the second yellow card when he was adjudged to have obstructed Black Cats winger Will Buckley.

'If you look at Angel's second booking, what do you want him to do?' Monk asked.

'He cannot disappear, and in the lead up to his first one there was a foul against us that was not given.

'Those decisions go more against us than for us.'

Monk also said he was exasperated by Sunderland striker Connor Wickham constantly going to ground at the Stadium of Light and questioned why Foy kept awarding him free-kicks in such circumstances.

He promised that Swansea players would be fined if they did the same thing, saying winning that way would give him no satisfaction whatsoever.

'I talked to them about Wickham's performance at Sunderland,' Monk said of his meeting with the officials.

'He had the ball played up to him 13 times and on nine of those occasions he was on the floor. He is 6ft 3ins and about 14-15 stone, the same weight as Bony.

'But do Bony and Bafe (Gomis) go on the floor? No, because we promote for them to stay on the feet.

'I clocked what Wickham was doing straight away and I said to the linesman in front of me 'you watch the next time the ball gets played to him, he'll be on the floor.

'He did go to ground, so what does that tell you? That he is going to get the decision if he goes on the floor, and that is hard to take because you run the risk of yellow and red cards.

'But I have said to the players if we are going to win we will win properly because you will get more satisfaction out of it.

'That will be the way I want to do it, but I understand the players must feel the reward on Saturday.

'I don't believe in players going to ground if they have not been touched, if that were to happen I would deal with it afterwards.'

Monk said Foy told him West Ham manager Sam Allardyce spoke to the Referees' Association about the difference between perceived big clubs and small clubs.

'Referees have a tough job and I am sure it is not intentional, but at this moment in time we seem to get punished for everything,' Monk said.

'I am not saying we do not make fouls that are yellow cards, but overall it looks too easy to punish us.

'We showed them examples and they could see clearly what I was talking about.

'It is so unjust and the way we play means we need more protection.'Â
