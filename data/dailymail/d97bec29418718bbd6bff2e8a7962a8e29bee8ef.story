Rickie Lambert is so desperate to hit the ground running at Liverpool he returned to training two days early.

Not due back until later this week, the summer signing from Southampton took part in his first full session at the club's Melwood headquarters on Monday following a short break after England's World Cup exit.

The 32-year-old has been joined at Melwood by former Southampton team-mate Adam Lallana, while Jay Rodriguez is also on Brendan Rodgers' radar.

Rodriguez is not due to play again until October following surgery on a ruptured anterior cruciate but is admired by boss Rodgers, as are Swansea's Wilfried Bony and QPR striker Loic Remy.
