Tom Ince is giddy with excitement ahead of his imminent move to Inter Milan as the Blackpool winger looks primed to follow in his father's footsteps.

The 22-year-old is over in Italy tying up a deal with Walter Mazzarri's side, which should be completed in the next fortnight.

And when that is finalised - the player will move for around Â£155,000 in compensation - Ince can set about living the life he enjoyed as a child.

Move abroad: Paul Ince joined Inter Milan in 1995 and spent two seasons playing for the Italian giants

Dad Paul played at Inter for two years in the 1990s, with Ince Jnr rubbing shoulders with Javier Zanetti regularly.

'I'm not an Inter player yet,' Tom Ince said to Sky Italia. 'I'm very happy to be here two or three days in the meantime.

'Inter is a fantastic squad and Italy is a great country, where I have many fond memories.

'I remember the San Siro with affection, players like (Javier) Zanetti, (Massimo) Paganin and (Aron) Winter.

'We lived in Como. It's marvellous to be here at 22.'

Ince, who failed to make an impact on loan at Crystal Palace during the second half of the season, becomes a free agent this summer and is also a reported target.

'I'm young, English, a winger, a fun player to watch,' he said. 'Inter are changing, they have new young players and a new owner.

'(Inter president Erick) Thohir has told me that there are changes taking place, that he wants to return Inter to being big, to win in Italy and in Europe, to take them back to the level of great clubs on and off the pitch.

'This is fantastic for me.'

Making waves: Ince has been on loan at Crystal Palace from Blackpool since the January transfer window

Paul Ince is excited by the possibility of seeing his son wear the Nerazzurri jersey.

The former Manchester United star spent two seasons at Inter nearly two decades ago.

'This is an incredible story,' he said. 'It's incredible Tom is here at 22, he was five back then.

'I spent a beautiful time here. For me Inter is love, the fans transmit passion.

'The important thing for Tom is to be here today, to see the training ground, get to know the stadium and the city.

'Then we will go back home and take a decision. I'm here now for my son, I think we will know more in a couple of weeks.'
