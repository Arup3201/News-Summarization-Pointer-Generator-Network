Taiwan's aviation authority has suspended 29 TransAsia Airways pilots a week after one of their planes crashed into a river and killed at least 42 people.

10 of the airline's pilots were barred from flying after failed a proficiency test and 19 others are suspended until they take it.

They were among 49 pilots who were ordered to take an oral exam on handling emergency situations following the tragic crash in China on February 4.

Tragedy: 29 TransAsia pilots have been suspended for failing proficiency tests after one of their planes (pictured) crashed into the Keelung River in China last week

Fatal: At least 42 people died after Flight 235 clipped a bridge and smashed into the muddy river shortly after taking off from Taipei airport

Failure: The Civil Aviation Administration has said all pilots who failed the proficiency test in the wake of the February 4 tragedy will need to be retrained

Hope: Although 42 people tragically died aboard the plane, 15 of the 58 people on board were rescued and one person is still missing

The Civil Aviation Administration has said all pilots who failed the test will need to be retrained.

TransAsia Airways flight 235 crashed into the muddy Keelung River minutes after taking off from Taipei Songshan Airport.

One of its wings smashed into a bridge before the plane broke into several massive pieces and spread wreckage across the river. 

15 of the 58 people on board were rescued and one person is still missing.

A preliminary investigation indicated the plane's pilots shut off a running engine after its other engine died - a decision aviation experts have since said was an error.

TransAsia has said the pilots undergoing retraining have an average of almost 7,000 hours of flying time each. 

Overseas flight safety experts have now been contacted and the airline will begin more training on simulators next month, it added.

Deceased: Three bodies were recovered on February 7 (pictured) after the plane carrying 53 passengers and five crew crashed four days earlier

The airline says it has distributed 1.2million Taiwan dollars - around £25,000 - to cover funeral expenses for the families of the 12 Taiwanese victims and 13 from mainland China.

Another 51 people have received compensation of around 200,000 Taiwan dollars - or £4,100. 

The crash was the second fatal accident involving a TransAsia flight in less than a year and raised serious questions about the airline's corporate culture. 

Over the weekend, Taiwanese Premier Mao Chi-kuo said Taiwan needs to look at improving training in civil aviation once all the victims have been accounted for.
