A California couple renovated a home to look like the multicolored house seen in Disney's Up - and the neighbors aren't having it.

Hosam Haggog and Fatima Rahman spent over two years working on their 1891 Victorian Santa Clara home, NBC Bay Area reports, and say they did it for their daughters, ages 3 and 1-and-a-half.

'They love the movie "Up" and we just thought we'd give them something fun to be proud of and actually all the kids in the neighborhood really love the colors,' Haggog told the station.

'We're not trying to create controversy,' Rahman added. 'We're trying to build a home for our daughters and our family. And that's what our intention was.'

Neighbors told the station they were upset that the couple's home, located on the oldest street in the city and part of the Old Quad area, doesn't stick with a more traditional look like other Victorian homes - any of which are over 100 years old.

'I don't think it fits in,' neighbor Lou Faria, a member of the Old Quad Residents' Association, told the station.

'It 
really, in my opinion, is atrocious that this Victorian is a gracious 
old lady and it's being painted up to look like a clown.'

The couple faced a bumpy road after they placed a bid on their 1891 dream home in 2011, the San Jose Mercury News reported last year. The trouble began when the city's Historical Landmarks Commission, which is consulted on similar projects, became upset it wasn't contacted by the Santa Clara planning department, which approved the couple's renovation plans.

Over 100 people signed a petition asking why the commission had not been included, the paper says, before the situation became a full-blown controversy.

In June 2013, it adds that police had to remove a neighbor that was protesting at the couple's home. Not long after, Haggag spoke at a town meeting quoting the Koran.

'All we've been shown are vitriol, attacks, harassment, and yes, even threats of violence,' he said.

Chuck Petersen, another neighbor in the community, recently said he had a more moderate take on the unique home.

'I like historical houses to be historical,' he told NBC Bay Area. 'But on the other hand, it's his house and I feel that sometime down the line it's going to be repainted again anyway.'
