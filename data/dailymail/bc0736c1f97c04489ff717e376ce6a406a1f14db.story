Brazil star David Luiz doesn't seem too concerned by the pressures of playing the 2014 World Cup on home soil, if the behind the scenes footage from 'Brasil: A Nation Expects' is anything to go by.  

As Luiz Felipe Scolari's side prepare for the major tournament, several players sat down to talk about the expectations of a nation for the official film of the Brazil national team and Luiz looks to be in good spirits.

However, Luiz will be hoping his ball skills are slightly better in Brazil than in the short clip which sees the 27-year-old lose control of a ball in front of the camera and smash a Chandelier in the process.

The promotional clip features interviews 
with a host of Brazil stars as Willian, Neymar and Thiago Silva all sit 
down to discuss the forthcoming World Cup and the pressures that come 
with the tournament being play on home soil.

Chelsea midfielder Ramires reveals that playing for the Selecao always comes with a lot of pressure.

He said: 'There's always pressure. If you can't handle pressure it's best you don't play for Brazil.

Away from the Selecao, Luis looks set for a sensational £50million move from Chelsea to Ligue 1 champions PSG.

PSG
 representatives have flown out to Brazil in order to wrap up the deal 
which is likely to make Luiz the most expensive defender in the world.

Luiz struggled to nail down a first team place in Jose Mourinho's team last season and will surely be excited by the prospect of joining his Brazil team-mate Thiago Silva in France.

'Brasil: A Nation Expects will be available on Blu-ray and DVD from Amazon on June 2 2014.
