A businessman who stabbed his wife to death after she mocked the size of his manhood has been jailed for 14 years.

John Clinton's 24-year relationship with Paula, 48, broke down with her taunting him about his small manhood and wetting the bed after drinking, a court heard.

In a 'horrific' attack he stabbed more than 10 times in the eye, back and chest before she fled into the street, collapsed and died. He then slashed his own throat and wrists in an suicide attempt.

A court cleared him of murder and accepted his guilty plea to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after hearing he was suffering from a depressive illness.

After studying a psychiatric report, Judge Mark Brown told 51-year-old he could not rule that he was dangerous to the public.

But he told father-of-two Clinton he still bore 'a heavy responsibility' for the death of his wife.

'During
 the attack you prodded her in the breast and upper abdomen with a knife
 blade, stabbed her twice more to the eye and stabbed her eight times in
 the back,' he said.

'There were four penetrating stab wounds to the back, two of those penetrating into the right lung.

'This must have been an horrific ordeal for your wife and you let her die in the street outside.'

Liverpool Crown Court heard that the couple's marriage was breaking down when Clinton stabbed his wife at their home in Aintree, Merseyside, in November 2012.

Paula had wanted to leave him after he refused to quit drinking, and was on the phone to an independent financial advisor when they began arguing.

Just weeks earlier she had told friends during a holiday that she did not want to return to her husband.

Clinton put his hands over her mouth to stifle her screams, then grabbed a knife from the kitchen and stabbed her in the face and chest.

Armed police went into the marital home and found he had cut his throat and wrists in a serious suicide attempt. However, medics successfully treated him in hospital.

Clinton claimed during the row she had taunted him, as she had on earlier occasions, about his small manhood and his bed-wetting after drinking.

Judge Brown said Clinton was suffering from a depressive illness at the time and was self-medicating with alcohol.

Judge Mark Brown at Liverpool Crown Court told Clinton: 'This is on any view a sad and tragic case but there is no getting away from the fact you killed your wife in terrible circumstances'

'This is on any view a sad and tragic case but there is no getting away from the fact you killed your wife in terrible circumstances,' he added.

'Despite diminished responsibility you still bear a heavy responsibility for her death.

'Paula was 48 years old at the time of her death and it is likely she would have had many years of life ahead of her.

'You deprived her of those and deprived her family and friends of the love and affection she would have given them.

'It is particularly poignant that only a few weeks before the killing when she was on holiday with friends she told them that she didn't want to go home.'
