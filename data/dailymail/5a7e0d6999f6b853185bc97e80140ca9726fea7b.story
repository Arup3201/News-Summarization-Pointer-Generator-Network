Liverpool legend John Barnes believes Reds captain Steven Gerrard has been subject to unfair criticism following his side’s slow start to the 2014/15 Premier League campaign.

Gerrard was criticised for a lacklustre performance last weekend as Liverpool lost 3-1 against West Ham in a game that saw the midfielder lose possession on 14 different occasions while winning just 25 per cent of his tackles.

The 34-year-old has played every minute of Liverpool’s campaign so far, which has seen the Merseyside club lose three of their opening five Premier League games, but Barnes believes Gerrard can’t be the only player to shoulder the blame.

Speaking at the unveiling of Wembley’s new EE LED lighting system, Barnes told Sportsmail: ‘To say Gerrard is tired already is ridiculous.’

’You can’t just criticise him, the team as a whole haven’t been playing well.

‘Gerrard is the best in the Premier League in that deep-lying role and it’s just a matter of the team getting confidence back.’

The former Liverpool and England winger is also confident his old club can recover from their slow start, but doesn’t think Rodgers’ side will be challenging for the title this season.

Liverpool’s second-placed finish last term saw the Reds push Manchester City to the final day, but after three defeats in five games so far, Barnes believes a summer of changes will leave his old club battling for nothing more than a top four finish.

Barnes says he still won't rule out Liverpool winning the Premier League title despite their bad start

‘I make Chelsea favourites with City just behind them,’ Barnes added. ‘That’s not to say that Liverpool won’t get back to the form they were in last season, because they will.

‘It will just take time for the new players to get used to each other - there were a lot of changes of the summer, but I think Liverpool will still finish third or fourth.

After losing £75million striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona, Rodgers looked to replenish his squad with seven new faces including former City forward Mario Balotelli, who sealed a £16m deal from AC Milan.

Despite his bad-boy reputation, Barnes is confident Balotelli can become a star of the Kop, as long as the Italian ‘knuckles down’.

He added: ‘I expect Balotelli to knuckle down and become a top player for the club.

‘I know that he’s a great player and if there’s a club where he can do right both on and off the field then it’s Liverpool.

‘Rodgers won’t be like Roberto Mancini and try and fight him in training. He will be handled in the right way.

Rodgers will probably deal with Balotelli in a different way to how Roberto Mancini did...

Speaking underneath the updated Wembley arch, which will now see thousands of LED lights react to moments such as goals scored, crowd noise and social media sentiment, Barnes believes the new technology will help the atmosphere at the iconic stadium.

‘This new technology will make watching a football match become an even more interactive experience as the lights change when the crowd cheer.

‘I can’t so that I’d have noticed such a thing as a player as I’d be concentrating on scoring, but I’m sure it will attract more fans to Wembley.’ 

The superfast 4G and fibre broadband provider, EE, has installed the world's fastest interactive LED lighting system on the Wembley arch. The stadium is on course to become the world’s most connected stadium, thanks to the ground-breaking six year partnership deal with the telecommunications firm.
