A father-of-one has been killed during a police chase in Russia after driving through a roadworks barrier and falling down a hole in the road.

Fedor Drukov, 30, was killed instantly after his car plunged down the pit as he tried to flee from officers after they pulled him over.

Officers say Drukov had a 27-year-old wife called Natalya, adding that they couple had a four-year-old daughter Sasha together.

Fedor Drukov, 30, a married father-of-one, died instantly when he drove his car through a roadworks barrier and into a giant pit while fleeing from police

Officers say they tried to stop Drukov to check his papers, but instead of pulling over he sped off, causing a high speed chase which ultimately killed him

Police spokesman Dmitry Zuyev said: 'We are still investigating exactly why it was that he decided not to stop when he was flagged down.

'If he had simply presented his documents it could have been on his way but for some reason he chose to drive off.

'The police officers were however quickly on his tail, and a high-speed chase ensued ended when the car drove into roadworks.

'The man was from the local area but 
apparently didn't know that there were roadworks including a huge hole 
and he drove into the pit and was killed instantly.'

According to police Drukov was local, but was apparently unaware of the roadworks before driving into them

Forensic tests are expected to be carried out shortly to find out whether the man had been drinking or taking drugs.

The accident happened in the city of Blagoveshchensk, which is in south-eastern Russia.

A short clip of the incident, released by police, shows Drukov's car hurtling towards the roadworks late at night before disappearing down the hole.
