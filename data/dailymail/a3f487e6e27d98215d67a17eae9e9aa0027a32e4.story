A 28-year-old man had unprotected sex with a woman seven times without telling her he was HIV-positive, police have said.

Daniel Cleaves, from Henrico, Virginia, met the woman in a bar in downtown Bethesda, Maryland in July and had sex with her seven times over three days, according to court documents.

The woman only learned of Cleaves' HIV-positive status when she found medical tests in his backpack revealing his diagnosis. She then confronted him over text message. 

'Do you have HIV?' her text message read, MyFoxPhilly reported. He replied: 'No, why?'

When she said she knows he does, he responded: 'I should have told you... I am truly sorry, I am not a criminal. I am not a bad person. I just made a mistake.'

He added: 'It doesn't mean you have HIV though.'

The woman, who has not been identified, added that she was going to get tested for the virus before telling him he had committed a crime. 

'I know,' he texted her back. 'You can do what you want.'

The victim went to police on July 31. She told them that Cleaves never offered or asked to use a condom.

He was arrested last week and faces seven counts of knowingly having and attempting to transfer HIV to a victim in Montgomery County, Maryland.

Cleaves, pictured in a mug shot from Virginia, is still being investigated in three previous sexual assaults

Police will not reveal whether the woman did contract the virus due to medical record privacy laws. 

Investigators have searched his home and seized medical documents and medication, according to a search warrant.     

Cleaves has also been accused in separate sexual assaults in Richmond and Virginia Beach, although no charges have yet been brought in those counties, NBC12 reported.

His first alleged victim claims she met him in September 2013 while out in Richmond, where she blacked out several times after drinking.

She told police he took her to his home and raped her.

A second woman claims he sexually assaulted her at her home in Richmond after a night of drinking, NBC reported.

Then in March this year, a third woman met Cleaves on a dating website and he sexually assaulted her at a hotel in Virginia Beach, she claimed.

None of the victims indicated whether Cleaves had disclosed his HIV status, although one of the victims later read an internet post indicating that he had the virus, NBC12 reported.

The investigations remain active.

Cleaves posted bond and is awaiting his next court date. If convicted, he could face up to three years in prison on each count as well as a $2,500 fine, WTVR reported.
