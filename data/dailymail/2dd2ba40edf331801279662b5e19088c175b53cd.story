Wilfried Zaha's Manchester United career took another turn for the worse on Tuesday night as the £15million forward was an unused substitute as Louis van Gaal's side crashed out of the Capital One Cup with a humiliating 4-0 defeat against MK Dons.

The 21-year-old, who is still yet to start a Premier League for United since arriving from Crystal Palace in January 2013, was a noticeable inclusion on the bench at stadium:mk but failed to get any minutes on the pitch as Van Gaal opted for other alternatives.

Zaha wouldn't have made the greatest first impression on the new United boss earlier this summer as he opted not to turn up to an 'optional' training session on the third day of pre-season - attended by every other available squad member.

With first-team football hard to come by at Old Trafford, it appears Zaha's international career is being hindered as a result, with England Under 21 boss Gareth Southgate set to leave the winger out of the squad for theEuro 2015 qualifiers against Lithuania and Moldova.

Zaha, who earlier this week was sanctioned for speeding in his £188,000 Lamborghini Gallardo in Surrey, withdrew from the last U21 squad in May due to a minor injury.

And Southgate has insisted that attitude and application is key if players such as the United forward want to make it to the top.

He said earlier this week: 'The door will always be open for lads to work their way back in.

'But we want to be world champions and to get there it is going to take a certain mindset. We have a group of players who have that mindset.'

The likes of former side Crystal Palace, QPR and Newcastle have all been mooted as possible destinations for the wide-man to go out on loan as he looks to get his career back on track, with high-flying Championship side Nottingham Forest also linked with the former Cardiff loanee.
