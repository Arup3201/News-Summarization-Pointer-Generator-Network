A British comedy show chain called The Glee Club is taking on Twentieth Century Fox claiming the American company violated its copyright when naming the hit TV show, Glee.

Comic Enterprises Ltd, which has four clubs under its 1999 trademark, 'The Glee Club', is locked in a legal battle with Fox, the hugely popular musical show unlawfully 'swamped' its own trademark.

The club chain's boss, Mark Tughan, has also accused the massive Los Angeles-based outfit of 'threatening to take away his home' if he loses the enormously costly legal action.

Success: Glee is the top-rated television series on satellite TV, attracting millions of viewers, who were branded 'Gleeks'

Days after one of TV show's stars, Cory Monteith, died from a drug overdose, Fox has denied any trade mark infringement and called for Comic Enterprises' mark to be revoked at London's High Court.

Comic Enterprises registered 'The Glee Club' trademark, including an image with the words in a spotlight, on June 19, 1999, the company's barrister, Douglas Campbell said. 

It opened venues under that name in Birmingham, Cardiff, Oxford and Nottingham between 1994 and 2010, hosting top comedians such as Jack Dee, Michael McIntyre and Rob Brydon, selling 1.5 million tickets.

But Comic Enterprises is, by any measure, a relative minnow compared to Fox - one of entertainment's biggest fish.

Mr Tughan, Comic Enterprises' owner, 
says he was stunned when, flicking through TV channels in 2010, he 
discovered Glee, a show about an American High School Choir group, on 
E4.

'I thought 'Jesus Christ - there's a 
TV show with our name on it'. I warranted it to be serious enough to 
look into it and get to the bottom of what the hell was going on,' he 
told Judge Roger Wyand QC.

Mr Tughan, who thought the show had a
'saccharine, bland narrative', started to become especially worried 
when he realised the second season was a runaway success when it aired 
on Sky, later that year.

That season, by Fox's own account, 
Glee was the top-rated television series on satellite TV, attracting 
millions of viewers, who were branded 'Gleeks'.

Mr Tughan said his confused customers
have often assumed there is some connection between his comedy clubs 
and the TV show, causing major problems for his business.

Denial: Fox has denied any copyright infringement and called for Comic Enterprises' mark to be revoked at London's High Court

His barrister said that the company's
mark and that of Fox, used on much of its merchandising, share a 
'strong visual, aural and conceptual similarity' for services which are 
'in part identical' and otherwise 'extremely similar'.

He said: 'The acts of Twentieth 
Century Fox have swamped the reputation of Comic Enterprises' mark and 
thereby diluted its ability to denote its services.'

Comic Enterprises had hoped to keep 
the costs of the case down by having it heard in the patents county 
court but a judge moved it to the High Court at the studio's request in 
March.

Since then, Mr Tughan has accused 
Fox, which has set aside £750,000 to fight the case, of 'intimidating' 
him in what he brands a 'David and Goliath' tussle.

'Legal costs matter to this David,' 
Mr Douglas said, 'given the recent threats made against Mr Tughan 
personally - the suggestion being that, if Comic Enterprises lose, Fox 
will try to take away his home.'

But the studio denies any such threats, as well as the alleged trade mark infringement and passing off.

Simon Malynicz, for Fox, said the 
contentious marks are 'plainly different' and leave almost no scope for 
people to muddle the two.

He said: 'There is no evidence of genuine or properly substantiated confusion and no likelihood of confusion.

'A fleeting, momentary or speculative
thought about whether there might be a connection cannot be consistent 
with the requirement that there be damage to the essential function of 
the trademark.'

He put forward evidence from the 
show's co-creator, Ian Brennan, who said he picked the name for its 
'double-meaning' of slang for choir groups and 'sinister joy or 
shadenfreude'.

Mr Malynicz argued that Comic 
Enterprises' mark is descriptive and should be invalidated in relation 
to singing groups and revoked for all goods except for comedy clubs and 
live music venues.

The legal battle continues just as 
shocked fans of the TV show are coming to terms with the death by drink 
and heroin overdose of Canadian Monteith, who played Finn Hudson.
