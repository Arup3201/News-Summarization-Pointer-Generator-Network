Suspended in the atmosphere and bewitchingly bizarre, these are the incredible cloud formations that have been leaving gazers in a twist.

These fantastical formations of lenticular clouds - or Altocumulus lenticularis - look as though giant corkscrews have descended from the sky.

The strange - yet stunning - cloud patterns were caught on camera over Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State, U.S.

Fascinated: Amateur photographer Tyler Mode said he loves nothing better than taking his camera out on mountain hikes in the hope of capturing of the clouds

Amateur photographer and grocery 
assistant manager Tyler Mode - who snapped these incredible images - has
 become fascinated with the cloud formations, which are very common in 
the region.

He said he loves nothing better than taking his photography equipment out on mountain hikes in the hope of capturing the clouds on camera.

He said: 'The clouds are caused by high winds and upper level moisture coming over the mountain.

'They form quite often but are usually masked by other clouds, their name is lenticular because of their lens shape they have.

Bizarre and bewitching: The formations, which have become a common sight in the mountainous region, have enchanted many

Dramatic: Lenticular formations - or Altocumulus lenticularis - are stationary lens-shaped clouds

Explaining the unexplained: On occasion, the clouds have been offered as an explanation for some UFO sightings, due to their unusual shape

'I know they are a sign of an 
approaching storm system.Â  A number of people stopped to take pictures 
and claimed it was the start of a tornado but it was not.'

Named so due to their lens-shape, 
lenticular formations are stationary clouds usually formed by moist air rising in the 
high-altitude skies over a mountain or range of mountains.

The clouds are usually formed 
perpendicular to the direction of the airflow, and are usually avoided 
by aircraft pilots because of the turbulence associated with them.

On occasion, they have been offered as an explanation for some UFO sightings, due to their unusual shape.
