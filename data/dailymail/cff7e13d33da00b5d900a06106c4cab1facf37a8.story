A Kazakh woman left disfigured after undergoing radiation therapy for cancer in her jaw that she never had is undergoing reconstructive surgery at a Kentucky hospital Monday morning.

Lessya Kotelevskaya, 30, is receiving the $1 million surgery for free after a doctor at the University of Louisville Hospital heard about her plight and offered to help. It is expected to take up to 24 hours to complete.

Kotelevskaya was misdiagnosed with cancer in her jaw in 2001 and underwent intensive radiation therapy that left a gaping hole in her cheek and no jaw bone.

She was wheeled into surgery around 7:30 this morning. Her surgeon, Dr Jarrod A. Little, is working for free and will spend the next 24 hours in surgery with Kotelevskaya.

Her cousin Oleg Sennick, 43, who moved to the U.S. in 1996, discovered her struggling to survive in 2012 and brought her to the U.S. for treatment.

It was while he was working as a hairdresser that Sennik mentioned his cousin's situation to a client, who happened to be married to a doctor from the University of Louisville Hospital.

She mentioned the case to her husband, and he said his colleagues may be able to help.

'She has a terrible problem, I know how to fix it. The rest is immaterial,' Little told ABC.

Little will remove the dead tissue from Kotelevskaya's jaw, then take a piece of her leg bone and attach it, with skin and blood vessels attached, to the remnants of her jawbone and secure it using screws and a titanium plate.

Little says helping people like Kotelevskaya is what made him want to become a doctor.

'Plastic
 surgery is typically associated with cosmetic stuff, and this is the 
other part of plastics that took 11 years of training after college,' he
 told ABC. 'This makes it all worthwhile.'

Kotelevskaya has been so excited about the surgery that she hasn't been able to sleep, Sennik said.

'I just want to become a normal person 
so I don't have to concentrate on my face,' Kotelevskaya, who had been living at a car wash when she was rescued by her cousin, told the Sun Herald.

The mother of a
 seven-year-old boy, Erik, was 19 when she was told she had terminal 
cancer in her jaw. She had gone to her doctor after being elbowed in the
 face during a basketball game.

The aggressive radiation treatment 
she was given disfigured her face and made it difficult for her to eat, 
talk or live a normal life. Her cousin says she was also given an abortion without her knowledge or consent.

The 30-year-old can barely open her mouth and for nearly ten years believed she had a terminal disease. 

'She pulls food apart and jams it behind her teeth and it leaks out the other side,' Little told ABC.

'She has gotten really innovative dealing with it.'

For more than 10 years Lessya Kotelevskaya hid from society after aggressive cancer treatment left a gaping hole in her cheek.

Her
 husband left her after she became pregnant with her son, Erik, and 
she began living on the edge of society, sometimes without a roof over 
her head and taking on menial night jobs so that no one could see her 
face.

As well as damaging 
her face, the misdiagnosis ruined Ms Kotelevskaya's life. She was 
married and helped run her own clothing store at the time but, when the 
treatment left her unable to eat or speak properly her husband left in 
2007 and the store was forced to close.

Reunited: With her cousin's help, Kotelevskaya has begin making a new life in the U.S., where her son is in the first grade

'She couldn’t work, because everybody would look at her and say something’s wrong with her, and she’s going to die anyway,. She was totally rejected by society,' Oleg Sennik, her cousin, told the Courier-Journal. 

With no business or immediate family to rely on, Kotelevskaya began a life in the shadows of society. To avoid the unkind stares of strangers, the mother took night jobs such as cleaning gyms or carrying sand to 
people's doorways in winter. 

At one point, she was so hard up that Kotelevskaya, who has to hold a towel to her face when she eats to prevent food dribbling out the hole in her cheek, had to live in the utility room of a car wash.

When her cousin eventually traced her, she weighed just 79lb. Sennik took her for treatment in  Ukraine, where he had been raised, and it was there that she first realized her cancer diagnosis was wrong. 

The first 72 hours after the surgery will be critical, says Little, because of the risk of a blot clot, which would undo all the work.

Kotelevskaya will need to spend the next three weeks after the surgery in hospital recovering.

Little explained that it was possible for doctors to mistakenly identify benign tumors in the jawbone for cancer.

'If you're not accustomed to looking at them underneath the 
microscope, or you don't have specialized pathologists like we do here, 
they can be mistaken for malignant tumors,' he said.

To repair the damage suffered by Kotelevskaya, she had initial surgery on November 14. Today's operation is the final piece of the puzzle.

Little said the procedure was common practice for his medical team because Kentucky has some of the highest rates of head and neck cancer.

'She missed so many years of her life. She said that this is the first time she’s feeling like she doesn’t have to hide,' Sennik said.
