A benefits mother-of-11 infamous for taking her huge brood on foreign holidays has boasted about having £4,000 to splash on Christmas presents.

Cheryl Prudham has previously attracted controversy for insisting she's happy to claim state handouts and blaming the welfare system for her large family.

She has now revealed that her family's heavily-subsidised income has allowed her to stash away thousands for the festive season.

Cheryl Prudham, pictured with husband Rob and her family, says she has saved £4,000 from her benefits to spend on Christmas presents for her 11 children

The couple - who this summer took their children to Menorca on holiday - have recently had twin daughters

The 32-year-old, from Gravesend, Kent, says she has saved £350 for each of her youngsters which she plans to spend on lavish gifts.

She told Closer magazine: 'I love spoiling them at Christmas - and being on benefits means I can do that.

'I've bought four of then iPad minis, costing £250 each, and the twins will get gold bracelets with their names engraved on them.'

In her latest interview, Mrs Prudham also revealed that her benefits help her fund a £30-a-week smoking habit and have paid for the family to redecorate their new five-bedroom council house.

Her comments have provoked anger among campaigners, who say state handouts should not fund lavish lifestyles.

Andy Silvester, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's not for the state to say how many children anyone should have, but there is a limit to the number of children taxpayers can support.

'Couples up and down the country face tough decisions all the time when they decide if they can afford another child, and those on benefits should be no different.'

They were moved into a five-bedroom council house after complaining their three-bed home was cramped

Mrs Prudham's husband Rob earns £1,600-a-month as a delivery driver, but their large family means they still get more than £28,000-a-year in benefits and tax credits.

The mother-of-11 first attracted criticism for demanding her local council provide her with a bigger council house to give her growing brood more space.

The family were then photographed enjoying a two-week holiday in Menorca, which she insisted they 'deserved'.

Mrs Prudham had her first son George, 13, when she was just 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in Kent in the summer of 2000.

She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 12, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, eight.

She then had three unplanned pregnancies; Maisie, seven, Lillie, five, and Madison, four.

In March 2009, she met current husband Rob and they had Leon, now three. They then had Lenny, now two, before she gave birth to daughter Lainey in January last year.

She then had twins Lacey-May and Lexi-Rose this summer.

Describing the holiday, she said: 'I asked the school headmaster if we could get time off, but he said 'no'. So we decided to go anyway. One of the weeks was during half term, so they haven't missed that much school'

Speaking earlier this year, Mrs Prudham said: 'People criticise me for getting lots of benefits but it's the Government's fault. You're not going to say no to money if it's offered to you'
