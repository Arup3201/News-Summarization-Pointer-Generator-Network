Greeted by crowds of delighted flag-waving children, it was a bittersweet moment for the Duchess of Cornwall as she arrived at a school once attended by her late brother Mark Shand today.

The Duchess, who was there to unveil a memorial to the late conservationist, was left devastated by his untimely death in New York earlier this year.

Mr Shand had been due to return to Saint Ronan’s School in Hawkhurst, Kent, to talk about his work as a conservationist and tell the children about his elephant charity but died before  making the trip.

Cheers: The Duchess was greeted by cheering pupils as she arrived to unveil a memorial to her late brother

Looking around: The Duchess was given a tour of the school by headmaster, William Trelawny-Vernon

He had attended the £5,300 a term Kent prep school from the age of eight in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Mr Shand, who was 62, died after slipping and hitting his head on a pavement outside the Gramercy Park Hotel in Manhattan last April.

Along with the Prince of Wales, Camilla was left distraught by the loss of her brother and was pictured looking tearful in the days following his death and at the funeral.

Despite her grief at the loss of her brother, the Duchess was all smiles as she met current pupils and their headmaster, William Trelawny-Vernon.

Elegant in a pinstripe grey suit and black boots, accessorised with a matching pair of diamond lapel pins, the Duchess was every inch the royal style icon as she was shown around the school.

But glamorous though she looked, for Camilla, the real highlight of the visit was trip to the astro-turf pitch currently being built that will be named 'Shand-Ba' in memory of the late Mr Shand.

Many of Mr Shand's former classmates were in attendance as the Duchess toured the school, stopping in the dormitory once used by her brother and in the chapel where he used to pray.

His nephew Luke Irwin was also there and said that his uncle’s years at St Ronan’s were 'idyllic and the happiest of his scholastic life'.

He added: 'I miss him so much but I do know that nothing would have given him greater pleasure or a higher honour than having a pitch at St Ronan’s named after him. It will be a day the children will remember and we are very honoured.'

For her part, Camilla, who last night presented the Man Booker prize to Australia's Richard Flanagan, has often spoken of her love for her brother and even penned an article  in which she remembered their happy childhood and his love of animals.

'We were lucky children; we spent an idyllic childhood living in Sussex under the South Downs,' she wrote in the piece, which was published in the Times ahead of a London memorial service for Mr Shand.

'It was happily before the advent of political correctness and health and safety, to neither of which Mark in his later life ever conformed. 

'He metamorphosised from rather a bad-tempered, fat child into a golden boy, blessed with good looks, charm and a "devil may care" attitude to life.'

The Duchess also spoke of her determination to ensure Mr Shand's conservation work continues and said both she and the Prince of Wales would do their best to uphold his legacy.

'They say that elephants never forget,' she concluded. 'Tara [Mr Shand's elephant] never forgot him and neither will we…'

There, she was shown the vines, many of which were still bursting with grapes, and sampled some of the finished product.
