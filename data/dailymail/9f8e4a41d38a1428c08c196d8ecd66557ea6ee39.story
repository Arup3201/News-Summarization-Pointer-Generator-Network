Stuart Pearce is coming under increasing scrutiny at Nottingham Forest as it emerged that associates close to owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi sought counsel from players over the former England international’s management style.

Pressure is mounting on the Forest boss after a run of two wins in 19 matches that has seen the team slide to 11th in the table and get knocked out of both cup competitions.

Forest’s FA Cup exit to League One Rochdale last Saturday left Pearce fielding questions about his future, with the match against Sheffield Wednesday at the City Ground this weekend followed by the trip to fierce rivals Derby County seven days later gathering importance.

Senior figures at the club, including chief executive Paul Faulkner and advisor John McGovern, are understood to be pressing for managerial stability and patience, while fans remain firmly supportive of their legendary former left-back.

But the canvassing of opinion from Pearce’s squad suggests it is an issue Al-Hasawi is giving serious consideration. 

Unusually, McGovern watched training on Tuesday alongside head of finance Lalou Tifrit, officially named also as the owner’s representative, and Hassan Saif, known by many as Al-Hasawi’s eyes and ears. It is believed their presence was to gauge the mood.

Al-Hasawi has been abroad but will attend the match against Wednesday and plans to talk to Pearce about the slump in form. Serious questions are likely if Forest lose again.

Aided by £5.5million record-signing Britt Assombalonga and £1.5m Michail Antonio, Forest started the season superbly, winning seven and losing none of their first 10 matches to sit top of the Championship.

But there has been little to cheer since, with the team losing their last three games. On Monday night Emad Alqahtani, a friend of Al-Hasawi, sparked discussion on Twitter by translating an interview the Forest owner gave to Kuwaiti television.

Alqahtani, who has watched games from the City Ground directors’ box, wrote Al-Hasawi suggested a ‘change’ might be needed after the next two games but later clarified he meant in philosophy rather than management.

Al-Hasawi has sacked three managers, Sean O’Driscoll, Alex McLeish and Billy Davies, since taking over in July 2012. He is aware of the good feeling Pearce breeds though and Andy Reid this week said players must 'look within themselves’ about performances.

Forest are looking to strengthen their squad this window, despite a transfer embargo limiting spend to £600,000 on the wages of loan players or free transfers. Right-back Todd Kane is set to arrive on loan from Chelsea.
