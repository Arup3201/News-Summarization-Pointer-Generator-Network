Tensions between Russia and Japan have intensified after two Russian warplanes were allegedly spotted flying over Japanese territory.

Japan scrambled its own fighter jets in response, claiming the Russian Su-37 planes had entered its air space off the northern tip of Hokkaido island in the South China Sea.

Russia denied any border violation, but Japanese Defense Minister 
Itsunori Onodera said that Tokyo will deal with yesterday's incident 'strictly, within the bounds of international law.' Japan released a picture of one of the Russian jets it claims made the incursion.

Tension: Some fear Russia, under president Vladimir Putin (left) may be trying to test Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe (right), who has a reputation as a staunch nationalist

Rally: Silent prayers were offered during a national meeting in Tokyo - attended by Mr Abe - to demand the return of what Japan calls the Northern Territories, seized by Russia in the closing days of WWII

Disputed: The remote Kuril Islands are at the centre of a battle between Russi and Japan

Mr Onodera accused the Russian fighter jets of 
intruding into Japanese air space, heightening regional tensions as 
Beijing denied Tokyo's claims that Chinese naval vessels had locked 
their weapons-targeting radar on to a Japanese destroyer last month.

The alleged intrusion, which lasted just over a minute, happened when Japan was observing 'Northern Territories Day,' when it holds annual rallies urging Russia to return a series of islands off eastern Hokkaido captured at the end of World War II.

The islands, called the Southern Kurils in Russia, are 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of where the incident took place.

In Beijing meanwhile, China's Defense Ministry issued a statement denying Japanese claims that Chinese naval vessels had locked their radar on to a Japanese destroyer and helicopter in two instances last month in the East China Sea.

Calls: Mr Abe delivers his speech during the annual rally which calls for the return of all four Russian-held islands North of Hokkaido in northern Japan, in Tokyo

Support: Some 2,000 people inclucing former residents of the Northern Territories attended the meeting

The countries are embroiled in a territorial spat over a cluster over tiny, uninhabited islands - called Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese - in the vicinity that are controlled by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan.

'The Japanese so-called claims that the Chinese navy locked on to Japanese ships and aircraft with fire control radar are not factual,' the Chinese statement said. It also accused Japan of repeatedly fabricating reports to smear China over the normal training actions of its military and building China up into an international threat.

'The Chinese side wishes that the Japanese side take practical actions, cease creating a tense atmosphere in the East China Sea, and refrain from issuing irresponsible statements,' it said.

Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida rejected Beijing's denial as 'completely unacceptable.' He told reporters that a thorough review of data by the Defense Ministry confirmed that the Chinese naval ship had locked on with its weapons targeting radar.

The US Navy has said that Chinese 
ships have in the past switched on their fire control radar as a 
response to being hailed by US ships. Experts say this underlines the 
need for better communication and coordination between navies.

The
 verbal back-and-forth comes amid the rise of China and to a lesser 
extent Russia's re-emergence as a major power in Asia - but it does not 
point to an imminent military conflict, said Narushige Michishita, a 
security expert at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in
 Tokyo.

'That's been 
encouraging them to be more assertive and more active both on the 
diplomatic front and military front in this region,' he said.

China
 and Russia may also be trying to test Japan's new prime minister, 
Shinzo Abe, who has a reputation as a staunch nationalist and came to 
office late last year pledging to defend Japan's sovereignty and to get 
tough with its neighbours in territorial disputes.

'In the short run, this is happening I think partly in reaction to Mr Abe's return to office,' Mr Michishita said.

While
 a conflict between Japan and Russia is much less likely than with 
China, Russia's alleged flight intrusion may be trying to send a signal 
to Tokyo not to take them lightly, he said.

That the incident took place on a day when Japan was demanding the return of Russian-controlled islands seems intentional, he added.

Russian 'military operations and diplomatic intentions are pretty well coordinated,' he said. Photos of the Russian jets provided by Japan's military indicate that Japanese fighters got relatively close.

When a Japanese fighter aircraft scrambles towards foreign aircraft, it usually maintains a 2,000 feet distance to avoid possible collisions, Mr Michishita said.

Collisions can happen. In 2001, a Chinese fighter collided with a US Navy EP-3 flying about 60 miles from the southern Chinese island of Hainan.

The Chinese jet crashed, killing the pilot, and the US plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Hainan, where the 24 crew members were detained and interrogated by Chinese authorities.
