Even having written last week that I thought this could be a tournament too far for an ageing Spanish team to win, I wouldn’t have predicted in a month of Sundays the absolute thrashing they received at the hands of Holland.

It was an absolute beating, revenge for the 2010 final, and an outcome that nobody in their mind would have forecast, even at half-time.

Robin van Persie’s goal just before the break was absolutely critical to changing the nature of the match.

That would have made a world of difference to the atmosphere in the Dutch dressing room, and laid the foundations for the second-half demolition.

Most strikers are confidence players who like to know they’re loved, and function better when they’re assured of that.

This is much more the case than with defenders or midfielders because it’s the forwards who tend to score most and bask in the adulation that brings. They get used to that. They need it.

Looking back to last season at Manchester United, I feel now that there were times when possibly RVP didn’t feel loved by David Moyes.

It’s entirely feasible RVP felt Moyes had a closer bond with Wayne Rooney, and that he, RVP, wasn’t on a par.

Management must be a minefield at times, but perhaps Moyes should have spread the love around a bit more evenly.

Forwards can be egotistical, needing not just praise when they do well but an arm around the shoulder, a metaphorical back-rub, another pat on the back, the works.

They’re a delicate breed than can require some pampering! And RVP is no different in that respect.

You only had to watch his performance, in the second half at least, to see his confidence grow after that astonishing header for 1-1.

That’s one of those goals that will look better and better as the years go by.

I’ve watched it a dozen times already and it’s simply magnificent.

Rene Meulensteen used to say that RVP’s left foot was like Roger Federer’s backhand; so extraordinarily brilliant that it looks effortless.

He’s the complete technician. And believe me, there was technique, too, in the execution of that header, getting on it the right way, at the right time, controlling it.

RVP had looked isolated before that; and then wonderfully on top of his game afterwards. It was agame-changer.

Take away that goal and the half-time talk for Louis van Gaal would have been an exercise in attempting to reassure his players, telling them to have patience with the game-plan.

The goal meant, instead, they were already assured, the place buzzing, the team ready to go out and capitalise.

As Arjen Robben moved up through the gears and attacked through the middle, Spain’s central defenders, Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique, faltered.

It’s absolutely crucial as part of that partnership to play as a pair, know exactly where the other person is, and what you’re both doing.

And from the start of the second half they looked like strangers and were opened up.

You have to wonder now whether they will even get out of their group. Their next match against an exciting Chile side is no gimme.

Still, what an unbelievable advert for the World Cup the Dutch provided.
