Honeytrap: Mundill Mahil was jailed for six years for causing grievous bodily harm

A medical student was yesterday found guilty of her part in a plot that left a besotted admirer dead.

The man, who she claimed had attempted to rape her, was lured to her home then beaten unconscious before being left to die in a burning car.

Mundill Mahil, 20, decided to ‘play God’ when she recruited two men to carry out the fatal attack on Gagandip Singh, who she claimed had attacked her six months earlier.

The virgin told Mr Singh she wanted 'closure' and even reassured the wary businessman following a text from him asking: 'Are we going to talk civil or do you want me dead?'

After inviting her victim to her student home, he was kicked, punched and struck with a camera tripod, then put into the boot of his car.

The vehicle was then driven to a quiet London side street and set alight. The post-mortem examination revealed Mr Singh was still alive when the fire began.

Yesterday, Mahil was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm for her role in the attack, and was warned by the judge it is ‘virtually inevitable’ that she will be given a long jail sentence.

Her two conspirators were also convicted of murder and manslaughter respectively. As the verdicts were read out, a woman had to be removed from court screaming uncontrollably.

Mahill and her victim were two young people with much in common – both devoutly religious, fiercely intelligent, and from solidly respectable Sikh families who wanted the very best for their children.

Had events unfolded differently, Mr Singh, a 21-year-old entrepreneur who founded a global television station dedicated to the Sikh community, could have had a stellar business career. Mahil would by now have been more than halfway through her studies to become a doctor, well on her way to accomplishing her dream of saving lives.

Tragically none of that is possible now. Instead Mahil, who used to work with disabled children, will soon be imprisoned.

In a trial at the Old Bailey lasting more than two months, jurors were told it was a revenge killing in retaliation for his attempted rape of Mahil the year before. That attack was never reported to police so what really happened between them will never be known.

What is known is that she lured Gagandip – Gagan to his family – to his death in February last year by sending him a text saying she wanted to talk to him.

So oblivious was he to her true motives that when he arrived at the home she shared in Brighton with five fellow medical students, Mr Singh was carrying a teddy bear and flowers as gifts for her.

After inviting him in, she led him to her bedroom, where two male friends were lying in wait. One, Harvinder Shoker, 20, was a fellow Sikh who knew Mr Singh but was infatuated with Mahil. The other was Shoker’s school friend, Darren Peters, 20. As Mahil ate Key Lime Pie in the kitchen, the two thugs mercilessly beat Mr Singh unconscious, then wrapped him in her duvet and placed him in the boot of his car.

They then drove to Blackheath, south London, doused the Mercedes – and the victim – in petrol, and set it alight. Within days Mahil and her co-conspirators had been arrested and charged with murder.

In court, Mahil claimed she hadn’t asked Shoker, who was convicted of murder, and Peters, found guilty of manslaughter, to kill Gagan but just give him ‘a couple of slaps’ to help him ‘mend his ways’.

But speaking outside court yesterday, DCI Damian Allain, of Scotland Yard’s homicide and serious crime command, said: ‘Her actions were calculating and she was at the heart of a criminal conspiracy of tricking Gagandip to Brighton to seriously assault him, which ultimately resulted in his death.

‘All this from a medical student, embarking on a career in the caring profession. I have no doubt that but for her actions, her deceit and trickery that night, Gagandip’s death would not have happened.’

Mahil and Mr Singh met at a Sikh festival in Wolverhampton in 2009 and the businessman was soon besotted with the pretty young student, although no romance developed.

But after his father was murdered while attending a wedding in the Punjab, India, the pair became closer.

Mahil, an undergraduate at Brighton and Sussex Medical School spent hours, often long into the night, comforting him on the phone and chatting online.

Then, one evening in August 2010, Gagan spent the night with Mahil at her student digs.

Both he and she were to refer to what happened between them that evening as attempted rape although, because of their strict moral and religious code, whether it was rape in the usual sense of the word is unclear.

Whatever happened between them, Mahil felt profoundly betrayed afterwards and the friendship quickly soured.

She turned for solace to Shoker, a trainee electrician who she had met through a martial arts course while still at school.

‘Our theory is that he was jealous of the close bond between Gagan and Mahil and wanted to win her affections,’ said a police source.

‘He was willing to do anything for her, even if it meant killing his old friend.’ Mahil, meanwhile, was speaking to her housemates about securing ‘justice’ by exacting revenge on Mr Singh and about her ‘gangster friends’.

She turned to Shoker for help and he roped in his friend Peters, a bicycle mechanic.

In his closing speech, prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC told jurors: ‘For a group of youngsters to decide that they are the custodians of Sikh virtue and play God on the subject of religious duty and moral obligation is a grotesque turn of events.’

Last night Mr Singh’s sister Amandip said she and her mother Tajinder were unhappy with the verdict.

She said: ‘We all feel that all of them were 100 per cent responsible for Gagan’s death. It was enormously hurtful to hear what Mundill said about my brother but I never believed it and to be honest anyone who knows him knows the truth.’

His mother Tajinder Kaur said: ‘When I first learnt of Gagandip’s death I was completely and utterly broken. I could barely function on a day-to-day basis and stumbled through each day not really knowing what was going on.

‘Since Gagandip’s death I feel like my heart is completely broken and taken away from me is my son and a source of joy in my day.’

Mahil, of Chatham, Kent, Shoker, of Greenwich, and Peters, of Blackheath, will be sentenced on Wednesday.
