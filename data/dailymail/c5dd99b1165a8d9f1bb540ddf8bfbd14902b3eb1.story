As one of London's most popular department stores, Selfridges is always packed with excitable shoppers looking to snap up a great purchase.

But now if the hustle and bustle of the central London shopping haunt gets too much for you, help is at hand.

Selfridges are set to launch a silent shopping area early next year to take the stress out of the January sales shopping experience.

Dubbed 'No Noise', the tranquil area is inspired by founder Harry Gordon Selfridge who had the idea way back in 1909.

The store's Ultralounge will invite shoppers to leave their shoes and mobile phones at the door and completely relax in silent bliss.

According to Selfridges creative director Alannah Weston, the room 'invites customers to find a moment of peace in a world where we are bombarded by a cacophony of information and stimulation.' WWD reports.

The space will include meditation sessions and headspace pods as well as a Quiet Shop, which will sell un-branded products to promote considered shopping.

Shoppers will also have the chance to purchase edits of pieces from spring ready-to-wear collections from clothing labels like Acne, Maison Martin Margiela and Jil Sander.
