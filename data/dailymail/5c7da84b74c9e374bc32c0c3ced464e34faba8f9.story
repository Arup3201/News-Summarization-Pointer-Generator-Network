Northern voters have deserted the Tories because David Cameron reminds them of everything they hate about the party, a damning new analysis reveals.

While voters in the north are just as likely to support policies on welfare, tax and law and order, the toxic Tory ‘brand’ means they refuse to back them at elections.

Mr Cameron is urged to promote more northern MPs with regional accents on to his front bench to counter the entrenched view that he cares more about the rich than ordinary people.

Mind the gap: Voters in the north are more likely to take a dim view of the Tories by a margin of up to 10 per cent

New polling shows voters in the north are significantly more likely to think Mr Cameron is out of touch, has no clear principles and is doing badly as Prime Minister than those in the south.

In 2010 only 31 per cent of voters in the north backed the Conservatives, compared to 43 per cent in the rest of England.

By comparison, when Winston Churchill was Tory leader in 1951 the gap was only three points.

Some 42 per cent of voters think Mr Cameron is out of touch, compared to just 32 per cent in the south.

Asked if Mr Cameron 'has no clear principles', 47 per cent of people in the north agreed, much higher than the 39 per cent in the south.

Headache: David Cameron is under pressure to win back support from northern voters

And 45 per cent of southern voters thought he was 'doing well as Prime Minister', but only 36 per cent of northerners agreed.

YouGov Pollster Peter Kellner said the Tories’ problems did not start with Mr Cameron, but neither have they lessened under his leadership.

‘Rather, he reminds many northerners just why they dislike the Tory Party,’ he warned in an article for Prospect magazine.

He found that ‘over the decades, the north has drifted away from the rest of the country.’

Last week's government reshuffle was in part designed to counter the impression of the Tory party being too southern.

Dubbed the 'flat cap reshuffle' a number of northern MPs were given more high profile ministerial jobs.

They included Liverpudlian former TV presenter Esther McVey becoming employment minister and Sajid Javid, who was born in Rochdale, who was promoted from a junior Treasury post to the rank of Financial Secretary.

The collapse of heavy industry in the 
north, more closely associate with the Labour party, has not led to a 
rise in popularity for the Tories – in fact the opposite has happened.

Mr Kellner found that standards of 
living are ‘actually much the same’ in the north and south, with pay 
rates outside London largely in line.

Unemployment in the north stands at nine per cent compared to six per cent in the south.

But in the West Midlands it is even higher at 10 per cent, and the Tories won 43 per cent of the vote there in 2010.

There is also ‘no material difference’
between how voters feel about their living standards or where they view
themselves on the political spectrum from ‘very right wing’ to ‘very 
left wing’.

On the role of the government, public services, the railways and welfare, there is almost no difference in views.

Mr Kellner said: ‘This simply sharpens
the question - if the obvious reasons for Conservative unpopularity in 
the north do not really hold up, what does explain why they are so 
disliked?

‘Northerners 
dislike David Cameron. They are significantly more likely to say he is 
out of touch and lacks clear principles, and much less likely to say he 
is doing well as Prime Minister.

‘And
despite the comparable living standards and levels of optimism, 
northerners are much more likely to think the coalition “is bad for 
people like you”.’

Broad agreement: The views on key issues and polices vary far less between north and south

While most people across the country think the Tories care more about the rich, ‘the sentiment is especially intense in the north’.

And there appears to be no easy solution to the problem. Mr Kellner added: ‘In the end, the Tories’ problem is not what they do; it’s what they are. Their trouble is their brand.’

The Tories are increasingly seen as a party of the south, and are urged to promote more people with regional accents on to the frontbench.

Mr Kellner concluded: ‘On its own, this won’t suddenly make the Tories popular on Merseyside or Tyneside; but as part of a long-term strategy to revive the Tory brand north of the Wash, it would be a start.’
