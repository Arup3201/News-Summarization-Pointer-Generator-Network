Sam Torrance caused one or two raised eyebrows when he urged Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley to end any uncertainty regarding Lee Westwood’s place in the team by picking him straight away.

Not least from the man who made Torrance vice-captain. ‘Yeah, I saw that,’ said McGinley, chuckling to himself. ‘That might be Sam’s view but it’s certainly not mine.’

Torrance was on safer ground when he mentioned Graeme McDowell for similar treatment, while Ian Poulter, if necessary, will definitely get one of the three wild cards as well.

Big call: Paul McGinley is not afraid to
leave out Lee Westwood for Ryder Cup

But Westwood, whose struggles continued with a missed cut at the Scottish Open, is one of a host of players McGinley will be keeping a close eye on as thoughts turn to the 143rd Open Championship at Royal Liverpool next week.

McGinley said: ‘We all know Lee has the pedigree. If you look back at the Ryder Cup since 1997, he has been the one constant pillar of all our success during that time. I’m a huge fan, and I’m certainly not looking to rip up the template. But I have to justify every decision I make, so he has to show me some form.

‘I spoke with Chubby (Chandler, Westwood’s manager) last week and spelled it out. We’ve got three huge events coming up that will determine the final line-up and the truth is Lee needs to do something.’

Poulter and McDowell are in a different category. ‘They’ve got the pedigree and they’re in good form,’ argued the Irishman. Poults is one place outside the team and G-Mac’s just won the French Open. So I’m not going to try to kid anybody. If either of them end up needing a pick, they’ve got a very good chance of getting one.’

It never does any harm to have one or two current major winners in the team and McGinley is confident a European can pull off an Open victory on the Wirral.

He said: ‘I’m very interested to see how they get on, because I think our chances of coming up with a winner have gone up considerably with so many of our top guys  competing in the Scottish Open.

‘I could never understand why you would come straight from  Florida to play links golf. Take  tennis. Would Federer or Murray go straight from playing on clay to Wimbledon without a warm-up event on grass?

‘I’m a big fan of seeing a major like a big exam, and you have to  prepare. Going from Florida golf to links golf, to me, is like studying English for a maths exam. So let’s see how they fare at Hoylake.’

Before competing in the Scottish Open, McGinley was at St Andrews last week overseeing a junior camp run by one of his sponsors, Allianz. His passion for the project was obvious. During a clinic he talked about his own career, in which he contributed fully to three Ryder Cup victories.

‘I’ve been a pro for 22 years and I would do things a lot differently if I had my time again,’ he told the audience.

Focused: Europe captain McGinley will be keeping a close eye on a host of players

He held up a golf club and likened it to a tree. ‘If you think climbing that tree is like getting to the top in golf, the idea should be to get there as quickly as possible,’ he explained. ‘But there are so many distractions which I regard as branches, like schedule and swing thoughts, and I ended up going sideways along too many branches.

‘I would hold up Colin Montgomerie as the perfect role model in this regard. He didn’t worry about swing changes, or getting too fit. He just concentrated on what would get him to the top.’

McGinley has watched the recent victories for Europe’s heavy hitters with mixed feelings.

‘Don’t get me wrong, it was great to see wins for Martin Kaymer, Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose and G-Mac, and the team is shaping up really nicely,’ he said. ‘But it was like this in 2012, when you couldn’t pick up a paper on a Sunday night without reading about yet another European victory.

‘And what happened when we got to Medinah? We got outplayed for most of the contest and got lucky when Poults changed the outcome almost single-handedly with his performance on Saturday night when he birdied the last  five holes.

‘I’m a great lover of boxing and we were on the ropes in the 11th round when we lashed out and caught our opponent,’ said McGinley. ‘If Poults hadn’t done what he did on the Saturday we’d have probably lost by about four or five points.

In the doldrums: Lee Westwood missed the cut at the Scottish Open  in Aberdeen

Good form: England's Ian Poulter will be one of the captain's picks if required

‘So I’m using that as a real motivating factor. We’ve won the last two Ryder Cups but how many  sessions have we actually won? (The answer is two out of nine). So the American luck has to change. I just hope it’s not on my watch.’Whenever talk turns to The Open right now, McDowell’s name invariably crops up.

He was the first-round leader at Hoylake last time and is heading to a course that plays to his strengths with his recent Paris win under his belt.

‘If you look back at G-Mac’s record, he invariably follows one victory with another soon after, and Hoylake looks perfect for him,’ said McGinley. ‘But I’m reluctant to  single out Europeans who I think will do well. Few players react well when they’re under that kind of pressure and I don’t want to heap any on his shoulders.’

Three big events to go and McGinley reckons Victor Dubuisson, Jamie Donaldson, Henrik Stenson, Sergio Garcia, McIlroy and Kaymer are booted and suited. Rose, McDowell and Poulter are all  guaranteed places, one way or the other. So that leaves three places up for grabs. Could the stakes be any higher, therefore, heading to Royal Liverpool?

Not only a Claret Jug to play for but a Ryder Cup place as well. One thing’s for sure: McGinley will be watching.
