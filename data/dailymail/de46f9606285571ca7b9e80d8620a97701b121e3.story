Manchester United have desperately needed a leader this season, but Rio Ferdinand didn’t even bother applying for the job. It would have been the perfect way for Ferdinand to repay the club after they stood by him during his drug test ban all those years ago.

After messing Roy Hodgson about last year, and turning his back on England, I expected Ferdinand to become a regular and a leader for Manchester United.

Instead he’s tweeting about toilet smells and Celebrity Big Brother.

Sir Alex Ferguson speaks very highly of Rio, describing his ‘unquestionable class’ in his autobiography last year. He also highlighted the extent of Rio’s focus away from football – scoffing at plans to go to the USA to meet rapper P Diddy: ‘Is he going to make you a better centre half?’ Fergie asked.

There’s nothing wrong with players having interests outside football, unless of course they take your focus away from the game. Fergie felt so concerned he instructed Rio’s agent to run all of the centre half’s activities away from football by him first.

Here’s the truth about Rio Ferdinand’s career: he’s been brilliant for Manchester United. His partnership with Nemanja Vidic has been rock solid in a period of United domination. Arguably the best centre half pairing in Premier League history.

For England he’s been one of many who failed to live up to expectation, which is disappointing.

If you’re thinking he’s past it, think again. Rio played a lot of games last year – over 30 – and was so good he made the PFA team of the year. He also earned a new contract extension from David Moyes. Sir Alex described it as Rio’s best ever season for United.

He’s now averaging one game a month for his club, sometimes watching the whole game from the subs’ bench. Rio’s out with a knee injury right now, but without wishing to be disrespectful, nobody is missing him.

I can’t help thinking that even though injuries might make things hard for Rio, he should be the leader on and off the field during these difficult times for Manchester United. Last season proved he’s still got the ability and the fitness, but his major contribution off the field this season has been to question Moyes’ way of telling the players who’s in the team. Not helpful.

Rio won’t like this but in terms of leadership, playing through the pain and proving people wrong, he could learn a huge lesson from John Terry on the pitch.

The Chelsea captain has been magnificent, playing every minute of every game in the Premier League so far this season, when many thought he was finished. I can’t help thinking Rio has underachieved – we should be talking about him as a leader, a captain, a rock. He should be out there setting the example for others. But it seems he has failed to convince Moyes of his value.

When he’s on Twitter asking inane questions about wee and poo I’m not surprised. It’s harmless ‘fun’ I suppose. Sadly it all contributes to the probability that Rio will be remembered most for an eight month ban, rather than being a Manchester United legend.

When Rio Ferdinand was coming through the youth system at West Ham United Harry Redknapp confidently predicted: ‘He’ll be the best defender in Europe one day.’ I don’t think that prediction quite came true.

And this season, Rio Ferdinand seems to be letting a golden opportunity to prove any doubters wrong pass him by. Shame.

Having recently seen a Premier League game at Newcastle United you can’t help but be impressed by the stadium, the fans and the aura around this huge club.

They’ve tasted Champions League drama, and FA Cup finals in recent memory. But the only thing missing on Tyneside is a sustained period of real success, and trophies of course.

And that’s why Yohan Cabaye is so keen to leave. In simple terms, he is way too good for Newcastle United.

I feel for the Newcastle fans.

Big loss: Yohan Cabaye looks set to swap Newcastle for PSG this month

Waving goodbye: Alan Pardew has shown disregard for cup competitions this season

I said last week in this column that Alan Pardew’s disregard for cup competitions would mean top players have no reason to stay.

If any Liverpool fan has to pay £93 
to get into the Emirates to watch their team’s FA Cup fifth round tie 
next month then Arsenal should be disqualified from the competition.

It really is that simple.

I can’t help thinking Cabaye’s stay at Newcastle has been a missed opportunity. He’s the kind of player you can build a top four team around, a cup winning team around.

Pardew failed to do that, and Mike Ashley didn’t offer the right investment to build a successful team.

Newcastle United fans have been lucky to have Cabaye – they will miss him, and so will the Premier League.

What a chance missed by everyone in charge at St James’ Park.

Jose Mourinho is going to look like a fool if Chelsea win nothing this season.

By selling Juan Mata to Manchester United Mourinho has sent out a clear statement that he can be successful without such a talented player.

At their best last season, Mata, Oscar and Hazard were a joy to watch. Mourinho felt the need to break it up and dispense with Mata.

This is the Juan: David Moyes poses with new Manchester United signing Juan Mata

This guy has been a match winner, a man for the big occasion, a man who could create and score, a player you would happily pay money to see.

But apparently he’s not good enough for what Mourinho wants.

It’s no surprise: Mourinho is a winner, and he finds a way to achieve success. It’s not as pretty as Barcelona’s method of lifting trophies, but he is a consistent champion doing it his way.

There are not many managers around who would feel comfortable leaving a player of Mata’s quality out of the starting line-up. Mourinho didn’t just leave him out of the Chelsea XI, he sold him to Manchester United.

I still think Chelsea will win the title, but if they end up with no trophies this season, everyone will have the right to point the finger at Mourinho and accuse him of making a huge blunder selling Mata.

Bringing pressure on himself: Jose Mourinho will be the one to blame if Chelsea fail to win anything this season

On top of that he will also stand accused of lacking the creative coaching knowledge needed to get the best out of such a talent.

You have to admire Mourinho for heaping that pressure on himself.

If you have concerns about the future of the society we live in then you should want Twitter to show more willingness to clean up its act.

I’m not talking about people bantering about football or debating the game. I’m talking about the disgusting responses to some of those debates.

It seems to be acceptable that a whole new generation is growing up thinking mild or vile abuse posted online to people they’ve never met is acceptable.

Staying loyal: Leighton Baines signed a new deal at Everton despite interest from Manchester United

Sadly the people running social media forums and the people running the country are reinforcing the message that such abuse is acceptable by doing nothing to prevent it or punish it.

One example from this week: on my talkSPORT radio show we asked if Leighton Baines had ‘bottled it’ by staying at Everton and not seeking a move to a club regularly winning trophies and playing in the Champions League.

My view was that Baines’ wish to stay at Everton and help them try to achieve greatness was admirable. Remarkably some Everton fans thought this was a signal for them to fire abuse at me. One threatening tweet suggested I should ‘watch out’ next time I’m at Goodison Park. Whoever posted it later deleted it.

I’ve seen pundits threatened with murder because they tweet about football. I’ve seen anonymous tweeters start campaigns falsely accusing ex-pros and pundits of being paedophiles because they offer an opinion on football.

I’ve seen grown men who claim to be a ‘proud father’ in their Twitter profile tweet all sorts of vile, disgusting abuse and threats to people they don’t even know, simply because they disagree with a football opinion.

God help their children who will be growing up using a man with no moral compass whatsoever as a role model. They won’t know right from wrong.

I’ve even seen tweets saying pundits should expect to be threatened with murder if they offer an opinion on football.

A debate about football is exactly that. How an individual can possibly think it is right to shift that debate into something sinister is beyond me.

For me personally, I can try to educate people to be decent and just talk about football rather than be abusive, but I can’t possibly get upset about a total stranger with a sick mind tweeting abuse to me.

But not everyone is as strong. If one day these unchecked threats lead to the suicide of someone receiving them, or an aggressive twitter user decides to follow through with a threat for real, then Twitter, and all those who choose to ignore the message I’m conveying here, will have blood on their hands.

I sincerely hope that sickening scenario never comes true.
