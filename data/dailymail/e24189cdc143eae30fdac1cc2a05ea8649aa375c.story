Taking two bites of his McChicken burger, Adelaide man James Parsons knew there was something seriously 'gross'.

Mr Parsons, 26, runs a pool maintenance business and was between jobs on Monday when he ordered the burger for lunch from Reynella McDonalds drive-thru, south of Adelaide CBD at about 1pm.

'He got the burger, took the first bite and thought "this isn't warm",' his wife Philippa told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was starving and on the run - he took the second bite and looked down and the whole patty was raw.'

'Gross': Adelaide man James Parsons was shocked when he discovered his cold McChicken burger contained what he believes was a raw patty in it

The couple live in Hallett Cove, south of Adelaide CBD and Mrs Parsons, 26, said her husband was 'grossed' by what he believes was raw chicken.

'It's put us both off... I doubt he'll eat McDonalds again,' she said. 'I can't say I'll never eat it again, but I definitely won't for a while,' she said.

Mr Parson's immediate reaction to his shocking find, was to pull over his car and call the McDonalds restaurant to advise them about his discovery.

'They told him to bring the burger back and they would replace it and he said: 'That's not good enough",' she said.

After contacting the store Mr Parsons was told he could get a replacement if he took the burger back

At this point Mr Parsons called his wife, who was not with him at the time, to tell her what had happened.

'I said we need to do something about this - we need to make people be careful. I'm 30 weeks pregnant and if that happened to me it could have killed the baby,' she said.

Mrs Parsons then called the South Australia McDonalds head office to alert them about the incident.

After explaining that the store offered to replace the burger when contacted, Mrs Parsons reiterated that this was not good enough.

She was then asked if the couple still had the burger, and if so to take photos to send to the company.

Once Mr Parsons came home and gave the burger to his wife, Mrs Parsons took some images and sent them in an email and was told the incident would be investigated and someone would get back to her.

Mrs Parsons said she was surprised her husband had not been seriously ill from eating what he believes was raw chicken.

'He hasn't at all been sick, which is lucky - he's grown up in the country and has quite a cast iron stomach,' she said.

'I actually nearly rang the hospital to see whether there was something he could take to prevent food poisoning - we weren't sure way to do about eating raw chicken.'

On Wednesday, a spokesman for McDonalds told Daily Mail Australia: 'We are disappointed that this has happened.

'We take food safety very seriously and have strict processes and systems in place. We are currently investigating this with the restaurant and liaising with the customer directly.'

As of Tuesday night, Mrs Parsons had yet to hear anything more from McDonalds, despite sending a followup email earlier in the day.

'I sent an email to the same guy asking what was going on and if there was any report and I haven't received an email back,' she said.

Mr Parson's wife Philippa took photos of the burger and sent them to the McDonalds South Australia head office

Mrs Parsons said she was outraged at how what she believes was raw patty, could have made it into the burger.

'I think we should be getting some kind of compensation - I don't know what but it's so dangerous, there's no excuse,' she said. 'It's such a big franchise, I would think it would be so well monitored.'

After Mrs Parsons took the photos of the burger, she posted the images of the patty on her personal Facebook page. 'People were disgusted and they shared the photo,' she said.

Mrs Parsons said the burger is currently in her freezer.
