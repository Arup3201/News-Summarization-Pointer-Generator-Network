A plain-package law for tobacco products would reduce the appeal of smoking, according to a new study.

This follows the recent legislation in Australia banning logos from cigarette packaging and the English ban on tobacco promotion in April this year.

England has some of the strictest anti-smoking laws in the world with advertising and smoking in pubs and restaurants already banned, but new research claims that removing logos from cigarette packs would reduce the appeal even further.

Logo no-go: The research supports the introduction of plain packaging as it reduced the appeal of smoking

In Britain a consultation was made by the Department of Health on plain packaging last month, the results of which have yet to be published.

British Public Health Minister Anne Milton have said that the government is already considering whether plain packaging of tobacco could bring public health benefits in this country.

The research suggests that plain packaging and the removal of brand descriptors are likely to reduce the appeal of smoking for young adults, supporting the recommendations for plain packaging.

The study was made by a research group at the University of Waterloo, Canada.

The report, published today in Biomed Central’s open access journal BMC Public Health, compared the appeal of branded and plain packs among women in Brazil.

The authors found that many brands appear to specifically target young women by use of ‘feminine’ coloured packs, fruit flavourings, or by suggestive terms such as ‘slim’ or ‘superslim’.

The women were quizzed to see if these cigarettes had the same appeal when presented in plain packaging which still had the brand name and description on them.

As a final test, the women were able to choose which they would have preferred as a free gift, one of the plain or branded pack.

Dr David Hammond also from the University of Waterloo who led this study explained: ‘The women in this study rated branded packs as more appealing, more stylish and sophisticated than the plain packs.

‘They also thought that cigarettes in branded packs would be better tasting and smoother.

‘Removal of all description from the packs, leaving only the brand, further reduced their appeal.

‘In the pack offer test, participants were three times more likely to choose the branded pack as a free gift.’

Benefits: Introducing plain packaging could reduce the number of young people taking up smoking

Tobacco use is responsible for 5.4 million deaths every year across the world and is a leading cause of preventable death.

Like many other countries, Brazil has prohibited most forms of tobacco advertising, but has not addressed the issue of marketing by tobacco companies via the cigarette pack itself.

The results from this study, the first to look at the effect of plain cigarette, backs up research in other countries, which has found that plain packaging makes cigarettes less appealing to young people, the authors noted.
