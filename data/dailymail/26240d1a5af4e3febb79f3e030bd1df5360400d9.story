One of the most acclaimed ballet dancers of our time has hinted that the classical art is in crisis.

'We need more girls... girls are non-existent,' said Carlos Acosta, 40, of the lack of top-level female ballet dancers, those of an equal stature to himself.

The Royal Ballet school of London agrees with him, revealing that while over the last few years overwhelmingly more girls apply in younger years, by age 16 there are more boys than girls actually studying at the School.

'Our directors have found it more of a 
challenge to find really talented girls in the past few years. The wave 
of talented boys has continued as the myth that ballet is for girls is 
even more widely dispelled,' said a spokesperson for the school.

As young girls dream to star in Swan Lake they find the reality is not so glamorous. Women in the profession are notoriously pushed to their limits as they are encouraged to keep their weight down yet perform extreme physical challenges.

Acosta, speaking with the Independent, posed solutions to the problem of falling numbers.

'If you find talented young dancers, then give them a scholarship,' he says. 'Not just one or two people but all the talented dancers. That way we have more chance to deliver to the world the next Darcey Bussell or Tamara Rojo.'

And if Britain can't deliver top-level professionals, he calls on us to look abroad.

'If you don’t have talent in your own backyard, you must go and find it. Whether it comes from Italy, Nigeria or South America it doesn’t matter. We should do more to look elsewhere and give people a chance to flourish.'

Acosta danced his Romeo to Tamara Rojo's Juliet in the 2011 and 2013 production of the Shakespearean tragic love story.

He has a daughter of his own, little Aila Acosta-Holland, with Charlotte Holland.

Acosta calls for scholarships to be given out to all talented dancers, not just one or two, in the hope of finding the next Tamara Rojo (pictured at an event, left, and performing with Acosta, right) or Darcey Bussell
