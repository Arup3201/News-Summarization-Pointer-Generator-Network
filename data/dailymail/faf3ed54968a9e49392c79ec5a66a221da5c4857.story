A furious debate erupted over Press regulation yesterday after more than 40 Tories called on David Cameron to consider passing laws to police the media.

In a letter to the Guardian, senior figures including former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind and two former party chairmen, Caroline Spelman and Lord Fowler, said proposals for a tough system of self-regulation did not go far enough.

They claimed that statutory regulation of broadcasters had not prevented TV channels from running investigative journalism and exposing wrongdoing.

Tory MPs have told David Cameron not to rule out the possibility of statutory Press regulation

And they suggested the Prime Minister 
should keep open the door to some form of state regulation when Lord 
Justice Leveson publishes the findings of his inquiry into Press ethics 
later this month.

They also called for a single standard to assess public interest, which could be ‘applied independently and consistently’.

Several of the signatories have faced embarrassing Press scrutiny into 
their conduct in the past and their intervention provoked a backlash 
from other MPs who described their views as ‘disappointing and 
misguided’.

John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport 
committee, said: ‘I would have thought most Conservatives would be very 
wary of any government legislative involvement in the regulation of the 
Press.

‘I am opposed to any kind of statutory regulation of the Press, including statutory underpinning.

‘While I understand the strength of feeling that some action needs to be
taken, given the behaviour by sections of the Press has been so bad, I 
think the new regulatory system proposed by the industry, which includes
new powers that were not there before, deserves to be given a chance.’

Philip Davies, a Tory member of the culture committee, said: ‘They are 
trying to have it both ways and you can’t. It’s like pregnancy – you 
can’t be a bit pregnant and you can’t have partial state interference. 
You either have a free Press or you don’t.’

Several senior Cabinet ministers including Education Secretary Michael 
Gove, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Chancellor George Osborne 
are also opposed to state regulation of any kind. Mr Cameron is thought 
to be reluctant to involve the state in Press regulation, but is under 
pressure to accept Lord Leveson’s recommendations, which are expected to
call for at least statutory ‘underpinning’ for a new regulator.

Lord Black, chairman of the funding body for the Press Complaints 
Commission, told the Leveson Inquiry he wanted a form of ‘muscular’ 
self-regulation. That would mean a new organisation with the power to 
launch investigations and levy fines of up to £1million.

Yesterday’s letter calling for a ‘genuinely independent system’ was 
co-ordinated by Mr Cameron’s former Press secretary George Eustice and 
fellow Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi.

Mr Zahawi told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he was ‘instinctively 
opposed’ to statutory Press regulation but had changed his mind after 
hearing evidence of Press abuses.

He said a new regulator would not have to be ‘invasive’, and cited the Advertising Standards Authority as a possible model.

Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator magazine, said the prospect of regulation was already having an insidious effect.

‘I, as an editor, am getting MPs and ministers calling me up to order 
that I discipline writers who displease them or take articles down in a 
way that they wouldn’t have even a year ago because the feeling is going
around amongst politicians that, finally, they are going to get their 
say in how the Press should behave.

Injunction: Caroline Spelman

Caroline Spelman is one of several of the newspaper letter’s signatories to have crossed swords with the Press.

During the 2009 expenses scandal, it emerged she claimed £40,000 for cleaning and bills at her £2million, 15-bedroom Georgian mansion near Solihull.

The Tory politician was also forced to apologise and pay back £9,600 of allowances she ‘inadvertently’ misused to pay her children’s nanny.

MPs on the Commons standards and privileges committee said that in 1997 and 1998 – when her son Jonny was three – she overpaid her nanny £4,800 a year in return for secretarial work, meaning her childcare was ‘cross-subsidised’.

Her appointment in 2010 as Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary prompted questions about her impartiality and apparent willingness to put the interests of business and farmers above those of the consumer.

Her background was as an agricultural scientist and in the early 1980s she was sugar beet commodity secretary for the National Farmers’ Union, which supports both GM and clone animals.

In 1989, she and her husband Marc set up a lobbying firm to promote the food and biotech industries. Following her appointment as Secretary of State in 2010, she revealed she supported the introduction of GM crops ‘under the right circumstances’.

This sparked a Mail investigation into the Spelmans’ links to the lobby industry. She maintained there was no conflict of interest.

In March she lost a High Court bid to hush up revelations that her rugby-playing son Jonny took banned steroids.

The MP spent over £60,000 on legal fees after obtaining a gagging order preventing reporting of the drug-taking.

But Mrs Spelman abandoned her controversial injunction after a judge ruled in favour of the public’s right to know.

Last December, Zac Goldsmith, another Tory MP to sign the Guardian letter, compared tabloids to the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz when he gave evidence to a parliamentary committee on privacy.

Sitting alongside actors Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, the MP rejected arguments that newspapers should be given free rein to print stories about the private lives of the famous so that they can remain financially viable.

The multi-millionaire said: ‘If the only way a business can stay afloat is by engaging in immoral or unethical behaviour, then that business should either change its model or go out of business.

‘No one said that Auschwitz should have been kept open because it created jobs.’

The MP was appearing before the committee because he had previously obtained a so-called super-injunction preventing the publication of private emails which had been leaked to the Press.

In 2006, Tory MP Mark Field, who signed the letter, was revealed to have had a brief affair with one of the party’s A-list candidates, Liz Truss. The relationship began when Miss Truss, who is now an MP, worked for the married Mr Field.

Bob Stewart, a fourth Tory signatory, caused a scandal in 1993 when he left his wife for Claire Podbielski. He met the aid worker when he was colonel commanding British UN troops in Bosnia.

They later married but the affair blighted his military prospects. Mr Stewart was not dismissed but his career was effectively ended by senior officers’ disapproval.
