Disgraced former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky says he's trying to 'learn and grow' in prison and bemoans his trial lacked 'justice and fairness' in a newly-revealed handwritten letter.

Sandusky, 68, has been sitting in the Pennsylvania jail cell since he was convicted of 45 counts of sexually abusing 10 boys over a period of 15 years while he served as the college football team's defensive coordinator.

It was revealed during the widely-watched case that he met and groomed his victims through his charity, The Second Mile.

Reaching out: The letter, scrawled on both sides of a thin scrap of paper, is dated December 18 and addressed to The Citizens' Voice reporter Michael Sisak

The letter, scrawled on both sides of a thin scrap of paper, is dated December 18 and addressed to The Citizens' Voice reporter Michael Sisak.

Sandusky opens the letter with an apology for the odd paper.

He writes: 'Please excuse the paper and informality. I’ve had some problems with commissary which has delayed my response and created a paper problem.'

Sandusky thanks Sisak for his interview request and says that although he 'has a lot to say,' he has been advised against it while he focuses on his appeal.

But he goes on to explain his problems with his trial, explaining that it was conducted without 'justice and fairness' and how he is now trying to 'learn and grow' from his 'struggles.'

Sandusky closes with a list of his goals that he 'mentally' tells himself. The first letter of each line spells out the word ENDURE.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that Sandusky lives under tight restrictions in prison for his own safety, and housed outside of the general population

He is on hard routine after he asked for more prison privileges and then received threats from inmates.

'He is being housed in the appropriate facility in order to assure his safety,' said Susan McNaughton, press secretary for the Pennsylvania state Department of Corrections.

She responded to questions from Reuters after one of Sandusky's lawyers complained that his client was confined to his cell 23 hours a day.

Sandusky's attorney, Karl Rominger, said that his client is 'being treated like the worst of the worst in the state prison system in terms of his daily routine.'

He said Sandusky is treated like extremely violent offenders, or those on death row.

He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.

The scandal sparked a national debate over child sex abuse, embarrassed the university and implicated a number of its top officials including legendary football head coach, the late Joe Paterno.

There has been speculation that Sandusky would be threatened by other inmates in prison if he was given more privileges.

Sandusky, who has maintained his innocence, is in a 1,800-inmate maximum security prison that serves as death row for the state.

Rominger said he would like to see Sandusky transferred to a less restrictive prison that houses inmates who are less violent.

Michael, 

Please excuse the paper and informality. I’ve had some problems with commissary which has delayed my response and created a paper problem.

I appreciate your interest in interviewing me. At this time there is much I would like to say. However, because of appeals, etc., I have been advised against it. It would also take some time here to make that possible.

Our position in this could change in the future. Right now, our focus is on appeal. There is much to learn, issues and information, not presented. Nobody, who caused the case and reported it had the time or took the time to study the allegations, the accusers, the inconsistency and the methods. Justice and fairness were not a focus.

If you want, stay in touch as this evolves. In the meantime, I’m trying to learn from, grow from and endure the struggles and circumstances. I talk to myself (only mentally) with a goal - mostly follow:

E - Embrace each day as a gift.N - Never surrender except to God.D - Don't let your situation get the best of you.U - Understand God's purpose and presence.R - Remain as positive as possible.E - Exercise your mind, body and spirit.

Jerry Sandusky
