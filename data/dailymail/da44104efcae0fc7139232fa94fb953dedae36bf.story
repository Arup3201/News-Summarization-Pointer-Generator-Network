Childhood photos of Monty Python star Eric Idle which were taken by his mother have gone up for sale after he sold her house and all its contents.

An old box containing more than 150 unpublished family photos was snapped up by an anonymous buyer when he put the Warwickshire home on the market after his mother passed away in 1996.

The collection also includes hand written postcards sent home from one of the Python’s worldwide tours, his school reports and photos of him in drag.

A picture of a young Eric Idle, taken in the 1950s, is among the collection snapped up by an anonymous buyer

Now the revealing collection has gone back up for sale and is expected to fetch £7,000 at an auction in Gloucestershire next month.

Auctioneer Chris Albury, from Dominic Winter auctioneers, said: ‘When Eric Idle’s mum Norah passed away in 1996 from what we understand he remotely organised the sale of the house.

‘This material was among that collection of effects. It was just in a huge box, and it has taken till now to sort through it and discover its significance.

‘Python material doesn’t turn up very frequently. It is a very candid and personal - not in a negative way, just in that it is Eric Idle being himself.

Photographed in the 1960s, Idle was born in South Shields and sent to boarding school when he was seven

Alongside his mother's Ford Popular - the family's first car. The collection of photographs is now up for sale

‘There is a school report which shows that perhaps unsurprisingly he got his highest marks in English - 85 per cent I think.

‘There are signed books from the other Pythons also. It seems Norah was well-liked by them, and in books from Michael Palin the two appear to share inside jokes.’

Treasured postcards from Idle to his mother will go under the hammer, including one from Berlin in the 1960s when he talks about the divided city.

Photo's, including this one on a photo contact sheet from 1940s, are expected to fetch £7,000 in an auction

Alongside a group of friends, Idle (circled) is pictured at Butlins in 1950s. Apart from supporting his local football team, Wolverhampton Wanders, he hated sport as a youngster

Writing in blue fountain pen, he said: ‘We went on a tour of the East this afternoon. Very good.

‘Berlin is a wonderful city but the situation is very complex. We have seen the wall.’

In a postcard from Canada around the same time, he tells his mother of the great reception from fans.

‘Show going very well - fired up and excellent audiences,’ he wrote.

The almost 200-piece collection also contains a pencil-written letter home from Wolverhampton School asking his mother to ‘not bring salad, only bring strawberries’.

His schoolboy stamp collection, a signed poster of the Monty Python’s First Farewell Tour, and personal snaps of the team relaxing between shows are also included.

Experts expect it will be bought by a publisher hoping to make a new book for fans.

Mr Albury said: ‘It could go to a fan or possibly to a publisher. It would make a good fan tribute book if the legalities can be sorted out with Eric Idle himself.’

The collection will go up for sale as one lot on Wednesday, October 8.
