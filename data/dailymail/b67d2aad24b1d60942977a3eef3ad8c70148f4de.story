When the family of an 89-year-old woman feared she was being mistreated in her care home, they hid a small CCTV camera in an alarm clock to check up on her.

And their worst worries came true when two carers were caught on camera committing 'sickening' acts of verbal and physical abuse, a court heard yesterday.

Ivy Robinson, who has dementia, was hit, shaken, sworn at, dragged across the bedroom floor and not given the correct doses of her medication by the staff who were supposed to be looking after her.

Abuse: CCTV captures Ivy Robinson, 89, being dragged from a chair to her bed as she looks in pain. Ivy was subjected to a catalogue of abuse by her carers before her family captured her mistreatment on a hidden camera

The shocking footage led to senior 
carer Emma Bryan, 29, and colleague Katherine Wallis, 45, being arrested
for the appalling acts of neglect.

Yesterday Bryan was jailed for four 
months at Leeds Crown Court and Wallis given a 12-month community order 
after admitting mistreating Mrs Robinson  at Oakfoss House Residential 
Care  Home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, last November.

Passing sentence, Judge Guy Kearl, QC, told them: 'This neglect and ill-treatment is unforgivable and unacceptable.

'You failed to accord for the respect and dignity of this respectful and elderly lady.'

The judge said the victim's daughter, 
Angela Wood, 'had believed she had placed her mother in a safe 
environment' and it 'turned out to be anything but'.

Richard Butters, prosecuting, told the
court the footage captured over a  five-day period showed Mrs Robinson 
was subjected to an array of 'utterly undignified' treatment. Mrs 
Robinson had lived at the home for six years and Mrs Wood had given up 
her job to help the care home staff look after her.

However, Mrs Wood and her husband 
Simon were worried about bruises on her  mother's hands and the fact she
became 'distressed' when they left in the evening. Mrs Robinson often 
cried and asked her daughter not to go.

To allay their suspicions Mr Wood set up the spy camera in his mother-in-law's bedroom and the damning footage showed:

■ Both Bryan and Wallis dragging Mrs Robinson from a chair to her bed, with the pensioner 'shrieking' as they did it;

■ Mrs Robinson being called a 'horrible old lady', a 'silly old t***' and a 'nasty old cow' by Bryan;

■ The same carer striking Mrs Robinson on the hand and shaking her before telling her to 'p*** off'.

Mr Butters said the footage showed 
both carers manhandling Mrs Robinson 'in a totally unauthorised manner',
using a banned method of lifting.

A training instructor was shown the video and what she saw left her 'completely shocked' and 'physically upset'.

'In her opinion this was the worst 
case of ill treatment and neglect and abuse of trust that she has ever 
seen in her years in this  profession,' he added.

Mr Butters told the court Mrs 
Robinson's daughter 'is sickened and horrified by the treatment 
administered to her mother', adding: 'She can't stop thinking about it, 
she often bursts into tears.'

Bryan admitted four counts of wrongly 
administering medicine. Both women, from Pontefract, also admitted one 
charge of ill-treatment. They have been placed on the Independent 
Safeguarding List, stopping them from working with vulnerable adults 
again.  Matthew Harding, for Bryan, said his client 'recognises that her
behaviour was disgraceful'.

Stephen Swan, for Wallis, said she also regretted her actions.

Judge Kearl told them: 'This lady 
doesn't seem to have caused you any problems at all, which makes this 
treatment seem somewhat gratuitous. You've known perfectly well that 
what you were doing was simply wrong.'

Daughter Angela Wood and her husband Simon are pictured leaving court after the verdict. Mrs Wood installed the camera to capture the abuse after she thought something was wrong

After the case Mrs Wood said: 'It is difficult to describe the effect this abuse has had on Mum.

'This will never leave our memories. Moreover, we feel as though we have let Mum down.'

She said the decision to install a 
camera was a 'last resort' and followed 'various incidents over a period
of months that could not be explained' by care home staff.

Mrs Wood added: 'No one knows how long
this abuse and neglect had been going on for. We hope that other 
families can learn from Mum's ordeal and be aware of certain signs.

'Just because someone has dementia does not mean that they do not know what is going on. Please listen to them and act.'

The family are now moving Mrs Robinson from the care home to give her 'the care she deserves.'

Oakfoss House is a 22-bedroom home for
the elderly and those with dementia. The fees are £402 per week, which 
were met by social services in the case of Mrs Robinson, a 
mother-of-two, whose other daughter died in 1999.

Gaynor Saunders, managing director of 
care home owners Denestar Ltd, said: 'I was devastated to learn that two
longstanding, experienced employees who'd been given extensive training
in caring for and safeguarding elderly and vulnerable people had 
behaved in such an abhorrent way. Words cannot express how sorry I am.'
