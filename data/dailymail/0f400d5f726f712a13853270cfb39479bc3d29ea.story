One of Paveet Landa's relatives, Chamkh Singh, appears at Isleworth Crown Court charged with kidnapping

A Sikh family 'kidnapped and imprisoned' their female relative's secret boyfriend to stop them marrying, a court heard.

Paveet Landa's fled her home to escape an arranged marriage so she could elope with her partner Ramanjit Singh, a builder who is of a lower caste than her.

But the 20-year-old's father, mother, older brother and other relatives traced him to a Southall Sikh Temple, where he was trying to book them a marriage ceremony, and allegedly imprisoned him.

The nursery nurse's father Balvinder Singh, mother Rani Landa, older brother Lakhanpal and other relatives found him in August last year.

In a bid to stop the service going ahead the next day, the three close family members briefly imprisoned Mr Singh, who eventually broke free and called police, a jury heard.

But the family intensified efforts to find Paveet, the Evening Standard reported.

Next day, the morning of Paveet's wedding, they allegedly kidnapped her friend Harjinder Singh at knifepoint and her father threatened to kill him if he did not disclose their whereabouts.

It is claimed he said: 'Tell me where Ramanjit lives — I’ll cut him up into pieces.'

When Harjinder denied all knowledge of the couple’s location, Paveet’s father allegedly punched him in the face, drew a knife and added: 'I’ll cut your throat now. You’d better tell me where she is or I will kill you.'

Opening the four-week trial at Isleworth Crown Court, prosecutor Ian McLoughlin said the case arose from 'a breakdown caused by Paveet’s decision not to marry the groom the family chose for her but to elope with the man she loved.

'This caused the family to pursue her and to threaten and attack her friends to reveal her whereabouts.

'She knew that her family couldn’t accept Ramanjit as a suitable husband. He was from a different caste, was from India and didn’t speak any English.' Questioned over her proposed arranged marriage to Vikram Shari, Paveet said she had 'gone along with it' at first to please her parents.

But she claimed she was allowed to meet Mr Shari just once and spoke sporadically to him on the phone. During that time, she told the court, she became attracted to Ramanjit, who worked at the same nursery in Ilford, and the pair began a secret relationship.

Paveet said from behind a dock screen to shield herself from her family that she did not want a life with the man chosen for her.

She said: 'I wasn’t going to be happy so I decided to run away with Ramanjit and get married.'

The court heard that 10 family members traced Ramanjit, called him 'sister-f*****' and demanded to know where Paveet was hiding. He broke free and returned to his fiancée at a hotel.

But on the morning of the wedding next day the family allegedly kidnapped Harjinder and threatened him with death if he did not help.

Balvinder Singh, 42, Rani Landa, also 42, and Lakhanpal Landa, 21, have been charged with falsely imprisoning Ramanjit.

They have also been charged with kidnapping Harjinder by force, along with relatives Hemat Landa, 40, Chamkh Singh, 42, Kamaljit Singh, 33, and a 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

Balvinder has also been charged with making a threat to kill Harjinder and unlawful possession of a knife. All plead not guilty.

The trial continues.
