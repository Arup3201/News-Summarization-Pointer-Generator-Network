Jeremy Clarkson visited his producer's home to apologise for their Top Gear altercation but was given the cold shoulder, it was claimed last night.

The BBC investigation into the row has been told Oisin Tymon refused to even open the door to the presenter after he turned up at his house, according to a report.

Sources said the incident happened four days after 54-year-old Clarkson allegedly punched Mr Tymon during an argument after filming over a hot meal at a North Yorkshire hotel.

The claims emerged as it was revealed Clarkson and his co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May are still scheduled to host a Top Gear Live arena show in Norway next week.

The top-rating show was pulled off air and Clarkson was suspended while an inquiry was launched. It has also been claimed that Clarkson has sent at least one apologetic email to Mr Tymon.

Ken MacQuarrie, the BBC executive in charge of the inquiry, has reportedly been shown the contents of the emails.

A source told the Daily Mirror: ‘In the hours before he reported the matter to the BBC, Clarkson seemed increasingly desperate to apologise to Oisin and persuade him to let the matter blow over.

‘When he arrived on the doorstep that Sunday, Oisin was not feeling ready to face him so didn’t answer. He just didn’t want to speak to him after what happened.

‘Clarkson could be heard saying that he just wanted to talk. He was asking for the door to be opened but it didn’t work. He tried for up to five minutes but in the end had to walk away.’

Far from patching things up with the Corporation, the presenter appears to be creating further tension after launching a foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses during a charity gala last night.

Speaking in north London to raise money to help disadvantaged youths, said that he wanted to do one more lap of the show’s track ‘before the ‘f****** b******* sack me’.

In footage obtained by the Daily Mirror, he spoke to the Roundhouse audience about a charity auction for his ‘last ever lap’ on the Top Gear track - which later went for £100,000.

Clarkson said: ‘I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap. So I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me.

‘I'll be a bit tearful when I do it, but f*** it, let's do it. And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of. I'm sacked so it's probably an Austin Maestro.'

He added: 'There was an 18-year waiting list to be in the audience of Top Gear, but the BBC has f***** themselves.’ 

Although Top Gear has been taken off air, tickets are still on sale for the four performances of the live show in Norway, which will take place next Friday and Saturday. Up to 5,000 people are expected to attend each one.

Meanwhile, it was also revealed last night that Clarkson's future on the BBC is likely to be decided next week when the corporation's internal investigation into his behaviour is handed over to the director-general.

A BBC Worldwide source told The Daily Telegraph: ‘At the moment we are taking things on a day by day basis and as things stand the [Norway] shows are scheduled to run as billed.

‘It is not happening tomorrow, it is happening in eight days' time, so we are waiting to see what the investigation delivers.

‘No-one is really sure about the timing of the investigation's decision, so before we disappoint 20,000 fans in Norway, at the moment we are going ahead with the show.’

The Top Gear host has been suspended since it emerged he was involved in what the BBC called ‘a fracas’ with one of the show's producers.

It was reported this week that Clarkson's Top Gear co-hosts declined an offer to continue the rest of the series without him.

The last episodes of the series have been postponed, causing the BBC to lose millions of viewers and receive thousands of complaints.
