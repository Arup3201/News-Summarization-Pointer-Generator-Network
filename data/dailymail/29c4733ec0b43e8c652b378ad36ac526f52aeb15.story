New Burton manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink considers the question carefully.

Would guiding the club to promotion from League Two this season beat anything he achieved as a Premier League star?

‘I think so,’ says Hasselbaink. ‘Because this would be harder.

‘But it’s not about League Two, League One or the Championship, it’s about the project for me. When the question was always of me which league I wanted to start in? I don’t look at that.

‘It’s the challenge — does it fit with me? Can I add to it? That’s why I’m here.’

Hasselbaink is sat at Burton’s Pirelli Stadium after being unveiled as the club’s new manager on a two-and-a-half-year contract worth just £40,000-a-year.

On Sunday night, his first managerial job in English football begins with a trip to promotion rivals Wycombe Wanderers which will certainly add a few more viewers to the live television coverage.

‘Without football, I would not be a happy bunny, I would not be a happy person at all,’ Hasselbaink says. ‘At home, I have a television dedicated to me. It is tuned in to football all the time.

With training facilities at England’s St George’s Park HQ nearby and a chairman, Ben Robinson, who gave Nigel Clough and Gary Rowett their big breaks, Hasselbaink is convinced he has made the right choice .

‘When Burton Albion became available, I jumped at it. It’s a brilliant opportunity for me,’ he says. 

‘This is a stable, well-run family club with a good chairman and the right ideas. I see myself as the right man for this club.’
