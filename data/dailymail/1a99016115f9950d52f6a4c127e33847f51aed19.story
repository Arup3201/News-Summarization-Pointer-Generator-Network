England should try and follow Germany's example in producing youth teams who can develop together and form the core of the senior national side, according to Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce.

Many of the Germany team who have reached Sunday's World Cup final via their 7-1 humbling of hosts Brazil were also in the under-21 team who trounced England 4-0 in the final of the 2009 European under-21 championships.

Boyce, who is also head of UEFA's youth committee, told Press Association Sport: 'The Brazil v Germany semi-final was astounding, the performance of the German team was something else.

'But I have been chairman of UEFA's youth committee for many years and I have seen how the Germans have built up their policy.

'From that team many played at under-19 level, then at under-21 level and in fact won the 2009 European under-21 championships. Like the Belgians, the Germans decided they were starting on that policy and saw it through.

'I think England need to start doing something like that because the Germans are now reaping the benefits.'

Boyce, who is from Northern Ireland, believes this tournament is unmatched in terms of quality. He added: 'It has been probably the best World Cup ever.

'We have seen some tremendous matches. There were a lot of worries before the tournament, security was a big concern, stadiums were a big concern, but in fairness it has gone a lot better than people expected.

'Brazil deserves an awful lot of credit because there was a lot of speculation there would be big problems.'

Boyce is also head of FIFA's referees committee and insisted there has been no policy - as has been suggested by some - of telling officials to show restraint in the number of bookings.

He said: 'I think the refereeing has been superb, and it has not happened by chance. I have seen all the courses and seminars, listened to the instructors, and spoken to the referees and they have told me they have never had such good preparation for a World Cup.

'The referees have been told to only send a player off if they were 100% certain it was a red card, but nothing has ever been said about being lenient.'
