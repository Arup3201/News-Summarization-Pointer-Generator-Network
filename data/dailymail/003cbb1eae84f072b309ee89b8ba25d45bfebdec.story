Dotted with insects and oozing with worms, at first glance this meal looks like it is ready for the bin. 

But the creepy-crawly festive feast is the creation of Peter Bickerton, who will be tucking into his insect-filled meal on Christmas Day.

For the main course there is nut-roast filled with crickets served with Brussels sprouts and locusts, and covered in mealworm vegetable gravy.

Dessert will be a choice of mealworm Christmas pudding or locust mince pies.

Mr Bickerton believes his insect-inspired menu is a much more sustainable, protein-rich and healthy alternative to the conventional Christmas dinner.

The 25-year-old from from Blackburn, Lancashire, said: 'I'm definitely going to be eating bugs this Christmas.

'I've never liked turkey - it's dry, bland and boring.

'A cricket nut roast is a far more delectable and exciting alternative for your holiday lunch.

'People waste a lot of food at Christmas but insects are very low waste. 

'The amount of water, grain and resources that you need to rear livestock is ridiculous.

Genius combination: Locusts  on the Brussels sprouts provide a crunch to the otherwise soggy offering

'If people ate less cow, sheep, pig and chicken and ate more bugs instead, everything would balance.'

Peter - who works as an Education & Public Engagement Officer at Norwich University - claims that the tiny critters are delicious in a Christmas lunch.

He explains: 'Once people get over the initial yuck factor of creepy-crawlies, they'll be pleasantly surprised by the taste. Crickets are naturally quite a nutty flavour so taste perfect in a roast.

'Locusts are low fat but still very juicy so that goes wonderfully with Brussels sprouts. It's a very similar pairing to bacon and cabbage - it's a genius combination.

'A Christmas pudding can be overly sweet sometimes but the mealworms add a crunch and texture to it.

Mr Bickerton - who recently completed his PhD in Plant Studies - first ate insects on a field-trip to Ecuador in 2009.

'A native tribe brought some three-inch-long, barbecued beetle larvae for us to try. 

'It was just like an incredible explosion of taste in my mouth, I had never eaten anything like it.'

But it was only in 2011 that he started doing more research into insect eating - or entomophagy.

'I discovered that insects have twice as much protein than beef and far more omega-3 fatty acids than in fish. 

'In fact, research has shown that 100g of locusts for example has more nutrients than any other meat,' he said. 

These findings led Mr Bickerton to start incorporating bugs regularly into his diet. 

He orders his creepy-crawlies from a live breeder in Somerset. 

He has now replaced all the meat dishes he ate with insect protein instead and is even hoping to get insects on his workplace canteen menu.

'I talked to the chef at my Norwich University about putting bugs on the menu and he seemed really interested.

'Far more chefs are using insects in their cooking and there are bug kitchens opening up across Europe. It's only a matter of time before everyone is eating them!

'If anyone wants to put insects on their plate this Christmas, the first thing to do is search entomophagy on Twitter and you'll find several companies that sell edible bugs.'
