The spurned wife of Great British Bake Off star Paul Hollywood returned to their family home yesterday, looking strained as rumours circulated about her husband’s relationship with his glamorous co-star.

Dejected Alexandra Hollywood was pictured without her wedding ring as she returned to the 13th Century Kent mansion she shared with the baker, but declined to comment on the split.

Meanwhile, her husband jetted back out to America to be reunited with his TV co-host Marcela Valladolid, who has been rumoured to be a factor in the collapse of his 15-year marriageIt was Alexandra’s first appearance since news of her marriage split was confirmed on Friday.

As she arrived at the marital house in the village of Wingham, near Canterbury, in a Mercedes 4x4, a male friend who accompanied her said: ‘She doesn’t want to talk, she is just going into her house.’

A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘Alexandra is very upset and will not want to be talking to anyone about this. It’s all very sad.’

Mr Hollywood’s agent confirmed that the baker had left his wife and their 11-year-old son Josh in the family home and had moved into a rented studio flat nearby.

Divorcee Ms Valladolid, 34, had been linked to the break-up after striking up a close relationship with the 47-year-old Wirral-born star as they filmed the US TV series, The American Baking Competition, on which they are both judges.

A single mother-of-one, Ms Valladolid has described her co-star as a ‘handsome devil’ and the pair have exchanged numerous playful messages and photographs over Twitter.

When Marcela was directly asked about her relationship with Hollywood yesterday, she smiled and shrugged, but declined to deny rumours of an affair.  She remained tight-lipped when questioned outside her brother Antonio’s £1.5 million mansion in Chula Vista, Southern California, speaking only to say: ‘Have a beautiful day.’

However her sister-in-law Lisa  insisted reports that Marcella was involved in the Hollywoods’ marriage split were wide of the mark.  She said: ‘She’d find that very funny, she only has to have a sandwich with someone and they’re supposedly living together.’

Mr Hollywood, former head baker at The Dorchester hotel in London, has become a housewives’ favourites since getting his break alongside 78-year-old baking queen Mary Berry on The Great British Bake Off in 2010. He, too, has declined to comment on the split.

Marcela allegedly became close to Hollywood as the pair filmed in Georgia, in America’s Deep South, over March and April. They reportedly ‘hit it off from day one’.

Last weekend Mr Hollywood arrived solo at the Bafta awards ceremony, sparking rumours of a marriage split. He later cancelled a book signing in Glasgow, scheduled for yesterday, as well.

Ms Valladolid trained as  a chef in Los Angeles and Paris, before starting her own catering company in Tijuana, Mexico. 

She became a TV chef after taking part in the 2005 US series of The Apprentice. She appeared as guest chef on America’s Food Network before being signed up as America’s answer to Mary Berry on The American Baking Competition. 

She was previously married to her childhood sweetheart Fausto Gallardo Garcia, and the couple have a nine-year-son, also named Fausto.

There had been reports that the couple had reconciled and remarried, but Ms Valladolid’s sister- in-law Lisa insisted: ‘No, definitely not. They’re not back together. But they’re still friends.’

The agent for the British chef confirmed the break-up saying: ‘Paul Hollywood has split from his wife.  Their priority is protecting their son. He will be making no further comment on this private matter.’
