Sotheby's is being sued over claims a painting it sold for £42,000 was actually a £10million Caravaggio.

The bitter legal battle was sparked by Lancelot Thwaytes, whose family bought the work for a reputed £140 in 1962 and kept it for almost half a century until its sale in 2006.

Renowned collector Sir Denis Mahon bought it at auction, where it was advertised as an imitator's version of Caravaggio's masterpiece The Cardsharps.

Legal battle: This 'copy' is at the centre of a costly High Court fight involving some of the world's leading Caravaggio experts after it sold for just £42,000 - before its buyer declared it was a £10million original

The real thing: The main version of Caravaggio's The Cardsharps, which hangs in the Kimbell Museum in Texas

After his purchase, Sir Denis declared it an early version by the artist himself - worth more than 200 times what he paid, according to papers filed at the High Court. 

Since the claim by Sir Denis, who died aged 100 three years ago, Mr Thwaytes has been building a hugely expensive legal case against the auction giant - which is resolutely standing by its experts.

Some of the world's most eminent Caravaggio scholars will give evidence at a High Court trial which started this morning.

As the trial opened, judge Mrs Justice Rose was taken through a 'spot the difference' exercise between the two pieces.

Henry Legge QC, representing Mr Thwaytes, said: 'It is easy when one is looking at these paintings to regard issues of attribution as a painting competition and we assume, naturally, that he was very good at painting.

'It is not merely a question of which painting is better, but distinguishing which painting shares characteristics of Caravaggio.

'It is easy to fall into the fallacy of thinking "it's a famous painter - it's painted well." That's not how attribution works.' 

Mr Thwaytes' claim said the painting was an early version by Caravaggio of his work The Cardsharps - one of his masterpieces.

The original hangs in the Kimbell Museum in Texas and shows a young man falling victim to a pair of cheats at a card game.

It is one of only 50 or so works by Caravaggio, one of the masters of his age, which survive to this day.

Mr Thwaytes claimed experts for Sotheby's did not consult widely enough before the sale of the painting - which is now hanging in the Museum of the Order of St John in London - in December 2006. He said that he only decided to sell the painting when he was told it was a 17th century copy.

In documents submitted to the High Court, Mr Thwaytes's lawyers criticised the auction house for negligence claiming they failed to carry out proper tests and consult experts.

In a skeleton argument they said: 'Sotheby's is responsible for all the foreseeable loss which is a consequence of Mr Thwaytes having acted on that advice.

'[The] evidence is that had the painting been sold at auction in 2006... it would have achieved £11m.

'However, a later sale by private treaty might have achieved a higher price than £11m.'

Mr Legge told the court: 'This case at its core is a very simple story.

'Mr Thwaytes had a picture which he thought might be by Caravaggio [so] he sent it to Sotheby's for research.

'Sotheby's looked at it and they told him that the painting wasn't by Caravaggio, but they hadn't done the tests that he had asked them to do.

'They came back to him and said they had done the X-rays on the painting and said it wasn't Caravaggio, but they didn't do infra-red imaging.

'When it was sold the new owner had it cleaned and submitted it to the tests, including infra-red and it was subsequently attributed to Caravaggio.

'At the core this is a negligence case, it is about Sotheby's actions and not attribution.'

When the Museum of the Order of St John acquired the work on loan earlier this year, it told journalists: 'In 2006, Sir Denis discovered another version of The Cardsharps, virtually identical to the Kimbell picture.

'After exhaustive study and scientific analysis, Sir Denis concluded that this was an earlier version, also painted for Cardinal del Monte.

'The attribution was also supported by other leading Caravaggio scholars, such as Mina Gregori, Maurizio Marini, Antonio Paolucci, Daniele Benati Thomas Schneider, and others.'

But Sotheby's is fiercely contesting the claim - and calling renowned experts to give evidence on their behalf.

They will include Caravaggio scholar Sir Richard Spear, who supports the auction house's stance.

The auction house said in its High Court statement, seen by MailOnline: 'The painting is not by Caravaggio and is clearly inferior in quality to the universally acknowledged original in the Kimbell Museum.

'There is a vast difference in quality between the Kimbell Cardsharps and the Painting at issue.

'The Kimbell Cardsharps was painted by Caravaggio with the striking virtuosity and realism for which his early works are famous. The quality of execution on display in the Painting falls far short of the Kimbell original.

'Our experts were entirely competent to make this assessment and even if they had carried out further investigation, this would just have confirmed their view that the painting is an anonymous copy.

'None of the leading scholars who have opined on the painting since Denis Mahon acquired it think that it is by Caravaggio.' 

The auction house claimed one of Mr Thwayte's experts is an 'administrator' who specialises in the Renaissance and not the Baroque period, while another two are 'restorers without qualifications in art history'.

'None of these individuals are "leading Caravaggio scholars''', the auction house said. 

The statement added Mr Thwaytes could have sought his own experts at the time of the sale.

Sotheby's claim that despite the painting now being regarded by some as a genuine Caravaggio, no leading expert has confirmed it as the master's work.

Mr Thwaytes could not be reached for comment. 

The hearing, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.
