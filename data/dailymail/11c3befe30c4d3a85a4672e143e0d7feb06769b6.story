The Indonesian victim of a shocking murder-suicide in Brisbane has finally been laid to rest.

The body of Mayang Prasetyo, 27, was discovered dismembered in her Brisbane apartment last month.

The transgender woman's Australian husband Marcus Volke, 27, fled the apartment when police arrived, and took his own life in a nearby industrial bin.

Ms Prasetyo, originally from Indonesia, has been laid to rest 

Parts of Ms Prasetyo's body were found strewn across the couple's new Teneriffe apartment

The mother of Ms Prasetyo says she has forgiven Volke for the murder of her daughter

Police say he had tried to dispose of Ms Mayang's remains by boiling them on the stove, in what they can only surmise was a domestic violence situation that got terribly out of hand.

Ms Mayang's mother Nining Sukarni said on Saturday it was a relief to finally lay her eldest child to rest.

She thanked both Australian and Indonesian authorities who made the repatriation to Bandar Lampung a smooth process.

'Everyone has been very helpful,' she told AAP.

'Friends, neighbours, even people from the related government offices. Many of them came to her funeral.'

It's understood identification issues delayed the release of Ms Mayang's body.

Volke's funeral was held in Victoria last month.

Then, Ms Nining said she was stunned the quiet, polite young man she had met was capable of such a crime, but that she was able to forgive him.

She says Volke's family has not contacted her since the deaths.

Volke also advertised on online escorting sites

Ms Mayang, who was born Febri Andriansyah, worked as an escort to support her family in Indonesia and put her two sisters through school.

Her friends have remembered her for this dedication to her family, as well as her fascination with celebrities and bubbly personality. 

The brothel owner who employed Ms Mayang praised the  'divine, beautiful, gentle' person who suffered at the hands of her abusive ice addict husband.

Mr Gneil laughed off claims that the couple met on a cruise ship and said they met at his brothel

Ms Prasetyo and her husband Marcus Volke were both employed as prostitutes at Ivan Gneil's Pleasure Dome brothel until 2012.

The owner claimed the other female staff were scared of Volke after he brought a gun to work. 

Mr Gneil told Daily Mail Australia he knew Ms Prasetyo for about five years, as he revealed how he heard Volke had become violent towards her. 

Volke worked at the Pleasure Dome as a male prostitute for around two and a half years before he and Ms Prasetyo both left to work privately in 2012

'Marcus was just your average sort of boy. Other girls here said he had started to become violent. He was asked to leave here and the reason, I believe, was because he brought a gun in,' Mr Gneil said.

The owner told how the managers at the brothel had expressed concerns that Volke had 'become a bit aggressive towards them before he was asked to leave'.

'He was known to be violent towards transsexuals when he was with them. Marcus was also definitely a drug user. He was on ice, we just don't tolerate it here,' Mr Gneil added.

The remains of Ms Prasetyo were found cooking inside a Teneriffe apartment - in Brisbane's inner-city - on Saturday night. 

Volke fled the scene when police showed up at the couple's home and was later found with his throat slashed and a knife in an industrial bin nearby.

'I'm truly shocked by the news, absolutely devastated. When you don't see anyone for a while (in this industry) you just assume they've gone overseas, so it was horrific to think what Mayang went through.

'I couldn't imagine anyone killing someone and chopping them up but I guess I should have seen it coming,' Mr Gneil said. 

Ms Prasetyo finished working at the brothel the day after Volke left. 

It was revealed Volke was a male prostitute and covered up his secret life by telling close friends and family he was a chef.

Speaking through an interpreter, Nining Sukarni - the mother of Ms Prasetyo - said  she had already forgiven her son-in-law.

'I have forgiven. I have no demands whatsoever or revengeful feeling. Because I love Marcus just like I love Maya,' she told The Courier Mail. 

Ms Sukarni said she had met Volke when the couple came to visit her at her Lampung home in rural Indonesia in 2013.

'They loved each other. We have already considered him as part of the family. I love him,' she said

Ms Sukarni described Ms Prasetyo - who her mother refers to as  Febri Andriansyah - as 'cheerful, friendly and loud' and a 'good son'.

She said when they came to visit in August last year Volke had cooked with Ms Prasetyo and the visit passed without incident.

'He was kind and loving, shy and reserved. In our eyes he was kind. I never suspected anything,' Ms Surkarni said. 

Queensland Police made the grisly discovery of a woman's body parts in Brisbane

Friends of the couple revealed the truth about Marcus Volke's double life to Daily Mail Australia and also criticised a Brisbane newspaper for its portrayal of victim Mayang Prasetyo.

Interior designer Alex Devantier, who knew the couple well, told Daily Mail Australia Volke had never worked as a chef but used it as a cover story to avoid telling his family and close friends the truth about his life as Heath the male prostitute.

In an online advertisement under the name Heath XL, Volke describeed himself as a 'young sexy Australian boy, very friendly and easy going'.

Ms Prasetyo's remains were found at an apartment on Commercial Road and Volke's body was found on Dath Street

The ad went onto to say: 'I can be your companion for an hour or as long as u want, for a dinner, a hot session, holidays or more'.  

Mr Devantier met Volke and Ms Prasetyo - who were married in Europe in August 2013 - four years ago in Melbourne and introduced them. 

'They both went into private escorting. I actually helped Marcus register as a private escort in Melbourne and then with his advertising.' 

Mr Devantier, from Townsville, said he was in shock over the tragedy.

'I still don't believe he [Volke] did it. I can't believe he did it. If he did do it, sometimes you can't judge it, you can't pick it,' Mr Devantier said.
