Scarface and Godfather actor Al Pacino is offering die-hard fans the chance to fly with him on a private jet – but it will set them back an eye-watering sum of £25,000 (or $41,500).

The unusual meet and greet is part of a ticket package offered by a Cambridge-based tour operator ahead of Pacino’s three-city speaking tour in the UK and Ireland.

But the 74-year-old actor, who has made millions over an illustrious career spanning six decades, is drawing criticism for the pricey promotion.

Die-hard fans of actor Al Pacino can fly on a private jet with him from Glasgow to London for £25,000 

Event Travel, which is offering the five-figure ticket package, declined to say whether anyone has paid for a spot on the private jet, which will fly from Glasgow to London.

Most commercial flights on the same route last roughly 80 minutes.

According to an online itinerary, the package includes a commercial flight ticket from any UK airport to Glasgow, plus a ticket to Pacino’s show in the Scottish city on May 19.

The VIP package, priced from £25,000 or $41,555 per person, includes: 

Up to two hardcore fans will then fly from Glasgow to London with Pacino on his entourage after the show, giving them the perfect opportunity to corner the actor and question about his roles as Tony Montana in the cult film Scarface, Michael Corleone in The Godfather trilogy, or his Academy Award-winning performance in Scent of a Woman.

Dubbed ‘The Amazing Experience’, it also includes three nights in a five-star hotel in London, transfers and a ticket to the actor’s May 22 show at the Hammersmith Apollo.

Pacino fans who find the price too steep can opt for ‘The Unique Experience’, which allows them to eat lunch with the actor at his hotel before the London show, for £7,500 ($12,000).

If that is too pricey, fans can buy a £2,500 ($4,150) ticket package that includes about 20 minutes of alone time with Pacino in his dressing room, or they can spend £650 ($1,080) for a group meet and greet.

The speaking series, ‘An Evening with Pacino’, is being marketed as ‘an exceptional opportunity to catch an icon in the flesh’.

Organisers are promising never-before-heard stories and never-before-seen video clips, plus a chance to ask questions.

It follows a sold-out event at the Palladium in 2013.
