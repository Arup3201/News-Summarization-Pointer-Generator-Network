Popular Australian label sass & bide returned to British turf on Friday night - and all eyes were on creative director Anthony Cuthbertson as he made his design debut. 

Taking over from former founders and designers, Sarah-Jane Clarke and Heidi Middleton, Cuthbertson - whose CV includes consulting work for Victoria Beckham and Mulberry - certainly had big shoes to fill.

The AW15 collection, Mojo-Kico, was rebellious and effervescent - and proved that Cuthbertson can design with aplomb.

Australian fashion favourite sass & bide's AW15 collection was bold and fresh thanks to new creative director, Anthony Cuthbertson 

Since taking over the design helm, it's clear that Cuthbertson has stayed true to the classic appeal of the brand but injected his own touch.

Thanks to Cuthbertson, the AW15 collection's aesthetic has wandered toward an urban, tribal theme (just look to the gold mirrored-perspex embellishments fitted like armor-wear for evidence).

Sweeping pleated skirts, floating capes and fringe detailing added a much-needed fluidity to the otherwise structured silhouette, creating an unruly, edgy presence as each model sauntered by. 

From silver struck elements to golden embroidered dresses and coats, sass & bide was targeting the urban warrior.  

Sequined pieces broke up the almost exclusively black and white colour scheme, whilst staying within the realms of rock 'n' roll glamour. 

Silver and gold metallics were incorporated into casual pieces making a subtle appearance in daywear, where they were paired with soft knitwear and the softest of furs.  

Cuthbertson has clearly moved the label’s focus from evening to the everyday and by bringing the show back to London, he'd succeeded in his vision  to pay tribute to the founders of the label - and wouldn't they be proud.
