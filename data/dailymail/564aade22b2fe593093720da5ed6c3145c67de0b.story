Three rocky outcrops, the size of kitchen tables, could be worth billions of dollars to the West Australian government.

The three rocks, which are barely one metre above sea level and three metres long, were discovered by Geoscience Australia during a satellite sweep of the area.

Since they are naturally forming and sit 'above ordinary high water', they have been classified as 'islands', prompting a redrawing of West Australia's maritime boundaries.

The tiny outcrops sit directly above the Torosa gas field, which makes up more than half of the multibillion dollar Borse offshore petroleum project and mean the state government's share of Torosa may increase from 5 percent to up to 65.5 percent.

The outcrops are part of the North Scott Reef, 300km north-west of Cape Leveque on the north coast of Western Australia.

Geoscience Australia shared news of the discovery with other agencies last week after they realised the huge ramifications of the discovery, reported the West Australian.

A spokesman for West Australian Mining Minister Bill Marmion said the state government were notified of the find on Wednesday.

'It will means billions of dollars for the state,' he said.

The redrawing of the boundaries has not yet been ratified, but West Australian Mining Minister Bill Marmion said the discovery was 'very exciting and potentially a great windfall for the state.'

'We're now working closely with the Federal Government to determine Western Australia's share of the Browse field and it's exact implications.

'WA will work cooperatively with the Commonwealth and the Joint Venture partners to the bring the project into production,' said Mr Marmion.

The proposed boundary changes could affect up to seven of the 13 gas fields in the area.

The Browse LNG project is one of the country's largest oil and gas developments.

Mr Marmion told the ABC that this discovery will probably not have any effect on whether the gas will be processed onshore at James Price Point.

WA Premier Colin Barnett has advocated for gas to be processed onshore at James Price Point north of Broome, sparking widespread protests on the grounds that the site is culturally and environmentally significant.

Woodside refused that option, saying it was not financially viable and it prefers floating liquefied gas technology.

Mr Marmion told the ABC: 'The premier has actually said that for this particular project floating LNG is probably already organised.'

James Price Point was the proposed location of the on-shore gas processing plant, though the gas will now be processed off-shore on floating platforms
