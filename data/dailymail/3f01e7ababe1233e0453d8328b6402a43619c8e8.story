James Houghton, 19, (pictured) was at Leeds Festival  when he collapsed and died after taking ecstasy tablets

A former school prefect with a 'fabulous mind' died of an ecstasy overdose at a music festival last year, an inquest has heard.

James Houghton, 19, from Hartlepool, County Durham, had travelled to Leeds Festival with a group of friends in August last year - just a month before he was due to start studying history at Manchester University.

The student was seen stumbling while waiting to watch Eminem at the festival at Bramham Park, Wetherby, West Yorkshire, before he left the crowd and suffered a seizure near a burger van.

After being rushed to the festival site's medical centre by ambulance, he went into cardiac arrest - and despite attempts to revive him, Mr Houghton was pronounced dead at 11.30pm on Sunday August 25.

Friends of the teenager told security staff that he had taken three ecstasy tablets.

Dr Lisa Barker, a consultant histopathologist at St James's Hospital in Leeds said that results of toxicology reports showed Mr Houghton had taken a fatal level of ecstasy.

Dr Barker told an inquest into his death that there were also traces of amphetamine and cocaine in his system.

She said high levels of ecstasy can cause convulsions and cardiac arrhythmia - where the heart beats abnormally.

West Yorkshire Coroner David Hinchliff recorded a verdict that Mr Houghton's death was drug related,

He said: 'There is no doubt at all that he either had drugs with him, or will have acquired some while he was there and he had been known to be consuming recreational drugs over the course of that weekend.'

Mr Houghton's mother Paula said in a statement: 'He had a fabulous mind and cared passionately about his friends and family.'
