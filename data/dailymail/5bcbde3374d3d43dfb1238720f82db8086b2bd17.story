Sir Alex Ferguson earned a staggering £2,165,000 from Manchester United between October 2013 and June last year in his role as £100,000-a-day ‘global ambassador’ for the club.

The figure, first revealed by Sportsmail, is officially declared in club accounts recently lodged at Companies House and confirms the 73-year-old Scot’s long association with United remains highly lucrative for him.

The same accounts show Sir Bobby Charlton was also paid by United in 2013-14 for ‘consultancy services’, although he made just £105,000.

Ferguson ended his 26-year managerial association with the club two years ago but has reaped the rewards of such a successful spell as boss.

United have always understood the Scot’s immense value as a global figure in terms of their ever-expanding commercial operation.

David Moyes' pay-off was revealed to be £4.89m in the club's annual accounts, logged recently

United have also confirmed that the pay-off for David Moyes and his staff was £4,892,000.

Moyes was sacked after just eight months in charge after succeeding Ferguson – the lack of Champions League football this season key in the decision to part ways.

Phil Neville – brought in from Everton by Moyes – also left at the end of last season and took up a punditry job at the BBC.

Jimmy Lumsden and Steve Round, both allies of the now Real Sociedad manager, were also given their marching orders by the club.
