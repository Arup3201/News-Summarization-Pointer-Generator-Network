A television commercial starring Pamela Anderson and a lesser-known actress exposing their bras and cleavages has been banned as sexist and degrading to women.

The 45-year-old Baywatch star and her assistant Vanessa are shown in an office boardroom full of businessmen in the banned advert for  domain and web hosting company Dreamscape Networks. 

While the assistant pours coffee and cream, her cleavage is revealed to one of the men, Adam, who then fantasises about the pair dancing in bikinis.

The Advertising Standards Authority has banned an advert featuring Baywatch star Pamela Anderson for being sexist and degrading to women

The advert features Pamela Anderson and her 'assistant' dancing in bikinis while 'writhing around in cream'

Advertising watchdogs upheld complaints from four viewers.

The Advertising Standards Authority said it realised the advert - which had a timing restriction for screening after 9pm - was intended as a parody of a mundane business meeting and that the women were portraying dynamic businesswomen.

But it said: 'We considered that they were also portrayed sexually throughout the ad - not just during the fantasy sequence.

'We noted that, even though they were wearing business attire, their shirts were buttoned down so that they were exposing their bras and cleavages.

'Furthermore, during the fantasy sequence, they were seen dancing and writhing around in cream whilst wearing bikinis.

'Although the fantasy scene, which we considered was sexually suggestive, was limited to Adam's imagination, we considered it gave the impression that he viewed his female colleagues as sexual objects to be lusted after.

The watchdog said the advert gave the impression Adam 'viewed his female colleagues as sexual objects to be lusted after'

'Because of that, we considered the ad was likely to cause serious offence to some viewers on the basis that it was sexist and degrading to women.'

The industry watchdog said the advert must not be broadcast again in its current form.

The London-based company said it did not believe the advert was offensive or degraded women.

A spokesman said: 'We did not believe the ad objectified women, as it was clear the exaggerated fantasy sequence was limited to Adam's imagination.

'It was his musings and easy distraction which were meant to be over-the-top and comical - especially in the context of a business meeting and because they were suddenly interrupted.

'It was a tongue-in-cheek approach to promoting our product. We believed the majority of viewers would find the ad fanciful and humorous.'
