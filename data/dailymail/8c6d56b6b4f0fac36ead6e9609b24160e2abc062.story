Vladimir Putin today issued a Cold War-style tirade to Western leaders warning them not to 'blackmail' major nuclear power Russia.

Ahead of a key summit showdown with European leaders including David Cameron, he also threatened to shut of gas supplies to the EU this winter.

The tough-talking former KGB spy took aim at a 'hostile' Barack Obama who listed 'Russian aggression' in Ukraine among the top global threats alongside Islamic State jihadists and Ebola.

He lambasted Western sanctions now hitting his struggling economy, accusing the US and EU of an 'absurd, illusory goal' in seeking to isolate Moscow.

'We are hoping our partners will understand the recklessness of attempts to blackmail Russia, (and) remember what discord between large nuclear powers can do to strategic stability,' warned the Kremlin strongman.

If pro-Western but energy-starved Kiev siphons gas from a pipe carrying supplies to the EU this winter, then Moscow would cut supplies, warned Putin, after receiving a red carpet welcome in Serbian capital Belgrade.

'If we see that our Ukrainian partners begin unsanctioned siphoning of gas from the pipeline system aimed for export, we will also cut the flow for the amount of stolen gas,' he said.

He warned of 'major transit risks'.

Cameron is taking part in a key summit in Milan tomorrow which will see Putin hold make-or-break talks with his Ukrainian opposite number Petro Poroshenko.

But last night Angel Merkel warned Putin that an enforceable ceasefire this winter depended on urgent action from Russia.

Fearing the conflict could escalate, Ukraine announced it has dug a 39-mile anti tank ditch and 30 miles of other defences on a key section of its border to discourage Putin from sending his forces into its territory.

Meanwhile, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev expressed fear of a damaging return to the Cold War. He urged both the West and Putin to pull back from the brink.

'As a first step, the logic of mutual accusations and sanctions must be left behind,' the 83-year-old told Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper, the Kremlin's official organ.

'One must not get dragged back into a new Cold War. Shared threats to our security have not disappeared.'

The elder statesman demanded the leaders concentrate on critical global threats such as the Ebola virus and the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq and Syria.

'In the face of shared challenges, we can again find a common language,' he said.

'It won't be easy but there is no other way.'

But Moscow denied it had agreed to share intelligence on the IS with America.
