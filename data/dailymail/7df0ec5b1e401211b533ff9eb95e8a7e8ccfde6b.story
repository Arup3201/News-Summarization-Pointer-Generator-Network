Instagram is the most depressing social network and even worse than Facebook, according to a U.S magazine.

Jessica Winter from Slate claims that Instagram takes the parts of Facebook that make people feel depressed and unsatisfied with their lot, such as looking at other people's photos and friend's broadcasting how great their lives are, and accentuates them.

This then creates feelings of intense jealousy and also crosses the 'grey line of stalkerism'.

A journalist for U.S magazine Slate puts forward the idea that Instagram is the most depressing social network, and is worse than Facebook and Twitter for people bragging, posting smug photos and creating feelings of jealousy

Winter claims Instagram is depressing because it is photo-led. Photos are the most explicit way for people to show off

In her article, Winter speaks to communications and psychology professors that have previously written studies on the effects of Facebook in a bid to bolster her claims.

The first reason why Winter believes Instagram is so depressing is that it 'purifies' the three worst aspects of Facebook associated with causing envy.

She names this as scrolling through hundreds of other people's photos - including strangers' - liking images and seeking likes and approval from peers, and announcing to millions of people how great their lives are.

Winter claims that Instagram takes these traits and amplifies them.

She adds this is because the site is picture-led and photos are the easiest way for people to show off because they provide an isolated snapshot in time.

Hanna Krasnova of Humboldt University Berlin told Winter: 'You get more explicit and implicit cues of people being happy, rich, and successful from a photo than from a status update.

She continues: 'If you see beautiful photos of your friend on Instagram, one way to compensate is to self-present with even better photos, and then your friend sees your photos and posts even better photos, and so on.

'Self-promotion triggers more self-promotion, and the world on social media gets further and further from reality.'

Instagram photos also cross the 'grey line of stalkerism', according to Winter. This is because it's easier to strike up a conversation about a shared article on Facebook, for example, without it seeming too personal. However, if someone tells a stranger they've looked through their photos, it can seem intrusive

Viewers also don't know what else is happening around the image. For example, a couple on holiday could be posting beautiful images while arguing the whole time.

Winter believes this gives a 
distorted view of the person posting the photo's world, which in turn 
distorts the viewers' opinion of their own lives. It leads people to think their life isn't fulfilling enough and makes them feel depressed.

She adds that the more someone does this, the more distorted their view becomes and the less meaningful their life feels.

Winter continues that as well as making people feel depressed, Instagram also crosses the 'grey line of stalkerism.'

She uses the example of a science article being posted on Facebook compared to a honeymoon photo being uploaded to Instagram.

Winter explains that if a friend posts a science article on Facebook, it's easier to strike up a conversation about the article without it seeming too personal.

However, if someone tells a friend, or even someone they don't know, that they've looked through their honeymoon photos, it can seem personal and intrusive - even if the photos were shared publicly.

Facebook can make you feel socially 
isolated and miserable because seeing friends' happy pictures triggers 
feelings of envy, according to experts from Berlin's Humboldt University
and Darmstadt's Technical University.

They claim one in three people feel 
worse after visiting the site and that their 'general dissatisfaction' 
with life had increased.

The German researchers studied 600 
people and found that those who browsed without contributing were more 
likely to feel bad afterwards.

Positive images of friends enjoying 
holidays, commenting on their happy lives or simply posting pet pictures
was enough to trigger feelings of jealousy,

The Facebook test group said what 
riled them most were happy holiday snaps of 'Facebook friends' followed 
by gushing prose of fabulous lives, great jobs and cracking social 
diaries.

The academics added people who surfed a lot on such sites were in danger of becoming socially isolated and depressed.
