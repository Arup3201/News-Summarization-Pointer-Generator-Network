Dolphins in a popular Australian resort have been spotted giving presents to human visitors.

Researchers revealed the astonishing find in a new research paper analysing the animals at the Tangalooma Island Resort in Australia.

On 23 occasions over the past several years, wild dolphins were observed
giving gifts to humans, including eels, tuna, squid, and even an octopus.

'Gift giving has become an established but infrequent part of the culture of the provisioned dolphins at Tangalooma,' the researchers say in a paper pushed in 
the journal Anthrozoös: A Multidisciplinary Journal of the Interactions 
of People & Animals.

The wild dolphins that were observed giving gifts to human in Australia 
were regular visitors to a provisioning program at the Tangalooma Island
Resort which began in 1992.

Each evening 
staff members from the resort wade into the ocean to feed the wild 
dolphins fish.

In 1998, an adult male dolphin named Fred was observed giving a dead 
moray eel to one of the staff members.

Since then, staff members have 
documented an additional 22 other events.

'Since July 1998, biologists managing the program have documented 23 occurrences of 'giftgiving,' when several of the provisioned dolphins have offered wild-caught cephalopod or fin fish species to staff members,' the researchers wrote.

Dolphins of a wide group of ages and both sexes engaged in the gift-giving 
behavior, and scientists are not entirely sure of what is motivating 
their behavior.

Food sharing in animals is often motivated by an urge to
play, a desire to reciprocate food sharing or the belief that the 
recipient of the food is an incompetent hunter, they claim.

Based on their detailed 
observations, the scientists think that gift giving among the wild 
dolphins at the Tangalooma Island Resort was likely a form of play 
behavior.

'Gift giving may occur either as a discreet behavior (that may be a sequel to one or more other behaviors such as play or food preparation), or as a part of other behaviors, such as play and/or food sharing,' the team, Bonnie Holmes and David Neil of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, said.

'It is most likely a  manifestation of the particular relationship between the provisioned dolphinsand the human participants in the provisioning.

'Gift giving has become an established but infrequent part of the culture of the provisioned dolphins at Tangalooma.'

The resort is well known for its dolphin encounters, where the wild animals come to the beach.
