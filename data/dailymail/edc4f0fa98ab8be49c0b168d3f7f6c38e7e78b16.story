The Mayor of London swapped Kalashnikovs for cups of tea today as his visit to Iraq continued into its second day.

Boris Johnson, whose trip to the Kurdish border was prompted by security concerns in London, was seen meeting locals, playing with children and chatting with officials over cups of tea.

Mr Johnson was yesterday pictured wielding an assault rifle as he met Peshmerga fighters and today called on the British Government to supply them with more sophisticated weaponry.

Yesterday Mr Johnson was pictured laying side-by-side in the mud with Peshmerga fighters, joining them in their shooting practice near the Kurdish capital Erbil in Iraq.

Trying to look the part once more, the Mayor of London donned a traditional head-dress as he chatted with officials - but gave away his British identity by sipping on a cup of tea. 

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, the Mayor of London urged the Government to supply more sophisticated weaponry to the fighters, who are battling ISIS in northern Iraq.

He said: 'They are incredibly pro-British. These guys really are in the front line. The Peshmerga are the guys who are taking on the terrorists.

'I was watching some footage of a huge battle where they were using a lot of German-made equipment to take out about 17 suicide bomb vehicles.

'You wonder what it is that is preventing us from giving them that kind of weaponry ourselves.

'I think the nervousness is that the Government hasn't worked out in its own mind whether it wants to see an independent sovereign Kurdistan.

'There is an anxiety that if too many weapons are put into the hands of the Peshmerga, then in what context might they ultimately be used.'

Despite the serious trade talks with officials in Kurdistan, Mr Johnson had time to try on the local headgear

The main focus of Mr Johnson's visit, made at the invitation of Kurdish prime minister Nechirvan Barzani, has been to boost trade links with the Kurdistan region

His comments come after Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned that it could be months before the regular Iraqi forces are ready to mount a sustained offensive against ISIS.

British military personnel in Kurdistan are training the region's Peshmerga forces, who have been involved in some of the heaviest fighting against the terrorists. 

The main focus of Mr Johnson's visit, made at the invitation of Kurdish prime minister Nechirvan Barzani, has been to boost trade links with the Kurdistan region.

Mr Johnson said yesterday: 'Over the last decade Kurdistan region has seen considerable economic growth and social development, and I'm here to mark London's role as an active ally in this.' 

He added: 'We have a mutual interest in not only Kurdistan region's security and prosperity but that of Iraq as a whole.

'The links between Britain and the Kurdistan region are developing at an incredible pace, there is a dynamic and forward looking leadership here and I am looking forward to rolling up our sleeves and discussing greater cooperation on a range of issues.'

The mayor was accompanied on the visit by the British consul general to Kurdistan Angus McKee and Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi, who was born to Kurdish parents in Iraq and retains close links with the region.
