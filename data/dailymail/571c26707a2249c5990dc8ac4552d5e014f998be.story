They call him PicASHo - because his bizarre work incorporates his dead subjects' ashes into his artwork.

And he's certainly proved popular.

Artist Adam Brown has cut out a rather odd niche in the art world by turn his customers' ashes, or the ashes of a loved one, into paintings.

Among the bizarre requests he's had are paintings of a customer's favourite fishing spots, animals, flowers and even Albert Einstein.

Artist Adam Browns receives daily requests from people wishing for either their ashes, or the ashes of others, to be turned into paintings.

At work: Mr Brown, from Grandview in Missouri, came across the unique concept while watching a TV show

Mr Brown, from Grandview, in Missouri, 
was approached by a friend of a friend, who asked if he could create a 
memorial portrait of a loved one - and he suggested painting it with 
their ashes.

Though initially nervous, Mr Brown, 32, said that he found handling the human remains quite natural.

The artist only requests a small amount of the cremated remains, which he then mixes into certain areas of a portrait.

He works off a photograph provided by either the deceased's friend, relative or loved one, and asks for their input throughout the process.

Mr Brown said that each work takes him between four and eight hours to complete, and that as well as mixing the ashes into the paint, he also adds some to the surface of the portrait, using special glues and resin.

The artist marks the back of every portrait to state that the work was created using some human remains - just in case if falls into the hands of someone who is unaware of his methods.

The artist has said some people find his work 'sick' or 'creepy', but he says his customers are pleased

Mr Brown, whose collection is called 'Ashes to Art,' now receives requests from people everyday.

The artist, who believes the majority of people do not find his work creepy or weird, said: 'A friend of a friend in another state asked me to do a memorial portrait of her recently deceased husband.

'After agreeing to it, as I had done before, she asked if I could use the cremation remains in the work - something she believed he would have liked. Tentatively, I said that would be fine.

Not all the work Mr Brown does is of dead people, here is a painting he created of a woman

'I thought I'd have an odd reaction to handling human remains the first time, but it wasn't strange at all. It was just another medium to work in. I wore gloves, handled them respectfully, adhered them to the surface of the painting, and sent the unused portion back.'

'The majority of people seem to really love the idea and have expressed interest in getting one for a loved one or even having one made for themselves when they pass away.

'I've even had elderly people contact me to arrange this service for themselves when they pass. But I also had one girl on Facebook who compared me to Hitler - although others commenting on the thread were quick to correct her.

'For those that find it "sick" or "creepy", I just tell them they don't have to purchase one. For everyone else, they are truly touched by the unique service.

'I always say, "Having ashes in an urn on the fireplace is a good way to constantly remember that someone died. Using their remains to create a beautiful piece of art is a great way to remember that they lived."'
