The number of people having to submit tax returns has soared to a record high of 10.7million thanks to the Government’s controversial changes to child benefit.

For the first time, hundreds of thousands of parents who have never had to fill in a self-assessment tax form have been caught in a system that many struggle to understand.

HMRC warned nearly 100,000 parents are at
 risk of a fine of 100 per cent of the amount of child benefit that they
 have received but are no longer entitled to keep.

HM Revenue and Customs said record numbers of parents are being forced to fill in a tax return every year

For a parent with three children, this could result in a fine of up to £612, or £438 if they have two children or £263 for parents with one child.

In January last year, around 1.1million parents lost all or some of their eligibility for child benefit after the Government controversially changed the rules.

If one or both parents earn more than £60,000, they lost the benefit entirely, while those earning more than £50,000 and up to £60,000 lost some of the benefit on a sliding scale.

If they have continued to receive the benefit - which they are allowed to do - they must pay back the amount of money that they are no longer eligible to receive through self-assessment.

HMRC said around 461,000 parents opted to stop receiving child benefit while others have registered, or were already registered, for self-assessment.

But there are still 'just below 100,000' parents who are yet to register for self-assessment, an HMRC spokesman said yesterday.

The deadline for filing their tax return for the 2012/2013 tax year to repay their child benefit was Friday 31 January.

They will not be fined the standard £100 penalty for missing the deadline, but will instead be hit by a 'failure to notify' penalty because they have not registered for self-assessment.

Parents should have paid back the amount that they received between 7 January 2013 - when the rules were changed - and 5 April 2013 - the last day of the tax year.

Robin Williamson, from the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said HMRC had chosen a 'complicated and odd' way of clawing back the money from parents.

He called for HMRC to show leniency towards parents, many of whom will be confused by the new system or not even aware of it.

Mr Williamson said: 'I think it would be inappropriate for HMRC to levy the full penalties in this first year until people have really got their head around the situation.' HMRC said it will be writing to all of the 100,000 parents to warn them of the urgent need to complete their tax return.

The quicker they register for self-assessment, the less likely they are to be hit by a 'failure to notify' penalty, HMRC said.

There were 30 million taxpayers in 2012/2013. HMRC said 10.03million people filed a tax return before deadline day of a total of 10.74million who need to complete one.

The busiest time was on deadline day when 569,847 people filed their tax return, but 1,566 also found the time on Christmas Day to send an online tax return.

The number of people who have to complete a tax return has been increasing rapidly, rising by around 1.4million since the 2006/07 tax year.

In a sign of the rise of the internet, just 38,000 filed their tax return online in 2001, compared to 8.5million for the most recent tax year.

A tax return must be completed by people who owe money to the tax man, typically the self-employed and those with additional earnings or income on top of their main job.
