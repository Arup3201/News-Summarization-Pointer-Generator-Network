Connor Smith, 19, suffered fatal multiple injuries after falling from his quad during the race

A British quad bike rider has been killed in a horrific accident during a competition in Italy.

Connor Smith, 19, suffered fatal multiple injuries after falling from his quad and then being hit several times by other riders in the race.

Paramedics were immediately on the scene and the event was stopped as emergency crews battled to save his life and he was taken to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead.

Connor was killed in the first race of the European Quad of Nations championships which were being held in Cingoli near Ancona, in Central Italy.

He had arrived at the weekend event race event last Friday with team mates Paul Holmes and Luke Cooper and they had been among the favourites to win.

Because of funding only a small team had been entered in the race and earlier this month an appeal had gone out for sponsorships via quad bike websites.

Besides Connor, an Italian rider Filippo Rondinini, 27, was also injured in the pile up and he was taken to hospital but his condition was not described as serious.

Officials cancelled the event as soon as the teenager's death was confirmed and a minute's silence was held in memory of the rider, who was thought to be from Scotland.

An entry on the Facebook page of Quad Scotland read: 'Connor Smith RIP

'Deeply saddened and shocked to learn today of the tragic loss of Connor Smith, our 2013 Champion; a great friend, committed competitor and huge inspiration to quad riders young and old, in Scotland and beyond.

The teenager was competing as part of the British team at the event which was held in Cingoli near Ancona, in Central Italy

'He achieved so much in his short life, and had so much still to give. Our thoughts and sympathies go to Bill, Jackie, family and friends.'

An ambulance spokesman in Cingoli said: 'We tried what we could to save the British rider's life but there was nothing we could do. He had suffered serious injuries after falling off and then being hit by other riders.

A tribute to Connor described him as 'a great friend, committed competitor and huge inspiration to quad riders young and old'

'Attempts were made to save his life at the scene and he was then rushed to a nearby hospital but he died from his injuries.'

Two other riders were also injured on Saturday but their condition was not serious and they were treated at the Torrette di Ancona hospital.

After the death was announced to the crowd a message was read out from his father which said: 'My son Connor died taking part in a sport he lived. He was representing the colours of his nation.'

As the message was read out fans applauded and fellow riders gathered at the spot where the accident died to hold a prayer vigil before the race was cancelled.

A tribute was also posted on the website of the Italian Quad Bike Federation which read: 'There are no words to describe the state of our souls.

'All the staff, riders, managers and officials from the Italian Quad Bike Federation unite in giving their condolences to the family of Connor Smith, who we are united with in grief and pain.'

A police spokesman said they were investigating the accident to establish whether all safety procedures had been implemented and to decide whether anyone should face criminal charges if they were breached.
