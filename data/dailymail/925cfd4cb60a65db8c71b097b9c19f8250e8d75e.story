Rickrolled: A teenager crashed Twitter's video app Vine by uploading a Rick Astley (pictured) music video

A 16-year-old computer whizz-kid managed to crash the Android version of Twitter's video-sharing app Vine on the day of its release by uploading a Rick Astley music video.

Will Smidlein, who lives just outside Cleveland, Ohio, sabotaged the app by rewriting computer code that prevents users from uploading videos more than six seconds long.

The cheeky teenager chose the Rick Astley clip which is used in a widespread online joke known as Rickrolling, where internet users are unwittingly redirected to a web page playing the video.

Smidlein immediately took to Twitter posting: 'I think I just broke Vine', before adding: 'I truly feel awful for the engineers whose day I ruined with my stupid messing around.'

The young prankster , who said he has been programming for a few years, said it had taken him less than an hour to rewrite the application.Â 

He only found out that it was successful, when someone retweeted the video which he'd posted from his account.

He told WKYC.com: 'I noticed something a little funny about how they were doing uploads a little different than how most do.

'I actually reverse engineered how that app works. I figured out how the app talks to the server.

Oops: The prankster immediately took to Twitter to apologise

'I did the RickRoll and within a couple minutes, I had a friend of a friend who works at Twitter engineering contact me and nicely asked me if I could take it down because it's kind of embarrassing.

'I was mortified because I was afraid that the engineers would be called out looking kind of silly.'

Smidlein later apologised to Twitter engineers for the trouble he caused but when asked if he might perform another RickRoll, he refused to rule it out.
