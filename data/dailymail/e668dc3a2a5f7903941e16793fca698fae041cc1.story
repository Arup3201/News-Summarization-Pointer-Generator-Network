It plunges 586ft underground - twice the height of the Statue of Liberty - and the interior has been described as 'pitch black'.

But these adventurers have descended into Fantastic Pit in Ellison's Cave, Georgia, famed as the deepest pit in America.

Intrepid explorer Amy Hinkle and a group including Shane Streetman and Elliot Hellman tackled the pit  last month and were able to produce a stunning set of photographs from their challenge.

Fantastic Pit in Ellison's Cave, Georgia, USA, is 586ft deep - almost twice the height of the Statue of Liberty

The climb is strictly for the experienced, and the equipment as well as the training for the descent has to be of the highest standard

The pit is part of a 12-mile-long underground system, has been on the bucket list of the explorers for some time

Amy revealed the pit, which is part of a 12-mile-long underground system, has been on her bucket list for some time.

In order to capture her spectacular shots she carries a lightweight camera kit and travels with a lighting assistant, Brian Stoltz.

Amy, 28, from Huntsville, Alabama, said: 'I've been doing this for quite a few years now so the depth doesn't bother me as much.

'I just think to myself 'yes, that's a deep pitch-black hole in the floor'.

Fantastic Pit, that is taken on as a challenge by many thrill-seekers, is almost twice as high as the Statue of Liberty

One of the group, Amy Hinkle, insists if proper training is done, 'caving is a relatively safe sport'

'We communicate via radio so I can direct the lighting for the shot.

'Caving is a relatively safe sport if it is done with proper training, gear and experience.'

Also in the area is Incredible Pit, the second deepest pit in the US at 440ft.

Due to the technical and dangerous nature of Ellison's Cave, it is generally explored by only the most experienced and capable cavers. 

Beginning cavers  are severely discouraged from entering and negotiating the cave. 

There have been a number of deaths, largely due to hypothermia, on various climbs in Ellison Cave

The vertical sections of the cave require extensive knowledge and practice of single rope technique climbing, including practice on heavy ropes and in wet environments.

There have sadly been a number of fatalities concerning Ellison Cave.

On March 10, 1999, a caver climbing the Incredible pit became tangled in multiple ropes and was stranded 140 feet off the cave floor underneath water falling into the pit. The incident resulted in fatality due to hypothermia.

The entrance to the pit is very deceiving, and you wouldn't believe it hides an underground world

Then on February 12, 2011 two University of Florida students died of hypothermia after becoming stuck on rope near a waterfall close to the bottom of a 120 foot pit.

On May 26, 2013 a caver was rescued and hospitalized after falling 40 feet in the cave. It took 21 hours to evacuate the caver, including hauling up Fantastic Pit.
