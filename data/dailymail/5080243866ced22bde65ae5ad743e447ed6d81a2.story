An 11-year-old girl with leukaemia has been reportedly taken to Mexico by her parents because they believe her life was in danger at the Phoenix hospital where she was being treated.

Emily Bracamontes had
been receiving chemotherapy at Phoenix Children's Hospital for a month when her mother Norma removed an IV drip from her arm, changed her clothes and walked her out of the facility last Wednesday night.

The parents said they took their daughter to Mexico because they believe she was 'threatened and intimidated' at the Arizona hospital and had contracted an infection while there which led to her arm being amputated.

Concern: The father of 11-year-old Emily Bracamontes shows a picture of her in a hospital bed in Mexico

On the move: Leukemia patient Emily is seen with her mother on Phoenix Children's Hospital CCTV last Wednesday shortly before she disappeared

Mr Bracamontes, showing a cellphone picture of Emily in a Mexican hospital bed, told NBC: 'They [doctors] told my wife that she already had it [the infection]. That’s not true. Her arm was healthy.'

Phoenix Children's Hospital could not discuss the family's concerns directly because of federal confidentiality law but released a statement on Monday urging the Bracamontes to contact them to talk about Emily's health and
treatment options.

While Mr Bracamontes was being interviewed, he called Emily to ask her how she was feeling, to which she answered 'good'.

The Hispanic girl also had a catheter 
placed in her heart at Phoenix Children's Hospital - which doctor's now believe could 
cause a deadly infection if she is not returned to have it removed. 

Following Emily's disappearance, Phoenix Police's Steve Martos said: 'If she contracts an infection, it really could just be a
matter of days that could result in the young girl's death. It's
pretty serious.'

Camera footage shows Mrs Bracamontes, 35,
pushing an IV stand through the hospital's hallways while her daughter, 
whose bandaged arm is visible, can be seen following her.

'Kidnapper': Luis Bracamontes speaks from Mexico this week after he and wife Norma removed daughter Emily from an Arizona hospital because they believed her life was in danger

Battling illness: Emily Bracamontes, pictured in hospital in the U.S., is now being cared for by doctors in Mexico, her father said this week

Mrs Bracamontes and Emily are U.S. citizens while Mr Bracamontes, 46, is a Mexican citizen with a U.S. resident alien identification card.

Mrs Bracamontes said she had no choice but to take her daughter from the hospital because her husband's insurance is running out. Mr Bracamontes said Phoenix Hospital was putting pressure on the family over rising medical bills.

The couple have not been charged with a crime so far but police said charges were still possible for negligence or abuse.

United States Customs and Border Patrol Officers stopped Luis Bracamontes as he tried to cross into America from Mexico on Saturday.

The man was quizzed about the whereabouts of his daughter Emily, but denied any involvement in her disappearance.

Police said that Mr Bracamontes was not driving the same black Ford van in which Emily left the hospital in when they stopped him.

They have described the family
as 'nomadic' and without a
permanent residence, but said they have relatives in Arizona, California
and Mexico.

Concerns: Doctors are worried Emily could die from an infection of the heart if the catheter is not medically removed
