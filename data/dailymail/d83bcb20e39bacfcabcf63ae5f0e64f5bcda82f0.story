A two-year-old California boy has died after being hit by a pick-up truck while he played in the street outside his house as one of his parents watched on in horror.

Keanu Vang was playing in a foot-propelled toy car with siblings on Sunday afternoon when he rolled onto the road at Hempstead Way in Stockton.

A driver in a white Chevy pickup traveling on Truesdale Place turned onto Hempstead Way and ran over the child, who he did not see.

The driver stopped immediately and is cooperating with police.

'My heart breaks for the baby and the family. It's sad. It’s really sad,' neighbor Alice Perez rold WBLX.

Perez said many in the neighborhood had been pushing for a stop sign to be installed at the corner where the accident occurred.

'That’s what we talk about all the time. That there’s no stop and traffic here is crazy,' she said.

'This whole neighborhood is full of children, so in one split second anything can happen.'
