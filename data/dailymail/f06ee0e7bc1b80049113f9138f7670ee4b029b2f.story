Tony Booth, the actor and father of Cherie Blair has been battling Alzheimer’s disease for nearly a decade, his wife revealed last night.

Mr Booth was diagnosed with dementia in 2004 and his fourth wife Stephanie said she is struggling to care for him as his condition worsens.

It became clear Mr Booth was suffering from Alzheimer’s when he became  forgetful and suffered short-term memory loss.

The effects of the condition made it impossible for Mr Booth, who played ‘Scouse Git’ Mike Rawlins in the 1960’s and 1970’s sit-com Till Death Do Us Part, to learn scripts, Mrs Booth said.

She wrote in the Irish Times: ‘We are at the stage where he cannot look after himself. Tony’s forgetfulness is now the greatest threat to his safety.

‘There are dark times when I feel I can no longer cope. It is hard to repeat the same answer again and again as if each time were the first response to the question.’

‘Tony is leaving me and I will not get him back. Hopefully, we are still some way off Tony completely retreating into the hinterland of his mind. Sometimes I wonder if reaching that final stage might not actually be a blessing for him. ‘He is aware of what is happening and can become very frustrated. These are the hardest times for me.’

Mrs Blair, the QC wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, travels from her London home to West Yorkshire at least one day a week to spend the night with her 82-year-old father.

She is Mr Booth’s daughter from his first marriage to Gale Howard. In 1998, he married Mrs Booth, who used to be a regular columnist for the Irish Times.

Mrs Booth described Mrs Blair as a ‘constant source of support’ and added: ‘She looks after her dad regularly, so I can have a break.’

Mr Booth was also known for featuring in the L-Shaped Room in 1962 and more recently for his role in The Contender in 2000.

The news of his illness comes one week after the G8 summit in London where David Cameron pledged to lead a ‘global fightback’ against dementia.

He promised to double funding of research into dementia by 2025 in order to tackle it as HIV and AIDS had been in previous years. He said dementia ‘steals lives’ and ‘wrecks families’.
