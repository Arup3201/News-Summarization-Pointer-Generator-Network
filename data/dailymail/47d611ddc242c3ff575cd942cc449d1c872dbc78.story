A woman who had to have 20 operations to rebuild her face after being thrown from a horse is suing the keeper for huge damages.

Kara Goldsmith, 39, alleges she was left in persistent pain and had to give up her job after the animal trampled on her face in March 2008.

In a High Court action which could have serious implications for hundreds of riding centres nationwide, the mother-of-two claims that equestrians should be granted better legal protection when riding animals that are not their own.

The case against businessman Bradley 
Patchcott has already been thrown out by Judge Christopher Walton, 
sitting at Newcastle County Court.

But Mrs Goldsmith appealed the 
decision and today her barrister argued that the earlier judgment was 
unfair and left his client – and every horse rider in England and Wales,
with no legal protection if their mount unexpectedly behaved 'nastily 
or viciously'.

Addressing three High Court judges, 
Richard Stead described how Mrs Goldsmith had taken nine-year-old 
gelding Red for a ‘test ride’ at Stanley, in Country Durham.

The pair had trotted and cantered for approximately 20 minutes without any problem.

But on the way back to the stable, Red ‘suddenly and without warning reared up full height on his hind legs’.

'He then bucked violently several 
times. Mrs Goldsmith was thrown from the horse and was then struck in 
the face by the horse’s hoof,’ Mr Stead said.

'Her face was stamped upon by the 
horse. She has undergone 20 operations to try and rebuild her face and a
remarkably good job has been done, but she still suffers persistent 
pain and is permanently on pain killers.'

Mrs Goldsmith, who lives with her 
husband Ronald and children, aged ten and six, in Hallgarth, Consett, County 
Durham, had been trying Red out with the intention of buying him.

The court was told that the horse’s 
previous owner was getting rid of him after a fall which caused her to 
'lose her confidence'.

Her barrister said that Mr Patchcott 
knew this – and should have warned her Red, who was being given away for
free, was tricky to control before she took the animal for a ride.

Mr Stead argued that she should have 
won the original case under the Animals Act, which makes keepers of 
animals 'strictly liable' if they are aware they have particular 
'characteristics', not normally found in their species, which create a 
risk of serious injury.

'The judge wrongly concluded that Mrs
Goldsmith voluntarily assumed the risk of injury when in fact the only 
evidence was that the horse bucked in a violent manner so as to throw 
her from the horse,' he said.

'Such behaviour could not have been 
expected from the horse and Mrs Goldsmith would not have ridden the 
horse if she had been aware of the risk.

'The judge wrongly concluded she 
voluntarily assumed the risk of injury caused by violent bucking simply 
by virtue of the fact that she knew that horses could buck when spooked 
and cause the rider to fall off.'

Mrs Goldsmith, an experienced rider, is suing for damages and loss of earnings.

Benjamin Browne QC, defending former 
pharmaceutical company boss Mr Patchcott, said: 'Neither party contended
that the horse had a known propensity to buck violently.

'Mrs Goldsmith consented to the risk 
that the horse could buck. It is obvious that on occasions when a horse 
bucks it will throw its rider.

'The distinction Mrs Goldsmith seeks 
to draw is between general knowledge that a horse may buck and throw its
rider, and knowledge that a horse may buck so violently that even an 
experienced rider cannot stay in the saddle.

'It is suggested that she consented 
to the former but not the latter. Given that the behaviour of horses is 
unpredictable it is submitted that the County Court judge’s approach was
correct.

'Any other approach would produce a wholly unreasonable test', he added.

'The court may need to consider how 
many bucks may be anticipated in a normal horse and how high such bucks 
may be - six inches off the ground? seven inches? eight inches?

'Why should strict liability apply to a person who voluntarily gets on the back of a horse?

'If it does, you are going to get innocent owners penalised who know nothing of any vicious propensity in their animals.

'It is submitted that this was a 
nasty, vicious horse and it bucked and reared much more than Mrs 
Goldsmith could have expected, (but) any horse can buck or rear and you 
simply don’t know as a rider,' Mr Browne concluded.

Recognising the importance of the 
case, Lords Justice Longmore, Rimer and Jackson have now reserved their 
decision until an unspecified later date.
