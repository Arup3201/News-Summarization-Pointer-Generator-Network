Parenthood: Actress Sophie Winkleman and Lord Frederick Windsor (pictured in 2012) welcomed the safe arrival of a daughter yesterday

Prince and Princess Michael of Kent are celebrating becoming grandparents for the first time following the birth of a baby girl to their son and his wife, actress Sophie Winkleman.

Lord Frederick Windsor, 34, was at his wife's side during the birth of their daughter who they've named Maud Elizabeth Daphne Marina.

She was born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre in Los Angeles.

The couple have been based in California to enable Miss Winkleman to pursue her 
acting career, while Lord Windsor is working as a financial analyst.

In a statement Prince and Princess Michael said: 'Lady Frederick Windsor was yesterday safely delivered of a baby girl at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre in Los Angeles.

'The weight of the baby was 7lb. Lord Frederick Windsor was present at the birth.

'Prince and Princess Michael of Kent's family and Sophie's family have been informed and are delighted with the news.'

They added in a further statement: 'The names chosen by Lord and Lady Frederick Windsor for their daughter are Maud Elizabeth Daphne Marina.'

Baby Maud is 42nd in line to the throne, and the Queen, who is a cousin of Prince Michael, has been told of the news.

Ms Winkleman, 33, who has starred in the TV sitcoms Peep Show and US sitcom Two And A Half Men, and Lord Frederick, wed in a lavish ceremony at Hampton Court Palace in 2009.

The Cambridge-educated actress met the Old Etonian banker on a night out with friends in 2007.

They became engaged on Valentine’s
Day in 2009 and went on to wed in September that year. Lord 
Windsor, spelled out his marriage proposal on a Scrabble board.

The couple enjoy the nicknames Windy and Winky.

The talented actress, who is the daughter of children’s book 
author Cindy Black and her husband Barry, a former managing director of 
publisher HarperCollins, made her name starring in the Channel 4 comedy 
series, Peep Show.

She is also the half-sister of TV presenter Claudia Winkleman, and her other acting credits have included Julian 
Fellowes’ ITV drama, Titanic, as well as her current role as Ashton Kutcher’s
girlfriend in Two And A Half Men.

Sophie has widely been given credit for taming Royal playboy Freddie, who has admitted to experimenting with cocaine in the past.

Unlike his father Prince Michael, 70, Lord Freddie has retained his right of succession and is currently 40th in line to the throne.

Prince Michael, who is a cousin to both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, married the then Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz, in 1978.

But he lost his place as eighth in line to the throne when his wife, who is a Catholic, refused to convert to Anglicanism.
