More than 30 families have been left homeless after their shacks in a Nepalese shanty town were burnt to the ground.

Squatters at the shanty town - mainly poor Indian immigrants - already had very few posessions or valuables but they have now lost everything they did own.

The blaze, which apparently broke out because of an electrical short circuit on Sunday, has left them completely destitute with nowhere to sleep at night.

Firefighters attempted to put out the blaze at the Bhimsengola slum in Kathmandu but the 50-odd makeshift bamboo huts, which served as the squatters' homes, burnt to the ground in a matter of minutes.

Big response: Five fire engines, two tankers, Nepalese police and armed services were sent to the scene to battle the blaze

Five fire engines and two tankers were deployed to the scene around 1pm, along with Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army.

Three surrounding buildings also suffered fire damage but firefighters managed to extinguish the blaze before it spread any further.

Many residents could be seen crying in the street or rifling through the rubble in the hopes of finding some surviving remnants of their homes or something of value. Most will now have no choice put to start sleeping rough on the streets.

DSP Abhinarayan Kafle, in charge of the Gaushala Metropolitan Police Circile, said: 'There are no casualties. However, the houses have been completely destroyed.'

Kathmandu is home to nearly 50,000 squatters spread across the city's slums, which are often located along the Bagmati river in areas at risk of landslides.

Most slums are seriously overcrowded with several people living in a single room leading to the spread of diseases.

Many slum residents are under threat of being evicted to make way for developments as the Government hopes to clean up the area and promote new business.
