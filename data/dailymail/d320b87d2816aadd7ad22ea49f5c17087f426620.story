Emotional: Nazir Akbari, 27, wept in the dock and cried 'sorry mum' during a sentencing hearing at Downing Centre District Court on Thursday

A former bikie associate wept in court today as he stood accused of attempting to extort a smash repairman to the value of $10,000.

Ex ‘Brothers 4 Life’ associate Nazir Akbari, 27, took the stand at Downing Centre District Court on Thursday, crying ‘I'm sorry mum’ while holding his head in his hands.

Akbari and his co-accused Mohammed Nasiri, 23, have pleaded guilty to several charges stemming from an extortion attempt by the Brothers 4 Life which targeted a smash repair business last year.

At their sentence hearing, the Downing Centre District Court heard the businessman, who does not wish to be identified, received two calls in July from gang members demanding $40,000.

‘We have 4000 foot soldiers, nothing can save you,’ he was told.

They told the man that unless he coughed up the cash ‘We will hurt you and blow up your shop’.Akbari and Nasiri did not make those specific calls but police say the pair went to the shop a month later and demanded $10,000.

Akbari and his family cried as he described his sense of shame over what he had done.

He said the Brothers 4 Life gang ‘filled him with drugs’ after became involved with the Bankstown chapter of the gang.

The court heard the western Sydney chapter has since 'disbanded' and Akbari wanted nothing more to do with them, but is forced to see members every day in jail.

‘They have us all together, so I just say “Hi” and “Goodbye”,’ he said.

‘I want to change, I want to become a better person’.

Nasiri, meanwhile, said he was ‘foolish’ for getting involved in the gang, whose members face charges over several Sydney shootings.

‘I'm very remorseful, I'm very sorry... Looking back at it I could have said, “No”,’ he said.

Nasiri said he wants to finish his Higher School Certificate and spend time with his mother and father after being released from prison.

Both men have pleaded guilty to several charges, including demanding property with menace and participating in a criminal group.

Akbari has posted photos of himself online posing in Brothers 4 Life gear and portraying strength with a tightly clenched fist.

Following strenuous work by NSW police, the Brothers 4 Life gang chapters in Blacktown and Bankstown have largely been quashed, having enjoyed a peak of power in 2011.

Their matter will return to court on June 27.
