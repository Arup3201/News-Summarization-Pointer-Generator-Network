Reece Burke’s last-minute tap in eased the pressure on Sam Allardyce as West Ham finally recorded their first win of pre-season against Sampdoria.

The youngster tapped home after Mo Diame’s superb solo effort had hauled the Hammers level after goals from Stefan Okaka and Citadin Eder sandwiched Mark Noble’s penalty.

But there were still plenty of concerns for Allardyce with the start of the Premier League season less than a week away and simmering tensions with the board and fans still brewing.

The need for a fit striker to replace the injured Andy Carroll was obvious, with Carlton Cole

floundering up top and Enner Valencia still some way from match fitness, and the ease with which Okaka and Eder walked through the home defence for their goals was the stuff of nightmares.

The fact Kevin Nolan was already defending his manager in his programme notes before a Premier League ball has even been kicked must also raise question marks.

There were encouraging signs though, with a new 3-5-2 formation working well in the first half and new signings Cheikhou Kouyate, Mauro Zarate and Aaron Cresswell – who was forced off with an injury after half an hour – all impressing, and Stuart Downing acclimatising well to a right wing-back role.

It could easily have been a win too with Downing hitting the post late on and Nolan curling wide.West Ham looked the better in the early exchanges, passing the ball out of defence with ease, but went behind on 16 minutes. Sampdoria had threatened to expose the gap behind the Hammers defence twice already when Okaka outmuscled James Collins and slotted past Adrian.

Cole thought he had equalised but was ruled offside when he collected Cresswell’s scuffed shot, and Nolan wasted a superb opportunity when unmarked on the penalty spot.

At the other end, Eder should have scored but dragged his effort wide from Lorenzo De Silvestri’s cut-back.

Kouyate was winning over the Upton Park crowd with an all action display, blocking a chance at one end and then coming close twice at the other – sending a half volley straight at Da Costa and then just failing to control Mark Noble’s throughball.

Noble did bring the Hammers level in first-half injury time. Cresswell’s replacement Dan Potts showed quick feet in the box and was brought down, with Noble coolly converting to the keeper’s left.

Lots to do? Sam Allardyce watches on as his side came back from behind twice at Upton Park

 Te came in for Zarate at half time and the Hammers switched to a more 
familiar 4-4-1-1 formation with Nolan playing behind Cole.

Manolo
 Gabbiadini shot high and wide after Winston Reid misjudged a long ball 
and Kouyate continue to impress, but his shot across goal was just too 
far in front of Cole.

Sampdoria went back in front when Eder found himself in acres of space between Tomkins and Collins and finished with ease.

Allardyce’s
 men  fought back though and Diame’s introduction reenergised them 
before he got the equaliser, wriggling past three defenders before 
firing low in the near corner.

The
 home side pushed for a winner, with Downing seeing his close-range shot
 come back off the post, before Burke touched home from two yards from 
Elliot Lee’s cross to end the Hammers’ pre-season hoodoo and give 
Allardyce some much needed cheer.
