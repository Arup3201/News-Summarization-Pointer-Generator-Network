Prime Minister Tony Abbott - the target of Julia Gillard's famous misogyny speech - has suggested sexism was behind recent criticisms of his powerful chief of staff. 

Mr Abbott today slapped down members of his own party following reports this week of growing tension between Peta Credlin - his top adviser - and coalition ministers. 

'Do you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was P-E-T-E-R as opposed to P-E-T-A?' Mr Abbott told ABC television. 

'I think people need to take a long hard look at themselves with some of these criticisms.'

Statement: Prime Minister Tony Abbott has the attacks on his chief adviser Peta Credlin are motivated by sexism

'I think people need to take a good hard look at themselves': Mr Abbott has rushed to the defence of his chief of staff

Power player: Peta Credlin, pictured, is considered a significant figure in the Abbott Government - but her control over government ministers has reportedly led to tensions

'They're like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank': Earlier this week, that is what a Liberal frontbencher reportedly said about Ms Credlin, left, and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop

'Do you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was P-E-T-E-R as opposed to P-E-T-A?

'I think people need to take a long hard look at themselves with some of these criticisms.

'This is the same office which ran a very effective opposition, it's the same office which has got an enormous amount done this year sometimes under very difficult circumstances.'

Mr Abbott's statement has already set the Twittersphere tittering as the prime minister has long been targeted by critics - fairly or unfairly, depending on your view - over his apparent 'women problem.'

When he was Opposition Leader, Prime Minister Gillard famously savaged Mr Abbott's perceived attitudes to women in a speech on the floor of Parliament.

'I will not be lectured on sexism or misogny by this man,' she said, in a speech that soon went viral. 

Mr Abbott's appearance at a 2011 anti-carbon tax rally in front of signs reading 'Ditch the witch' and 'Juliar  is Bob Brown's b****' was similarly controversial.

And in May, Mr Abbott was forced to apologise after he winked at ABC Radio presenter Jon Faine when a talkback caller announced she was a sex worker.

The prime minister's remarks today follow claims this week that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop - the only senior female minister in the Abbott Government - had fallen out with Ms Credlin.

'They're like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank,' a senior Coalition source told The Australian newspaper on Tuesday.

The Foreign Minister has reportedly decided not to take any orders from Ms Credlin and other senior Cabinet members are concerned Mr Abbott's chief aide wields too much power.  

But Mr Abbott today said if people had a problem with his office they should bring the complaints to him.

'I shouldn't have done it, Karl': Mr Abbott later apologised after he winked at a radio presenter when a caller announced she was a sex worker

Controversy: Mr Abbott's appearance in front of these signs at a 2011 anti-carbon tax rally was also a major topic of criticism 

Target: Prime Minister Julia Gillard, pictured here, rounded on Mr Abbott in her famous 'misogny' speech

We are a place where opposition leaders, prime ministers, ministers and shadow ministers should be judged on their record, should be judged on their deeds, not on their gender and, frankly, as the father of three daughters I want them to be judged on what they do.

I do not want them to be judged favourably or unfavourably on the basis of their gender and I think it’s time that everyone in the Parliament moved on from this gender card which so many members of the Government have been playing.

'This is the same office which ran a very effective opposition, it's the same office which has got an enormous amount done this year sometimes under very difficult circumstances,' he said. 

There has been growing speculation of disunity in Coalition ranks recently.

Late last week, the Australian Financial Review reported that Ms Bishop 'went bananas' at Mr Abbott when she was not consulted about a plan for a male colleague to 'chaperone' her to a climate change conference in Lima, Peru.

It was claimed Trade Minister Andrew Robb was accompanying Ms Bishop to ensure Australia did not over-commit on his climate change policy promises.  

The bust-ups have overshadowed a significant announcement in Lima by Ms Bishop that Australia will contribute $200 million to a global fund to help poorer nations tackle climate change.

Mr Abbott last week admitted the government had been performing in a 'ragged' way recently. 

This week, he watered down his plans to introduce a GP co-payment, canning his initial policy of introducing a $7 fee for most Australians when they visit the doctor.

Colleagues:  Julie Bishop took issue with Tony Abbott's decision to 'chaperone' her at the United Nations conference and now there are claims she is at odds with his chief of staff, Peta Credlin

One front-bencher says Julie Bishop is unhappy at the level of control Peta Credlin as the PM's chief of staff. The Foreign Minister's office denies the claims
