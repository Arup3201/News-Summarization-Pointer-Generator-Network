David Cameron has said that he will remain in Parliament as an MP even if he is forced to leave Downing Street after the election.

The Prime Minister said that he 'loves public service' and would continue to serve his constituents even if he is 'hoofed out' of Number 10 in May.

In contrast to Tony Blair, who left Parliament when he stopped being prime minister in 2007 and has made a personal fortune, Mr Cameron said he planned to 'stick with' voters in his Witney constituency.

Prime Minister David Cameron said he will remain in Parliament as an MP even if he loses the election 

Mr Cameron insisted the Conservatives could win a majority and said that no one on his team was preparing contingencies for a hung parliament

He said: 'I love serving my constituents, I love public service, I think it's what I care about. It's a vocation for me.

'In the unhappy event I'm not Prime Minister on May 8, the people of West Oxfordshire I hope will stick with me and I'll stick with them.'

Asked what he would do if he was no longer Prime Minister in an interview with the website BuzzFeed, Mr Cameron said: 'I'm not going to think about that because I've got 50 days to fight the vital election and want to win re-election.

'I think this Government is doing some good things for our country and I want to keep on doing that.

'It's the country's choice, if they hoof me out and go for the other guy, I'll have to think of something else. But I hope I hope I'll still be a Member of Parliament.'

He insisted that the Conservatives could win a majority and said that no one on his team was preparing contingencies for a hung parliament.

During the online interview, Mr Cameron said he was proud of the 'genuinely ground-breaking' work the Government has done on internet safety and spoke about his own children.

He said: 'Now when you set up your account the filters are automatically on. I' ve got three children of primary school age and they get to find out the code on your iPad pretty quickly.

'It is reassuring to know the Government has done some very good things on this. I think having the filters switched on is good.'

Mr Cameron said that his children do not have unfettered access to mobile phones. He said: 'My daughter has got an iTouch but everything is quite strictly controlled in terms of screen time and we have the filters on for things like my iPad.

'But this is a conversation every parent in the country is having with their children. What age should they be when they should have a Facebook account and unfettered access to a mobile phone?

'We've got an 11-year-old, a nine-year-old and a four-year-old so we're not at that stage yet.'

Mr Cameron said that he personally has an iPhone 'which is basically for family and friends' and a BlackBerry that he uses for work emails.

He said that he was not a user of the popular phone app SnapChat, but he said that he sometimes looked at the messages people send him on Twitter, adding: 'You have got to take the rough with the smooth in this job.'

When asked if he ever sneaks out of Downing Street without his security detail, Mr Cameron said: 'No because they are trained killers.'

Questioned on the four schoolgirls from east London who are thought to have fled to Syria to join the so-called Islamic State, Mr Cameron said: 'I think they're deeply misguided and potentially joining a criminal organisation that could make them part of a terrorist conspiracy.

'We want to get them back and try to get this radical nonsense out of their heads.'

Mr Cameron disclosed that - like Ed Miliband - he has two kitchens in his London home.

But the Prime Minister said he had the second kitchen installed in his house in Notting Hill for the benefit of the carers who looked after his disabled son Ivan, who died in 2009.

Mr Miliband last week faced accusations that he was out of touch following the disclosure that he had two kitchens after he and his wife Justine were filmed in the smaller of the pair for a BBC interview.

Mr Cameron said: 'We actually had to extend into the basement and we put in an extra kitchen, not least because I had a very disabled son, Ivan, and his carers were there and they looked after him and so we did that for them as well has for him.

'The point is not whether you have got two kitchens, but whether you have a photocall in one of them and pretend it's your kitchen. That's the issue.'

The interview was part of the American website's BuzzFeed Brews series that usually sees people answer questions over a beer.

Mr Cameron dressed down for the event in front of trendy advertising and new media types by wearing an open-necked shirt, but he declined an alcoholic drink and instead sipped water during the interview in central London.

He told the audience that he was a 'big fan' of popular television series Game of Thrones.

BuzzFeed, which is well-known for its list-based articles, has become increasingly popular with young people on both sides of the Atlantic, but Mr Cameron faced embarrassment at a No 10 Christmas drinks party in December last year when he asked a group of the site's writers: 'What is 'the BuzzFeed'?'
