Dutch legend Johan Cruyff believes Barcelona were fortunate to come out of Sunday's El Clasico against Real Madrid with all three points.

Goals from Jeremy Mathieu and Luis Suarez handed the Catalans victory at the Nou Camp, despite the best efforts of Cristiano Ronaldo who bagged Real Madrid's goal.

The win sends Barcelona four points clear at the top of La Liga, but Cruyff, who spent time as both a player and a manager at the Nou Camp, was less than impressed with the way his former club played against Los Blancos.

'Football is so great, that you can play a match poorly and win,' the Dutchman told AS.

'When a team plays well, the logical outcome is a win, but when a team plays poorly and wins...

'How many balls did Barca concede? Who won on possession? Madrid, no? Well that's all that needs to be said.'
