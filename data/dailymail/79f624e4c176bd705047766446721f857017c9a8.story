A 33-year-old mother has been arrested on charges she sexually assaulted her daughter’s 14-year-old boyfriend.

Sarah Maria Torres was arrested on Tuesday and is accused of assaulting the boy in his own home.

Neighbors of the Sugar Land, Texas woman are doubly concerned over the disturbing accusations because Torres ran a day care center out of her own home.

Accused: Sugar Land, Texas mom who runs a day care center stands accused of having sex with her daughter's 14-year-old ex-boyfriend

And as appalled as they all are, those who live near Torres are just as shocked by the charges against her.

‘Very nice neighbor,’ is how Kattia Sarge described Torres to KHOU. ‘To me a great mom, involved with her kids.’

But was she too involved?

'Very nice neighbor': Kattia Sarge was shocked at the charges. Police say Sarah Maria Torres had sex with the boy in his own home on a day he was supposed to be in school

Torres is now behind bars and held there on $150,000 bond after police say she sexually assaulted the boy on May 23.

That was a Thursday, a day the boy was supposed to be in school, but stayed home.

Torres and her family live in the same neighborhood as the boy and police say she assaulted the boy in his family’s home.

Appalled: Neighbor Sammy Nara said his 9-year-old grandson won't be playing around the neighborhood any longer

The victim’s mother provided what she said is evidence of the assault.

However, the police aren’t releasing what exactly that evidence is.

Police were notified of the alleged incident after the teenager told a family member he’d had sex with Torres.

Torres is being held in Fort Bend County Jail on $150,000 bond.
