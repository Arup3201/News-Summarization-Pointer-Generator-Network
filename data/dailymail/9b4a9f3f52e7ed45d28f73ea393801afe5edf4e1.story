Sentimental: The diamond ring was given to Wendy Dolton, left, by her husband Malcolm, right, just months before he too died from cancer

A thief ripped a diamond wedding ring off the finger of a cancer patient as she lay dying in a hospice.

Wendy Dolton, 65, who had lung cancer, succumbed to the disease just hours after she was targeted in her death bed by the 'despicable coward'.

Her grieving family say they are devastated at the loss of the ring, which was a gift from Wendy's husband Malcolm just months before he too died from cancer.

Wendy's son Sean said his mother was 'violated' when she was at her weakest.

He said: 'It is the most vile and despicable crime that someone would come into her room where she was being cared for and take the ring from her finger.

'I remember seeing her wearing it just hours before and can't believe someone stole it from her in those last few hours.

'She was totally violated when she was at her weakest.

'It is difficult enough to deal with losing her so tragically, but to know how and when it was taken is very difficult.'

The ring, which has a large square diamond, was given to the great grandmother in 2004 as a 40th anniversary present from her husband. 

Just months later, he was diagnosed with throat cancer and died soon afterwards at Pilgrim’s Hospice in Canterbury, Kent - the same hospice where Wendy was cared for.

Furious: Wendy Dolton's family said they are devastated that she was targeted on her death bed and said they would never have sold the ring and wanted to keep it in the family

Tragic: Wendy Dolton and her husband Malcolm taken on the day on which he had presented her with a gold ring, which was taken despicably as she lay dying

Sean Dolton, a firefighter, said the theft is 'unforgivable' and has urged the thief to return it.

The 46-year-old said: 'It is a despicable crime by a coward to prey on somebody in the last 24 hours of their life when they are that vulnerable.

'I can’t put it into words how upset my family is. That ring was so special to our family. My dad gave it to my mum as a 40th anniversary gift.'

Police believe the thief struck either on the eve of Wendy's death, or the actual day she died - February 14.

Happier times: These pictures were taken months before Malcolm's death on their 40th wedding anniversary, which they spent with their sons Dean, 48 ( pictured right, far left) and Sean, 46 (far right)

Mother-of-two 
Wendy, from Dover, Kent, who was company director of a micro engineering
firm, was diagnosed with lung cancer in October - but it quickly spread
to her 
bones, breasts and brain.

Mr Dolton, from Chelmsford, Essex, said: 'This has been a really tough time for my family and this is the last thing we needed.

'My
mum died at 5pm and I noticed the ring was missing an hour later. We 
all just wanted to go home to grieve, but we had to stay until midnight 
for the police to arrive.

'We wanted the ring to pass down through the family. The ring was very special to my mother and I would never have sold it.

'She had always hoped I would one day give it to someone special.

'She treasured it - it is totally unforgivable how it was taken. It is 
totally and utterly priceless and I desperately want it back.'

Bereft: The desperate sons of Mr and Mrs Dolton say they want the ring to be give back them because in their eyes it is 'priceless'

Police Constable Chris Poulter, from Kent Police, said: ‘The theft of the ring has caused a great deal of upset for Wendy’s family at a time when they are already trying to cope with her sad passing.

'Pilgrim’s Hospice has been fully co-operative and our investigation continues.

'We have already visited some second hand shops and will continue to make inquiries.'
