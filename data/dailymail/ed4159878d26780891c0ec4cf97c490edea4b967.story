A policeman lured a 16-year-old Australian girl to his home through a couch surfing website before drugging and assaulting her, it has been claimed.

Dino Maglio, 35, who lives in Padua, Italy, used the name of Leonardo on Couchsurfing.com to entice the girl, who was travelling with her mother and sister, prosecutors say.

He has admitted drugging her with a tranquilliser and having sex, even though he knew she was underage, and is due to stand trial next month.

Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liquer belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason'

Since the allegations were made, more than a dozen women have come forward claiming they were assaulted by Maglio after using the host-a-traveller website to arrange accommodation.

The case has raised safety concerns surrounding the social networking site, which puts travellers in touch with hosts who are willing to put them up and show them around their hometowns for free.

It has been linked to several alleged sexual assaults over the years, including the rape of a Hong Kong tourist in Leeds, according to the Guardian.

The website's chief executive, Jennifer Billock, told the newspaper users' safety was a top priority and it was constantly 'evolving our tools and processes to find and halt abusers of our system'. 

It is believed that Maglio had told one alleged victim he closed his profile because he had so many positive reviews he had to open a new one.

The Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPO), which carried out a year-long investigation, said that 14 testimonies collected revealed a man who seemed like a fun and fast-living host.

Some claim he would constantly compliment them and insist they drink while they were out together and on the first or second night say they were served drinks of tea or wine.

They did not report feeling unsafe as they were not travelling alone but in separate incidents from March 2013 until March 2014, the women recalled feeling suddenly 'woozy and intensely tired'.

Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liquer belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason'.

He told investigators the sex was consensual and that he had joined Couchsurfing to improve his English, as he believed it would help further his career.

More than a dozen women have since come forward after finding his profile on the social network and staying at his flat in the picturesque city of Padua in northern Italy 

In a victim statement, one Canadian woman alleged she had tried to rouse three other female visitors staying at Maglio's after she discovered them passed out before falling unconscious herself.

She added that she had hazy memories of being kissed and fondled by Maglio but was unable to protest. Others feared they had been slipped the drugged and were unsure if anything had happened while they were passed out.

Three young woman from Czech Republic also said they had been unable to recall what happened after staying at the defendant's home and drinking his wine.

They claim they had brief flashes of being kissed and touched by Maglio and vomited when they woke up. 

Another traveller from Hong Kong claimed she was unconscious after drinking his alcohol and posted a negative review on his Couchsurfing profile.

The next day he allegedly sent her a threatening message over Facebook demanding she remove it and said that if she refused he would use his authority as a police officer to create 'trouble' for her on her next visit to Europe. 

'It took me some days to realise I was sexually abused,' the alleged victim told IRPI. 'So I wrote to him on Facebook. I asked him what happened and he admitted we had sex. I felt like a whore. I felt nobody would ever want me again after this.'

The alleged attacks came to light after the women connected on the website to share their experiences, reports say. 

When his home was searched officers found a gun and a large amount of pornography and child abuse images, according to the Guardian. 

Court papers showed he was also hosting two other Couchsurfing tourists at the time - with one showing the same 'sickness' as other alleged victims. 

Maglio is being held in a military prison for his own protection and police chiefs say he has been suspended from duty.

He will go on trial in Padua near Venice on March 17 on charges of raping a minor with the aggravating circumstance of having administered a narcotic without her knowledge.
