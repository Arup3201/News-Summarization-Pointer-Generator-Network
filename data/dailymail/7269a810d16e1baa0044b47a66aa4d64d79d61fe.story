Mistake: Robert Maday, 42, pictured, was convicted on Wednesday thanks to a letter he wrote to his girlfriend boasting about his crime spree

An Illinois bank robber who escaped from custody and went on a 27-hour crime spree has been convicted thanks to a bragging love letter he wrote to his girlfriend.

Robert Maday, 42, was already a convicted bank robber when he wrestled two Cook County state's attorney investigators as they drove him to court in 2009, getting away with their guns and one of the men's pants.

He used the guns to commit separate hijackings against two women in Chicago's suburbs before robbing a bank, all while being hunted by police.

After his 27 hours on the lam, Maday was re-captured and penned the detailed letter to girlfriend Lisa Barruzza in custody, according to WLS-TV.

It was used today to convict him of all five escape, bank robbery and weapons counts he was facing.

In the letter, Maday boasts of his 'so elaborate, so enticing' plan to evade the authorities after making his getaway but bemoaned how it was foiled before he made it out of the state.

'What does one say to the person you love most at the end of yet another failure?' he wrote to Barruzza. 'I had a plan so thorough, so elaborate, so enticing, so...I won't tease you with it now.'

Maday even referred to the bank he robbed while on the run.

'Got my getaway $ Friday (20 hours 
behind schedule) from a vault in Bloomingdale!' he wrote. 'All I needed 
was a car that wasn't being looked for by an army.'

The manhunt resulted in a high-speed car chase, crash and his arrest.

'I only needed to step foot out of Illinois; got beyond the reach of the hunt that was underway,' he wrote in the letter. 'I tried darling. I gave it my best attempt.'

Prosecutors said Maday's own written words helped convict him.

'He was telling numerous people he came into contact with that he was the escapee on the run,' assistant U.S. attorney Annie Kastanek told WLS-TV.

'He seemed to think in his own mind that he was this legendary criminal.'

In addition to the federal convictions, Maday already faces 43 years in state prison for previous crimes and the carjackings during his time on the run.

Maday lamented in the letter that he would be an 'old man' before he saw his love again, and begged Barruzza to forgive him for hurting her.

'I'm sorry if you were humiliated by me Lisa,' he wrote.

'Forgive me please. For everything. For hurting you like I have. I will be an old man when I come home. 58, 60, 62, 70. I almost succeeded Lisa. Please remember that. I was really close.'
