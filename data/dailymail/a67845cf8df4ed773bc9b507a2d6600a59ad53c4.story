Boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao played a starring role as one of the judges at Sunday's Miss Universe Pageant.

The Filipino ring king headlined the list of judges, which also included billionaire businessman Donald Trump and reality TV star Kristin Cavallari, in the competition which was won by Miss Colombia Paulina Vega.

As his role as judge, Pacquiao, whose career earnings surpassed $300million (£200m) in 2014, posed a question to Miss USA Nia Sanchez.

Miss Colombia saw off competition from contestants from 87 other countries to take the crown.

Miss USA and Miss Ukraine Diana Harkusha were the runners-up during Sunday's competition. Miss Jamaica Kaci Fennell and Miss Netherlands Yasmin Verheijen were also among the top five.

Vega said the contests leading to Miss Universe were the first she'd participated in and will be her last, as she's eager to return to her studies in business administration.

The 22-year-old is the granddaughter of a legendary tenor, Gaston Vega. 

She has said: 'It will be a dream come true to represent the woman of today. A woman that not only cares about being beautiful and being glamorous, but also cares about being a professional, intelligent, hard-working person.'

The 24-year-old Sanchez has a fourth-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and has traveled the country teaching others. She spoke previously about equipping women to defend themselves against crime.

'It's just something that's so prevalent in our society, and why not empower women to take control of a dangerous situation into their own hand,' she said. 

Miss Colombia was crowned by the outgoing Miss Universe, Gabriela Isler of Venezuela. The broadcast included performances by singers Nick Jonas and Prince Royce.

Crowd favorite Miss Venezuela Migbelis Lynette Castellanos was cut after the top 10. The Miami suburb of Doral, which was host to the women during their stay, is also known as 'Doralzuela' for its many Venezuelan residents.

Three of the last six Miss Universe titles have gone to Venezuela, where beauty pageants are big business.
