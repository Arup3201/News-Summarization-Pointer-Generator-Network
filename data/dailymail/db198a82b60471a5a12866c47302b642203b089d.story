An artist has shown tree-mendous patience twisting and turning copper wire 1,000 times to make these intricate bonsai plants.

Ken To, 39, spends between three and 12 hours making each tree, which he sells around the world for up to £200.

His painstaking creations stand as little as one inch tall, and have extremely thin branches of just 1/8 of an inch.

Mr To was originally a fan of real bonsai - a Japanese art form using miniature trees grown in containers - before he started to recreate them from wire.

He uses different colours of copper-plated wire, which he bends with a pair of pliers he specially filed down to a tiny size to give him ultimate control.

Each model is 'planted' in real bonsai pots or attached to little rocks to 'create a more dramatic effect'.

Mr To, from California, U.S., said: 'I apply the same shaping principles to both real and wire trees.

'The wire trees require a much higher degree of attention to detail in the shaping process, but it is a one-time process.

'With real bonsai, the shaping process is ongoing - I shape the tree, let the foliage grow back, then shape again and again.'

Mr To said: 'My designs are inspired by real bonsai trees, but I don't copy them exactly'

Mr To cuts the wire into individual strands, straightens them out, and then twists them together by hand to form the basic shape of the tree.

He shapes the foliage with his pliers.

Mr To added: 'My designs are inspired by real bonsai trees, but I don't copy them exactly.

'If I see a bonsai tree that I like, I would just keep the basic structure in my mind and use that mental image when I'm making a wire sculpture.

'I believe actually copying a tree hinders your creativity and this shows in the end product.'
