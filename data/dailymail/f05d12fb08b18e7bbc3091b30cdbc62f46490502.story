Ordeal: Sahil Saeed, then five-years-old, was kidnapped and held for 13 days before being ransomed back to his family for £110,000

A British businessman today told a court of the terrifying moment an armed gang kidnapped his five-year-old son in Pakistan.

Sahil Saeed, from Oldham, was held captive for 13 days after being snatched while visiting his sick grandmother.

His father Raja Saeed, 30, described the moment four men wearing balaclavas and carrying assault rifles and pistols fled with the youngster.

And he described how the ordeal transformed his son from a 'bubbly' toddler into a 'scared and stressed' child.

Mr Saeed said the gang bound and gagged him then beat him and his relatives after assaulting the family's home in Jhelum, Punjab in March 2010.

He said: 'A person came up to me pointing a gun at me and made me lie down on the floor.

'He had a big gun, like an AK47. They tied everyone up and held us for several hours in a bedroom. They tortured one of my uncles a lot, and kicked and slapped us.

'They told me they were going to take my son and I had to pay £100,000 ransom. Then they left the house and took my son.'

He was told: 'If you try to contact the police or involve them, we will kill him,' prosecutors allege.

The gang fled with cash, jewellery, watches and even kitchen appliances as well as taking Sahil.

He was released unhurt almost two weeks later after his uncle Tauseer Ahmed travelled from the UK to France and handed over a £110,000 ransom.

Three people were arrested in Spain after police raided a flat near Tarragona, where they recovered the ransom money.

Mr Saeed told Tarragona Provincial Court his son has not been the same since the kidnapping.

He said: 'My son is not the kind of bubbly kid he was any more.

'He used to be a laugh with me, playing, a happy kid but now he's always scared. A few months ago he started speaking about about the kidnap.

'He's scared all the time. At school he's not that clever any more. He's always stressed and under pressure.

'It has affected my son and the rest of the family.'

Mr Saeed revealed Sahil has been seeing a school psychiatrist to help get over the traumatic memories of his ordeal.

He told the court his son learned to swear in Punjabi while being held, and was taken out riding on a buffalo by his captors.

Sahil's uncle Tauseer Ahmed told the court the boy's mother Akila 'went through hell' when her son was being held.

Mr Ahmed told how he he followed the kidnappers' instructions to travel from the UK to Paris where he left the ransom money by a park bench.

Kidnapped: Sahil was snatched from his grandmother's home here in Jhelum, Pakistan, in March 2010

Undercover cops monitored the exchange and then followed Monica Neruja, 26, from Galati, Romania, and her husband Muhammed Zahid Saleem, 36, from Pakistan, as they drove from Paris with the money to their home in the town of Constanti, 60 miles south west of Barcelona.

When the boy was freed armed police raided the flat and arrested the couple and flatmate Muhammad Sageiz, who was living illegally in Spain. They recovered most of the ransom money in a bag in the flat.

The three of them are accused of planning and organising the kidnap.

They deny kidnap, robbery, belonging to a criminal organisation and illegal detention. Prosecutors have called for them to be jailed for up to 25 years.

The trial continues.
