An amateur astronomer has become the first person to capture a massive lightning strike 'into space' above the British Isles.

The atmospheric phenomena, known as sprites, had never been recorded in the UK before an amateur astronomer in East Yorkshire managed to take the photographic first.

Richard Kacerek, 33, spotted the 
sprite - caused by an upward lightning discharge five miles east of Hull - and has sparked excitement in the scientific community with his image.

An amateur astronomer has become the first person to capture a massive lightning strike 'into space' (pictured) above the British Isles. The atmospheric phenomena, known as sprites, had never been recorded in the UK before

Sprites are shards of light caused by large-scale electrical discharges that take place high above thunderstorm clouds.

They cause a varied range of visual shapes in the night sky but have never been recorded before in the UK.

Mr Kacerek spotted the sprite on Tuesday night from a camera set up in Hull.

He said: 'Astronomy is my hobby, I am not a scientist so I am delighted to have captured the sprite, it was such an interesting event.

'They are a fascinating phenomena as they happen in the atmosphere above the storm clouds.

'They are relatively unknown and it looked a little special so I sent it to Dr Martin Fullekrug at Bath University and he said it was the first spotted over the UK.

'I think luck had a lot to do with it.'

Mr Kacerek spotted
 the sprite on a camera that is part of the UK Meteor Observing Network,
 which amateur stargazers can use to observe space.

Dr Fullekrug, an expert in the electrodynamic properties of the atmosphere at the University of Bath, has carried out a number of studies on sprites.

He said: 'This particular sprite is a rare example of sprites that can occur over the North Sea.

'The lightning flash inside the thunderstorm, which caused the sprite above the cloud was also unique.'

The UK Met Office recorded the thunderstorm using the ATDnet lightning detection network, which is ordinarily used for real-time forecasts of flash floods, hail, and wind gusts often associated with thunderstorms.

Graeme Anderson, foundation scientist for the UK Met Office, said: 'The ATDnet lightning location system operated by the Met Office picked up widespread and particularly intense storms across the UK during Tuesday 23 July.

'The storms detected in the region near Hull developed around the wash before moving northwards, but were of only moderate intensity and were small compared with some other storms that occurred on that day in other areas.'

The first colour image of a sprite was captured as part of  a 1994 NASA/University of Alaska aircraft campaign to study the rare lightning strikes. The red color was found to be from nitrogen fluorescent emissions excited by a lightning stroke in the underlying thunderstorm

Alec Bennett, who develops lightning detectors for BIRAL, a Bristol-based company, predicted sprites would occur during thunderstorms approaching the UK from the Atlantic with his electrical sensors.

He said Mr Kacerek was very fortunate to catch this extremely rare phenomenon on camera.

Dr Fullekrug said: 'Citizen scientists can play a major role in unravelling the mysteries of lightning into space.

'It is well known that upward lightning is a necessary condition to initiate lightning into space, but upward lightning alone is not sufficient.

'There are yet unknown factors which will be investigated in more detail during two upcoming space missions due to be carried out by the French and European Space Agency in 2015.

'Citizen scientists can make a major contribution by reporting sprite occurrence times.'
