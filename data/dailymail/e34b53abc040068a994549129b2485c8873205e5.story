Troubled footballer Clarke Carlisle today apologised to the driver of the lorry which he jumped in front of in a desperate attempt to kill himself.

The former Premier League defender said that he prays for the driver, Darren Pease, every day - but added that he has been unable to apologise in person because the haulier refuses to meet him.

Mr Carlisle, 35, who has publicly stuggled with depression, also said that the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving.

Apology: Clarke Carlisle today said that he felt sorry for the lorry driver he jumped in front of in December

The sportsman, dubbed 'Britain's brainiest footballer' after he appeared on Countdown in 2002, tried to kill himself in December, two days after he was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving.

He was left critically injured after jumping in front of Mr Pease's 12-ton lorry on the dual carriageway, and although he has made a full recovery his face is now covered in scars.

Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain today, Mr Carlisle said he was 'so sorry' for putting Mr Pease through the ordeal of being involved in a near-fatal crash.

'I think about him and pray for him every day, I am so sorry to him,' he said. 'I am so sorry for what my actions would have done to him because it will be as equally a traumatic experience for him as it was for me and my family.

'I've tried to contact him and reach out in person but he doesn't want that to happen and I have to respect that. He needs to recover in the way that he sees fit and I apologise profusely for the impact I've had on his life.'

Speaking earlier this month, Mr Pease, 53, said that he might never be able to drive a lorry again after hitting Mr Carlisle.

'I get depressed and I get mad and angry,' he told the Sunday Mirror. 'Physically I get knots in my stomach, I'm anxious.

'That feeling is indescribable - to think you are going to die. I don't think I'll ever be able to get behind the wheel of a lorry again. I can't see any way back for me at this point.'

Mr Carlisle told Good Morning Britain that his severe depression had driven him to his 'lowest ebb', making him ignore his good fortune and loving family.

'It was the lowest place that you can possibly be,' he said. 'At 35 I’ve had experience in life, I’ve got three beautiful children, I was married, and you get something that comes over you that takes your eyes off all of that and actually rationalises the option of committing suicide. You know you must be at your lowest ebb and I was there.'

Asked about the scars he suffered from his suicide attempt, Mr Carlisle said: 'They're a constant reminder.

'Today on a daily basis they remind me how blessed I am and they remind me that it could have been so different. I've been given another opportunity in life and I'm going to take it.'

The former player addressed criticism from his former housemate, actor Ralf Little, who said that Mr Carlisle would 'get away with it again' after he spoke out about his depression.

The two men are belived to have fallen out when Mr Carlisle took Mr Little's credit card and spent his money on alcohol, but today Mr Carlisle said he wished his old friend 'every blessing'.

He said: 'Ralf was a very good friend of mine and back in the day we lived together and because of my chaotic lifestyle, I hurt him and there are consequences to those actions.

'I'm not sat here asking for absolution of responsibility, there's just an element of understanding and awareness that I think needs to [be raised] in society about the illness.

'Ralf has every right to hold his opinions and I wish him every blessing.'

Mr Carlisle also talked about recent comments by columnist Katie Hopkins, who described suicidal people as 'attention-seeking b******s' and suggested that exercise could cure depression.

'From those tweets you can see that Katie Hopkins clearly doesn't understand depression and hasn't grasped the fact that it's an illness,' he told Good Morning Britain.

'It's no more an option to not be depressed than it's an option to not have flu. It is an illness that is upon you and it needs diagnosing and treating - but there is an element of truth in what she says, physical exercise is scientifically proven to be a good remedy for mild to moderate depression and anxiety.'

Mr Carlisle played for nine different clubs in his 16-year career, including five years at Burnley, and served as chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association.

Last week, he pleaded guilty to failing to provide a sample when he was stopped by police in December as his car was swerving around the road. He is set to be disqualified from driving when he is sentenced in May.
