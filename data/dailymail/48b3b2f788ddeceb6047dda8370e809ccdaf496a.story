These pictures might look like they were taken from exotic beaches around the world - but they were in fact taken in Cornwall.

Local photographer Mike Lacey, 28, spends as long as six hours in the water to capture the perfect shot from inside a wave.

Mr Lacey, of Breage near Porthleven, 
said people often mistook his incredible pictures of rolling waves for 
holiday snaps from far-flung locations

around the world.

He said: 'Some of them look like they were taken in Australia or Hawaii, but I think the British coastline is so much nicer.

'People
 who have lived in Cornwall all their life often don't believe the 
pictures are taken on their doorstep until they see some landmarks on 
the

shore.

'I love showing everyone who jets off to Hawaii or the Bahamas the incredible sea we have on our doorstep.'

Mr Lacey, a keen surfer, started 
taking photos from inside the 'tube' of a wave three years ago to show 
non-surfers what they were missing.Â 

He said: 'I wanted to be able to show everyone what it is like out in the waves.

'People who don't surf don't realise that it is so beautiful out in the barrel of a wave looking out at the shore.'

Mr Lacey and his wife Lisa, 31, now run two galleries together selling prints of his work.

After quitting his day job as a wedding 
photographer Mr Lacey opened his first gallery in Porthleven in March 
2013, followed by a second this year.

He said: 'It is pretty fun chasing waves for a living, I work in the best office in the world - the water.

'I wish I could spend every day out there, but I have to run the shop as well.

'Sometimes when it is a particularly nice day and the surf's good I shut up shop and run straight down to the beach.'

Earlier this year huge waves crashed into the Porthleven harbour in Cornwall.
