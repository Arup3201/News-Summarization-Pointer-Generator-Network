The burden of green taxes on businesses has doubled under the Coalition, according to official figures.

The Treasury imposed £2.5billion of levies in 2010-11 – but the takings are predicted to reach £4.6billion in 2015-16, it emerged yesterday.

Business groups have warned the taxes could lead to job losses. There are also fears that more of the costs will be passed on to customers.

A written statement from Treasury minister Priti Patel stated that the Government is 'committed to increasing the proportion of tax revenue accounted for by environmental taxes' to 'encourage positive behaviour change' and make firms cut carbon emissions.

Environment campaigners say such taxes on firms' energy use set an example to other countries and will help tackle climate change – but critics point out that many of them are specific to the UK, which could encourage businesses that use a lot of energy to move abroad.

One cost that has risen substantially over the past five years is the Climate Change Levy, a charge on every kilowatt hour of electricity and gas firms use to generate energy.

Two years ago, another tax – the Carbon Price Floor – was introduced on every ton of carbon that firms emit. These two levies now cost businesses a combined £2billion.

Larger firms have also been hit by the Energy Efficiency Scheme to further reduce carbon emissions. The charge, introduced in 2010, will bring in £800million this year. Another three green taxes – on landfill and mining, and a European levy on carbon – have remained steady since 2010, costing firms £1.8billion a year.

Gareth Stace, of the manufacturers' group EEF, said: 'These figures prove the point that we have been making for some time, namely that UK industry – especially energy-intensive companies – are paying a very heavy price.

'We urgently need to see competitiveness at the heart of energy and climate change policy to place us on a level playing field with even our European competitors who are not facing these bills, let alone the rest of the world. Failure to do this by the next government, if it continues to use carbon taxes as a revenue-raising tool, could only result in lost jobs and investment.'

A Treasury spokesman said: 'This Government is committed to creating a tax system that is simple, fair and creates the right conditions... we have backed businesses with lower taxes overall, cutting corporation tax, giving employers up to £2,000 off their National Insurance bill and giving small high street businesses £1,000 off their business rates.'
