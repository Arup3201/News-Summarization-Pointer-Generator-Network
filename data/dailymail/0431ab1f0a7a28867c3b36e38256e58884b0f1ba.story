Leicester City vs Liverpool (King Power Stadium) 

Team news

Leicester

David Nugent will be assessed ahead of Leicester's clash with Liverpool at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday.

The striker has a sore calf and ankle and is a minor doubt for the rock-bottom Barclays Premier League side.

Dean Hammond has returned to training after a calf injury but is unlikely to be considered. Former England defender Matt Upson is back training but is unavailable as he lacks match-fitness from his lay-off following a foot injury in the summer.

Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, Morgan, Moore, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Drinkwater, James, King, Cambiasso, Albrighton, Mahrez, Knockaert, Vardy, Ulloa, Nugent, Schlupp, Wood, Powell. 

Liverpool 

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is expected to be restored to the starting line-up to face Leicester having been rested at the weekend.

The decision for manager Brendan Rodgers is where to play the midfielder, who has been utilised further forward in his last two appearances with Lucas Leiva having done well in a defensive role.

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Sakho, Enrique, Lucas, Henderson, Allen, Gerrard, Sterling, Lambert, Jones, Manquillo, Lovren, Moreno, Can, Coutinho, Lallana, Markovic, Borini.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) 

Leicester City have lost just one of the last six Barclays Premier League home games against Liverpool (W2 D3 L1).

The Reds have lost four of their last six road trips in the top flight (W2 D0 L4).

The Foxes have won just two of their last 19 Premier League home matches (W2 D12 L5).

Liverpool have kept just one clean sheet in their last 10 Premier League away games.

The Reds have already lost four Premier League away games this term; the same number they lost on the road last season and just one fewer than they suffered in 2012/13, Brendan Rodgers’ first campaign at the helm (5).

Liverpool have not lost three consecutive away league games since April 2012, under Kenny Dalglish.

Only against Wigan (14) has Steven Gerrard played more Premier League games without scoring than he has against the Foxes (6).

Leicester have not failed to score in three consecutive home league games since March 2008, and have not done so in the top-flight since September 1983.

Leonardo Ulloa scored five goals in his first five Premier League appearances, but has failed to score in the eight games since in the competition for the Foxes.

No side has a top scorer with fewer goals than Liverpool (Raheem Sterling, 3 goals) in the Premier League this season (Aston Villa’s and Stoke’s top scorers also have three goals).
