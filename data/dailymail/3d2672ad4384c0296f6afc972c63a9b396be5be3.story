Anne Cole, 71, was driving to hospital when she lost control of her car and ploughed into Hazel l'Anson, who was walking her dog, who was killed

A pensioner who killed a dog walker after suffering a diabetic fit behind the wheel of her car has escaped a prison sentence.

Anne Cole, 71, was driving to a hospital appointment when she had a hypoglycaemic episode, which caused her to lose control of her car and mount a pavement in Leyland, Lancashire.

The retired teacher narrowly missed a tipper truck at a mini roundabout before she ploughed into 51-year-old Hazel l'Anson as she walked her dog Zak in February.

The grandmother and former teaching assistant, who was was hurled into Cole's windscreen before being thrown against a wall, was airlifted to hospital but died later from fatal head and chest injuries.

When Cole, who suffers from Type 2 diabetes was interviewed by police, it emerged she may have been rendered totally incapable to drive due to a lack of blood sugar.

She suffered from autonomic neuropathy which meant she did not have the warning signals to suggest that she was going to have a hypoglycaemic attack and paramedics did not check her blood levels at the time. 

Inquiries also revealed the Toyota Aygo automatic she had been driving was a courtesy car given to her on loan after she was involved in another road accident nine days earlier.

She told Preston Crown Court that she had slowed down as she approached the roundabout 'as I generally do'.

'The next memory I have is being hit, a sense of being moved in one direction. I wasn't going of my own volition. I don't know what happened,' she said.

'All I can say is that it doesn't sound like my driving. I would never hurt anybody. I don't know what to say. It has just destroyed me.' 

Cole has not driven since the crash and has surrendered her driving licence.

She was found guilty of causing death by careless driving and given a three year community order and was banned from driving for two years. 

She was also made subject to an order under Section 22 of the Road Traffic Act declaring her unfit to drive.

However, after the sentencing, Mrs I'Anson's husband David, 60, a truck driver said: 'The sentence is ridiculous and she's not even been financially burdened.

'This medical condition she had has got her away scot-free and she has got off very lightly in my opinion. 

'A community order for a life, for killing a mother and wife, to me is totally wrong. I don't think she realises what she has done.'

'She could have said something to us at court but she just let us walk past. That's the hardest bite, her not showing any remorse. 

Truck driver, David I'Anson, 60, whose wife Hazel was killed in the accident, said the sentence is 'ridiculous'

'She didn't even drop her head and start crying, when she came out I think she wanted to smile'

He added: 'Hazel was the best mother and wife and my soulmate and the first thing I do when I walk through the door is look straight at the photo of her and say "I hope you are in a better place".

'If I could I would buy her back but I'm never going to get her back. This sentence doesn't reflect what has happened when there is a life involved.'

A joint victim statements from Mrs I'Anson's sons Mark and Craig said: 'Life can never be the same again and it is not something we will ever get over, hopefully somehow we will learn to cope without mum. 

'It seems impossible when everything seems to remind us of her.'

Passing sentence Judge Michael Byrne told Cole: 'I make it plain if it were not for the medical condition that you are suffering, a sentence of imprisonment would be appropriate. 

'Everybody no doubt wishes that they could turn the clock back and so undo the terrible tragedy that happened but that is not possible.

'One family has lost a wife and mother through no fault of their own. Another a mother and grandmother held responsible for the events of that day. 

'No sentence can ever compensate for a life lost and no life lost can ever be measured in terms of a sentence whether in prison or not.

'The sole cause of this fatal accident was the careless driving. There was no good reason why she should not have seen the truck in time but failed to do so. Instead she accelerated to try and get ahead of it and in doing so lost control of the vehicle.'

'This unfortunate tragedy may well have been caused by a hypoglycaemic episode, she was unaware she had had at the time.'

The accident, which happened on February 12, 2013, was nine days after another crash where Cole 'overshot' a give way marking and collided with a car whilst on her way to see her daughter. 

There were injuries but her own car was damaged and she was given the automatic Toyota as a courtesy car.

Witnesses to the tragedy said in the moments before the fatal impact Cole was involved in near miss at another mini roundabout where she failed to give way forcing a driver to slam on the brakes.

Motorist, Sean Smith, said: 'She was just staring straight ahead did not make an eye contact - it was like the roundabout wasn't there.'

A judge at Preston Crown Court found Cole guilty and handed her a community order and a driving ban

He then followed her only to see disaster strike at a second roundabout further down the road. 

A 32 tonne tipper truck driver had to brake and sound his horn as Cole drove across in front of him. 

She was then seen to 'put her head down' before her Toyota suddenly accelerated and swerved onto the pavement where Mrs I'Anson had no chance to get out of the way.

Cole initially tried to claim another vehicle had crashed into the right-hand side of her car and knocked her across on to the pavement - but a thorough examination of the Toyota did not show any evidence it had been hit on the side. 

The wagon, which had to brake hard as Cole drove in front of it, had no damage either - and none of four independent witnesses to the accident saw any contact.

It is thought Mrs I'Anson's dog returned home of its own accord after the accident.  

In mitigation defence counsel Miss Rachel Cooper said: 'Had she known she was suffering from this condition she simply would not have been driving. 

'She expresses her remorse and sorrow for what happened. She accepts full responsibility for what happened because she was behind the wheel. 

'It is something she lives with every day but Mrs I'Anson's family carry a heavier burden.'
