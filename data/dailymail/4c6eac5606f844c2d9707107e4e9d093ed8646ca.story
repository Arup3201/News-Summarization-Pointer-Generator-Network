If a picture is worth a thousand words, the messages in these disturbing drawings  are loud and clear.

Asylum seeker and refugee children, aged four to 17, have shared their experiences of being confined within the walls of Australia's detention centres.

The drawings were released ahead the Australian Human Rights Commission's third hearing into the inquiry of detained children, which heard there are 659 children in immigration detention.

One troubling image shows people 'crying in the jail' while a child's parents are pictured committing suicide at Christmas Island.

Another shows a haunting image of a person holding what appears to be a knife dripping with blood with the message: 'I need to go out please. I no wat [sic] to sit in jail. I want to go to school'.

Through these drawings, children are pleading to be released where one child wrote: 'Is there anybody in Australia who can help us? Please help us'.

An inquiry in to the health, well-being and development of children held in Australian detention centres was launched by Commission President Gillian Triggs on February 3.

The head of Immigration Department Secretary Martin Bowles is due to make his first appearance at the inquiry along with other Immigration and Border Protection staff on Thursday

Department of Immigration and Border Protection secretary Martin Bowles told the commission the number of children being held in detention centres in Australia and offshore was 659 in July, 2013.

This was 1330 less than the peak of 1992.

Mr Bowles said the number of children being held at the Christmas Island detention centre was now 153, down by more than 530 in the past year.

Some of those children had been transferred to Nauru, where there were now 185 children being held.

Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) president Gillian Triggs asked Mr Bowles if he was being 'straight forward with the Australian public' in stating numbers on Christmas Island were being reduced if children had simply been transferred to Nauru.

Mr Bowles responded that there had been a 'significant and considerable decrease' in numbers of children being held.

'I reject the imputation that we are either misleading or lying to anybody in relation to the reduction of children in detention,' he told the inquiry in Sydney on Thursday.

The commission heard there are about 37 children among the 157 Sri Lankan asylum seekers recently transferred to the Curtin detention centre in Western Australia.

Counsel assisting the inquiry Naomi Sharp asked Mr Bowles if he could confirm there were babies among those children.

Mr Bowles that he could not confirm there were babies without having confirmed the "biodata" from assessment of the group, but said there were small children.

In a statement to the inquiry Mr Bowles rejected claims made in the media about poor health care standards at the Christmas Island detention centre, saying the claims 'offend greatly' staff working at the centre.

Mr Bowles said healthcare services on Christmas Island were 'commensurate with those available to the Australian community'.

Mr Bowles said he would make no comments on Nauru as the scope of the commission extended only to onshore detention centres.

The AHRC national inquiry into the health and well-being of children in immigration detention continues.

Prof Triggs announced that Immigration Minister Scott Morrison had agreed to appear before the inquiry.

She said Mr Morrison had declined to appear on Thursday because of the current legal proceedings surrounding the 157 Sri Lankan asylum seekers.

No date has yet been set for the minister's appearance.

A spokeswoman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the government would cooperate with the inquiry.

'More importantly the government will continue to reduce the number of children in detention as we have been doing since the day we were elected,' she said.

The number of children in detention had fallen by almost 35 per cent since the September election.
