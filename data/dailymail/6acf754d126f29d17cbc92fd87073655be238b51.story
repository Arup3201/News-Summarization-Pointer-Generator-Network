A firefighter started blazes himself in a bid to save his local closure-threatened fire station from being shut down, a court heard.

Richard Naughton set fire to set fire to recycling skips in Knighton, Powys, Wales, to increase the number of call outs.

A court heard the 33-year-old wanted to make the Knighton fire station - which had been threatened with closure - appear to be more viable.

Naughton, of Knighton, admitted two charges of arson at a previous hearing in November last year.

And JPs sentenced him to a 12-month community order with a positive skills course and 90 hours of unpaid work at Llandrindod Wells Magistrates' Court.

Naughton was also ordered to pay £330 compensation to Powys County Council for damage to a skip, £225 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

Sentencing him, chairman of the bench Richard Doyland said: 'This is a serious crime and you must pay back the community.'

The court heard he admitted committing arson by damaging skips belonging to Knighton Recycling Centre on November 11 and November 18 last year.

Magistrates were also told mechanic Naughton had been a retained firefighter for seven years but has since resigned.

Defending him in court, Colonel Tim Van Rees said he had 'acted thoroughly stupid, though with good intentions.'

He added: 'He loved serving his community and now he has resigned and he won’t be able to again.'
