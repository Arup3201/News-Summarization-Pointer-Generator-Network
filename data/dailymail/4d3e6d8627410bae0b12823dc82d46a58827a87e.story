Apple's iPhone is already a 'games console' for many of its users - the average iPhone owner plays games for 14.7 hours a month, according to a Nielsen study.

But a new app will ensure they have more to play than Angry Birds.

The key? The 3D, hi-def games - including hits such as Assassin's Creed: Revelations - aren't actually playing ON your phone or tablet's slow processor - they're playing elsewhere, and the video streams to iPad, iPhone or Android devices courtesy of the new Onlive app.

The new Onlive app allows users to play games that iPad's processor simply wouldn't be capable of such as Lego: Batman - streaming the video from high-powered servers, and adding touch controls to the 'console quality' games

The app adds an 'overlay' of touch controls to console games, making them easier to use on iPad

The app itself is free - but a subscription of £6.99 buys you access to a library of 150 games. Renting a game for three days costs £3.99.

'Buying' a game outright costs similar prices to what it would cost in the shops - for instance Assassin's Creed: Revelation is £39.99.

The app comes with two free games - the crime thriller L.A. Noire, and Lego Batman.

So far, 25 games have been adapted for touchscreen controls.

Current PC and console hits such as Assassin's Creed Revelations are available either for a one-off payment or via a subcription of £6.99 a month

Even when 'renting' games via the app, the app counts up your rentals and once you've 'paid' for the game, you keep it

There are 500 million mobile devices in the U.S. and UK capable of using the app. In the UK, the service only works over wi-fi. In the U.S., 4G mobiles will also be able to use the service.

L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games and family titles like LEGO: Batman will be given free to anyone who downloads the OnLive app.

There is also an upcoming wireless controller (£39.99/$49.99) which works with many tablets and phones - overcoming one of gaming's major hurdles on the platforms, the fact that touchscreen controls rarely work on action games.

Only 25 games have been optimised for touchscreen control so far - but you can buy a £39.99 controller which works with most phones and tablets

'Today marks a major milestone: OnLive is now delivering the latest, console-class, top-tier games—literally to your fingertips—on mobile tablets and phones for instant on-demand play anywhere, anytime,' said Steve Perlman, OnLive Founder and CEO.

'Through the free OnLive app, tablet and smartphone gamers can play top console and PC titles like Assassins Creed: Revelations and L.A. Noire—one of the most highly acclaimed, graphically sophisticated games to date—with exclusive OnLive Cloud Touch controls or with the new mobile-compatible OnLive Wireless Controller.

'Tablets and smartphones, the fastest-growing consumer product categories in history, are now capable of running the hottest, highest-end games. Gaming and mobile devices will never be the same.'

There are 500 million devices in the U.S. and the UK capable of running the free app

Most of the nearly 200 games in OnLive's growing library, including recent top-tier releases like Batman: Arkham City, Assassin’s Creed: Revelations and Lord of the Rings: War in the North, are immediately playable on virtually any device with the OnLive Wireless Controller, which automatically find wireless connection for any tablet, smartphone, PC, Mac, TV or Blu-ray player. 'As always, any game purchased on one OnLive app device (TV, PC, Mac or mobile device) can be played instantly on any other OnLive app device with full cloud save game data intact, allowing users to start play on one device, and continue playing on any other device, whenever and wherever they want.  OnLive’s cross-platform capability extends to multiplayer gaming, enabling, for example, a tablet gamer to play with TV, PC, Mac and smartphone gamers,' said a spokeserson.
