The racist yob who abused Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck with a monkey gesture has been named by outraged football fans as Gavin Kirkham.

As of early on Friday morning no arrest had been made following his disgraceful actions during Chelsea’s 5-4 win in the Capital One Cup clash at Stamford Bridge.

Kirkham, 28, was pictured making an obscene gesture at Welbeck from the Matthew Harding Stand, triggering yet another police investigation at the club yesterday.

Disgusted football fans took to Twitter to publicly name the fan, from Letchworth Garden City in Hertfordshire, who was sitting in the front row during Sunday’s league game with Manchester United.

Football fans called for the fan to be banned for life after the alleged monkey gesture and branded him an 'idiot'.

Kirkham could not be reached for 
comment but told The Sun he had not been contacted by police and had 
nothing to say because he is 'busy trying to earn a living'. He lists his pastimes on Facebook as Chelsea, playing football and drinking, the paper reported.

Paul Kearns, of Show Racism the Red Card, told the newspaper: 'We are incensed by this fan's actions - as much of the football community appear to be.'

The monkey gesture was particularly 
embarrassing for Chelsea after they went to great lengths to remind 
supporters that safety and respectful behaviour is paramount.

Chelsea, who had pleaded with 
supporters to identify the culprit — who was sat in row one of the stand
 — are already on the back foot over another racism incident, after 
alleging that referee Mark Clattenburg called John Mikel Obi a ‘monkey’ 
in the league match with United.

Chelsea had said they would ban the individual for life when he was eventually identified.

A Chelsea spokesman said: ‘Chelsea 
are committed to removing all forms of discrimination and if we have 
sufficient evidence we will take the strongest possible action, 
including supporting criminal prosecution.’

Manchester United say they will 
'monitor the situation closely' after the Chelsea supporter appeared to 
make a monkey gesture at striker Danny Welbeck.

Police
 are investigating after the fan was caught on camera apparently aiming 
the racist taunt at Welbeck during the Capital One Cup clash at Stamford
 Bridge.

Chelsea say 
they will examine TV footage and will take the strongest possible action
 against the fan if there is enough evidence.

A United spokesman said: 'It is a matter for Chelsea and the police but we will monitor the situation closely.'

Football fans clamoured to say that the alleged gesture was disgusting and yobbish behaviour

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said:
 'Police have received a complaint regarding alleged racist behaviour at
 Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.

'An investigation has been launched. There have been no arrests and enquiries continue.'

A Chelsea spokesman said: 'If we have
 sufficient evidence we will take the strongest possible action, 
including supporting criminal prosecution.'

Chelsea are under siege after a 
series of racism rows.

The incident came just days after 
Chelsea accused referee Mark Clattenburg of using 'inappropriate 
language' towards midfielder John Mikel Obi in Sunday's Premier League 
match against United.

They have made a formal complaint to the FA against Clattenburg.

Message: Manchester United fans take aim at Chelsea over the race rows that have engulfed the club

Earlier this year, Chelsea imposed a lifetime ban on a supporter who admitted racially abusing former striker Didier Drogba.

The club's captain, John Terry, is 
currently serving a four-match ban after being found guilty by the FA of
 racially abusing QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, brother of United star 
Rio.

Longsight-raised Welbeck, the son of Ghanian parents, has risen through the ranks at Old Trafford.

He played for England at the European Championships this summer and scored in the victory over Sweden.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger criticised them 
for publicising their complaint against Clattenburg.

Wenger, however, believes any dispute should have been settled immediately after the match or behind closed doors.

The Frenchman repeatedly hit out at 
Chelsea’s decision to ‘go public’ with their allegations and insisted 
such matters should remain private.

Chelsea dropped their second 
allegation against Clattenburg after an external legal team warned them 
that their claim he called Juan Mata ‘a Spanish t***’ would not stand up
 before an FA commission.

The club appeared robust and confident of 
success, however, in their pursuit of Clattenburg over claims he called 
Mikel a ‘monkey’.

Mikel only discovered the allegation 
when he entered the dressing room last Sunday in a conversation with 
Ramires. Mikel then attempted to kick down Clattenburg’s door before he 
confronted the official.
