A disgruntled Younis Khan is ready to stop playing test cricket until the World Cup after being dropped for Pakistan's one-day international series against Australia.

Last month, Younis played one ODI against Sri Lanka in his comeback to limited-overs cricket after 17 months out, then flew back home due to a death in the family.

Chief selector Moin Khan said at the squad announcement this week that he was looking to the future in replacing Younis, a veteran of 254 ODIs, with Umar Amin for the three ODIs against Australia next month in the United Arab Emirates.

But Younis says, 'What should players like us do? Should we shoot ourselves?'

Younis also was ready to sacrifice his test career.

He says, 'Don't consider me for ODIs and test matches (until the World Cup) ... but if this team doesn't get set, then those who are talking, will they leave?'
