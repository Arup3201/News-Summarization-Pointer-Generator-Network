Luis Enrique's new era at Barcelona is underway and Gerard
Deulofeu showed why he may have a big part to play in it.

The 20-year-old is likely to get some opportunities to play
alongside Lionel Messi at the start of the season, unless Luis Suarez's
four-month ban is revoked.

In that time he will be aiming to impress enough to be a
real alternative for Enrique and his quest began on Saturday night when he
helped Barcelona win the Trofeo Colombino.

Recreativo: Sotres, Victor Díaz (Corcoles 46), Menosse (Zamora 46), Juanan (Vega 46), Tono, Koke (Dimas 46), Jesús Vazquez (Blati 46), Montoro (Zambrano 46), Joselu (Molina 46), Jorge Larena (Garcia 46), Nunez (Quintana 46).

Booked: Dimas.

Barcelona: Masip (Ter Stegen 46); Montoya (Patric 46), Edgar Ie (Diagne 46), Bagnack (Bartra 46), Grimaldo (Lucas 46); Halilovic (Samper 46), Sergi Roberto (Joan Roman 46), Babunski (Camara 46, (Dongou 70)); Munir (Deulofeu 46), Adama (Sandro 46), Nieto (Afellay 46).Goal: Joan Roman 66.

It was Deulofeu's low strike which was parried by Dani
Sotres to the waiting Joan Roman, who gleefully turned it home from close-range
to net the first goal of Enrique's reign. 

Deulofeu had beaten two men with a quick dribble before
making some space for his shot, showing he has the attributes to unlock the
defences that so readily retreat into their own box against Barcelona.

With two minutes to go he could have scored himself, lashing
the ball past Sotres from a tight angle, but seeing it come crashing back off
the crossbar. 

There was a modicum of pressure to perform on his shoulders,
after he was spotted earlier in the week mocking a Cristiano Ronaldo goal
celebration.

Elements of his game are similar to the Real Madrid star's,
with the forward, on loan at Everton last season, offering plenty of
stepovers. 

He also lured Dimas Delgado into an ungainly lunge, hacking
down Deulofeu and ending up in the referee's notebook.

In the 50th edition of the Trofeo Colombino, a tournament
set up by Recreativo Huelva to commemorate their position as Spain's oldest
club, Barcelona were worthy winners.

This game marked Huelva's 125th anniversary, but they could
not do themselves justice with Enrique's side firmly in control in the
Andalusian heat. 

Although the game featured plenty of youth players there
were a few hints of what was to follow from Enrique.

The team played a more fluid style than last season, with
less of the diagonal, longer balls that Tata Martino favoured.

In the first half Croatian starlet Alen Halilovic was the
best player on show.

Barcelona fought off interest from Real Madrid, Arsenal and
Tottenham to secure their man and we saw why, with his fantastic technique
obvious from the start.

There are shades of Luka Modric about Halilovic, but he
plays with a more aggressive attacking style. 

One superbly hit half-volley from the edge of the box forced
Sotres into a smart save at his near post, and another clever nutmeg had the
crowd purring. 

With Halilovic pulling the strings in midfield and Adama
Traore's direct running worrying the Huelva defence, Barcelona looked in fine
fettle. 

Goalkeeper Jordi Masip had a couple of shaky moments early
on with some poor kicks, which he will not be pleased with, given Enrique's
words about giving him a chance.

The manager said that even though Marc-Andre ter Stegen and
Claudio Bravo had been signed, all three goalkeepers would start the season on
an even footing.

Bravo is still on holiday after his World Cup exertions with
Chile, but the German came on at half-time and was solid.

While he did not have any saves to make, he was quick off
his line and showed good control on the ball. 

Another impressive performer was the Dutchman Ibrahim
Afellay, who may not have a role to play at Barcelona this season.

Rafinha and Adriano were injured and not part of the squad,
while Bojan was not selected - perhaps an indication he has a move away lined
up. 

Sergi Roberto, who recently signed a new contract, captained
the side entirely composed of La Masia graduates.

It was all-change after the break, with 11 players brought
on at half-time, including Deulofeu and Afellay.

Deulofeu will hope this was the start of things to come and,
with Barcelona lifting silverware at the end of the match, so will
Enrique.
