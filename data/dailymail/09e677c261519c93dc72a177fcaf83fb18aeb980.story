A Sydney comedy act has done their own take on the latest Old Spice commercial by throwing some Bondi hipster wannabes into the mix of a hilarious satirical song.

Local guys, known as Dom and Adrian, who actually call themselves - The Bondi Hipsters - have released their own version of the original ad called ‘Mom Song’ which is a parody on a mother's apparent struggle when her son changes from a boy to a man.

’Man Song’, which was released on Thursday by the guys who regularly create parodies about stereoptypical Bondi types, is an amusing song about a son breaking the news to his mother that he is moving out of the nest egg and into a Bondi apartment with his mate.

Dom takes Adrian along for moral support and together they let his mother down ‘gently’ by telling her that he is a ‘mahn’ now because Old Spice has made his beard grow quicker, his chest hair thicker and his triceps bigger.

Dom is a 'mahn' now because Old Spice has made his beard grow quicker, his chest hair thicker and his triceps bigger

It's time to move out when you can make your own lunches and tie your own knots

A quick headbanging session ensued after they declare 'I've even got my own Medicare card' and he's had to 'use it twice because we party so hard'

‘Yar hes an independent self-sufficient mahn,’  Adrian croons to Dom's mum while tinkering on the piano in the lounge room.

The guys explain that he is ready for manhood now that he can pack his own lunch and tie his own knots – not to mention that he’s ‘got a cool leather wallet and Swiss made watch’.

A quick headbanging session ensues after they declare 'I've even got my own Medicare card'and he's had to 'use it twice because we party so hard.'

Adrian then announces to Dom's mother while knocking over a photo frame of the two of them:

'Sorry but Dom doesn’t need you anymore. He's moving in with me so sorry about that dot com,' as they start to pack up his belongings.

'Yar hes an independent self-sufficient mahn,' Adrian says to Dom's mum while tinkering on the piano in their  lounge room

He doesn't need to live with his mother now thanks to Old Spice providing him with manliness

But don't worry mum - 'you will still see my face because I'm turning my old room into a storage space'

Dom also makes worthy note of Ashley -  the love of his life who he met when they 'both swiped right' - referring to online dating site Tinder.

And just in case his mother wasn't sure where all of his manliness had come from - they give her a quick run-down.

But Adrian comforted his mum with the fact that 'you will still see my face because I'm turning my old room into a storage space'.

As the guys were carrying his stuff out of the door the son ends their cheery tune with 'can you lend me some money, can you help me find my keys and give us a lift to Bondi please?'

Needless to say, they were last seen juggling all of the belonging on their bicycles.

'Sorry but Dom doesn't need you anymore. He's moving in with me so sorry about that dot com'

'Can you lend me some money, can you help me find my keys and give us a lift to Bondi please?'

Needless to say the very poker-faced mother sends them off on their bikes
