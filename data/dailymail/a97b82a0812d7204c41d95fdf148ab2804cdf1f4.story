John Obi Mikel has accused Arsenal's Olivier Giroud of elbowing him - and expressed his astonishment that referee Mark Geiger did not send him off.

The Chelsea midfielder, whose Nigeria team lost 2-0 to France in the World Cup last 16 on Monday night was caught by Giroud on 29 minutes.

And though referee Geiger appeared to see the foul, he failed to take any action.

Mikel said: 'Yes I got an elbow and the referee saw it and he only gave him a warning, not even a yellow card, nothing. It was bad. We know the game – if you see it, act on it.

'The ref saw it. He did catch me, I don't know if it was too hard but the intention was definitely there. I don't think he is a dirty player. Everyone wants to win for his country. He hasn't done those sort of things before so maybe it was just one of those things in the heat of the moment

Nigeria were also upset at a succession of challenges on midfielder Ogenyi Onazi, which resulted in the Nigerian being carried of on 59 minutes after a challenge from Blaise Matuidi.

'I thought the referee didn't help us,' said Mikel. 'There were some heavy challenges and I think Ogenyi Onazi has broken his ankle. Challenges like this are bad but it was a 50-50, he just miscaculated, he is not a dirty player.'

Giroud may yet find himself the subject of FIFA disciplinary action and a ban from the quarter final on the basis of video evidence.

But the Arsenal striker endured a difficult afternoon, being withdrawn on 62 minutes and seeing his replacement Antione Griezmann help to change the game, as France struck with two late goals
