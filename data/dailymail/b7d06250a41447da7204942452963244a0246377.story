White House gatecrasher and reality TV star Tareq Salahi has filed for divorce today citing adultery and abandonment.

His wife, Real Housewives of D.C star MIchaele, ran off with Journey guitarist Neal Schon earlier this week.

And in bizarre twist, Tareq claims his love rival taunted him with a lewd picture.

In legal documents obtained by TMZ today, he alleged: 'The paramour [Neal] sent to my email account... a email with an attachment of a penis.'

Tareq claims his wife has been having an affair for 'several months', adding: 'She continually exposes our friends and acquaintances to her adulterous relationship and has flaunted the same throughout the community, the nation and indeed the world, and thus caused me to suffer great harm, humiliation and embarrassment.'

The pair are understood to have a pre-nuptial agreement.

Tareq was once friendly with the rocker and his band Journey, however he has now been banned from gaining access to the group's tour.

An unearthed photograph shows the love rivals arm-in-arm, as 
Michaele smiles slyly on the other side of them. It was taken after one of the band's concerts.

Mrs Salahi first met Schon on 1995 and the pair felt an instant attraction, reported U.S. website TMZ.

They allegedly embarked on a sexual affair as early as in 2009, which the Journey musician even bragged about to friends via e-mail.

A second photo predicts the 
direction that their friendship was destined to take, as Michaele, 45, 
sits comfortably on her future lover's knee with his arms wrapped 
tightly around her.

After allegedly hiding the affair for two years, the illicit couple threw caution to the wind earlier this week as Michaele jumped ship from her marriage into the Schon's arms - and onto the Journey tour bus.

A confused Tareq reported his wife missing after she didn't return from a hair appointment and a dance class, and even alerted the alarm that she had been kidnapped.Â 

But deputies at the local authorities told Tareq that his wife had previously contacted them to inform them that she was okay.

She had told them she was 'dealing with family issues and was safe.'

However, it soon emerged that Mrs Salahi was with Schon after going to his show in Nashville.

The reality star is now said to be in Memphis with Schon as he continues his U.S tour.

'Mrs. Salahi said she did not want Mr Salahi to know where she was,' said police in Warren County, Virginia, in a statement.

'She seemed calm, was engaged in conversation and assured the deputy that she had left the residence with a good friend and was where she wanted to be.

She advised she did not want to be home right now.'

Naturally humiliated, Tareq plans to divorce his cheating souse, according to a report on TMZ.

Tareq
is telling friends he can never trust Michaele again and will never 
take her back, even though he believes she'll eventually tire of Neal 
and try to come back to him.

The shunned husband has reportedly already changed the locks on their family

The
Salahis rose to notoriety after it was revealed they had gatecrashed a 
White House party attended by President Barack Obama.

The couple mingled with VIPs as Mr 
Obama and his wife, Michelle, welcomed guests to the dinner honouring 
Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh.

Their
antics were only discovered when they posted photographs of themselves 
hobnobbing with Washington's elite on their Facebook page causing major 
embarrassment to the President's security team.
