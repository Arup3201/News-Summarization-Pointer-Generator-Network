Chancellor George Osborne, pictured on a building site, made the house buying scheme a central plank of his Budget

Plans to offer state-backed mortgages were mired in confusion last night over whether they could be used by the wealthy to buy  second homes.

The Chancellor said the £130billion scheme was a 'big new step' that would help hundreds of thousands of families buy their own home or move home as their family grows.

But it came under fire after it emerged wealthy homeowners may be able to use it to buy second homes costing up to £600,000.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls dubbed it a 'spare homes subsidy' for the rich.

And the Campaign to Protect Rural England warned subsidising second homes could push house prices out of the reach of locals in areas like Cornwall and the Lake District.

CPRE spokesman Claire Norman said: 'We doubt the Chancellor intends the scheme to be used for second homes, but if it is legal and possible, what would stop people?'

Experts also warned the scheme could spark a house price boom, with the taxpayer picking up the bill in the subsequent crash.

Mr Osborne and Business Secretary Vince Cable both ducked questions yesterday about whether people would be able to use the scheme to buy second homes.

They insisted the aim was to help finance main homes, but said details would only be finalised following talks with the housing industry.

Mr Osborne said: 'This is a big new step for the UK, and we are going to consult on the details. The mortgage market is an extremely complex thing.

'The intention of the scheme is absolutely clear – it is for people who want to get their first home, or people who have a home and want to move to a bigger home because they've perhaps got a bigger family.'

He added: 'If we were in a housing boom then this is not the kind of intervention you would take. But actually our housing market is not properly functioning at the moment.'

To promote his plans, Mr Osborne visited a Berkeley Homes Royal Arsenal Riverside development in Woolwich, south east London

Mr Osborne also met Rick Newton and Emily Sandercock who have recently bought an apartment at a development in Woolwich, south east London

Mr Cable said the consultation 
'recognises the fact that in the mortgage market there are many complex 
products, for example many parents support their children's housing 
acquisition. That kind of transaction has to be properly analysed before
this scheme is launched.'

The Treasury yesterday made clear people would not be able to use the Help to Buy scheme to purchase buy-to-let properties.

But Treasury sources said banning 
existing homeowners from the scheme would penalise many who need help, 
such as children who need support from parents to buy a home, divorcing 
couples, and families who temporarily rent a home they cannot sell.

Dangerous? Critics fear that offering government-back mortgages to people who cannot afford a deposit could fuel a new property crisis

Chancellor George Osborne is expected to unveil more help for homebuyers and extra investment in housebuilding

The mortgage guarantee part of Help to Buy will underwrite £130billion of mortgages on any property worth up to £600,000.

It will be available for mortgages of 
between 80 and 95 per cent of a home's value.

So for someone able to 
muster a 5 per cent deposit, the Government would put in 15 per cent, to
enable them to access an 80 per cent loan.

If a borrower's property is repossessed, the Government will bear part of the losses.

A second, 'shared equity', part of the
scheme will offer loans worth up to 20 per cent of a home's value. The 
scheme, worth £3.5billion, will be rolled out next month.

Former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling warned there was a danger the larger scheme could fuel another price boom.

He said: 'The risk is that you simply 
inflate house prices and you could even get into some of the problems 
you have seen with sub-prime.'

Example: The proposed scheme is split into two separate streams, the first (above) for buyers purchasing new build homes and the second (below) for everyone else

Changes: The government offered more backing for housebuilding, after figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a sharp drop in output from the construction industry 

Sea change: Ministers believe cash-strapped second-steppers are holding up the housing market, and making it harder for first-time buyers to get on to the property ladder

Can I buy a house using Help to Buy?

If you have a 5% deposit and want to buy a new build home, you’ll be able to access the Help to Buy: equity loan scheme from 1 April 2013. If you want to buy a property which is either new build or an existing property, the Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee will be available from January 2014.

What if I don’t have a deposit – can I still get a mortgage?

To access a Help to Buy product, buyers will need a minimum 5% deposit.

Am I guaranteed to get a mortgage? Are there any criteria I need to meet?

For both schemes, borrowers will need to meet appropriate tests to ensure they can pay back the mortgage, as well passing their chosen lender’s credit and affordability checks.

How much can I borrow?

Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and affordability checks, you’ll be able to use either Help to Buy scheme to purchase a property with a value up to £600,000.

Can existing homeowners access the scheme?

Yes. Both schemes are available to home movers as well as first-time-buyers, subject to meeting the relevant eligibility criteria.

Can I get an interest only mortgage using Help to Buy?

Help to Buy is only available on capital repayment mortgages.

Can I buy a property using Help to Buy and rent it out?

Help to Buy will only be available on properties which are occupied by the individual or individuals taking out the mortgage.

How do I go about accessing these schemes?

Help to Buy: equity loan will be available from 1 April 2013. Buyers will be able to access this through participating housebuilders and HomeBuy agents.

Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee will be available from January 2014. The Government will provide further details about the scheme later in the year.

Will the Government be guaranteeing my mortgage payments for me?

No. The Government will provide guarantees to lenders on a proportion of the mortgage. If a borrower’s property is repossessed, the Government will cover a proportion of the losses suffered by lenders.
