The captain of the Costa Concordia said 'everything is much safer' on cruise ships than when the Titanic sank a century ago in a newspaper interview a year before the disaster.

Francesco Schettino, 52, faces court action over the accident which left six people dead and a further 29 still missing.

The captain told a journalist at the Czech paper Dnes that the risk of a modern disaster was much lower because of safety systems that had been put in place.

But he added: 'I wouldn't like to be in the role of the captain of the Titanic, having to sail in an ocean of icebergs.'

However, when pressed on the impact of the 1912 disaster and the long-term impact it had on shipping, he responded: Luckily, people forget about tragedies'.

The £400million liner which crashed, with 4,200 passengers and crew, was sailing just 300 yards from the island’s rocky coast when it should have been at least four miles out to sea.

Following the accident thousands have taken to Facebook to vent their fury at the so-called ‘Captain Coward’, who is now claimed to have ‘skimmed’ past the Tuscan isle of Giglio not just to salute a retired officer but also to impress his head waiter’s family on shore.

After the collision there was allegedly a delay of more than 30 minutes before the coastguard knew about it.

The first the authorities heard of the accident was when they were alerted by passengers on the ship.

Captain Schettino told the newspaper in his interview 13 months ago that the risk of a cruise ship accident was much reduced in the 21st century.

'These days, everything is much safer. It is easier to navigate thanks to modern technical instruments and the internet,' he said.

'If an error occurs, it is not so serious, because we are better prepared for possible complications.

'Using the internet we know straightaway the weather conditions and the situation that we'll find in the ports that we are heading to. And it's easy to take important decisions.'

He added that he enjoyed the unpredictable and liked to face a challenge when in control of a cruise ship.

'I enjoy moments when something unpredictable happens, when you can diverge a bit from standard procedures. It's a challenge to face, I enjoy it,' he said.

After swiftly escaping from the Concordia quickly after Friday's accident, Captain Schettino was arrested along with first officer Ciro Ambrosio.

The captain was spotted wrapped in a blanket on his way to the shore at around 11.30pm – more than four hours before the evacuation of the vessel was completed and breaking the maritime tradition of remaining with his ship.

Coastguards are said to have told him to ‘get back on board your vessel’ once they realised he was safe on the island but he failed to do so.

In the December 2010 newspaper 
interview he stressed that he was 'constantly vigilant' and said 'every 
moment on a ship is important to me' and he had never been in a 
dangerous situation.

The
Daily Telegraph reported that he added: 'I think that's down to the 
fact that I prepare myself every day of the voyage. I have to be 
constantly vigilant.

'I believe that with thorough preparation we are able to keep any situation under control.'

Captain Schettino has been skipper of the Costa Concordia for the last six years. He has a wife and a daughter.

Preventing pollution in the sea surrounding the sunken Costa Concordia will be a 'race against time', but the ship could be sailing again in future with a lot of hard work and a lot of money, according to a maritime expert.

Malcolm Latarche, editor of IHS Fairplay Solutions, says that although the ship's tanks are in protected locations, there may be 'some small spillage' from the 17 tanks, which contain a total of 500,000 gallons of fuel, because of the current position of the cruise liner.

He also says that while holidaymakers may not be rushing to book themselves a cabin on the luxury ship, it is possible that Concordia could be repaired and back in service some time in 2013.

'It would take an awful lot of work and a lot of money. It would be a year at least before it would be in a serviceable condition and the question is would anybody really want to go on it?

'Would you go on a ship that has been in that condition? Would you think it was unlucky or what? It'll always be a hard sell to get people to go on it, that's my opinion,' said Mr Latarche.

He said that pollution was something the shipping industry dreaded the most.

'It is an issue, it's always an issue in these cases. It's what we in the industry hate to see because the pollution aspect of oil, and when you see oil tankers go aground, more than anything else, puts public opinion against the shipping industry,' he said.

The maritime expert added: 'The longer it sits there...the waves are very very forceful. A powerful force is acting on the ship.

'A ship is designed to float, it's not designed to be sat on the bottom so while it's pushed about and prodded, and kicked around by the wind and waves, stresses will come on it and wells will crack.'

However, he did add that although preventing pollution from a spillage would be hard work and 'not the easiest job in the world', it would not be 'rocket science'.

The ship's operator, Costa Crociere, has enlisted Smit of Rotterdam, one of the world's biggest salvagers, to handle the removal of the 290-metre cruise liner.

Yesterday he said on Italian television he did not understand why the ship had hit the rocks.

'Even though we were sailing along the coast with the tourist navigation system, I firmly believe the rocks weren't detected,' he said.'The ship wasn't heading forward but sideways as if under water there was this rock projection.

'I don't know if it was detected or not, but on the nautical chart it was marked just as water and some 100-150 metres (330ft-500ft) from the rocks, and we were about 300 metres from the shore, more or less.

'We shouldn't have had this contact.'

A dancer who helped to direct petrified passengers off the ship said yesterday the instruction to abandon ship should have been given 'an hour earlier, if not more'.

James Thomas, 19, had been working as an entertainer on the cruise liner for six months when it ran aground in the Mediterranean.

He said: 'We started to lean to the port side... it got more and more dramatic and everyone seemed to know that it wasn't just a normal turn, we were turning unbelievably sharply.

'I was thrown out of bed and then as I stood there all my aftershave and a bottle of wine came towards me as I was catching things and smashed on my foot.'

The teenager said an announcement over the ship's intercom system urged passengers to stay calm and assured them that there was simply a 'minor technical fault'. But a coded series of beeps was sounded to let crew know that there was a leak on board.

Mr Thomas, from Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, said: 'We had an announcement saying please stay calm, everything is under control, it's just a minor technical fault.

'Then we had the coding of two short blasts followed by alternate tones which means there is a leak on board and so the crew were divided, very much so.

'A lot of people said, 'no just tell everyone to stay calm, that's what we've been told to say'.

'But then other people took the initiative and said, "Okay, let's tell everyone to stay calm but hand over life jackets".'

Mr Thomas said he put on warm clothes and a life jacket before making his way to a pre-arranged meeting point, helping passengers along the way.

He said: 'We thought it was a "just in case" scenario but then we started to lift and started to tilt and we knew something was deadly wrong.

'We knew we were going to have to do something drastic to get out of the situation we were in.'
