Real Madrid's 22-game winning streak in all competitions came to an end at Valencia on Sunday but perhaps that is unsurprising giving the deadly finishing of Los Che's players during a training session prior to the match.

On-loan striker Alvaro Negredo proved his predatory instincts are strong as ever with an outrageous effort that manages to find the back of the net.

Shooting from behind the goal, the Spain international curled  a strike into the far corner of the net with one bounce of the ball aiding him.

The 29-year-old, on loan from Premier League champions Manchester City, was clearly delighted with his moment of genius as he walked off in celebration.

And clearly Negredo's team-mates took note with some clinical finishing of their own as they toppled La Liga leaders Real 2-1 at the Mestalla on Sunday evening.

Goals from Antonio Barragan Fernandez and Nicolas Otamendi saw the hosts come from behind to win after Cristiano Ronaldo had given Carlo Ancelotti's side the lead.

Victory for Valencia moves them onto 34 points after 17 games - five behind Real who have a game in hand.
