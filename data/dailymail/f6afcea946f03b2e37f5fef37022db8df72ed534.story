Thug: Kerry Ozouf has been jailed for attacking her elderly neighbour after years of terrorising the local area with her anti-social behaviour

A neighbour from hell has been jailed after she assaulted a 92-year-old while screaming at her victim, 'die, you old woman!'

Kerry Ozouf attacked her next-door neighbour Irene Bell after the elderly woman threatened to call the police following a string of anti-social behaviour.

But after serving her five-month sentence, Ozouf, 38, will be allowed to return to the area she has long been terrorising - because the council says it does not want to 'move the problem elsewhere'.

The assault on June 22 last year began when Ozouf was having a screaming row with her boyfriend in her front garden in Boscombe, a suburb of Bournemouth in Dorset.

Mrs Bell, now 93, said she would call the police - prompting her neighbour to hit her from behind and knock her to the floor.

The thug called her victim a 'cow' and shouted, 'Die you old woman, you shouldn't be here, die!' as she continued to beat her.

Ozouf later claimed that Mrs Bell had provoked her by calling her a 'dirty old prostitute' - but the prosecution rejected this allegation.

The victim, a former school matron who has lived in the same flat for 34 years, suffered a fractured elbow, cuts, bruises and swelling to her head in the attack, and now finds it harder to walk.

Speaking after Ozouf was jailed, Mrs Bell said: 'They had been rowing all day. I told them, "If you don't pack this in I will have to ring the police." I got a lot of back-chat from her.

'They still didn't stop and eventually I went out again and told them I was going to call the police. Another neighbour had come out to speak to them so I went to go back inside.

'For no reason she followed me along the path and jumped on me, pushing me to the floor. She jumped on me so suddenly, I didn't know what had happened. It was like someone had dropped a sack of stones on me.

'She was hitting me with her fists. She was on top of me and her hands were in my hair, pulling my head up and down. She went beyond herself, as if she didn't know what she was doing.

'My neighbours came to help and got her off me and I can't remember much after that because I was in complete shock. My legs were black and blue and my head was swollen for days.

'Before this I used to walk into Boscombe centre and back but now I can only get to the local shops here - I have got no balance at all.

'I have been here 34 years, it was a beautiful area to live until she moved in. I'm very worried about her coming back.'

Ozouf, who suffers from drink and drug problems, pleaded guilty to assault by beating at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court last year.

As well as being sentenced to five months in prison, she is banned from contacting Mrs Bell for at least three years.

Neighbour Jacquie Carmichael, 68, said that Ozouf had made residents' lives miserable with her loud noise, swearing and anti-social behaviour.

'She seemed nice when she first came here, but she has been awful since,' Mrs Carmichael said. 'She has fallen out with everybody over something.'

More than two dozen locals have signed a petition calling for Ozouf to be removed from her flat, but council bosses claim that would only 'move the problem elsewhere'.

A spokesman said: said: 'Shortly after this incident the council took legal action against one of its tenants to prevent this or similar behaviour reoccurring.

'In future any tenant, or a family member or visitor, convicted of such offences near their home would be subject to a mandatory possession order.'
