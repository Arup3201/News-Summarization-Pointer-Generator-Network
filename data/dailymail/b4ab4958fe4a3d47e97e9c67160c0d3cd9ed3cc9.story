From undulating sand dunes to the Great Barrier Reef, Google has added some of the world’s most spectacular sights to its Street View library over the past year.

Now, it has updated some 3D models in Google Earth, including the Statue of Liberty and bay Bridge in San Francisco.

The attention to details is incredible, with thousands of tiny windows on skyscrapers showing 'reflections' and features demonstrating the texture of monuments.

Stunning: Google has updated some 3D models in Google Earth, including parts of New York (pictured) such as One World Trade Centre, otherwise known as Freedom Tower. The attention to detail is so good that you can see 'reflections' in the skyscraper's glass

New York and San Francisco are the first cities to have got the improved 3D makeover, Susan Cadrecha, of Google, told Mashable. 

Viewers can take a tour of the cities in 3D via Google Earth, or Earth View in Google Maps.

It is possible to spot landmarks from above, before tilting the view to get the whole 3D effect, in order to see all the details.

New and improved: Small details can now be seen more clearly, as shown in this zoomed-in image of the AT&T baseball park in San Francisco on the left. The older version is shown on the right, where the colours aren't as good and adverts less legible

Clever: New York and San Francisco are the first cities to have got a 3D make-over. This shot shows a 3D model of the Statute of Liberty from above. Users can tilt the model to see it from different angles, and easily access Street View photos too in Google Maps Earth View

More coming soon: Users can enjoy landmarks in the cities such as the new Freedom Tower in New York and Coit tower in San Francisco (pictured), and the company says that it will update more 3D models of landmarks around the world throughout next year

Spot the difference: While details of the Empire State Building are visible in the picture on the right, the newer version is clearer and brighter (left). Details on he top of the skyscraper as well as small features on the shorter buildings show this well

Google told TechCrunch that it used improved cameras and better algorithms to reconstruct buildings in the cities in three dimensions. 

Notable improvements include cars that no longer look like they have been flattened and smaller details such as billboards and bus stops looking more realistic than before. However, commentators have remarked that the trees still look a little strange in places.

MailOnline asked Google when existing version of 3D Stonehenge and London are likely to get a makeover, but the search giant says no other cities have been planned yet.

Google last updated the 3D models in its maps in May 2013, with the new versions boasting more details and sharper graphics.

However, the full effect is dependent on a user’s computer, as it can take a long time for such detailed images to load correctly.

Clearer: MailOnline asked Google when Stonehenge and London is likely to get a make-over, but the search giant says no other cities have been planned yet. The shot on the left shows tiny details such as individual bricks and advertisement, which are not visible in the older, less colourful image on the right

Attention to detail: Google said that it used improved cameras and better algorithms to reconstruct buildings in the cities in three dimensions. Notable improvements, include cars that no longer look like they have been flattened and smaller details such as billboards and bus stops, looking more realistic if you zoom in beyond a birds-eye-view ( a shot focused on the Chrysler Building is pictured)

Two months ago, Google strapped its Trekker camera to the back of camel so that Street View users can look across a vast expanse of desert dunes from the comfort of their sofa.

Viewers can see glimmers of green in the distance of the Liwa Desert in the United Arab Emirates, which are often oases, but could also be a mirage.

Using the virtual map though the desert, people can climb sand dunes reaching towering heights of between 16ft and 147ft (5 and 45 metres) and see the views in Google Street View.

The rolling sandy hills were once home to early settlers in the Late Stone Age, making Liwa one of the historic sites in the United Arab Emirates, according to a blog post by Deanna Yick, a Street View Program Manager.

Some of the richest history in this desert lies in the Liwa Oasis - the largest oasis in the Arabian Peninsula.

Many people from across the United Arab Emirates can trace their origins back to the first tribes who settled there and first established the area as a centre for trade. Dates are grown in the oases, and their fruit is important to local cultures.

Google gathered views of oasis plants and vast expanses of sand with beautiful patterns etched by the wind, by attaching one of its Trekkers to a camel, which gathered imagery as it walked.

The tech giant said that the use of camels allowed it to collect authentic images as well as minimally impact the environment.
