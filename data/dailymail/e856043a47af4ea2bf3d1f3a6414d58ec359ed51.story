A member of Nicki Minaj's team was killed, and another man critically injured, after a stabbing in Philadelphia in the early morning hours of Wednesday.

De'Von Pickett, 29, Minaj's tour manager, died after being rushed to a local hospital, while Eric Parker, 27, remains in critical condition.

Minaj shared the news on Twitter, writing; 'Two members of my team were stabbed last night in Philly. One was killed. They had only been there for two days rehearsing for the tour.' 

She also called the incident 'another senseless act of violence that took the life of a great guy.'

According to NBC 10, the argument began inside Che Bar & Grill in Philadelphia’s West Oak Lane neighborhood.

'We believe that both of the victims, as well as the perpetrator, were all inside of this bar and that’s when an argument started,' said Chief inspector Scott Small. 

Small said that they expect Parker to survive.

And while the incident was possibly caught on camera, the man responsible for the stabbings is still at large, having been last seen driving off in a gray Buick LeSabre.

He is believed to be around 30 years old.

According to witnesses, the stabbing had to do with a recently fired employee, though police have yet to verify that story.  

Minaj's tour begins next month in Europe in support of her new album The Pinkprint.

Rihanna also paid tribute to Pickett, who previously worked on her tour, writing; 'Can't believe this is true! one of the nicest, coolest, funniest people I've ever met and toured with! We had so much fun together!!! Sad to lose a beautiful spirit like yours#RIPDayDay.' 

Rapper Fabolous also paid tribute, writing; 'My heart is heavy right now... God opened my eyes this morning at 9:49am. For some reason at that time I woke up thinking about both of these guys. They both work with me, but I couldn't figure out why they were in my mind at 1st wake up. Wasn't sure if I had a dream & they were in it or just some wake up & process things type shit.. But at 10:04 my brother hit me & told me...

'My friend died & my friend Eric Parker is in critical condition in the hospital fighting for his life. I am still in shock & don't want to believe this. And it hurts even more knowing how good these two dudes are. How hard these guys work. And how loyal they are to whoever they are down with & each other. Please send Eric Parker your blessings & a prayer for him to pull thru. 

'And RIP to the fallen soldier Day Day. I can't even believe I'm saying that with your name attached to it. & I HATE this being a post!! I will miss your energy, your vibe, & you but I'll hold on to your spirit!! '

Singer K. Michelle wrote; 'I'm in real shock. Woke up this morning to some awful news that you passed. My heart is broken. You managed my first tour ever the Rebellious Soul Tour. 

'You Were so supportive and excited about the growth of my career. When are we going to stop killing eachother? They don't even know they took away one of the best. You've guided so many careers. The road for many artist won't be the same. My heart hurts. Praying for your family and I know you are in a better place.'

Pusha T also remembered Pickett; 'It's killing me to talk abt you in the past tense. I don't believe I've ever met someone as selfless as you. No one as humble and for the team as you. I hired you as my road manager simply because I knew you were more honest than me. 

'There were stronger, more experienced, more polished candidates for the job but they weren't better than you. You made me see good in people. You gave everyone a chance, they should've gave you a chance. You didn't deserve this. Love you.' 

Police are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.
