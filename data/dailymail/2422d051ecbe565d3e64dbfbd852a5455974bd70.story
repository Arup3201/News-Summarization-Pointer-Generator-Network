Bank of England governor: Mark Carney signalled that better-than-expected growth over the successive quarters had built up momentum

Britain is ‘more than halfway towards the finish line’ as the country's economy continues on the road to full recovery from the global financial crisis, the Bank of England governor has said.

Mark Carney even signalled that better-than-expected growth over the successive quarters had built up momentum going forward, with the economy predicted to grow by 3.5 per cent this year.

He told The Sunday Times: ‘Wherever the finish line was in the depths of the crisis, we are much more than halfway towards that finish line now.

‘The expansion is proceeding, momentum is more assured; the very fact we have had consistent quarters of growth in line with, or slightly better than, our forecasts shows that.’

It comes after the Bank released its inflation report this week, with an upgraded forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth for this year from 3.4 per cent to 3.5 per cent.

It was also upgraded from 2.9 per cent to 3 per cent for next year. But policy-makers halved the UK's pay growth forecast for 2014 from 2.5 per cent to a below-inflation 1.25 per cent.

Official data showed annual pay fell by 0.2 per cent in the three months to June, the first decline recorded since the height of the 2009 financial crisis, and a worse drop than the Bank had forecast.

On the wage drop, 49-year-old Mr Carney, 
who took over as governor last July, added he would not wait for pay to 
catch up with the cot of living before putting interest rates up.

‘We have to have the confidence that prospective real wages are going to be growing sustainably (before we raise interest rates) - we don't have to wait for the fact of that turn to raise them,’ he told The Sunday Times.

An interest rate hike is now seen as more likely in February 2015, when rates will have been held at 0.5 per cent for nearly six years. They were slashed in 2009 in a bid to try to nurse the economy back to health.

Meanwhile, unemployment is expected to fall more quickly than it had previously thought, dropping below 6 per cent this year, while inflation is expected to continue to hover below its 2 per cent target for the next three years.
