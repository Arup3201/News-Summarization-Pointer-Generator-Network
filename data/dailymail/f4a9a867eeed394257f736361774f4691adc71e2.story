The Serious Fraud Office is set to launch a criminal probe within days into manipulation of the ‘Wild West’ foreign currency market to see if London bankers benefited.

Regulators have already looked into claims that traders at banks worldwide conspired to rig benchmark rates used by the £3trillion-a-day Forex market.

A criminal investigation would be a major embarrassment for the City, where around 40 per cent of the world’s foreign exchange is traded.

Sources say Britain’s main fraudbuster is days away from what would be a significant development in the scandal, which is already under investigation by a raft of other organisations.

An SFO spokesman last night said it was ‘receiving and examining complex data’. He added: ‘If and when we open a criminal investigation, that decision will be announced in the usual way.’

An announcement is expected to be linked to extra funding being granted to the SFO from the Treasury.

The
 SFO is already involved with a number of high profile and expensive 
probes including the alleged manipulation of bank interest rates known 
as Libor.

Under investigation: Several high street banks have been dragged into the probe into the unregulated foreign exchange rate market - likened to the 'Wild West'. Barclays (pictured) has confirmed it is being investigated

 foreign exchange rate market – likened by whistleblowers to the ‘Wild 
West’.

Banks buy and sell foreign currency on behalf of clients, but traders can also bet on whether a currency will move up or down in value.

Regulators in the United States, Asia and Europe suspect that traders have manipulated benchmark currency rates so they can rig their own bets.

Grilling: Governor Mark Carney was grilled over the Bank of England's involvement in the scandal by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee earlier this year

The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has already been looking into claims that bank staff are making foreign currency trades before processing customers’ orders.

It has previously emerged that a senior currency trader at emerging markets specialist Standard Chartered, formerly employed at Barclays and then Swiss bank UBS, had been suspended.

Around 30 bankers at 10 banks have been suspended since last Summer.

Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Deutsche Bank have all confirmed they are being investigated.

Even the Bank of England was dragged into the investigation when it suspended one of its own officials earlier this year.

It also hired law firm Travers Smith to look into whether its staff had been involved in or turned a blind eye to manipulation of the Forex markets.

Governor Mark Carney was grilled over the Bank’s involvement in the scandal by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee earlier this year.

He faced questions about Martin Mallett, the Bank’s chief currency dealer, who is known as The Hammer.

Mallett chaired the foreign exchange joint standing committee chief dealers sub group - a forum to discuss issues with the City’s most senior currency traders - since 2005.

It emerged that the issue of possible Forex market manipulation was first raised at a meeting of the group in July 2006.

The Bank has been looking into whether the group failed to properly record or pass on evidence of market manipulation.
