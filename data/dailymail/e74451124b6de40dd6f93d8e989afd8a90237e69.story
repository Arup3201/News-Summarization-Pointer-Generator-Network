A man accused of throwing acid in the faces of two schoolgirls after his sexual advances were rejected has fainted while being handcuffed and paraded before an angry mob.

Pictures taken at a press conference yesterday announcing the arrest of Jiwan BK, 20, show him being dragged by police through a crowd in Kathmandu, Nepal, in a semi-conscious state.

His arrest comes a month after schoolgirls Sangita Magar, 16, and Sima Basnet, 15, were studying at a school in the capital when a masked attacker barged into the classroom and splashed acid across their faces.

BK, 20, is accused of throwing acid in the faces of two schoolgirls after one of them rejected his advances

Police claimed he admitted being 'infatuated' with Sangita Magar and wanted to disfigure her

It is feared the suspected revenge attack has left the teenagers scarred for life after they suffered severe chemical burns to their faces, torsos and legs.

Horrific photographs taken of the two while they recovered in hospital caused an outcry across the country as they described an 'intense burning' and pouring water on their faces to try and stop their skin from melting.

The Baltic Review reported the area's police chief Pushka Karki has now said: 'The attacker will appear in court on Sunday, he did not resist the arrest.

'He claimed that he was infatuated with Sangita, one of the victims, and wanted to disfigure her as an act of revenge after she rejected his romantic advances.'

Chameli Magar, Sangita's mother, added that the 'coward' had ruined her daughter's life and she hoped he would either die in jail or hanged.

However, Nepalese law states that such attacks are only punished by anywhere between three months to three years in prison - depending on the severity of the disfigurement.

BK was a former tenant at the Magar family home and police claimed to have found cuttings of newspaper reports of his attack in his currently-rented room, according to Ekantipur.com.

Acid attacks disfigure and often blind their victims, who are usually women and often the target of some form of revenge bid.

The disputes, which happen in many parts of South Asia, can be linked to dowry, land disputes or refusal to a man's advances.

Although acid attacks are now a criminal offence in neighbouring India, there are no specific laws addressing it in Nepal.
