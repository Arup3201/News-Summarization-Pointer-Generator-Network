A Tory former policing minister was slammed today after using the word 'f*ckwit' on live TV today.

Nick Herbrert used the foul slur while criticising the response to Home Secretary Theresa May's attack on the way ordinary police officers treated the public.

Mrs May had accused PCs of treating the public with 'contempt' and threatened to overhaul the way they ran themselves if they did not sort themselves out.

Her controversial speech to the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth yesterday sparked a furious response from rank and file officers.

But Mr Herbert slammed the police's reaction and accused one senior former policeman of using the foul term to describe Mrs May.

Nick Herbert sparked controversy after swearing on the BBC's Daily Politics TV show. Presenter Jo Coburn was forced to apologise for his behaviour and warn him not to repeat the slur.

After using the word  on the BBC's live Daily Politics programme, hosted by Andrew Neil, Mr Herbert was inundated with complaints and the BBC was forced to apologised for the remark.

The Conservative MP was criticising some police officers’ 'infantile' response to the Home Secretary's speech yesterday..

He said: 'I am afraid there have been a minority who have been outspoken and they are very active on twitter and I saw Peter [Kirkham – former detective chief inspector] himself yesterday described the Home Secretary as a ‘f*ckwit’ in his own twitter line.

'Indeed we should not have any more of it from either police officers or former police officers - this kind of infantile discussion that goes on. What we need is a serious discussion about how policing has got to adapt to today’s age and the things that need to be done to sort out the problems that we have seen.'

He later defended his actions and pointed out that he used the term 'disapprovingly'.

But presenter Jo Coburn interrupted Mr Herbert, telling him 'we won't have any more of that' and cautioning him to speak 'without repeating any of those expletives'.

Mr Herbert responded: 'Indeed we should not have any more of it, from either police officers or former police officers, this kind of infantile discussion that goes on.'

The Home Secretary launched a furious assault on the police yesterday - accusing them of treating the public with 'contempt'

At the end of the programme Ms Coburn offered a full apology for the outburst, saying it was unacceptable and would not be repeated.

Explaining his actions on Twitter following the broadcast, Mr Herbert said: 'Shame on the former police officer on the prog who used the word to describe the Home Sec and who I was quoting disapprovingly.'

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'Daily Politics is a live programme and, as with any live broadcast, occasionally slip-ups may happen. We apologised to viewers immediately for any offence caused.'

A number of people expressed their disapproval on Twitter that such language was used on a daytime political discussion.

Mr Kirkham later appeared to dispute having used the term, posting a message which said: 'Genuinely don't recall doing so 'a couple of days ago'!'

Labour MP Liz Kendall was among those to condemn the bad language, saying on Twitter: 'My dad is constituent of Nick Herbert. Very unhappy at reports of his comments on Daily Politics. Completely inappropriate, especially for an MP.'

Mr Herbert was attacking the Police Federation's response to Mrs May's brutal assault on their record.

He said the organisation, which represents rank and file officers, had been a 'terrible advert' for British policing and welcomed, what he described as, their reluctant acceptance of the changes proposed at conference.

'I think there is this continuing problem that there is an element within the Police Federation that hasn’t understood the importance of policing needing to change and the Federation itself needing to change. 

'The Federation has been a terrible advert for policing; the behaviour of its members during the conferences, which has been often boorish even drunken; the way in which they refuse to embrace any kind of discussion about the police service, has to do with a lot of the problems that it has confronted. 

'There have been string of problems and they have got to be addressed. The Home Secretary listed all of those. It’s not representative, it’s not diverse, there are very few women there, there are certainly almost no black and minority ethnic police officers there. It’s a really bad advert for British policing and it has to change and it’s not just me saying that.

'There has been this report, led by David Normington commissioned by the federation itself that listed all the ways in which the Federation was not fit for purpose and needed to change and pointed out that it does not enjoy the confidence of the overwhelming majority of its own members.

'I am very pleased that finally the Federation did, yesterday, vote for change. It was opposed by the Metropolitan Police Federation, which was a quarter of all policing. So I am afraid there are elements which don’t understand, that live in this Jurassic Park world of policing in a different age and I’m afraid it’s got to change.'
