His eyes flitting from girl to girl, Turkish waiter Murat Can Ertani prowls the streets of Marmaris in search of another impressionable target.

These photographs were taken just a week after the 22-year-old ran away with British schoolgirl Faye Jones, sparking a massive police hunt across Turkey.

A well-known figure on the town's popular club scene, Ertani blew air-kisses to waitresses and exchanged high fives with bouncers as he sidled through the throng of party-seeking holidaymakers, reported the Daily Mirror who sent a reporter to tail him for a night.

Turkish Casanova? His eyes flitting from girl to girl, Turkish waiter Murat Can Ertani prowls the streets of Marmaris in search of another impressionable target

After threatening the paper with violence, he revealed his secret to seduction.

He bragged: 'I don’t ever tell the girls they are pretty or say nice things. I tell them they have a belly and ask if they are pregnant.

'If you are rude and they laugh, you can be with them. If they don’t laugh, there is always another one.'

Ertani, 22, and Faye were found on 
Monday after four days on the run from the Turkish resort of Marmaris, 
where the teenager was holidaying with her mother Rhonda.

Released by the police on on Tuesday morning, he went straight to Club Pacha in Armutalan, described as a 'more family-based area away from the main town and harbour where the younger crowd flock'.

Yesterday it was revealed Ertani, who has been to prison six times, 
said English girls were 'easy' and claimed he would run away with Faye 
or another English girl, as long as they were over 18 - the Turkish age 
of consent.

He claimed he had already moved on from Faye with another British girl who had seen him in the news.

'I
am in love with the girl next to me,' he said. 'When she leaves there 
is always another one. Girls love a bad boy and that is me. Girls get 
boring and I cannot stay with just one for more than a few weeks.'

And today the Daily Mirror claimed to have spotted him and his friends 'scouring the streets nightly' in a bid to find new girls to prey on.

The paper said they tend to focus on the more family-orientated bars where parents have had a drink and are more likely to drop their guard.

It sent a reporter to tail the love rat throughout the night who claims to have spotted him communicate with numerous girls on Facebook in his mobile phone before slinking off to a dark corner to meet a tall British blonde.

Ertani was arrested when he and Faye were found trying to hitchhike in Mugla, 35 miles from Marmaris, but released the next day after Faye refused to press charges against him.

She told Turkish police officers: 'He shouldn't go to jail. He did nothing wrong. It was my fault for running away.'

The convicted burglar, who had been chatting to Faye for a year through Facebook before they met, called their disappearance 'an adventure' in his 'boring' life and ungallantly said the 16-year-old was 'not so pretty really'.

He claimed that she told him she was 19 but found out she was underage by reading a newspaper. He denied they had had sex, saying the situation was too stressful.

Not going back: The pictures emerged as Faye appeared on television with mother Rhonda to reveal she was forced to sell her gold ring to buy food for the couple

The pictures emerged as Faye appeared on television for the first time since the ordeal to reveal she was forced to sell her gold ring to buy food for the couple.

Speaking to ITV's This Morning, she said: 'We didn't have any money, I sold a gold
ring for £10 that got us some food to get by. We stayed at different, 
horrible places. We didn't have much to eat just enough to keep going.'

Describing the moment she decided to run away, she said: ‘When I woke up I didn't have plans to run away. It was just thought up and one in half an hour.

Reunion: Faye also revealed she feels ashamed of her behaviour and must now take responsibility for her 'selfish outburst'

Ertani has served six prison sentences - including one for stabbing a man who looked at him 'funny'

'I sent Can a message on Facebook saying I didn’t want to leave and he said I didn’t have to. Then he was outside my hotel in a car. When I got in the car it was a thrill but also crazy, I didn't really know what I was doing.

She went on to say she hoped she would be found because she was 'too ashamed' to ring her mother.

She added: 'I knew what she must have been going through but it was a selfish outburst I don't really know what took over.

'I went willingly and it was my idea even though he’s older and people will say he should know better it was also my fault and I have to take responsibility for that so I don't think he should go to jail.'
