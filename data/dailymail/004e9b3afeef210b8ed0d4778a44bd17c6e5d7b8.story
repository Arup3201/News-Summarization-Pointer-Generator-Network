It was sad to leave Queens Park Rangers this week but once Harry Redknapp had decided that he couldn’t go on, it felt like the right thing to leave at the same time.

Harry brought me in there to do a specific job and, once he had gone, there seemed no point in staying.

It was a surprise how quickly it all turned out.

Glenn Hoddle decided to leave QPR following Harry Redknapp's resignation from the west London outfit 

Hoddle enjoyed his time at QPR but it was only right to leave the club following Redknapp's departure 

Harry has been in pain for some time with his knees and the news that he needed an operation was a real blow to him. Last time that happened he was on crutches for 12 weeks.

That said, we were in and out of the relegation zone and I reckon if Harry had been able to stay, we would have climbed out of the bottom three once again.

Everyone on the coaching staff was aware that we needed better results. But equally it looked as though fortunes were going to ebb and flow throughout the season among the teams towards the bottom.

Each week another team or manager seems to be under pressure. We were confident we could make sure it wasn’t us by the end of the season.

I’ve heard all the theories as to why he left but I don’t believe it was related to the January transfer window.

The club tried to bring in the right players but, as deadline day approached, it simply became harder and harder.

The 57-year-old coach joined Queens Park Rangers' coaching team in August 2014 

I have enjoyed the past six months, however. I’ve never been in a pure coaching role before and, though I was apprehensive when I went into it, I discovered that I really enjoyed it.

Clearly as manager there has to be a degree of distance between you and the team. You’re always the man who has dropped half of the squad, so it’s impossible to be too close.

But that wasn’t the case as a coach and I found I liked being that much closer to the players.

I also enjoyed coaching the Under 21s at times. There are a good crop of players coming through at QPR from there. My hope for the club is that they do now stay up under a new manager.

There were some good people at the club and I enjoyed my time there.

As for the future, I have some business interests and I enjoy writing this column and of course I have my punditry with Sky Sports and ITV.

Some offers have come in but for now I’ll take stock and work out what is best for me and my family.
