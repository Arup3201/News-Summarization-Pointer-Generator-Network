In the midst of political wrangling over budgets, deficits and debt ceilings, a new talking point has emerged on the right side of the aisle: The U.S., say some Republicans, can continue to service its debt load long past Oct. 17 – the date when Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warns the U.S. will default on its fiscal obligations – even if Congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling.

The New York Times explored the issue Wednesday in an article under the headline: 'Many in G.O.P. Offer Theory: Default Wouldn’t Be That Bad.'

No one has argued in favor of default, but some Republicans have suggested that refusing to raise the debt ceiling would instead force the Treasury to find new ways to avoid it.

Rep. Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican on the House Budget Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that 'the nation will not default on its debts' in the absence of a debt ceiling hike.

Much ado about nothing? Rep. Scott Garrett (R) is among the Republicans who say the U.S. can keep paying its debts even if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling. But Rep. Nita Lowey (L) says he has 'a distorted view of reality'

On Tuesday President Obama slammed Republicans whom he said don't believe a debt default is a 'big deal,' but he didn't parse the differences between default and a debt limit ceiling that might force fiscal discipline on the federal government

'We support the idea of the administration doing what's within its authority to actually pay the debt,' Garrett said.

'You know, the debt payments are around $20 billion, up and down, per month. Income coming in, revenue coming in is around $230, $240 billion a month. We want to make sure the debt is always paid. There's not a single Republican who does not want the debt payments of this country paid.'

Blitzer and Rep. Nita Lowey, the Democratic counterpoint guest opposing Garrett, were unconvinced.

'If they don't raise the debt ceiling,' Blitzer asked, 'you think the U.S. can still go ahead and pay all its responsibilities, including making sure Social Security checks go out on time, and all of the domestic and national security bills that come up?'

'Actually,' Garrett replied, 'the answer to your question: Uh, yeah. If you look at the revenue flow coming in, we've prioritized this before. This has been looked at for years now.'

Lowey scoffed. 'It seems to me that you have a distorted view of reality when it comes to the debt,' she said.

Good news? 'If you don¿t raise your debt ceiling,' said Sen. Rand Paul, 'all you're saying is, "We"re going to be balancing our budget"'

The Times quoted North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who argued that government employee furloughs would free up nearly enough money to service the federal debt during the partial shutdown that began a week ago.

'We always have enough money to pay our debt service,' said Burr. 'You’ve had the federal government out of work for close to two weeks; that’s about $24 billion a month. Every month, you have enough saved in salaries alone that you’re covering three-fifths, four-fifths of the total debt service, about $35 billion a month. That’s manageable for some time.'

House Republicans, however, have pushed for legislation that would give furloughed workers back pay when the shutdown is over. If Senate Democrats were to take up the measure and Obama were to sign it, those savings would vanish in the long term.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the libertarian-hued Republican known for his controversial positions, agreed that declining to raise the debt ceiling might be a sign of fiscal responsibility.

'If you don’t raise your debt ceiling,' Paul told the Times, 'all you’re saying is, "We’re going to be balancing our budget." So if you put it in those terms, all these scary terms of, "Oh my goodness, the world’s going to end" – if we balance the budget, the world’s going to end? Why don’t we spend what comes in?"'

'If you propose it that way, the American public will say that sounds like a pretty reasonable idea.'

No worries: Sen. Richard Burr told The New York Times that 'we always have enough money to pay our debt service'

House Speaker John Boehner duels with Obama in successive press conferences on Tuesday, saying 'there's going to be a negotiation' on the debt ceiling. The White House is now hinting that a very short-term debt limit hike might be acceptable if it leads to broader budget negotiations

President Obama said during a press conference on Tuesday that defaulting on the national debt would be a catastrophic fiscal milestone in American history, but he didn't acknowledge that refusing to increase the debt ceiling might not have an immediate effect.

'When I hear people trying to downplay the consequences of that,' he said, 'I think that’s really irresponsible. ... And it’s particularly funny coming from Republicans who claim to be champions of business. There’s no business person out here who thinks this wouldn’t be a big deal, not one.'

'You go to anywhere from Wall Street to Main Street, and you ask a CEO of a company or ask a small-business person whether it’d be a big deal if the United States government isn’t paying its bills on time. They’ll tell you it’s a big deal. It would hurt.'

The president will meet with members of the House Democratic Caucus on Wednesday in the East Room of the White House to discuss the political stalemate that has gripped Washington for weeks.

The White House says Obama will have similar meetings with House Republicans soon. His bully-pulpit push also included an audience with a group of five conservative pundits and columnists on Tuesday.
