Sunderland have hit out at Jack Colback after the 24-year-old moved to rivals Newcastle United on a free transfer.

The Wearside club are angered that a player they have trained since the age of eight has walked out of the club, and particularly upset that he has joined their neighbours.

Colback chose to sign for his boyhood club Newcastle over Aston Villa and West Ham, who were also interested in his signature.

Pointing the way: Colback says he enjoyed his time at Sunderland but couldn't pass up the opportunity

In a statement the club claimed to have offered the midfielder everything he had asked for, and said that the transfer 'left a bitter taste'.

‘Jack is a player we have nurtured and developed through our academy system since he was eight years old,' the statement read.

'We gave him the opportunity to become a professional footballer and are therefore extremely disappointed in the events that have led to his departure from the club.

‘This wasn’t about money - the club agreed to all of the terms demanded of us during discussions and we were always led to believe that Jack wanted to stay with us.

'At his and his representatives’ request,
 final talks were put on hold until the club secured its top flight 
status. To our dismay however, we were subsequently never given the 
chance to negotiate with him to stay.

‘For him to then leave the club that has supported him throughout his formative years in such a manner, with no chance for Sunderland to recover any of the significant investment that it has made in him as a player, has left a bitter taste.'

The club also posted a picture of Colback celebrating against his new club on their Twitter page.

Colback, however, appears to see the split differently, claiming he leaves Sunderland with positive emotions towards the club.

He said: ‘I’m absolutely delighted. To come to the team I supported as a boy, my hometown team, will be really special for me.

‘It was an 
opportunity I couldn’t let slip. If you asked fans around the world the 
one thing they’d like to do before they die, it would be to play for the
 team they support and I’ve got the chance to do that.

‘I’ve
 only got good things to say about Sunderland, they gave me my chance 
and I want to thank the fans and the club for all their support. I hope 
they can understand the chance I’ve had here to move to my boyhood 
club. 

'Now I can’t wait to pull on the black and white shirt at St. James’ Park for the first time.’

Switching sides: Colback is sure to be booed when he faces Sunderland next season for Newcastle

Colback accepts that he will get stick from Sunderland fans, but says it is all part of being a professional.

'I'm sure I will be hated quite a lot there now and the derby at the Stadium of Light should be interesting,' he told The Sun.

'But it is not something I can dwell on and I am strong enough to deal with it.

'This is football and I couldn't allow myself to think about what fans were going to say and then miss this chance.'
