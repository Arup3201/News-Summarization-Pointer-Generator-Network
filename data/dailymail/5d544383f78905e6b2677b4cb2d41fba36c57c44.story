Wayne Rooney took his young children onto the Wembley pitch as he won his 100th England cap today - before scoring to inspire his side to a 3-1 win.

The Manchester United striker became the youngest ever centurion as he captained the Three Lions in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia.

Rooney was accompanied by his two young signs Kai and Klay as he led England out in front of a near capacity crowd.

His wife Coleen watched on as the 29-year-old was honoured for reaching the landmark making him the ninth England player to reach 100 caps.

His son Kai wore a special 'Daddy 100' shirt to mark the occasion. 

In the game, the England skipper scored with a thunderous spot kick as he moved level with Jimmy Greaves as his country's joint-third highest scorer on 44 goals.

He had started the match against Slovenia with 43 goals for England, fourth on the all-time list behind England greats Bobby Charlton (49), Gary Lineker (48) and Jimmy Greaves (44).

Charlton, who won 106 caps and is now a director at Rooney's club, presented him with a symbolic golden cap in a glass case before kickoff on a proud day for the former Everton star.

Rooney's equaliser came two minutes after Slovenia took the lead when Milivoje Novakovic whipped in a free-kick and Jordan Henderson sent a header flying past Joe Hart for an own goal.

England secured the win with two goals from Danny Welbeck who put ahead after 66 minutes with a scrappy left-foot shot before making it 3-1

Rooney was the youngest player to represent England at the time, aged 17 years and 111 days, when he came on at halftime to win his first cap in a friendly against Australia at Upton Park on Feb. 12, 2003, beating a record that had stood since 1879.

He became the youngest player to score for England seven months later in a 2-1 win over Macedonia in a Euro 2004 qualifier in Skopje on Septemner 6, 2003, aged 17 years 317 days.

Although Theo Walcott eclipsed his youngest appearance record in 2006, Rooney's record as youngest scorer still stands. 

England's appearance record is held by Peter Shilton, the goalkeeper who was capped 125 times. David Beckham made a record 115 outfield appearances.

'I don't just want to be remembered as one of the players who gets 100 caps,' Rooney recalled ahead of his 100th match. 'I want to be successful and we haven't been successful. That's how teams and players get rated.

'I would say it hasn't always been great but it has always been magical playing for England.'

But Rooney, who made his England debut against Australia in 2003, revealed that he came close to quitting the sport aged 14.

'I had stopped enjoying football,' Rooney said, recalling how a coach made him 'fall back in love with football.'

Rooney succeeded Steven Gerrard as England captain in August.

Far more was expected of Rooney after announcing himself on the international scene with four goals at Euro 2004 as an 18-year-old forward.

But the 2006 World Cup campaign was remembered for his red card against Portugal, and he struggled four years later in South Africa.

Although Rooney broke his World Cup goal drought at his third competition in June, England went out in the group stage with only one point - leaving the country without a title since its only success at the 1966 World Cup.
