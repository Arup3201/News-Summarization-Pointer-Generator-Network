The Baltimore Ravens have reached a settlement in the disturbing domestic violence case that led to football star Ray Rice's suspension from the game.

But while the terms of the settlement have not been released, Rice had been seeking more than $3.5 million for wrongful termination.

The three-time Pro Bowl running back was released after video of him knocking out wife Janay — then his fiancee — in an elevator was released publicly by gossip site TMZ in September.

United front: Former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice (pictured arriving at court with his wife, Janay Palmer, on November 5) and The Baltimore Ravens have reached a settlement

Shocking footage: The footballer was suspended from the National Football League indefinitely after he was filmed punching Palmer  with his left fist in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino

Brutal: Elevator surveillance cameras caught the moment that Rice punched his then-fiancee Janay in the face in an Atlantic City casino elevator leaving her sprawled out on the floor

The brutal assault saw Rice dragging Janay out of the elevator sparked national outrage and highlighted the often overlooked issue of domestic violence in the NFL.

However,  months after the assault, Baltimore Ravens President Dick Cass said it is now time 'to turn the page' on the incident.

The NFL is still keen to show it is against domestic abuse saying it will  continue its work within the community on the issue of intimate partner abuse.

Rice became a free agent after former federal judge Barbara S. Jones overturned NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's indefinite suspension and reinstated him. 

But he hasn't yet drawn interest from any teams.

In December, Rice chose a Christmas fundraiser collecting toys for needy children for his first public appearance since the video of him knocking out his wife in an elevator was released. 

On the field: During his appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying the player's (pictured) two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice

The 27-year-old attended the Toys for Tots fundraiser, held at the Jimmy's Famous Seafood restaurant in Dundalk.

During an interview, Rice said it 'feels good to be out and among the Baltimore community and just to give back'.

He added addressed the aggravated assault charges laid against him after punching then-fiancee  Palmer, whom he has since married.

'I made a horrible mistake in my life, but, you know, if you truly believe in second chances, you know, they will forgive me,' Rice told CBS Baltimore. 

'We wish Janay and Ray Rice the best,' Cass said.

Yet since the Rice incident brought the issue of abuse to the fore, there have been a spate of similarly shocking incidents with other NFL players.

Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson, created a storm of controversy after he admitted to hitting his son with a switch. 

And this week, Indianapolis Colts linebacker Joshua McNary denied allegations that he raped a woman at his apartment after the pair met during an evening of heavy drinking in early December.

McNary was taken into police custody on Wednesday night after charges of rape, criminal confinement with bodily injury and battery resulting in bodily injury were filed against him.
