The shocking moment a drunk 25-year-old man was Tasered by police after resisting arrest has been caught on camera.

A Windsor Star reporter filmed Thursday night's dramatic confrontation in which a 6'2" man was surrounded by five police officers outside a Canadian bar.

The unidentified man had allegedly tried to start a fight with another patron before officers approached him at The Dugout bar in Windsor about 9pm.

Uncooperative: Five police officers struggled to arrest a drunk 25-year-old man, who appeared to be about 6'2" and 250 pounds, at the Dugout bar in Windsor, Canada

Run for it: The young man charges up the stairs in a desperate bid to escape police

Get a grip: The officers pull of the unidentified man's jacket as he tries to run away

The video shows police telling the inebriated man to drop to his knees and that he was under arrest.

The man refused to comply and continued to smoke a cigarette.

Officers grabbed at his jacket as he tried to escape up the stairs, pulling it off his back.

'Stop resisting. Stop!', the officers can be heard shouting.

After a brief scuffle, the officers yell 'Taser, Taser' as one cop pulls out the high-voltage device.

Just one shot brings the man to his knees. He can be heard howling in pain before falling on his face. Officers handcuff him.

Under arrest: Police continue to hold down the man even though he can barely move after being Tasered, as the firing officer looks at the Taser

'He has a history of violence and 
he's a rather large individual and he became aggressive and officers had
trouble controlling him so the sergeant deployed a Taser, and it was a 
successful arrest,' Sgt. Alan Adams, who did not identify the 
suspect, told Windsor Star.

'He was transported to headquarters without incident. He’s fine
now and he’s in custody.'

The Dugout bartender Brad Tayles said the man had been acting strangely and was gearing up to fight with a patron who was keeping an eye on him.

'It
was an odd event,' Tayles said.

'A guy came in. Apparently he walked 
right into the door. I knew something was a little different about him. 
Then I see him working on our waitress’s computer.

'The funny thing is, 
he found out how to order himself a Blue, and you have to know what 
you’re doing. But I told him forget it. Time to leave.'
