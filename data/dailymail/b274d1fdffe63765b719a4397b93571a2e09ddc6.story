Two female college students who disappeared 900 miles and 12 months apart may have been abducted by the same man, police feared.

Investigators in Bloomington, Indiana said they had contacted authorities in Lafayette, Louisiana after they noticed similar traits in the young women's disappearances.

Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick, 22, who studies at the University of Louisiana was last seen in the early hours of May 19, when she left a friend's house in Lafayette to cycle home. 

Lauren Spierer, 20, who is a student at Indiana State has been missing since June 3, 2011, after a night out with friends in downtown Bloomington.

Connection? Police departments in two states were working together to see if the disappearance of Mickey Shunick (left) in Louisiana and Lauren Spierer in Indiana were related

Both women are blonde and petite, and security footage from around the time of both women's disappearance showed white pick-up trucks in the area.

Investigators later said that the Indiana truck wasn't linked to the disappearance of Miss Spierer, originally from Greenburgh, New York.

The bicycle of Miss Shunick was discovered under a bridge on Sunday more than a week after she disappeared.

Fishermen found the 22-year-old's bike at Whiskey Bay on the Atchafalaya River, Louisiana. Her family were brought to the scene by police and confirmed it was her black and gold Schwinn.

The bike's condition was not released and authorities began searching the river by boat and with divers.

Her mother Nancy Rowe said she believed a vehicle may have hit her daughter while she was cycling home.

Mrs Rowe told USA Today: 'We really think that somebody had an accident. What they need to do is go to some truck stop, a public place... Drop her and run. Don't hurt her. A mistake is a mistake.'

Two days prior to her bike being found, police revealed surveillance footage of the student riding her bike.

Two videos show the University of Louisiana student on St John Street and St Landry Street in Lafayette. In both videos a white four-door, pick-up truck is seen to pass by after Miss Schunick from 1.47am and 1.48am.

Lauren Spierer, a sophomore who is studying fashion merchandising, was last seen walking home barefoot with a male friend from a sports bar and party on June 3 last year.

Surveillance camera footage from an alley between the two students' apartment buildings showed them walking toward the male student's building about 3am. Spierer's keys were later found in the alley, but the petite blonde has not been seen since.

No arrests have been made in the case. However, police have spoken with several persons of interest - including the male friends she was out with.

Last month, police were given a possible lead in what happened to the young woman.

The Bloomington Police Department in Indiana believed that a man charged in the deaths of a 75-year-old family friend and a 44-year-old hairdresser could also be connected to Spierer’s disappearance.

The remains of a 35-year-old woman were also discovered in William ‘Clyde’ Gibson’s backyard.

While Bloomington police said there was no concrete connection between Miss Spierer and Gibson, 54, they added that they are looking into the matter.

Last month, Miss Spierer's mother has spoken about her fears as the one-year anniversary of her daughter's disappearance approaches. 

When asked if she thought that her daughter was alive, Mrs Spierer said: 'We always hope that there's a possibility... but I just don't know.'

Her husband Robert added: 'We try to be realistic... We know that if she had the chance to reach out to us, she would have done it.'

In the case of Miss Shunick, investigators had found no cell phone or purse of the missing woman after she left her friend Brettly Wilson's house.

And as investigators expanded their search to include a $25,000 reward for information, some people in the area began to wonder whether she had been abducted.
