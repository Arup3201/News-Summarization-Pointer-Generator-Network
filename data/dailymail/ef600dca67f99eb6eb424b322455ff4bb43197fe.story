Mr Clark, a twice married father-of-four, spent weeks in hospital after suffering a serious leg injury in the unprovoked attack.

Last month he bravely returned to work at London-based brokerage firm RP Martin where he works as a euro derivatives trader

He gained the nickname 'The Wolf of Shenfield' in homage to the Hollywood blockbuster The Wolf of Wall Street.

Mr Clark spent nearly a month off work after the incident was welcomed back to work with a prank when fellow traders stormed him wearing balaclavas and waving fake guns.
