Suffering: Girls were sold for £600 a time. This picture is posed by a model

During her primary school years, Katie was considered academically gifted and dreamed of becoming a forensic scientist.

At home, her loving parents read her bedtime stories and would at times remind her to feed her giant African land snail.

But when she turned 12 her life changed forever. Sitting on some steps with a friend in Oxford, Katie was approached by two Pakistani brothers who befriended her with alcohol and cigarettes.

She was flattered by the attention they paid her, completely unaware she was being groomed for sexual exploitation until it was too late.

For almost three years she was violently and sexually abused by a gang and then sold for sex on hundreds of different occasions to a network of child abusers across Britain.

Shockingly, during her ordeal she told police and social services she was being abused, but nothing was done to help her.

As some of her abusers started long jail sentences yesterday, Katie spoke for the first time about her three-year nightmare.

She told the Daily Mail: ‘By all accounts I was a bit of a geek at school,’ she said.

‘Then six months later I become somebody who went missing all the time, coming back days later, filthy and dirty.

'The sudden change is scary to think about, even now.’

Katie still struggles to comprehend how a girl with upstanding parents – her father is a civil engineer – could fall prey to such abuse.

‘At the start they made out like they wanted to be your friend.

Then the intensity crept up. They would put you off everybody. They would say your family was your enemy, your friends were your enemies.

‘By this point I thought my teenage 
friends wouldn’t like me any more. They would say if you go back to 
school no one is going to like you because you’re a slag.’

After several months, the Pakistani men began to ask her for sex, pretending to want a loving relationship with her.

But soon they were threatening violence if Katie refused to do what she was told.

life sentence with a minimum of 17 years at the Old Bailey  

Mohammed Karrar (left), 38, was given life with a
 minimum of 20 years for the 'dreadful offences' he committed against 
the girls. His brother Bassam Karrar (right), 34, was also handed a life
 sentence with a minimum of 15 years

‘It’s something I felt I had to do,’ 
she said. ‘Although I knew what sex was, there’s a difference between 
having sex as an adult and as a child. This was people taking advantage 
of a child.’

As her ordeal intensified, Katie was 
taken to rooms in guest houses and flats in the backstreets of east 
Oxford. ‘I was taken to parties,’ she recalled.

‘By party I mean everybody coming and having sex with me. If I said I didn’t want it, it would just happen anyway.’ 

Kamar Jamil (left), 27, was jailed for life with
 a minimum term of 12 years while Assad Hussain (right) , 32, was 
sentenced to seven years in prison

Zeeshan Ahmed, 28, was jailed for seven years for two counts of sexual activity with a child

On some occasions there were up to ten 
men were in the room, waiting to have sex with her.

Katie said: ‘They just thought they could do what they wanted with me, no matter how disgusting. It got to the point where I just went along with things.

'Mentally I shut down and just did it.’

Aged 14, and by now in a care home, she alerted her carer to the abuse but was ignored.

A month after her 15th birthday, she told police that one of her abusers, Akhtar Dogar, was forcing her to have sex with him and other men.

But instead of following up these allegations, she said officers threatened to arrest her for wasting police time.

‘My behaviour and appearance should have been sending alarm bells,’ she said.

Although Katie is now in a long-term relationship, memories of her past still haunt her.

She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder at the age of 15 and suffers from severe bouts of depression and OCD.
