A Labour candidate has turned down a £100,000 donation from Tony Blair

A Labour candidate for Parliament has rejected a £1,000 donation to her campaign from Tony Blair.

The former Prime Minister had promised more than £100,000 to help the party, with the money going to key battleground seats.

Mr Blair made a donation of £1,000 to the local campaigns in 106 target constituencies, saying they were 'where the election will be won for Labour'.

But Dundee East candidate Lesley Brennan said her constituency would not be accepting the money.

Writing on Twitter she said: 'Received donation from Tony Blair. Instinct was to not accept. Discussed with team. Dundee East is not accepting the £1000.'

When the donation was announced last week a Labour spokesman said the party was 'delighted' that Mr Blair had put his own money behind the effort to get Ed Miliband into Downing Street.

In a letter to the 106 candidates - including Ms Brennan - Mr Blair said: 'As the final countdown to the general election begins, I am writing to wish you every success in your efforts to be elected and also to make a donation to your campaign.

'I know how hard it can be to raise money to fund a local campaign, but for you, in one of our 106 battleground seats, it is even more vital.

This is where the election will be won for Labour and that is why I am making a donation to all 106 campaigns.

'As one of our key seat candidates you know better than most the scale of the challenge we face, but I have every confidence that with your drive, determination and organisational skills, you will deliver a successful local campaign that will also see our party returned to government.

'So, good luck and here's to a Labour victory on May 7.'

Mr Blair is in a position to donate £100,000 after making a fortune since leaving Downing Street in 2007.

Leaked documents published today revealed how he proposed a £30million contract to advise the United Arab Emirates while working as the Middle East peace envoy.

Leaked documents published today revealed how Tony Blair proposed a £30million contract to advise the United Arab Emirates while working as the Middle East peace envoy.

The 25-page document provides an insight into how much money he charges international regimes for his services.

It promises the 'intense involvement of Tony Blair' with a commitment to spend 'two to three days a month' in the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi.

Mr Blair has represented the Middle East Quartet since 2007, achieving little diplomatic success while building up a fortune as a business consultant.

But a spokesman for Mr Blair denied that there was a conflict of interest.

He told the Sunday Times there were discussions about working with the UAE, but there was no contract with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. None was planned, and the document 'was not cleared' by Blair.
