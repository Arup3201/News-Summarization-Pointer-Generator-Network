At first, producer Daisy Ayliffe thought she had an intruder on her hands.

Giant cuddly teddy bears kept appearing one-by-one outside her bedroom door, ready to greet her as she rose for work.

Then one morning the mystery was solved as a real-life cat burglar, Zaza, peered in through the cat flap surreptitiously carrying a soft giant doughnut.

The tortie oriental pedigree treated her owners to 17 toys in a single month

The five-year-old feline dragged its find through the flap and thoughtfully deposited it in on the kitchen floor.

Nearly a month later, Miss Ayliffe, who lives with her partner Ben Wicks, both 33, in central London, had been treated to a total of 17 cuddly toys – ranging from a Roman gladiator to a Winnie the Pooh bear.

While the couple could not be sure, it appeared Zaza, a tortie oriental pedigree, was stealing the toys from its neighbours’ homes.

Zaza was caught in the act of cat burgling while bringing this soft doughnut in through the cat flap

While Daisy and Ben theorise that the cat is getting the toys from neighbour's gardens, they don't know for certain where they're coming from

Miss Ayliffe said: ‘I think they must have been from someone’s garden, although she could have been going into other people’s houses.

‘My sister said the neighbours would be really cross but it’s not my fault the cat is a thief.’

Zaza is a rescue pet that was given to the couple along with its sister Betty nearly a year ago.

The cat, which has had the official name Nutrostar Aprilmoon, is quite a find because it is classed as Champion, having won three awards for its beauty and temperament.

But when it was brought into the family home it started turning its paws to other talents.

Miss Ayliffe said the first teddy the cat brought in was earlier this year and was a small Mr Strong teddy. She said: ‘It was small and I thought she obviously found that in a garden.

While Daisy hopes the toys are coming from gardens, she cannot rule out that Zaza is going into other houses

‘Then she brought in a second one the next day which was a Winnie the Pooh teddy.’

She said the cat has a weakness for teddy bears, adding: ‘She basically stole teddy bears and only teddy bears.

‘It obviously has some sort of fetish, the nylon, synthetic material must somehow appeal to her.

‘She used to leave them outside the bedroom door for us, it was really funny. I came home one day and there were three massive teddy bears in the house.’

But having not seen the cat in action – and with many of toys being larger than Zaza itself, Miss Ayliffe was not entirely convinced it was the cat bringing them in.

She said: ‘I was on the phone to my friend who was saying maybe you have an intruder that is bringing the teddies in – the cat wouldn’t be bringing in massive teddy bears.

‘Then at the moment the cat came through the cat flap with a giant doughnut.

Size doesn't seem to matter for Zaza who is happy to drag a full sized teddy bear back to her owners

Daisy and Zaza have now moved to a flat with a walled garden, putting an end to her criminal ways

‘I thought, this is really weird. Then another day I thought she had caught a mouse as something was squeaking but then I realised it was a squeaking teddy bear and it has just gone on from there.

‘I woke up one day with an Eeyore bear in my bed. I’ve also had a hanging mobile from a baby’s pram.

‘She has brought loads of them that are bigger than her and she’s climbing along fences with these teddy bears. She must have really strong jaws.’

The 17th gift appeared as the couple were having dinner in the garden one weekend. A giant teddy bear dropped on them from the fence above their heads.

Miss Ayliffe added: ‘A big brown bear fell on our table and she came to see us, we actually saw her in action. It’s sweet the way she offered them as gifts, she’s a bonkers cat.’

The couple have now moved to a flat where there is a walled garden so the cat cannot get out and steal.Miss Ayliffe said: ‘We have been able to stop her burgling.

‘Although in the first week in our new flat the little boy in the flat above lost his teddy bear as it had fallen from his window. Zaza found it within seconds. She came rushing in to our new flat with it in her mouth.’
