This heart-stopping video shows the moment a baseball fan is saved from a flying  bat by the peak of his cap.

The unnamed St. Louis Cardinals fan seems completely unaware that a baseball bat flung by his own player is heading straight for his face, despite dozens of spectators sat around him raising their hands to protect themselves.

The bat, accidentally thrown mid-swing by Cardinals player A. J. Pierzynski, flies towards the fan and strikes him on the head - but other than appearing embarrassed he seems to be fine.

The unnamed fan is struck by A. J. Pierzynski's bat - but luckily it only hits him on the peak of his cap

Pittsburgh Pirates' Mark Melancon pitched to St. Louis Cardinals player Pierzysnki, who swung hard at the ball

Pictures from the match show Pierzynski has a tight hold on his bat as he prepares for the pitch

But as he swings and slices his shot, the bat comes flying out of the player's hands in the direction of the stand

The hilarious pictures show Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Mark Melancon tossing the ball at Pierzynski in the ninth innings of yesterday's National League match.

The batsman swings and slices his shot, with the ball flying off behind him.

But just as the ball disappears from shot, Pierzynski loses control of his bat, flinging it towards the crowd.

As the bat soars towards the stand, the spectator's raise their hands over their head - some in an attempt to catch the bat, others trying to protect themselves from serious injury.

At the same time Cardinals players sat on the team bench below the stand dive to the ground, fearing the projectile could be headed for them. 

Meanwhile one Cardinals fan, wearing a red shirt and black cap, is clearly not aware of the imminent danger and continues to stare out into the field.

Cardinals fans begin to realise the imminent danger as the bat is flung towards them at high speeds

Spectators raise their hands over the heads and cower in fear, but one man seems completely oblivious

The bat crashes into the man's head, but luckily the handle only makes impact with the peak of his cap 

I'm OK! The man, awoken from his daydream, holds up the bat as the woman next to him clutches her wrist

They both seem fine after the impact, and the bat can be seen resting next to the two Cardinals fans

With the bat just feet away from striking him, a blonde woman sat to his left tries to block it, but fails.

The handle of the baseball bat connects with the man's cap, suddenly waking him from his daydream.

Luckily he seems unhurt, and laughs as he clutches the bat.

Meanwhile the woman sat next to him is holding her arm, suggesting the bat hit her too.

Pierzynski, who does not look like he is enjoying the incident as much as the fans, then walks over to get his bat back for the next pitch. 

The Cardinals went on to lose 3-1. 

 

Pierzynski, who seemed less amused by the incident, then has to make a walk of shame over to the crowd

He collects the bat from a steward and trudges back to the field for the next pitch, thoroughly embarrassed
