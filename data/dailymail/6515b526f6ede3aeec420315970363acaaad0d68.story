A defence lawyer for accused child murderer Levi Aron has sensationally quit the case after more horrific details were revealed about the killing.

Gerard Marrone, 37, said his conscience prevented him from continuing defending Aron, 35, over the alleged murder of eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky.

The New York lawyer and father-of-three admitted he cried about the case earlier this week and one of his children is just a year younger than the victim.

Lawyer quits: Gerard Marrone, 37, left, said his conscience prevented him from continuing defending Levin Aron, 35, right, over the alleged murder of eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky in New York

‘I have three little boys,’ Mr Marone told the New York Daily News.

‘You can't look at your kids and then
look at yourself in the mirror, knowing that a little boy, who's close 
in age to my eldest son, was murdered so brutally.’

Earlier this week it was revealed police found the boy's severed feet in the man's freezer, and the rest of his body in bins near the house, as well as a chopping board and three bloody carving knives.

He told ABC: ‘A little piece of me died when I got the case.’

It’s also believed Aron could face the federal death penalty if convicted after he took Leiby across state lines to New Jersey.

Defence lawyer Scott Greenfield has criticised Mr Marrone’s decision.

Grief: Leiby's mother Esther joined family members for a walk to 'escort his soul to its final resting place'

Outpouring: At least 8,000 people gathered in Brooklyn as Leiby's casket was carried to his funeral service

‘He knew the allegations going in,’ Mr Greenfield wrote in a blog. ‘He knew what he was getting involved with.

‘He's chosen to quit, to walk away 
from his client and in the process, to announce that he, as defence 
lawyer, is too sickened by his client's actions to remain beside him. 
This he cannot do.’

But Mr Marrone has received support from others. Rachel Bana wrote on his Facebook page: 'So proud of ur decision.'

Suzanne Seitz posted: 'Thank you dear man. May you have endless blessing on you and your dear family.'

Amateur boxer Mr Marrone was shot in 
the back aged 21 and has walked with a limp ever since - although he was
told he would never walk again.

Charged: Police walk Levi Aron, centre, to a police car in Brooklyn. He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, but has allegedly admitted to police that he abducted Leiby and took him to a wedding

Accused: Levi Aron listens as his other defence lawyer Pierre Bazile speaks at his arraignment in Brooklyn

He says on his website that he fights for the ‘underdog’ and is ‘sincere, honest and cares about his clients’.

Aron was indicted this week over the 
abduction and death of Lieby in Brooklyn, New York, and is now left with
one lawyer - Pierre Bazile.

The Hasidic child got lost and asked a
stranger identified by police as Aron for directions before getting 
into his car earlier this month.

Police later found the boy’s body 
parts and it has since been revealed he was allegedly drugged with pills before 
being smothered and dismembered.

Investigation: Police have been removing items from Levi Aron's home as they look into Leiby's death

Final journey: The street in Brooklyn, New York, where Levi Aron lived, and where parts of little Leiby's dismembered body were found

Concerns have been raised he could be
mentally incompetent to stand trial and his lawyers have suggested he 
might plead insanity.

Leiby’s family want to raise 
$1million for needy children and his parents, Nachman and Itta Kletzky, 
have thanked New Yorkers for their support.

‘We pray that none of you should ever have to live through what we did,’ Mr and Mrs Kletzy said.
