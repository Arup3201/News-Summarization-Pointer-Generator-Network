A hungry shopper had the shock of his life when he went to buy a pizza - and found rats were already eating it.

Disgusted Evgeny Ivanov, 26, had gone to the fast-food outlet at a bus station in Nizhny Novogorad, central Russia, when he spotted the three huge rodents scurrying over the top of the pizzas and tucking in.

Whipping out his mobile phone to film it, appalled Ivanov said: 'I couldn't believe it.

In plain view: Evgeny Ivanov, 26, had gone to the fast-food outlet at a bus station in Nizhny Novogorad, central Russia, when he spotted the three huge rodents scurrying over the top of the pizzas and tucking in

Disgusted: He said the worker at the restaurant was standing by 'completely uncaring' but scurried off herself when he pulled out his phone to film the rodents

'The three rats were enormous and were blatantly gnawing away at the pizzas as the seller stood nearby completely uncaring.

'When I got the phone out she quickly disappeared so I could not film her as well, but I wanted to prove what was happening as there is a real problem with rats around here and seeing this is just unbelievable.'

A spokesman for the food outlet said: 'We are aware of the situation and are taking measures to remove the rats.

'Why the sales assistant didn't alert us to the problem we have no idea but will be questioning her.' 

Shocking: The rats were feasting not only on pizzas but pasties in the display counter as well. A spokesman for the food outlet said the company is 'aware of the situation and is taking measures to remove the rats'

Danger: The region has seen a recent outbreak of Viral hemorrhagic fever, which is commonly spread by rodents and can cause internal bleeding and can be life threatening

Warning: The police have warned other such restaurants to ensure 'nothing similar is happening or is allowed to happen'

The region has seen an outbreak of Viral hemorrhagic fever this year.

Viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) is a severe syndrome that attacks multiple organs within the body.

It is commonly spread by rodents and can cause internal bleeding and can be life threatening.

A police spokesman said: 'We have ordered the pizza outlet to be closed and the food items to be destroyed.

'This is a grave danger to the public and we will be checking other outlets to ensure nothing similar is happening or is allowed to happen.'
