A 13-year-old schoolgirl who set her sights on becoming a model after she suffered cruel taunts about her height after growing to six feet tall has become a beauty pageant queen.

Harriotte Lane was teased and called names on a regular basis because she was always much taller than her fellow pupils at primary school in West Allotment, Newcastle.

But now the teenager has proven to bullies that she is proud of her height after she was recently crowned Junior Miss Tyne and Wear Galaxy.

She said: 'I used to get comments from people saying I was too tall to play with them and that I didn't fit in.

'It was really upsetting for me and it always made me feel really embarrassed. But now I use it as motivation - I see being tall as unique and it's something I'm proud of.

'As I got older I felt that being tall wasn't something I should be ashamed of any more and people started to see me for who I really am.

'I come from a very tall family but despite that I've recently overtaken my dad who is just under six foot tall.

'From modelling and doing pageants I gained heaps of confidence and now I embrace being tall - it's something that quite literally makes me stand out from the crowd.'

Harriotte was always taller than the average height for girls her age when she was growing up - at five she was was three inches taller and by the time she was 10 she was almost six inches taller.

Based on her current growth rate, doctors believe Harriotte - who lives with mother, Sarah, 42, father, Bill, 49, and brother, William, 11 - will grow to be 6ft 3in tall.

But her height has left her suffering with low blood pressure that often leads to blackouts. 

She said: 'The growing pains meant I started feeling sick and dizzy all the time. After months of seeing doctors, my health got worse and they realised my blood pressure was too low.

'I can't actually have any medication or treatment for it because I don't suffer with any type of condition.

The teenager took part in her first competition in August last year in the Miss Junior Teen GB event and was named as second runner-up at the Junior Miss Galaxy UK event (pictured left and right) this month

'I've just been told to make sure I'm always well hydrated and that I live a very healthy and active lifestyle.

'I think the best thing to do that has been joining the pageants - they've helped me raise so much money for charity as well as boosting my confidence.' 

She took part in her first competition in August last year in the Miss Junior Teen GB event and was named as second runner-up at the Junior Miss Galaxy UK event on February 7.

Harriotte is now set to battle it out for the Miss Junior Teen GB title in Blackpool on October 25.

Her proud mother, Sarah, who works as marketing consultant, said: 'The bullying and name-calling was horrific at times - she was always left to feel excluded.

Harriotte, pictured with her friends, says she was taunted and called names while she was at primary school but since she took up modelling part-time her confidence has grown

'On top of all that she had the physical problems that came with growing so quickly - she would stand up and then collapse - often hitting the floor hard or losing her vision.

'But she copes with it all so well now and she's very determined to make the most of the pageants.

'Harriotte has always worked incredibly hard and now she's reaping the rewards of being so brave and strong through those awful times when she was younger.

'She won three awards at the Junior Miss Galaxy UK event, including the Miss Publicity title which she was given for raising awareness of charity work. I couldn't be more proud of her.'

Harriotte set up the Leave Them Alone Facebook campaign in a bid to help others beat the bullies. For more information on the group, visit: facebook.com/Leavethemalonecampaign.
