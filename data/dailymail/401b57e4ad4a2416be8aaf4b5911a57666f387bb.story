'I’m not sitting where she sat,” he alleges she would say.

'She’s stolen my son away.'

Michael Jackson and Elizabeth Taylor formed an unlikely friendship when she attended one of his concerts.

According to ABC, Taylor walked out halfway through, and later he called her almost in tears. She assured him that she left because of bad visibility and not because she disliked his performance.

The phone call turned into a three-hour conversation which in turn became a friendship that spanned more than three decades.

Taylor married her seventh husband Larry Fortensky at Jackson's Neverland ranch in 1991.

And in 1997, Jackson presented Taylor with a song called Elizabeth, I Love You, which he performed at her 65th birthday party.

When his two eldest children Prince Michael and Paris were born, Jackson made Taylor and not his mother their godmother.

When Jackson died in 2009, Taylor was wracked with grief.

'My heart...my mind...are broken,' she wrote on Twitter the day after he died.

'I loved Michael with all my soul and I can't imagine life without him. I don't think anyone knew how much we loved each other. The purest most giving love I've ever known. Oh god! I'm going to miss him.'

Taylor was not present at Jackson's media-thronged funeral. she claimed that she didn't believe Michael would want her to share her grief with millions of others, but a report in the National Enquirer says it's because the Jackson family refused to invite her.

According to the Enquirer's source, at the time 'Elizabeth Taylor was crushed. She’s still crying.'
