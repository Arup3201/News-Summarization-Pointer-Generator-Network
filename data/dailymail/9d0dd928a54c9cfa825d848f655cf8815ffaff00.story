UNEMPLOYMENT in the crisis-torn single currency bloc has reached a record high of nearly 19.5million, figures showed yesterday.

Statistics agency Eurostat said the number out of work in the eurozone rose by 996,000 in the 12 months to the end of September.

The jobless rate hit an all-time high of 12.5 per cent in Italy while more than half of Greeks and Spaniards under the age of 25 who want work cannot find a job.

Though the unemployment rate remained steady at 12.2 percent, the previous month was revised up from 12 percent.

A sharp and unexpected drop in inflation also cast doubts over the recovery of the eurozone, which just emerged from recession, and put pressure on the European Central Bank to act.

Doubts: A sharp and unexpected drop in inflation also cast doubts over the recovery of the eurozone

The euro dropped from above $1.3700 to about $1.3640 in midday trading.

The ECB has already cut its key interest rate to a record low to spur lending. But banks, companies and households are still too afraid to lend or borrow money.

The ECB may be pushed into action eventually if the inflation rate keeps dropping. Eurostat said the annual inflation rate fell to 0.7 percent in October from 1.1 percent a month earlier, marking its lowest level in about four years.

The ECB is tasked with keeping inflation close to, but below 2 percent.

'Latest developments reinforce our view that the ECB will end up cutting interest rates from 0.5 percent to 0.25 percent sooner or later,' said IHS Global Insight's analyst Howard Archer, adding the ECB might take such action as early as in December.

While other analysts think a rate decrease is unlikely in coming months - not least because of resistance from powerful ECB players such as Germany's central bank - the ECB still has other means at its disposal.

It can, among other things, provide more cheap loans to banks to improve their finances and encourage them to lend.

It already issued such loans three times, helping stabilize the financial system, and ECB President Mario Draghi hinted several times in recent months that the central bank might consider issuing another round.

A particularly gloomy stat was youth unemployment - it rose to 24.1 percent from 24 percent in August.

It was lowest in Germany and Austria, with 7.7 percent and 8.7 percent, and highest in Europe's southern economies, which have been hit hard by the debt crisis and government austerity measures.

They were around 57 percent in Greece and 56 percent in Spain.

The overall unemployment rate showed similar disparities. Germany and Austria had low rates of 5 percent.

By contrast, joblessness was 26.6 percent in Spain. In Greece, where the latest figures available were for July - it stood at 27.6 percent.

The unemployment rate for the wider 28-nation European Union remained unchanged in September at 11 percent.Â

The
 general consensus among participants is that emerging market status is a
 more appropriate classification due to the reasons including failing a

Meanwhile Angela Merkel's conservatives today rejected U.S. criticism of Germany's dependence on exports but her likely future coalition partner agreed Europe's bulwark economy must do more to spur domestic demand.

Hit back: Angela Merkel's conservatives today rejected U.S. criticism of Germany's dependence on exports but her likely future coalition partner agreed Europe's bulwark economy must do more to spur domestic demand

The United States has long called for countries like China and Germany with trade surpluses to do more to spur imports but the Obama administration's reprimand in a semi-annual report to Congress on Wednesday stood out for its stark language.

Both Merkel's conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats, who are in talks to form a coalition government after a September election, retorted that Germany would continue to strive to be competitive globally.

'We have always been a strong export country and we are proud of that,' said Ilse Aigner, the conservatives' lead negotiator in coalition talks for economic issues.

The U.S. criticism comes at a tricky juncture in relations between Washington and Berlin. German envoys met the White House national security adviser in Washington on Wednesday after reports the United States monitored Merkel's cellphone.

Germany argues that it has more than halved its trade surplus within the euro zone as a share of GDP since 2007.

Trade is expected to subtract rather than contribute to economic growth this year, with imports outpacing exports, while domestic demand, albeit still weak, will drive growth.
