Sony, GoPro and HTC were among the winners at this year’s T3 awards after picking a host of titles.

Sony was awarded the Gadget of the Year and the Gaming accolade for its PlayStation 4, and the Japanese firm also received the inaugural entry into the T3 Hall of Fame. 

Despite winning awards for its MacBook Pro and Mac Pro, in the Laptop or Tablet of the Year and Design Innovation categories respectively, Apple received boos, and was mocked by host Richard Bacon, for not sending anyone to collect its accolades.
