Suffering: Former Arts Council of Wales chief Frances Medley, 44, wrote an internet diary chronicling her last days before killing herself with drugs she bought online

A leading academic wrote an internet diary chronicling her last days before killing herself with drugs she bought online.

Former Arts Council of Wales chief Frances Medley, 44, was heartbroken at having 
to give up her career after she was struck down by Multiple Sclerosis.

In a poignant blog post, Miss Medley referred to her eight-year illness as 'Cruella', after the villain in the film 101 Dalmatians, and gave a parting message to her readers, urging them to 'Live life as though it could be snatched away from you in a heartbeat'.

Miss Medley also wrote: 'I am very clear that, whilst the law might say otherwise, I AM NOT COMMITTING SUICIDE.'

An inquest into her death heard she left instructions with her closest friends to update her blog explaining why she had 'decided to call it a day'.

Miss Medley was found dead at her home after battling Multiple Sclerosis for eight years.

Her posthumous blog, in which she referred to herself as 'the Spinster' said: 'The prospect of further rapid deterioration was both terrifying and not one I wanted to entertain.

'I decided to end my life in a manner and at a time of my choosing.'

Miss Medley, who was the acting chief executive of the Arts Council in Wales, had kept a blog about her fight against MS.

The inquest was told that she had killed herself in her home by taking a banned drug, which she said in a note that she had bought online.

Her body was discovered in her home in Barry, South Wales, after neighbours became worried they had not seen her for two days.

A post mortem examination showed that her cause of death had been an overdose of the substance.

Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard worried neighbours found a note in the front door window saying: 'Do not enter. Please call the police and call my brother Mark.'

Officers forced entry and discovered Ms Medley’s body in bed and her 'extremely tidy' house prepared with labels saying what items she wanted people to have.

In her final blog post, Miss Medley explained her reasons for ending her life.

She said: 'The loss of my independence both financially and physically has been extremely difficult for me.

Poignant: In her blog post, Miss Medley referred to her illness as 'Cruella', and gave a parting message to her readers, urging them to 'Live life as though it could be snatched away from you in a heartbeat'

'Without the financial support of my immediate family, I would have had to seek the support of the State.

'Whilst of course I was entitled to resort to this I found the prospect humiliating. Pride is a terrible thing, a real burden at times of need.'

In the blog she said the illness had exhausted her emotionally and physically, although in her final post she said she felt she had peaked early in life.

'I don’t leave with rafts of regrets or things I wish I’d done,' she said.

'Happy with my lot is perhaps an exaggeration but had I persisted, my ability to do things would have been daily reduced; my potential it seems has been fulfilled.'

Miss Medley even gave advice in her parting message, writing: 'Live life as though it could be snatched away from you in a heartbeat; take managed risks avoiding recklessness; and treat your fellow travellers with tenderness and care.

'Hold your tongue at times when you risk blurting out judgemental potentially hurtful comments; we seldom know the full back story.'

Painful: Miss Medley was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2005 and her GP Dr James Martin told the inquest she had suffered a great deal of pain 'which simply got too much for her bear'

One of the leading lights of the Welsh arts scene, Miss Medley later became a freelance business consultant for the creative sector and was involved in the National Youth Arts Wales Steering Group and the Magdalena Project, which supports women in theatre and the arts.

She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2005 and her GP Dr James Martin told the inquest she had suffered a great deal of pain 'which simply got too much for her bear'.

Coroner Christopher Wooley told the inquest: 'Frances Medley was obviously a very determined lady who did well in her career.

'For eight years she suffered with Multiple Sclerosis which had been worsening.

'Her GP said it was difficult to control Frances’s pain and various therapies were attempted and none were really very effective.

'She was a very strong character and highly intelligent. Her life was beginning to contract and she found the burden hard the bear.'

He recorded a verdict that Miss Medley ended her own life, adding: 'She planned it meticulously and left letters to say she wanted to end her life - to end the pain at a time and place of her choosing.'

Speaking after the inquest, friend and colleague Gilly Adams said: 'Fran was a remarkable woman who demonstrated great courage and determination.

'She was a very much loved and respected member of the arts community in Wales.'

Her brother Mark added: 'She will be sorely missed by everybody.'

Well dear readers the Spinster has decided to call it a day; Cruella has simply exhausted me emotionally and physically.

The prospect of further rapid deterioration was both terrifying and not one I wanted to entertain.

The
 Spinster decided to end her life in a manner and at a time of my 
choosing; I am very clear that, whilst the law might say otherwise, I AM
 NOT COMMITTING SUICIDE.

It
 has been just over eight years since the Spinster was given the 
unwelcome gift of a chronic incurable degenerative disease; one that 
would destroy my life slowly at first and then in leaps and bounds.

In
 just over 10 years this Spinster went from being a higher rate tax 
payer responsible for running a public body - (as an aside I believe I 
was the youngest woman to do this at the age of 30) - to a position last
 year where I didn’t earn enough to pay tax.

The loss of my independence both financially and physically has been extremely difficult for me.

Without
 the financial support of my immediate family I would have had to seek 
the support of the State. Whilst of course I was entitled to resort to 
this I found the prospect humiliating.

Pride is a terrible thing, a real burden at times of need.

The Spinster fortunately peaked early on life and so I don’t leave with rafts of regrets or things I wish I’d done.

Happy
 with my lot is perhaps an exaggeration but had the Spinster persisted 
my ability to do things would have been daily reduced; my potential it 
seems has been fulfilled.

The
 values by which the Spinster has conducted her life are clarity, 
integrity and wisdom with curiosity and creativity added in for 
Victorious Endeavours.

These
 principles have served the Spinster well as I am leaving this mortal 
coil with a clear conscience albeit with a limited bank balance! 
Integrity is not a road paved with gold!!

So
 live life as though it could be snatched away from you in a heartbeat, 
take managed risks avoiding recklessness and treat your fellow 
travellers with tenderness and care.

Hold
 your tongue at times when you risk blurting out judgemental potentially
 hurtful comments; we seldom know the full back story.

Good bye and good luck ladies (and fellow male travellers too).

The Spinster signs off with sophistication.
