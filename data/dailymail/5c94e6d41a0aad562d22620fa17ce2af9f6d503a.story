What happens after police detectives, crime scene investigators and news trucks leave the scene of a murder?

That is the question that Angela Strassheim has set out to answer with her new photo series titled Evidence, which depicts domestic homicide crime scenes in a new light.

Her chilling and thought-provoking images show interior shots of living rooms, bathrooms and kitchens, which had been the settings of deadly confrontations between family members involving guns, knives, and even a pitchfork.

Dark and captivating: Angela Strassheim's new photo series titled Evidence depicts domestic homicide crime scenes in a new light

Eerie glow: The award-winning photographer created the images by applying a phosphorescent blood splatter solution to the rooms to highlight the traces of violent crime

Scientific trick: Strassheim was able to achieve this effect by applying 'BlueStar' chemical solution, which temporarily activates the heme molecule of blood, making it glow

Secret history: The black and white photos create a compelling narrative out of flecks of blood unseen by the naked eye

Previous career: Angela Strassheim had started out working as a forensic crime lab technician

Macabre fascination: Strassheim wrote about developing an interest in crime scenes and domestic homicides at a young age

Striking: In this image, a bedroom wall is seen covered in droplets of glowing white gore, which resemble rain drops on a windowpane

Strassheim has visited more than 140 crime scenes and talked her way into a variety of homes and motel rooms

Lingering marks: Some of the crimes have taken place recently, while others occurred years earlier. Even though the blood had been wiped clean, its traces remain

Borrowing 
techniques from her days as a forensic crime lab technician, the 
award-winning photographer created the images for the series by applying
 a phosphorescent blood splatter solution to the rooms to highlight the 
traces of violent domestic crime.

‘All
 around me I observe a glowing trail of bloodshed as swaths and 
constellations of light, helping me put together the pieces of a violent
 puzzle,’ Strassheim writes in her artist statement.

About
 half of the pictures in the portfolio depict the exteriors of the crime
 scenes: a handsome two-story mansion with perfectly trimmed hedges; a 
neat suburban home with a white picket fence; a cheap motel room and a 
grey cinderblock apartment complex, among others.

Behind those plain-looking, unassuming façades Strassheim has been able to uncover grisly marks of violence hidden from the naked eye. 

The
 black and white photos create a compelling narrative out of flecks of 
blood lingering on walls, floors, carpets and dressers shrouded in 
darkness.

In one striking image, a bedroom wall with a mattress and 
pillows still in place is seen covered in droplets of blazing white 
gore, which resemble rain drops on a windowpane.

Miss
 Strassheim was able to achieve this startling effect by applying 
‘BlueStar’ solution to the interiors; the chemical temporarily activates
 the heme molecule of blood, making it glow long after the blood itself 
has been cleaned, Wired reported.   

Exterior shots: About half of the pictures in the portfolio depict the exteriors of the crime scenes

Unaware: Some of the current inhabitants of houses where homicides had occurred had no idea about their dwellings' dark history

Grim: At this location along a lonely rural road, a person has been murdered with a knife and a small rod

Facade: The artist chose to title the images with the name of the murder weapon used - in this case, a pair of shotguns

Horrific details: the domestic drama that played out inside this humble residence involved scissors, a clock radio cord and a large fan

A person has been killed with a folding knife inside the grey housing complex on the left ; A gun was used as a murder weapon inside this cheap motel on the right

Savage crime: This high-end sprawling home has become the site of a domestic homicide where a pitchfork was used as a murder weapon

No one is immune: The goal of the project is for people viewing Strassheim's photos to entertain the possibility that they too can be a victim, or murder a loved one out of jealousy or rage

The artist chose to title the images of the exteriors with the name of the murders weapon used - shotgun, kitchen knife, scissors – while leaving the rest of the information about each homicide to the viewer’s imagination.

‘As a child, when I would pass by a house where a violent and newsworthy death had recently occurred, I would stand there, close my eyes and try to imagine what took place,’ writes Strassheim.

As part of the project, Strassheim has visited more than 140 crime scenes and talked her way into a variety of homes and motel rooms whose current residents often had no idea about their dwellings’ grisly past.

As Strassheim explains in her statement, her ultimate goal is for people viewing her photos to entertain the possibility that they too can be a victim of violence, or murder a loved one out of jealousy or rage.
