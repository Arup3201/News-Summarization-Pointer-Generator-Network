A mother accused of throttling her 10-year-old son to death because she thought his big ears were ruining his life  is facing murder charges in Turkey.

Nuray Sacan, 37, paid for her son to have cosmetic surgery in Gazi Hospital in the capital Ankara, but later told surgeons she was unhappy with the results.

Later that evening Ms Sacan took the boy to the women's toilets at the hospital, where she allegedly choked him to death with a scarf. In a rush to escape she crashed her car and was taken back to the hospital for treatment, where she is understood to have confessed to killing her son.

During her confession, Ms Sacan said: 'Both his ears had become even bigger after the surgery.'

'He became very ugly. He would have felt even more ashamed in front of his friends. I did it to save him such embarrassment,' she added.

But surgeon Dr Metin Yilmaz - who carried out the op - said: 'I am astonished she would think that. The operation was a simple one and it was a complete success. There were no post-operative issues and he was due to go home.' 

Ms Sacan claimed she had paid for the surgery because her son had suffered years of bullying and teasing because of his large ears.

She added: 'I was trying to protect him from a lifetime of pain.'

After the boy's death Gazi Hospital chief surgeon Dr Kadri Altok added: 'We can't understand it. The boy's mother did not seem to have any psychological problems and the operation went perfectly.'

Ms Sacan is accused of taking her son to the women's toilet in the hospital in the early hours of the morning after his operation, where she chocked him to death with her own scarf.

She was caught when she fled the hospital in her car but hit another vehicle and confessed to the killing while she was being taken back to hospital in an ambulance. 

Police spokesman Alper Tore confirmed: 'A 37-year-old woman is in custody over the death of her son.'
