Barcelona expect to finalise a deal for Liverpool striker Luis Suarez over the next 48 hours.

Talks are ongoing and the Spanish club is concentrating on a straight cash deal for the 27-year-old who Liverpool value at £80million.

Suarez would be allowed to have a medical ahead of a transfer under the terms of his four-month ban for biting, FIFA's disciplinary chief has confirmed.

The Liverpool striker has been banned from all football-related activities including from stadiums, but it will not prevent him moving clubs if a transfer deal is agreed.

Claudio Sulser, the head of FIFA's disciplinary committee, said: 'The player cannot have any activity related to football, but a medical examination for a transfer yes - the sanction is not linked to transfer rights.'

Suarez has appealed against the four-month ban imposed for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini.

Wednesday's meeting between the two clubs in London was productive and cordial with sensible expectations placed on both sides.

Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre met with Barcelona power brokers Raúl Sanllehí, Toni Rossich and Jordi Mestre.

On Tuesday, Barcelona sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta publicly backed the shamed striker, smoothing the way for him to join Barcelona.

'Suarez had the honour to come out and apologise for his actions and now it's time for him to begin the recovery process,' Zubizarreta said at the Nou Camp as new signing Ivan Rakitic was unveiled.

Rakitic also had his say on the controversy, saying: 'To have the character and strength to apologise in front of the world shows what a noble person he is.'
