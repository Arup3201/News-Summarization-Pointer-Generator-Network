British rugby league commentator Eddie Hemmings has come under fire for mistaking Oscar-nominated actor Djimon Hounsou for Samuel L. Jackson live on TV.

Hemmings made the remark while commentating the World Club Challenge for Sky Sports on Sunday.

The camera panned to show actor Russell Crowe who was watching his team, 2014 NRL Champions the South Sydney Rabbitohs, take on St. Helen's in England with long-time friend Hounsou.

British rugby league commentator Eddie Hemmings has come under fire for joking that Oscar-nominated actor Djimon Hounsou looked like Samuel L. Jackson

Hemmings joked: 'Samuel L. Jackson alongside him, wasn't it? Looked like him. Maybe it was somebody doing an impersonation.'

The comments drew sharp criticism from viewers, who took to Twitter to accuse Hemmings of 'casual racism' and make fun of him for confusing two black actors.

'Can't believe Eddie Hemmings trotted out the "black guy looks like Samuel L Jackson" line. I mean, come on,' @MatthewRiley81.

'Eddie Hemmings utterly embarrassing himself on national TV once again…claiming his comments were tongue in cheek makes it worse #Dinosaur,' @SupernovaPhil88 tweeted.

But Hemmings hit back at his online detractors later in the game.

Hemmings said he 'tongue-in-cheek' suggested Hounsou looked a little bit like Samuel L. Jackson (pictured)

'Off the field we do have of course Russell Crowe with his Hollywood friends,' he said.

'The gentleman there who I tongue-in-cheek suggested looked a little bit like Samuel L. Jackson but I can tell you it's the man who played Juba in Russell Crowe's Oscar-winning movie The Gladiator.

'His names' Djimon Hounsou, he's an actor model from America, a big pal of Russell's, came up here on the helicopter ride with him and apparently social media has lit up with certain comments this evening.

'Pity some people don't have things better to do on a Sunday night but anyway there you are that's the record cleaned up for you and I hope that you're enjoying every second of this match here.'

But Twitter users continued to slam Hemmings, posting images of other famous black actors and musicians including Laurence Fishburne, Kerry Washington, Ice Cube and Chris Rock. 

Crowe decided to ditch the Oscars in favour of standing side by side with Sam Burgess to watch their team take on St. Helens in England for the World Club Challenge.

The 50-year-old was all smiles prior to the game, and his spirits lifted even higher when the 2014 NRL Champions defeated St. Helens 39-0.

Rusty wore his colours proud as he sported a green and red hooded letterman jacket to the game - which he traveled to via helicopter.

He was seen rubbing shoulders with Sam Burgess, who was cheering his brothers Tom and George on from the sidelines.

The actor and director seemed a bit concerned during some moments, but it wasn't long before the Rabbitohs took a dominating lead.

The Rabbitohs, of which Rusty is a co-owner, became the sixth NRL winners of the World Club Challenge, which sees the NRL champions take on the European Super League champions, in the last seven years. 

The Kiwi-Australian has been spending most of his time over in Los Angeles, where he's filming 2016 flick The Nice Guys alongside Ryan Gosling.
