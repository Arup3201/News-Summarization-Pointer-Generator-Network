A former NHS doctor has been accused of carrying out bungled and unhygienic circumcisions on children at their homes - leaving one baby boy screaming in agony after the anaesthetic wore off half way through the surgery.

Dr Mohammed Siddiqui, 49, of Southampton, faces misconduct charges over 47 allegations in relation to four boys that he carried out unhygienic procedures at the homes of four different youngsters  as part of a 'private mobile circumcision service'.

The GMC investigation was launched after a complaint by Kelly Braiha and her husband Ghali, from  West Sussex, claiming their 23-month-old son Najem was left 'traumatised' and suffering an infection because Siddiqui did not take hygienic precautions.

The allegations span a period from June 2012 until November 2013, during which time Dr Siddiqui was employed as a Clinical Fellow in paediatric surgery at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust.

A tribunal heard today that the doctor operated a private mobile children's circumcision service away from his  job at the hospital - but was accused by parents of not washing his hands prior to treatment and at times of not wearing surgical gloves, failing to carry out proper examinations and not having proper resuscitation equipment including oxygen and airway equipment.

It is claimed that when one little boy suffered an adverse reaction to local anaesthetic Siddiqui did not realise he was having a seizure and failed to act immediately to ensure an ambulance was called.

The tribunal heard during another procedure, a mother became concerned about her baby screaming and asked Dr Siddiqui questions - but it is alleged he pushed her hand away and said: 'leave him he's fine.' 

It is alleged he then pretended to take a telephone call to avoid answering further questions.

After the parent of a third circumcised boy rang Siddiqui to say his son was still in pain, it was claimed Siddiqui failed to respond and accused him of 'telling lies'

The parents of a fourth boy claim Siddiqui carried surgical materials in plastic carrier bags and used baby wipes and paper towels during the procedure, which was of such a poor standard he had to carry out another circumcision on the same child the following day.

Despite the boy suffering injuries from the operation as too much skin was removed, Dr Siddiqui failed to refer him to a hospital and then ignored his parents when they expressed concerns over his condition, it was claimed.

Following complaints it emerged Siddiqui had failing to secure valid insurance for each procedure and failed to register his circumcision service with the Care Quality Commission.

He was initially suspended from his post and stopped carrying out the procedures and has since resigned from the NHS and surrendered his GMC registration.

But at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service Siddiqui said he was contemplating starting up his circumcision business again and he even asked the panel to adjourn the case so he could earn money from the enterprise to fund his legal fees. The request was refused.

Male circumcision is widely practiced in Muslim communities and is not illegal in Britain.

As it is classed as 'consensual assault', similar to tattooing, anyone can legally carry it out.

Circumcision is only available through the NHS if there are compelling medical reasons, though local GP's may carry out the operation themselves.

Healthcare workers usually have to be registered with the CQC if they want to perform home circumcisions but there is no legal requirement.

The hearing was previously told the families of the boys from Southampton, Bath, Birmingham and Reading had wanted their children circumcised for religious or cultural reasons.

Ben Fitzgerald, counsel for the GMC,  said: 'He performed or attempted to perform circumcisions on four infant boys at their homes between June 2012 and November 2013. 

'At the time he was a paediatric surgeon but also in a private capacity operated a mobile children's circumcision service carrying out circumcisions in the community for parents who wished their sons to undergo them for religious or cultural reasons.

'Having been engaged he would attend their home addresses on the day bringing with him the equipment he needed to carry it out.

'He would obtain consent on the day and would leave behind information providing advice on aftercare. Ideally it would be quick and simple - meeting once and moving on.

'The GMC's case is that Mr Siddiqui's conduct in relation to the four patients fell below the standard required of a doctor carrying out procedures. 

'There was a lack of care when carrying out procedures, a rush to get them done and a lack of appropriate regard and respect for the parents who engaged his services.

'In relation to patients A, B and C, he failed to obtain properly informed consent. While he obtained a signature on a consent form and provided some information, his rush to perform the procedures and impatience in answering questions meant he did not engage properly with them.

'In October 2012, he treated Patient B's mother with a lack of respect, by pushing her hand away when she reacted to Patient B's scream at having his foreskin pulled back. In response to her alarm at his treatment of Patient B he said to her 'leave him, he's fine', or words to that effect.

'When questioned by Patient B's mother about the circumcision, he pretended that he had to take a telephone call to avoid answering her and when questioned further, Mr Siddiqui said "I'm not getting into this" and walked out of the house.'

Dr Siddiqui also failed to obtain adequate histories of each boy he was performed the procedure, it was said, as well as failing to make sure his equipment was aseptic.

Mr Fitzgerald added: 'Patient A appears to have suffered an adverse reaction to anaesthetisation and required an ambulance and emergency medical intervention. 

'Mr Siddiqui should not have administered a local anaesthetic without access to the minimum resuscitation facilities.

'He treated parents with a lack of respect - from failing to attend to their concerns to threatening and dishonest behaviour Patient C was screaming during a procedure, providing an indication that the anaesthetic was not working properly. 

'He should have stopped but he simply carried on. 

'You may hear evidence in the course of the hearing about the benefits of a surgeon providing the circumcision service to those who want it for religious reasons and conducting them at home.

'It is important to make clear it is not the GMC's case that he should not have been carrying out procedures in the home at all, rather that he failed in numerous respects to meet the basic standards that should be expected of any doctor operating in this environment.'

Siddiqui admits carrying out the procedures but denies that his practices were unhygienic or inadequate in any way.

He said: 'I've stopped doing circumcisions since I stopped getting correspondence from the CQC but I could.

'I do not need to register with the CQC when I'm suspended but I stopped it for numerous reasons.

'I still am not doing it but I know i can. I can restart doing circumcisions and can finance legal representation. I may start and finance the legal side of it.'

The hearing, expected to last up to four weeks, continues.
