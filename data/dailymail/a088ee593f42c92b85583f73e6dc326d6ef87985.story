It is not the most elegant of haircuts – as this startled-looking alpaca has probably realised. But in the hot days of summer he may be grateful to be shorn of his winter coat.

The South American animal is one of two kept by Nicola and Derek Waite at Baldersbury Hill Farm near Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland.

Farmers use the animals to keep the grass down and deter foxes trying to get their lambs, while the alpaca clippings are sold to make clothing.

The clippings can be used for luxury clothing and are worth in the region of £10 to £12 a kilo

Jackie Waugh travels up to 200 miles a day when he is shearing alpacas to keep them cool in the summer

The animals, Burns and Carruthers clipped by professional alpaca shearer Jackie Waugh, who travels up to 200 miles a day.

Waugh said: 'Shearing an alpaca is not a doddle. It takes a long time to learn how to do it properly.

'It takes two people to secure one to a board. We then fleece it and check their teeth, do their nails and give them any injections they are due.

'The whole job takes between 10 and 20 minutes per alpaca, but with the relatively low numbers involved it’s not about speed.

'It’s more important that we do a good job for the owner and be as gentle as possible with the alpaca. You have to keep the alpacas calm during the shearing process.

'It’s still only early June and I have already clipped over 150 alpacas. That won’t sound much to a sheep shearer, but a lot of the jobs I do are in twos and threes, with a lot of miles to cover in-between.'

Alpaca 
breeder and sheep farmer Jonathan Russell, from Ridge End Farm near 
Kielder Water, Northumberland, bred Burn and Carruthers, and helped make
 arrangements for the Waites to have the alpacas sheared.

'After shearing, the fibre is used for making luxurious clothing,' he explained.

'There is a ready market for alpaca fibre. People pay between £10-12 per kilo for raw alpaca fibre.'

Yet
 alpacas are also useful in other ways, helping landowners keep their 
grounds in good condition while also warding off unwanted intruders.
