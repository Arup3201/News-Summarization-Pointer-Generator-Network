When it comes to eating for Carpet Pythons, it’s about getting while the getting’s good.

Astonishing images have surfaced this week from a property in Queensland of a three-metre python devouring a possum whole while hanging from a tree.

The pictures, taken on Wednesday, illustrate the dramatic feeding methods of the enormous serpent.

Pythons are opportunistic feeders, meaning they seize any opening for a large meal by attempting to take it all in one go

Jasmine Kerr, who captured the photographs, said her mother stumbled upon the incredible scene.

‘My mum was moving some horses on her property in Gunalda. She was petrified, and told me to come down immediately.’

Kerr said she was comfortable getting up close to the Carpet Python since she owns her own as a pet. 

‘I was happy to get up close and just observe. It was pretty astonishing in person.’

Stuart Mckenzie, snake catcher at Sunshine Coast Snake and Reptile removal, said it was one of the largest snakes he had ever come across.

‘Occasionally we get a call from farms where snakes had broken into the chicken coop and eaten one of the birds, but this was pretty unusual. It’s one of the biggest snakes I've ever encountered.’

McKenzie said the pythons are opportunistic feeders, meaning they seize any opening for a large meal by attempting to take it all in one go.

‘The possum got a little too close. The snake has heat sensitive lips, making it easy to hunt down mammals in their range.’

The Pythons use their phenomenal muscle strength in their body to coil around, constrict and devour their pray while hanging upside down.

‘Their jaws are flexible and can take the prey in incrementally. The also squeeze their pray progressively harder to suffocate them. It would have taken about 30 minutes in total.’
