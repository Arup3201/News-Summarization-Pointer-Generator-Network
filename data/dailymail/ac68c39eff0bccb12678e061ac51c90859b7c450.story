With a price tag of more than £30billion, and a lavish opening ceremony broadcast around the globe, you might think that Sochi officials would have the basics covered.

The first official competition fall has yet to take place, but social media is already been awash with the failures of the Winter Olympics 2014.

Sochi
 has already had a bumpy start as journalist arrived to unfinished 
hotels, sewage spilling out of the taps and water ‘too dangerous to use 
on your face’ – and those were the lucky ones who got a room.

facility outside the Main Press Center at the 2014 Winter Olympics, in 
Sochi

Journalists
 checking in were left stunned as they arrived for bookings made last 
summer to be told they would have to wait indefinitely.

The few that did get rooms, were met with stray dogs, half-built walls, and toxic yellow water spitting from the sinks.

One
 hotel lobby had no floor - but staff had found time to hang a framed 
photo of Vladimir Putin, another group of reporters were told to wait a 
day for their room, which had no running water, no internet - and no 
door to access it.

Nearby,
 hotel managers advised guests not to splash water on their faces as it 
'contains something dangerous' and despite having booked 11 rooms five 
months ago, CNN's team were told to share one.

The
 Twitter account SochiProblems is posting and re-posting the experiences
 of athletes and members of the media as they poke fun at shared toilet 
cubicles, bathrooms with 'front row seats' and urinals that lack 
plumbing.

By Thursday 
afternoon, in just 24 hours, 26,000 tweets had been sent using the 
hashtag #SochiProblems, according to U.S. news anchor David Nelson.

A spokesman for Kozak later told the Wall Street Journal that the deputy premier had misspoke and there were no surveillance cameras inside hotel bathrooms

When confronted about the conditions in accommodations, Mr Kozak said he had proof of 'sabotage' on surveillance footage from hotel room

In response to the shocking conditions, deputy prime minister Kozak attempted to argue that the images and tweets were a deliberate attempt by journalists to paint Russia in a bad light

The shocking images and anecdotes comes after it emerged Russia exceeded its budget by millions and has ended up spending more than $52billion (£31.8billion) on the games

Embarrassing: Even the opening ceremony did not escape references to alleged paltry condition of Sochi's hotels, as one joker on Twitter pointed out

In
 response to the shocking conditions, deputy prime minister Kozak attempted to argue that the images and tweets were a 
deliberate attempt by journalists to paint Russia in a bad light.

When
 confronted about the conditions in accommodations, Mr Kozak said he had
 proof of 'sabotage' on surveillance footage from hotel rooms.

'We
 have surveillance video from the hotels that shows people turn on the 
shower, direct the nozzle at the wall and then leave the room for the 
whole day,' Mr Kozak said.

A
 spokesman for Kozak later told the Wall Street Journal that the deputy 
premier had misspoke and there were no surveillance cameras inside hotel
 bathrooms.

In a bid to make
 the area presentable to welcome in people from around the world, the 
animals are being fed poison on the streets and left to die.

The
 action, sanctioned by Putin, involves rounding up stray animals, 
feeding them poison, and leaving them on the streets to die.

The
 strategy has outraged animal rights activists - and baffled journalists
 arriving in Sochi this week who claim the city is brimming with ailing 
dogs.

The shocking images 
and anecdotes comes after it emerged Russia exceeded its budget by 
millions and has ended up spending more than $52billion (£31.8billion) 
on the games.

Meanwhile, a 
top U.S. counterterrorist official says there are 'a number of specific 
threats' aimed at the Winter Olympics- with the greatest danger coming 
from the Caucasus Emirate, which has threatened to attack the games.

Russia
 has mounted a massive security operation for the Olympics, deploying 
more than 50,000 police and soldiers amid threats from Muslim 
insurgents.

In response,  deputy prime minister 
Dmitry Kozak has said that the Olympics in Sochi will be 'just as safe 
as Boston', less than one year after the terrorist attack at the Boston 
Marathon.

The bombings 
at the Boston Marathon on April 15, killed three and injured an 
estimated 264 people, when two Chechen nationals, brothers Dzhokhar and 
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, detonated two pressure cooker bombs near the finish 
line.

Mr Kozak said Russia 
can guarantee the safety of people attending the Sochi Games as 
efficiently as any other government hosting a major event.

'I
 believe that warnings about Sochi, about Russia were superfluous, and 
the threat levels in Sochi are just like they are in Boston or London,' 
he said.

'I would like to reiterate that security in Sochi will be no worse than in New York, London, Washington or Boston.'

The Winter Olympics 2014 will kick off
 at the Black Sea resort of Sochi with a spectacular opening ceremony, 
the details of which are still shrouded in secrecy.

The
 opening ceremony starts at 4.14pm GMT (8.14pm local time) and will be 
attended by dozens of world leaders, however Barack Obama, Angela Merkel
 and British Prime Minister David Cameron are all notably absent.

The games will last for 16 days, and nearly 100 medals will be handed out to athletes from across the globe.

Sochi
 2014 organisers say 66 leaders, including heads of state and 
international organisations, will make an appearance the ceremony, with 
the United Nations' secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and the respective 
leaders of China and Japan joining Russian president Vladimir Putin in 
the VIP box.

The leaders of the U.S., Germany and the UK, as well as French President Francois Hollande, will not be attending.

A
 £32billion price tag demonstrates that no expense has been spared in 
staging the Games on the Black Sea coast, with impressive venues in the 
mountains and a compact purpose-built Olympic Park on the coast.

Around
 2,900 athletes are set to compete in 15 disciplines starting on 
Saturday, switching the focus from concerns over security, human rights 
and last-minute hitches to the sporting action.

The athletes hoping to take the spotlight from the logistics disaster, include Short Track speed skater Jon Eley who is Great Britain's flag bearer for the opening of a Games.

Team GB have been set a target of winning at least three medals in Sochi and Lizzy Yarnold, who tops the current skeleton rankings, is arguably the strongest bet to deliver.

Yarnold's Skeleton team-mate Shelley Rudman, the men's and women's curling teams skippered by David Murdoch and Eve Muirhead respectively, freestyle skiing slopestylers James Woods and Katie Summerhayes and short track speed skater Elise Christie are other strong medal prospects.

The host nation will also be determined to challenge towards the top of the medals table, having finished in a lowly 11th place in Vancouver.

Norway, Canada and the United States are most likely to be battling it out to top the medals table in Sochi.

Making their first appearance at the Winter Olympics will be women's ski jump, luge team relay and biathlon mixed relay, and five gold medals will be competed for on Saturday in snowboarding, where Britain's Jamie Nicholls will compete in the final, speedskating, biathlon, cross-country skiing and freestyle skiing.
