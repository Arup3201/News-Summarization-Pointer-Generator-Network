David Moyes' Real Sociedad were denied a first away win of the season after a penalty a piece shared the spoils at struggling Granada.

A Carlos Vela penalty in the first-half put Sociedad in control after Sergio Canales was hauled down in the box.

However Granada, who are without a La Liga win since September 20, equalised on 79 minutes with their own spot-kick from Fran Rico but head bottom of La Liga on goal difference.

Granada stopper Oier Olazabal was the busiest of the keepers in the first-half, smartly saving Sergio Canales' low drive from the left side of the box.

The Spanish midfielder then blazed over with a free shot after 20 minutes with the Granada defence nervously backing off as they struggled to deal with his pace.

Forward Lass Bangoura headed a glorious chance wide from a Granada corner as the home side managed to apply some rare pressure.

However Real Sociedad were soon back on the attack and Oier was forced into a point blank save from Inigo Martinez's powerful header.

Sociedad's dominance was rewarded after 35 minutes when they won a penalty. Claude Babin was adjudged to have held back Canales, with a dangerous cross heading towards the home goal, and referee Juan Martinez Munuera pointed to the spot.

Former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela took the initiative and sent Oier the wrong way to score his seventh goal of the season to ensure a half-time lead.

The lively Lass Bangoura inspired Granada to attack with more impetus in the second-half as the home side dominated proceedings.

Granada wasted several promising positions with Youssef El-Arabi guilty of heading over from close range before being jeered off by his own fans as he was substituted. 

Sociedad soaked up the pressure and rarely threatened to head forward as Granada grew in confidence. Right back Nyom rattled the post from long range for the home side before Ruben Pardo brought down Nyom in the box.

Fran Rico's tentative penalty crept in past Geronimo Rulli after 79 minutes to save a point for Granada to leave Moyes still searching for an away league win whereas the home side linger on the foot of the table.
