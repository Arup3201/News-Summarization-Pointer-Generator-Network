Jayne Goodwin died in hospital after falling from her horse Kali

A primary school teacher has died after she was thrown off a horse in a freak riding accident.

Jayne Goodwin, 44, had attempted to mount her six-year-old Freisian horse, Kali, during an evening ride with two friends in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

The horse suddenly bolted before Jayne had properly mounted. She was found bleeding and unconscious on the ground just yards from the stables.

Miss Goodwin suffered massive brain injuries and died three weeks after the accident when the decision was taken to switch off her life-support machine on January 29.

Her friend Georgie Adkin, 20, a law student who had been riding with Jayne for seven years, said: 'Kali was Jayne’s baby, she was her pride and joy. 'She knew she was a bit flighty and spooky but she always said she wouldn’t have her any other way.

'Jayne had dismounted to open and shut the gate behind us as we were making our way back to the stables.

'Kali had got into this terrible habit of starting to move off on that final stretch as Jayne was mounting because she was eager to get back and have tea.

'So on that night she did that as usual, and Jayne even laughed as Kali started to move when she was just half on, then she went faster and Jayne said: ‘Oh Christ, she’s going’.

'Jayne was sat in the saddle but she didn’t have the right stirrup on.

'I have no idea what happened next because it was so dark.

Single Jayne, 44, suffered massive brain injuries and died three weeks after the accident when the decision was taken to switch off her life-support machine.

Jayne was wearing a helmet and body protector in the fall and a friend described her as 'the most safety conscious person I have met.

'I heard Jayne fall but she did not make a noise, I think that she was maybe harmed on the way down, which may explain why she had fractures to her left cheek.'

Since the accident on January 9 Ms Adkin has been staying at Miss Goodwin’s home in Wakefield so she can look after and help re-home her many animals including her six cats, three dogs and three gerbils.

Miss Goodwin had seven horses and six will now remain in Miss Adkin’s care at Jayne’s Springs Wood Black Horses Stables.

Kali is currently being looked after at a black Freisian specialists in the Lake District.

Jayne was a primary school teacher at Half Acres School in Castleford, West Yorkshire

Ms Adkin added: 'The ironic thing is Jayne knew of the dangers and was the most safety conscious person I have met.

'She always wore a body protector in case of a fall, and she was even wearing a new helmet that night.

'She was the most kind hearted person I’ve ever met. I don’t think I will ever know generosity like hers again.'

Miss Goodwin, originally of Stockton-on-Tees, was a teacher at Half Acres school in Castleford, West Yorks., she is survived by her parents Audrey, 76, and Frank, 82.

An inquest into her death was opened and adjourned by Wakefield Coroner's Court this week.
