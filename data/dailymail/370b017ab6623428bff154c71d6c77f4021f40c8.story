The best city in the world for having fun is Berlin - which also serves the cheapest beer, according to a new survey.

Statistics revealed the German capital was the top city for young people, while London came in second, Paris third and New York fourth.

Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the city is now considered the best city in the world to visit for a good time.

In research that judged 1,800 cities on quality of restaurants, bars, adult entertainment, museums and shopping, as well as cost of a beer and time of last orders, the UK capital was deemed to have the best clubbing and concerts. 

Young travellers in particular favour travelling to Berlin for its nightlife, with the city ranking top for the price of beer served and winning out overall in terms of 'fun'

City of fun: Berlin has been deemed the top city for fun, according to new research

While Berlin was applauded for having no 'last call' time and the lowest price of beer, it didn't win any other categories. 

GetYourGuide analysed reviews on 17 different websites including TripAdvisor, Yelp and Time Out to compile ‘The Ultimate Fun City Ranking’.

Paris came in at number three on the list, despite not leading in any of the categories. 

Best clubs and concerts: London ranked second, according to reviews across 17 websites

New York, in fourth position, was considered best for activities, while Tokyo, ranked the fifth most fun, has the best bars and shopping. 

GetYourGuide CEO Johannes Reck said: ‘The research pulled out answers that were both expected and unexpected. We all thought either London or New York would come top of the shopping category; however they were beaten by Tokyo. 

'The research also captured what a great, all-rounded city London is. Not only is it known for being one of the best cities for clubs and concerts, but it also has great museums, sports clubs and bars.

'This being said, one downfall of London is that it’s one of the most expensive places listed to buy a pint, making it a less attractive place to socialise. 

Bangkok came out on top for having the best 'adult entertainment', closely followed by Tokyo and New York. 

Interestingly, cities traditionally considered party hubs such as Amsterdam, Las Vegas, and Rio de Janeiro ranked lower, in 12th, 15th and 18th positions respectively, behind others including Hamburg, Vienna, and Istanbul.
