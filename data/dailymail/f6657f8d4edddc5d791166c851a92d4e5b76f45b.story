Thief: Diane Caswell has been barred from 27 stores because of her 13-year shoplifting campaign

A shameless mother of three has been banned from stores in five different towns after waging a 13 year campaign of shoplifting.

Diane Caswell, 38, would get the bus or train to high streets across the North of England and fill numerous bags with clothes, cosmetics and toys.

The former school cleaner has racked up scores of theft convictions and has has been in and out of jail since being first convicted in 2000.

She was hauled back into court and made subject of her second ASBO on Monday after CCTV images showed her with two girls filling four bags with toys during a thieving spree at 16 stores.

After her arrest Caswell said: 'I hate what I am.'

Today Lancashire Police said Caswell had been barred from a total of 27 stores in Blackburn, Clitheroe, Nelson, Darwen and Accrington.

She is also not allowed to go into Blackburn's town centre shopping area unless it is for pre-arranged dental appointments for herself, or her children, or to go to meetings with her solicitors and the probation service.

The ASBO will last for two years and Caswell will face up to five years in jail if she is caught breaching it.

Caswell began her shoplifting spree when she was single and bringing up her three children.

She stole designer clothes from a store in Burnley complaining that she could not afford for her daughter to go on a school trip.

She said her eldest child had also wanted designer clothes and she was not in a position to provide them.

In October 2000 she was given a conditional discharge but she went on a prolific thieving spree and was later given her first ASBO banning her from Blackburn's shopping area.

No entry: Lancashire Police said Caswell had 
been barred from a total of 27 stores in Blackburn, (town centre is pictured) Clitheroe, Nelson, 
Darwen and Accrington

No go: Accrington (pictured) is among the towns with shops that Caswell is banned from. She would get the bus or the train to high streets across the North of England and fill bags with clothes, cosmetics and toys

But in 2010 she was back before the court
after she flouted the order when security staff spotted her in a budget
store in the town.

Caswell, from Blackburn, was later arrested again then bailed with a condition not to enter shops or stores only to go on a further shoplifting spree within 48 hours stealing toys and greetings cards.

Last March Caswell was caught again stealing £300 worth of mascara from a Boots store after travelling to Skipton in North Yorkshire, with friends.

She went to jail and was treated at Styal women's prison for addiction but after being released went shoplifting at 16 different stores.

Caswell is banned from stores in Nelson (pictured) too. She was handed a second Asbo on Monday after CCTV images showed her with two girls filling four bags with toys during thieving spree at 16 shops

Arrested: She's also banned from shops in Darwen (pictured) in Lancashire. She has scores of convictions and has been in and out of court since her first conviction in 2000

Stealing: Shops in Clitheroe are also out of bounds for Caswell who admitted seven charges of theft this week

Last month when she appeared before Blackburn magistrates to admit seven charges of theft and ask for nine others to be considered.

Her lawyer Andrew Church-Taylor said 'Through her addiction, she has lost her children, her dignity and her self-respect.

'She has, in effect, lost everything. When I spoke to her in the cells, she told me she hates what she is and wants to change.'

Monday's ASBO hearing at the same court came as police recorded an increase in shoplifting in Blackburn and Darwen.

They said that in the six months up to October 2012, there were 620 cases. The number rose to 659 during the same period this year.

Officers said they were targeting other prolific shoplifters.

After the case Inspector Abid Khan said: 'We are really pleased that this ASBO has been issued. It is unfair on the majority of the paying public that a minority targets these shops because they think they can get away with it.

'We are determined to do as much as we can to bring them to justice, and put conditions on them.'
