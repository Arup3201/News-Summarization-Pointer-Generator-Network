A family is outraged as officials from Habersham County, Georgia say they won’t foot the $800,000 medical bills they 'publicly promised to pay' for a toddler injured by a grenade during a police raid.

Bounkham Phonesavanh, known as 'Baby Bou Bou', was 19 months old when he was seriously injured by a grenade that went off in his crib as he slept during an early morning drug raid on May 28.

'They had made it publicly known that they were going to take care of any medical expenses that our son had acquired,' said the boy's mother Alecia Phonesavanh.

Healing: Bounkham Phonesavanh, who was 19 months when injured by a grenade during a drug raid, is healing but the county says they wont foot the medical bills

Disfigured: Surgeons repaired the boy's lung so he no longer needs a ventilator and patched and re-attached his nose that had been detached as well as repaired injuries to his lips and mouth

Come a long way: Baby Bou Bou has improved greatly since he was first injured in May during the raid

'That is a very big problem,' said Phonesavanh to Fox.

'And my family and I want to make it clear to the county and everybody elsethat we will not give up this fight.'

The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reports that SWAT officers threw the grenade into his room during a search warrant for a drug suspect.

On Friday 
afternoon the family's attorney said that the medical bills are piling 
up and the county is not taking responsibility for them.

'But at this point, the county is refusing to pay,' said attorney Muwali Davis.

The 
attorney for Habersham County stated, 'The question before the board was
 whether it is legally permitted to pay these expenses. After
 consideration of this question following advice of counsel, the board 
of commissioners has concluded that it would be in violation of the law 
for it to do so.'

Baby Bou Bou is doing much better after recovering at two different hospitals and was able to go home with his family in July.

The little boy looks dramatically better than in the shocking picture released after the horrific incident which caused a brain injury, collapsed a lung and disfigured his face.

Surgeons repaired the boy’s lung so he no longer needs a ventilator and patched and re-attached his nose that had been detached by the explosion as well as repaired injuries to his lips and mouth.

He also lost his left nipple. The medical bills continue to pile up as he recovers,

The Phonesavahs' attorney also makes the point that police may have received false information in order to gain a search warrant into their home.

A Habersham County sheriff said that back in June an informant told them that they bought drugs at the house but that they didn't think any children lived there.

In the wake of the incident, Boo Boo's mom Alecia Phonesavanh has spoken out about abuse of power by police officers.

The target: Law enforcement threw a grenade into Baby Bou Bou's family residence

The incident had occurred while she was staying with her husband, their three daughters and their baby son in the living room of her sister-in-law's home just outside of Atlanta after their Wisconsin home burnt down.

The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reports that they didn't find who they were looking for in the home and that an ongoing investigation in underway.

Baby Bou Bou and his family have moved back to Wisconsin and supporters of the family are planning a fundraiser for the boy in August.

'This is happening every day to people [who are] being relentlessly and unnecessarily militarized by police who think just because they're supposed to be upholding the law, they are above the law themselves,' said Bou Bou's mother.

'It’s time to remind the cops that they should be serving and protecting our neighborhoods, not waging war on the people in them.

Before the injury: Before Baby Bou Bou was struck by a grenade, he was a happy and healthy boy
