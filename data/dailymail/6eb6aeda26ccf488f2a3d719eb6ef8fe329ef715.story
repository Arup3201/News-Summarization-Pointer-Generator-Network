Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich is stepping down as CEO following protests over his support of a gay marriage ban in California.

The Mountain View, California-based nonprofit maker of the Firefox browser infuriated many employees and users last week by promoting Eich.

At issue was Eich's $1,000 donation in 2008 to the campaign to pass California's Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that outlawed same-sex marriages.

The ban was overturned when the U.S. Supreme Court last year left in place a lower-court ruling striking down the ballot measure.

The contribution had drawn some negative attention in the past but took on more weight when he was named CEO.

Prop 8: Mozilla's new CEO, Brendan Eich, supported California's proposed ban on gay marriage

Mozilla employees and users criticized the move online. Dating website OKCupid replaced its usual homepage for users logging in with Firefox, the world's third-most-popular Web browser, with a note suggesting they not use Mozilla's software to access the site.

Mozilla Chairwoman Mitchell Baker apologized for the company's actions in an open letter online Thursday, saying that Eich is stepping down for the company's sake.

'We didn't act like you'd expect Mozilla to act. We didn't move fast enough to engage with people once the controversy started. We're sorry. We must do better,' Baker wrote.

She said that Mozilla believes both in equality and freedom of speech and that 'figuring out how to stand for both at the same time can be hard.'

Mozilla is still discussing what is next for its leadership.

A representative for Mozilla could not be reached immediately for further comment.

Mozilla says about half a billion people around the world use Firefox, which has free, open software written in part by volunteers. Google's Chrome browser and Microsoft's Internet Explorer are more widely used across desktops, tablets and phones.

Boycott: OKCupid posted this note to users on its website on Monday, urging users to boycott Mozilla

Mozilla infuriated many employees and users last week by hiring Eich to lead the Mountain View company.

His
 political contribution was publicly reported and drew some negative 
attention two years ago, when Eich was Mozilla's chief technology 
officer. But when he was promoted to CEO last week, his support of the 
ban took on more gravitas.

Three
 of the Mozilla Foundation's six board members quit, according to a Wall
 Street Journal blog, and thousands of employees and community members 
weighed in on Twitter last weekend.

On Monday, New York-based dating service OkCupid.com replaced its usual home page for users logging in with Firefox.

'Hello
 there, Mozilla Firefox user. Pardon this interruption of your OkCupid 
experience. Mozilla's new CEO, Brendan Eich, is an opponent of equal 
rights for gay couples. We would therefore prefer that our users not use
 Mozilla software to access OkCupid,' the message says.

OkCupid
 President Christian Rudder said he and the firm's three other 
co-founders decided to post the message after discussing Eich's 
appointment over the weekend.

He said 12 percent of OkCupid's approximately 3 billion monthly page views come through Firefox, while 8 percent of the site's users are gay or lesbian.

'We don't think this was the right thing for people to donate money to, and this is someone we do business with so we decided to take action,' Rudder said.

Inequality: California's Proposition 8 essentially banned same-sex couples from getting married until it was deemed unconstitutional

  I am deeply honored and humbled by the CEO role. I’m also grateful for the messages of support. At the same time, I know there are concerns about my commitment to fostering equality and welcome for LGBT individuals at Mozilla. I hope to lay those concerns to rest, first by making a set of commitments to you. More important, I want to lay them to rest by actions and results.A number of Mozillians, including LGBT individuals and allies, have stepped forward to offer guidance and assistance in this. I cannot thank you enough, and I ask for your ongoing help to make Mozilla a place of equality and welcome for all. Here are my commitments, and here’s what you can expect:    -Active commitment to equality in everything we do, from employment to events to community-building.    -Working with LGBT communities and allies, to listen and learn what does and doesn’t make Mozilla supportive and welcoming.    -My ongoing commitment to our Community Participation Guidelines, our inclusive health benefits, our anti-discrimination policies, and the spirit that underlies all of these.    -My personal commitment to work on new initiatives to reach out to those who feel excluded or who have been marginalized in ways that makes their contributing to Mozilla and to open source difficult. More on this last item below. I know some will be skeptical about this, and that words alone will not change anything. I can only ask for your support to have the time to “show, not tell”; and in the meantime express my sorrow at having caused pain.Mozilla is a movement composed of different people around the world, working productively together on a common mission. This is important to our ability to work and grow around the world.Many Mozillians and others know me as a colleague or a friend. They know that I take people as they come and work with anyone willing to contribute. At the same time, I don’t ask for trust free of context, or without a solid structure to support accountability. No leader or person who has a privileged position should. I want to be held accountable for what I do as CEO. I fully expect you all to do so.I am committed to ensuring that Mozilla is, and will remain, a place that includes and supports everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, economic status, or religion.You will see exemplary behavior from me toward everyone in our community, no matter who they are; and the same toward all those whom we hope will join, and for those who use our products. Mozilla’s inclusive health benefits policies will not regress in any way. And I will not tolerate behavior among community members that violates our Community Participation Guidelines or (for employees) our inclusive and non-discriminatory employment policies.You’ll also see more from Mozilla under my leadership in the way of efforts to include potential contributors, especially those who lack privilege. This entails several projects, starting with Project Ascend, which is being developed by Lukas Blakk. I intend to demonstrate with meaningful action my commitment to a Mozilla that lives up to its ideals, including that of being an open and inclusive community.

Mozilla, which is promoted with the 
slogan, 'Doing good is part of our code,' responded Monday with an 
emailed statement saying the company supports equality for all, 
including marriage equality for gay couples.

'No matter who you are or who you love, everyone deserves the same rights and to be treated equally,' said the statement. 'OkCupid never reached out to us to let us know of their intentions, nor to confirm facts.'

On his personal website, Eich posted a note titled 'Inclusiveness at Mozilla,' in which he promises an 'active commitment to equality in everything we do.'

Mozilla says about half a billion people around the world use Firefox, which has free, open software written in part by volunteers. Firefox has been losing market share to Google Inc.'s Chrome browser in recent years.
