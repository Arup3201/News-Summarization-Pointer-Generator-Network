A greyhound owned by champion jockey AP McCoy has tested positive for the same steroid used by shamed sprinter Ben Johnson.

A sample taken from Kereight King after he trialled at Wimbledon last month tested positive for Stanozolol, the drug used by disgraced Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni.

Distancing himself from the the news, McCoy said: 'I have no input as I was given a share in it and I have never actually seen it run.'

Straight from the horse's mouth: McCoy has distanced himself from reports of the failed test

Kereight King, trained in Ireland by Pat Curtin, was 12-1 second favourite for the William Hill Greyhound Derby after the trial which almost smashed the track record.

No date has been set for the hearing into the positive test but a fine of £5,000 could be slapped on the Kereight King team.

A spokesman for the Greyhound Board of Great Britain said: ‘The GBGB can confirm that a urine sample was taken from the greyhound Kereight King on April 12 after it trialled at Wimbledon Stadium when in the care of trainer Mr Pat Curtin from Ireland and has been analysed by LGC Health Sciences and found to contain the substance 6a-hydroxystanozolol, a metabolite of Stanozolol.

‘This matter will be heard before the Disciplinary Committee of the GBGB in due course.’

McCoy, successful on Irish Buccaneer at Ludlow on Sunday, was not involved in the chaos at the start which prompted the second race, a three-mile chase, to be declared void.

The starter could be seen waving his flag, suggesting a false start, after the field had set off seemingly in unison, but there was no flag from the recall man at the first fence and it was only after some time that the riders pulled their mounts up.

DERMOT WELD’S Fascinating Rock is 14-1 for the Derby after rightly being awarded victory in the Derrinstown Stud Derby trial at Leopardstown after first-past-the-post Ebanoran badly bumped him in the final furlong.
