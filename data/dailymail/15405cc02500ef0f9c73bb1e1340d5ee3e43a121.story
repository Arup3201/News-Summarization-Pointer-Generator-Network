He said it was his job to 'seduce, amuse and entertain'. And a now a new exhibit shows how the legendary fashion photographer Helmut Newton succeeded on all three fronts.

From this Saturday dozens of his glamorous color and monochrome images, taken between the mid-Sixties and late Seventies, will go on display at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles.

The selection features several of his greatest hits, including a provocative image of a woman on a bed wearing a riding saddle.

Another shows a model wearing stockings and suspenders reclining on a sofa with her back to the camera to reveal the full length of her thighs.

Newton's iconic 1981 self-portrait is also set to tantalize gallery-goers. It shows the reflection of him in a mirror as he photographs a nude model. His wife June watches on as she sits to one side.

The photographs were made specifically made for the exhibition and produced in large-scale format - some reaching nearly six-feet-high.

All were selected from three of Newton's popular coffee table books - White Women (1976), Sleepless Nights (1978), and Big Nudes (1981).

David Fahey, a gallery owner and a longtime friend of Newton's, described his images as 'sexually charged' and 'edgy'. 'I like to call them 
mini-narratives,' he explained.

'They’re stories within a story. And they’re stories that
 say: "Women can be as powerful and as dominating as men. And sexual 
curiosity is normal."'

Several black-and-white images Mr Fahey took of Newton are included in the display, which will run until September 8.

Striking: Newton preferred to shoot his photographs in streets or interiors rather than studios - this image was taken in 1975 in Rue Aubriot, Paris

the upscale Hollywood hotel Chateau Marmont, where he and his wife used 
to winter every year.

In addition to the more than 100 prints displayed, the exhibit will feature two films about Newton.

Helmut by June, a documentary film 
shot and directed by June Newton, Newton's wife of 56 years, shows him behind-the-scenes on shoots with models Cindy Crawford and Helena Christensen.

It also provides an intimate glimpse
 into his private life and the couple's remarkable relationship.

Additionally, the Annenberg Space
 for Photography has commissioned an original documentary film titled Provocateur, which examine the cameraman's impact on fashion, women and photography.

Wallis Annenberg, CEO of the Annenberg Foundation, said of Newton: 'If Newton's work was controversial, I believe it's because he expressed the contradictions within all of us, and particularly within the women he photographed so beautifully: empowerment mixed with vulnerability, sensuality tempered by depravity.

'Newton deepened our understanding of changing gender roles, of the ways in which beauty creates its own kind of power and corruption. 

'On top of that, his compositions were brilliantly precise, cinematic in their scope and in their storytelling.'

Signature style: The photographer became known for his use of bold lighting, controversial scenarios and striking compositions - he is pictured here in 1981

Newton, neé Neustädter, was born in Berlin and was of Jewish heritage. In 1938 he was forced to flee the Nazis before the First World War.

Finding his way to Australia some years later, he changed his name to Newton and embarked upon the photography career.

At the age of 36, he landed his first commission with Vogue, and went on to work with dozens of publications including Playboy.

He became known for his use of bold lighting, 
controversial scenarios and striking compositions.

In his later life, he lived in both Monte Carlo and Los Angeles. He died as a result of a car accident on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood  in 2004, aged 84.
