Colin Williams, 36, (pictured) of Swindon, has been jailed for three and a half years after pleading guilty to theft and fraud - he stole almost a quarter of a million pounds from his clients and employers 

An accountant who fiddled his firm's books and stole more than £200,000 from his clients and employers has been jailed after pleading guilty to theft and fraud.

Colin Williams, 36, of Russley Close, Peatmoor, in Swindon, treated himself to two or three luxury breaks a year with money he stole from the chartered accountants where he worked.

He had not yet unpacked from his latest expensive holiday to Honolulu when police arrested him.

Richard Williams, defending, said his client had lost everything as a result of his offending, as his wife and step children left him and he had lost his job and pension.

He told Swindon Crown Court: 'He certainly hopes that the firm can survive. He stands before you extremely ashamed and publicly humiliated.'

The court heard Williams, 36, was employed as a partner by chartered accountants SD Knee in Swindon, Wiltshire, but had lied about his credentials.

He had told bosses he was a member of the Chartered Institute of Taxation.

Williams fiddled the books and stole the fees paid to the firm, cash meant to pay the company's Corporation tax and stole money given to him by clients to go to the taxman.

He also kept money meant for six colleagues' life insurance, which was part of their pay package.

Williams was eventually caught when his boss, Simon Knee, noticed invoices for work he had already done himself.

Williams produced doctored bank statements in an attempt to show it was a one-off, but Mr Knee found more discrepancies and called the police.

On his LinkedIn account Williams describes himself as an 'experienced UK tax professional'.

His online CV, which still lists him as still working at S D Knee, states he was previously a tax consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Williams goes on to claim he started his 'career in tax' in 1996 after completing a degree in Taxation and Revenue Law at Bournemouth University.

His profile adds: 'After working for a mid tier independent firm for many years as a Manager, where he eventually became the Head of Tax Services, Colin was appointed Tax Partner at S D Knee Chartered Accountants in June 2007.

Williams used the money to go on luxury holidays several times a year, including one to Hawaii (file picture)

When police officers arrived at Williams' home he had not even unpacked his bags from a trip to Honolulu.

He initially accepted taking just £34,000, but detectives uncovered more evidence and eventually discovered he stole a total of £218,025.87.

Travel agents told investigators that Williams was taking two or three holidays each year.

Williams pleaded guilty to three counts of theft and three of fraud. 

Judge Peter Blair jailed Williams for three and a half years and said: 'As you know, prison follows when people take money of this sort of quantity.

'That has been used on expenditure that has helped sustain a rather more lavish lifestyle than you would have been able to enjoy, particularly to luxuriant, expensive holidays that you were able to take.'
