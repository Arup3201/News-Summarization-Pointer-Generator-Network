From hoovering to scrubbing the toilet, it was recently revealed that women spend a year and a half of their lives cleaning the house.

But imagine a device that could do it all for you at the push of a button.

Your wildest domestic dreams could one day become a reality thanks to an innovative new concept called The Mab – an automated cleaning system that scans the house for dirty areas and sends mini robots flying around to clean up.

It's not rolling into production quite yet, but the idea did win this year’s Electrolux Design Lab competition.

A lazy girl's dream? The Mab, which was envisioned by a young designer, is an automated cleaning system that scans the house for dirty areas and sends mini robots flying around to clean up

Colombian designer, Adrian Perez Zapata, took home first place at this weekend’s event - a global design competition open to undergraduate and graduate design students to present innovative ideas for the future.

The Mab is a circular unit that scans your home before sending its army of 908 tiny flying robots off to clean the place from top to bottom.

Each of the mini robots would be powered by solar technology, to generate clean energy while they’re cleaning and deodorising.

The robots polish surfaces by touching them with a drop of water.

‘I was in my university gardens when I observed the controlled flight of bees pollinating a flower, and how magical it is to see swarms of bees working together,’ Perez Zapata said.

‘My concept Mab only requires a short initial configuration to function autonomously, so you could arrive home and see a swarm of mini-robots roaming around cleaning independently.

‘This means you could sit back and relax, as you observe with great astonishment the little Mab “fairies” working their magic.’

Stefano Marzano, Chief Design Officer at Electrolux and Head of Jury, said: ‘This year’s winning concept renews the idea of looking at the robot, seeing it not as one unit that mimics a person, but instead as something inspired by the magical logic of nature’s collaborative efforts and group intelligence.

‘The Mab is an innovative concept which could be relevant to minimise the daily cleaning efforts of consumers as well as businesses, while maximising the results.’

And it seems that domestic drudges are enthused by The Mab: it received 40 per cent of the 4391 public votes on the Design Lab website, making it the People's Choice Award winner.

Adrian Perez Zapata took home 5,000 euros from the competition in Stockholm, Sweden, and also won a six-month paid internship at an Electrolux global design centre.

The second prize in the competition went to Luiza Silva from Brazil who created the Atomium 3D food printer, a device that uses molecular ingredients to construct food layer by layer.

The product aims to help children prepare their own food in a fun and interactive way.

Children can draw the shape of the food they would like to eat, show it to the appliance which then detects this information and prints food in the desired shape as well as choosing molecular ingredients to construct the ideal nutritional balance for user’s body.

Third prize went to Jeabyun Yeon from
 Korea for the Breathing Wall, an air cleaning concept for people who live in urban areas.

According
 to Electrolux, the idea of the design competition is to 'stimulate and 
activate design students on a global level by inviting them to present 
breakthrough ideas for future household environments.'

The theme of this year's Design Lab was Inspired Urban Living.

'Living areas are smaller; there is less storage but the home still needs to be the epicentre of entertaining and culinary enjoyment. The competitors were asked to submit concepts for products, accessories, consumables and services that would be seen as a breakthrough within the sector of Social Cooking, Natural Air or Effortless Cleaning,' explained a spokesperson for Electrolux.

Over 1700 submissions from over 60 countries around the world flew in and the competition was conducted in five stages: submitting an idea and a sketch, concept development, visual development, functionality development and the final event presentation.

Over 100 concepts were chosen to take part in the competition to develop their concepts further and to be evaluated by Electrolux professionals from Design, R&D and Marketing Innovation.
