Four soldiers in an iconic First World War image that was widely used for morale-boosting posters and postcards have finally been identified.

The official war photograph - titled 'Tommy at home in German dugouts' - shows soldiers from the Border Regiment resting in a trench during a lull in the Somme offensive in 1916.

Very little was known about the origins of the picture, however, until a relative of one of the men saw the image in coverage of the recent First World War centenary, and came forward to confirm his identity.

Sylvia Nichol, from Over Kellet, near Carnforth, Lancashire, said the sergeant on the left of the picture was her grandfather Norman Park, who was born in nearby Kendal.

She named the other men in the trench as, from left, L/Cpl Tattersall, Dan Daly and E Carradice.

The only person she had no name for was a soldier laid across the top of the dugout, who was cropped out of the photograph when it was used as a postcard by the Ministry of Information.

Mrs Nichol believed the photograph was taken at Ovillers on the Somme in July 1916 - although the Imperial War Museum dates the image a month later.

The Battle of the Somme took place between July 1 and November 18, 1916 in the Somme area of France

It began with an offensive by British and French forces against the Germans, which, since invading France in August 1914, had occupied large areas of the country.

The Allies gained little ground over the four-month battle - just five miles in total by the end.

The battle is controversial because of the tactics employed, and is also historically significant as tanks were used for the first time.

On the first day of fighting the British lost more than 19,000 men, rising to 420,000 in total. 

By the time fighting ceased there were more than 1 million casualties, including 650,000 Germans.

With the British troops posing in captured German trenches, the photograph was adopted for morale-boosting propaganda and given the title 'Tommy at home in German dugouts'.

'I sort of knew about the photo years ago before I ever saw a copy,' said Mrs Nichol, who remembered Mr Park as 'a happy smiling granddad'.

'My dad told the tale of when he came home on leave in the Second World War from Belgium or Germany. He got off the train at Euston station and looking out at him from a poster on the wall was his old man.'

Mrs Nichol's sister Sue Streadwick, who emigrated to Canada, was also aware of the picture and for years has had a copy hanging in her home.

She said: 'I was raised by my grandfather, so have memories of him as a stern father-figure, more than as a soldier.

'He was born in Kendal, the seventh and youngest son in a family of nine children. His father ran a building business and built the houses on Park Street and vicinity.

'He took part in the Battle of the Somme and suffered gas poisoning. He was sent home as an invalid, and often lamented that he had an 'easy way out' of the war.

'When World War Two came around, he joined the Territorial Army and held the rank of captain.'

Mrs Streadwick added that he had two children and worked at Ibis engineering as a purchaser. 

He drank at the Ring O' Bells, loved cricket, grew vegetables, was a Mason and was 'an active and caring grandfather'.
