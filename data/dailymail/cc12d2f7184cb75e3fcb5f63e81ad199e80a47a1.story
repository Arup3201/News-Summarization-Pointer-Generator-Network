New taxes will be levied on betting and Premier League football clubs to fund more school and community sport if Labour wins power.

Shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman will today insist there should be a ‘proper levy’ on top clubs’ revenue from the sale of their television rights to help develop grassroots football.

A new tax on all sports betting – similar to that already levied on horseracing – would help pay to reintroduce two hours of sport for every primary school child.

Critics warned Labour’s move could mean football clubs clawing back the cost through higher ticket prices, and said the last government had done more than any other to encourage gambling by liberalising the law.

But Miss Harman will insist today Labour is prepared to ‘get tough’ with wealthy football clubs and betting firms if it wins the general election in nine months’ time.

Currently, there is a levy of ten per cent the gross profits made by betting companies from betting on horseracing, raising £82 million this year. This money is ploughed is issued in grants to improve the sport.

The Government has already announced a change law to extend the horserace betting levy to overseas bookmakers, who are currently exempt.

But Miss Harman, speaking at an event to sports leaders at the London Aquatics Centre in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, will suggest the tax should be extended to all sports betting.

She will also propose that a five per cent voluntary levy on TV revenues agreed by the Premier League to support grassroots football in 2001 should be toughened. Labour claims the sums actually going to grassroots clubs and teams has fallen short.

‘People across the country are passionate about sport whether it’s them or their children taking part or watching it at events or on television. It’s also important to public policy because of the many physical and mental health benefits that it provides people of all ages,’ Labour’s deputy leader will say.

Labour argues that child participation in sport has slipped back since the eyes of the world were on London's Olympic Park, pictured

‘We were all proud to host the Olympics and Paralympic Games in London two years ago but instead of seeing increased participation, things have got worse especially amongst young people as a result of the government axing school sports partnerships.

‘Labour wants to help everybody to do more sport and physical activity – from children to the elderly, girls and well as boys and people from all backgrounds and regions.  

‘Our consultation looks at a number of ideas which aim to boost investment in community and grassroots sports by getting tough with the Premier League and betting companies, bringing back two hours of sport at schools a week and encouraging more people to take part – girls as well as boys.’

Clive Efford, shadow minister for sport, said: ‘If we are going to get more people active then we have to empower the people who do most of the work in our communities to have more influence over how we plan, organise and deliver sport and physical education at local level.’

Sallie Barker, head of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, said: ‘We would welcome a strong focus on ensuring a quality experience for every child in every school, rather than purely focusing on structural change.

‘The flexibility of the school sport premium allows schools to pool their money and, where it suits them, to replicate school sport partnerships.

'But in other places, where other arrangements suit pupils better, those too can be funded. The strength of this is that it allows teachers to choose what is best in their area, for their children, rather than superimposing a one-size-fits-all approach.’

A Conservative spokesman said: ‘This is yet another short-term gimmick from Labour. It is a tax on football fans which will mean higher ticket prices for ordinary people wanting to watch our national sport.

‘The evidence is clearer than ever that Ed Miliband is out of touch with hardworking taxpayers and doesn’t have a long-term plan for Britain.’
