A blog post titled '5 Reason To Date A Girl With An Eating Disorder' has drawn thousands of angry tweets and offended comments from both men and women, as well as medical experts.

Posted by Return of Kings, a website for heterosexual and 'masculine' men, the blog post outlines five reasons why dating a woman with an eating disorder is beneficial to men: 'Her obsession over her body will improve her overall looks' and 'She costs less money,' it states.

Since it went live on November 13, the writer has been accused of 'dangerously and absurdly' trivializing the disease, which affects 20 million women and 10 million men in the U.S., according to the National Eating Disorders Association.

Author Tuthmosis says people offended by his blog advising men to date women with eating disorders need to get 'perspective'

'It trivializes the illness -- and it is 
an illness, it’s a disorder,' Dr Robyn Silverman, body-image expert and
 author of Good Girls Don’t Get Fat: How Weight Obsession Is Messing Up
 Our Girls and How We Can Help Them Thrive Despite It, told Yahoo! 
Shine. 'People make jokes about a lot of things, though. And bottom line
 is, it’s not funny.'

The Return of Kings blog post states that eating disorders are a 'luxury reserved for only the most privileged 
members of the female race'.

'In
 other words, the presence of one of the classic eating disorders is a 
reliable predictor of various socio-economic, cultural, and personality 
traits in a young woman -- features that, in the end, are desirable to 
today’s American man,' the writer, who says he has dated 'several' girls with an eating disorder, explains in his post.

He states that 'Her obsession over her body will improve her overall looks.' His reasoning? 'A
 girl who spends inordinate mental and physical energy on her looks is 
rarely fat,' and: 'While 
they may have a "distorted body image" on the inside, that usually means
 staying trim and fit on the outside'.

The writer also believes that a women with an eating disorder 'costs less money,' because: 'In most cases, she’ll get a 
small dish–like a side salad'.

Also: 'She’s fragile and vulnerable,' he writes, adding that 'an
 inflated ego and an unearned high self-esteem are among the most 
unattractive traits in a girl'.

'You’ll be dealing with a 
tastefully insecure girl, who’s eager to please, and wants nothing more 
than your approval. She’s quick to apologize for transgressions, and 
will make the extra effort to see you -- instead of flaking on you 
constantly,' he insists, adding: 'A girl with a 
mild-to-moderate eating disorder -- that hasn’t excessively marred her 
appearance -- is today’s best-buy in the West’s rapidly plummeting dating 
market.'

'This piece mocks not only 
those who suffer, but their loved ones who know firsthand how dating a 
girl with an eating disorder really looks'

Temimah Zucker, a graduate student at 
the Wurzweiler School of Social Work who has battled anorexia, said 
promoting the idea that an eating disorder is a luxury is 'not only 
infuriating, but dangerous'.

'An eating 
disorder is a mental illness and one that destroys the lives and 
functioning of those who suffer,' she writes in an opinion piece for the Times of Israel. 'Not only [is it] insulting countless people who are suffering, but [it] is 
stereotyping an illness which brings death to too many people.

'I wish 
that I could take this man to a treatment center and have him hear the 
pain and stories of those who are fighting for recovery. . . I wish I 
could sit this man down and explain why what he’s doing can cause harm 
to countless people who truly desire help,' she writes.

'This piece mocks not only 
those who suffer, but their loved ones who know firsthand how dating a 
girl with an eating disorder really looks.'

Christina Grasso, an activist for Project HEAL, which promotes awareness of
 eating disorders and raises funds to provide treatment for those who suffer, agrees, telling MailOnline: 'I've become incredibly thick-skinned and especially tolerant of ignorance toward eating disorders. But this degree of mockery is unprecedented in my experience, and is reprehensible.'

Actress Chloe Grace Moretz also weighed in on the blog post; the writer has been accused of 'dangerously and absurdly' trivializing the disease, which affects 20 million women and 10 million men in the U.S.

Return of Kings, which 'aims to usher the return of the masculine man in a world. . . that allows women to assert superiority and control over men,' has also been accused of trolling in an attempt to attract more readers.

Common headlines on the site include: '20 Things Women Do That Should Be Shamed, Not Celebrated,' and '10 Tell-Tale Signs She’s A Secret Internet Fatty'.

Activist and lawyer 
Brian Cuban, brother of business magnate Mark Cuban, wrote in the 
comments section of the site: 'The post went viral so they got what they 
wanted and made whatever revenue they did off it,' adding that it was 'one of the most 
appalling pieces of crap' he has ever read.

The publisher of Return of Kings, who goes by the name of Roosh and also runs a blog called RooshV which publishes articles titled 'It’s Time To Start Delivering Death Blows To Feminists,' has defended the post.

On Wednesday he wrote that the original article 'contains value for men who want to date 
thin women in America, a country that is currently facing a devastating 
obesity epidemic,' adding that it 'attempts to reduce stigma by encouraging our male readership to give women with anorexia and bulimia an opportunity for real intimacy.'

He added: 'We are educating our masculine readers not to pass on eating disorder victims just because they have an illness, yet instead of receiving thanks, we’re receiving hate instead.'

Roosh, who has refused to take the blog post down or offer an apology, said he has 'come to the conclusion that there is nothing in it that endorses eating disorders or slanders those who have them.

'[The writer] has simply shared knowledge and insights that can aid single men in their pursuit of sexual happiness without hurting women,' he said.

A petition to remove the article has received nearly 11,000 signatures on Change.org at the time of posting.
