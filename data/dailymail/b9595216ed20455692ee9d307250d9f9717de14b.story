Claims: Lloyd Breach, who has been jailed for two years for 13 sexual offences against three girls, was allegedly reported to authorities five years ago

A paedophile could have been stopped five years before he abused three young girls, it has been claimed today.

Lloyd Breach, 21, was jailed for two years after admitting 13 sexual offences against three girls - one aged just 13.

But today a mother claims she reported Breach - who once appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show - to police in 2008, when he was just 16 years old.

She says the man, a former doorman, groomed her two young daughters.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claims she told Sussex Police that Breach had sex with her 15-year-old daughter before making online advances towards her younger sister.

But police allegedly told her it was ‘just what teenagers get up to’ and there was nothing they could do because Breach was 16 - just a year older than her daughter.

The mother said: 'He made contact with my daughter via Facebook and kept messaging her to say he wanted to see her.

'Then in the school summer holidays he came over to my house and told my daughter, who had just turned 15, to have sex with him - it was done in my bed.

'She was under the age of consent so it was statutory rape but nothing was done.

'Breach then tried to speak to my younger daughter last year when she was only 15.'

The woman continued: 'Breach preys on young children, and aged 13 to 15 they are still children because they cannot make those types of decisions.

'He goes for them because he thinks he can control them and make them do what he wants.

'His victims suffer for life and are left traumatised while he gets a lesser sentence.

'Children need to be protected from him to make sure he doesn’t do this again.'

Allegations: The woman says Breach, a former doorman (pictured), slept with her 15-year-old daughter before making advances towards her younger sister

Sussex Police declined to comment about 
the mother’s 2008 statement, because they said that Breach was
 subject to another police inquiry.

Breach admitted two offences of sexual assault, an offence of inciting a girl aged between 13 and 15 to engage in sexual activity, two offences of grooming, one count of attempted grooming and seven charges relating to the possession of indecent images.

Sentenced at Hove Crown Court this month, Breach from Ifield, West Sussex, was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register for ten years.

DC Mark Butcher said: 'This man preyed on young girls who were brave enough to come forward to talk about his actions.

'He groomed two girls and committed further offences against another girl.

'I am pleased he pleaded guilty to these crimes and that he has been punished accordingly.

'I would urge anyone who has been subject of any kind of sexual abuse to report it to police and we will give them all the support they need.'
