In the saddle: Ben Maher is expected to deny all allegations

An Olympic gold medallist showjumper has been accused of pocketing £700,000 in secret payments on horse deals.

Ben Maher was yesterday accused of ripping off his backers over an eight-year partnership.

Mike and Emma Phillips, credited with helping him to victory at the London Games, say they are ‘broken hearted and utterly betrayed’ and are suing him in the High Court.

The stud owners are demanding that the horse he rode to team gold in 2012, Tripple X, be sold, as they claim that they are its co-owners.

According to papers lodged at the High Court, they claim Mr Maher, 30, the world number two in showjumping, owes them nearly £700,000.

Mr and Mrs Phillips, of Quainton Stud in Buckinghamshire, claim he lied about the value of horses that he suggested they buy and sell, pocketing vast sums of ‘secret profit’.

Mrs Phillips, 43, said: ‘We are totally shocked at the abuse of our trust and support. We treated Ben as one of our family, working with him since 2005...

'We did all we could to provide the conditions that led to Ben’s fantastic success at the Olympics last year and now feel broken hearted and utterly betrayed.’

Matthew Collings QC, for the pair, said: ‘Mr and Mrs Phillips acquired, and disposed of, a number of horses on the advice and with the assistance of Mr Maher, including horses for the purpose of helping with Mr Maher’s showjumping career and in particular his preparation for... the London 2012 Olympics.’

Mrs Phillips said she offered to let Mr Maher ride her horses in 2005.

As the couple came to trust him, he acted as their agent in deals to buy and sell horses, including those with which he wanted to compete.

They claim the trouble began in 2006 
when he told them about a ‘promising’ horse, Quirifino, which he was 
‘enthusiastic’ for them to buy.

Mr and Mrs Phillips agreed to pay 140,000 euros (£117,000) and claim Quirifino’s owner then paid at least £8,300 to Mr Maher.

A year later Mr Maher was again ‘enthusiastic’ about a horse called Awanti and the couple agreed to pay 190,000 euros (£160,000) for it, including more than £40,000 in cash, which they claim he kept.

In 2008 – the year Mr Maher rode in his first Olympics in Beijing – they allege he told them a horse called Robin Hood was on sale for £230,000 when its true price was about £70,000.

They say they paid him £115,000 for a half share.

The papers claim the deceptions involved six horses and continued until 2012.

Mr and Mrs Phillips are suing for almost £700,000 plus interest and damages and want the court to look at whether they are owed a share of prize money.

The total could be some £1.5million if their case is successful.

Mr Maher was yesterday competing in the Paris Gucci Masters.

A spokesman said he would not comment until his defence papers had been filed with the High Court.

Horse and Hound magazine reported he was expected to deny the allegations.
