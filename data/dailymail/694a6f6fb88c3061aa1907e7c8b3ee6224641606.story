It's the world’s longest-running soap opera and a national institution.

Yet celebrity fans of The Archers on BBC Radio 4 have said they fear for its future and complain it is changing beyond all recognition.

Former home secretary David Blunkett said the serial, which first aired in 1950, was becoming a ‘disappearing soap’ as characters are killed off and exiled abroad.

Meanwhile broadcasting veteran Dame Jenni Murray said a national scandal would ensue if three major characters leave.

The central couple, David and Ruth Archer, who live and work on Brookfield Farm in Ambridge, look set to move up North with David’s mother Jill, after it was announced a new road could be built through their land.

Writing in the Radio Times, Mr Blunkett, 67, who has listened to the show since he was four, said: ‘I fear that The Archers is on the verge of becoming the disappearing soap. Coronation Street and EastEnders must be rubbing their hands.

‘For as in the Harry Potter books, the cast seem to have an invisibility cloak, and some of them possess the technique of disapparating, which in human speak means magically disappearing.’

Also writing in the magazine, Radio 4 Woman’s Hour presenter Dame Jenni, said: ‘I will kill the editor if he lets David and Ruth and Jill go to Northumberland. Brookfield simply cannot go. It’s just not possible; there will be a national scandal if that happens.’

Mr Blunkett added: ‘I fear for the central family of The Archers. Are David, Ruth and Jill on the edge of being definitively written out?’ Many of The Archers’ five million listeners who tune in every week will share these concerns, following a period of turmoil.

Earlier this month, Tom Graham, who has played Tom Archer for 17 years, announced he was being axed, reportedly to be replaced by another actor.

In the soap, Tom has been living in Canada after jilting his fiancee Kirsty, which prompted her to leave Ambridge too.

And veteran character Nigel Pargetter was controversially killed off in 2011 by falling off a roof.
