A former Apple executive is so frustrated with the selection of apps on the App Store, he has suggested ways in which the firm could do better. 

In an open letter to chief executive Tim Cook, former president of Apple's product division, Jean-Louise Gassée, called the store an ‘impenetrable jungle’.

He criticised the firm for curating apps using algorithms, and instead believes they should be handpicked by a small group of technology writers.

Apps are currently curated using algorithms, although a selection are handpicked each week as part of Editor's Picks.

To be accepted onto the App Store, apps must be functional in that they must not crash, include hidden features or work in a way other than what the developer advertised.

They must also have a user function and developers can't charge for app that doesn't do anything. 

Apps that present excessively objectionable or crude content will be rejected along with apps that are designed to upset or disgust users.

Apps containing pornographic material, defined by Webster’s Dictionary as 'explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings', will be rejected.

As of June 2014, there have been 75 billion app downloads since the store launched in 1998. 

Gassée claimed that getting humans to choose which apps make it onto the store will make the site more ‘intelligible’, and make iOS users happier.

He added that he is so convinced his idea will work, he has even offered to make the changes himself, for free.

‘Instead of using algorithms to sort and promote the apps that you permit on your shelves, why not assign a small group of adepts to create and shepherd an App Store Guide, with sections such as Productivity, Photography, Education, and so on,’ wrote Mr Gassée.

‘Within each section, this team of respected critics will review the best-in-class apps.

‘Moreover, they’ll offer seasoned opinions on must-have features, tips and tricks.’

Gassée added that a weekly newsletter could be used to identify new titles, respond to counter-opinions, present a developer profile, footnote any mistakes, and so on.

This is the second time Gassée has offered to redesign the App Store.

During a lobby conversation at the All Things D in 2011, Mr Gassee said he’d be happy to make these changes without payment.

But ‘the ever-hovering Katie Cotton’ was said to have given him ‘the evil eye and that was the end of the exchange.’

Jean-Louis Gassée joined Apple France in 1981 before moving to its Cupertino headquarters in 1985, where he became president of the Apple Products Division.

He is a mathematics and physics graduate from Paris and currently works at the venture capital firm Allegis Capital in Palo Alto, California.

However, he did state that even though he would do his work for free, Apple would still need to pay the writers and for the infrastructure.

'As an independent publication - or, more likely, an app - an App Store Guide isn’t financially viable. 

'We know it’s next to impossible to entice people to pay for information and I have no appetite for becoming a nano-pennies-per-pageview netwalker.

'So, the App Store Guide must be an Apple publication, a part of its ecosystem.' 

‘As Apple has shown time and again, it’s the product that counts, concluded Mr Gassée.

‘If you see the wisdom of a human-curated Apple App Guide, and I hope you do, I will not seek credit.’
