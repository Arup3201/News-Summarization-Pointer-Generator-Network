Blyth Spartans will learn their FA Cup third-round fate on Monday – and manager Tom Wade has every reason to believe that Chelsea lie in wait.

The Spartans boss – whose Northern League side beat League Two Hartlepool 2-1 on Friday night – met an old woman in a car park at the onset of their cup run back in September and she predicted every score until now, as well as their third-round opponents.

‘I tell everybody about this story and nobody believes me,’ said Wade.

Blyth Spartans manager Tom Wade has revealed an old woman has correctly predicted their FA Cup run

Wade said, as well as correctly predicting the results, the woman claimed they will face Chelsea next

‘An old women came up to me in the car park, and she told us the results would be 2-1, 4-3, 4-1, 2-1 and Chelsea. So she’s been right on four results before the games have even been played. I thought I might have dreamt it - I had a couple of beers that night.

‘But I told people before Friday she said it will be 2-1 (against Hartlepool) and then you’ll get Chelsea in the next round. If that happens I’ll pack in gracefully - play the game and then just pack in. That’s as good as it gets. I wish she had given me six numbers between 1 and 49 as well!’

Should Blyth land a home tie with the Premier League leaders in Monday's draw – live on BBC2 from 7pm – then they will host the match at the 4,400-capacity Croft Park.

Chairman Tony Platten said: ‘Unlike a few years ago, you cannot just say, "Okay, we've got a great draw against x, y or z so let's shift it to St James' Park”. ‘You cannot do that. Whoever we draw and it's at home, whether it's Manchester United of Chelsea, the game will definitely be staged at Croft Park, We have the appropriate safety certificate.’
