Down through the generations, there has always been a special place for the gals from one particular family tree.

First there was grandmama, supremely elegant in an off-the-shoulder dress and full-length pearl necklace.

Then came mother, hand in loving hand with the man she was betrothed to marry.

Auntie Georgina would make an appearance a little while afterwards.

A sophisticated 'girl in pearls'...

Miss Eliza Lawson, from Gloucestershire, has continued a long family tradition by being the cover girl of Country Life magazine

... who also likes to kiss the girls and hug her beau, as seen on Facebook

So perhaps there was a certain inevitability that one day, just like her forebears and relatives, 21-year-old Miss Eliza Lawson would also grace the most famous single page in publishing – the frontispiece of Country Life magazine.

How perfect she looks, blue eyes sparkling brightly, furry collar against the autumn chill, sunlight bathing a flawless complexion.

But peek behind the affectionately named ‘Girls in Pearls’ slot of the 115-year-old magazine, and – golly gosh – how times have changed.

For despite the magazine’s boast that
its frontispiece has become ‘a matchless pictorial social history’, an 
equally celebrated social chronicle – Facebook – tells a rather 
different story through Eliza’s own page.

And it’s more than just the pearls that have moved with the times.

It shows her hugging her boyfriend... looking a little perky with a drink or cigarette in her hand... having fun on holiday... and clearly enjoying college life with her companions – both male and female.

In other words, a thoroughly modern portrait of a 21st century gal.

In the current edition of Country Life, Eliza admits to feeling ‘a certain amount of pressure’ to appear as a girl in pearls, albeit only with pearl earrings, but also calls it ‘a real honour’.

Eliza's aunt, Miss Georgina Lee, posed for the magazine in 1998

In 1985 her mother, the Hon Miranda Jane Newall, was pictured beside her fiance Timothy Lawson, later to become Eliza’s father, on their engagement that November.

Thirteen years later her aunt, Georgina Lee, would grace the page too.

But it was Eliza’s grandmother, then Miss Pamela Elizabeth Rowcliffe, who started the tradition in 1956 on her engagement to Captain the Hon Francis Storer Eaton Newall, later Baron Newall, son of the former Marshal of the RAF.

An ex-Tory backbencher and Eton and Sandhurst educated chairman of the Greyhound Racing Board, Lord Newall was the brains behind Tops, the Turfed Out Peers Society, with a vision for a blue-blooded ‘think-tank’ of hereditary peers expelled from the Lords.

Eliza, from Fairford, Gloucestershire, studied for an executive PA diploma at Oxford Media and Business School.

In an article accompanying her Frontispiece debut, the magazine explains: ‘As the status of Country Life woman changed, we began to divulge more about their lives: their ages, schools, universities, engagements and careers...’

Still a little less, perhaps, than Eliza divulges on her publicly accessible Facebook page.

We learn that she is ‘in a relationship’, and can see a picture of the lucky chap, a young beau called Tom. Her ‘likes’ include an Oxford nightclub.

Meanwhile in Country Life, Lady Newall says: ‘It’s really lovely that generations of the same family, years apart, can appear on the same page, marking similar stages in their lives.’

Quite so. If only they’d had Facebook in Granny’s day.
