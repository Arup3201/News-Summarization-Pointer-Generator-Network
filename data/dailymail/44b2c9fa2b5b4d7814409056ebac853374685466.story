Prime Minister Tony Abbott has dismissed claims of any instability within his government after it emerged MP Warren Entsch  lodged a formal complaint with chief whip Philip Ruddock.

Speaking to 9 News, Tony Abbott said he refused to be drawn into 'insider gossip' regarding his members of cabinet and believes the Australian public have grown tired of government bickering. 

'People are sick of insider gossip and I'm not going to indulge in any' Mr Abbott said. 

‘I'm not going to be distracted by it, I'm just getting on with the job.'

In the candid interview, the Prime Minister also discussed his broken promises, including the controversial decision to cut funding from the ABC.

Mr Abbott explained his decision grew from the Labor Party's 'budget black hole' deficit of $30 billion.   

'When circumstances change, you do have to change your position, so yes, we did break that commitment,' he said. 

Mr Abbott said the ABC had been flying under the budget radar for years and had entirely escaped an efficiency dividend for the past 20 years. 

'We discovered, when we looked at the ABC, that unlike every other media organisation which has had to tighten it’s belt dramatically in the last few years, the ABC was basically getting more money from the government every year,' Mr Abbott said. 

His comments come after MP Warren Entsch hit back at the Prime Minister's claims of sexism within the Liberal party, after Mr Abbott labelled recent criticisms of his chief-of-staff Peta Credlin as motivated by gender.

Along with longstanding Federal MP and former Attorney-General Philip Ruddock, Mr Entsch lodged a formal complaint against Mr Abbott, defending concerns about Ms Credlin's level of power.

 'It's not about her bloody gender for God's sake. Let me tell you, it doesn't matter if her name is    H-A-R-R-Y or  D-I-C-K,' Mr Entsch said. 

'To suggest there's an issue because of gender I find offensive. He (Mr Abbott) has basically said, "If they don't like it they are sexists". If he thinks our legitimate concern...is trivialised to suggest we are sexist is mind-boggling,' he told The Sunday Telegraph. 

Statement: Prime Minister Tony Abbott has the attacks on his chief adviser Peta Credlin are motivated by sexism

'He needs to be very careful because there's a lot of cabinet ministers who have a problem with how the Prime Minister's office is operating. It's as bad as it's ever been,' Mr Entsch said. 

The MP's comments follow Mr Abbott's slap down of members of his own party on Friday amid growing reports of tension between Peta Credlin - his top adviser - and coalition ministers. 

'Do you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was P-E-T-E-R as opposed to P-E-T-A?' Mr Abbott asked. 

'They're like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank': Earlier this week, that is what a Liberal frontbencher reportedly said about Ms Credlin, left, and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop

Mr Abbott said on Friday that if people had a problem with his office they should bring the complaints to him, and was backed by supporters who said that unhappy ministers should confront Ms Credlin, rather than air grievances through the media.

'If they've got any balls, they would go and talk to her herself,' said junior minister Jamie Briggs, calling his colleagues 'gutless', The Age reported. 

Mr Entsch appears to have taken this advice to heart, lodging a formal complaint against the Prime Minister and hitting out at structural issues within the government. 

Ms Credlin's husband currently holds the position of Liberal Federal director, making it difficult to discuss internal problems with either figure, who have held their respective roles for the past two elections.

On Sunday morning, Mr Abbott continued with his Prime Ministerial duties, visiting Queenscliff Surf Life Saving Club on Sydney's north shore

Earlier in the week reports emerged that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop had decided not to take any orders from Ms Credlin.

'They're like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank,' a senior Coalition source told The Australian newspaper on Tuesday.    

Ms Bishop told The Sunday Telegraph that she had a positive relationship with Ms Credlin, declining to comment on Mr Abbott's 'sexism' claims.

Ms Bishop said that she never sought to define issues through the 'prism of gender'.

'Peta Credlin and I have fought battles together and will continue to do so. I have a positive and professional relationship with her,' said Ms Bishop.  

Mr Entsch also criticised the public display of Ms Credlin, who frequently appears in photographs with Mr Abbott, labelling it unusual behaviour.

Mr Abbott's claims of sexism has already set the Twittersphere tittering as the prime minister has long been targeted by critics over his apparent 'women problem.'

Some commentators have alleged that Mr Abbott's comments were made to distract from the decline in popularity of his leadership.

Mr Abbott continued his official duties on Sunday morning, attending the launch of the National Coastal Safety report, despite admitting last week that the government had been performing in a 'ragged' way recently.

The Prime Minister was still convinced of the ability of his office, however, and said that it remained a solid force.

'This is the same office which ran a very effective opposition, it's the same office which has got an enormous amount done this year sometimes under very difficult circumstances,' he said. 

Mr Abbott is no stranger to accusations of sexism, having been famously savaged by then Prime Minister Julia Gillard when he was Opposition Leader. 

'I will not be lectured on sexism or misogny by this man,' Ms Gillard said of Mr Abbott's perceived attitudes to women in a speech that soon went viral.

'I shouldn't have done it, Karl': Mr Abbott later apologised after he winked at a radio presenter when a caller announced she was a sex worker

Mr Abbott's appearance at a 2011 anti-carbon tax rally in front of signs reading 'Ditch the witch' and 'Julia is Bob Brown's b****' was similarly controversial.

And in May, Mr Abbott was forced to apologise after he winked at ABC Radio presenter Jon Faine when a talkback caller announced she was a sex worker.   

Late last week, the Australian Financial Review reported that Ms Bishop 'went bananas' at Mr Abbott when she was not consulted about a plan for a male colleague to 'chaperone' her to a climate change conference in Lima, Peru.

It was claimed Trade Minister Andrew Robb was accompanying Ms Bishop to ensure Australia did not over-commit on his climate change policy promises.  

The bust-ups have overshadowed a significant announcement in Lima by Ms Bishop that Australia will contribute $200 million to a global fund to help poorer nations tackle climate change.
