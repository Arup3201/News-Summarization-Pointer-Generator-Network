Every morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe. 

Spanish newspaper Marca has lauded Real Madrid after their 4-1 thrashing of Almeria on Friday extended their winning run to an astounding 20 games.

The paper labels Carlo Ancelotti's side as 'The Unbeatables' on its front page - but it was not Cristiano Ronaldo who has receiving the plaudits this time - despite scoring two goals.

It was goalkeeper Iker Casillas who Marca believes turned the game in Real's favour. Casillas saved a penalty at 2-1 from Verza, who had already beaten him once in the match.

Marca outlined the pivotal moment of the game by saying 'heaven sent Casillas stops a penalty at 1-2'.

But AS was already turning attention to Real's Club World Cup campaign, which will begin on Tuesday.

AS leads with the headline 'Launched towards the Club World Cup' after thrashing Almeria, alongside Ancelotti's quote that 'only winning the Club World Cup will be good enough.'

Meanwhile in Italy, Corriere dello Sport has the headline 'Operation comeback' as struggling Inter Milan targets the double-signing of striker Ciro Immobile from Borussia Dortmund and winger Alessio Cerci from Atletico Madrid to revive their floundering season.

But Milan are not the only team the paper reports upon with some transfer gossip.

It claims Roma are targeting Bruno Peres of Torino and that Fernando Torres will leave Inter's rivals, AC Milan.
