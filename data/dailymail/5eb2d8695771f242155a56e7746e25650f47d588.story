Four people have been arrested after three wealthy tourists were bludgeoned by a hammer-wielding attacker who sneaked into their hotel room in the middle of the night.

One woman is in a critical condition and the other two remain in hospital although their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

Khuloud Al Muhairi, 36, is still fighting for her life more than 48 hours after being attacked at the hotel, which is off Oxford Street in central London.

She is reported to have been placed in an induced coma.

The 70-year-old father of the three Emirati women was able to speak to his eldest daughter for the first time on Monday evening.

He told The National: 'Khuloud, they told me, had an operation on her nose and jaw,' said Jaffar Nasser Al Najjar. “I could barely hear her. She kept saying, ‘I’m OK, Dad. Don’t worry’.

'My heart is broken to a million pieces and I can’t do anything except to pray that they return safely.'It is understood two other women injured in the same incident in the early hours of Sunday and now recovering at a London hospital are her sisters Fatimah Al Muhairi, 31, and 34-year-old Ohoud Al Muhairi.

All three women, from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), were enjoying a break in London with their children and other relatives.

A fourth woman, who was staying next door and ran down from the seventh floor to the first screaming for help, is believed to be 18-year-old relative Shekha Al Mauhairi.

A lone man managed to get into the room on the seventh floor of the four-star Cumberland Hotel near Marble Arch in London's West End in the early hours of Sunday morning.

When one of the women woke up, he attacked her with the hammer, and then turned on the two other victims, fleeing the hotel in bloodstained clothes.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said three men, aged 56, 34 and 32, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder at addresses in Islington, north London, yesterday. A 31-year-old woman was held on suspicion of handling stolen goods.

All four remain in custody at north London police stations.

The women, who are in their thirties, had travelled to London for a shopping spree from their home in the United Arab Emirates

It is understood that the three women, who are all from the United Arab Emirates, had deliberately left their door unlocked because they were staying in the hotel as part of a large family group.

They were sleeping with three children, who were unharmed, in two adjoining rooms.

The wealthy family, who had come to London for shopping and sightseeing, arrived in the UK between April 3 and 5 and the women had visited large West End stores on Saturday.

No keys were stolen from the hotel and police said there had been no breach of security at the venue. Detectives are scouring CCTV to establish the movements of both the women and their attacker earlier in the day.

The Cumberland Hotel is near Europe's busiest shopping street, Oxford Street, and has 1,000 rooms including a Jimi Hendrix suite.
