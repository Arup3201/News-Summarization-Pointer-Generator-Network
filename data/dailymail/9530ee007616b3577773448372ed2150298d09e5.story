A scientist at Nasa has converted data from the sun into sounds in a process called ‘sonification’.

In a video they use data from Nasa’s Wind spacecraft to 'listen' to the solar magnetic field.

As the solar wind changes in intensity, a shockwave can be heard passing over the spacecraft.

A scientist at the University of Michigan has carried out 'sonification'. This involved turning spacecraft data into audible sounds (illustration shown). This resulted in short clips that revealed shock waves passing over the satellite. The data was gathered by Nasa's Wind satellite in 2007 

Robert Alexander, a PhD candidate in design science at the University of Michigan, performed the process.

He is also a sonification specialist who trains heliophysicists at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

‘Sonification offers a promising supplement to standard visual analysis techniques,’ he said.

The Wind satellite, which is in orbit around the sun, records electromagnetic fluctuations that can be converted directly to audio samples.

Alexander and his team used custom written computer algorithms to convert those electromagnetic frequencies into sounds.

The result is that when a fast stream of plasma - super hot, charged gas that fills space - passes the spacecraft, it creates a noticeable effect.

Converting data from the Wind spacecraft into audio reveals an audible shock wave.

The Wind satellite (right), which launched in 1994 and is still active today, is used to study radio and plasma that occur in the solar wind from the sun (left) before it reaches Earth. The Wind spacecraft has enough fuel to last in solar orbit for 60 years, during which time it could continue to gather useful data

In one example, Alexander's team analysed data points from the Wind satellite from November 2007, condensing three hours of real-time recording to a three second audio clip.

While this 'sonification' process related to an event in 2007, a powerful solar flare blasting its way towards Earth could wreak havoc with communications and power systems in the coming days.

Scientists have warned that the 'extreme' solar storm could affect power grids, satellites and radio transmissions when the flare arrives at the Earth's surface.

But they said they are not 'scared of this one', as the worst of its power looks like it will miss the planet and not cause many problems.

It should, however, lead to stunning auroras extending out from Earth's poles. 

To an untrained ear, the data sounds like a microphone recording on a windy day.

When Alexander presented these sounds to a researcher, however, they could identify a distinct chirping at the beginning of the audio clip followed by a percussive event, culminating in a loud boom.

Alexander translates the data into audio files through a process known as audification, a specific type of sonification that involves directly listening to raw, unedited satellite data.

Translating this data into audio can be likened to part of the process of collecting sound from a person singing into a microphone at a recording studio with reel-to-reel tape. 

When a person sings into a microphone, it detects changes in pressure and converts the pressure signals to changes in magnetic intensity in the form of an electrical signal.

The clips have three distinct sections, including a warble noise leading up to a short knock at slightly higher frequency followed by a quieter segment containing broadband noise that is both rising and hissing. The sound of a shock passing over the spacecraft can also be heard

The electrical signals are stored on the reel tape. Magnetometers on the Wind satellite measure changes in magnetic field directly creating a similar kind of electrical signal. 

Alexander writes a computer program to translate this data to an audio file.

'The tones come out of the data naturally,' he said. 

'If there is a frequency embedded in the data, then that frequency becomes audible as a sound.' 

Listening to data in this way has been done before. In a study in 1982, researchers used audification to identify micrometeroids, or small ring particles, hitting the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it traversed Saturn's rings.

The impacts were visually obscured in the data but could be easily heard - sounding like intense impulses, almost like a hailstorm.

However, the method is not often used in the science community because it requires a certain level of familiarity with the sounds.

For instance, the listener needs to have an understanding of what typical solar wind turbulence sounds like in order to identify atypical events. 

'It's about using your ear to pick out subtle differences,' Alexander said.
