A Mexican teenager died from drinking highly concentrated liquid meth at a border crossing after he tried to persuade inspectors that it was only 
apple juice, according to an an autopsy report.

Cruz
 Marcelino Velazquez, 16, volunteered to take 'a big sip' of the liquid at the San 
Ysidro port of entry in San Diego on November 18, the report said.

But when he was handcuffed 
and taken to a security office, he began screaming in pain and shouted about 'chemicals' before yelling, 'My heart! My heart!' in 
Spanish.

Velazquez, a high school student from Tijuana, died hours later at a hospital in California from acute methamphetamine 
intoxication.

Killed: Cruz Marcelino Velazquez, 16, died in November after offering to take a 'big sip' of the liquid meth he was carrying in bottles across the Mexican border, in an attempt to prove it was juice

The San Diego County Medical Examiner's report 
gives no indication if inspectors asked him to drink the liquid and 
doesn't say if they had an opportunity to stop him when he volunteered.

Velazquez was walking in a pedestrian lane at the crossing when an inspector became suspicious of the teenager, who was carrying two bottles and acting nervously.

The inspector poured a capful of liquid on a counter because he thought it would 
immediately crystallize if it was methamphetamine, according to the 
autopsy report.

The inspector smelled fruit and returned the boy's two 
bottles after the liquid didn't crystallize.

Inspectors also 
raised questions about whether Velazquez had been working in the U.S., 
which would violate terms of his visitor's visa, and ordered him to a 
separate area, the report said.

After he was asked again about the bottles, he drank the 
liquid, claiming it was juice.

Acevedo was taken to the nearby Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center, where he died that evening.

The liquid in both bottles later tested positive for 
methamphetamine and the capful that the inspector poured on the counter 
eventually crystallized.

The inspector who poured the capful 'was
 educated by his supervisor that this was not a proper or safe test for 
detecting methamphetamine', the report says.

Jackie Wasiluk, a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection, the agency that oversees ports of entry, had no 
immediate comment on the findings

San Ysidro, the nation's 
busiest border crossing, has emerged as a major corridor for smuggling 
meth in the past five years as Mexico's Sinaloa cartel has 
increased its presence in the area.

To avoid detection, crystal 
methamphetamine is dissolved in water and disguised in juice bottles, 
windshield wiper fluid containers and gas tanks. It is later converted 
back to crystals.

Children are caught with it several times a week at San Diego crossings, an 'alarming increase,' Joe
 Garcia, assistant special agent in charge of U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement investigations in San Diego, said last year. They are typically paid $50 to $200 a trip.

Acevedo had no previous criminal record.

‘He
 was an average student, he had no discipline problems, he regularly 
attended class,’ María Guadalupe Estrella, principal at his school, Cobach Siglo 
XXI, told the San Diego Union-Tribune.
