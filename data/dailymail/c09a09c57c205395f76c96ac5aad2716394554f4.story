Marouane Fellaini insists he has nothing to prove after it emerged that Manchester United are ready to cut their losses on the Belgian midfielder.

Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday that new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has instructed executive-vice chairman Edward Woodward to sell Fellaini, with the Dutch manager understood to have told associates that the former Everton players is not of the right calibre for the Old Trafford club.

Nothing to prove: Marouane Fellaini trains with Belgium ahead of their quarter final with Argentina

Fellaini, who disappointed once again during Belgium’s victory over the USA in the first knockout round of the World Cup, insists he has nothing in Brazil despite a traumatic first season at Old Trafford.

The Belgian started just twelve Premier League and failed to score as David Moyes endured a dismal campaign after taking over from Sir Alex Ferguson last summer.

But Fellaini, who Moyes brought to the club in a £27.5million deal from Everton, told Sky Sports News: ‘I don’t have to prove (anything) - I’ve been a professional footballer for eight years.’

United are believed to be prepared to listen to offers in the region of £15m for Fellaini but the Belgian refused to comment when quizzed over his Old Trafford future, simply stating: ‘We will see after the World Cup.’

Fellaini must now attempt to impress potential suitors with improved performances at the World Cup and he will have the perfect chance to do so when Belgian side face Argentina in the quarter-final of the competition on Saturday evening.
