The Japan Meteorological Association (JMA) has become the latest organisation to claim that 2014 was the hottest on record.

They say it was 0.27°C warmer than the average from 1981 to 2010, and 0.63°C warmer than the 20th century average - without the help of an El Niño weather event.

And according to their data, ten of the hottest years on record have come since 1998.

The Japan Meteorological Association has released their data for 2014 (shown). They say it is the hottest year on record - 0.27°C above the average from 1981 to 2010, and 0.63°C above the 20th Century average. The findings are especially notable because there was no El Niño last year

The JMA joins Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) in the US, and the UK Met Office, as one of four major global temperature 'keepers' to reveal 2014 was the hottest ever.

All four make their readings separately to one another - and they have all individually come to the same conclusion that last year was the hottest since records began in the late 19th century.

Experts say the rate at which it is warming is alarmingly quick, and heavily suggests the emission of CO2 by humans is causing manmade global warming.

1. 2014 (+0.27°C)

2. 1998 (+0.22°C)

3 (tie). 2013 , 2010 (+0.20°C)

5. 2005 (+0.17°C)

According to the JMA, the average temperature last year was 0.27°C warmer than the average from 1981 to 2010, and 0.63°C warmer than the 20th Century average.

And it is by far the hottest year in 120 years of keeping records.  

The findings also reveal there has been no warming slowdown in the past decade, despite claims to the contrary by skeptics.

Some believed there was a slowdown because of an abnormally extreme El Niño weather effect in 1998 which was the second hottest year on record.

As seen in the graph above, years after 1998 were seen to be cooler, leading some to suggest climate change had been slowing.

However, this data shows that, although cooler than 1998, the top ten hottest years on record all came in the last 16 years - showing there has been no climate slowdown.

Before 1998, no year came close to approaching these top ten in temperature.

Various organisations are preparing to release data, or have already, which shows that 2014 was the hottest year on record across the globe.

While some places, like the US, may have experienced a variation that caused some places to get very slightly colder, overall the global trend is a worrying increase, far faster than any natural phenomenon could cause.

It heavily suggests humans are driving climate change through the emissions of CO2.

In December the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) released data from the majority of 2014 pointing to a record-setting year.

Data from the UK Met Office agreed with the findings.

Nasa's own data is expected to confirm the findings, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) will also reveal on 16 January that 2014 was the hottest year ever.

Here the variations in temperature around the world for the last year can be seen. Although some regions like the US experienced a cooler year, overall the global temperature was found to be much higher on average than has ever been experienced before

'The warmth in 2014 is also notable for another reason: the absence of El Niño,' reported Nature.

'Although Pacific temperatures were high in 2014, atmospheric conditions did not allow El Niño to form.'

Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, added: 'It is surprising to have record heat in a year without strong El Niño.'

He said it is a reminder that the Earth is heating up quickly.

The findings by the JMA follow a release by the UN's World Meteorological Organisation in December that said 2014 was a record-setting year.

Noaa is set to release its findings on 16 January, which are expected to confirm the findings of the other organisations.

According to the UK Met Office last year was also the warmest in the Central England Temperature series, the longest running temperature record in the world, which stretches back to 1659, recording temperatures in an area of central England.

Noaa will release its data on 16 January, which is expected to agree with that by the JMA that 2014 was the hottest ever. Hear can be seen their provisional data from 2014 up to October, although they said there was no realistic scenario where the temperatures in November and December would not make it the hottest year

It is a clear indicator that Earth is warming unnaturally quick
