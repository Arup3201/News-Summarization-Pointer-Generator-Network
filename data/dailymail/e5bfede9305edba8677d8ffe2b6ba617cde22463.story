Max Dawson, a former Northwestern University professor who taught a class called 'The Tribe Has Spoken: Surviving TV's New Reality' for two years was voted off the hit reality show Survivor after just four episodes

Contestants apparently thought Dawson was 'annoying'. He was seen over-strategizing and spewing knowledge of past seasons throughout his time on the show

But his constant over-strategizing, interpersonal skills and vast knowledge of past seasons seemed to bother his competitors, according to the Chicago Tribune. 

Before the voting ceremony on Wednesday's episode, contestant Will Sims said that the debate as to who would go home was 'really about who is the most annoying', and Dawson was offed. 

When host Jeff Probst announced during the ceremony that it was the time to use a hidden immunity idol, Dawson, who received his Bachelor's degree from Brown University in 1999 and went on to get a PhD from Northwestern in 2008, spoke up.

'Hey Jeff, hold up, bro,' He said as reached behind his back, coming up with nothing. 'I just always wanted to say that.' 

His fellow contestants rolled their eyes at his fan-like comment. 

Dawson, a member of the White Collar Tribe while on the show, said that he found 'the personal dynamics' to be a difficult aspect of playing the show

This season of Survivor contestants were divided into three teams: the Blue Collar Tribe, White Collar Tribe and No Collar Tribe. Though Dawson was only ever a member of the white tribe, there is cross-tribe mingling on the show.  

Dawson, who now lives and works in Los Angeles, told the Tribune before the show aired that he 'had no idea how difficult it would be to actually play'. 

'And that applied to the the basic survival elements - the food, the water, the shelter, the sun - but it really, more than anything for me, to the personal dynamics,' he said.  

After the episode aired on Wednesday, Dawson claimed on Twitter that he didn't know that much Survivor trivia, despite teaching a class on the show for two years.

'Full disclosure: I actually don't know that much Survivor trivia. It's just most that players who call themselves fans are actually casuals,' he wrote.
