Millions of British holidaymakers book trips to sun-drenched foreign destinations but have no idea where they are on the map.

A study of 2,000 people who travelled abroad last year showed 53 per cent of those who went to Cyprus had no idea where it actually was, confusing it with mainland Greece.

Just under half of people who booked a sunny break in Turkey were similarly flummoxed when asked to identify it on the map, with many placing pointing to Ukraine is, despite there being more than 1,200 miles between them.

Ancient: It may be steeped in history, but 29 per cent of those who visited Greece confused it on a map with France. Left, the Acropolis in Athens. Right, the Eiffel Tower

And more than one in ten of those who went to France confused it with Belgium when they tried to point it out.

A
similar number of people who had managed to escape to the sunny climes 
of Italy could not identify it, with some mistaking it for Belarus.

It also emerged one in five would be hard pushed to name the capital city of the country they visited, while 27 per cent would not be able to name any of the neighbouring nations.

The research was conducted by British Airways Holidays.

Spokeswoman Claire Bentley said: 'This research shows people are going to all the effort of booking themselves a lovely holiday abroad, and yet so many have absolutely no idea of where they are actually going.

It is surprising to think that people are prepared to spend their hard earned wages on a holiday, without researching something as important as its location.

'We know that cost and temperature is often the most important factor for adults wanting to book a holiday, but 23 per cent of our respondents admitted they would never think to look at where it is on the map before booking.'

Nearly a quarter of those who travelled to Spain last year confused it with France on a map.

The precise location of Portugal left Brits equally baffled with 31 per cent also pointing out France.

The Netherlands caused concern for 36 per cent of people who confused it with Denmark.

When people were asked where France was, 22 per cent thought it was Germany while 29 per cent thought it was Greece.

Even Ireland leaves Brits bewildered. An incredible 24 per cent who visited their neighbouring country last year were unable to say where it was in Europe, believing they were in Spain instead.

Wrong: The peaceful canals of Amsterdam (left) may be a draw for many, but 36 per cent of respondents mixed it up with Copenhagen. Right, the statue of The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen

People were asked to identify the country they had just visited on a map, but the question threw up some surprising results.

Cyprus: 53 per cent said Greece

Turkey: 49 per cent said Ukraine

The Netherlands: 36 per cent said Denmark

Portugal: 31 per cent said France

Greece: 29 per cent said France

Ireland: 24 per cent said Spain

Spain: 23 per cent said France

Germany: 22 per cent said France

France: 14 per cent said Belgium

Italy: 13 per cent said Belarus

Overall, a third of respondents admitted they found it difficult to pinpoint where they went on holiday.

When booking a holiday, the temperature 
of the country turned out to be the most important factor for 65 per 
cent of people, closely followed by local attractions (61 per cent).

Accommodation proved important for 52 per cent of people, while a further 48 per cent were attracted to a hotel's facilities.

Currency was a concern for 47 per cent of people, while 24 per cent wanted a decent swimming pool, 34 per cent wanted easy access to a beach, and 10 per cent wanted a decent pub.

But four in ten people admitted they often travelled to a holiday destination knowing little about where they are going, having failed to research cultural differences, where it is on the map, what the prices of food or drink are, or even what the local places of interest are.

Seven in ten people realised they should be more knowledgeable about their holiday destinations in the future.
