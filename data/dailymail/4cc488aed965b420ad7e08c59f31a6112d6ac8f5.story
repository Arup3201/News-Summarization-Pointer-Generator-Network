It is one of the most genteel cities in Britain.

But the beautiful city of Bath, famous for its Roman baths, the novelist Jane Austen and its Georgian architecture, has a dirty secret.

Official figures reveal that it is home to the debt capital of Britain.

Bath, famous for its Roman baths and Bath Abbey, above, the novelist Jane Austen and its Georgian architecture, has been revealed as the debt capital of Britain

The analysis of every postcode by the British Bankers’ Association found people living in ‘BA1 9’ have, on average, higher personal loan debt than anybody else in Britain.

Each adult in the area has an average personal loan of £2,311 although, in reality, many will have nothing and others will have much higher debts.

It is only one of three postcodes in Britain where the average personal loan debt, calculated on a ‘per capita’ basis, is above £2,000.

The other two are EC1 V2 in east London, close to the City, and NE66 4 in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Bath’s starring appearance at the top of the league for personal loan debt is unexpected, given its status as one of the prettiest, most exclusive places to live in the south-west.

The area, which includes Lansdown, Kelston and North Stoke, is close to exclusive private schools such as Kingswood and the Royal High School and includes the Bath racecourse.

Bath has been named the debt capital of Britain, with official figures revealing that each adult in the BA1 9 postcode has an average personal loan of £2,311

The average house price in the BA1 9 postcode is nearly £750,000, up nearly six per cent over the last year, according to the property website Zoopla.co.uk.

Many of the properties are big detached houses with large gardens and unspoilt views of the countryside.

Patrick Anketell-Jones, a local Conservative councillor for the area, said: ‘I have had no reports of destitution in the area.

The top 10 postcodes in the UK where personal debt is recorded highest with the average amount of personal debt in that area per adult:

1. Bath, BA1 9 - £2,311

2. London, EC1V 2 - £2,188

3. Newcastle upon Tyne, NE66 4 - £2,065

4. Peterborough, PE7 0 - £1,622

10. Preston, PR7 7 - £1,355

‘I’ve never considered [debt] at problem in the ward.’

In a sign of the wealth in the area - rather than the debt - BA1 9 is close to Beckford’s Tower, an 120-foot Neoclassical structure built in 1827 as a retreat for the writer William Beckford and to house his collection of art and books.

He once said: ‘So I am growing rich, and mean to build towers.’

Danny Sacco, the manager of Lansdown Mazda, a new and second-hand motor dealership, said plenty of local people are buying cars from him.

He sold 72 new cars last month, a record for March, and said the market is ‘buoyant.’ The majority of purchases are made using credit.

Overall, the BBA’s report found the total amount of outstanding personal loan debt in the UK is currently £30billion.

The two regions with the largest amount of personal loan debt, which excludes mortgages, are London, with £4.8billion, and the South, with £4.5billion.

Some postcodes are not included in the research if the population is so low that the publication of the data would compromise somebody’s privacy.

In a sign of the mortgages crippling many families, the total outstanding personal loan debt of £30billion is equal to the total amount of mortgage debt of homeowners in south-west London.

The data is based on data from most banking giants, including Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, RBS Group, Santander UK, Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks as well as the building society, Nationwide.
