David Cameron has blown the row over the next EU Commission chief 'out of all proportion', veteran Tory Cabinet minister Ken Clarke said today.

Mr Clarke said the front runner for the Brussels job, Jean-Claude Juncker, was 'not an arch villain' as had been portrayed. His remarks came after the Prime Minister vowed to fight against Mr Juncker's appointment until the end.

Mr Cameron held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Dutch PM Mark Rutte over the appointment tonight. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Cameron explained that his opposition 'would not change'.

Mrs Merkel agreed to hold a vote on the appointment, which Mr Cameron is expected to lose, at the two-day EU summit starting tomorrow.

Minister Without Portfolio Ken Clarke today dismissed the Prime Minister's fight to stop Jean-Claude Juncker becoming the next EU Commission President

Mr Clarke said he was unsure why Jean-Claude Juncker was attracting such criticism.

The former Chancellor said: 'Jean-Claude Juncker? I’m one of the few people – the Prime Minister’s another – who’s probably ever met Jean-Claude Juncker. He’s not an arch-villain.'

He added: 'No one knows what he’s supposed to have done wrong. The idea he’s an arch-federalist, a sort of public enemy number one which the media have made him in the last few days is slightly exaggerated.'

Mr Clarke said there were better candidates to lead the Commission - the Brussels' civil service which acts as the EU's government.

But he said: 'I don’t think it is the most powerful post in Europe.

'This is another thing – I’m obviously feeling in a slightly laid back mood today – I think this is being put out of all proportion.

'There’s one key principle, which is what the Prime Minister goes on about, which is what the choice of who the president is [should be] made in the first place by the elected heads of the national governments and it’s subject to the views of the European Parliament, they have to approve.

'That is the thing that David has got excited about – I think he’s right.'

Mr Clarke said it was more important for Britain to secure a good job for the British EU commissioner.

'My own personal opinion – this isn’t on behalf of the Government – I think that’s more important than who the president of the Commission is,' he said.

The Prime Minister said he would fight 'until the end' against Mr Juncker's appointment, which is expected to be agreed by other EU leaders on Friday

Veteran Tory minister Ken Clarke said he was one of the few politicians, along with David Cameron, who had met Mr Juncker (right). He said the former Luxembourg premier was not an 'arch villain', but admitted he was not the best man for the job

The damning remarks came after the Business Secretary Vince Cable said Mr Cameron's handling of the row over Mr Juncker had damaged Britain's influence in Brussels.

The Prime Minister has cross-party support for his bid to block Mr Juncker from being appointed president of the European Commission.

Mr Cameron has vowed to fight 'until the end' the appointment of a man seen by the UK as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform.

But on the eve of a summit where he is expected to find himself isolated on the appointment by fellow EU leaders, his approach was criticised by the Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister.

'It hasn't been good for David Cameron,' Mr Cable told BBC Radio 4's Today.

'I think he is right in principle that the appointment of the commission president shouldn't be foisted on heads of government.

'I think he was right to take the position he did but the way it's been done, unfortunately, has not helped Britain punch its weight in Europe.'

Mr Juncker said he was confident of securing the post by the end of this week, 'if common sense prevails'.

In an apparent dig at the Prime Minister's campaign against him, the former Luxembourg premier said he was being forced to wait for a decision because common sense was 'very unequally distributed'.

Mr Cameron believes that the selection of a candidate chosen by the largest party grouping in the European Parliament would breach the principle that candidates for top jobs are nominated by national leaders and not by MEPs.

Having apparently failed to recruit enough fellow leaders to form a blocking minority at this week's European Council summit, speculation is mounting that he might be prepared to deploy an arcane EU procedure nicknamed the 'L-bomb' to stop Juncker's candidacy.

The 'Luxembourg compromise' - created in 1965 to assuage the anger of Charles de Gaulle at France being outvoted by smaller countries - allows an EU member to delay a decision which affects an important national interest until a unanimously acceptable solution can be found.
