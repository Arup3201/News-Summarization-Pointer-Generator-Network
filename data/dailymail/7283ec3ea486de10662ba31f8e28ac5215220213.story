Labour faced fresh claims of union abuse last night as it emerged that ethnic minority candidates have been passed over in favour of trade union-supported white candidates.

The party briefly suspended the selection of candidates for council seats in the south London boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth after claims black and Asian applicants were discriminated against.

Four highly qualified black women filed official complaints against Labour officials after not being selected for the shortlist to represent the party in Lambeth.

In Southwark, where deputy leader Harriet Harman has her parliamentary seat, the former black mayor, who has been deselected, accused Miss Harman of failing to uphold her claims to support equality.

The revelations deepen Labour’s internal crisis after it emerged that members of Len McCluskey’s Unite union conspired to stitch-up Labour’s candidate selection in Falkirk.

One black woman who was not selected as a councillor candidate in Lambeth told the Mail: ‘We attend our local ward meetings all year and see the same faces.

'Then suddenly, when it came to councillor candidate selection, all these new faces turned up. They were voting for the other candidate.

‘One woman had a high-powered job and was a trade union member with lots of political friends. The panel interviewing us were all white and it just seemed a fix. 

‘We complained and had an appeal interview, but it was a sham and predetermined.’

A second rejected black candidate added: ‘I know of seven applicants who were rejected at the first round. They were all black. The only person I know who got through was a white man. He just happens to be backed by Unite.’ 

Lambeth is one of the most ethnically diverse boroughs with 50 per cent of voters coming from a minority. But out of its 40 councillors, only nine of them are black or Asian.

In Southwark, Councillor Althea Smith says she was deselected by her local Labour Party in favour of trade union-backed candidates.

She said: ‘People came from outside the borough who have connections to trade unions and MPs and were selected.

These are the people who want to become career politicians.

‘Harriet Harman wants equality, but she wants her own brand of equality.’ 

The controversy comes as Miss Harman’s son was selected last week to stand for Labour in Lewisham, south-east London.

Joe Dromey, 28, is the son of trade union baron Jack Dromey, who was deputy general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union before becoming Labour treasurer and an MP.

Simon Woolley, director of pressure group Operation Black Vote, said he was concerned at the high number of black candidates being struck off. He said: ‘The affair in Lambeth, in particular, is worse than a shambles. It’s absolutely shocking and shameful.’ 

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Day by day fresh evidence emerges of how an unelected union baron is tightening his stranglehold on the Labour Party.’ 

A Labour spokesman dismissed the complaints, pointing out that losing candidates with a grievance have surfaced around the country since the furore blew up about Falkirk.

However, many of the complaints in south London pre-date the controversy.

The spokesman added: ‘We are satisfied that selections are being carried out properly and any suggestion otherwise is wrong.’
