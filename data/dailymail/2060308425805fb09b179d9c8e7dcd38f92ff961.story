It's only Monday but if you're already feeling stressed out by your daily commute and long working hours, a former top health boss could have the hairy solution - llamas!

Celia Gaze, 42, said a trek with the animals is the perfect way to unwind, which is why she has set up a rural retreat where business men and women can do just that.

She said: 'There is llama trekking because 
llamas help with stress. When I was first told that I thought it was a 
stupid thing to say but it is true. When you are on a llama trek it 
really helps you to switch off and forget about everything but the trek.'

Rural retreat: Celia Gaze quit a stressful job to run the Wellbeing Farm in Bolton where she offers treks with llamas

Unwind: The mother said walking with the animals is a good tonic for stressed out people

Celia runs the Wellbeing Farm 
in Edgworth, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, with her partner Stephen 
Whitehead, a butcher.

As well as llama trekking,  basket weaving courses and country cookery classes are also on offer to help guests forget about their woes.

Celia, mother to five year old Matthew, started the business after she became overwhelmed trying to juggle motherhood with a 70 hour working week as an NHS financial troubleshooter.

She said of the retreat: 'This is a direct response to people putting too much pressure on themselves to succeed in the workplace, and making themselves ill.

Better work-life balance: Celia said she struggled working 11 hours a day and being a mother to Matthew, now age five

'I should know because it happened to me. I was in a demanding job but I was putting myself under a lot of pressure and in the end it all got too much for me.

'I was working 11 hours a day from 7.30am to 6.30pm Monday to Friday but was also taking work home in the evenings and was working at weekends. I couldn't switch off. I also had a baby at home and that also played a part.

'I was overdoing it and it was my own fault. The NHS are actually quite good about making sure that staff have a good work/life balance but I was determined to make my job work and that meant working very hard.'

Celia worked in the NHS for 
her whole career in roles including Head of Service Integration 
at Barnet & Chase Farm Hospitals in north London and as Primary Care
Manager at King's College Hospital in London.

She was appointed 'Turnaround 
Director' for the NHS Bury Primary Care Trust in Greater Manchester in 
2009 to transform the authority's finances when Matthew was just two. 
But after nine months in the role, she found the pressure was too much.

In the summer of 2010 we started to become unwell because she was suffering from so much stress.

'I wasn't sleeping and was waking up in the middle of the night. I was always tearful and agitated,' she recalls.

Her doctor signed her off work, which being a self-confessed workaholic she said she found difficult to take.

However, once her sick leave was over and her health had began to recover, she realised there was 'more to life' than working herself to the bone and resigned from her job.

'It was a very difficult decision but it was for the best,' she said. 'I am glad that I had the opportunity to take a step back 
and realise there's more to life.'

Escape the rat race: The Wellbeing Farm offers corporate away days and lifestyle courses where creative and wholesome activities are undertaken

She then had the idea to set up a 
retreat for executives to escape the rat race after meeting two women 
who ran self-help courses from their homes.

She obtained qualifications in stress
management and occupational stress management and then transformed farm land owned by her partner into the 'Wellbeing Farm' where people can go to de-stress.

Her retreat offers corporate away days and lifestyle courses where creative and 
wholesome activities are undertaken such as interacting with animals and learning to cook.

Celia explained: 'We teach people to cook properly because if you are stressed your diet can really deteriorate and that makes your health even worse.'

She added: 'Stress is a taboo subject, and there is a feeling of weakness attached to it. But I have never been a weak person. Stress can affect anyone and it needs to be tackled.

'My life has gone full circle and I have turned what was a stressful situation into a positive thing.'
