Jon Stewart has left his 'Daily Show' in the capable of hands of John Oliver for the summer, and it seems the eager Brit could not wait to get his bum in the chair as he hijacked last nights show just moments before Stewart signed off.

As Stewart prepared to show his final 'Moment of Zen' before his 12-week summer break, Oliver was seen lurking under his desk, taking measurements and ordering directors to remodel the set in pink.

Surprised Stewart was still around, the two chatted: 'Oh wow, you're still here,' Oliver said. 'Looks like we have us an awkward situation on our hands.'

Signing off: Jon Stewart is taking a three-month break to work on his first feature film

Stewart played his supposed 'Moment of Zen' segment with Oliver interrupting.

'Hahaha! It's my show now! You can't even throw to Zen without me butting in. Hey look! I've got your pens! I'm putting them in my pants,' Oliver said as he shoved a dozen pens down his trousers.

Stewart had promised viewers that Oliver would be a more than capable replacement.

'This show will be much classier while he is hosting. You have my word that on my return, it will instantly drop back to the level you have long expected of it,' said Stewart, who also said he was taking a break to undergo a 'massive plastic surgery makeover.'

Eager: John Oliver will be hosting the show for eight weeks until Stewart returns in September

Jon Stewart is taking a break to direct his first feature film, Rosewater, about Maziar Bahari, an Iranian journalist who was locked up after speaking with 'Daily Show' correspondent Jason Jones.

The film is Stewart's adaptation of BBC journalist Maziar Bahari's New York Times best-selling memoir 'Then They Came for Me: A Family’s Story of Love, Captivity and Survival'.

The British-born, Cambridge-educated Oliver has been a Daily Show regular since 2006 and will host the show for eight weeks starting on Monday.

With an average of 2.5 million viewers a night, it's the top-rated late-night show among viewers under 50 and has racked up an unprecedented 10 straight Emmys for a variety series.

For the time being, though, Oliver is focused on humorously lowering everyone's expectations.

'The goal is just don't have this building on fire when he returns, like one of those high-school-party-gone-wrong movies. You know, the parents are out of town and then they come home and it's just the smoking remains of what used to be their home,' he joked to the LA Times. 'That's the worst-case scenario.'

'I'll say 'yes' to anything he wants me to do,' Oliver explained at the 'Daily Show' offices in midtown Manhattan. 'I owe him so much — he brought me over here (to the U.S.) seven years ago — so I'll do anything he wants, whether it's hosting his show or operating as a drug mule between here and Bogota.'

'As it happens,' adds Oliver, looking relieved, 'what he wanted was just hosting this show.'

...and shoves them down his pants!

Oliver, 36, says his comic style was forged by early exposure to Monty Python and Scot Armando Iannucci who produced radio comedies, the British political TV satire 'The Thick of It' and, currently, HBO's 'Veep'. He will be a 'Daily Show' guest next week.

Rory Albanese, the shows producer, says Oliver was the obvious choice for Stewart's replacement citing Oliver's strengths as a writer, producer and on-camera performer.

'I wouldn't be too worried that the show won't be as funny,' Albanese says. 'It's just going to be in proper English.'

Stewart is expected back in the anchor chair the day after Labor Day on September 3rd.

Oliver's first guest on Monday is Seth Rogen, followed by Armando Iannucci, Mavis Staples and Fareed Zakaria.
