Disappearance: Madeleine was nearly four years old when she vanished from Praia da Luz. Police are now investigating whether burglars were involved

British police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have been handed a confidential dossier on burglars in the Algarve by Portuguese officers.

They kept the secret file because of a rash of burglaries in and near Praia da Luz, the resort where Madeleine went missing in May 2007 when she was three.

Some children were abused during the burglaries.

A businesswoman who works in nearby Lagos said the file mainly contains information on Portuguese and Romanian gypsies who break in in the middle of the night.

'It's been going on for years, well before Madeleine disappeared, she told the Sunday Express.

'Police here are aware of the problem but the public aren't aware.'

Another mother claims kidnappers tried to abduct her baby girl after spiking her drink and trying to snatch the child while she was staying at Montechoro, 30 miles away from Luz.

She said: 'It was terrifying, like something out of a film.'

Britain's most senior police officer has suggested his officers are closing in on the people who abducted Madeleine McCann.

Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted his officers have the names of suspects and that ‘some progress’ is being made in the inquiry.

But he declined to be drawn on when the suspects would be quizzed over her disappearance in Portugal seven years ago.

He told BBC’s Radio 5 Live: ‘We have sent three letters of request for international assistance to the Portuguese judiciary, because that is the way their system works.

‘We have got lines of inquiry which are different to the Portuguese Police’s and we are working with them to try to resolve that.

'We are making some progress.’

Asked by presenter Nicky Campbell whether his officers had the names of suspects, he replied: ‘That is correct’.

He declined to comment further.

Analysis of mobile phone data suggested a burglary gang was operating very near to where she vanished as her parents Kate and Gerry dined nearby.
