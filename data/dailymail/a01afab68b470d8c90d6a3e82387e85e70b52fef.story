A co-pilot made a miraculous escape from a plane crash in Iceland that killed the other two occupants – and footage of the incident has been released for the first time.

The shocking footage shows the aircraft – a Beechcraft Super King air ambulance – banking hard and at speed, with no landing gear visible, above a runway in Akureyri.

It quickly loses altitude as it passes the camera – fixed inside a vehicle on the start-line of the drag track – and slams into the ground, creating a gigantic fireball.

Witnesses on the ground are momentarily frozen with shock, before they run towards the billowing smoke.

According to Icelandic news source Visir.is, the captain and ambulance man, Peter Robert Tryggvason, both died – but the co-pilot, Axel Albert Jensen, survived.

Incredibly, it is the second time the co-pilot has survived an accident. According to the user who uploaded the clip: 'Exactly 12 years prior he had an emergency landing.'

The exact causes of the crash, which happened on August 5, 2013, have yet to be found, but there is some speculation that it was a fly-by that went tragically wrong. Other theories suggest the pilot was trying to make an emergency landing at the drag strip because he could not make it to the nearby airport.
