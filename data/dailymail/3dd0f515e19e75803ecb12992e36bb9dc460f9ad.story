A 92-year-old grandmother with dementia had three precious rings pulled from her fingers in a 'deplorable' theft at a care home.

Vulnerable Ruth Rose was robbed of her diamond engagement ring and two other family heirlooms at the private home where she lives.

Her husband, Louis, 90, discovered the shocking theft when he arrived to visit her at Heathlands Village in Prestwich, Greater Manchester.

Victim: Ruth and Louis Rose, a retired jeweller who used to run a shop in Manchester city centre, together

Mrs Rose's family say they are very happy with the day-to-day care at Heathlands which has been 'undermined by a morally bankrupt individual'.

They have made a desperate appeal to find the culprit.

The stolen jewellery included the one-of-a-kind diamond engagement ring Mr Rose gave his wife when he proposed almost 70 years ago.

A diamond eternity ring and a half-hoop opal ring - which had belonged to Mrs Rose's mother - were also stolen. Police are investigating.

Mr Rose, from Prestwich, said: 'When the theft occurred we're not certain. I went last Saturday and noticed that on one of her hands there were no rings.'

Grandfather-of-three Mr Rose, a retired jeweller who used to run a shop in Manchester city centre, checked under his wife's blanket and on her other hand but could not find them. The care home and police were then alerted of the theft.

Mr Rose said: 'I am 100 per cent certain they were pulled from her fingers as she never took them off.'

Mr Rose added: 'I am 100 per cent certain they were pulled from her fingers as she never took them off. There are three rings and although the monetary value is considerable, what upsets me more than anything is that she was assaulted by having the rings taken from her hand. I always hoped that they would go to my three granddaughters. I'm doing my best to come to terms with it.'

Police and care home bosses slammed the theft.

Sergeant Trevor Reid, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Whoever is responsible has physically removed the rings from her fingers and we are working closely with managers and staff to identify the person responsible for this audacious and deplorable crime.'

Karen Phillips, chief executive of the Jewish social care charity The Fed, which runs Heathlands, said: 'We're working very closely with police with regards to an alleged theft of jewellery at Heathlands Village care home. Such a breach of trust is absolutely unforgivable and we utterly condemn this deplorable act.

'The well-being of our residents remains our top priority, and we operate a policy of zero tolerance in relation to such issues. Any breach of trust will result in instant dismissal, and we will take measures to ensure that the guilty party will be prevented from working within the care sector again.

'These kinds of incidents are extremely rare at Heathlands Village but no less devastating for the people affected when they do occur.

'We employ around 400 staff, all of whom undergo thorough CRB checks and rigorous screening methods. We have full compliance with the Care Quality Commission and Bury has assessed our care as "excellent".

'Unfortunately, an isolated act such as this overshadows the level of care that we strive so hard to provide at Heathlands Village.'

Mrs Rose's daughter-in-law, Fran Rose, said: 'The care home have been absolutely fantastic. Ruth is a really positive lady and she's certainly one of the easier ladies to look after.

'She's quiet and very, very gentle. I was with Lou that evening when the theft was discovered and the staff were devastated.

'We are delighted with the care she has been receiving at Heathlands and have no complaints about that whatsoever. It is just a shame that the good work of the nursing home can be undermined by the work of an individual who is morally bankrupt.'
