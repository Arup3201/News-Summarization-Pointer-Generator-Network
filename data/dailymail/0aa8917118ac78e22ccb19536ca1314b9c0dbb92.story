Criticism: The three men who steered HBoS to the brink of collapse today face calls for a lifetime ban on working in the City

The three men who steered HBoS to the brink of collapse today face calls for a lifetime ban on working in the City after their ‘catastrophic failures’ saddled taxpayers with a £28billion bill.

More than four years since the lender had to be rescued by Lloyds and a massive government bailout, the ‘reckless’ bankers at the top have been slated in an official report into the debacle.

But as the  blame game escalated today, former Labour treasury minister Lord Myners took aim at Gordon Brown, claiming the former PM who gave him a job in government 'got it wrong' on opposing tougher rules in the City.

The Government’s Commission on Banking Standards examined the roles played by former HBoS chairman Lord Stevenson and former chief executives Sir James Crosby and Andy Hornby, and its damning report today accuses them of presiding over a lending spree which led to the bank’s downfall at the height of the financial crisis in 2008.

Like Northern Rock, HBoS – created in 2001 by a merger of Halifax and Bank of Scotland – fell to the brink of collapse after relying on risky short-term loans from other banks to fuel its own lending to customers.

When banks became too scared to lend to each other during the financial crisis in 2008, HBoS – saddled with £238billion of debt – had to be rescued by Lloyds.

All three men at the top of the company have moved on to lucrative positions since leaving HBoS, but the commission found their actions so ‘deluded’ it has called on the City watchdog to consider banning them from working in the financial sector ever again.

It also singled out former chairman Lord Stevenson as being ‘incapable of facing up to the reality of what placed the bank in jeopardy’.

In its devastating report, the Commission says:

Last night critics also called for Lord Stevenson and Sir James Crosby to be stripped of their honours, after former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Fred Goodwin was relieved of his knighthood last year.

Paul Moore, the former head of risk at HBoS who was sacked in 2004 shortly after he raised the alarm on its reckless lending, said: ‘These former bosses have been proved to be incompetent and willfully reckless, maybe even dishonest. 

'They need to be stripped of their knighthoods and peerages.’

He
added: ‘We’ve got here very rich people with great power who have not 
been held to account – finally someone from the establishment has taken 
off their gloves and is telling it how it is.’

The City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, is also slammed by the Commission for ‘box ticking’ and failing to prevent the collapse of HBoS, despite warning the lender’s board in 2004 that it was ‘an accident waiting to happen’.

It says: ‘The FSA was ‘not so much the dog that didn’t bark as the dog barking up the wrong tree.’

Lord Myners, a former NatWest executive brought appointed City Minister by Mr Brown in 2008, praised the 'brilliant' and 'forensic' report but said politicians made a mistake in opposing stricter regulation of the industry.

Lord Myners said: 'I wasn't in the government at the time, but I probably was part of a consensus that missed what was happening.

'Gordon Brown was wrong in what he said; his judgement has proven to be wrong, and I’ll put my hand up and say that I was with the consensus in thinking that the City was doing probably quite a good job,' he told BBC Radio 5Live.

'I had been on the court of the Bank of England at that time and had been urging the Governor to look at the issues of risk and poor risk management. But I think Gordon Brown got it wrong.'

Shareholders, including pension savers, have seen their investments wiped out, while more than 35,000 staff at Lloyds and HBoS have lost their jobs since the bailout in 2008.

Andrew Tyrie MP, chairman of the Commission, describes ‘the history of HBoS as a manual of bad banking’.

He added: ‘Consumers and the wider economy, as well as shareholders and taxpayers, have paid a heavy price for the blunders of the HBoS board.’

In its 90-page report, the commission catalogues the ‘toxic’ and ‘incompetent’ decisions made by the management at HBoS.

The report added: ‘We are shocked and surprised that even after the ship has run aground, so many of those who were on the bridge still seem so keen to congratulate themselves on their navigational skills.’ 

The Commission criticises the regulator for only punishing former director Peter Cummings.

Known as the banker to the stars, Cummings headed the corporate division which dished out huge loans. He was fined £500,000 last year and received a lifetime ban from working in the City.

The FSA has this week been replaced by two new watchdogs, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority.

A spokesman said: ‘The Government has done away with the discredited system that failed to sound the alarm as the financial system went wrong, and put in its place a new system that puts the Bank of England back in charge.’

Lord Stevenson

Former HBoS chairman Lord Stevenson is accused by the Banking Commission of being ‘delusional’ and ‘incapable of facing the realities of what placed the bank in jeopardy’.

A series of telling exchanges between the 67-year-old peer – who is a friend of Lord Mandelson – and the City watchdog shortly after the run on Northern Rock in September 2007, are highlighted in the Commission’s report.

When asked how HBoS was coping with the crisis on November 13, 2007, Stevenson insisted that the management team had scaled-back its high-risk behaviour.

‘Without wishing to sound hubristic, management has done a superb job-a-job (sic) that started five years ago…’, he said.

Stevenson also accuses the Financial Services Authority of being ‘paranoid’ about the health of HBoS, adding on March 17, 2008, just months before the lender’s collapse: ‘My soberly considered view is that given the extraordinary external environment, HBoS in an admittedly uncertain and worrying world is in as secure a position as it could be.’

The Cambridge-educated peer, who once described himself as ‘an unreconstructed 1960s Guardian-reading liberal’ and an ‘intellectual snob’, received £815,000 in annual pay and perks at HBoS.

But despite this, in December he stunned the Commission by claiming he only worked there part time and was not responsible for its risky lending. Commission member and former chancellor Lord Lawson accused him of ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’.

Despite Stevenson’s attempts to portray himself as a fringe player in the downfall of HBoS, the Commission points out he was at the helm from ‘its birth to its death.’

The keen violinist became chairman of Halifax in 1999 and assumed the top role two years later when it merged with Bank of Scotland.  

Since leaving HBoS after it was rescued by Lloyds, Stevenson has worked for a private equity firm and he recently quit as a non-executive directorship of a venture capital firm based in tax haven Guernsey.
