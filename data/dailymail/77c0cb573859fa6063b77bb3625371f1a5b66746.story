The baseball off-season is in full swing, and it seems like former Washington Nationals first baseman and current free agent Adam LaRoche has found just the hobby to occupy his time - hunting.

And unlike his team's bid to make the World Series this year, LaRoche seems to actually be pretty good at hunting, successfully bagging himself a Rocky Mountain Elk, something he decided to share with all his fans by posting a photo of his kill to his Twitter.

Not so stoked however, was LaRoche's former Nationals teammate, and current Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher, Dan Haren.

Big catch: Baseball player Adam LaRoche posted a photo to his twitter account after killing a large elk (above) on Wednesday

Not cool man: Soon after, LaRoche's former teammate Dan Haren (above) took to Twitter to sham him

Funny stuff: Haren's tweet (above) seems to be in jest, quoting the classic 90s film My Cousin Vinny

Haren responded to LaRoche's tweet on his own Twitter, writing, 'poor elk, just minding his own business eating some leaves and boom, dead. At least you're having fun.'

The jab seems to be in jest however, as it is a near direct quote from the 1992 film My Cousin Vinny.

In that film, the character player by Marisa Tomei mocks the desire of her lawyer husband, played by Joe Pesci, to go hunting by telling him, 'Imagine you're a deer. You're prancing along, you get thirsty, you spot a little brook, you put your little deer lips down to the cool clear water... BAM! A fu**in bullet rips off part of your head!'

The role would win Tomei an Academy Award. 

BAM: In the film My Cousin Vinny, actress Marissa Tomei (above) plays a woman who tries to dissuade her husband from hunting by saying the same thing Haron did on twitter 

Free agent: LaRoche no doubt needs to unwind after his team had a disappointing post-season, and now being a free agent

As for Haren, he seems to be having a more difficult time relaxing during the off-season, writing last month, 'I miss you Baseball. I also hate you Baseball.'

Maybe Adam can take him hunting.
