Despite losing to New Zealand on Saturday, England coach Stuart Lancaster will have been pleased with a number of indidual displays.

Here, Chris Foy looks into the three close calls that Lancaster will have to make this week.

Ben Morgan vs Billy Vunipola (No 8)

Vunipola has been a rampaging force of nature for Saracens and England all season. He propels his team over the gainline repeatedly, but limped off at Twickenham last weekend and it remains to be seen if he is 100 per cent fit.

Morgan was herculean with his carrying and collision work on Saturday and made a strong case to survive.

Power: Ben Morgan (centre) put in a brilliant performance against New Zealand on Saturday

Kyle Eastmond vs Billy Twelvetrees vs Luther Burrell (Inside centre)

Suddenly, England will have a raft of options. If Twelvetrees is fit, he is the established first choice, but Eastmond was electric, showing pace, footwork and good distribution.

Burrell played at outside centre in the Six Nations but Manu Tuilagi shone there on Saturday, so the Saint will come into this equation.

Marland Yarde vs Chris Ashton (Right wing)

This wasnâ€™t an occasion when Yarde was able to cut loose and show his qualities as an attacking runner and predatory finisher, and his yellow card will count against him.

Ashton enjoyed a prolific, positive end to the domestic season and is surely in the mix, but if he does come in, it could be at the expense of Jonny May.

Up and down: Marland Yarde is a predatory finisher but was shown a yellow card during England's defeat against
