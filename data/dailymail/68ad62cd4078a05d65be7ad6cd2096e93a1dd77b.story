A mother tried frantically to revive her baby boy after finding him lying in blood-stained sheets in his cot at their Australian home, it is claimed.

Casey Veal discovered the bloodied body of 11-month-old Zayden following a robbery at the house in Bendigo, Victoria, on June 15 last year.

Her partner Mathew Tisell was in the bathroom at around 7am when he heard her desperate screams.

Victim: 11-month-old Zayden Veal was found lying in blood-stained sheets in his cot. He died after suffering a heart attack and multiple injuries

'I have never heard her scream like that in my life, it was pure terror', he told police.

'Zayden was black and blue and bloodied up. He was really cold, like a bag of peas.'

Mr Tisell started to perform CPR on Zayden on the living room floor, while Ms Veal called 999, according to 9NEWS.

'I was screaming at her (the operator), 'Someone bashed my son',' said Ms Veal in a statement to police.

She then took over her partner's CPR attempts in a frantic bid to save her baby.

However, paramedics arrived and took Zayden to hospital, where he was declared dead after suffering a heart attack and multiple injuries.

A North Bendigo man, Harley Hicks, has been charged with the murder of baby Zayden on June 15 last year.

The 20-year-old was linked to the death by police because he is wanted for a spate of robberies in the Bendigo area, according to ABC News.

Ms Veal has told a court in Victoria that, on the night of the alleged break-in, she did not think the front door was locked and that the dog she relied on to guard the house had been locked in the laundry room.

She said she had woken up in her house, located in the suburb of Long Gully, to find the front and back doors open and the baby monitor unplugged.

However, Mr Tissell told the court that the doors did not lock properly because of the couple's 'lazy landlord'.

Hicks, who lost a bid to suppress his identity after receiving threats in prison, is alleged to have entered the 
house armed with a baton and taken two 
wallets and a pair of sunglasses.

He is facing a committal hearing charged with aggravated burglary, theft and murder.
