Passengers feared for their lives when part of the wing of an airliner they were flying on suddenly fell off mid-flight.

More than 60 people were on board the CityJet flight from London's City Airport to Florence today when the accident happened.

The section of wing was left dangling precariously under the plane as it circled back over the Thames Estuary returned to the airport.

The section of wing was left dangling precariously under the plane as it circled back over the Thames Estuary returned to the airport.

Despite the Avro Rj85's damaged state, the pilot managed to land the aircraft after radio discussions with maintenance experts on the ground.

Daily Telegraph journalist Cole Moreton, who was a passenger on the plane, tweeted: 'Our @cityjet to Florence bang on take off and forced to turn back after part of the wing fell off.'

He later added: 'Back on the ground @cityjet not looking good.'

A spokesman for the airline said: 'The WX 281 flight had just taken off from London City Airport on its way to Florence when the cover of the operating mechanism on the wing became partially detached.

'The crew followed their standard procedures and, after a discussion with CityJet Maintenance Control, decided to return to London City Airport.

'Air Traffic Control were notified and the aircraft returned making a normal approach and landing. Passengers are being re-directed on another aircraft and will depart with a two hour delay.’

A spokesperson for City Airport said:  'CityJet flight WX281 returned to London City Airport due to a mechanical issue.  The aircraft landed safely and all passengers and crew disembarked normally.'
