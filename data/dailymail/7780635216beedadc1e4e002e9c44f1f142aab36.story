A Connecticut mother and daughter have been arrested after their pit bull and her eight starving puppies were discovered in an abandoned home.

An electrician went to the Trumbull house owned by Charlotte Mines, 28 and Deidra Mines, 53, in October 2013 after the electricity had been switched off to find an emaciated dog when he entered.

Animal control were called and they discovered a further eight malnourished puppies in a room with no food or water anywhere near them, while the property was covered in feces.

Police were called and an arrested warrant was issued for the two women, who were living at another property.

The warrant says that the older dog was friendly when found, but emaciated so badly that her ribs and backbone were showing.

'As we were getting her we heard some whimpering and we went into another room and found the eight puppies,' police said.All the dogs were rescued and hospitalized for several days where veterinarians discovered they were hungry they had eaten a necklace, a pushpin, an earring and plastic.

Food: These are the pieces plastic and pins found in the puppies stomachs which they ate because they were so hungry

They have since all been adopted into loving homes.

Charlotte and Deidra Mines were arrested on May 12 and both charged with nine counts of cruelty to animals.

On October 12 police phoned Charlotte to ask about the dogs they had found on her property.

'Oh yeah, they all died, huh?' she asked, according to warrant application. When police informed her that the dogs were alive, but near death, she said the dogs belonged to her mother.

She claimed that they had tried to look after the dogs after the electricity was turned off, but stopped because they didn't have the money.

The mother and daughter will be back in court next month.
