A former recruitment manager who stole from 250 changing room lockers over a 12-year period is back behind bars after being caught in the act again.

Jeanette Fidler, nicknamed The Magpie, has stolen cash, mobile phones and jewellery from members of gyms, health centres and leisure centres across the north-west.

One victim lost her engagement and wedding rings and on other occasions Fidler managed to break into five different lockers in one swoop.

Despite being repeatedly arrested and jailed, Fidler would get out of prison and do the same thing again.

Yesterday she was locked up again after being caught rifling through a woman's handbag at a gym in Saddleworth, Greater Manchester, for bank cards last June. She later used a Visa card she took to order flowers from Interflora.

Judge Bernard Lever told the 41-year-old mother-of-three that he had previously warned her she would go to jail if she was caught stealing again.

'I remember this case and I remember telling 
you that if you breached the order you would be sentenced to custody,' he said. 
'Yet you rifled a locker again as is your regular behaviour. Everybody 
has tried with you.'

Mark Fireman, mitigating, said that Fidler - who gave birth to her third child last July - no longer took drugs.

He said: 'This is a woman who struggled for many years with an 
addiction to class A drugs.

Thief: Jeanette Fidler has clocked up 250 offences since 2000 after becoming hooked on drugs

Target: Fidler was jailed after admitting stealing from a locker at Saddleworth leisure centre

'She
 has become a mother again and she wishes to look after her child. She 
has removed herself from the area where she was committing crime and she
 has moved away from the people she was committing crime with. It is 
worth taking a final chance.'

The call centre worker, from Stalybridge, was given an Asbo in 2012 which banned her from entering gyms and swimming pools for four years.

Her downfall began in 2000 after 
she lost her job and became hooked on drugs while living in 
Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.

To pay off her debts she spent two years preying on sports centre users and taking wallets and keys.

During her crime spree police mugshots emerged of Fidler looking haggard and drawn due to her years of heavy heroin abuse which contrasted with her healthy look when she was not taking the drug.

Thief: Fidler has previously targeted the Village Gym in Hyde, Greater Manchester in 2012, during her 12-year crime spree

Raid: Fidler sneaked into the Waterside Hotel and Leisure Centre in Didsbury, Manchester, in June 2012 and broke into five lockers and took £205

The court heard yesterday that after being released early from prison on
 licence following a previous jail term, she sneaked into the Waterside Hotel and 
Leisure Centre in Didsbury, Manchester, in June 2012 and broke into five lockers and took £205.

Two days later she targeted the changing rooms at the Village Gym in Hyde, stealing four mobile phones worth 
£1,900 plus £285 in cash and a debit card.

When she was given her Asbo in November 2012, she was spared jail because she had managed to kick her heroin addiction.

At the time, Judge Lever told her: 'You have committed more of these 
offences than I've had hot dinners.

'You have been a 
one-person crimewave going round these leisure centres and rifling 
people's property.

'Why on earth should people have to put up with this? My natural inclination would be to jail you for a very long time.'
