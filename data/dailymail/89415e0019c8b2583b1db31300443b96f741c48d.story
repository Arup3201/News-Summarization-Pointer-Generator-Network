Sue Prickett, 78, was out walking her terrier Suki (together above) in Sherborne, Dorset, when the dog ran off and became trapped down a badger sett

A dog which became trapped down a hole for eight hours was eventually saved after 20 volunteers came to its rescue following a desperate appeal on Facebook.

Sue Prickett, 78, was out walking her terrier Suki in Sherborne, Dorset, when the dog ran off and became trapped down a badger sett.

Ms Prickett desperately tried to free Suki, along with the help of passer-by Shaun Summerbell, who came to her aid when he noticed her in a distressed state.

However, their attempts to free the animal with a spade failed, and Mr Summerbell phoned his wife Julie for help.

She quickly posted a message on Facebook asking for people to go and help with the rescue operation.

Within 30 minutes of her status update, about 20 people had turned up at the scene, armed with torches, spades and pick axes. One person even took a powerful light on a tripod.

The volunteers, who included some off-duty firemen, spent about four hours digging a four-foot deep trench to free the frightened pet.

After eventually being released, Suki was handed back to her relieved owner who described the rescue as 'an example of the Great British public really being great.'

She said: 'I have been past the hole before and my little dog has never attempted to go in.

'I don't know why she went down this time but she did.

'She came out backwards and I tried to get hold of her legs but she yelped and went back in further.

'I was just hanging around for about an hour hoping she would come out.

'Suki kept crying and whimpering, she's normally a very quiet dog. It was quite frightening because I felt so helpless.'

Ms Prickett said she had been out walking both Suki, and her friend's labradoodle Rosie, when the incident occurred. After initial attempts to free her dog failed, she returned home to try and call the RSPCA for help, but she said they told her rescuers couldn't help because it was dark.

She added: 'I had to get back because my friend was expecting her dog back and I don't have a mobile phone but I was so worried about leaving her there.

After initial attempts to free Suki by Ms Prickett failed, an army of 20 volunteers arrived at the scene thanks to a Facebook plea from a passer-by's wife. The helpers dug a trench (left) to free Suki (right) from the deep hole

The volunteers, including some off-duty firemen, spent about four hours digging a four-foot deep trench to free the frightened pet. Suki was eventually rescued from the hole and returned, rather muddy, to her owner

Ms Prickett, 78, described the rescue as 'an example of the Great British public really being great' and said one person even came out dressed in a giraffe-print onesie to help with the rescue in Sherborne, Dorset

'When I got home I tried calling people who could help - the vet, some firemen who don't live far from me, and the RSPCA but they said they couldn't come out in the dark.

'I went back to the field and just didn't know what to do. Then this very kind gentleman came past with his dog.

'He called someone and very quickly an enormous amount of people came out of the woodwork. One girl even came out in a giraffe-print onesie.

'Somebody brought a tripod with a light on it and suddenly there were torches, spades and pick axes. Two of the men were off-duty firemen and were very helpful.

'They were digging around where they thought she was and they literally sort of hand-dug her out.

'It was about four foot deep and when she came out her fur was covered in beads of rolled up mud.

'It took me ages to wash it all out and she shook mud all over the bathroom, but I'm so relieved to have her back.

Ms Prickett said it took her ages to get all of the mud off her beloved dog, who was uninjured in the ordeal

The pensioner said: 'Suki is very special to me and I am extremely grateful to all those people who helped'

'I don't have the internet and Twitter and these things are all alien to me but it just goes to show you the power of social media.

'It's an example of the Great British public really being great.

'Suki is very special to me and I am extremely grateful to all those people.'

Mrs Summerbell, a 50-year-old school dinner lady, said she put out a plea for volunteers on Facebook after her husband - a managing director of a company which designs and produces baby products – phoned for help.

She said: 'My husband rang me and asked me to bring him a spade to the field which is about a mile away.

'After an hour he called again and said could I try to get some muscle power up there because he couldn't do it on his own.

'I didn't know what to do so I asked people to help on my Facebook status and it worked, within half-an-hour 20 people had turned up there.

'They had to dig a very big hole, it was about four foot down and four foot across.'
