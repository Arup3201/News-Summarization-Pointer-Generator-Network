Wycombe took advantage of Bury's loss at AFC Wimbledon to go top of Sky Bet League Two with a 3-1 success at Morecambe.

Sam Wood, Paul Hayes and Joe Jacobson netted for Wanderers, while their hosts could only respond through Andrew Fleming and had Jamie Devitt dismissed.

Adebayo Akinfenwa bagged a brace and Matt Tubbs was also on target as the Wombles edged out the Shakers 3-2 at Kingsmeadow Stadium, with Danny Mayor's strike and a Ryan Lowe penalty not enough to get Bury back in it.
