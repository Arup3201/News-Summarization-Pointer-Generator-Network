A man walked 45 miles through the Montana wilderness looking for help after being bitten by a rattlesnake – then drove himself to the hospital.

Jason Hauge, of Bozeman, MT., was tubing down a local river Saturday before being bitten by a rattlesnake on the shore. The grocery store manager walked 45 minutes to his car and drove another 30 minutes to the hospital - doctors couldn’t believe his story.

Mr Hauge, 31, told NBC Montana the snake had no rattle to warn him, something he called a ‘freak coincidence.’

Strong willed: Jason Hauge walked almost an hour, only to drive 30 minutes to a local hospital after being bitten by a rattlesnake

‘[The snake] happened to be coming out of the tall grass to sun himself right there on that little island,’ Hauge told the station. ‘I mean, I would have seen him had he been curled up and ready to spring at me – but he wasn't.’

Realizing time was of the essence, Hauge started making his way back to his car, almost an hour away on-foot.

The bite didn’t hurt, but the venom soon started taking its toll.

‘I could see it started bleeding, it felt like someone was shoving a soldering iron into the side of leg,’ Hauge said.

Painful: 'It felt like someone was shoving a hot sodlering iron into my leg,' Hauge said

Explaining to the station that he’s lived in Montana long enough to know the effects of rattlesnakes, Hauge said he kept telling himself ‘okay, I need to get to the hospital.’

The remote wilderness of Montana doesn’t have reliable cell phone coverage, forcing Hauge to walk 45 minutes to his car before driving another half hour to a local hospital, astonishing doctors.

‘They were pretty amazed, I guess, that I had walked and that I was still standing,’ said Hauge.

The anti-venom made Hauge very sick, he told the station.

‘Broke out in hives, puking uncontrollably,’ said Hauge.

Per protocol, doctors monitored him for eight hours, a hospital spokesperson told the station.

Venom is released in about 75% of snake bites, the spokesperson noted. About 20 per cent of the snake's bites are lethal if untreated, according to the University of Adelaide.

Though Hauge won’t stop enjoying the outdoors, he told the station he might not hit the river anytime soon.

‘I don't think I will do much differently. I mean, I love the outdoors in Montana… [but] I'll definitely be a little gun shy about floating the river on a tube for a while.’
