Amateur jockey JT McNamara has returned home to Ireland 15 months after suffering serious injury in a fall at the 2013 Cheltenham Festival.

McNamara was riding Galaxy Rock in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup when he fell at the first fence and was immediately taken to hospital.

He was moved to a specialist treatment ward at Southport but is now considered well enough to return back home.

Recovering: JT McNamara has returned home to Ireland 15 months after suffering serious injury

A statement released by the Irish Turf Club on behalf of McNamara and his wife Caroline said: 'We are delighted to announce the return home of JT McNamara some 15 months after his life-changing injury in a fall at Cheltenham in March 2013.

'JT and Caroline wish to thank the doctors, nurses and all the staff at North West Regional Spinal Injuries Centre in Southport, Merseyside in the UK for their excellent care, support and treatment during JT's time in the hospital.

'We would also like to thank most sincerely the Turf Club, especially Denis Egan and Dr Adrian McGoldrick.

Concern: The amateur jockey fell during the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup in 2013

'Without the help of the Turf Club, Miriam Wiltshire and the staff of the North West Regional Spinal Injuries Centre, it would not have been possible for JT to return home.

'We are truly thankful to all the visitors who came to see JT while in hospital, for all the cards, well wishes and the continued support from everybody.

'It has been so overwhelming and again a sincere thank you to all from the both of us.'
