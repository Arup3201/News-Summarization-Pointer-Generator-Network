Boss: Irfan 'Chubbs' Nasser, pictured by secret services, was too fat to run around with a gun at a terrorist training camp in Pakistan so learned how to make bombs instead

The 'four lions' gang that planned the biggest terrorist atrocity the UK has faced in a generation was led by a 23-stone chemist deemed too fat to be a suicide bomber.

Nicknamed 'Chubbs' and 'Big Irfan' by his fellow plotters, it was Irfan Naseer's 
bulky frame that helped him to work on his bomb-making skills while at training camps in Pakistan.

The 31-year-old was too overweight to go on physical training exercises, and admitted he was mixing chemicals rather than 'running up and down the 
mountains with weapons'.

Naseer gained an A at A Level chemistry, and honed his skills during a 
four year pharmaceuticals course at Aston University in Birmingham, 
coming out with a 2:2 degree in 2003.

He barely worked afterwards and spent his time showing his fellow terrorists how to make a bomb out of sports 
injury treatments.

His fascination for science first began during experiments at school while studying for GCSE chemistry classes, when the teacher showed him how to distil chemicals with a Bunsen burner.

'When I was doing my GCSEs, one of the teachers did an experiment where he had a Bunsen burner and he threw a chemical on to the fire', he told the court.

'It caused a massive flame which blackened the roof, and that kind of got me into it.'

After a raid on the group's headquarters in Birmingham, Naseer had chemistry textbooks left over from his university days on his book shelves in his bedroom, mixed in with a Jihadi flag and terrorist handbooks.

Headquarters: The group's safe house in Birmingham was filled with Big Irfan's chemistry books, mixed with  terrorist handbooks and a computer used to search for the Anarchist's Cookbook

He had also searched repeatedly online for bomb making tips and details of how to concoct homemade explosives.

Among his Internet search history was a website containing the Anarchist's Cookbook.

Big Irfan admitted in court he had spent eight-and-a-half years memorising the Koran, from the age of 19.

He
 wanted to treat himself to a quad bike in the run up to his martyrdom 
and was overheard telling his fellow plotters: 'It's good fun, yeah, but
 I wouldn't do it on the road - that's not befitting, bro. A guy with a 
beard and that sitting on top of that doesn't look good.'

Jihadist: Irfan Khalid was bent on killing himself and many others in a terror attack on Britain but refused to give evidence in court so his motives are unclear

His blood-thirsty lieutenant was Irfan Khalid, 27, who has steadfastly refused to reveal anything about his terrorist activities or intentions, and did not give evidence in court.

Dubbed 'Little Irfan' to distinguish him from the heftier Naseer, he had previously worked as a security guard in March 2010.

Khalid, also nicknamed Sylvester, is only recorded as completing two shifts, and this was his only known job.

Khalid joined Naseer on their two journeys to Pakistan, recording suicide videos while they were out there and boasting about the contents on their return.

He was recorded by police chillingly predicting he would be dead by June 2011, but how he was propelled to this deadly aim remains largely a mystery.

Born March 1, 1985, he was born and raised in Birmingham in the same Muslim-dominated community as his fellow plotters.

Records show he was an erstwhile student at Solihull College between 2001 and 2003, and emerged with a handful of qualifications. 

He achieved a Level One key skills qualification in information technology during his time at the college, as well as completing a course in Access to Further Education Services. 

But this did not lead to a full time job, and there are no records of Khalid paying tax in the intervening period. 

Khalid, like Ali, also suffered from vision problems and needed contacts lenses after suffering a head injury at some point in his past.

Ashik Ali, 27, who joked that the band of terrorists were like the cell depicted in Chris Morris comedy film 'Four Lions', and aped the main character by distancing himself from his wife to protect her

Finally there was Ashik Ali, 27,  who joked that the band of terrorists were like the cell depicted in Chris Morris comedy film 'Four Lions', and aped the main character by distancing himself from his wife to protect her.

Prosecutors showed he was secretly recorded telling Salma Kabal that he was planning to head abroad for Jihad, and later confessed the split from his wife was to insulate her from the terrorist intentions.

He referenced Four Lions directly in the calls, and prosecutors argued successfully that although he was half-joking, Ali was taking his role as a terrorist very seriously.

Ali's own defence offered up another alternative explanation, however. That Ali was propelled towards suicide martyrdom because of despair at the break-up of his marriage.

He told the court he split from Kabal in the summer of 2010 after she moved in with her parents while they looked for somewhere to live together.

The newly-married couple slept on a mattress in the living room in cramped conditions for a while before she finally put an end to the relationship. 

Texts from Ali show him begging for a second chance to make the marriage work, but he was apparently spurned time and time again. 

In one telling message. he claimed that he knew what it would be like to kill others because his own life had been shattered by their divorce. 

He wrote: 'I would know how it feels because you destroyed mine, when I begged you that night not to leave me but you did.

'That was the day when both of our lives were destroyed.'

Ali is severely visually impaired and was forced to read documents in court on a large screen.

His vision is so bad that he struggles to make out the facial expressions of people he is talking to and requires large print to read anything.

He also suffers hearing difficulties because of a botched attempt to syringe wax out of his own ears.When
 detectives raided his home, they found he had downloaded nearly 150 
Islamic lectures from the Internet, including extremist rants, and 
passed them on to Irfan Naseer. 

Among
 the hoard of videos were lectures by radical preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, 
an Al Qaeda cleric killed by a US drone attack in Yemen in 2010 just 12 
days after the trio were arrested.

Ali
 converted his home in White Street, Birmingham into a fledgling bomb 
factory, where chemicals could be distilled by the terrorist crew. 

He had only recently moved to the address after the breakdown of his marriage to Kabal.

Ali's
 defence barristers tried to paint him as merely a 'chai wallah' who 
provided refreshments to his friends but was only joking when taped 
discussing suicide bombing plans.

But Ali was also the one who scouted out a possible loan from Barclays Bank to set up the Dawah shop cover. 

His CV contained a tissue of lies, included inflated exam grades and claims he was a gym instructor when in fact he worked as a receptionist. 

He claimed to have GCSE C or D grades for subjects such as English, Maths and Science, when in reality, he had achieved no higher than an E.

His CV also falsely stated that he had been regional manager for the Ummah Welfare Trust charity, when he had just been a collector. 

Prior to his arrest, Ali was running a legitimate business repairing bicycles for £25 a time, but his disabilities meant he sometimes took two days on just one repair and it was not a business he could live off.
