Collins is being held at the  North Richland Hills Jail on $1million bail after being caught by police at his father's home in Tarrant County.

Police charged Wright with his mother's murder and said that there were no other suspects.

A medical examiner said that 45-year-old Ms Lozano's cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.

Sgt Ed Wright told the Star-Telegram: 'We’re not releasing what weapon was used or if he used his hands.'

Police refused to reveal if the suspect was intoxicated or under the influence of drugs at the time of the killing. Authorities also did not say if they had previously visited the home in connection with other disturbances.

Ms Lozano had worked for the city's utilities department for 11 years where colleagues described her as having a 'smile and a helpful attitude'.
