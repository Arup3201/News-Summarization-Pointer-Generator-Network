A pair of university sweethearts who had just moved into their dream new home in 'America's Safest City' were discovered shot dead in the property's private car park last night.

A passerby discovered the bodies of Keith Lawrence, 27, and his fiancée, 28-year-old Monica Quan, whose father is a former LAPD captain, around 9pm last night, the Orange County Register reports.

The young couple were slumped over in their white Kia in the apartment's car park in Irvine - the city which was named the country's safest last year by the FBI.

It is the eighth year straight that the Orange County city has won the accolade for its low crime rate after only reporting 120 violent crimes for 2011-12.

Police say the couple had only just moved in to the property on Scholarship.

Investigators say they have no idea what the motive could be for the double homicide.

The couple, who met while undergraduate students at Concordia University, did not appear to have been mugged and officers said it was not a case of murder-suicide.

Lt. Julia Engen of the Irvine Police Department said: 'It doesn't appear they were robbed. There's no obvious motive.'

The pair met while they were both on the university's basketball teams. They moved in with each other at the exclusive condo complex, where apartments reportedly sell for up to £1million.

Quan, a masters student, continued her love of basketball beyond university, working as an assistant coach for the women's basketball team at Cal State Fullerton.

She attended local Walnut High School, where she set a record for the most three-pointers during a season and a game.

Her father Randal Quan, was the first Chinese-American captain in the Los Angeles Police Department according to the Register.

Lawrence, a business graduate, was an armed public-safety officer at USC and had graduated from Ventura County Sheriff’s Academy.

Chief John Thomas said in a statement: “During his brief tenure of service here at USC, Officer Lawrence proved to be an honorable, compassionate and professional member of our department.'

'We are a better department and the USC Campus Community is a safer place as a result of his service.'

The president of Cal State Fullerton, Mildred Garcia, expressed her sympathy to the two families today.

'The loss of any member of the Titan family causes our community great grief, but the loss of one of our own under these circumstances is indeed tragic and heartwrenching,' she said.

'We hope that Monica’s family and friends will feel and be comforted by our support during this difficult time'.

Lawrence was found in the car's driver seat and his fiancee was in the passenger side.

Police say they were shot in the stationary vehicle.
