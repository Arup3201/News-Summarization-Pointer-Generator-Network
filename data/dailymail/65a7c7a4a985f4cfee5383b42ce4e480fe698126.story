It is hardly what you expect when splashing out up to £9,000 on first class flights to the Caribbean.

But after treating himself to the 'trip of a lifetime', TV news presenter Owen Thomas was horrified to find dirt and grime caked around his first class seat.

Videoing the evidence, the former BBC anchorman posted the evidence on Twitter, dubbing the the service 'Filth Class'.   

When the footrest that forms part of the seat is pulled down, it reveals an area calked in dirt and grime

Narrating the short 30-second video, the presenter explains: 'So this is BA first class and it is abs filthy. You see the marks on here, most of these you can just actually scrape off.

'You see the stains down here. It's when you open your seat that the real horror begins

'This is first class. This is British Airways First Class. It's disgusting.'

The former BBC anchorman and reporter flew off to St Lucia with a companion on Saturday in First Class seats that retail on BA's website for nearly £9,000 each in peak-season January. 

BA were today advertising seats for this month at £8,798. But he was so disgusted that he posted on Twitter: 'Be shocked. This is what @BritishAirways FIRST CLASS is really like, as we experienced yesterday. Unbelievable.' 

On YouTube, his video was posted under the headline: 'British Airways First Class – Filth Class' he wrote: 'This is what first class in BA is really like. London to St Lucia on 17th January 2015. 

The TV presenter told Mailonline that he and his business executive partner flew out of Gatwick on Saturday morning  for a  luxury 10-day break.

‘My partner, Kai and I took this trip after a stressful couple of years where we’ve both been working in different countries. We’re not part of the jet-set. We saved for this once in a lifetime opportunity and I’m really appalled that BA could treat us, or anybody else, with such contempt.’

He added: ‘This is nothing short of corporate greed. They took our money - lots of it - and clearly can’t give a damn about their customers, whether they’re in first or economy.’ 

After being contacted by MailOnline BA apologised for the poor state of the First Class bay and admitted they had 'fallen short of our usual high standards'.

Hinting that part of the fare was paid for in Air Miles points, Mr Thomas said of his travelling companion: 'After two years apart we had points and deserved this as a mega treat. Never again.' 

Owen Thomas posted the footage on YouTube showing how the area around the seat appeared not to have been cleaned

The surfaces next to the window seat appear to have been splashed but not wiped down after, causing stains

Another nearby traveller who posted under @hotelrepublic a photograph of their own grubby First Class seat said: 'I was sitting next to @OwenThomasTV seat 2a and my seat wasn't much cleaner. 

Health hazard. 'The purser agreed that it was 'pretty bad' and asked us to fill in a form.' Alex Deane said simply: 'Yuck.' Sky broadcaster Stephen Dixon joined in the chorus of comment tweeting: 'To be fair, you should just travel standard like the rest of us.' 

TV journalist David Ingles tweeted: 'They would have to pay me to consider getting anywhere near that. 

Rob Russell said :'I really hope the staff did something about that – looks awful. 'I love British Airways but sometimes they really let themselves down.' 

British Airways said: 'We have contacted our customer to apologise. We are very sorry that on this occasion we have fallen short of our usual high standards. 

'We pride ourselves on delivering a relaxing and pleasant experience in First, and are taking immediate action to address this issue.'  

BA also said flights to St Lucia in First Class start from £2,700 return and said the £8,798 price it is currently quoting on its official ba.com website for January was ‘misleading’ because it would only be for ‘someone booking at the last minute’. 

Former BBC journalist Owen Thomas joined financial media firm Bloomberg in 2011 and has become a specialist in economics and business journalism.

His website says his career in news started more than twenty years ago. He began while still a student at Aston University, reporting for the BBC's local radio station.

His first big break came on the third day of a placement at the BBC's Business Unit when he jumped into the presenter's chair after the duty anchor didn't show up.

He travelled the globe as a reporter and presenter on BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat for many years before being lured back into television and London Tonight. 

The news presenter was on board a BA2159 aircraft when he filmed the conditions in the First Class cabin

To paradise, but with a rocky start: The presenter was on his way to the Caribbean island of St Lucia (above) when he noticed the grime on board his five-star flight
