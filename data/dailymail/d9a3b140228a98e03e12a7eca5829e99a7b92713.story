Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough says bringing jailed striker Ched Evans back to Bramall Lane should be a decision taken by the owner and not at football level.

Evans is due to be released two-and-a-half years into a five-year prison sentence for rape on Friday and has been heavily linked with a return to the Blades - the club he was at when convicted in 2012.

The South Yorkshire outfit have faced a backlash over potentially re-signing the former Wales international, with more than 90,000 people signing a petition against his possible re-employment.

But they are continuing to discuss the matter, with Clough only having a small say in the decision.

'We have had one or two discussions, we are awaiting a decision and the owners will make that in good time.' Clough said.

'I have been involved in decisions, but it is very much a decision for the owners and when the time is right to say something as a club we will do that.

'It is that sort of decision - it's above football level.

'It's my decision whether to put him in the team if he comes back, it's not my decision whether he comes back in the first place - that's theirs.

'Until the decision is made there is no point talking about it.

'It's not been distraction within the camp. First of all he's not out yet and secondly the club haven't made a decision and until those two things happen it is irrelevant.'

Evans scored 48 goals in 113 games for the Blades prior to his imprisonment, including 35 in 42 games during the 2011-12 campaign which was cut short due to his trial and conviction.

A jury at Caernarfon Crown Court found Evans guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in April 2012.

Evans admitted having sex with the woman on May 30 2011, but said it was consensual.
