A school bus driver has been arrested for his third DUI after he allegedly drove a vehicle filled with high school students while drunk.

Robert E. Murphy, 59, from Ashland, Massachusetts, was driving the Hopkinton High School cross country team back from a meet on Saturday night when one of the coaches on board called police with concerns that he was intoxicated.

Hopkinton Police Officer Aaron O'Neil met the bus, which was carrying 25 students, as it was turning into the high school parking lot.

Once all the students were let off safely, Officer O'Neil conducted a series of standardized sobriety tests on Murphy, which the driver failed, CBS Boston reported.

Boys Cross Country Coach Jennifer Fairbanks told the news channel that the bus driver was swerving during the journey.

'We were heading home from a race down on Cape Cod and there were a few things that I finally put together,' she said. 'It still makes me nervous.'

Ms Fairbanks said she called police, but she did not want the students of the bus to know anything was wrong.

'I was just dealing directly with police,' she said. 'My biggest concern was just keeping all the kids on the bus safe.'

Murphy was arrested on charges of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and operating a motor vehicle to endanger.

Police said it was Murphy's third DUI offense.

He was taken to the Hopkinton Police Department where bail was arranged and he is scheduled to appear at Framingham District Court later today.
