Couples should not try to emulate the glamorous weddings of the stars if they really want their marriages to last, a High Court judge said last night.

The lavish ceremonies splashed across the pages of celebrity magazines such as Hello! have little to do with the reality of lifelong commitment, according to Sir Paul Coleridge.

They are also twice as likely to end in divorce over ten years, according to research from the Marriage Foundation, the  charity Sir Paul launched  this year. Forty per cent of stars’ marriages end within a decade compared to just 20 per cent of ordinary couples’, the study found.

‘The worrying feature of these 
statistics is the picture they paint to those who regard the celebrity 
lifestyle as something to be admired and copied for its own sake,’ Sir 
Paul said.

‘These are, after all, the role models
upon which many, especially young people, fashion their lives. 
Aspiration for happiness built on celebrity lifestyle is, it seems, 
dangerously flawed.

All of us subconsciously want to believe that these 
beautiful people are living an idealised life which we can vicariously 
enjoy.

‘Surely this must create a false 
expectation within the participants that in some way their relationships
will be better, easier and, above all, more exciting than the average.

A wedding issue of Hello! magazine being read. The report says the celebrity culture absorbed from magazines like Hello! gives us an 'unrealistic, fairy-tale expectations about marriage'

‘Unfortunately all men and women, 
glamorous or not, are riddled with the same weaknesses and shortcomings 
which surface even quite soon after the excitement of the wedding has 
died down.’

Sir Paul, a senior family court judge,
said real life has nothing to do with the stars’ love stories played 
out in celebrity magazines and on TV.

‘There is a disconnect between the 
nature of real long-term relationships and the dramatised and apparently
more exciting versions portrayed on screen or imagined for them by the 
rest of us,’ he said.

Katy Perry and Russell Brand, pictured left in 2010, were married for 14 months and Jennifer Lopez was married to dancer Cris Judd, right for eight months

5 of the shortest celebrity marriages:

Britney Spears and Jason Alexander (55 hours)

Sinead O’Connor and Barry Herridge (18 days)

Drew Barrymore and Jeremy Thomas (30 days)

Pamela Anderson and Rick Salomon (60 days)

Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries (72 days)

5 of the longest–lasting celebrity marriages:

Kirk Douglas and Anne Buydens (58 years)

Barry and Linda Gibb (40 years)

Jeff Bridges and Susan Geston (35 years)

Ringo Starr and Barbara Bach (31 years)

Tony and Cherie Blair (30 years)

‘This is surely exacerbated by huge, expensive 
fairytale weddings attended by the icons of the day.’

The report pointed to the 55-hour 
marriage between Britney Spears and Jason Alexander and said that ‘few 
non-celebs can match that kind of relaxed attitude to their marriage’.

Others whose marriages barely made a year include Russell Brand and Katy
Perry, and Kim Kardashian.

Sir Paul said that while most celebrities hankered for a stable marriage like anyone else, their fame made it harder to find.

‘They pay the price by being even less able to sustain long-term healthy relationships than the rest of us,’ he said.

The 40 per cent rate of celebrity 
marriage break-ups over ten years was worked out from an examination of 
572 prominent celebrity weddings since 2000. It found a fifth were over 
within four years, against just one in 20 of all marriages.

The report said there were some starry
happy endings. Kirk Douglas has been married to wife Anne for 58 years,
while Barry and Linda Gibb have notched up 40 years.
