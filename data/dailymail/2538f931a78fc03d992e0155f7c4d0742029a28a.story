While Angelina Jolie's wedding dress may not have won a roundly positive reaction - decorated in Crayola-style doodles by her children - the Hollywood couple's choice of wedding location is proving far more popular. 

News that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie finally tied the knot has prompted a massive surge in traveller interest in the French village where they wed, traffic data from TripAdvisor has revealed. 

Over a one week period, Correns in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region has seen a huge 1,161 per cent uplift in traffic to its listing when compared to the equivalent period in 2013.

James Kay, a spokesperson for the travel website, said: 'It is amazing how quickly a bit of Hollywood glamour can spark global interest in even the smallest destination.

'And the recent surge in travellers researching Correns on TripAdvisor is further proof of that.

'If you are planning a trip there though, you may have to form an orderly queue since it only has one hotel, or you can book one of the 55 holiday rentals currently listed on TripAdvisor.' 

One visitor, who stayed at Auberge du Parc, the only hotel in Correns open to the public, said: 'If you are looking for wonderful food, in a lovely little village, that's what you are going to find here.

'We stayed there for one night. The bedroom and bathroom are spacious with quite simple decoration. But the dinner was one of the best we ever had!'

Another holiday-goer raved, 'The hotel is small and very charming with beautiful decoration in a sort of Italian-Provencal style. We will be back!' 

The superstar couple tied the knot over the weekend in a chapel at Chateau Miraval, their sprawling estate nestled in an ancient village in the south of France.

The chateau is located in the town of Correns, which, according to Miraval's website, is the first 'organic village' in France.

The area is known for wine producing and the village only has one hotel which is open to the public

The property is surrounded by a moat, and boasts a spa, two gyms, and an indoor swimming pool.

The grounds feature a lake and are lush with forest, olive trees, and vineyards.

The pair first leased the 35-bedroom property in 2008, before purchasing it for a reported $60 million in 2012.

They allegedly spend their summers at the 1000-acre estate with their six children.

The home is also where Brad proposed to Angelina in early 2012, and where she spent the last few months of her pregnancy with twins Knox and Vivienne in 2008.

It's not the first time the sleepy village has found fame. In 1979 the rock group Pink Floyd recorded part of their album The Wall at Studio Miraval in Correns.
