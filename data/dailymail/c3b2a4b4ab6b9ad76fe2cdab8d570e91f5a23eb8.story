It is not often that skyscrapers double up as theme park rides - but this new design for a building in Miami is breaking the mold.

Plans for the unusual SkyRise Miami have just been approved, combining two thrilling rides with a building that looks like a giant slide.

The £262million ($428million) construction is set to become an icon in the Florida city as Miami's tallest building, standing at 1,000ft high - and has already been dubbed 'Miami's Eiffel Tower'.

Deluxe: The £262 million project will include three observation decks and exclusive night clubs

Jewel of the harbour: SkyRise Miami will rise out of Port Miami to be an unmissable 1,000ft

Outside entertainment: With nightlife sorted, the building also features three rides for thrill-seekers

And while it will boast three observations decks, a sky-high bar and nightclub, it is the idea for two thrilling rides that has caught the public's attention.

Thrillseekers will be able to indulge in SkyRise Drop, and experience that allows people to base jump off the skyscraper attached to a 'high-speed controlled-descent wire'.

And if that isn't enough, they will also be able to try SkyPlunge, being locked into a harness before freefalling 50 stories. 

An exclusive club and a bar will cater for adults wand the SkyRise Flying Theater will provide additional entertainment.

The Sky High Club will be the height of exclusivity for the vibrant Miami and South Beach club scene being 1,000ft up while a fine dining restaurant will have the same views a floor down in a more subdued setting.

For the rides, SkyRise Drop is essentially a base-jumping experience with a high-speed controlled-descent wire system instead of self-activated parachute.

The second ride, SkyPlunge, will see visitors strapped into a harness and sent into a 50-storey drop before a rapid deceleration keeps them from the ground.

Finally, the SkyRise Flying Theater is a motion-based simulator similar to Soaring at Disney World’s Epcot.
