Sportsmail's Jeff Powell was recognised for his outstanding contribution to sports journalism with a lifetime achievement award at the Sports Journalists’ Association annual ceremony on Monday night.

In a career that has spanned more than 50 years, Powell has covered some of the most iconic moments in sporting history with inimitable style and skill. He has written for the Mail for more than 40 years, covering 11 World Cups and countless world title fights.

Beginning his career on local newspapers in his native east London, Jeff Powell joined the Daily Mail in 1966. He has crafted a matchless writing style, uniquely suited to the high drama of sport, and can  effortlessly capture the atmosphere of the most historic of sporting occasions.

Powell has always maintained close relationships with some of sport’s greatest icons.

He
 was a close friend of Bobby Moore, helping England’s World Cup hero to 
write his autobiography and composing the inscription that adorns 
Moore’s statue outside the new Wembley Stadium.

In 2012, Powell was the only British journalist to be invited to Muhammad Ali’s 70th birthday party.

The
 recognition by the SJA of a lifetime’s work is just one in a long line 
of tributes to one of the heavyweights of British sports journalism.
