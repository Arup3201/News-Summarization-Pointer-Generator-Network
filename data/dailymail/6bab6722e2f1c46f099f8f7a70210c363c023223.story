Everton manager Roberto Martinez has hinted that striker Samuel Eto'o could be on the verge of leaving Goodison Park.

Martinez confirmed that the former Barcelona forward, who missed the Toffees' penalty shootout defeat at West Ham in the FA Cup on Tuesday, has been the subject of interest from two unnamed clubs.

Eto'o only signed a two-year contract with Everton in August and has found the back of the net four times for the Toffees since then but has often found himself playing in a number 10 role and even out wide.

'With Samuel, we have a really good relationship and we are looking at his situation,' Martinez said in the wake of Everton's 9-8 shootout defeat at the Boleyn Ground where the match ended 2-2 after extra-time.

'We had a couple of clubs contact us in the last 12 hours so I decided it was better now to leave him out of the squad and allow us a different focus in the group.

'We will decide (in the) next few days the next step. He's been fantastic for us, we've got a really good relationship and we will see what's (the) next best step for both (parties).'

Eto'o scores for Everton against Burnley in the Premier League match at Turf Moor last October

If the former Cameroon international does leave Merseyside for pastures new his brace at Burnley in October will undoubtedly be the highlight of his time with the Blues.

The 33-year-old's glancing header opened the scoring and then he capped off a fine display with a superb strike from 25 yards as the Toffees won 3-1 at Turf Moor.

When asked if Eto'o has played his last game for the Toffees, Martinez added: 'No, I wouldn't say that.'
