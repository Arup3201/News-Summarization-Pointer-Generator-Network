The Queen said last night that she was ‘humbled’ by the reaction to her Diamond Jubilee celebrations, as more than a million cheering wellwishers surged into The Mall to pay their respects.

Indeed, so moved was the monarch by the unbridled public euphoria surrounding four remarkable days of national festivities, that she chose, almost on the spur of the moment, to make a rare public address.

Filmed just before the start of Monday night’s Diamond Jubilee concert and broadcast around the globe yesterday evening, the Queen said she was ‘deeply touched’ at the way the celebrations  had brought communities around the country together.

'Deeply touched': The Queen delivers a rare address to the nation and the Commonwealth from Buckingham Palace to thank all those behind her Diamond Jubilee celebrations

‘The events that I have attended to mark my Diamond Jubilee have been a humbling experience. 
‘It has touched me deeply to see so many thousands of families, 
neighbours and friends celebrating together in such a happy atmosphere,’
she said.

The Queen's speech in full:

The events that I have attended to mark my Diamond Jubilee have been a humbling experience.

It has touched me deeply to see so many thousands of families, neighbours and friends celebrating together in such a happy atmosphere.

But Prince Philip and I want to take this opportunity to offer our special thanks and appreciation to all those who have had a hand in organising these Jubilee celebrations. 

It has been a massive challenge, and I am sure that everyone who has enjoyed these festive occasions realises how much work has been involved.

I hope that memories of all this year’s happy events will brighten our lives for many years to come. 

I will continue to treasure and draw inspiration from the countless kindnesses shown to me in this country and throughout the Commonwealth.

Thank you all.

She also expressed her gratitude to all those who had helped to organise events, including Sunday’s River Pageant, and concluded: ‘I hope that memories of all this year’s happy events will brighten our lives for many years to come.

‘I will continue to treasure and draw inspiration from the countless kindnesses shown to me in this country and throughout the Commonwealth. Thank you all.’

The last time the Queen addressed the nation outside her annual Christmas speech was following the death of Princess Diana in 1997.

Filming took place in the private Presence Room at Buckingham Palace, with one of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s official engagement portraits behind her.

The Queen wore a pale blue day dress by Karl Ludwig Couture and her stunning Cartier aquamarine and diamond clips, which were an 18th birthday present from her parents in 1944.

Aides said she made the decision to film her address only last Wednesday after witnessing the groundswell of public support in the run-up to the Jubilee weekend.

She also stoically chose to go ahead hours after her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, was taken to hospital with a bladder infection.

The couple have been married for 64 years and the Queen openly credits him as being her ‘strength and stay’ for the six decades of her reign.

Her husband was clearly on her mind throughout yesterday’s Jubilee Ceremonial Day which saw her attend a National Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral before a carriage procession through the streets of London and a fly-past over Buckingham Palace.

As she stepped on to the balcony at the palace to a deafening roar of applause, she turned to her grandson Prince William and said wistfully: ‘I wish Philip were here.’

Then, as the National Anthem echoed out, the normally restrained sovereign appeared to blink back tears.

Yesterday’s balcony scene was a tight-knit affair with just the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry present.

It was markedly different from the Queen’s Golden and Silver Jubilees, when more than 30 royals appeared with her at the palace. Sources suggested it was a conscious effort by the sovereign to focus attention on her immediate successors.

Prime Minister David Cameron summed up the mood of the nation when he said the celebrations had shown the ‘best of Britain’.

He hailed the Queen as ‘a real 
inspiration’, and, in a reference to the Duke of Edinburgh’s illness and
the wet weather, praised the ‘great resilience’ of both the sovereign 
and her subjects.

He said: 
‘I think what we’ve seen, frankly, is the best of Britain. We’ve seen 
people coming together in tremendous unity and spirit to celebrate the 
Queen’s jubilee, but we’ve also seen a great resilience; people wanting 
to celebrate, even though the weather’s been pretty bad, and an 
extraordinary resilience on behalf of Her Majesty, who in spite of all 
the problems and difficulties has kept going, and with such incredible 
spirit. She’s a real inspiration.’

US
President Barack Obama, with whom the Queen has developed a warm 
relationship, sent a video message from the White House, saying: ‘While 
many presidents and prime ministers have come and gone, Your Majesty’s 
reign has endured.’

The 
Queen was due to stay at Buckingham Palace last night because she has a 
lunch with Commonwealth heads of government at Marlborough House in 
London today.

In the absence of the Duke of Edinburgh she will instead be escorted by one of her ladies-in-waiting.
