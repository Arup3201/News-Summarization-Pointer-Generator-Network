NBA great Charles Barkley has spoken his mind once again, this time to voice support for the grand jury that chose not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

Barkley, 51, isn't known for keeping opinions to himself and the African American basketball legend was in top form Tuesday when he addressed the controversy in Missouri during a radio interview.

'There is no excuse for people to be out there burning down people's businesses, burning down police cars,' he told Mike Missanelli of Philadelphia's 97.5 The Fanatic as he referred to the rioters as 'scumbags.'

Supports the police: Former NBA star Charles Barkley told a Philadelphia radio show host last week that he supports the Ferguson police and the grand jury's decision not to indict unarmed black teen Michael Brown's killer Darren Wilson

The former 76er told Missanelli that he believes black neighborhoods would crumble if not for the help of police

Barkley went on to commend police who work in black areas. 

'If it wasn’t for the cops we would be living in the Wild, Wild West in our neighborhoods,' he said. 'We can’t pick out certain incidentals that don’t go our way and act like the cops are all bad.

'Do you know how bad some of these neighborhoods would be if it wasn't for the cops?' he said.

Barkley, who's become a high-profile sports commentator since leaving the NBA behind in 2000, said the media is at fault for at least some of what's gone on in the wake of Michael Brown's August 4 death.

'The true story came out from the grand jury testimony,' he said. 'I can’t believe anything I hear on television anymore.

'And, that’s why I don’t like talking about race issues with the media anymore, because they  love this stuff, and lead people to jump to conclusions.

'The media shouldn’t do that. They never do that when black people kill each other.'

Barkley also publicly sided with a decision to exonerate George Zimmerman in 2013 after he was tried in the shooting death of another unarmed black teen, Trayvon Martin, notes the Christian Science Monitor.

Meanwhile, others in the major league sports realm have come forward in recent days to support the outraged black citizens of Ferguson.

Five St. Louis Rams players stood on Sunday with their arms raised in an apparent show of solidarity for Ferguson protesters before trotting onto the field for pregame introductions.

Wide receivers Tavon Austin and Kenny Britt came out together first, with the move obscured by a smoke machine in the upper reaches of the Edward Jones Dome. Stedman Bailey, Jared Cook and Chris Givens — all of whom are black — then came out and stood together with arms raised.

After Tre Mason scored on an 8-yard run to make it 45-0 in the fourth quarter, he and Britt raised their hands together.

Looters robbed Ferguson businesses and set fire to property in the wake of the grand jury decision not to convict Darren Wilson, which many have criticized as a step in the wrong direction for the town where tensions between citizens and police have long been an issue

There have been riots, looting and buildings burned in Ferguson since a grand jury declined Monday to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed Michael Brown in August.

Across the street from the stadium, about 75 protesters gathered in the second half as about 30 police wearing riot gear watched from a safe distance. Protesters chanted "Hands up, don't shoot!" ''No Justice, No Football!" ''This is what Democracy looks like," and "We're here for Mike Brown."

The Rams had additional security measures in place for the game, including armed personnel from the National Guard. The team has wanded fans outside entrances all season.

On another front inside the stadium, a group of fans formed letters spelling "Keep the Rams in St. Louis" in seats in the north end zone.

A different reaction: St. Louis Rams players, from left; Stedman Bailey (12), Tavon Austin (11), Jared Cook, (89) Chris Givens (13) and Kenny Britt (81) raise their arms in awareness of the events in Ferguson, Mo.,  as they walk onto the field during introductions before an NFL football game against the Oakland Raiders in St. Louis
