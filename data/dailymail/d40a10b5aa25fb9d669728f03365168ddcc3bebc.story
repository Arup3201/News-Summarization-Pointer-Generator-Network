There were nearly 6,000 victims of sexual assault in the U.S. military this year, up eight per cent from last year, according to a new study.

The Pentagon report, based on an anonymous survey and shared with the Associated Press, also found that retaliation remains an ongoing problem  in  stern military culture that emphasizes rank, loyalty and strength.

Indeed, 60per cent of the women who reported some type of unwanted sexual contact complained about social backlash from co-workers or other service members.

Ongoing problem: There were nearly 6,000 victims of sexual assault in the U.S. military this year, up eight per cent from last year, according to a new study

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., a leading advocate for improvements in protecting victims of sexual assault, pointed to the retaliation figures as troubling.

'For a year now we have heard how the reforms in the previous defense bill were going to protect victims, and make retaliation a crime,' she said. 

'It should be a screaming red flag to everyone when 62per cent of those who say they reported a crime were retaliated against - nearly two-thirds - the exact same number as last year.'

Under fire from Congress, Pentagon leaders and the White House, the military services have launched programs to encourage reporting, provide better care for victims, step up prosecutions and urge troops to intervene when they see others in threatening situations.

'Pending the report's public release Thursday, assuming news accounts are correct - reporting of assaults being up and incidents of assault being down are exactly the combination we're looking for.

'I'm sure there's more work to do, and I'm anxious to hear how victims feel about the services and support offered to them when they report an assault,' said Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.

In May, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel declared sexual assaults as a 'clear threat' to service members and he ordered a number of new initiatives, including the review of alcohol sales and policies. 

He said the review must address the risks of alcohol being used as a tool by predators to ply a victim with drinks before attacking.

According to the new Pentagon survey, some of that may be taking hold. 

Officials said an overwhelming majority of those who filled out the survey said they took action to prevent an assault when they saw a risky situation.

The services also created hotlines, plastering phone numbers and contact information for sexual assault prevention officers across military bases, including inside the doors of bathroom stalls. 

And they expanded sexual assault prevention training, hired victims' advocates and response coordinators, and have tried to curtail drinking, which is often a factor in assaults.

The new report comes as Congress continues to press for an overhaul of the military justice system to change the way that sexual assault cases are handled.

Defense officials discussed the results with the White House on Tuesday and were expected to release the reports publicly on Thursday.

The Pentagon cites the spike in sexual assault cases as increased trust in the military justice system.

According to the latest report, one in four victims of sexual assault reported the crime in 2014 compared to one in ten two years ago.
