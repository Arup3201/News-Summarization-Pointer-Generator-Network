A couple who went through four failed IVF cycles have finally become parents after a friend offered to carry their pregnancy as a surrogate.

West Virginia-based Sandi and Philip Palmisano, aged 46 and 44 respectively, were on standby as Andrea Rivas gave birth to their fraternal twins, EmmaLee and Grayson, on February 4 via a planned C-section.

Mrs Rivas, 28, who has two-year-old twins herself via IVF, told the Today show that 'now we have four miracles between all of us' and she and her husband, Mark, 39, think of the Palmisano's children as 'cousins' to their own.

Meanwhile an emotional Mrs Palmisano added: 'It's just very overwhelming . . . the journey was very difficult.

'[But] the joy that Andrea and Mark has [given us] is hard to put into words.'

The Palmisanos and Rivases met while they were receiving treatment at the Shady Grove Fertility Center near Washington, D.C back in 2010.

While the Rivases witnessed success the Palmisanos found that they were getting 'nowhere'.

Act of kindness: Mrs Rivas put herself forward as a gestational surrogate after getting the go-ahead from her husband - she gave birth this February via a planned C-section

Doctors told them they would need a gestational carrier to move forward with treatment.

Mrs Palmisano mentioned this 'blow' to Mrs Rivas while attending a friend's baby shower and was surprised when Mrs Rivas - then eight months pregnant - put herself forward.

Recalling the event, Mrs Rivas told the Herald Mail Media: 'Even though I was pregnant with my twins and I hadn’t even talked to my husband about it, I blurted out, "I will do it for you."

'With this journey together, growing our children and giving birth to our children, we've grown even closer'

'I think we both were a little surprised that those words were coming out of my mouth, but I truly was sincere.'

After getting the go-ahead from her husband and giving birth to her own boy and girl twins, Connor and Avery, on February 1 2012., Mrs Rivas became a gestational surrogate for the Palmisanos.

The first two embryo transfers failed but the third time around everything went according to plan.

The couples got together, sharing images of prenatal scans and the Palmisanos even took Mrs Rivas her favorite snacks as she witnessed pregnancy cravings.

They also took dozens of photographs with Mrs Rivas. One humorous shot shows Mrs Rivas with the Palmisanos holding a sign reading 'Their buns my oven.'

Sleeping soundly: Doctors delivered 6lb Grayson and 7lb  EmmaLee within one minute of each other

Hard work: The new twins go through 22 diapers and 16 bottles a day

The mother-of-two delivered the Palmisanos’ babies in February at the Meritus Medical Center in Hagerstown, Maryland.

She could only have one other person with her in the operating room, and it was decided that Mrs Palmisano would be present, while both husbands waited outside.

'It was incredible to have Sandi with me and to see the look on her face when she saw her beautiful babies for the first time,' Mrs Rivas recalled.

Doctors delivered 6lb Grayson and 7lb  EmmaLee within one minute of each other. The twins now require 22 diaper changes and 16 bottle feeds a day, leaving their parents with around four hours of sleep as they stir throughout the night.

Thankfully the Palmisanos have been receiving lots of tips from the Rivas' on bringing up the twins and the couples meet up on a regular basis.

Touching on her friendship with Mrs Rivas, Mrs Palmisano concluded: 'We have a beautiful relationship. I love her like a sister.

'With this journey together, growing our children and giving birth to our children, we’ve grown even closer. I know, without a shadow of doubt, we are lifelong friends and we’ll remain very close for the remainder of our lives.'
