After days of playing golf and eating out with friends at Hawaii's most exclusive restaurants, Obama returned to some official business yesterday as he laid a wreath at a memorial honouring those killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.

The
 president was joined at the USS Arizona Memorial by his wife, Michelle, just before sunset. After a moment's silence, the Obamas 
scattered orchids into the water.

This year marks the 70th 
anniversary of the Japanese attacks, which claimed the lives of 2,390 
Americans and brought the United States into the Second World War.

The President is in Hawaii for his annual Christmas vacation. Several White 
House staffers who traveled to Honolulu with Obama joined the 
president at the short service.

The first couple were also joined by Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Robert Willard and his wife Donna.

The President swapped his relaxed vacation outfit of t-shirt and chinos for a dark suit as he and the First Lady visited the site - the first time since he came here in late 2008 as president-elect.

The Obamas laid a wreath adorned with a ribbon reading 'In Loving Memory' and dropped the petals into the water beneath the memorial, where the sunken battleship still rests. Nearly 1,200 American sailors died aboard the Arizona.

Michelle Obama was dressed in an 
unusual, block-pattered dress of green and black with a striped panel. 
She has come under the microscope for her holiday wardrobe after 
stepping out on Christmas Day in a dress worth $2,000. Later that day, 
she appeared in a $950 skirt at a meet-and-greet with service members 
and their families.

Earlier on Thursday, Obama had taken 
his wife and two daughters Malia and Sasha to the beach, then stopped 
for shave ice, a Hawaiian version of the snow cone.

One of only 15 Marines to survive the 1941 attack on the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor has died at a Texas hospice.

Lamar Crawford Sr, who was 91, died last week. His funeral was held on Wednesday.

Crawford, from Arkansas, was assigned to the USS Arizona in 1940. On December 7, 1941, he was on the ship's rear tower when it exploded and began sinking.

Crawford's recollections are among stories of survivors at the Pearl Harbor Visitors Center.

'I heard the sound of airplane motors, several of them,' he wrote. 'Looking up I saw a Japanese dive bomber coming directly toward the Arizona.

'Explosions and fires were raging uncontrolled throughout the ship. I dived into the water... a motor whaleboat, manned by two Navymen, pulled alongside me, helped me into the boat, and then the three of us continued through the area pulling other men from the water until we couldn't take on any more.'

Crawford was discharged in 1946 and he worked as a postal inspector after the war, retiring in 1976.

He is survived by Mildred Crawford, his wife of 69 years.

The President is making the most of his annual vacation in Hawaii, having teed off three times so far at the Ko’olau Golf Club.

After
 several hours on the course on Wednesday, the president kicked back 
with the First Lady, his sister Maya Soetoro-Ng, and several other 
friends at one of Honolulu’s priciest restaurants.

The presidential motorcade made a 
stop last night at Alan Wong’s Restaurant, located close to the Honolulu
 area where Obama spent his teenage years.

The Obamas sat down in a group of ten to a five-course 
dinner that include such menu items as the 'sassy salad' and a 
bacon-wrapped pork loin - for $75 each ($110 for wine pairings with each
 course).

Desserts included Kula 'Strawberries 
Romanoff' - a Hawaii Island Dairy Goat Cheese Panna Cotta, 
Strawberry-Hibiscus Consomme with Goat Cheese Sorbet.

The restaurant confirmed to MailOnline that the President's daughters Malia and Sasha did not join their parents for dinner.

Press pool reports said that snap-happy gawkers inside and outside the restaurant were chased away when 
pulling out their cameras.

The president has stayed largely out 
of the spotlight since arriving Friday evening in Hawaii, the state 
where he was born and mostly raised.

He spent a low-key holiday with his 
family, attended Christmas church services and visited service members 
stationed at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, near Honolulu.

The
 First Family has attracted criticism as their annual vacation this year
 is likely to be their most expensive ever. They are expected to return 
to Washington shortly after New Year.

The President travelled separately because he wanted resolve the payroll tax cut issue before leaving Washington D.C.

Mrs Obama took the children two 
weekends ago in a flight that cost an extra $100,000 - and her husband’s
 round-trip journey will be $3,271,611.

His flight was estimated by the Hawaii Reporter as the largest expense of the holiday trip.

It
 will cost more than $4million in total. But his family is covering the 
cost of a private beach front residence in Kailua, Oahu, which costs up 
to $3,500 a day, or $75,000 a month.

It
 was not the only controversy of the holiday. It was revealed that one 
of Obama's golfing companions and old high school buddies, Robert 
'Bobby' Titcomb, was arrested earlier in the year in a prostitution 
sting.

Titcomb was one of four men who allegedly approached an undercover police officer for sex in downtown Hawaii on April 4.

A judge fined him $500 but accepted his request for a deferral, meaning the charge will be wiped off his record if Titcomb stays out of trouble for six months.
