It can be hard to address the elephant in the room; however it becomes considerably easier when one is standing in your lounge.

Staff at a game reserve in Zululand, South Africa found themselves with an unusual problem after a 10-day-old baby elephant ran away from its mother and ended up in their garden.

Owner Francoise Maldy Anthony and her colleagues could not believe their eyes when the little explorer then stumbled into her front room.

How did she get here? The female baby elephant, named Tom after the member of staff who found her in the garden, was estimated to be just over one week old when it got lost and walked into the living room

Lost little one: Francoise Maldy Anthony has owned the Thula Thula Private Game Reserve ranch for 15 years but said she has I have never experienced anything like it

The young female, named Tom after the 
ranch’s chef who first discovered the elephant in the garden, is thought
 to have travelled around 30 miles before ending up at Thula Thula 
Private Game Reserve on Tuesday night.

Mrs
 Anthony and her staff ensured that the baby elephant had food and water
 as rangers headed out on the reserve to track down her mother.

Mrs
 Anthony, who has owned the reserve for 15 years, said she has never 
experienced anything like this – and was shocked to find that the baby 
was the calf of an elephant her husband had rescued several years 
earlier.

‘She must be like the littlest hobo as baby elephants never ever get lost from their herd.

‘It's
 also remarkable that she ended up at my home - we have 4,500 hectares 
of land and she was spotted a day before she arrived at my home with her
 herd at the other end of the reserve.

‘She had walked miles to get here and was quite distressed when she arrived - she looked tired, thirsty and hungry.’

Mrs
 Anthony and her staff left Tom the elephant free to roam and were 
careful not to have too much contact with the animal, fearing it might 
make her mother reject her.

‘Her
 mother - who we rescued from a neighbouring reserve which was going to 
allow a hunter in to shoot her - was delighted when Tom was finally 
reunited with her.

‘I can't say the same for Tom - she must be a bit of a renegade as she tried to run after the van as we pulled away.

‘She was only here for a few hours before we managed to get her back but it was magical.

‘Her herd was monitored overnight to make sure everything was fine and she was accepted back in.

‘It really is a remarkable rescue story. I tried to take photos but couldn't use the flash as I didn't want to startle her.

‘It was a fantastic experience.’

Francoise now lives alone after she lost her husband Lawrence Anthony two years ago.

He
 was an acclaimed conservationist and novelist who wrote a book entitled
 'The Elephant Whisperer: the Extraordinary Story of One Man's Battle to
 Save His Herd'.

Francoise 
added: ‘Some people on Facebook said that it was just too much of a 
coincidence that out of the 4,500 hectares available this elephant chose
 to make her way to my garden.

‘Lawrence
 was famous for the work he did saving elephants and even saved Tom's 
mother - people are saying the elephant needed saving and was drawn 
here.

‘I don't really know about that but I am sure that she couldn't have spent much longer out there alone.

‘She was very dehydrated and very stressed - she had been walking for an incredibly long time.

‘The
 important thing is she is back with her mother and herd and can now 
continue with them - unless she decides to wander off again.’
