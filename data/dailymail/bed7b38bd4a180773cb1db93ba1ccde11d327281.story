A Manhattan skyscraper was evacuated after a fake grenade was sent to the office of retired U.S. General David Petraeus.

The former CIA director's secretary opened a box around midday yesterday and discovered what she thought was a real explosive.

She contacted police who later said the grenade was a 'novelty item' sent by a friend of Petraeus.

A fake grenade was sent to the Solow Building in New York (left), which houses the office of former U.S. General David Petraeus

The 50-storey Solow Building on 58th Street was evacuated and the street shut down between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.

It is unclear if Petraeus was in the building at the time, according to NY1.

His office has not replied to calls for comment.

Petraeus was recently harassed by an angry mob of students as he walked to his first day of teaching at City University of New York's (CUNY) Macaulay honors college.

Petraeus took a teaching job at CUNY after resigning from his position at the helm of the CIA last year following revelations he had an extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell (above)

Students surrounded the four-star 
general on a sidewalk and yelled 'War criminal!' and 'You have blood all
over you!' according to a video of the confrontation that was posted on
YouTube.

He took the teaching job after resigning from his position at the helm of the CIA last year following revelations he had an extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell.

Petraeus has said he has decided to forgo the offered $200,000 salary and take a token salary of $1, according to reports

The salary sparked outrage among faculty routinely seen picketing through the streets of the city demanding higher wages and better health insurance.
