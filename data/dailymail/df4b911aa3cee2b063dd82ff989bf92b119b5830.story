It once seemed as though the stories at Rangers and Hearts were twinned.

Under the respective regimes of Craig Whyte and Vladimir Romanov, both clubs endured high-profile turmoil. Both amassed substantial debts and both plunged into administration.

It was then, however, that the tales diverged. Regardless of the on-field outcome on Saturday, you have to think Rangers fans are looking eastwards with a sense of envy.

Rangers remain in turmoil, despite Charles Green's consortium's asset purchase at Ibrox

Two years and five months after Charles Green’s consortium completed an asset purchase at Ibrox, this institution of Scottish sport remains mired in discord.

Trust between the fanbase and those in charge is somewhere between scant and non-existent. League attendances have dipped below 30,000. Redundancies have taken place within administrative staff.

The financial situation is perilous. Mike Ashley has provided a loan to assume effective control, but Rangers have admitted more money will be needed before the end of the year. No one has yet spelled out a longer-term vision for the future.

Added to that, the team is currently six points adrift of a Hearts side assembled on a significantly smaller budget.

That view from the summit of the Championship is not the only thing for Tynecastle season-ticket holders to enjoy right now.

Thanks to the financial backing of businesswoman Ann Budge, the club emerged from administration with a credible strategy for fan ownership.

Budge’s intentions are clear. To fund a CVA for the Foundation of Hearts, she stumped up £2.5million which will be paid back through the on-going contributions of rank-and-file supporters.

Budge intends to fill the role of chairperson for between three and five years, by which point it is hoped £6m will have been raised and the club will be in full fan ownership. 

That precious commodity of trust seems in fulsome supply around Gorgie. Supporters have reacted positively to further moves from the new regime, such as introducing a living wage for all staff. A museum within Tynecastle has also been mooted. There has been a re-connection between those in the stands, those in the boardroom and those in the changing room.

The contrast with Rangers is profound. Clearly, the very different ways in which the clubs handled administration set their future patterns.

Paul Goodwin, formerly of Supporters Direct Scotland, was a community ownership middle man between the previous Lithuanian owners at Tynecastle and Foundation of Hearts. Like many, he sees a great opportunity lost where Rangers are concerned.

‘From the start of the process at Rangers and the start of the process at Hearts, the similarities were there,’ he said. ‘The biggest difference was the appointment of the administrators.

‘Hearts brought in Bryan Jackson, who knows and understands community ownership and was involved with Dunfermline, Hearts and Portsmouth. He believes it is more than the numbers that matter at a club.

‘It’s also about the heart and soul of the club, which rests in the community.

‘The sad thing for Rangers was that they had a far bigger community than Hearts and didn’t tap into it. That came down to the administrator.

‘Part of the administrator’s duty is to make sure that when he leaves that business it has a long-term strategy to survive.

‘Did that happen at Rangers after Duff & Phelps left? The answer is no. There was not a succinct, rock-solid business plan that would make the future secure.

‘Had the Rangers fans galvanised and got together at that time then, with an administrator like Bryan Jackson, that could have happened.

‘Bryan took a more holistic approach to the welfare of Hearts. He had other bids that were higher, but didn’t want to take the risk. The Foundation of Hearts demonstrated, via their 8,500 supporters, that there was an ongoing willingness to work with business people hand in hand. That is the perfect marrying of models.’

The clear-eyed planning has extended beyond finance. On her first day of control, Budge authorised a ruthless series of cuts to the playing and coaching staff. It was brutal and unquestionably painful for some of those involved. But it made for a clean break.

Appointing Craig Levein as director of football and Robbie Neilson as head coach has delivered swift dividends.

It’s still too early in the season for definite predictions of success, but the signings made have improved and galvanised an existing core of talented youngsters. Neilson has taken a first senior coaching role in his stride, often delivering vibrant football. Levein is on hand to provide shrewd counsel.

‘Your driving model has to be the sustainability of the club,’ added Goodwin. ‘What Rangers has never had since 2012 is a sustainable business model.

‘They were signing players on £7,000 a week and it was insanity. There was no need to spend what they did coming up through the leagues. They have frittered away vast sums of fans’ money.

‘Then there is the money used by the various owners for their own ends to the detriment of the club.

‘This is where Hearts have got it absolutely spot-on. They will not be spending more money than they bring in.

‘It’s basic, but the added investment in the club is coming purely from contributions from the 8,500 fans who see where their money goes.

‘They know what it is providing when their direct debit goes in on the 20th of the month.’
