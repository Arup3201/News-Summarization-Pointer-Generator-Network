Surrounded by beautiful young women, flying in private jets, and shopping for the top designer labels, pictures posted by Zhang Jiale on China's answer to Twitter give a glimpse in to how the other half live.

And images of Jiale, said to be 22, living the high life have gone viral in her home country, prompting a wave of jealousy and outrage.

It may look like the playboy lifestyle but according to the website ChinaSmack, Jiale is actually the tomboy daughter of wealthy Sino Life insurance boss Zhang Jun.

The images were all posted on Jiale's Weibo account.

Alongside the pictures, she posted: 'Money can buy a house but not a family. It can buy you a watch but not time.

'It can buy you a bed but not sleep, a book but not knowledge, can buy you medical care but not health.'

Along with a collection of pictures of the heiress socialising with young women, the shots feature an image of Jiale at the helm of a superboat.

In another she is pictured relaxing in first class on a flight, while another shows her at the wheel of a coveted sports car.

Shop till you drop: Zhang Jiale is pictured surrounded by shopping bags from designer labels such as Gucci and Dior

In one shot Jiale is shown swamped by shopping bags from designer brands such as Dior and Gucci.

She has said to have been given the nickname Wu Zetian, the name of a tang Dynasty empress by fellow sports car enthusiasts.

Though some leapt to her defence, others posted jealous comments online in response to the pictures.

One read: 'We do not hate the rich, what we hate is the unfairness behind the wealth.'

The images follow in the footsteps of a Tumblr profile which was viewed around the globe last summer called the Rich Kids of Instagram, which featured a group of American youngsters living the high life.
