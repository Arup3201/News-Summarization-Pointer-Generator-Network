Raymond and Dorothy today: The couple will be celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary in Blackpool

Raymond, 75, a grandfather-of-four, said: 'We've been very happy coming here for many years.

'We've fallen in love with the place and we've never missed a single year.

'I can't really explain what it is we love. The town just has this pull which draws us in each year.

'In 50 years, Blackpool has changed tremendously but it always feels new to us.

'It always feels like there's something new to see up there. We also love to spend whole days walking along the promenade. It never grows old' says Raymond

'We've seen some great shows over the years and they are what make our trips to Blackpool stand out. We've seen Cilla Black, Ken Dodd, Vera Lynn, The Shadows and Cliff Richard.'

Raymond, a retired psychiatric nurse, said he and Dorothy, 71, would spend their trip this year visiting nearby Cleveleys, going to Madame Tussauds, taking a tour around Blackpool FC and seeing the Tower Circus.

He added: 'That's another thing that's changed - the circus. When we first started coming here they had animals but of course that can't happen now.

'But going to the circus and going up the tower is our favourite thing to do.

'It always feels like there's something new to see up there. We also love to spend whole days walking along the promenade. It never grows old.'

Raymond, from Denbigh, insists that Blackpool is returning to its former glory.

He said: 'A few years ago we felt like it started to go downhill a bit and shops started to close down. The place was starting to look a bit empty but it never put us off coming.

'But all that's changed now and it looks fantastic - it is really improving now. The Winter Gardens look great and we really like the shopping centre.'

As well as memories of their first holiday as a married couple the Lancashire resort holds other treasured family moments.

This year Raymond and Dorothy's family will be joining them to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary

Raymond said: 'Our son and daughter used to come with us - our son David, who is now 49, took his first steps in Stanley Park.

'Now our grandchildren come out to see us. We always visit in the summer months because they're off school and can join us.'

This year the couple's daughter Nia, 45, will join them from her North Wales home with her sons Matthew, 18, and Luke, 13.

Raymond and Dorothy, a former dry cleaning company manager, are also grandparents to David's children Jack, 21, and Millie, 17 who live in Birmingham.

He added: 'We've met so many lovely people here and for years there was a big group of us who met here every summer.

'Sadly, we don't do that anymore because people are a lot older now and can't travel as much.

'But our family always come with us which is really nice.

'We've been very happy coming to Blackpool every year and we plan on doing it for as long as we can.

'We don't go abroad because we prefer Blackpool and we hope we can keep up the tradition.'
