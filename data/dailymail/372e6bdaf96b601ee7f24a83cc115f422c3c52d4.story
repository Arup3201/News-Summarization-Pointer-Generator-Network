A Chilean cyclist's quest to bike around the world in five years has ended with his death in a road accident in northeast Thailand.

Police say the 47-year-old Juan Francisco Villa Honorato was hit by a pickup truck and immediately killed Saturday on a highway in Nakhon Ratchasima province.

Col. Torsak Thammingmongkol says the driver was arrested on a charge of causing death by dangerous driving and released on bail. 

Juan Francisco Villa Honorato was killed Saturday after he was hit by a pickup truck in northern Thailand province of Nakhon Ratchasima

The pickup truck ended up on its roof, according to a Thai expat website. 

According to police and accounts on social media, Mr Guillermo was attempting to set a Guinness World Record by cycling 250,000 kilometers (155,350 miles) in five continents in five years. 

His journey started in November 2010 and was scheduled to end in November this year.

The cyclist carried a sign that said he had been to 49 countries and four continents and had suffered from more than 700 flat tires during the process. 

When he reached Mexico in 2012, the 5'9'' man weighed 140 pounds, according to Diario Presente. 

He said he found and ate an anaconda while biking through Brazil. 

He left Chile with 20,000 and has now been all over the Americas, northern Africa and Europe, according to Montenbaik.com 

Mr Guillermo's wife, who he met during his journey, was on another bicycle with their 2-year-old son Lucas and suffered a slight sprain in the accident, said police Col. Torsak Thammingmongkol.

It was not clear how long they had accompanied Guillermo in his round-the-world cycling odyssey. 

Police said that the accident was caused by the driver and that the cyclists were in their own lane.

In 2013, a British couple on a similar round-the-world quest was killed in a road accident in eastern Thailand.

The driver in that case paid a $30 fine. 

The current offense carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. 

Juan Francisco Guillermo's quest to go 155,000 miles on his bike in five years was cut short after the accident
