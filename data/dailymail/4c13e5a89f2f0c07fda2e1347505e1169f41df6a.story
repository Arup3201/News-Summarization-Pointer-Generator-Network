A North Carolina public high school football coach has been told to stop leading his team in prayers, baptizing players or endorsing religion in any way while on the clock.

Coach Hal Capps of Mooresville High School identifies as a ‘very proud Christian,’ but that pride won him a reprimand from the school superintendent after a parent ‘who objects to religious endorsements’ lodge a complaint about his team prayers.

A national organization that advocates the separation of church and state even became involved after a Twitter photo was discovered that allegedly shows Capps baptizing students in an indoor swimming pool.

Show of faith: North Carolina high school football coach Hal Capps of Mooresville has been ordered to stop praying with and baptizing his players

Baptism: Capps was accused by a non-profit of conducting this baptism of his high school team's players. He and the school superintendent denied this baptism was related to the school or team in any way

‘It is a violation of the Constitution for the Mooresville High School football coach to organize, lead, or participate in prayers or other religious proselytizing before, during, or after games and practices,’ Patrick Elliott, staff attorney for the Wisconsin-based nonprofit Freedom from Religion Foundation, wrote in a letter to the school district last fall.

Superintendent Mark Edwards told the Charlotte Observer that he spoke with Capps at the close the football season and ordered him to stop all such religious activities.

Edwards said Capps ‘understood’ he’d broken rules.

The superintendent also said it was a mischaracterization to call the pictured incident a ‘team baptism,’ though he admitted it was held by a church to which many of the team’s players belong.

Capps also appears in a video posted to YouTube in which he leads the team in thanking ‘the big guy.’

According to the letter from the Freedom From Religion Foundation, it was just one of many prayers led by Capps.

‘Students
 have reported that Coach Capps frequently prays with football players 
at team events and encourages them to go to church and to become 
baptized,’ the letter read.

The coach told the superintendent he’ll no longer pray with the team.

‘I think that would help resolve the issue going forward,’ Edwards told the Observer.

Charlotte CBS affiliate WBTV spoke
 to some members of the Moorseville community where the mostly Christian
 residents seem to support Capps despite his clash with the 
Constitution.

Big guy: In addition to the Twitter baptism photo, the Freedom From Religion Foundation pointed to a YouTube video in which Capps leads the team after a win in thanking 'the big guy'

'I think the man, the coach should be able to pray with his players, pray with his players or anybody else that he wants too,' said Betty Lambert.  'That's our right, we as Christians have stood back too long.'

Mooresville native Belvil Sherrill agreed:

'Being a Christian I have no problem with prayer in school or pray anywhere,' he said. 'If a coach was to lead a team in prayer, that's perfectly fine.

'Upsets me that people, I believe what the Bible says, like I said I am a Christian, it upsets that some people can just dictate what you do because of their beliefs and not take into consideration your own.'
