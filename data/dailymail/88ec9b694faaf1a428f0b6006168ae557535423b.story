NBA Commissioner David Stern has seen his fair share of impressive court moves throughout his tenure as head of the U.S. basketball league and he has ruled that President Barack Obama just doesn't have game. 

Despite his loyal Democratic ties, Stern wouldn't stoop so low to compliment Obama on his court performance, saying the Commander-in-Chief has an inflated sense of his ability in an interview released on Friday.

But Stern did have some praise for the president, saying Obama's enthusiasm has done some good for the sport.

Robert
Wolf, a financier and a personal friend of President Obama, serves on 
the President's Council for Jobs and Competitiveness and interviewed 
Stern for a Reuters TV segment, Impact Players.

In
the interview, Wolf heaps praise on the Democrat for his enthusiasm and rated Obama as an impressive player.

'He's
a hoop junkie, I've played with him. I've seen NBA players play with 
him. There's a lot of NBA players that support him,' Wolf said.

But Stern proved he was no sycophant, interrupting the starry-eyed host by stating bluntly, 'He's not that good.'

Wolf couldn't stand the criticism, 'He's pretty good, he's got a nice little crossover,' he insisted.

Stern continued to dismiss the 
complimentary appraisal of the president's game, 'He's a lefty and goes the same way every time,' he said.

'I'm
a loyal Democrat okay, a passionate Democrat. He's not as good as he 
thinks he is,' Stern added, showing that when it comes to basketball, 
political persuasion doesn't count for much.

But
when Wolf probed the retiring Stern, who will hang up his hat at the 
NBA in 2014 after 30 years, he did admit Obama has made a positive contribution to the 
sport.

'He relates well
to our players. He's got a lot of people around him who are b-ball 
fans ... The players appreciate him for who is,' he conceded.

Indeed,
Obama has been an avid fanatic of basketball - religiously playing the 
game himself with a coterie of close associates who are seasoned professionals.

The elite members of this group include Obama's brother-in-law, Craig Robinson, the men's basketball coach at Oregon State, the President's former aide or 'body man' Reggie Love, who played for Duke's Blue Devils basketball team, and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who played for Harvard and even went pro in Australia for a time.

When
his schedule allows, the president joins an exclusive group of 
players who congregate in the Beltway for some serious pick-up.

At these games, the leader of the free world is looking for a challenge and if players go easy on Obama for fear of offending the 
Commander-in-Chief, they aren't invited back.

Writer Michael Lewis tagged along with the president for one such gathering and described the sacrosanct meetup in a Vanity Fair profile.

'No
one held back, no one deferred. Guys on his team dribbled past him and 
ignored the fact he was wide open. When he drives through the streets, 
crowds part, but when he drives to the basket large, hostile men slide 
over to cut him off,' Lewis wrote, noting how all are equal once they hit the court.

'It’s 
revealing that he would seek out a game like this but even more that 
others would give it to him: no one watching would have been able to 
guess which guy was president,' he added about the fierce competition.

'Obama could find a perfectly 
respectable game with his equals in which he could shoot and score and 
star, but this is the game he wants to play.'

Even though the president insists on a no holds barred match, it went a bit too far in November 2010 when he was 
elbowed during a pickup game the day after Thanksgiving.

He cut his lip and received 12 stitches after the incident.

The player whose move caused the 
injury was identified as Rey Decerega, director of programs for the 
Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute.

'I learned today the president is both a tough competitor and a good sport,' Decerega said about the incident in a statement.

Obama has played the game since he 
was a child and has credited the athletic endeavor to helping him find 
an identify growing up.

'At
least on the basketball court I could find a community of sorts,' he 
wrote in his 1995 book 'Dreams From My Father,' referencing how the sport
embraced him when he struggled to fit in as an African-American.

Gotta love him: Reggie Love (left, playing for Duke in 2005) served as Obama's body man from 2007-2011. Though he has since left the post, they remain close (right, Love and Obama at a game together in July)
