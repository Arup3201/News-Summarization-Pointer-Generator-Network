A London branch of upmarket estate agent Savills has banned its employees having sex at work because used condoms have been clogging up their toilets. 

According to a leaked email allegedly sent by a senior member of staff at Savills in Sloane Street, Pimlico Plumbers spent seven hours working out the cause of problems with the branch's toilets.

Richard Gutteridge, director of residential houses, sent the memo to about 50 members of staff at the branch, warning them 'obviously such activity should not be taking place in the office'.

The emergency plumbing work 'cost the office a considerable amount of money', according to Mr Gutteridge's leaked email.

He said that after working on the toilets for at least seven hours, the plumbers eventually found a mass of used condoms had caused a blockage in the pipes, preventing them draining properly.

'Obviously such activity should not be taking place in the office,' he said.

'As well as it being extremely inconvenient to have both loos out of order for an entire day, this has now cost the office a considerable amount of money,' Mr Gutteridge added.

'Please can we be considerate to the ancient Sloane Street plumbing going forward,' he went on.

Somewhat inevitably the email to staff was leaked, prompting speculation among staff on social networks about which members of staff may have been involved.

The debate led Savills public relations team to contact the Metro to point out that the Sloane Street estate agent actually shares its plumbing system, suggesting its staff may not have been to blame.

'Plumbers were called in on Wednesday to investigate problems with the ladies’ lavatories in Savills Sloane Street office,' the company's head of PR said.

'It was discovered that the main drainage system, which is shared with adjacent buildings, was blocked with debris including condoms,' she added.

'The blockage has been removed and the system is now working,' the spokeswoman said.
