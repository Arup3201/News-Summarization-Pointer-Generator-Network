Martin Murray takes his courage in both fists as he enters the ring in Monte Carlo this Saturday night to confront the most concussive pound-for-pound puncher in the world.

Gennady Golovkin will greet him with a handshake and a smile, followed by flurries of the blows which have knocked out 28 of the 31 victims in his unbeaten professional career.

Call It Fearless vs Fearsome.

Gennady Golovkin: 158.9lb 

(Weight limit: 160lb) 

Murray declares himself ‘unafraid of being hurt’ by the iron-fisted Kazakh and insists he has perceived ‘chinks in Golovkin’s armour which I can exploit to upset the odds.’

If he does, the casinos in the principality will be paying out at 25-1.

Golovkin talks respectfully of our reformed ex-prisoner as ‘a strong fighter who brings my toughest test so far’ but still believes ‘I will end it inside the 12 rounds.’

If he does, Murray will be stopped for the first time in a career in which he has yet to be sent to the canvas.

Not even the only two men to deny Murray victory managed that in his two previous, close-run, world middleweight title challenges.

Felix Sturm was given the benefit of a home-town draw in Germany, Sergio Martinez declared a disputed winner in Buenos Aires.

Golovkin, however, is a more intimidating proposition than either of them.

He not only hits like a steam-hammer to head and body but employs speed, mobility and a profound depth of ring cunning to create the openings for those punches.

The Kazakh is unbeaten in 31 bouts, winning 28 by knockout - including against Daniel Geale (above)

Golovkin sets more traps than a pest control agency and, in professional terms, the consequences can be just as fatal.

The careers of several previously unbeaten challengers for his WBC world title have either been ended instantly by his blows or petered away into premature retirement a few fights later.

Wayne Rooney is expected to be in attendance in the plush ballroom in Monaco, supporting the man from St Helens in the hope that he can deliver a miracle.

Some of Murray’s domestic peers are making persuasive cases for Murray pushing Golovkin to the limit.

Matthew Macklin, who was destroyed by a GGG-force body shot, says: ‘I’m sure Martin will give a very good account of himself.’

George Groves, who could find himself on Golovkin’s dance card in the future, says: ‘Martin is not only tough but a clever fighter and I don’t expect it to be easy for Gennady.’

But neither goes so far as to predict a British upset.

Murray has modified his initial bravado - ‘I’m going to knock his head off’ - by saying: ‘I have given everything humanly possible in training camp. I will give my all in the ring. I do not want to go home with any regrets about having given anything less than my absolute best.’

Murray, having turned his entire life around so admirably that his focus is now on his young family, has the strength of physique and will-power to return home with both his dignity and his future as a fighter intact.

If he rises so spectacularly to the challenge as to rupture Golovkin’s invincibility, he will have won a gamble of James Bond proportions in Monte Carlo.

Golovkin v Murray will be televised live on Channel 5 from 10 pm this Saturday night.
