Prince William could become an air ambulance helicopter pilot instead of starting full-time royal duties this year.

He gave up his job as an RAF search and rescue pilot eight months ago to start a ‘transitional’ year of public service placements as part of his preparation for becoming King.

But sources claim William, 31, has decided he is not ready to move on to full-time royal duties when this period comes to an end in September, and is keen to return to flying.

William hinted at a return to the skies during his family's recent official trip to New Zealand

One option would be to enlist as a pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance, which is based near his country home in Norfolk.

William hinted at a return to the skies during his family’s recent official trip to New Zealand. Touring an aviation museum, he said seeing the historic military aircraft made him ‘long to be flying again’ and revealed that he hoped to obtain a commercial pilot’s licence. He already holds a private pilot’s licence from his time in the RAF.

Acquiring a commercial licence would allow him to fly civilian helicopters such as air ambulances.  

In a possible sign of where his intentions lie, William and the Duchess of Cambridge will meet representatives of the Scottish Air Ambulance Service on a visit to Crieff, near Perth, on Thursday. 

A source said: ‘William has privately said he does not want to give up flying and hopes to find a way to incorporate it into what he does in the future.

‘He will not become a full-time working member of the royal family in September, and Charles and the Queen support him in this.’

However, Kate may have some concerns about her husband becoming a pilot again. Writing in the introduction to a new book, Living In the Slipstream: Life As An RAF Wife, she revealed: ‘I cannot pretend that I didn’t feel anxious at times when William was on shift in howling gales, knowing that he was out flying in extremely challenging conditions.’

On Thursday he will visit an air ambulance team during a trip to Crieff, near Perth, with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge

The East Anglian Air Ambulance was launched in 2000 after an appeal led by jockey Frankie Dettori, who was involved in a plane crash in which the pilot was killed.

Today there are two helicopters, funded by donations, which fly every day of the year, covering Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.  

A Kensington Palace spokesman said: ‘The Duke of Cambridge is currently considering his options and an announcement will be made in due course.’

The East Anglian Air Ambulance was unavailable for comment.
