The nurse who stabbed her four-year-old daughter before cutting her own wrists left a suicide note saying ‘I couldn’t leave her with no mummy, that would be too cruel’.

Dawn Makin, 35, was found lying unconscious next to the body of daughter Chloe Burke on a bed surrounded by cuddly toys at their family home as she faced prosecution over leaking patient information to an accident claims firm.

She was jailed for 12 years yesterday for the killing which she committed while in a ‘spiral of descent into despair’.

In her suicide note, Makin wrote: ‘I’m 
so sorry I have taken her away from you all but I couldn’t leave her 
with no mummy, that would be too cruel, sorry.’

Suicide note: Dawn Makin was jailed for killing her daughter after she stabbed the four-year-old and slit her own wrists, leaving a note reading 'I couldn't leave her with no mummy, that would be too cruel, sorry'

The court heard that Chloe was found in her pyjamas and had suffered deep wounds to her neck and chests and tests showed would have been alive for a number of hours after the attack.

Makin is now confined to a wheelchair due to brain damage caused by swallowing anti-freeze during the attack on Valentine’s Day last year.

The nurse of 15 years was sacked after 
being unmasked as a ‘mole’ for feeding confidential data from Moorgate 
Primary Care centre in Bury, Greater Manchester to her boyfriend Martin 
Campbell, 34, who was trying to sign up patients for a personal injury 
litigation company in 2010.

Permanent brain damage: Makin, here outside court yesterday, is now confined to a wheelchair after swallowing anti-freeze in the killing she committed while in a 'spiral of descent into despair'

So ashamed by what she had done, Makin pretended to her parents that she was still working until she found out that she faced charges for data protection offences.

Prosecutor Stephen Wright said: ‘She did seek further employment but every application floundered. She was getting nowhere.’

Makin had made an earlier attempt to gas Chloe and herself in February last year but stopped before any serious harm was done.

Tried to protect herself: The court heard that Chloe suffered deep wounds to her neck and chest and in juries to her hands showed that the four-year-old tried to protect herself

'Life is not fair': Chloe's father Michael Burke, left, said he felt sorry for Makin, right, because she was not in the right state of mind at the time of killing Chloe who 'was a princess' to him

Judge Anthony Russell said Makin had been suffering from a depressive disorder at the time of the killing. She wept as he jailed her for manslaughter, telling her: ‘The facts of this case are appalling. ‘The victim was a four-year-old child, someone who trusted you.

‘Finally, the physical injuries you have caused to yourself which are permanent and the knowledge you have killed your only child will be with you for the rest of your life.’ 

Injuries on Chloe’s hands show the little girl tried to protect herself, Preston Crown Court heard.

Outside court, Chloe’s father Michael Burke, 40, said of Makin: ‘She had chances to speak to me, but she was too ashamed. 

‘I miss my daughter. She was beautiful and lovely, and she was a princess to me. I just miss her so much… life is not fair.

The day of the killing: Makin sent text messages to recent ex-boyfriend Martin Campbell saying 'I'll make sure you pay for this for the rest of your life' and 'I feel really low. My life is over' before killing Chloe

‘I feel sorry for her in a way, she wasn’t in the right state of mind and didn’t know what she was doing.’

Makin’s boyfriend Campbell, who was fined after admitting data protection offences in June last year, used the details of 29 road accident victims who had been treated at the centre to make contact and try to encourage them to make personal injuries claims in December 2009, the court heard.

Campbell and Makin had then separated causing her ‘great distress’ and on the day of the killing she learned that she had been summoned to court to face data protection offences.

She tried to rekindle her relationship with Campbell but he told her he was taking another woman out to dinner.

She sent text messages to Campbell saying: ‘I’ll make sure you pay for this for the rest of your life’ and ‘I feel really low. My life is over.’
