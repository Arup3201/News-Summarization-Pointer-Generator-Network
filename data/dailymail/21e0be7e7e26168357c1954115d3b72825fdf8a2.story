But, says the 36-year-old, her daughters are exactly what helps keep her in shape.

As Myleene stripped down to her underwear to showcase her new campaign for the collection, which features a selection of sexy pieces, FEMAIL caught up with her to find out the secrets behind her enviable curves.

Look away now, Bridget Jones! Myleene Klass this week unveiled her latest range of lingerie for Littlewoods so FEMAIL caught up with her to find out the inspiration behind her range and exactly how she stays in shape 

Speaking about how she got in shape for her latest shoot, Myleene told MailOnline: 'I'm a single working mother to two young girls, I don't sit down! I swim with them and live in the park whenever the sun is out.' 

Speaking about her diet and whether she embarks on a healthy eating plan for summer, the star said: 'I do what everyone does: hibernate through the winter months and watch what I eat a little more carefully in the summer.'

Clearly watching what she eats has paid off - she looks incredible in the new imagery showcasing her latest designs. 

'Women's wardrobes are more versatile than ever and I wanted my underwear to reflect and compliment that,' she said of her latest range. 

'There are items in the range designed for extra support that look fabulous and feminine, some flirtier, fun items and for the more daring, a half cup bra with extra laced up ribbon detailing. 

'I like the red lace underwear as the shade is in a sumptuous, hot hue, the strapping detail is hugely on trend and ultimately, it feels good to wear.'

Something for everyone: Myleene says that women's wardrobes are more versatile than ever and she wanted her underwear to reflect and compliment that

So does she think wearing nice lingerie is essential for a woman? 'Well put it this way, bad, greying granny pants have never made any woman feel good,' she laughs. 

'The best underwear is the kind that fits,' she continues. 'The dreaded "four boobs" effect or red indentations from ill-fitting underwear is not going to make a woman feel good so ensure you get the measurements right. 

'It’s easy to fall into the habit of buying the same size and style but our bodies change for all kinds of reasons and that's worth bearing in mind when looking buying lingerie.'

The former Hear'Say star has been keeping busy - she recently unveiled a beauty range for the store, too.

 

Animal behaviour: Myleene also recently created a make-up range with Littlewoods and named each of the products after the women in her life

'I like the skin to be the main focus in the summer. I use lighter, more shimmery products in the hotter months,' she said of her beauty regime.

'My new range of make-up (named after the amazing women in my life...I immortalised them in make-up!) consists of the perfect shades.'

And it seems the future is looking bright for Myleene, who famously caught the world's attention in a white bikini in the shower on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.

'I've just had my jabs for a new show I'm working on that will be taking me to the darkest depths of a rainforest, she said. 

'The benefits of having been in the jungle a few times now is that I at least know what to expect and the downside is I know what to expect!

'I do count myself as very lucky to be able to have these opportunities but also can't negate the hard work that goes into it all either.

'I'll definitely be wearing my sturdiest underwear that day...if only to keep out the leeches!'
