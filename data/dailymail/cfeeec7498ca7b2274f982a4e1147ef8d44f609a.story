Smartwatches may come with a host of features, but they're rarely as fashionable and good looking as traditional timepieces. 

With this in mind, a California design team has created the T-Band - a clip that adds similar smart tools to everyday, dumb watches.

The T-Band comes in three versions - a basic activity tracker, a simple touchscreen and an advanced notification display - with prices starting at $129 (£82).

The T-Band was created by California-based Kairos and features a smart module that attaches to watch straps measuring between 18mm and 24mm. It comes in three versions - a basic activity tracker, a simple touchscreen and an advanced notification display - with prices starting at $129 (£82)

The adapter is the brainchild of San Francisco firm Kairos, which has set up an Indiegogo campaign to fund production of the band.

Each band is adjustable and attaches to any watch with straps measuring between 0.7 inches and 0.9 inches (18mm and 24mm).

The T-Band ND is the basic model and works like a fitness band to track steps, sleep patterns and skin temperature.

It uses lights and vibrations to provide basic notifications, and connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth.

An early-bird version of this band is available from $129 (£82).

The second model is called T-Band HD and adds a touchscreen to the watch’s strap. This display remains hidden until a notification arrives on a connected phone.  

Prices for the HD start at $159 (£101).

The high-end model is called T-Band OD.

It has a curved, plastic-OLED, scratch-resistant touchscreen and adds images, videos, and voice calling thanks to a built-in speaker and microphone.

The OD model starts at $179 (£114).

The second model is called T-Band HD and adds a touchscreen to the watch’s strap. 

This display remains hidden until a notification arrives on a connected phone.

LED panels are embedded below a thin ‘membrane’ and when turned off, the HD looks like the ND.

Videos and images can’t be displayed on the HD, and prices for the HD start at $159 (£101).

The high-end model is called T-Band OD.

It has a curved, plastic-OLED, scratch-resistant touchscreen and adds images, videos, and voice calling thanks to a built-in speaker and microphone.

The OD model starts at $179 (£114).

Battery life across the HD and OD models are between two and three days on a full charge, while the ND lasts around seven days.

All three bands are water and dust resistant to IP67 standard, and are powered by an Arm Cortex M4 processor.

They each run a custom-made operating system, too, meaning they are compatible with all iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices.

Each of the bands can be pre-ordered from Kairos’ Indiegogo campaign, which runs until 31 December.

The firm is hoping to raise $50,000 (£31,800) and has achieved more than $8,690 (£5,544).

It the campaign is successful, the bands will be shipped after April 2015.
