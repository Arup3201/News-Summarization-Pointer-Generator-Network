Dear West Ham fans,

In my very first column of the season, I wrote that I feared for your team. I was worried that the inconsistencies of the previous campaign, the quality of the performances and the value of the summer signings meant you would flirt with relegation and I predicted you would finish fourth from bottom.

After all the stick I got over the years at Upton Park I find it very hard to apologise to any West Ham fan but, I am happy to admit just this once, that I was wrong about your team.

Hitting form: West Ham's run of four wins in February saved them from relegation

By Sunday night West Ham will still be in the Premier League and comfortably clear of the relegation zone. I could not see that happening at the start of the season. The club and Sam Allardyce have proved me wrong.

Even though his imminent sacking may not come as a surprise, it shows a disappointing lack of loyalty from the West Ham board. What kind of message does it send to a prospective new manager when you ditch a man who has achieved everything asked of him?

At times the football has not been pretty but Allardyce masterminded three big wins over Tottenham and a crucial 0-0 draw at Chelsea. That result sent West Ham on a four-match winning streak — their first in seven years — and was the run that saved their season and kept them up.

It is admirable Allardyce got the chance to see things through, especially with other clubs sacking managers for fun — the bottom three have had seven between them this season – and he has managed in a bullish manner throughout.

On his way: Sam Allardyce is understood to be nearing an exit from Upton Park

They have survived quite comfortably in the end, but there have been problems. Andy Carroll, who Allardyce signed for record money, has scored only twice and his injury saga was a real concern. The away form has barely improved since last season, either.

But Sam is a troubleshooter, the kind of man clubs turn to for a quick fix. Now West Ham’s problem of survival has been solved, the fans and the club are ready for a change. Allardyce will feel aggrieved he lost his job over the brand of football rather than results, but all is not lost.

Tony Pulis was sacked by Stoke in similar circumstances but has evolved and enhanced his reputation with Crystal Palace. If this is the end for Sam, he can easily do the same thing at another top club.

West Ham fans are purists and want their team to play with flair, but we have not seen that for a few generations and any transition will not happen overnight.

Out! West Ham fans let their frustration out on the manager after defeat to West Brom

The team are set up for Matt Jarvis and Stewart Downing to find Carroll with crosses. The new boss will have to make the most of the players he has, making tweaks to the way they play rather having a radical overhaul.

For all the desire to play more attractive football, sacking Allardyce is a huge gamble. The club will want to be a Premier League side when they move into the Olympic Stadium in 2016 and Sam could have provided that stability.

He achieved all that was asked and  usually in business if you meet your objectives, you keep your job. But for West Ham fans football is an entertainment business and they do not feel entertained.

It is not a decision that will be taken lightly, but when Allardyce was booed by his own fans, it was the beginning of the end. It was never an easy relationship but now it’s up to the board to find a new man who fits the bill.

Fresh new start: A new manager could drive West Ham up the league next season

In the spotlight: Yaya Toure, Age 30, Manchester City

He may not be the most original pick for Spotlight but when Yaya Toure said he did not receive enough recognition earlier this season, I could not agree more.

There is a lot of talk at the moment about the development of young English players but any youngster will only take inspiration from what Toure is doing on and off the pitch.

He is one of the most humble people I’ve met in football, he is a team player first and foremost and his individual ability is unquestioned.

Underrated: Yaya Toure has not received the praise he deserves after another superb season

It is rare to find a player who so perfectly mixes pace, power and technique. He can finish like a forward and defend like a centre half, as he proved for Barcelona in the 2009 Champions League final.

If City are struggling to score on Sunday, it will probably be Yaya who pops up with a winner. If he keeps it up I might say he is better than my old team-mate Patrick Vieira. But he’s still got some work to do to match the fantastic Frenchman.
