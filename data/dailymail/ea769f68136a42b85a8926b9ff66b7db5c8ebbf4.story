Pacemakers could soon be powered by energy from the beating heart, finally ending the need for a battery. 

A prototype of a battery-free cardiac pacemaker has been developed by a Swiss researcher based on an automatic wristwatch.

The technology harvests energy from the motion of the heart with the help of 200-year-old principles used to power self-winding watches.

One of the current kind of pacemakers (pictured) could become redundant after researchers make a prototype for a battery-free cardiac pacemaker and they could soon be powered by energy from the beating heart

This means it could remove the need for operations to replace pacemaker batteries about every seven to ten years.

It would also do away with leads that connect the pacemaker inserted in the chest wall with the heart, sending programmed electrical pulses that keep the heart beating regularly.

About 40,000 people in England had a pacemaker to control abnormal heart rhythms fitted last year.

Researcher Adrian Zurbechen, from the Cardiovascular Engineering Group at the University of Bern in Switzerland, said laboratory experiments show the idea can work.

He said ‘Pacemakers have two weak spots.

‘Leads are prone to fracture and the lifetime of batteries is limited.

‘Replacing batteries with alternative power sources would spare patients from repeated interventions and make leads obsolete.’

Mr Zurbechen revealed details of the experimental device at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Barcelona, Switzerland.

The technology is based on a traditional clockwork wristwatch which winds automatically because the rotor inside is turned whenever the watch accelerates due to the movement of the wearer’s arm.

This rotation progressively winds a mechanical spring that, once fully charged, unwinds again and spins an electrical micro-generator.

To develop a pacemaker that operated in a similar way, the researchers copied the wristwatch mechanism, removing unnecessary parts to reduce weight and size and developing a custom-made housing with eyelets so it could be stitched directly onto the heart muscle tissue.

Four years ago Professor Rolf Vogel, a cardiologist and engineer at the University of Bern, had the idea of using an automatic wristwatch mechanism to harvest the energy of heart motion.

Mr Zurbechen said ‘The heart seems to be a very promising energy source because its contractions are repetitive and present for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

‘Furthermore the automatic clockwork, invented in the year 1777, has a good reputation as a reliable technology to scavenge energy from motion.

The new pacemaker means it could remove the need for operations to replace pacemaker batteries about every seven to ten years and do away with leads that connect the pacemaker inserted in the chest wall

‘Batteries are a limiting factor in today’s medical implants. Once they reach a critically low energy level, physicians see themselves forced to replace a correctly functioning medical device in a surgical intervention. This is an unpleasant scenario which increases costs and the risk of complications for patients.’

To test the prototype, the researchers developed an electronic circuit to transform and store the signal into a small buffer capacity and then connected it to a custom-made cardiac pacemaker.

The system worked in three steps. First, the harvesting prototype acquired energy from the heart. Second, the energy was temporarily stored in the buffer capacity. And finally, the buffered energy was used by the pacemaker to apply minute stimuli to the heart.

It was then implanted into pigs where it has successfully restored heartbeat to 130 beats per minute.

Mr Zurbechen said ‘We have shown that it is possible to pace the heart using the power of its own motion

‘The next step in our prototype is to integrate both the electronic circuit for energy storage and the custom-made pacemaker directly into the harvesting device. This will eliminate the need for leads.’

‘Our energy harvesting system is located directly on the heart and has the potential to avoid both disadvantages by providing the world with a batteryless and leadless pacemaker.’

He said the technology has the potential for use in many similar devices, including defibrillators and drug delivery pumps.
