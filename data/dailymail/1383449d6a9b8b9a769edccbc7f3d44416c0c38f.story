There are between 20 and 30 cars that make up the official motorcade of the President of the United States - a security procession that travels, usually at high speeds and with green-light corridors, with the commander-in-chief  everywhere he goes.

A 24-year-old California student has now revealed how she was selected as one of many volunteer drivers to be part of that chain of vehicles, 'following Obama all over San Francisco' for a day - despite having no experience, no training and, in what experts have called the most troubling, no idea what to do in an emergency.

Natalie Tyson even read a college textbook while waiting for the convoy to get back on the road, and posted pictures to her Facebook of the October experience, one of which was captioned: 'Me, wondering why anyone would trust me with a 15-passenger van full of reporters.'

'You know how sometimes you are starting a new job or starting a new course, and you have to come up with three truths and a lie about yourself?” Tyson told The New York Times in a new feature.

'This will be my truth that sounds like a lie.' 

The motorcade is centrally comprised of a Secret Service detail guarding the President, local police as assistance and an ambulance - which remains at the rear with a doctor permanently on board.

However, there are also 'filler' cars in the middle carrying White House personnel, communications staff  and reporters, all of whom travel with the president.

Tyson said that one week before President Obama arrived in San Francisco on October 10, a friend who works at the White House texted her asking if she would be willing to drive a van full of reporters as part of the procession.

She told him she had never driven a van, but had driven a pick-up truck. She also said she had a clean driving record, no criminal history and would be willing to take on the job.

A week later she was on the tarmac at San Francisco International Airport waiting for Air Force One to touch down.

When pressed by The Times on how she would handle an incident such as an attack, Tyson admitted she received little-to-no briefing from the Secret Service before getting behind the wheel of the official van.

She said the main warning was not to hit any police motorcycles, usually driven by local officers. 

Tyson also said that, in the event of an emergency, she would just follow the car in front of her.

'Whatever I am is good enough for them,' Tyson told the newspaper.

In practice, the President travels in a line of vehicles that is referred to as the 'secure package'.

Secret Service agents are trained to pull the secure package out of the motorcade during an emergency.

They would separate from the group and get the President to safety, leaving the other cars behind.

However, having a novice involved in any part of the motorcade poses serious security issues, according to former Secret Service agent Dan Emmett.

'Drove out onto the tarmac at SFO to greet Air Force One,' Tyson wrote with this photo

Emmett, author of Within Arm’s Length: A Secret Service Agent’s Definitive Inside Account of Protecting the President, served as agent between 1983 and 2004.

'If the motorcade ever comes under fire, it’s going to be a problem,' he told The Times.

'There are so many non-law-enforcement vehicles that it’s going to be a goat rope. 

'Everyone will be responding, police officers and the Secret Service, and it will be all these people running around in a panic like the last scene of the ‘Blues Brothers’ movie, when there’s the big police chase that ends in a wreck of 50 police cars.'

Emmett said he used to work as part of the motorcade and the cars being driven by volunteers - something that has been commonplace since the 1980s - were often more problematic than the risk of a skirmish.

'You are face to face with a young person who is just completely full of themselves and enthralled,' Emmett said.

'We were more concerned with that than an attack on the motorcade.'

'Number one thing they told us was not to hit any motorcycle cops. I mean, among other things,' Tyson posted

Tyson said she remained committed to her driving and the motorcade throughout the entire day.

But between official visits and press conferences, there was plenty of time to take photos and read her textbook.

One of her photos, showing Tyson standing in front of Obama's official car, was captioned: 'The president's limo! But he wasn't in there yet, that's why they let me take the picture.' 

Another, taken of the van's side mirror, was captioned: 'Zoomed through the empty streets. People waved and took my picture but I don't think they realized that I'm just me.'

A shot of some parked police motorcycles said: 'Number one thing they told us was not to hit any motorcycle cops. I mean, among other things.'

A final photo with some Secret Service agents said: 'The secret service was surprisingly nice. One guy had to direct me on backing the van into a parking spot - I don't think he realized his job was going to be so hard when he signed up.'

Afterwards, Tyson had the opportunity to meet Obama and take a quick photo.

She said his hands were 'so soft' and that he told her and some other volunteers they were 'the best drivers in San Francisco'. 

'But I think the reporters in my van might say otherwise,' Tyson wrote on Facebook.

Obama was in San Francisco at the time raising campaign money for fellow democrats. 

The White House would not comment on the practice of enlisting volunteers for the official motorcade, according to The Times.

A week before Tyson's involvement, a car accompanying the motorcade for Vice President Joe collided with a police motorcycle in San Francisco, causing damage to the bike but not the officer, The Wall Street Journal reported.

It is not known whether the car was being driven by a volunteer. 

That was not the first incident for a Presidential motorcade.

Killed: Jupiter police officer Bruce St. Laurent, a 20-year veteran of the force, was killed in September 2012 when his motorcycle was struck during President Barack Obama's motorcade

Most recently - in September 2012 - a police officer riding with Obama's convoy in Jupiter, Florida, was killed when his motorcycle was struck while riding with the motorcade.

A look at the history of accidents in the motorcades shows it is predominantly officers on motorcycles that have died.

In this case, the officer - Bruce St. Laurent, a 20-year veteran -  was reportedly hit by Ford F-150 pickup.

No further information about the car or driver was released.

Earlier, in February 2008, Dallas police officer Victor Lozada was killed while participating in the motorcade of Hillary Clinton, who at the time was seeking the Democratic nomination for the presidency and was not yet U.S. Secretary of State.

Dead: The family of Victor Lozada argued in a 2010 that he should not have taken part in the motorcade because he had not properly finished his motorcycle training

Lozada tried to overtake part of the motorcade, in what officials called a 'leapfrog' maneuver, when he ran into a sidewalk and slammed head-on into a concrete outcropping.

In 2010 Lozada's family sued Clinton and the city of Dallas, saying he was not properly trained to take part in the job.

According to The Dallas Morning News, Lozada's motorcycle trainer, Senior Cpl. Dale Erves, wrote that he did not think Lozada was ready to ride on duty, less than one month before the officer's death. 

A January 25, 2008, daily observation report, signed by Lozada and Erves, states that Lozada had made 'so many mistakes' that Erves was scared of how he would perform on-duty.

Lozada had failed that phase of training and needed at least two more weeks of training, the report said.
