Hormone therapy can be medically legitimate, but it can also be used by those wishing to look younger

'Anti-ageing' hormones could in fact shorten your life expectancy.

New research suggests higher levels of hormones can reduce the effect of the body's natural defences against diseases.

The study by scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York found that those in their 90s with naturally low levels of the hormone had a much better chance of living into their 100s than those with above-average levels.

Anti-ageing hormones are a billion dollar industry based on the theory that replenishing hormones, which disappear naturally as you grow older, will restore youth.

The hormones that are administered are mostly human growth hormone (HGH) which makes the body develop another hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and dehydroepiandrostersone (DHEA).

Previous studies have found that using HGH, estrogen and other hormones has dangerous side effects like cancer, joint problems and cardiovascular disease.

But the Albert Einstein study found that low IGF-1 levels might actually be a benefit and a way of predicting if someone is going to live for longer.

The study examined 184 men in their mid-90s over the period of 11 years and found that the chance of living through the length of the study depended on their blood levels of IGF-1.

It found a one nanogram per millimetre decrease in IGF-1 meant the person was going to live a week longer.

In addition, scientists also found people with lower IGF-1 levels who were cancer survivors benefited more from the lower levels found in their blood.

Three years into the study, 75 per cent of people who previous had cancer and low IGF-1 levels were still living, whereas only 25 per cent of participants with past cancer and higher IGF-1 were alive.

Dr. Sofiya Milman, lead author of the study, said: 'In 
light of insufficient scientific evidence [that] HGH in older adults 
offers long-term anti-aging benefits, and with studies indicating that 
low growth hormone levels may actually protect the elderly from ageing 
diseases the risks of using HGH as an anti-aging strategy outweigh the
 potential benefits.'

Growth hormones began as an industry in 1990, in New England, when 12 men over 60 were given injections.

The men found their muscle mass increased, their bone density grew and they had a decline in body fat.

Entrepreneurs quickly took on the study and repackaged it as 'anti-ageing' and began offering it as a service.

Administering HGH is illegal unless a patient has low levels of the hormone; but this diagnosis is subjective, which means some clinics can prescribe the treatment to those who don't need it.

The research was carried out by the same group that found that many people over 100 have a mutation that keeps their IGF-1 levels below average.

Another study in the journal Cell Metabolism said the benefits incurred from a lower level of IGF-1 could also extend to people in middle age, finding that people between the ages of 50 and 65 with a high animal protein consumption had high IGF-1 levels and were four times more likely to develop cancer.

They were also 75 per cent more likely to die over the study period of 18 years.

Dr Milman told LiveScience: 'Growth hormone administration causes ''melting'' of fat and tightening of skin, so one may look better.

'It may be beneficial for maintaining a Hollywood kind of longevity but
 would not serve the public good, in general, as an anti-aging strategy.'

But the relationship between HGH, IGF-1 and life expectancy is very complex, and low IGF-1 could be seen as a double-edged sword, as some studies have said low IGF-1 is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems.
