Southampton fear they will miss out on a permanent move for on loan defender Toby Alderweireld with parent club Atletico Madrid intent on sparking a bidding war for the player.

The Belgium international has impressed for the Saints this season prior to sustaining a hamstring injury at Manchester United in January. His performances have been central to Southampton's attempt to finish in the Premier League's top four, and manager Ronald Koeman wants to make the loan move permanent ahead of the next campaign.

However, Alderweireld's form has not gone unnoticed elsewhere. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is understood to be an admirer of the 26-year-old, while Manchester City remain in the hunt for defensive reinforcements with Manuel Pellegrini yet to find the perfect partner for captain Vincent Kompany.

Both Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala have been given opportunities but have so far not done enough to convince anybody at the Etihad Stadium that they can help take City to the next level, particularly in Europe.

Southampton have a £6.8million option on Alderweireld as part of their loan deal but it's thought Atletico may well use a clause in the deal that stipulates they can essentially pay £1.5m to cancel that and then sell the player to the highest bidder.

That would leave Koeman sweating on his attempts to take the former Ajax defender on a full-time basis.

Southampton work to a tight budget and know they'd be facing an uphill struggle in striking a deal with Atletico this summer if bigger clubs enter the race.

Alderweireld signed for Atletico from Ajax for a fee of £6.2 million in 2013, and the Spanish club are keen to recoup as much of that fee as possible.
