Death island tour: It was business as usual at Cilicap where tourists (pictured) waited for a boat to tour Nusakambangan Island where Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are due to be executed 

Point of no return: Sodong port on Nusakambangan Island is the entry gate to the prison complex  which houses drug smugglers, murderers and convicted Islamic terrorists in six correctional facilities including Batu Penjara, built by the Dutch in 1925, and the final destination of the Bali 9 duo

Prison island: Despite white beaches and  tropical scenery Nusakambangan Island (above) off the southern tip of central Java, Indonesia, has been a prison island since 1905, with six operational facilities set in dense rain forest and rubber plantations. Condemned men are shot on the beach or in the 'grove' in the island's centre

The police chief at the major port to the island, Cilicap police commander Ulung Sampurna Jaya, also confirmed the firing squad was 'ready at any time of instruction' to carry out the execution.

'We are only waiting of the instruction. We have already secured the entire area of Cilacap with our troops,' he said.

'We are preparing Batu Penitentiary to isolate the duo inmates, we still await from Kerobokan Bali, when they are ready,' Yuspahruddin said to journalists.

Condemned men: Myuran Sukumaran (pictured in a Bali holding cell) are desperately waiting for a reprieve from their scheduled transfer to central Java and execution. The pair has put their faith in lawyer Dr Todung Lubis who will challenge their failed clemency bid in a Jakarta court next Tuesday

Prison boat: Police patrol the dock by the Pengayoman-IV, which is owned and operated by the Nusakambangan prison complex in central Java and is used to ferry  inmates, including condemned prisoners such as Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, to the island to meet their final fate

This was despite the fact the execution has been delayed ahead of a court hearing next Tuesday in Jakarta to challenge Indonesian president Joko Widodo's rejection of the two Australian's application for clemency.

Chan and  Sukumaran were sentenced to death in February 2006, less than a year after being arrested attempting to smuggle from Indonesia to Australia 8.3kg of heroin valued at around $4 million strapped to the bodies of the young Australians who became known as the 'Bali 9'.

The drug operation ringleaders appealed  to the newly elected Indonesian president Widodo last year to have their death sentences commuted to life, but he refused. An appeal against his decision is due to be heard on Tuesday.

Meanwhile police chief Jaya said he had increased security patrols in Nusakambangan waters ahead of Chan and Sukumaran's transfer from Bali's Kerobokan jail, reports the Jakarta Post.

'We are conducting security patrols more intensively, especially in Nusakambangan waters,' he said. 'We are securing all Nusakambangan entrance points so there will be no unauthorized people entering the island.'

The prisons boss, Ahmad Yuspahruddin, said his team had checked and examined the entire preparation for the executions this week.

'We are preparing Batu Penitentiary to isolate the Bali Nine duo inmates,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We still await news from Kerobokan Jail in Bali, when they are ready.'
