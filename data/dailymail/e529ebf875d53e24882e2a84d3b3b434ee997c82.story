Clark had told the Blackpool Gazette: 'If anyone can let us know where he is, send me a letter and we will go from there.

'I don’t know where he is, I haven’t seen him for more than two weeks. He’s been asked to report into training and has been asked to play in games and he hasn’t been seen.

'For whatever reason Nile appears to be back in London but we don’t know why.

'We’ve told him of the training schedule but he’s decided that’s not in his plans.

The 23-year-old recently described his move to Blackpool as his 'last chance' after both Newcastle and Swindon terminated his contracts following a number of off-field incidents.

Ranger had made a bright start to his career at the Championship club, scoring two goals in nine appearances, but was reportedly upset with being left out of the squad of his side's 1-0 victory against Birmingham on December 6.

Speaking after the move in August, Ranger said: 'This isn’t a good chance for me – it’s my last chance, so I have to grab it with both hands.

'This is my actual last chance – I’ve had more lives than a cat.'
