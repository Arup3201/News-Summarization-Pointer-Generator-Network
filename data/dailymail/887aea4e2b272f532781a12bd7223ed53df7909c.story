Devon and Cornwall Police said the victim was standing in the foyer of the bank about to withdraw cash from the machine when an unknown man approached her.

‘She complied with his demands and drew out the cash and gave it to him. He asked her to wait in the foyer for two minutes before leaving and he then made off.’

The man is described by police as white, in his early 20s, 6ft tall, of scrawny build with dark brown hair, dark eyes and dark eyebrows. He was wearing a black raincoat with the hood up.
