Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell is on trial accused of murdering and sexually assaulting a baby for about 15 hours in March last year, including inflicting third-degree burns and bruises

A 27-year-old man who faces charges of murdering and sexually assaulting a baby, has told a Perth court that he 'never would have harmed' the child because he 'was looking after him'.

Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell is on trial accused of abusing the baby for about 15 hours in March last year, including inflicting third-degree burns and bruises.

On Thursday, Mr Bell, denied burning the child and said that he did not recall the baby having any injuries before he took him from Broome.

While testifying, Mr Bell told West Australian Supreme Court the bruises on the baby's body were presumably caused when he fell out of a moving car.

Mr Bell, who knew the child's mother, said he panicked and was upset.

'I was crying because he had fallen out of the car,' Bell testified.

He told the court the boy was hurt so he cradled him against his chest, but did not inspect the 10-month-old baby for injuries or take him to a hospital.

'I just tried to comfort him, that's all,' he said.

'I didn't think he was that bad.'

Mr Bell said the babies burns came from touching hot rocks while at a swimming spot.

He said while under the water for 20 seconds he felt a kick to his leg, and when he came up, he found the baby head-first in the water.

Water came out of the child's mouth and Mr Bell, who was in shock, performed CPR until the ambulance arrived, the court heard.

'It was like he was choking,' Bell said.'I pumped on his chest a couple of times.'

'He just wouldn't breathe.'

'It just happened so fast,' he repeatedly said.

Mr Bell told the court he did not think the mother took care of her baby and admitted the pair argued the evening before the baby died.

He said the altercation began when the woman humiliated and slapped him.

'I may have assaulted her. I'm not 100 per cent sure,' he said.

Mr Bell said he tore off her clothes but denies trying to run her over in his car.

'I wanted to humiliate her,' he testified.

The judge-alone trial continues.
