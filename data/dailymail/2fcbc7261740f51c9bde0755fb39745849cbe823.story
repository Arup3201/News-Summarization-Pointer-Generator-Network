A British daredevil missing  in the Swiss Alps for almost four days was rescued yesterday after he built an SOS sign out of branches by his mountain cave.

Daniel Hunt, 33, was taking part in the extreme sport of speed-flying – a combination of paragliding and skiing – when he got into difficulty shortly after taking off from an 11,333ft-high pass on Saturday morning.

He was forced to make an emergency landing at the bottom of a waterfall in a gorge that was 260ft deep and just 40ft wide.

Daniel Hunt was visibly relieved after finally being rescued from the remote part of a gorge following a three-day hunt

Friends raised the alarm when Mr Hunt,
who runs an organic food shop in West London, failed to arrive at the 
agreed landing site in the Lauterbrunnen Valley near the city of Bern.

Amid sub-zero conditions, Swiss army and mountain rescue services dispatched helicopters and scrambled search teams .

With only hours before bad weather was
due to overwhelm the remote mountain, Mr Hunt, of Shepherds Bush, was 
finally spotted at 12.20pm, waving and shouting next to his SOS sign.

His best friend Nadeem Al-Khafaji climbed down into the gorge and helped to winch him to safety in a private helicopter.

Found: Daniel Hunt, 33, from Shepherd's Bush in west London, disappeared on Saturday

Exhausted but on his feet, Mr Hunt was
immediately taken to hospital for medical tests after enduring three 
nights in freezing conditions.

He is thought to have suffered a 
suspected broken ankle but no other serious injury.

Last night he issued a brief statement
thanking everyone who had helped to find him.

It read: ‘I am so 
grateful, touched and humbled by all the help. Thank you from the bottom
of my heart.’

A picture was also released showing him dishevelled but smiling and holding his arms aloft in triumph.

Mr Al-Khafaji added: ‘He is good spirits and is overwhelmingly fine.’

Another close friend and fellow 
adventurer, Pedro Pimentel, said: ‘This is the best day of my life.

'I 
was trying to be positive but also fearing the worst.’

Mr Hunt’s long-term girlfriend Nadia 
Niznanska, 28, said: ‘We are all ecstatic, relieved and overjoyed. The 
nightmare is finally over.

'I never stopped believing he was OK. He’s 
such a trouper.’

Kara De Los Reyes, whose boyfriend Tim
Good was with Mr Hunt on the speed-flying trip, said: ‘I have been 
jumping around and crying – we cannot believe it.’

Mr Hunt's friends launched an appeal for donations to pay for an ongoing search 

Last night, as details of the dramatic
rescue began to emerge, a Swiss police spokesman said Mr Hunt was 
‘tired and exhausted’ following his ordeal, adding: ‘He was unlucky but 
ultimately very lucky.

‘He saw the search helicopters more 
than 15 times but was unable to make himself noticed by them. In the end
he used wood to spell SOS. And then he was found.’

Mr Hunt launched himself from the  
Jungfraujoch pass but became trapped in a gorge near the Trummelbach 
Falls, Europe’s largest subterranean waterfalls.

The falls carry 20,000 litres per 
second of ice-melt water from three of Switzerland’s most imposing 
mountains, the Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau, which are all more than 
13,000ft high.

The police spokesman said: ‘According 
to the first information from the man, he encountered difficulty... and 
he had to make an emergency landing in water in the Trummelbach.

'He was 
able to detach his fabric wing [part of his speed-flying equipment] and 
reach the water’s edge with the help of a branch from a tree.’

Speed flying involves skiing down a mountain until a skier picks up enough speed to take-off on an attached 'wing'

Pedro Pimentel, 33, who has taken part in extreme sports with Mr Hunt, said: 'It's quite surprising that he has gone missing, he is experienced, I think he could still be alive'

At one point Mr Hunt’s friends had to 
raise nearly £14,000 in an internet campaign after the adventurer’s 
insurance company refused to continue paying for helicopters.

The funds helped to pay for a dog 
team, canyoning experts and helicopter flights, while up to a dozen 
volunteer paragliders and mountaineers flew into the country to join the
search.

Last night Mr Hunt’s parents said they
were overwhelmed by the support from friends, family and others across 
the world.

A post on a Facebook page called Find Dan Hunt, set up to 
publicise the search, stated: ‘Dan is very well, in good spirits and 
extremely grateful for everyone’s contribution to his search and 
rescue.’
