Romanians are being arrested in London at seven times the rate of Britons, it was revealed yesterday.

Around 800 people from the Eastern European state were arrested in the capital last month, according to official figures.

Many of them are linked to a wave of cashpoint fraud which cost an estimated £40million in the first six months of this year alone.

Police say that for every 1,000 Romanians in London, 183 are arrested. This compares to 26 Britons per 1,000.

Police chiefs have been told to investigate the reasons behind the hugely disproportionate figures.

They are concerned that they could rise even higher when restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians living in Britain are lifted on January 1.

The Government is preparing for a ‘comprehensive’ review of how foreign national offenders are treated in the criminal justice system.

There are concerns that gaps in cross-border intelligence checks are allowing prolific and dangerous offenders to slip through the net.

The latest figures emerged at a summit about the threat posed by foreign criminals held at City Hall, in Central London.

Stephen Greenhalgh, the capital’s deputy mayor for policing, was told the Met has undertaken an in-depth study of overseas offenders.

It found that Romanians account for more than 11% of all foreign national offenders, despite making up just a tiny proportion of residents.

This placed the Eastern European nation at the top of a ‘league table’ of foreign suspects, followed by people from Poland, Lithuania, India and Nigeria.

The other five countries in the top 10 were Ireland, Portugal, Pakistan, Jamaica and Somalia.

Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, of the Met, admitted there is a ‘capability gap’ when it comes to tackling overseas offenders.

He said that ‘historically’ there has not been a ‘strong enough’ relationship between police and Home Office border staff.

There now needs to be a ‘concerted effort’ by both agencies, he added, to identify and kick out the most dangerous criminals operating on British soil.

Mr Rowley said: ‘By definition, much of the information that would help us deal with these people more effectively is held in their home country.

‘It is only if people are here a long time and develop a criminal history that this gap is equalised. There is a capability issue that needs to be closed.’

A Met study discovered that foreign national offenders are more likely to be cautioned and less likely to be prosecuted.

They are also arrested more often for low level offences such as ticket touting, begging and prostitution.

Senior officers are concerned that they often cannot get information about the criminal histories of European suspects while they are in custody.

They hope to reach an agreement with Poland, Lithuania and Romania by February for ‘fast time’ access their criminal databases.

Officers from Poland and Romania are already working in London in a bid to improve links between the countries.

Scotland Yard has scored some significant victories by deporting dangerous men in the face of lengthy court appeals, often on human rights grounds.

Among them was a serial knifepoint robber and sex offender sent back to Sierra Leone after 18 years in Britain. He was named as a suspect in 46 inquiries.

A violent Jamaican gangster with convictions for rape and armed robbery was deported using police intelligence and banned from the country for a decade.

Around 70,000 foreign nationals are arrested in London every year, about 28% of all criminal suspects taken into custody.

Intelligence analysts also estimate that a quarter of the most dangerous criminals are from overseas.

Speaking after the meeting, Mr Greenhalgh said: ‘The police have upped their game and there is now stronger enforcement against foreign national offenders.

‘Now we need to make sure the police get the intelligence from overseas partners so the prior convictions of all offenders are routinely available.

‘Foreign nationals who commit crime must be treated the same as British nationals. London is a global city but it must not be a soft touch for foreign criminals.’
