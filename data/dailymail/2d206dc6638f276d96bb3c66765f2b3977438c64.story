Well that didn't take long for Robert Pattinson to jump into bed with someone else.

Although the reality of him bed-hopping with a seductive female co-star is just for film Cosmopolis.

The Twilight hunk also shot scenes with Patricia McKenzie long before the Kristen Stewart and Rupert Sanders affair scandal broke, with K-Stew even accompanying him to the Cannes premiere.

Bed-hopping: Shirtless Robert Pattinson is seen in bed with female co-star Patricia McKenzie in Cosmpolis

In new stills from the David 
Cronenberg film, shirtless R-Patz can be seen writhing around in bed 
with McKenzie as she appears to straddle and dominate the scenario.

Canadian actress Patricia is best 
known for her role as Reena in TV series Charlie Jade, and as Jenn in 
Naked Josh. She has also performed onstage, notably in The Lion King and
Chicago.

Pattinson fans may be surprised to see him take on a bad boy character in the leading man role.

What would Kristen say? Rob is seen in a sex scene with a naked woman toting a gun

And the 25-year-old even strips off for his role as millionaire Eric Parker, sort of.

The illusion is that he appears naked, but the British star revealed he is a lot more prudish than that.

Speaking
to Us Weekly, Pattinson said: 'Five minutes before we filmed, David 
told me, "I want to see the bottom of your balls on the top of the 
frame."

'At the 
moment, I reminded myself that I would do anything for him. (But) I went
back to see him and told him that wouldn't happen.'

Ouch! In another scene the actor is seen shooting a bullet through his hand

In the trailer, Robert is seen 
mid-way through a romp with gun-wielding McKenzie, which will no 
doubt have his fans drooling for more. 

The actor is seen lying on his back as the femme fatale points a pistol onto his chest.

With only a laser light on him, R-Patz is seen with a bemused, but calm, look on his face as he stares up at her.

The action-packed sequence also shows
Parker shooting himself in the hand, indulging in a sexual encounter in the back of his limousine, and he also appears to stab someone in the face.

Sinister: Twilight fans are likely to be shocked at Pattinson's transformation

The character couldn't be further from 
the peaceful and loving Edward Cullen of the Twilight films, and fans 
will no doubt relish the change.

As well as his liaison with a woman in 
his car, the character is seen relieving himself by going to the 
toilet in his luxury vehicle, which is described in detail in the novel that the film is based on. 

Parker is travelling 
across the city to get a haircut, but the activities he encounters along
the way are clearly not so mundane as his goal.

Robert's character in Cosmopolis is in a personal and professional downward spiral during his 24 hour, ill-fated odyssey across New York.

The film also stars Paul Giamatti, Juliette Binoche, Samantha Morton and She's Out Of My League star Jay Burachel.

Colin Farrell was originally cast in the lead role but left due to scheduling difficulties.

The film is based on Don DeLillo's novel and filming took place in Toronto, wrapping in 2011.

Robert will now start promoting the film two days earlier than expected - after it was revealed today he is scheduled to appear on Jon Stewart's The Daily Show on Monday night.

It was initially reported that his first TV appearance since the scandal would be on Good Morning America on Wednesday - which is still due to go ahead.

A spokesman for the actor told The Hollywood Reporter: 'Robert Pattinson is confirmed to appear as a guest on The Daily Show this Monday, August 13, to promote his new movie.'

Pattinson is also believed to be attending the Big Apple premiere of Cosmopolis on Monday.

Meanwhile, Kristen is leaving Twilight far behind her too as she strips off for new film On The Road.
