Ordered out: John Kalymon, once known as Iwan Kalymon, will be forced to go to 'whichever country will take him'

A former Nazi living in America is facing deportation because of his role in World War II.

The immigration appeals panel dismissed the appeal ofÂ  John Kalymon of Troy, Michigan, who was ordered to be removed from the U.S. because of his involvement in the brutal persecution.

The Board of Immigration Appeals upheld an immigration judge's decision that John Kalymon of Troy, Michigan, served voluntarily as an armed member of the Nazi-sponsored Ukrainian Auxiliary Police and shot Jews.

Kalymon's lawyer, Elias Xenos, said he would next appeal to a federal court in Cincinnati.

Kalymon has said he did little more than guard streets and rooms in police stations in Lviv, which was part of Poland until 1939. He's now in poor health.

In January, U.S. Immigration Judge Elizabeth Hacker ordered Kalymon, now 90, to be deported to Germany, Ukraine, Poland or any other country that will take him.

Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said Kalymon and accomplices in the Ukrainian Police were indispensable participants in Nazi Germany's campaign to exterminate the Jews.

Mr Breuer said thousands of Jewish men, women and children were murdered in Lviv or rounded up and shipped to the Nazi death camp in Belzec or to Nazi forced labor camps, CNN news website reported.

In a news release last month, the Justice Department said Kalymon 'personally shot Jews while serving, killing at least one' and 'participated in violent anti-Jewish operations in which Jews were forcibly deported to be murdered in gas chambers and to serve as slave labourers.'

Eli Rosenbaum, head of the Justice Department's Nazi-hunting unit the case is one of more than a hundred prosecuted by the Department of Justice against wartime Nazi perpetrators.
