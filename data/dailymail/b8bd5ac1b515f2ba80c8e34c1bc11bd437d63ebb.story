When it comes to standing out from the crowd on the red carpet, 6ft Sigourney Weaver has always had a head start.

Team her height with timeless good looks and a stunning floor-length cobalt gown and it’s clear that, even at 63, few can equal her for eye-catching glamour.

Miss Weaver, with hair styled in a neat bob and carrying a small clutch bag, effortlessly matched the younger Hollywood stars – led by Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller – at the 67th annual Tony Awards in New York.

The star’s appearance was light years away
from the functional fatigues and shorn head she sported as Ripley, her 
most famous role, in the ‘Alien’ trilogy. 

The Avatar actress, whose trophy cabinet features one BAFTA and two Golden Globes, was not up for an award but the comedy Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike, in which she stars as Masha, was awarded best play.

Miss Weaver also presented the award for best revival of a play, which went to Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

But the overwhelming hit of the awards ceremony was Kinky Boots, the musical adaptation of the 2005 British comedy film, which picked up six trophies.

The wins included best musical, original score for its writer, 80s pop star Cyndi Lauper, and best leading man for actor Bill Porter.

The show, about a struggling shoe factory that turns to fetish wear to survive, beat hotly tipped British show, Matilda, for the top award.

But Matilda, which transferred to Broadway from London’s West End still came away with four prizes.

Writer Dennis Kelly won best book of a musical for the Royal Shakespeare Company co-produced show, which won a record seven Oliviers during its run in this country.

Gabriel Ebert won the best actor accolade for his role as Mr Wormwood and the four actresses who portrayed Matilda in the show also received a Tony for excellence in the theatre.

Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson, Cicely Tyson and Scarlett Johannson were among the stars at the awards night.

Actor Neil Patrick Harris hosted the show, which opened with a song and dance number from the Irish musical ‘One.’

In a rare feat, two women took home both directing prizes for the first time in 15 years – Diane Paulus for ‘Pippin’ and Pam McKinnon for the revival of ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf.’
