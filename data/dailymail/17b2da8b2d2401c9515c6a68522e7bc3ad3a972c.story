Taking action: Julie Gayet has filed a complaint against the photographer who snapped President Hollande outside her flat

The photographer who exposed Francois Hollande’s secret affair with an actress is potentially facing criminal charges following a complaint by the President’s lover.

Sebastien Valiela, a veteran media operator with high-powered contacts in France’s political establishment, is suspected of compromising the privacy of 41-year-old actress Julie Gayet.

Valiela, who took the photographs of Hollande meeting Ms Gayet is being questioned by police today as part of a criminal enquiry into the scandal.

‘He’s been taken in for questioning,’ said a police source, who said the BRDP, a specialist brigade which examines crimes against individuals, was leading the enquiry.

But the involvement of the police in what is now widely viewed as a matter of huge public interest is being viewed by many as an attack on press freedom.

Mr Hollande, 59, regularly met his younger lover without bodyguards in a Paris apartment rented by a woman linked to the Corsican mafia.

‘From the moment he was in the apartment his security detail left,’ said Mr Valiela, saying an attack on the Socialist head of state would have been easy.

Ms Gayet’s long relationship with Mr Hollande led to his former girlfriend, 49-year-old Valerie Trierweiler, losing her title as first lady of France after Mr Hollande announced their split in an 18 word statement.

Ms Trierweiler felt so humiliated by photos exposing the scandal that she smashed up furniture in the Elysee Palace before checking herself into hospital for eight days.

After Mr Valiela's photos of Hollande meeting Ms Gayet were published by French Closer, his partner Valerie Trierweiler was to shocked she was hospitalised

A court in Nanterre, the Paris suburb, has opened an enquiry into the publication of images showing Mr Hollande visiting his love nest on the back of a moped while wearing a crash helmet as a disguise.

Ms Gayet, who had continually denied having an affair with Mr Hollande – including on national TV and on the radio – is determined to see those who exposed it punished.

Her civil claim against Closer magazine, which first published the pictures, has seen her claiming the equivalent of just over 40,000 pounds in damages and interest.

The editor of a publication found guilty of invasion of privacy under criminal law faces a possible one year sentence and a fine of up to 40,000 pounds.

Mr Hollande said earlier this year that it would be unfair for the President, who has immunity from prosecution, to take legal action against someone else.
