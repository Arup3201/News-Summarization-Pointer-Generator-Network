When Paula Ross was a toddler she was forced to eat fruit like every other child - but it drove her bananas for more than 20 years.

Now aged 23 and after years of enduring a phobia to bananas she has finally conquered a childhood fear that saw her nauseous at the sight of one.

Her fear became so bad that she couldn't bear to be in the same room as the fruit and felt sick if she smelled one.

I beat my phobia: Paula Ross from Kilmarnock in Ayrshire, has overcome a lifelong fear of bananas

She suffered torment at school as bullies chased her round the playground brandishing bananas.

But now after a programme of hypnotherapy she is regularly eating them.

Paula said: 'It is a ridiculous fear, but it is something I have had since I can remember.

'People used to chase me round the playground at school with banana peels and everyone used to laugh at me. They thought it was hilarious.

'I couldn't even stand to be in the same room as a banana but this therapy has changed my life. It is absolutely fantastic.'

Fighting phobia: Paula Ross is a keen Taekwondo competitor and says therapy helped her fight her fears

Paula, of Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, is not easily scared and even competes in martial art Taekwondo in her spare time.

Despite taking on some of Scotland's toughest competitors, the Scot still had real problems with her fruit fear, until she decided to seek help.

From
fear of visiting the dentist to being scared of spiders and snakes, 
most people have a phobia of something. Here though we present some of 
the oddest...

Ephebophobia - Fear of youths

Coulrophobia - Fear of clowns

Arachibutyrophobia - Fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of your mouth

Gymnophobia - Fear of nudity

Pentheraphobia - Fear of your mother-in-law

Deipnophobia - Fear of dinner conversation

Taphophobia - Fear of being buried alive

Pteronophobia - Fear of being tickled with feathers

Automatonophobia - Fear of a ventriloquistâ€™s dummy

Triskaidekaphobia - Fear of the number 13

She was cured using a specialist psychotherapy technique called Neuro-linguistic programming.

The treatment involves a therapist talking to the patient to teach them how to disassociate bad memories from certain objects and replace them with positive ones.

Paula, who will soon start a bioscience course at university with the hope of become a biology teacher, said: 'I couldn't believe it at the end of the session. I was handed a banana and that was that.

'I can go for lunch with my friends and I don't have to worry about being around if they have a banana. I am forever grateful.'

Her therapist John Bruce, who works for Epilepsy Connections in Paisley, Renfrewshire, said: 'It is a strange phobia to have. Before I spoke to Paula I had no idea you could have a phobia of a banana.

'I got her to imagine she was holding a banana and imagine the feelings she would normally be experiencing.

'Then I took her mind back to a time when she didn't have the phobia and taught her to associate those calm, happy feelings with bananas.

'I have never done anything like that before so it was fun to go through with her and I am glad she is doing so well.'
