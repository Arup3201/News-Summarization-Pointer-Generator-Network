Controversial football commentator Brian Taylor stood down from commentating Sunday's AFL match on radio after he made homophobic remarks on live television the night before.

Taylor told 3AW he would take the day off from the station's football call team program after referring to Geelong footballer Harry Taylor as a 'poofter' on Channel Seven on Saturday night.

He apologised during the half-time break of the television coverage but social media blew up calling for the outspoken broadcaster to be sacked.

This is the second time Brian Taylor has been slammed this year for homophobic remarks - he  also described his 3AW colleague Seb Costello's dress sense as 'gay' earlier in the season

'I've spoken to (3AW) management and they have chosen to give me a day off to collect my thoughts, so I'll take the opportunity to have a day off,' Taylor said.

'I made a blue, I apologised accordingly at the first opportunity to the Seven viewers where I made the blue.'

Taylor said he also apologised to Harry Taylor on Sunday.

3AW are recommending Taylor undergo 'quite severe counselling' but he will be back on radio next week.

'Even though these comments weren't made on 3AW... we do take this extremely seriously,' 3AW general manager Shane Healy said.

'We just want to let our listeners know that we'll be talking to Brian tomorrow and we'll be certainly commending to him some quite serious counselling.'

The comment came as footage was shown on Channel 7’s Saturday Night Footy panel show of Harry Taylor being chaired from the field last weekend after his 150th game when the popular Cat player did an unusual wave to the crowd.

‘I don’t know whether you guys down there can hear me or not. I am up here getting ready for the game and I’ve just seen that crap from Harry - he’s a big poofter,’ Taylor said.

‘You can’t be doing the old royal wave, next thing you’ll have your mum and dad out there.’

The former Richmond and Collingwood full-forward is known for being a long-time critic of players celebrating ‘minor’ milestones.

'In the pre-game show I said something that I regret, and I sincerely apologise in regard to Harry Taylor and anyone — and particularly Harry and any of his friends — that were offended by my remark,' he said.

'I apologise for that and I sincerely regret any harm that I have caused. So, sorry for that.'

This is the second time this year that Taylor has been slammed for making remarks that could be seen as homophobic.

‘I don’t want to offend his upbringing or his parents ... but he looks gay. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s just a look as sophisticated is a look, as daggy is a look. You look gay,’ he said when describing his 3AW colleague Seb Costello’s dress sense.

Some of the panellists on the show with Taylor laughed when he made the remarks but the fans are outraged

AFL fans have expressed they have had a gutful of his offensive comments and are calling on Channel 7 to fire the commentator with his remarks being described as disgraceful and shameful on Twitter.

‘Can someone please tell Brian Taylor he is a flog! He is the WORST commentator on tv ever! He needs to find a new job.’ Timothy Sim said

Kyran Wheatley ‏said the comment did not help the reputation of the game.

‘With Brian Taylor calling someone a big poofter on the Channel 7 pre game 'comedy' show, I can't imagine why no players have come out,’ Kyran Wheatley said.

While Dann de Wolff M.B.E. ‏ is capitalising on a possible job opportunity.

‘I really feel like Channel 7 are missing out by not having me as a football commentator. I could pretty easily replace Brian Taylor.’
