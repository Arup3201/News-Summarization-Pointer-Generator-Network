This undated file picture shows a former member of Japan's Aum Supreme Truth doomsday cult Makoto Hirata, 46, who was arrested in Tokyo on January 1, 2012 after almost 17 years on the run

He was one of Japan's most wanted men - a former member of a doomsday cult that staged deadly gas attacks on the Tokyo subway in 1995.

But it has emerged today that when Makoto Hirata turned himself in to authorities, after more than 16 years on the run, police didn't exactly rush to arrest him.

Incredibly, the 46-year-old was turned away when he tried to surrender at Tokyo police headquarters on New Year's Eve.

Hirata, a former Aum Shinri Kyo cult member, had been on the top of Japan's most wanted list since May 1995.

Yet an officer at the main entrance of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police HQ thought it was just a prank.

According to reports, he 
approached the officer around 11.35pm Saturday and said: 'I am Makoto 
Hirata. I am turning myself in.'

But the officer dismissed him as a
fake and urged Hirata to go to a local police station some 700m away, said the Asahi Shimbun, the Yomiuri Shimbun and the 
Mainichi Shimbun newspapers.

Hirata, who is wanted over a 1995 kidnapping, then told to the officer: 'I am Hirata on the special wanted list.'

The officer did not consult with his 
colleagues and again told Hirata to head to the Marunouchi police 
station, where he arrived 15 minutes later and was arrested, local media
said.

Hirata's hair was longer than in 
his photos from the mid-1990s, but his major facial features and body 
shape had not significantly changed, the Asahi said.

Hirata also claims to have called a
police hotline recently about his case, but was not taken seriously, 
national broadcaster NHK said.

He turned himself in after nearly 
17 years on the run for his alleged role in a plot to kidnap a man in 
1995 and conspiring with others to hold him in confinement and inject 
him with a chemical, causing him to die.

Hirata reportedly told 
investigators that he wanted to turn himself in after seeing the 
devastation caused by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

He said he could come forward 
because the statute of limitations had expired for a 1995 shooting of 
the chief of the National Police Agency.

Hirata reportedly told 
investigators that he wanted to avoid a wrongful arrest and claims to 
have no role in the shooting, despite earlier police suspicion that he 
was involved.

He told police he turned himself in because he wanted a sense of closure after being on the run for such a long time.

He was one of three former Aum Shinri Kyo cult members still at large after a series of crimes by the group.

The cult's founder, Shoko Asahara, whose real name is Chizuo Matsumoto, had his death sentence confirmed in 2006.

Simultaneous attacks with sarin nerve gas on five Tokyo subway trains during rush hour on March 20, 1995, killed 12 people and made thousands ill.

The attacks, with pictures of bodies lying across platforms and soldiers in gas masks sealing off subway stations, shattered the country's self-image as a haven of public safety.
