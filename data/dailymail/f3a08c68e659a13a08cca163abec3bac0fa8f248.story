Fears are growing that Britain's jails are becoming a hotbed of extremism after it was revealed today that nearly half the inmates of one top security prison are Muslim.

Some 42 per cent of those housed at Category A Whitemoor jail - and more than a quarter of those in London prisons - consider themselves to be of Islamic faith.

Experts now fear large numbers are being radicalised on the inside, where they say the spread of Jihadist ideas is rife.

A source at Cambridgeshire jail Whitemoor told the Sunday People: 'Whitemoor is now effectively run by Muslims, many of whom are Jihadis.'

A 2012 probe into the jail branded it a 'Taliban recruiting ground' and said inmates were offered protection if they converted to the religion.

Shadow Justice Minister Sadiq Khan claimed ministers are not doing enough to tackle the issue of radicalisation in prisons.

He said: 'In jails like Whitemoor, the Chief Inspector is on record warning of the risks of radicalisation. The Government needs to wake up to his problem before it is too late.'

Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan says too little is being done to tackle the problem at jails like Whitemoor

A source inside Whitemoor said the jail was 'effectively run' by its large Muslim population

Whitemoor houses terrorists including Nezar Hindawi, who was given a 45-year sentence for trying to bomb an airliner.

Also jailed there is Zia Al Haq, who has been locked up for 18 years in 2007 for offences including trying to bomb the London Underground.

The Ministry of Justice insists prison wardens are 'working hard to tackle extremist ideologies'.

A Prison Service spokesman said last night: 'Prisoners are held in establishments most suited to managing their individual needs and level of risk.

'The most recent independent inspection of HMP Whitemoor found it to be a safe environment and praised staff for their professionalism and dedicated care.'
