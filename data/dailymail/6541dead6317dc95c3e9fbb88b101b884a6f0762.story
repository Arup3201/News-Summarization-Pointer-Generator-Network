Swansea are set to open contract talks with Ki Sung-Yueng as Aston Villa’s interest in the South Korea midfielder builds.

Villa and Sunderland are keen on the 25-year-old, whose current deal expires at the end of the forthcoming season.

But Swansea are keen to retain Ki and Sportsmail understands that negotiations over a new contract will take place ahead of the new season.

Ki has had a mixed spell in south Wales since joining from Celtic in a deal worth £5.5million in 2012.

It is understood that his signing was more the choice of the club than Michael Laudrup, who was manager at the time.

Irrespective, he occasionally impressed during his first season, before being sent out on loan in the last campaign where he excelled at Sunderland.

A fine World Cup has also increased demand, but Swansea manager Garry Monk wants to keep Ki at the Liberty Stadium.

Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said earlier this month that a long-term contract was on the club’s agenda.

‘Ideally, we would like to tie Ki up on a long-term contract,’ he said. ‘There’s no hiding from that.

‘Garry Monk has spoken to him already, but it’s important that they have another chat and we will decide on where we go after that.’

Meanwhile, Pablo Hernandez’s move to Qatari side Al Arabi has been delayed as the clubs continue to haggle over the transfer fee. The move is not thought to be in danger.
