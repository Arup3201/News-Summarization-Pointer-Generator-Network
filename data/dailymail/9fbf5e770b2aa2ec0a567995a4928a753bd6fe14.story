Distressing mistake: Nurses told Ira Driscoll's family that she had died - but the 80-year-old (pictured) was alive and well in a neighbouring bed

After getting a call telling him his 80-year-old mother was dying, Michael Driscoll rushed to the hospital to see her alive one more time.

But on arrival at Royal Glamorgan 
Hospital in Llantrisant, South Wales, the 51-year-old was devastated to 
learn that he was too late and his mother had passed away.

However, his despair soon turned to 
shock after learning that the elderly woman they were being shown wasnot his mother Ira, who was actually still alive - and 
lying in the neighbouring bed.

The mix-up was discovered by his wife
Andrea, also 51, who was taken behind the curtain to see the body first
as her husband composed himself.

She was initially horrified by the 
apparent dramatic change in her mother-in-law's appearance - before 
realising the nurses' mistake.

'I went in first to allow Michael a 
moment to gather his thoughts,' said Mrs Driscoll. 'A nurse walked me to
the bed with the curtains drawn and asked if I wanted her to come in 
with me, but I said I’d be fine.

'I went behind the curtain and 
straight away thought: "What on earth has happened to my poor 
mother-in-law?" Her face was swollen and puffy.

'But when I went up to the head of the bed and saw this lady had white hair - Ira’s was brown.

'I was in so much shock I started shouting hysterically: "This is not my mother-in-law!'''

Nurses then realised the mistake and took the aghast pair to see their elderly relative, who was alive in the neighbouring bed.

Health chiefs yesterday apologised for causing the family distress with their mistake.

The couple say that visiting the elder Mrs Driscoll in the weeks after the January incident were 'difficult and traumatic'.

Her daughter-in-law, a social services worker, said: 'Luckily she slept through it all. We were very relieved to see her alive.'

Mrs Driscoll died a month later, a day before her 81st birthday.

The couple, from Pontypridd, South Wales, are now claiming compensation from Cwm Taf Health Board for the distress they suffered.

A board spokesman said: 'Whilst we can confirm we have expressed our sincere apologies to Mr and Mrs Driscoll for this mistake, we cannot divulge any particulars of the case due to the legal complexities involved.'
