A classmate of the grandson of Texas multimillionaire T. Boone Pickens has been sentenced to 10 years’ probation as part of a plea deal for giving the 21-year-old student the heroin that claimed his life.

Brennan Trainor Rodriguez, 23, pleaded guilty on Monday to delivery of a controlled substance in the January 2013 death of Ty Pickens, according to  Tarrant County prosecutors.

Rodriguez injected the drug into 21-year-old Pickens' arm, causing his death, prosecutors said. He will serve four months in jail as part of the agreement at the Texas court.

Prosecutor Kevin Roussea told Dallas News in a statement: 'This agreement was reached after considering all the facts and consulting with the family. No outcome can give them back their son, but hopefully with this plea, they can at least begin to heal.'

Rodriguez was facing counts of tampering with evidence and manslaughter but these were dismissed as part of a plea deal.   

Ty's father, Thomas Boone Pickens III, is the industrialist's youngest son. T. Boone Pickens started his career at Phillips Petroleum before founding Mesa Petroleum in 1956.  

In April 2013, the Tarrant County Medical Examiner ruled Thomas Boone Pickens IV or Ty, as he was known, died of acute heroin intoxication.

Another student allegedly found the grandson of the wealthy oil and gas titan at Rodriguez's off-campus apartment on the morning of January 29, 2013. 

The unidentified student said he wouldn't wake up and that he had probably been dead for several hours. It was later revealed that Rodriguez's cousin drove an unconscious Pickens to Baylor All Saints Hospital. 

Pickens was a junior at Texas Christian University where he was majoring in strategic communications.

Ty's multimillionaire grandfather T. Boone Pickens, who has five children and 12 grandchildren, lives in an opulent mansion in the exclusive suburb of Preston Hollow, Dallas

Ty's grandfather, who has five children and 12 grandchildren, lives in an opulent mansion in the exclusive suburb of Preston Hollow, Dallas where neighbors include former president George W. Bush, many of the Dallas Cowboys and George Michael. Homes can cost as much as $40 million.

The wealthy industrialist, who is worth an estimated $950 million, also owns the Mesa Vista, a property worth around $35million set in 68,000 acres in Roberts County, Texas.

The multimillionaire has his own Gulfstream jet which he parks at his private airport in Pampa, Texas and fuels up to take him to Oklahoma State football games.

He has also been actively involved in national politics.

He was one of the leading opponents against Democrat Sen. John Kerry's bid to unseat President George W. Bush from the White House in 2004.

Now, after a career in the oil industry, he champions a plan to get America to use fewer fossil fuels by promoting alternative energy such as wind, solar and natural gas.

He plans to build the world's largest wind farm in Texas to champion his idea. 

T Boone Pickens' luxurious Alva Court estate in Preston Hollow was on the market in 2013 for $7m
