Property developers using heavy machinery tore down a irreplaceable 4,000-year-old pyramid near Peru's capital of Lima.

Rafael Varon, deputy minister of cultural patrimony, told reporters the destruction occurred over the weekend at the 20 foot tall ruins of El Paraiso, a few miles north of Lima. 

His agency has lodged criminal complaints against companies Alisol and Provelanz for the weekend's damage and has moved to seize the equipment used.

Property developers have reportedly destroyed part of the ruins at El Paraiso Peru

No-one was available for comment at either company.

Peru's tourism ministry says El Paraiso was built some 4,000 years ago and was a religious and administrative center, long before the rise of the Inca culture encountered by the Spanish conquerors. 

Marco Guilen, director of an excavation project at El Paraiso, said the people who tore down the pyramid 'have committed irreparable damage to a page of Peruvian history.'

Experts have said that the destruction has caused 'irreparable damage to a page of Peruvian history'

'We are not going to be able to know in what ways it was constructed, what materials were used in it and how the society in that part of the pyramid behaved.'

Varon said people apparently working for the two companies tore down one pyramid and tried to destroy three others, but were stopped by witnesses. 

Mayor Freddy Ternero from the town where the ruins are located, San Martin de Porres, said the pyramids were located in agricultural fields and were not guarded, though he said the Minister of the Interior sent police to protect it after the incident.
