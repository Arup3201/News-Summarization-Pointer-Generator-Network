When Daniella Monteith came around after blacking out at Plaistow tube station she was initially worried that a family history of neurological illness had caught up with her.

Her first thought was to see a doctor and get a check up.

A week on from the black out in November 2011, still concerned about her family medical history, she called British Transport Police and asked them to review CCTV footage of her fall so that she had more details of what had happened.

Justice: Daniella Monteith, left, said that she is glad that 'justice has been served' after Michael Ayoade, pictured in CCTV footage from his November 2012 attack on a teenager, was jailed for four years today

It was only when officers watched a video of what happened that teacher Daniella was made aware that she had been the victim of a random and savage attack.

Unbeknown to Daniella, she had been viciously punched in the side of the head by Michael Ayoade in an unprovoked assault.

Transport police said that they'd never seen anything like the incident before.

Miss Monteith, who was a third year political science student at the time, had a broken tooth and pain and swelling in her jaw. But Daniella wasn't alone.

A second 16-year-old girl was also knocked unconscious in an almost identical attack on the street outside the same station a year later.

She was left with broken teeth and a split lip.

After that assault police released CCTV footage of the shocking assault and Ayoade was arrested after a tip off from a member of the public who recognised his face on the clip.

Brutal: As well as the attack on Daniella Monteith, Ayoade also attacked a 16-year-old girl in Plaistow. He is pictured on CCTV footage running up behind her

Vicious: Ayoade throws a punch at his 16-year-old victim outside Plaistow tube station

He later admitted the two attacks.

Yesterday, cannabis smoking Ayoade was jailed for four years at Inner London Crown Court.

Although he admitted two counts of Actual Bodily Harm, Ayoade originally told police his teenage victim had ‘started it’ by making him ‘feel like a pauper with her facial gestures.’

In interview, he told officers he could not cope with ‘taking an insult from a little person like that.’

Prosecutor Joel Smith told the court: 'What is most shocking about these offences is that they seem to flare up from nothing.

'He is a danger to the public and in particular women.'

Miss Monteith, currently working as an English teacher in China, told the Evening Standard after the sentencing: 'It (the sentence) won't make me feel any safer going back to England, but I'm happy justice has been served.'

Horrific: The 16-year-old, who cannot be named because of her age, is thrown to the ground following the assault

She added that she was lucky to be alive after the attack saying: People die from blows to the head all the time.

'Both myself and the other young lady are lucky to be alive.'

It also emerged today that this is the third time the thug has been jailed for attacks on innocent members of the public.

In October 2009 he received a 90 day sentence for an attack on a woman in the street after spitting on her shoe.

When she said it was disgusting he followed her, demanded an apology then punched her in the face.

And just two months later in December 2009 he was locked up for three months for punching a man in the face as he talked on his mobile phone.

The court had heard that Ayoade, who smoked up to ten cannabis joints a day, told his victim afterwards: 'I’m sorry, that wasn’t meant for you.'

When he was arrested he told police: 'Shut up p***** or I’ll punch you in the head.'

Gillian Frost, defending Nigerian-born Ayoade, said her client accepted his behaviour was ‘shocking’ and added his use of cannabis could have possibly added to his attitude.

Jailing him at Inner London Crown 
Court Judge Roger Chapple said he was ‘deeply troubled’ by Ayoade’s lack
of explanation for his actions.

In
police interview the thug told officers he had drunk a cup of vodka and
smoked three or four spliffs before carrying out the attack on the 
teenage girl.

He was 
examined by medical experts but they were unable to find any mental 
health problems. One doctor said he presented a ‘high risk to others and
particularly women.’

Injured: The girl was knocked unconscious in the shocking attack and left with broken teeth and a split lip

Stricken: Ayoade is seen running off at the top of the shot as his victim lies unconscious on the pavement in Plaistow, east London, following the attack

The judge agreed and told him: 'I am satisfied it is my job to do what I can to offer the public a measure of protection from you.”

He said the CCTV images were worth ‘many thousands of words’ and captured ‘graphically the shocking violence of the attack.’

He told the defendant he was using his powers to increase the sentence to the maximum four years, as well as adding an extra year on to his licence period.

He said: 'These are the sorts of attack which causes the public, on whose behalf I must sentence, an ever greater concern, a fear for their own safety when out, even during the hours of daylight.

'The sentence must be a deterrent to you and others. I must reflect that public concern for offences as violent as this and the public must be protected from you.'
