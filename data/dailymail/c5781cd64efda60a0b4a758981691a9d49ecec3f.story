If you’re planning to enjoy the great outdoors this weekend, better pack a brolly.

Rain looks set to sweep in over much of the country, giving holidaymakers a good dose of  traditional British weather.

Many areas will begin to feel much more autumnal, with temperatures in some parts of the North falling to single figures.

Rain looks set to sweep in over much of the country this weekend

Last night rain swept in over the North West and will continue today across the South East.

Tomorrow, a second band of rain will arrive, with heavy downpours expected in the North. 

But by Sunday the rain will begin to lift, giving way to drier weather moving up from the South.

And by Thursday and Friday temperatures could even reach 25C (77F) – above the 21C (70F) average for this time of year – just in time for the Bank Holiday.

Meteogroup forecaster Tom Obler said: ‘There will be rain today and tomorrow because an area of low pressure is moving in.

‘It will come in from Ireland before hitting the North and then the Southern and Central areas.

‘It’s fairly normal for this time of year. There will be a few days when it will feel a bit autumnal but next week we will see some warmer weather, especially in the South.’

Yesterday, London and the east of England enjoyed warm, humid weather and temperature highs of up to 25C.

But in Wales and the Western parts of England, there were already outbreaks of rain in the afternoon and evening.

Today’s cooler weather marks a strong contrast with July’s record-breaking heatwave, when temperatures soared past 30C (86F).
