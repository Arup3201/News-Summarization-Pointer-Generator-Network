President Obama and the First Family have landed in Hawaii tonight for a 17-day holiday together.

The family flew overnight in Air Force one, direct from Maryland to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. They are not expected to return to  Washington D.C. until January 4.

'On Friday, December 19, President Obama and the First Family will travel to Honolulu, Hawai’i. The arrival of Air Force One is open to pre-credentialed media and closed to the public,' the White House said in a statement.

'The President and First Family do not have any scheduled public events during their time in Hawai’i.'

Let the (expensive) fun begin: The Obamas are not expected back in the White House until early January - and plan on making the most of a chance to sleep in

Family time: Obama gave a wave as he made his way down from Air Force One after the lengthy flight. The family will stay in Kailua

It is not yet known exactly where the Obamas are staying this year, though it will be somewhere in Kailua on Oahu island, where they have stayed for the past three years.

During their year-end trips to the Hawaiian islands the Obamas typically lounge around their rental home, venturing out only on occasion for  shaved ice and dinner with their friends. First Lady Michelle Obama revealed on Monday that it's her Christmas wish to spend this year's holiday sleeping in late. 

The Obamas, including dogs Bo and more recently Sunny, have spent every Christmas since Barack was elected to president visiting the his birth place, Honolulu, which is coincidentally located in the beautiful Hawaiian islands. 

In addition to culinary excursions the president generally spends his time on the golf course or working out at a local Marine Corps base.

He and the first lady usually make a special trip to the base to to wish the troops stationed there a Merry Christmas and to thank them for their service, as well.

Last year the Obama family also went on two hikes, two beach trips, a snorkeling expedition and visited the Honolulu zoo during their 17-day trip.

Their six previous trips have lasted between two and two and a half weeks and cost taxpayers roughly $4 million, government watchdogs have estimated, even with the Obamas paying for their own accommodations, which cost them $56,000 in 2013.

Taxpayers picked up the tab for as at least seven other homes in the area that Secret Service and White House staff stayed in, however.

A 2012 trip cost even more - $7 million - Watchdog.org found, after the president accompanied his family to Honolulu, Hawaii, for five days, then rushed back to Washington to help negotiate a deal to keep the country from falling off the 'fiscal cliff.'

After spending several days at the White House, Obama then returned to Hawaii to pick up his family and finish out his vacation.  

Earlier this year the president's two-week vacation to Martha's Vineyard was interrupted by a series of domestic and international crises and the president ended up having to work on many days set aside for relaxation on the Massachusetts island.

He also returned to Washington, D.C. for two days during that getaway, without his wife, for meetings at the White House. 

This year's winter vacation promises to be much less stressful, as Congress has already approved a $1.1 trillion appropriations bill to fund the government through the end of this fiscal year.

The first lady said on Monday that she's looking forward to getting a good night's sleep while on her upcoming holiday.

Obama was at the Washington, D.C. medical center to read children the classic Christmas tale Twas the Night Before Christmas and to answer their questions on Monday when a patient asked her what she wanted this year, according to CBS News.

'I don’t really have a long wish list for Christmas, because I pretty much have everything I need,' she responded.

'I just want everybody to be happy, and I want to sleep in. That’s what I want for Christmas. I want to sleep late. Maybe I’ll get that,' she continued. 

After the first lady's initial answer another child inquired as to whether she had Christmas-themed sleepwear.

'Maybe that’s what I should put on my Christmas list,' Mrs. Obama said told the group that had gathered to listen to her read at Children’s National Health System hospital.

'OK, Mr. President, if you’re watching, I think we could use some Christmas pajamas. That’s a good idea,' she said.

Earlier that day her husband had admitted that he struggles with buying her gifts she'll like - particularly clothes - while talking to radio and TV personality Ryan Seacrest

'Michelle is hard to shop for,' he told the American Idol host during a radio interview that was taped Friday but aired on Monday.

'She's very fashionable and she looks good,,' he said, per USA Today. 'So I'm worried about buying her clothes because she'll, on Christmas Day, look at it and say, "That's really sweet, honey,"  and peck me on the cheek -- and I never see her wear what I bought.'

President Obama has finished the year on a memorable note - by only answering questions from female reporters at the final press conference of 2014.

In a presidential first, he called upon eight women in the last press meeting of the year and fielded questions about Cuba policy, the Sony hack and the state of race relations in the U.S.

Reading the reporters' names from a pre-prepared list, he called upon Carrie Budoff Brown from Politico, Cheryl Bolen from Bloomberg, Julie Pace from Associated Press, Lesley Clark of McClatchy, Roberta Rampton from Reuters, Colleen M. Nelson of the Wall Street Journal and Juliet Eilperin from the Washington Post.

Although he had said Eilperin would ask the last question, reporters continued to shout out more - as is tradition - and Obama clearly ignored a question from a male reporter about his new year's resolution.

Instead, he called upon one more woman - April Ryan of American Urban Radio.

A favorite past time of Obama both at home an on vacation in Hawaii is golfing.
