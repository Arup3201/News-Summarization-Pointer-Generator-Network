A 35-year-old graphic designer has taken a different approach in his search for love.

The self-employed man, who would only like to be known as Dan, has distributed 'Girlfriend Wanted' posters around Melbourne.

Dan - who describes himself as 'fit, sporty and educated' - is seeking an attractive woman aged between 23 to 35 who is 'genuine, caring and happy'.

But he looking for a serious relationship - 'no game players or time wasters'.

Dan told Daily Mail Australia he's been single for three months and decided to distribute his posters as other methods didn't work out.

'I had heard of other stories of people doing similar things so I thought "why not",' he said.

'I was not meeting anyone at bars and clubs. I had tried online and speed dating with mixed results and now I'm bored of it. It's also hard to meet people in general. Everyone is so busy with their face stuck to their phone. So I felt like I had to do something different. 

'Basically I like to take chances and just give things a go. Hoping there's a girl out there who has a similar outlook on life and also thinks "why not".'

So far Dan has received 60 emails from interested women from his poster but not one who ticks all the boxes.

'Some write just out of curiosity. Others are not what I'm asking for or are girls from interstate or overseas. Some write on behalf of friends. Some flake when it comes to meeting up,' he said.

'Girls appear to be wary of the poster. It's understandable but I also think of it as a bit of test. Is she willing to take a chance like me? Those that do, stand out to me and am thankful for it.'

And this is a method Dan has tried before.

'Did it late last year. I met one girl and we dated twice but she only wanted to be friends after that. So I decided to try a second time this year with the poster,' he said.

Although he admits he wants to 'settle down', Dan is still undecided about marriage and kids. 

'I'm wanting a relationship so one step at a time,' he said.
