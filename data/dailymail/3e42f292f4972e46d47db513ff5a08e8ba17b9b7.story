In a resort once wildly popular with British tourists, sun beds lie empty, restaurant tables are disturbed only by the wind and pristine beaches are eerily silent.

This time last year the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt was heaving with holidaymakers keen to enjoy the tail end of the summer, but fears over the escalating violence in the country are driving sun-seekers away.

The turmoil that has wracked Cairo has not affected the Red Sea destinations – such as Sharm El Sheikh, Taba and Dahab - and Egyptian military personnel have 
been stationed at the key holiday resort of Sharm El Sheikh as the the bodies mount in Cairo.

But the security presence at Sharm El 
Sheikh’s airport – the main point of arrival for visitors heading to the
region – has done little to reassure skittish tourists.

The escalating crisis in Egypt - where authorities today continued their crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its allies by arresting two more high-profile Islamist figures - has led to the deaths of more than 850 people - including 70 policemen and soldiers.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) reports that soldiers have also been positioned at the entrance to the resort portion of Sharm El Sheikh, and at the exit to the resort area of Dahab.

Routine security checks are also being performed on entry into the airport, and police are carrying out vehicle checks in and around Sharm El Sheikh.

The more southerly Red Sea resort of Hurghada witnessed clashes linked to the political storm on 14 August – although in an area away from tourist resorts. One man was killed.

The FCO stresses that the situation in the Red Sea holiday spots remains stable.

'There
have been no violent protests in the South Sinai resorts during recent 
disturbances in Egypt,' a statement says. 'The resorts remain calm.'

The
FCO is also maintaining its stance that British holidaymakers are safe 
to travel to the Red Sea areas, even though other nations have altered 
their advice to citizens.

Germany has joined a growing band of concerned countries in warning against travel to the Red Sea resorts – joining the USA, Sweden and Finland in urging caution.

The FCO’s stance leaves British holidaymakers and travel agents in limbo.

Worried tourists who decide to cancel their trip cannot claim a refund from their operator because the government has not ruled against 'all but essential travel' to the Red Sea.

Equally, tour operators are concerned, because bookings have dropped significantly since the current crisis in the country – sparked by the removal of president Mohammed Morsi and his replacement by an interim military government on 3 July – began.

'Let’s face it, nobody wants to book a holiday and then have it cancelled at the last minute due to possible danger, because it then means that you’ve got a problem trying to find something to substitute, and, of course it’s likely to be rather more expensive,' Steve Pattenden – the owner of Double S Travel in Luton – has told Travel Trade Gazette.

'It is better for us as a travel agency to recommend somewhere other than Egypt until things start quietening down a bit.'

Adventure travel specialist Explore has gone further, cancelling all tours to Egypt for the rest of 2013.

The company has little choice – many of its itineraries focus on the history and culture of the country, and with the FCO currently advising against all but essential travel to most of Egypt, Explore has been left in a difficult position.

'The vast majority of clients were happy we have made the decision in good time for them to rearrange,” operations director John Telfer told Travelmole.

'Clients want some certainty – which is one of the reasons that we need to make the decision about cancellation about three months in advance.

'Cancelling until the end of December is a clean psychological break – it gets rid of Christmas and the New Year. I’m very happy with the decision we’ve made.'
