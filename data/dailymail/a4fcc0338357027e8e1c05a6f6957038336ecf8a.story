A Texas man faces felony charges after authorities say he routinely beat his 2-year-old step-daughter, and in one case last month beat her so badly that it caused the little girl to go blind.

Additionally, the girl's mother, Nancy 
Esmeralda Colomo-Gonzalez, also faces charges for allowing her husband to beat the girl and not reporting the alleged abuse to authorities.

Authorities first learned of the alleged abuse on December 12, when Colomo-Gonzalez rushed her daughter, Yenitze Reyes, to the hospital with head injuries.

During an examination of the girl, doctors discovered that she had suffered a skull fracture, hemorrhaging, non-accidental traumatic brain injury and had gone blind as a result of her injuries.

Doctors also noticed that the girl had a broken arm that was beginning to heal, which indicated to those treating the girl that she had been abused in the past.Â 

Investigators began questioning the girl's step-father, 26-year-old Angel Martinez, who eventually admitted that he'd rocked 'the baby too hard' when he was trying to get her to fall asleep, according to court documents first obtained by Houston's KTRK.

As the interview with investigators continued, Martinez admitted that he had shaken the baby in the past, including once in September, which caused the toddler to go into seizures and vomiting.

According to Martinez, Colomo-Gonzalez took the girl to the hospital but lied to doctors about what had happened.

In another instance, Martinez told authorities that in October he grabbed the girl by her arm and swung her away from him, causing her arm to become swollen and red. Despite the apparent injury, nobody took the little girl to the hospital.

As for the December 12 incident, Martinez told authorities that he wasn't sure how he'd injured the girl, but told investigators that he threw the girl into the air and didn't catch her on the way down. He says the girl then hit her head on a wooden chair causing swelling and a large lump on the back of her head.

Martinez says he then panicked and tried to 'push the bump back into her head.' When that didn't work, the girl's mother drove her to the hospital.

That's Martinez's version of events, anyway.

Doctors say the girl's injuries aren't consistent with Martinez's story. According to the physicians who treated the girl, her injuries suggest that the girl had been slammed onto a hard surface. They also say that it appears as though someone must have pushed down on the girl's fractured skull, pushing bone fragments into her brain.

Martinez has been charged with felony injury to a child. The girl's mother has been charged with injury to a child by omission.
