Two teenagers, ages 13 and 14, from Spokane, Washington, are in custody after a horrifying sword attack fueled by 'blue pills' on the mother of one of the boys where they discussed eating her liver.

'The 14-year-old came up with the idea of, 'Hey, let's rip her open and 
eat her liver,' but it never happened,' Spokane County Sheriff's Deputy 
Craig Chamberlin told CNN on Friday.

While the woman was the younger boy's mother, it is alleged that the 14-year-old beat her with the handle of a sword. The rampage occurred after the suspects took some mystery blue pills.

Grotesque: Two friends ages 13 and 14 were arrested after police say they tried to kill the younger boy's mother with a sword and then eat her liver as she slept in her home along East Mission Avenue in Spokane, Washington

'I think that was their original plan,
to cut her open, but then they changed their minds,' Chamberlin added. 
The mother remained hospitalized with head injuries but in stable 
condition on Friday.

The 
teenagers were apprehended after the incident when they stole another 
parent's car, then burglarized and vandalized another home.

Spokane Valley deputies responding to an
assault call early Tuesday found the bloody woman on her bed; next to her were
two knives and a sword with a handle bent at 45-degree angle.

‘It doesn't sound like she remembered the
attack,’ Chamberlin said in a phone interview. The woman told deputies the
sword handle wasn't previously bent. It wasn't clear who called for help.

With no signs of forced entry into the
apartment in the 13000 block of East Mission Avenue in Spokane, deputies went
looking for the victim's 13-year-old son and a 14-year-old friend.

The other boy's father thought his son had
stayed with the 13-year-old, Chamberlin said. Then the man noticed his 2005 Dodge
Durango SUV and its keys were missing.

Deputies tracked the teens through a crime
spree that included breaking into a home and crashing the SUV into the side of
a mobile home. A K-9 dog eventually located them.

The injured woman's 13-year-old son told
deputies that his friend tried to kill the sleeping mother with a sword,
Chamberlin said.

The younger boy said he talked his friend into trying to kill his mother
because he had taken ‘blue pills.’ The spokesman said it was unclear what the pills were.

The boy said he would never have done
anything like that sober, Chamberlin said.

The son also told deputies his friend tried
to talk him into eating his mother's liver, the sheriff's spokesman said.

‘Your guess is as good as mine’ as to where
that idea came from, Chamberlin said.

The older boy admitted attempting to kill
his friend's mother and said they were going to leave town later, the spokesman
said. The older boy then asked for a lawyer.

There was no indication why the attack on
the mother ended when she woke up after being knocked on the head with the
sword.

Officers searching for the fugitives received a report of a hit-and-run
crash at 7800 East Alki Avenue, where the stolen Dodge struck a mobile home and
was left running while the teens took off, The Spokesman-Review reported.

A short time later, the boys were spotted breaking into a home in the area
of East Boone Avenue.

The interior of the targeted house was severely vandalized. Police say the
runaway teens caused about $2,000 worth of damage by hurling a hammer at the
walls and windows.

The pair were eventually discovered hiding near the residence and taken into
custody.

Both boys were booked into juvenile
detention for investigation of second-degree assault, taking a motor vehicle
without permission, burglary, malicious mischief and hit and run.

Public defenders have been pointed for both
teens, who were ordered held without bail at an initial court appearance
Tuesday, Chamberlin said.
