This is the horrifying moment a mechanical digger narrowly missed busy workers as it plummeted more than 30 metres to the ground.

The 17-tonne yellow digger was being lifted out of a hole in Santiago, Chile, when a cable snapped causing the metal machine to drop suddenly.  

Workers are demanding higher safety standards after one member of staff had just seconds to run out of its way.

The footage shows debris continuing to crash on the floor as workers shout to the men at the top of the hole.

They continue to whistle and inspect the damage as dust settles around them.  

Carlo Apodaca, a trade union worker, said it was only by chance none of the men were hit.

The 40-year-old said: 'The safety record round here is something we are no longer happy about and we want more action from management to avoid any similar mistakes like this.'

The footage was captured by two of the men, who are currently helping to build the future Plaza Egana metro station.

Local council officials responsible for checking safety said they will compile a report after receiving the complaints.

The Santiago Metro is South America's most extensive metro system with five lines, 108 stations, and 103 kilometres (64 miles) of track.
