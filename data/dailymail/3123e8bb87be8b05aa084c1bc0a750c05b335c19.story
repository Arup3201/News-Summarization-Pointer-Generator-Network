A woman who took part in a Pacific Northwest killing rampage fueled by white supremacist beliefs apologized for her actions, but not her views.

Holly Grigsby, 27, was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison with no chance for release.

She apologized in federal court to friends and relatives of the victims. Grigsby said she realized any explanation for her actions, such as her drug addiction, would come across as an excuse, 'or make it feel like I'm rationalizing my own insane behavior.'

Closure: Holly Grigsby, left, pictured in 2011 looking at her boyfriend, David 'Joey' Pedersen, has been sentenced to life in prison for her role in a Pacific Northwest killing spree that authorities say was part of a white supremacist plot

Bloody path: Grigsby and Pedersen were arrested in 2011 following the deaths of four people: Pedersen's father and stepmother in Everett, Washington, an Oregon teenager and a California man

But Grigsby expressed no regret for white supremacist beliefs, only the effect her crimes would have on their public perception.

'My actions have further damaged the reputation of a movement misunderstood,' she said 'I deeply regret this.

'Although I had nothing but the best of intentions, the bridge to Valhalla is not paved with good intentions" but with one's actions and heart,' she said, according to The Oregonian.

Grigsby and her boyfriend — David 'Joey' Pedersen — were arrested in 2011 following the deaths of four people: Pedersen's father and stepmother in Everett, Washington, an Oregon teenager and a California man.

Grigsby pleaded guilty in March to racketeering charges connected to the four killings, and the plea agreement called for a life sentence with no chance for release.

Joey Pedersen has pleaded guilty to two counts of carjacking resulting in death — one for the death of teenager Cody Myers on the Oregon coast and the other for the killing of Reginald Clark in Eureka, California.

Murdered family: Joey Pedersen's father, Red Pedersen (left), was shot in the back of the head, while his stepmother, Dee Dee (right), was slashed with dull knives and left to die from blood loss

Slain: Cody Myers, 19, was shot dead in Oregon when the couple thought he was Jewish, police said. They dumped his body in the woods and stole his car

He will be sentenced to life in prison at an August 4 hearing in federal court.

He previously pleaded guilty in Washington state court to murder in the slayings of David 'Red' Pedersen and Leslie 'Dee Dee' Pedersen and was sentenced to life in prison.

Dee Dee Pedersen's daughter, Lori Nemitz, told Grigsby in court that the murders were heinous and 'beyond cruel,' and made no sense since Grigsby had been welcomed into the home as family.

'I hugged you for God's sake,' Nemitz said.

Pedersen is the founder of a white supremacist prison gang, and he told Grigsby about his desire to start a revolution with a killing rampage targeting Jewish leaders.

Innocent bystander: The couple allegedly shot dead Reginald Clark, 53, in California after he offered them a ride, calling their victim a 'n***o degenerate'

It started on September 26, 2011, when Joey Pedersen shot his father in the back of the head while the elder Pedersen was driving, authorities said. Red Pedersen moved and moaned for at least 30 minutes before dying, prosecutors said.

Joey Pedersen believed that his father
 deserved to die because he had allegedy molested one of his daughters, 
rendering him a degenerate unworthy of the white race in his son's eyes,
 according to court documents.

'Animals are treated more humanely going to slaughter than your victims were.'

- Holly Perez, daughter of Red Pedersen

Pedersen and Grigsby returned to the house. Dee Dee Pedersen was bound with duct tape, slashed in the neck with a pair of dull knives and left to bleed to death.

'Animals are treated more humanely going to slaughter than your victims were,' said Holly Perez, the daughter of Red Pedersen and sister of Joey Pedersen.

Catherine Hix, who spoke on behalf of another daughter, called Grigsby a ' wicked, heartless viper' who slithered into their town driven by the desire to 'murder.'

The couple then drove Red Pedersen's vehicle south into Oregon, where they shot and killed 19-year-old Myers and stole his car, authorities said. They shot Myers, who was Christian, because his name sounded Jewish, according to court documents.

Grigsby would later tell police they did not want any witnesses, and they regarded Myers as a 'casualty of war.'

Pedersen and Grigsby then headed to Northern California, where Clark, a 53-year-old black man, was shot to death after he offered them a ride.

The persecutors wrote in court documents  cited by The Oregonian that the pair viewed Clark not only as a potential witness who had to be neutralized, but also as a 'Negro degenerate.'

Stopped: The couple was caught when a patrol officer saw them pulled over in October 2011 and asked if they needed help - before realizing the license plate was Cody Myers'

Caught: David Pedersen, who has a plaster on his cheek and a turtleneck to hide his tattoos, is handcuffed by California Highway Patrol Officers in October 2011

Grigsby and Pedersen were arrested October 5, 2011, outside Yuba City, California, when a police officer spotted them in Myers' car.  Grigsby told officers they were on their way to Sacramento to 'kill more Jews,' court documents said.

Prosecutors said Grigsby has been a white supremacist since her age 13, and did not fall under Pedersen's spell.

'She is unflinching in her beliefs,' assistant U.S. attorneys Jane Shoemaker and Hannah Horsley wrote in their sentencing memorandum.
