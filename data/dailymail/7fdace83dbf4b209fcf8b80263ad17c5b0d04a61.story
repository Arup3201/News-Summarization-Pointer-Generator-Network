The brother of a developer believed to have been held hostage for eight months has revealed he was threatened at gunpoint during his captivity.

Property tycoon Kevin McGeever, who vanished last summer, was found wandering barefoot on a rural road in the west of Ireland last week and looked like he had 'just been released from a concentration camp'.

His brother Brendan revealed his kidnappers repeatedly pushed a gun to his forehead and handed him notes warning him he had two more days to live.

Kevin McGeever, pictured with his partner Siobhan O'Callaghan, was discovered wandering barefoot after his eight-month ordeal

'They put a gun to his forehead one time and he said "do it now, do it now, I've made my peace with my God, I'm ready",' said Mr McGeever.

'And that happened quite a few times, that wasn't just the once.'

The developer, originally from Swinford in Co Mayo, had been living in a gated mansion in neighbouring county Galway when he disappeared last June.

The emaciated 68-year-old had a long beard, hair and finger nails when found and in a malnourished and dehydrated state near Ballinamore, Co Leitrim, on Tuesday, January 29.

He had lost several stone in weight and remains in hospital in Mullingar, Co Westmeath, where he has been interviewed by investigators.

Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan said the investigation is in its 'early days' and that gardai were considering out all of the aspects of the case.

Mr McGeever came face to face with his
brother who looked like 'a weather-beaten 90-year-old man who was just 
released from a concentration camp'.

The brother does not believe his tycoon sibling will ever recover from his ordeal and will remain in hospital for a long time.

Mr McGeever's home, 'Nirvana', in Craughwell, Galway. The property tycoon was kept in a darkened room and threatened several times, his brother claimed

'It's like asking someone who's just released from a concentration camp when do you think you'll be going back to work,' he said.

'You've no idea what's going on inside his body, but I would say a lot of organs in there have never experienced anything like this before.

'He's the fittest guy I know for his age. He used to be 14 stone, now he's about half of that.'

Mr McGeever said initially he was not worried about his brother's whereabouts as he often travelled around the world.

He made a fortune building houses, first in his native county and then abroad, including Dubai, and fronted KMM Commercial Properties.

But the family became concerned after two texts, one from England and one from Germany, were sent to his partner Siobhan O'Callaghan saying he was sorry he had to leave.

He was discovered carrying a torch and a mobile phone by a local woman as she drove near the Cavan-Leitrim border last week after he had been thrown from the back of a van.

It is understood he had been kept in a darkened room or container and survived on water and a daily sandwich which was given by his kidnappers, who kept their faces covered and only communicated by writing notes.

Mr McGeever said he has no idea why the developer was taken, but stressed his brother has rubbished claims he was abducted by the Russian mafia as 'nonsense'.

He maintained he has no reason not to believe his brother's story.

'When you look at somebody lying in a bed in the condition that he is in now, anybody that would have any doubts about anything would be totally convinced,' he added.

During the boom times in Ireland – the era of the so-called Celtic Tiger economy from 1995 to 2007 – Mr McGeever sold luxury homes in Dubai to wealthy clients, including some from Britain.

He also owned one of Ireland’s biggest mansions, a £3million property which was nicknamed Nirvana by locals in the west of the country and is surrounded by immaculate lawns.

He drove a Porsche and travelled in a helicopter which had his initials KMM emblazoned across it.
