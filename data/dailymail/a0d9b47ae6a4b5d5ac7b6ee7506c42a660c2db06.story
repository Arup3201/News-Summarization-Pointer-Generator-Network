If you've ever dreamed of working as a chef, this job advertisement may make you think twice.

FARMBloomington, in Bloomington, Indiana, listed an astonishing 44 requirements for a new line chef on the website Craigslist.

The demands include that candidates never call in sick, never complain and happily work several double shifts in a row without a day off.

While the position certainly isn't an easy one, with its long hours and low pay, this restaurant's long list of required skills makes it sound like a job in a real-life Hell's Kitchen. 

The advert: FARMbloomington placed this job advert for a new line chef on Craigslist with a rather long list of the duties involved - and this is only half of it

Describing its ideal applicant, the advert read: 'You always show up for work, even if you're sick as a dog. Let the chef see you're really sick and send you home.

'You are able to work double shifts for many days without days off.

'You never complain - especially about things the chef can't control like customer requests, the hours the restaurant is open, how busy or slow it is, etc.

'You cook your dishes exactly as the chef taught you, the same every time.'

On top of these demands, the posting adds that employees can only respond to the head chef with 'yes, chef!' or 'oui, chef!'.

Welcome to Hell's Kitchen: FARMbloomington said the advert was posted by a sous chef who didn't read it through properly but admitted it is company policy that managers decide whether staff are fit enough to work

It claims this 'is the only proper response in a traditional kitchen', adding: 'All questions to cooks will be phrased such that “Yes, chef!” is the correct and only response. If it sounds militaristic, that’s where it came from.'

General manager at FARMbloomington, Harry Shafer, said a sous chef put up the job posting without reading it thoroughly.

He told FoxNews.com: 'It was taken down as soon as we were aware of the negatives listed.  I promise that the ad does not reflect the kind of business we run.'

While the advert was only posted on Craigslist for a few minutes, FARMBloomington admitted that it is company policy that manages decide whether staff are unfit to work.

Mr Shafer continued: '"Sick" associates are most often just hungover, so it is our policy that the managers decide if they cannot work.'

But he added that FARMbloomington pays its hourly staff time-and-a-half if they work over 40 hours and they receive gift cards as bonuses. 

Mr Shafer said: 'Although we do run a tight ship and a very professional kitchen, I promise you our staff enjoys themselves while they are here (at least as much as someone can while working).'
