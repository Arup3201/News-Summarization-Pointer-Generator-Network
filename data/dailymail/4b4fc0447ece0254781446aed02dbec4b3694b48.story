England's first wild beavers for 800 years were last night released back onto a river in Devon, after passing vital health tests.

The animals were captured for a series of tests last month, after Natural England gave unprecedented permission for them to be allowed to live free near Ottery St Mary, east Devon.

Four adults and a juvenile were certified as free of disease, and will rejoin four young kits which had remained on the River Otter.

Born free: England's first wild beavers (pictured paddling away after being released) for 800 years were last night released back onto the River Otter in Devon, after passing vital health tests

Devon Wildlife Trust officials, who will monitor the animals in a five-year pilot project, last night said they were delighted the beavers were back on the river.

Ministers had initially wanted the remarkable animals to be rounded up and put in a zoo or even culled after they were first spotted in late 2013.

But government agency Natural England has decided they will instead be allowed to stay in the wild in the first project of its kind.

Devon Wildlife Trust’s Peter Burgess said last night: ‘Today’s re-release means that these beavers are back where they belong, in the wild on the River Otter.

‘We’re delighted and relieved that they’ve coped very well with a short period in captivity and been given a clean bill of health.

Government agency Natural England ruled that as long as the beavers were disease-free, they could remain on the Rover Otter (newly freed otter shown in its natural habitat)

Beavers build dams to flood areas and provide ponds.

These in turn act as protection against predators - their 'lodges' are often in the middle of these deep ponds - and to provide easy access to food during winter.

Dams typically range in size from a few feet to more than 300ft wide, although one was once recorded as spanning 2,800ft. 

Beavers work at night, carrying mud and stones with their paws and timber between their teeth.  

‘They’ve tested free of serious infectious diseases and we’re now looking forward to starting the next phase of our work: studying the long term effects of these wild beavers on the local landscape, on local communities and local wildlife.’

Beavers, which are native to England, were plentiful in our countryside until they were wiped out by hunters in the Middle Ages.

They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary some 18 months ago.

A few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile.

It later became clear that there were in fact nine beavers, of three different generations, living on the River Otter.

DNA tests also confirmed the family were Eurasian beavers - the species originally native to the UK - rather than North American beavers (here one of the English family is pictured while in captivity during tests)

Tests, carried out by beaver experts from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland over the last few days, revealed the animals were free of bovine TB and a parasitic tapeworm that can cause serious harm in humans

At home: Officials had originally said that the wild family (one member, pictured) posed a risk to other wildlife, and might spread parasites and disease, and should be caged or killed

The beavers' impact on the surrounding landscape (dam in River Otter, pictured), fish stocks and landowners including farmers, will also be monitored over the coming years

Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams.

Some people think they may slow down flood waters, as well as boosting wildlife diversity.

Farmers and anglers have that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes.

This proved they had been quietly prospering and – crucially – breeding, and had been there for at least five years.

News of the discovery was incredibly popular locally - so people were furious when Defra, the Government’s environment department, decided they would round up the beavers.

Officials said that they posed a risk to other wildlife, and might spread parasites and disease, and should be caged or killed.

But a fierce campaign to allow the animals to remain free, backed by the Daily Mail, resulted in a dramatic turnaround.

Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, ruled that as long as the beavers were disease-free, they could remain on the Rover Otter.

They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary in eastern Devon last winter. A few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile. A screen grab of video footage of the beavers is shown

Each of the beavers (pictured during short stint in captivity) has been tagged with colour-coded ear labels, which will help officials track the individuals as they are filmed by hidden cameras

Beavers normally live in family groups and can survive up to 24 years in the wild and 35 years in captivity.

They are herbivorous rodents that build corridors in their dams to escape predators such as wolves and bears in the wild.

The animals are nocturnal and can grow to more than 3ft, weigh up to 70lbs, and feed on a diet of reeds, leaves and bark.

Beavers were hunted almost to extinction in Europe, both for fur and for castoreum - a secretion of its scent gland for medicinal properties.

Tests, carried out by beaver experts from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland over the last few days, revealed the animals were free of bovine TB and a parasitic tapeworm that can cause serious harm in humans.

DNA tests also confirmed they were Eurasian beavers - the species originally native to the UK - rather than North American beavers.

Having been cleared for the project, each of the beavers has been tagged with colour-coded ear labels, which will help officials track the individuals as they are filmed by hidden cameras.

Their impact on the surrounding landscape, fish stocks and landowners including farmers, will also be monitored.

At its conclusion in 2020, the project will present Natural England with its evidence and decide the future of the beavers.

The reason for the beavers’ (pictured) presence in Devon remains a mystery. There are captive breeding programmes in the UK, including one in Dartmoor, but none of the animals are unaccounted for

Friends of the Earth campaigner Alasdair Cameron said: ‘The return of these beavers is fantastically exciting, and a great success for all those who fought for them to remain in the wild.

‘Let us hope it is just the start. We should bring beavers back to other parts of the UK where they used to live and look at boosting or returning other species too - from the pine marten to the lynx.

‘We need to radically change our relationship with nature. Bringing back our native species will help existing wildlife, repair our ecosystems and bring more life and joy to our landscape.’

The reason for the beavers’ original presence in Devon remains a mystery. There are several captive breeding programmes in the UK, including one on the other side of Dartmoor, but none of the animals is unaccounted for.

Other explanations touted by locals include their escape from a private collection, or a deliberate release by wildlife enthusiasts.
