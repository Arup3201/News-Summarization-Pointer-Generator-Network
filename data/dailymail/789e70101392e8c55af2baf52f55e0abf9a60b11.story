Ed Woodward, executive vice-chairman of Manchester United, became the highest-paid club administrator in English football during his difficult first year at Old Trafford.

United accounts for the year ending June 2014 lodged at Companies House reveal Woodward, who took over from David Gill in July 2013, was paid a whopping £2.521million.

Woodward was top of the Premier League chief executive rich list despite struggling in the transfer window at the start of former manager David Moyes’s time in charge and facing considerable criticism for the way Moyes’s departure after 10 months was handled.

The only other Premier League club official definitely paid more than £2m is Arsenal’s Ivan Gazidis, who received £2.19m. Manchester City’s Ferran Soriano is likely to be a £2m-a-year chief but City’s accounts are less transparent.

BT Sport are confident they will sign Gary Lineker to present Champions League football next season irrespective of whether BBC lose Premier League highlights to ITV in the upcoming auction. 

Sportsmail revealed this month that Lineker was being chased by BT Sport but it was thought any deal depended on the fate of Match of the Day. However, BT are hopeful they will land Lineker even if it means a renegotiation of the contract that gives BBC exclusivity on him in the domestic TV market until 2016. 

Broadcast magazine also said Lineker was in ‘serious discussions with BT’ but a BT spokeswoman said talk around Lineker was ‘speculation’.

Eric Young, central defender in Wimbledon’s 1988 FA Cup-winning side and a trained accountant, wanted no part in BT Sport’s controversial Crazy Gang documentary. Young’s desire for privacy is such that after a chance holiday encounter with former team-mate Terry Phelan, he turned down a social drink.

The shortlist for the vacant FA chief executive’s position is understood to contain a strong female candidate. This follows headhunters Odgers checking with the FA that they were happy to have both male and female contenders go forward to next month’s interview stage. 

The quandary for the FA is how long they are prepared to wait for their preferred choice, although sources say that would be as long as necessary if there is a stand-out candidate. 

That could point to the combative Debbie Jevans, chief executive of England Rugby 2015, being on the list. She would not be available until after the World Cup in November.

Chelsea draw a blank

Chelsea, whose proposed £25million-a-year shirt sponsorship with Turkish Airlines has been delayed for some months, discovered at the Football Writers’ Association tribute evening to Didier Drogba what they could be missing out on. 

The airline, whose seven-figure personal backing of Drogba goes straight to his charity foundation, contributed to the evening by holding a draw - with mocked-up boarding passes on each seat - for two return flights to anywhere in the world. Alas, Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck did not have the winning ticket.

The Sports PR Company, who represent Drogba, have split with Tour de France winner Chris Froome, whose feisty wife Michelle wants to handle her husband’s media activities. The cycling press had been at odds with the company, who insisted on copy approval for Froome interviews.

The English counties, whose salary cap for next season has been slashed by 10 per cent, will not be happy that the England Cricket Board’s commercial department have been allocated an extra £500,000 to make five new appointments. 

This revamp after years of successful sponsorship activity comes with Jaguar not being replaced as an England car sponsor, LV not expected to renew their County Championship backing after next season and adidas downgrading their England kit supply agreement. 

The big commercial spend follows chairman-elect Colin Graves saying he would cut costs at ECB’s Lord’s headquarters.

England will host an international football tournament in 2018 after all. UEFA voted on Monday that their Under 17 Championship will have St George’s Park in Burton as its hub.
