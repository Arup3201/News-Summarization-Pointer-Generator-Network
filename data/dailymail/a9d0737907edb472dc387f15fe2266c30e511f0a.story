Most everyone likes their hash browns golden brown and their toast nice and crunchy, but new research says that the crispier some breakfast foods are cooked, the more likely they are to give you cancer.

That’s thanks to a chemical called acrylamide, which is found mostly in plant based foods and appears to accumulate the longer those foods are cooked.

And breakfast may be the biggest source of acrylamide since fried potatoes and toasted bread are some of the biggest sources of the menacing chemical.

Golden goodness? Maybe not. New research says the longer you cook potatoes, the more they'll accumulate acrylamide--a chemical found to cause cancer in mice

According to the FDA, acrylamide has likely been around forever in food but has recently been found to cause cancer in lab mice.

It seems to form in the largest quantity when foods are prepared with high-temperature cooking. That means frying, roasting or baking.

So some of the worst offenders are French fries and other fried potatoes because the tuber is already more likely than other foods to form acrylamide. When you cook the taters to a delicious, golden brown, voila: more cancer-causing acrylamide.

Like your toast burnt? You may want to think twice since it could have far more cancer-causing acrylamide, which the FDA now says to reduce in your diet by eating more veggies and fruits and by cooking foods in less heat-intensive ways

Grout for breakfast? Acrylamide isn't just found in overcooked foods, it's also used industrially in grout, water treatment products, and plastics

The chemical isn’t likely to be found in meat, fish or dairy and doesn’t seem to form when foods like potatoes are prepared through steaming or boiling.

Acrylamide isn’t just found in foods, it’s also used in commercial products and manufacturing.

Aside from a perfectly brown potato, the chemical is found in plastics, grouts, water treatment products, and cosmetics. And, not surprisingly, in cigarette smoke.

Short of telling consumers to quit eating fried, baked, or roasted foods altogether, the agency suggests a vegetable and fruit rich diet with whole grains and lean proteins.

By displacing a largely burnt toast and fried potato diet with a more varied one, you can sneak an acrylamide-containing morsel once in a while without having to worry.

Shocker: Not surprisingly, the FDA says that smokers are getting a healthy dose of the cancer causing compound as well

Potatoes are the worst offenders and toast isn't far behind

Acrylamide has been found to cause cancer in mice and the FDA now says to try to cut down on acrylamide intake by eating a more balanced diet and cooking foods like potatoes for shorter periods
