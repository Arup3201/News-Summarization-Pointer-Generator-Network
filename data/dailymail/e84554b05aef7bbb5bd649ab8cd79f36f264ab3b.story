A gaping sinkhole has opened up in the Perm region of Russia after the flooding of a nearby potash mine.

The sudden collapse led to the suspension work at Solikamsk-2, owned by the world's number one potash producer.

The hole - described as being between 100 and 130ft in diameter - appeared several miles to the east of the mine in Perm region.

Disaster: Around 1,300 miners have been told to stay away from the Solikamsk-2 mine in Russia after a 130ft wide sinkhole opened up

Gave way: Some have theorised that an earthquake in the area 20 years ago may have weakened the rock, before mining and flooding caused it to subside

Geologists are urgently seeking to understand its cause.

One theory is that an earthquake 20 years ago weakened the rock structure around the mine.

Some 1,300 miners were ordered to stay at home as an assessment is undertaken into the safety of the flooded shaft.

Workers in the mine were evacuated safely.

The hole suddenly appeared several kilometres from the mine and is surrounded by 'dacha' summer houses.

No-one was living in the homes close to the sinkhole, but many in the area are now concerned over further craters appearing in the area, linked to the flooding.

One local said: 'People have not slept for three days, waiting for new holes.'

Another stated: 'These are dacha houses in the pictures. They were empty when it happened, which was lucky. The nearest houses where people are living are two kilometres away.

'This hole appeared because the waters broke into the mine and the soil collapsed...there is almost panic in Solikamsk.' 

Collapse: Despite the ground around the mine giving way, all of the workers were safely evacuated

Huge loss: The Solikamsk-2 mine is owned by the world's biggest producer of potash - a chemical compound used in fertiliser - and may have to close as a result

A local estate agent said today residents were rushing to put their homes on the market after the sinkhole appeared on 18 November.

'The number of people who wish to sell their flat in the South of the city increased three times,' said Artem Bogushevsky, head of Khirsh agency.

'Our town has two parts northern and southern. There is really some kind of panic among the people from the southern part. They are trying to sell their flats now and move to other regions.'

However, he warned new buyers 'do not want to invest into districts with potential risk for their lives'.

The area is close to a notorious area of GULAG prisons in the Stalin era. 

The flooding is a blow to fertiliser giant Uralkali, which is traded on the London and Moscow stock exchanges.

The company accepted there could be further 'subsidence', and linked the problems to an earlier mine flooding in 1995, which some blame on an earthquake.

 Dmitry Osipov, Uralkali CEO, said: 'The accident is not catastrophic to the company's operations or people living in the area.

'The impact is being localised and we have a clear plan to tackle the situation promptly.

'We will take all necessary measures to minimise the impact of the incident on the Company, our investors, partners and the inhabitants of Solikamsk and the surrounding area'.

Solikamsk-2 mine is reported to have reserves of 150million tons amid fears that the mine will have to close.  

Uncertain: One bank estimates that the company could lose nearly half of its productivity to the collapse, putting thousands of jobs at risk

 Aexander Baryakh, General Director of the Mining Institute of the Urals Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, said: 'The site where the inflow of brine has been detected completely overlaps with the site of the incident which happened at Silvinit Solikamsk-2 on 5 January 1995.

'This enables us to conclude that the 1995 accident and its consequences are directly linked to the accident on 18 November 2014.'

But he insisted: 'There is currently no threat to the surrounding populated areas.'

 The plant has an annual capacity of 2.3million tons of potash, a crop nutrient.

'We estimate that up to 24 per cent of the company's capacity might be affected, with another 20 per cent of capacity in geographical proximity to the flooded mine,' said Renaissance Capital investment bank.

'We can not say that the mine is lost for the company,' said Dmitry Mazepin, the company's deputy chairman.

The cause of the sinkhole is seen as different to the appearance of craters in northern regions of Siberia recently.

The Siberian craters - in permafrost regions - are seen as the result of the melting of soil containing gas hydrates, leading to dramatic blowouts.
