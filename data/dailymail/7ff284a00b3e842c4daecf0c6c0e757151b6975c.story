Apple is considering launching its first Android app in a bid to sell music to users of Google's software, it has been claimed.

The firm is also considering launching a streaming service to take on Spotify.

Experts say the moves could help stem the tide of falling sales for the firm's iTunes store as streaming services become popular.

The move would be the first time ever apple has created an app for Android.

'Apple has opened exploratory talks with senior label executives about the possibility of launching an on-demand streaming service that would rival Spotify and Beats Music, according to three people familiar with the talks,' according to Billboard Biz.

'Apple is also thinking about adding an iTunes App for Android phones, the Google rival that has been growing faster than the iPhone,' the same sources said.

Apple already has 80 percent of download sales in the U.S.

However, overall, song downloads began to slump last year, and are now down about 12 percent through the first eight weeks of 2014, according to Nielsen SoundScan data.

The decline is attributed to several factors, including streaming music services like Spotify and recently launched Beats Music.

According to the LA Times, music industry insiders said Apple is pushing for a new release window — similar to the one that some Hollywood studios impose for films newly released for home viewing.

'These are really changing times, and I think everybody's going to be trying different things, whether it's iTunes, Spotify or the labels,' Irving Azoff, manager of the Eagles, Christina Aguilera and other acts, told the paper.

Apple has a history of digital exlusives. In 2010 it struck a deal with the record label EMI and the Beatles' company Apple Corps to sell digital downloads of the legendary rock band's music on iTunes.

'It's kind of up for grabs.'

According Nielson, 48% of smartphone owners use their portable devices every day to listen to streaming music, as opposed to 42% who use them for downloading music.

Another rap act relied heavily on streaming to build awareness for a forthcoming release — and debuted at the top of Billboard's album chart last week.

Streaming services such as Spotify are believed to have eaten into Apple's sales

'It's not a great strategy to try to dictate how people consume music when they're clearly asking for and in fact doing something different on a wide scale,' said Spotify Chief Content Officer Ken Parks.

'It just doesn't work for anyone.'
