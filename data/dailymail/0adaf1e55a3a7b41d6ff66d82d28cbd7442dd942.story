Rugby Football Union chief executive Ian Ritchie views England's performance since the RBS 6 Nations as unsatisfactory.

An encouraging runners-up finish in the Championship was followed by a run of five consecutive defeats, three on the summer tour to New Zealand and autumn losses to the All Blacks and South Africa.

Victories over Samoa and Australia rescued a measure of respectability from the QBE series with only eight matches left for head coach Stuart Lancaster to build a team capable of winning next year's World Cup.

Ritchie rejects the notion that England have stagnated this autumn and - while disappointed by the recent losses - he is convinced they will be ready for the global showpiece on home soil.

'It's been a very hard schedule - we've played New Zealand four times on the bounce,' Ritchie said. 'I don't make any apologies for that because we want to be playing the best in the world and judge ourselves against that.

'We've played four times against New Zealand and lost four. Verdict: that's not satisfactory and we want to do better than that.

'Absolutely this isn't a development phase. We need to be and have to be competitive and beat those teams.

'We need to be in a position of beating every team. That's what we have to do.

'But there is no doubt in my mind that the margin is pretty small. There's no chasm of difference.

'It's very marginal and now it's about making sure that margin is made up. That's the view of the coaching team as well.

'Next year I undoubtedly think we'll be stronger not weaker, whether that's because of the time the squad have to train together or the availability of players.'

It was England's fourth defeat by the All Blacks since June after losing all three games of a summer tour

Ritchie still holds hope that the team will be stronger by the time the 2015 World Cup comes around

England have finished Six Nations runners-up for the last three years and Ritchie refused to be drawn on whether the 2015 Championship is a must-win tournament given the proximity of the World Cup.

'Every match is a must win. It's a perfect start to the Six Nations, against Wales in Cardiff on a Friday night,' Ritchie said.

'That's a good game to kick off with in terms of must win. And then the third game is in Ireland.

'We will lose games from time to time, that's inevitable. But our confidence in the coaching team is such that we believe we will get it right.'
