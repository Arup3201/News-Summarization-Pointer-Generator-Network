First it was the the Duchess of Cornwall who showed off her dancing skills in India last weekend.

Now, in an apparent case of ‘anything she can do, he can do better’, Prince Charles proved he is also a great mover by joining in the Hokey Cokey yesterday during a visit to a disabled children’s school in Kandy, Sri Lanka.

Wearing a garland of flowers, a relaxed looking Prince delighted children and staff at the school, ‘shaking it all about’ with gusto.

Having a boogie: Prince Charles showed off his dancing skills with a group of disabled children in Sri Lanka

'Knees bent, arms stretched': The Prince raised his hands in the air, wiggled his hips and put his hands on his knees as he danced the 'Hokey Cokey' with the youngsters at MEDCAFEP Day School

'Oh, the Hokey Cokey!': The future King could be seen smiling, laughing and joking around as he danced

Youthful: Prince Charles even gave his beige suit a youthful lift by wearing a garland of flowers around his neck

He also took part in an arts and crafts session with the mentally and physically disabled youngsters, who were thrilled to meet him. 

It is Prince Charles's third and final day in Sri Lanka as part of an official trip to open the 2013 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm).

Yesterday, he made his first address to the Colombo-based summit on behalf of the Queen - despite calls for Britain to boycott the meeting due to human rights issues.

Curious: The Prince, who is visiting Sri Lanka with his wife Camilla, admires the work of the disabled children

Having fun: As Prince Charles toured the facility, he joined Madona Soloman, 17, who was making a rug by pushing strips of felt through a cloth using a needle

He said he was 'delighted' to be addressing the Commonwealth nations - adding: 'It is my particular privilege and pleasure to be 
representing The Queen at this, the 2013 Commonwealth Heads of 
Government Meeting'.

He also spoke of his 'admiration' for the 'fortitude' shown by Sri Lanka after a devastating tsunami in 2004.

Today, Prince Charles stood between a teacher and a schoolgirl, before taking their hands and singing and dancing to the 'Hokey Cokey'.

He gamely joined in for a number of verses of the popular children's song, but when a pianist continued playing he laughed and bowed out.

Greeting: Prince Charles was touring the Mencafep Centre for disabled children in Nuwara Eliya - an institution founded by Briton Chris Stubbs and his wife Ranji in 1988

The Prince was touring the Mencafep Centre for disabled children in Nuwara
Eliya in the centre of the island nation - an institution founded by 
Briton Chris Stubbs and his wife Ranji in 1988.

Based in a picturesque valley, it provides education, vocational training and support for families.

As Charles toured the classrooms, gardens, allotment and other areas of 
the centre, he joined Madona Soloman, 17, who was making a rug by pushing
strips of felt through a cloth using a needle.

One of the prince's entourage warned him about pricking his finger and 
he joked 'I have done. I've got the wrong sort of fingers to do this.'

Paying his respects: Prince Charles also visited Sri Lanka's most important Buddhist shrine, which contains a tooth from the Buddha himself

Sacred: The Prince was shown around the inner sanctum of the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy in Sri Lanka's Central Province. He also greeted and shook hands with other visitors, right

As
part of his 11-day tour of India and Sri Lanka, Prince Charles has also paid his respects 
at the country's most important Buddhist shrine, which contains a tooth 
from the Buddha himself.

The Prince was shown around the inner sanctum of the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy in the Central Province, Sri Lanka.

However, despite his status as Britain's future King, even he was not allowed to view the sacred artefact - it is only brought out into the public once every five years for just over a week.

Ritual: The Prince is handed a bowl of flower petals by chief lay custodian Pradeep Nilanga Dela Bandara

Tour: Despite his status as Britain's future King, even Prince Charles was not allowed to view the Buddha's sacred tooth

The relic, which was smuggled to Sri Lanka in
the 4th century by an Indian princess who hid the tooth in her hair, has been kept at the temple since 1592.

A staggering 50,000 people make the pilgrimage every five years to catch a glimpse of it.

The Prince, who carried a bowl of flower petals into the shrine, greeted and shook hands with other visitors.

He
was accompanied by chief lay custodian Pradeep Nilanga Dela Bandara - 
who wore an elaborate red velvet jacked with gold braid and had a 
ceremonial dagger tucked into his belt - and several Sri Lankan monks.

Getting to grips with nature: Prince Charles also visited the Mackwoods Labookellie Tea Estate in Kandy

Test: Staff watch as Prince Charles takes a sip of Sri Lankan tea as part of a tea-tasting session at the estate

Today's royal duties also included a visit to the Mackwoods Labookellie Tea Estate in Kandy.

During
the visit, Prince Charles joined pickers from the historic 1,000-acre 
estate on the slopes of a picturesque valley covered in rows and rows of
tea bushes.

He chatted to Thandawa Vithamerry as she deftly picked the green leaves of the plant and put them into a basket.

Neetha Martenstyna, a tea guide with 
the company Mackwoods which runs the estate, talked the prince through 
the process of producing the tea.

Verdict: Most of the teas were not strong enough for the Prince who described them as 'too mild', adding 'I like it stronger, and with milk'

Enjoyable: The Prince was later shown around the Peradeniya National Botanical gardens, also in Kandy

She
said afterwards: 'You have to pick two or three leaves and a bud. He 
was asking how long we can keep picking from the same plant and I said 
40 to 50 years and he said "so long".'

Ms
Martenstyna explained the leaves go through a detailed process that 
involved a number of stages from removing the moisture from the leaves -
called withering - to drying, rolling and eventually grading.

The Prince, who also visited the 
Peradeniya National Botanical Gardens, had the chance to sample a number
of teas and sipped from a spoon as staff explained the different 
gradings.

Caring: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, visited a Women In Need centre during the couple's third day in Sri Lanka

Royal duty: Camilla greets women at the centre, who are dressed in intricate clothing adorned with flowers

Posing: The future Queen also visited a Home Start centre, funded by Leeds City Council, which helps local mothers and their children

However, most of them were not strong enough for the Prince who described them as 'too mild', adding 'I like it stronger, and with milk'.

Before Prince Charles left the Mackwoods estate, he was given a silver-plated box containing two tea caddies, one containing Prince of Wales blend and the other containing Prince George blend.

Meanwhile, his wife Camilla stayed in Colombo where she joined an art class at Home-Start Sri Lanka, an organisation that helps children and parents to increase skills, including reading and computing.

Getting stuck in: Camilla, pictured with students at the Home-Start centre, picked out pieces of paper at random to determine the animals she had to draw

The students and the Duchess picked out pieces of paper at random to determine animals they had to draw - with Camilla picking out elephant, horse and squirrel.

As she put pen to paper she said: 'My husband is a very good painter.'

The future Queen wore a pastel-coloured 
coat as she also greeted, spoke to and posed with people at a Women In Need centre and Lady Ridgeway Hospital.
