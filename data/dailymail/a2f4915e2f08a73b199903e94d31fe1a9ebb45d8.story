Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton horrified onlookers by 'tombstoning' from a 45 foot cliff in Sardinia just days before winning today's Italian Grand Prix.

The 29-year-old had been relaxing by the beach in Italy with friends in preparation for today's race in Monza, where he beat Mercedes team-mate and rival Nico Rosberg.

He was seen relaxing on board a boat, racing a jet-ski and even taking to the water on a surfboard.

The 29-year-old was in Sardinia preparing for today's Italian Grand Prix, which he won, beating Nico Rosberg 

Onlookers were then shocked to see the driver clamber to the top of a cliff edge alongside a friend before leaping off into the sea

But, onlookers were then shocked to see the driver clamber to the top of a cliff edge alongside a friend before leaping off into the sea, only wearing a pair of swimming shorts.

One witness told the Sunday People: 'It was a real shock to see Lewis Hamilton jumping from the rocks.

'He's one of the most famous sportsmen in the world and you don't expect to see him doing something like this.

'He may put his life in danger every time that he takes part in Formula 1. But you know that racing drivers have taken every safety precaution possible.'

It is thought his jump is likely to have caused concern for his Mercedes team bosses, who would have urged him not to take part in any dangerous activity.

Lewis Hamilton, who was relaxing on a beach in Sardinia earlier this week, decided to clamber to the top of a rock with a friend 

The 29-year-old was also pictured on board a boat with friends during his time off in Sardinia 

As well as jumping from the cliffs, he also tried his hand at racing a jet-ski in the water 

The driver, who is the boyfriend of popstar Nicole Scherzinger, also gave surf boarding a go while on holiday 

The craze of jumping from cliffs, piers or harbour walls into the water below, which is nicknamed tombstoning, is a fad that has swept across Britain over the last ten years.

The name is said to come from the aim of entering the water upright and straight, like a tombstone.

According to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, since 2004 they have dealt with over 200 incidents of tombstoning in the UK, which has caused 20 deaths and 70 injuries.

The add that of those injured, the youngest was 12 and the oldest was 45.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution have both launched various campaigns to try to stop such tragedies.

They warn of the changing tides, which make it difficult to gauge water depth, as well as the dangers of hitting submerged objects or being dragged under by unexpected currents.

Winning today's Italian Grand Prix means that Hamilton has narrowed the gap at the top of the World Drivers Championship

Although tombstoning is not illegal, police have also tried various initiatives to discourage it, including safety events that spell out its terrible hazards.

The driver, who is the boyfriend of popstar Nicole Scherzinger, took time out to relax in Sardinia in preparation for today's Italian Grand Prix.

Winning the race now means he has narrowed the lead of team-mate Nico Rosberg at the top of the Driver's World Championship to just 22 points with six races to go.

In the last race, the Belgian Grand Prix, Rosberg collided with Hamilton, forced him to retire while he finished second to extend his championship lead.

There have been a series of incidents involving in the pair this season including when they refused to shake hands despite completing a Mercedes one-two at the Monaco Grand Prix, with Hamilton unhappy at the pit stop strategy his team adopted.
