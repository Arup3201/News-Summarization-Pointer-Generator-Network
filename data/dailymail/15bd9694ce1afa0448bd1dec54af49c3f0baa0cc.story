Morgan Schneiderlin was so enraged after being told Southampton would not let him leave in the summer that he considered boycotting training and matches. 

The midfielder felt hurt and cheated that he was promised an exit if the club sold their stars then when the mass exodus of their top players began he was forced to stay.

When Schneiderlin left a meeting with Southampton's board on July 29, flanked by his two agents Pascal and Sebastien Boisseau, he was furious and exploded on social media, tweeting: 'Six years of an amazing journey DESTROYED in one hour!'

It was either that or hurling a tear gas grenade back into the room, he joked afterwards when calm had restored.

But keeping hold of the Frenchman has been the shrewdest piece of business – amongst many – that Southampton manager Ronald Koeman, chairman Ralph Krueger and the rest of the club's board made in the summer. And even the player himself.

Speaking on Sky Sports after their historic win against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, Gary Neville said: 'I think he could play at any of the top clubs in the league, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United or Arsenal – he's showed his quality this season.

‘You look at Schneiderlin and Jose Fonte today, there was no sweat on them. They're composed and organised.'

At the time of that July meeting, Tottenham were in pole position to sign him.

Schneiderlin's agents had tried to ease the transition away from the club by informing them in February last year that he was interested in moving on, after almost six years of service since his £1.2million move from Strasbourg in June 2008.

Then in the summer, in the space of two months, Rickie Lambert left for Liverpool, Luke Shaw went to Manchester United, then Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren followed to Merseyside. Calum Chambers moved to Arsenal the day before the meeting.

Tottenham were pursuing Schneiderlin; he desperately wanted to move there and assumed the deal would be finalised. But that door was slammed in his face.

In truth, the 25-year-old was often overshadowed by those others in Southampton's rise from League One, then the Championship – when he signed – and up the Premier League table.

But Koeman has built a team around him; adding Dusan Tadic's dangerous creativity, Graziano Pelle's physical presence and finishing, a solid foundation behind of Toby Alderweireld alongside Jose Fonte, who has excelled this campaign, and Fraser Forster in goal.

The list could go on of Southampton players who have shone this season, with Schneiderlin so often co-ordinating their sharp, incisive attacking football from the middle while nullifying opponents in defence.

Schneiderlin was informed that he was part of Koeman's project when he was refused to leave. It turns out his role was integral.

Neville nailed it during his analysis and Schneiderlin's options are widening, with Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool all coveting the player.

He has come a long way from the 18-year-old who initially struggled to settle in England, with few French speakers in the team at the time, and even further from the teenager who would watch the Premier League on television with his team-mates – particularly Liverpool and Steven Gerrard his favoured team and player – at Strasbourg's academy.

Now he considers England his second home. With Southampton soaring in third, his home could well remain on the south coast for the foreseeable future.
