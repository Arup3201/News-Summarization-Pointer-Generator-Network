An ITV producer has quit after it emerged the broadcaster paid for students to drink potentially lethal amounts of alcohol for an investigation.

A production team picked up the bar bill for four students during a probe into binge drinking among the young.

One youngster filmed for the programme drank a potentially deadly 48 units of alcohol – the equivalent of roughly 24 pints - during a single night.

Drinking: The programme shows students Jake 
Hirst, 19, Francesca Leech, 18, Codie McBride, 21, and 19-year-old Sam 
Alexander having their alcohol consumption monitored over 'a typical night out'

The investigation, which was called 
Tonight: Britain’s Young Drinkers, examined the effect of excessive 
alcohol consumption on young people and purported to show a typical 
night out for the Liverpool students.

In fact, their alcohol was being paid for the production team at ITV Studios’ factual arm Shiver.

Today, it was revealed that series producer David Warren left ITV last month as a result of disciplinary action by the broadcaster after an internal investigation into the allegations.

The programme showed the students – 
Jake Hirst, 19, Francesca Leech, 18, Codie McBride, 21, and 19-year-old 
Sam Alexander – having their alcohol consumption monitored through a series of health checks over the 
course of what was portrayed as a typical night out.

They are first seen pre-drinking copious amounts of cheap alcohol at their university halls of residence in Liverpool.

The programme put the students, including Codie, pictured, through a series of health checks before and after their alcohol consumption, to measure the impact of alcohol on their bodies

Binge-drinking is defined as consuming five or more drinks for men, or four or more drinks for women, in about two hours, depending on body weight.

It is known to pose safety risks associated with car crashes and accidents, and to damage the liver and other organs if the behaviour is indulged in regularly.

In Britain one adult in four is a binge drinker, more than any other country in Europe.

The NHS recommends that men should not regularly drink more than 3-4 units of alcohol a day while women should not regularly drink more than 2-3 units a day

After four units of alcohol your blood flow increases, you feel less inhibited and your attention span is shorter. It's at this point you begin dehydrating which is one of the causes of a hangover.

After six units your reaction time is considerably slower, your liver has to work harder and your judgement decreases.

Even
 before they head out to start their evening, baby-faced Jake Hirst, who
 is studying international journalism, has had 11 beers, four shots, 
three whiskies and one vodka.

They then head to the city centre’s many 
bars – where they are seen downing six more shots and two double vodkas 
each.

By the time they 
return home at 3am they have drunk a staggering 139 units, with the 
girls, Francesca and Codie, drinking 25 and 26 respectively, and boys 
Sam and Jake downing 40 and 48.

To put this in context, the Government advises that men should drink no more than four units in one day, or 21 units a week.

Women
 should drink no more than two to three units a day, or 14 a week.

ITV paid for students to drink potentially lethal amounts of  alcohol for an investigation into binge drinking among the young, it emerged last night

The 30-minute investigation fronted by Jonathan Maitland and which aired in April pulled in an audience of 2.8million. Two viewers complained to Ofcom.

The incident came to light only after the outraged parents of one of the students involved in the stunt complained to ITV.

An
 ITV spokesman told Broadcast: ‘ITV carried out an internal 
investigation following a complaint from a family member of one of the 
participants in the Tonight programme.’

Mr Warren declined to comment when approached by Broadcast magazine.

The programme, fronted by Jonathan Maitland and aired in April, showed the group,  which included an 18-year-old girl, staggering home at 3am having drunk a total of 139 units over the course of the night
