Sentenced: Sophie Hartley, 22, was jailed for four years after she  deliberately slit her neighbour's throat in a violent rage following an all day drinking binge

A young woman who called herself a 'Full Time F****** Ledgend' on Facebook has been jailed after she deliberately slit her neighbour's throat in a violent rage following an all day drinking binge.

Sophie Hartley, 22, was sentenced to four years behind bars for her attack on 21-year-old neighbour Joe Arnfield during a heated row at her flat in Burnley, Lancashire.

The pair had drunk up to six litres of cider before Hartley slashed her friend's neck with a kitchen knife, leaving him scarred for life with a six centimeter stab wound.

Hartley claimed she was so drunk she could not remember the attack - initially telling police: 'If I was going to stab him, I would have slashed him up proper.'

The brunette, who described her career on Facebook as a 'Full Time F****** Ledgend' (sic) later admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

Stephen Parker, prosecuting, told 
Burnley Crown Court that Hartley and Mr Arnfield had been drinking cider at
 her flat throughout the afternoon and into the evening of March 13.

He
 said she had initially been good natured but at 7pm, her demeanour 
suddenly changed for no reason and she became aggressive and 
argumentative.

Mr Parker 
told the court Hartley had been shouting and swearing at Mr Arnfield, and 
told him she was going to 'get people to sort him out.'

Their mutual friend Gemma Wiggan had left the building earlier that afternoon, but returned to hear screaming from Hartley’s flat.

She told police the pair were engaged in a heated argument with Hartley shouting at Mr Arnfield to get out, as the pair stood
face to face, punching each other.

As the fight spilled into the kitchen, Ms Wigan said she saw Hartley reach for a kitchen knife from a drawer.

She told her to put it back as she was going to hurt someone, but Hartley and Mr Arnfield continued to argue, the court heard.

Drink: Burnley Crown Court was told that Hartley, pictured on another occasion, and victim Joe Arnfield had drunk up to six litres of cider between them before the stabbing

Ms Wigan said she then saw Hartley lunge at Mr Arnfield, thrusting the knife towards Mr Arnfield's abdomen.

'She got the impression she was trying to scare him,' Mr Parker said.

'Joe Arnfield didn’t move out of the way.

'The victim’s response was to 
start laughing. He was saying "You don’t have the balls to do it.”

'Hartley replied “Don’t tempt me, Joe.”

'He continued to laugh at her. 
Gemma Wiggan saw the defendant hold the knife up to Joe’s neck, Joe 
still continued to laugh, she withdrew the knife and turned away from 
him. He continued to laugh, she turned back to him again and in one 
movement, sliced him horizontally across the neck.'

Interview: Hartley initially claimed she was so drunk she could not remember the attack - telling police: 'If I was going to stab him, I would have slashed him up proper'

'Joe
 Arnfield didn’t appreciate exactly what had happened, everybody started
 to see blood, he held his hands up to his throat and his hands were 
covered in blood. Gemma Wiggan said to the defendant “What have you 
done ?” Hartley dropped the knife and started crying.'

Mr Arnfield then ran from the flat, where some workmen tried to help stop the bleeding before he was rushed to hospital.

Although he was left scarred by the attack, medics found that the blade had avoided any muscle, vital blood vessels or nerves.

Hartley later told police she had been drinking since lunchtime but wouldn’t have stabbed Mr Arnfield.

However, her account then changed and she claimed the pair of them had been messing around with a knife and the victim was a liar.

The court heard she had 12 previous offences on her record, many of them drink-related.

Richard Taylor, mitigating, said: 'She wants to come out of this sentence a better person.

'She says to me “I’m going to be scared of drinking anything on my release".

'She has always said to me that she recalls very little of the incident. She is extremely remorseful and is relieved that great injury, or worse, was not caused.'

Judge Jonathan Gibson sentenced Hartley to four years in prison, telling her she was lucky that Mr Arnfield had not been more seriously injured.

'It’s very fortunate for you it was a laceration which was not deep enough to interfere with muscle, vessels or nerves,' he told her.

'In the cold light of day, I am sure you appreciate you could have either seriously injured him or even killed him.'
