A Romanian couple who committed an alleged $68million tax evasion 
left behind up to $2.7million in gold and silver coins in a vast 
network of sealed bunkers on their rural Washington estate, new court 
documents have revealed.

Radu Nemes, 39, and his wife Diana, 
38, built a network of bunkers and passages and filled them with 
stockpiles of money and food at their home, set on 53 acres in Yelm.

Investigators found 88 gold coins and 10,500 silver coins however two neighbors admitted to helping the couple bury a large stash of loot on the property. The FBI have searched the land with radar but still $3million remains missing.

The Nemes' bunker could be sealed from the inside on the rural Yelm property and was stockpiled with goods. The FBI believe that $3million in gold and silver coins is still buried on the land in Washington, according to new court documents

Radu Nemes, 39, and his wife Diana, 38, are being extradited to Romania to face charges that they dodged millions in fuel taxes

The fascinating details emerged in
 recently-unsealed FBI documents on the alleged Romanian fraudsters. The
 couple were arrested in March after being accused of working with 
corrupt politicians in their home country on the massive tax dodge.

Mrs
 Nemes, who is reportedly pregnant with her third child, has been 
extradited to Romania. Radu Nemes' also waived extradition but has not 
been moved.

The couple had accrued a number of 
properties, including a $3million log cabin, and number of businesses in
 Washington which are believed to have been paid for with laundered 
money. Millions was also construction equipment and at least one yacht.

Mr Nemes and his wife Diana, poured thousands of dollars into building the elaborate bunker. The couple have two other sons, aged eight and nine.

The shelter could be sealed from the inside and had food, water filtration systems, a back-up generator, a working kitchen and practical supplies to live for months.

A stash of four pistols and two rifles including an AR-15-style assault rifle were found at the home.

Investigators searching the property with radar equipment discovered a 'fully equipped and furnished underground bunker'.

'That bunker could comfortably have housed the entire family for months if not years, given the supply of food found in storage in that structure,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Norman Barbosa said in court papers.

The FBI also reported that the Nemes had been traveling the U.S. on first-class flights. They spent more than $200,000 at designer boutiques and blew hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.

The couple allegedly moved their 70-ft yacht – the Ramaya – from the Mediterranean in late 2012. It was sold months later for $2.3million.

The Nemes, who arrived in the U.S. in 2012 after reportedly fleeing their native Romania following charges of tax evasion, settled in the quiet town, far out west.

It is then that they became members of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment (RSE).

The
 RSE was established by female leader J.Z. Knight, a business school 
drop-out from Roswell, New Mexico, who claims to channel messages from a
 35,000-year-old warrior.

Her spiritual method claims to bring 
together ancient wisdom with the power of consciousness and the latest 
scientific discoveries.

Ms Knight, (the J.Z. stands for Judy Zebra),
 a 68-year-old who has three marriages under her belt, holds retreats 
for her followers on private land attached to her French chateau-style 
mansion.

In 2007, her business filed profits of $2.6million from retreats, books, CDs and DVD sales.

The bunker could be sealed from the inside and could support the couple for months on the rural land

A
 former business partner of the Nemes, Doug McCrea, told MailOnline that despite being evidently very wealth, the couple were quiet 
and unassuming. 

He
 said occasionally the couple came for a glass of wine at his bar but 
kept to themselves. He described Mrs Nemes as a 'petite blonde' who came
 across as a very nice person.

Court documents show that the Nemes also bought a home in Thurston 
County, and were allegedly in the process of building a lavish property on the grounds with the 
illegal funds, according to investigators.

They also owned a a 
restaurant and a large commercial property in Yelm.

Radu Nemes and his wife were arrested 
by the FBI late last month and are facing extradition to Romania to face
 charges that they colluded with a high-ranking 
official to dodge millions in fuel taxes.

According to filings, Radu Nemes 
allegedly worked as part of a criminal gang to illegally import 1million
 tons of diesel fuel and sell it in Romania through shell companies 
between 2011 and 2012.

The shell companies were set up in names of homeless people to distance the Nemes from the fraud.

The massive tax dodge came by importing the fuel for manufacturing purposes then selling it directly to consumers.

Diana Nemes allegedly helped her 
husband by laundering money from the fuel scheme through Dubai accounts 
and then bringing it into the U.S.

A
 spokesman for the Ramtha school issued a statement to MailOnline in 
March saying the school 'has no information about allegations from the 
Romanian government or the student referenced'.

Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, which claims roots in the teachings of a 35,000-year-old warrior from a mystical land, was founded 26 years ago by a business school drop-out from Roswell, New Mexico.

JZ Knight (born Judith Darlene Hampton in 1946) is the spiritual school's 'high priestess' after she claims that she was visited in 1977 by an entity named Ramtha, an ancient warrior who channels his teachings through her.

Ramtha, the 'Enlightened One', marries ancient wisdom with neuroscience and quantum physics to allow followers to access their own 'direct channel' with God.

Between 1979 and 1988, Knight traveled the U.S. having private 'dialogues' with students.

In 1988, Ramtha's School of Enlightenment was founded on former ranch land in Yelm, a small city in rural Washington state.

It is 
an 'academy of the mind that offers retreats and workshops to people of 
all ages and cultures', according to its official website

By 1995, Ramtha's school had an international reputation. J.Z. Knight was touring Australia, Italy, Japan and South Africa to spread her message of how students can use their brain power to 'Become a Remarkable Life'.

The school has a 80-acre fenced compound, not open to the public, which is the site of retreats for students and staff.

The 68-year-old religious guru's company, JZK Inc. posted profits of $2.6million in 2007 from these courses along with books, tapes and DVDs. 

In 2008, Ramtha's School of Enlightenment spread to 20 more countries including the Czech Republic, Romania and Chile.

Ramtha's claims that more than 100,000 people globally have attended their spiritual events.
