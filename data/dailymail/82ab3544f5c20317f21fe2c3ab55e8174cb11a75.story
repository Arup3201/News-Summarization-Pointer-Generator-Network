A Perth father who crashed a stolen car and abandoned his injured three-year-old daughter inside the burning vehicle has been jailed for seven-and-a-half years.

Bevan Stanley Cameron, 25, was drunk on April 20 when he crashed a stolen car on Great Eastern Highway in Midland.

He fled the scene, leaving his daughter in the front passenger seat.

Bevan Stanley Cameron, 25, was drunk when he crashed a stolen car in April this year 

Cameron's daughter, who was just three years old, was injured in the crash but he fled the scene

She was treated for a ruptured bladder, cuts and bruises after the crash in Midland, Perth 

He pleaded guilty on Friday in the West Australian District Court to 10 offences including dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm and having a blood alcohol level exceeding 0.08.

The court heard Cameron first bashed the 16-year-old sister of his ex-partner with a baseball bat.

He had been looking for his ex-partner, the mother of his child, who was hiding from him.

Cameron then drove away with his daughter in a stolen vehicle, the court heard.

He later ignored a request from police to pull over and sped away without his headlights on before crashing into a concrete barrier.

Cameron's daughter was treated for a ruptured bladder, cuts and bruises.

His lawyer John Hawkins submitted that the case was 'almost something out of a novel or a Hollywood horror movie'.

Mr Hawkins said his client didn't remember the events but accepted the facts based on what other people had witnessed.

He said Cameron was appalled when he learned what had happened and hoped to one day be able to make it up to his daughter.

Judge Gillian Braddock commented that Cameron was 'completely out of control' when he attacked the girl with a baseball bat.

Cameron's lawyer said the case was like a 'Hollywood horror movie' and he was 'out of control' 

'It would not have mattered who got in his way by sound of it,' she said.

Judge Braddock said the house was full of children who would have been frightened by his violent rage.

She said while Cameron's daughter suffered no long-term physical effects from the crash, she still had anxiety about fire and travelling in cars.

'You have frightened her in a way that will be long lasting, hopefully not permanent,' she said.

She accepted that Cameron was deeply ashamed by what happened, but noted it was a very serious offence.

She said he showed a total disregard for the safety of his child and other road users.

The judge also noted that Cameron had a lengthy criminal record and had only been released from prison a few months before the incident after serving time for aggravated burglary.

Cameron was also fined and disqualified from driving for a period.

Outside court, Mr Hawkins said his client loved his daughter and wanted to express to his estranged family his sorrow and shame over his conduct.
