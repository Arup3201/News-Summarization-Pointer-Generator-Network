Jose Mourinho is adamant the battle between Petr Cech and Thibaut Courtois will be good for Chelsea - even if it puts him in a difficult position.

The Belgian keeper returns to west London after a three-year stint with Atletico Madrid, and Mourinho believes the 22-year-old's presence will be good for the club, even if it poses selection problems.

He told Sky: 'It's a good problem for me. Thibaut just arrived, he arrived as the best young goalkeeper in the world. They will fight and for me it is a good. I was never afraid to make big decisions. I prefer to make this decision than to have a keeper I don't trust.'

There have been suggestions that Cech could even leave the club, but the 51-year-old refuted those claims.

'I don't feel that (Cech's future is uncertain),' he said. 'He is working hard. He is playing without limitation.

'We have 
Diego Costa we, have Drogba and we have Torres. We have Ivanovcic and 
Azpilicueta, we have Fabregas and Ramires, we have Hazard an Schurrle.

'This is a club that wants to be strong and have real possibilities to compete. We need competition in every place. '

With
 the departure of Frank Lampard, Chelsea are also without a 
vice-captain, but the Portuguese manager explained he felt the position 
was unnecessary.

He
 said: 'The captain is John and everybody knows that. After that we 
could have any one of them so it (having a vice-captain) is something I 
am not worried with.

'We don't need that status, what we need is
 people with desire, personality and club connection, and we have so 
many of them we do not need to have this vice-captain status.'
