It may soon be impossible to find a home in London for less than £100,000 after the handful of properties on the market for five figures are being quickly snapped up by buyers, experts have claimed.

At the end of last year, just seven flats across the capital were on sale for less than £100,000, the majority of which have now been sold.

Property experts claim a 'milestone' has now been reached and it unlikely that freehold properties will drop under the £100,000 mark again unless there is a housing market crash.

'Ideal for first time buyers': The property does have a good sized bathroom complete with a bath and shower unit

Research by Placebuzz.com found it is now near impossible to buy a home in London for less than six figures unless they are sold at auction, are part of shared ownership schemes, retirement homes, student accommodation or house boats.

Andy Hatoum, founder of property search engine Placebuzz.com, said: 'The London property market has reached a milestone. 

'This may be the last time we see properties under £100k being sold in the capital, well on land at least, as currently the only properties for sale under £100k are houseboats.

'In other parts of the country you can buy a family home for under £100k - in London it won't even buy you a studio flat in one of the cheaper boroughs.

'For many Londoners on normal salaries, not City sized wages, home ownership is quite simply out of reach.'

Of the few remaining properties advertised for under £100,000 in recent months, these included four in the east or south-east of London and one in Barnet - although this was only a short term lease.

A one bed flat for sale in Tomlins Orchard, Barking, Essex, was on for £94,950 but received an offer of £110k.

Finally a two Bed flat in Kingsbury is on the market for £94,995 while a one bedroom flat in Thamesmead is still being advertised for £89,000.

This leaves bidding at auction or shared ownership as the only other option for finding a home for five figures.

There are currently three houseboats on offer in the capital - a one bed barge for sale in E1W for £99,000, a houseboat in King’s Cross for £87,000 and a houseboat near Hammersmith for £80,000.

Alex Gosling, managing director of online estate agents Housesimple.co.uk, said: 'I'm sure many people will be surprised that you could actually still buy something under £100k in London.

'The capital's property market is so hot at the moment that in many boroughs you would probably struggle to find anything under £200k let alone £100k.

'Any quality stock coming onto the market is gong under offer within hours of the "for sale" boards going up.

'And properties in the most popular areas are selling well over asking price as buyers compete against each other.

'Will we ever see properties under £100k again? I'm sure we will but don't expect to get too much space for that kind of money.

'Also, the chances are if you're spending less than £100k the property will not be in great condition.

'You might buy at a knock down price, but the refurbishment could cost you thousands.'

It comes as private sector rents in London increased at eight times the pace of those in the North East over 2013.

Every region across Britain saw an annual rise in average rental prices paid by tenants, but London recorded the biggest increase over the last 12 months at 1.6 per cent. The North East saw the smallest increase at 0.2 per cent, according to the report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The combination of increasingly higher rents and stagnate wages has sparked concern in recent years that tenants are becoming 'trapped' in the rental sector because they cannot save enough money for a deposit to make the jump onto the housing ladder.

But Government support schemes such as Help to Buy have resulted in some strong increases in first-time buyer numbers.
