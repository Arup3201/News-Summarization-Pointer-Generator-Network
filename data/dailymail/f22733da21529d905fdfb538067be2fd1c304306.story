House sale: Phil Hogan investment was a flop

Phil Hogan lost at least €100,000 in the fire sale of a ­controversial Dublin 4 house to the Fine Gael Chief Whip.

The Environment Minister sold the house to his Fine Gael colleague Paul Kehoe for €355,000 – almost €100,000 less than the mortgage he took out on it from Michael Fingleton’s Irish Nationwide.

The sale of the property was revealed in the Irish Mail on Sunday in May, when we reported that Mr Kehoe had omitted the property from his register of interests but had then altered the register when contacted by the MoS.

It has subsequently been claimed in 
media reports that the loan Mr Hogan used to buy the property, and 
another villa in Portugal, was approved personally by Michael Fingleton,
the disgraced chief executive of Irish Nationwide.

The
report claimed that Mr Fingleton had approved mortgages totalling 
€900,000 with inadequate supporting documentation and advantageous 
terms.

One of these loans was used to buy the Dublin 4 house, 17 Haddington Square, which was sold to Mr Kehoe in 2010.

The 2004 mortgage, for €453,000, was ‘interest-only for over a decade’, it was claimed.

Last
night Mr Hogan did not deny the claims when contacted by the MoS. His 
spokesman also refused to comment on the sale of the house to his 
colleague, or explain why he chose to complete the sale at a loss of at 
least €98,000.

He 
refused to explain how Mr Hogan had succeeded in having Irish Nationwide
remove its security on his house at the time of the sale, given the 
sale price could not cover the amount borrowed.

Even
if the Nationwide loan was a 100% mortgage with no deposit, he would 
have lost €98,000 on the sale. If it was a 90% loan, he would be down by
€144,000.

Mr Hogan’s 
relationship with the bank, which was bailed out by the taxpayer at a 
cost of over €5bn and is now part of the Irish Bank Resolution 
Corporation, will now come under increased scrutiny.

There were four separate charges from Irish Nationwide registered against two properties in Mr Hogan’s name since 2004.

Three
of the four charges against Mr Hogan’s homes total over €1.3m. The 
fourth has no amount registered. In addition to his property in Kilkenny
and Dublin 4, the minister also owns a luxury apartment in Portugal, 
apparently bought with some of the money loaned by Nationwide and 
secured on his Irish properties.

Both
Mr Hogan and Mr Kehoe refused to reveal the purchase price until now, 
but it is contained in the Property Price Register, which was unveiled 
this week. 

Having owned it for four years, Mr Hogan – a former estate agent – put the house up for sale.

The 2008 auctioneers’ brochure advertised it as ‘a superb townhouse in this brilliantly located period courtyard development’.

But
it failed to sell and the asking price was reduced several times. It 
was put on the market in June 2008 for €625,000, but adverts on Daft.ie 
show he was soon asking for €575,000.

Later
it was on the books of Hamilton Osborne King for €549,000. The 
revelation that Mr Kehoe and his wife bought it for almost €200,000 less
than that will raise further questions about the transaction.

The
sale came in the same month that Mr Hogan acted as a key ally to help 
Enda Kenny survive a leadership heave by Richard Bruton and his 
followers.

Earlier this year, the MoS revealed that Mr Kehoe failed to declare rental income for the house.

However,
the junior minister retrospectively changed his Dáil register of 
interests to include the Dublin 4 house after he was challenged about 
the omission.

In contrast, Mr Hogan had registered the house in his name. In
his 2007 TD’s declaration of interests, Mr Hogan recorded that he was 
part-owner of a holiday apartment at Vilamoura, Portugal.

A spokesman for Mr Hogan said: ‘We won’t be making any comment on the financial circumstances of the minister.’

Phil
Hogan’s borrowing spree topped €1.2m at one stage. His first loan from 
Michael Fingleton’s Irish Nationwide was for €330,000 for his Kilkenny 
home, but in 2004 his exposure to the bank spiralled.

Four
charges from Nationwide have been registered against Mr Hogan’s 
properties since 2004. In this time, he has bought another Kilkenny 
house, a D4 maisonette and a Portuguese villa.
