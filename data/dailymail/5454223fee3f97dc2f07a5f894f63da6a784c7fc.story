The Department of Justice may still bring civil charges against Trayvon Martin shooter George Zimmerman, Attorney General Eric Holder revealed on Thursday.

Holder told reporters on Thursday that DOJ had not concluded its investigation into the February 26, 2012 incident and the 'matter is ongoing.'

'There are active steps that we are still in the process of taking,' Holder said, according to The Hill. 'There are witnesses who we want to speak to as a result of
 some recent developments.'

Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters yesterday that the Justice Department's investigation into Trayvon Martin shooter George Zimmerman is 'ongoing'

Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, was volunteer with his neighborhood watch in Sanford, Florida, when he had the dust-up with Martin that resulted in the 17-year-old African American's death. He was acquitted of murder charges more than a year ago in a criminal court.

The Department of Justice could bring its own set of federal civil charges against Zimmerman, however, and it's still looking to, based on Holder's comments Thursday.

Justice's continued interest in Zimmerman is unusual as the department 
normally concludes it's inquiries within a matter of months.

The Hill says the Attorney General didn't offer any additional details on the government's investigation yesterday, such as when it plans to wrap it up.

When Holder was asked about Zimmerman last November, the country's chief law enforcement officer didn't give a definitive end date for the probe either but noted that 'a substantial part was resolved in the case that was tried.'

'I'm not sure exactly how much longer that will take, but we will get to
 a point where we are able to make a determination,' he said.

Holder was questioned again about the Martin shooting on Thursday at a press conference announcing a DOJ investigation related to the shooting of another African-American teen, Michael Brown.

In that case, Holder said, DOJ will review the the Ferguson, Missouri, police force to determine if its officers have a 'pattern and practice' of discrimination.

The probe follows a month of civil unrest in the St. Louis suburb after one of the mostly black town's white police officers allegedly shot and killed 18-year-old Brown.

Brown's family is being represented by the same civil rights lawyer who represented the Trayvon Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, after he will was killed two and a half years ago.

Fulton and Martin have also offered their personal support to Brown's family.

The pair traveled to Missouri last month to join the deceased teen's parents at St. Louis' Peacefest rally, an annual event aimed at ending gun violence.
