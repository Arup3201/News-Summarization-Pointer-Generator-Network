A sparkling 50-1 treble for Godolphin lit up a dramatic first day’s racing at Chelmsford City as the reborn all-weather track was handed a number of ringing endorsements on its return.

The Essex venue, formerly known as Great Leighs, closed in 2009 after going into administration less than a year after its opening.

However, under the part-ownership of Betfred boss Fred Done, £15million has been invested on the re-launched circuit since it was purchased in December 2013.

Tryster got the ball rolling for Godolphin trainer Charlie Appleby in the opening Betfred Handicap, but not before the 2-1 favourite had swerved violently across the track after hitting the front under Adam Kirby, impeding short-head runner-up Gaelic Silver in the process.

Thankfully for favourite-backers, Kirby survived a stewards’ enquiry to secure a place in the history books.

Kirby said: ‘He’s still very green. He looked at something in the straight and had a bit of a duck out. He wasn’t at full stretch at the line, though, and still had loads underneath.’

The nature of the new surface was a little unexpected for Kirby, who went on to complete a double aboard the Appleby-trained Blue Aegean in the Weatherbys Printing Handicap an hour later. 

He said: ‘I thought it was a bit deep and on the slow side. I don’t remember it being like that but it is a nice surface — perfect.’

Godolphin completed their treble courtesy of a smart five-length victory in the Fast-Track Qualifier for the Robert Havlin-ridden Tempus Temporis, trained by John Gosden, who had struck earlier on the card with Zamoura in the fillies’ maiden.

Havlin said: ‘My fella enjoyed the turns here as every time I felt he was coming back under me we started turning and he was taking me back into the bridle. The track is excellent for that with its sweeping turns.’

Newmarket trainer Ed Dunlop, out of luck in the fillies’ maiden, was another to welcome the course’s return. He said: ‘The place has been derelict for a number of years but they have done a great job and the prize money looks good, which is important.

‘It is a purpose-built venue, very close to Newmarket and it is very easy to get to if we want to gallop horses.’

Elsewhere, Ayr has abandoned Monday’s jumps fixture after a severe storm caused structural damage to parts of the course, while tomorrow’s meeting at Ffos Las is in doubt because of a waterlogged track.
