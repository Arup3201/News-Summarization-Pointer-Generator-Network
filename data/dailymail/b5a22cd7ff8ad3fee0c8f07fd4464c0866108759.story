Whether as munitionettes, frontline nurses or land girls, the contribution made by women during World War One was a vital one.

Now a new book has revealed that it was a stylish one too - and led to wardrobe innovations, among them trench coats and trousers, that remain popular today.

But in 1914, both were a long way off with women trussed up in corsets, strapped into awkward hobble skirts and burdened with huge wide-brimmed hats, regardless of class or political inclinations.

By the time armistice day arrived on the 11th November 1918, the nation's wardrobes were almost unrecognisable, with knee-length skirts, billowing harem pants and tailored uniforms taking centre stage.

This, argues fashion historian Lucy Adlington, author of Great War Fashion: Tales from the History Wardrobe, is testament to the resilience and adaptability of the women serving on the Home Front as well as an important record of changing circumstances.

'The
changing fashion over the four years of war is arguably one of the most significant 
reflectors of the changes happening in women's lives,' she explains.

'Clothes
 reveal an immense amount about status, about culture, about austerity 
or prosperity. The military 
aspect of World War One can't be properly understood without first understanding
 the culture.

Enter the trouser: Trousers were first worn by women in the mines, as this coke backer shows

'That was what sent so many men and women to serve their countries on the frontline and Home Front. Even uniforms are a 
fashion of sorts.

'The Home Front, with all these domestic 
details, is every bit as much a part of history as the mud and horror of
 the trenches.'

Although rationing of the sort seen during the Second World War wasn't introduced until February 1918, clothes became increasingly expensive as the war ground on and shortages began to bite.

As a result, most became more streamlined, with the elaborate 'directoire' style of 1914 giving way to simpler garments and comfortable working wear such as trousers.

'Narrow 
skirts, wide hats and a high waist were all the rage at the time war broke out,' explains Adlington. 

'It was the 
Edwardian version of Regency or Jane Austen fashion with lots of whites, creams and pastels.

'Fashionable 
women struggled along in hobble skirts, despite the very public demands 
of suffragettes for greater social and political freedom. Working 
women, as ever, wore what they'd got.'

By 1916, the demands of working life in Britain's factories, hospitals and arsenals had forced a sea change in the nation's wardrobes, with shorter, A-line skirts that aped military uniform becoming the ensemble of choice for patriots.

'The new 
uniforms for women doing war work required shorter hemlines on A-line 
skirts and looser fitting jackets and these were copied by civilians as
 a popular and patriotic style,' says Adlington.

The new shorter silhouette also reflected
 another new reality: With increasing amounts of textiles required to 
clothe frontline troops, getting hold of material was becoming an 
expensive business.

Elegant: Evening gowns also suffered from material shortages, becoming significantly shorter by 1916

Practical: Munitionettes such as these ones embraced a looser, more practical style and shorter skirts

'The voracious need for uniforms for the
 troops meant that wool, in particular, for civilian clothes could be 
hard to come by,' adds Adlington.

'Women were incredibly innovative about finding ways to rework old clothes to suit new styles and to make new clothes last 
longer - just like the make-do-and-mend of World War Two.

'Also, as women 
became involved in war work, they had to shrug off 
pre-war notions about chaperonage and the shorter, looser clothes 
reflected this energy and effort.'

Not everyone was impressed by the new look, however, with more conservative types raising a haughty eyebrow at the increasing popularity of trousers.

Others found them uncomfortable, among them journalist Dorothy 
Lawrence who disguised herself as a soldier in order to get to the frontline.

Sea change: By the end of the war, early examples of the 1920s 'flapper' style had become hugely popular

Sharp: Some women, Margaret Turner among them, even began to wear their husband's uniforms

'I was left alone to 
struggle with unknown buttons, braces, and the division sum of how to 
make a big body go into a small size of trousers,' she furiously wrote from the Front. 'Eventually I got in 
by a series of jumps, jerks, and general tightening up!'

But many more, among them the poet and author Vita Sackville-West, found them liberating. 'I had just got clothes like the 
women-on-the-land were wearing, and in the unaccustomed freedom of 
breeches and gaiters I went into wild spirits,' she wrote in 1917.

'I ran, I shouted, I 
jumped, I climbed, vaulted over gates, I felt like a schoolboy let out 
on a holiday.'

'Breeches were essential wear for railway engine cleaners, motorbike dispatch riders and workers in the new 1917 Women's Land 
Army,' comments Adlington.

'Some women struggled to get into them. Some hated being teased 
while wearing them in public.  Some adored the new freedom of movement 
they brought, and hated having to go back into skirts and petticoats 
once the war was over. 

'Symbolically, trousers, which had seemed so 
splendid and patriotic when needed, were unacceptable after the war, 
once women were being hustled back into their domestic roles.'

But try though they might, the genie of independence for women had been unleashed from its bottle and in the post-war world of the 1920s, there was no putting it back.

'The war accelerated social change and
 the 'flapper' look of the 1920s reflected this,' says Adlington. 'Having tasted freedom in their clothes, women were reluctant to be so confined again.'
