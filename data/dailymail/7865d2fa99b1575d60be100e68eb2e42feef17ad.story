The annual Pimm’s wars have begun, with supermarkets under-cutting each other on the popular summer drink.

Get in there quick at Tesco, where it’s £12 for a litre bottle until the end of today, or go to Asda where it’s £9 for a 70cl bottle (which works out at £12.86 a litre).

At Morrisons it is £15 a litre and at Ocado it is £18, but you get a £5 jug free.

The annual Pimm’s war has begun, with supermarkets under-cutting each other on the popular drink, you can snap up a taste of summer for £5.99 with Aldi's Austin's 70cl (left) and Sainsbury's Pitchers is £12 for 1 litre (right)

Or why not try one of the alternatives? There are drinks made specifically by the supermarkets to compete with Pimm’s at a lower price — or to offer a more upmarket version.

They are all gin-based, like Pimm’s, with added sugar and fruity flavours, though the alcohol content varies and some taste better than others.

I had the onerous task of blind-testing some in the sunshine at the weekend (made up to the same proportions of alcohol, lemonade and fruit). It’s a tough job . . .

Austin’s from Aldi

£5.99, 70cl (£8.56 per litre)

You could tell the difference between this and Pimm’s only if you tasted them side-by-side — made up in a jug with lemonade and fruit, I am sure that no one would twig that you’d used a cheap version.

Austin’s is slightly more citrussy and less sweet, and at 21.9 per cent alcohol against Pimm’s 25 per cent it is also less alcoholic. The bottle is quite a naughty copy — there’s even a signature scrawled on the lid just as there is with Pimm’s.

VERDICT: By the time you’ve added lemonade, a sprig of mint and loads of fruit, your guests will never know.

SCORE: 4/5

Summer in a cup: Pimm's is usually served with a selection of fresh fruit including strawberries, cucumber, mint and orange

Pitchers from Sainsbury’s

£12, 1 litre

A few years ago, Diageo, which makes Pimm’s, tried to sue Sainsbury’s over this copy (they ended up with just a few minor label changes), and I can see why. It tastes so similar it’s incredible!

It’s got the same amount of alcohol as Pimm’s, but there is a slightly stronger orange tang in Pitchers, and — at a push — I would say it’s sweeter, with less herbaceous notes.

However, they’ve done incredibly well at making a near- perfect version.

VERDICT: Hide the bottle and make up a pitcher . . .

SCORE: 5/5

Jeeves from Lidl

£5.99, 70cl  (£8.56 per litre)

My immediate reaction to this drink was it seemed less potent than Pimm’s, and indeed it is, with 17.5  per cent alcohol.

Also, it doesn’t have any of Pimm’s bitter, complex flavours that make it such a clever drink. It just tastes like a sweet — and refreshing, mind — alcopop. Perfectly acceptable for some, just not quite the same as Pimm’s.

VERDICT: Sweet and summery drink — good for those who really don’t like the taste of alcohol, but not my cup of Pimm’s.

SCORE: 3/5 

Worthy contenders: Jeeves from Lidl is just £5.99 for 70cl (left) while Heston from Waitrose (right) is £21.35 for the same quantity

Heston from Waitrose

Fruit Cup, £21.35, 70cl  (£30.50 a litre)

Ideally you’d make this up with ginger ale and a sprig of rosemary, as Heston suggests, but I wanted to keep this test consistent (and I didn’t have any ginger ale to hand). It’s nothing like Pimm’s in taste or look — why on earth would Heston try to copy anyone — but it is rather lovely nonetheless, with flavours of red berries and blackcurrants, and interesting back notes of Earl Grey tea.

VERDICT: It’s pricey but makes an excellent alternative to Pimm’s.

SCORE: 4/5

Sipsmith from Ocado or Waitrose

£15, 50cl (£30 a litre)

I was excited to try this as I love Sipsmith gin, and the bottle is beautiful, but it’s very alcoholic — 29 per cent — and tastes herbaceous rather than fruity. For me, it needs to be far more diluted than a Pimm’s — more like a G&T. I far preferred it with tonic water and a squeeze of lemon.

VERDICT: Better for a fruity, evening G&T than a lunchtime Pimm’s-a-like.

SCORE: 3/5

Pimm’s Blackberry and Elderflower

£9, 70cl at Asda; £12,  1 litre at Tesco (until today), Waitrose

This Pimm’s special edition sounds appealing — how can anyone not like blackberries or elderflower? But it tastes just like cola cube sweets to me — sweet, with no bitter or herb notes, and no redeeming features.

VERDICT: Yuck! Is this aimed at children?

SCORE: 0/5

Bringing up the rear: Sipsmith Summer Cup (left) is a traditional take on the original and is available for £15 for 50cl at Ocado. Pimm's has brought out a special edition blackberry and elderflower flavour for the summer £9 for 70cl at Asda and £12 for 1 litre at Tesco (right)

Gail’s Russian Rye Sourdough

£3 for 500g, Ocado

You’d be hard-pushed to find bread better than Gail’s and this is my favourite, made from a  15-year-old wild yeast starter, and allowed to rise naturally to produce a complex, delicious loaf.

Heston from Waitrose  Pork &  picCalilli  pie  280g

£2.69, Waitrose

You can’t have a picnic without a pork pie. And you can’t have a pork pie without piccalilli. Trust Heston to combine the two in this sensational,  flaky-pastry pie.

Belvoir raspberry lemonade

Around £2.29 for 750ml, widely available

Made from pressed raspberries, lemon juice, sparkling water and sugar, this stunning-looking pink lemonade tastes as wonderful as it looks.

Waitrose mojito chicken cigarillos

110g, £2.69

It’s three for £6 on Waitrose picnic products until July 15, including these delicious filo ‘cigars’ filled with minced chicken mixed with rum, mint and lime.

Asda Little Angels Soft Fruity Hand & Face Wipes

If you’re having a picnic you need a pack of wipes and these are cheap, hypoallergenic, smell lovely and are suitable for the whole family.

Asda Extra Special Smoked Salmon With Cider

120g, £5 or  two for £8

I love Asda’s Extra Special smoked salmon — it’s carved into lovely thin pieces and well-priced. This is also good, and has an interesting flavour.

£14.99, Ocado

Let your children climb trees or play hide and seek — they’ll be able to spot you a mile off on this funky rug.
