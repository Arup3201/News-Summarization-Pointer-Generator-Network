Boxing icon Carl Froch admitted he was close to tears after being made a Freeman of his home city of Nottingham on Thursday night.

The WBA and IBF world super-middleweight champion joined sporting legends Brian Clough and Torvill and Dean in receiving the honour.

Froch, who wore a purple suit by Sir Paul Smith, another Freeman of Nottingham, was handed an official scroll by Nottingham City Council leader Jim Collins in front of 2,000 fans at the Royal Concert Hall in Nottingham.

The 37-year-old told the Nottingham Post: 'I'm in the process of having a cabinet built at my house and I will put the scroll in with my world title belts.

'People say 'well what does the Freeman of the city give you?' It's not about that. It's about what it symbolises. And, for me, it symbolises an acknowledgement from my wonderful city which is proud of my achievements.

'I could cry if I carried on talking about it – it means that much to me.

'But there was one thing I had to do before the night was over and that was to have my picture taken with the Brian Clough statue with the scroll in my hand. 

'What a man and what he legend he is. That picture will mark the day as such a special occasion and will go in with the scroll and my world title belts.' 

Earlier, Froch has admitted he is ready to call time on his glittering career if the WBA and IBF world super-middleweight champion is denied his dream fight against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr.

The 37-year-old wants a showdown against the Mexican in the boxing capital of Las Vegas to complete his career bucket list.

Talks have taken place over a multi-million pound fight early in 2015 but Chavez appears reluctant to face the Nottingham fighter, who does not want to take on another British challenger at this late stage in his career. 

Froch told Sky Sports: 'That's where I am on it. I've told that to Eddie Hearn. 

'He said 'you can't do that' and you know what I can, because if that right hand I threw that connected with George Groves' chin in front of 80,000 people at the national stadium - if that's the last punch I throw in my career, I will still be smiling.' 

James DeGale, who takes on Marco Antonio Periban on November 22, is the IBF mandatory challenger to Froch, but the fight does not hold much appeal to Froch.

He added: 'I don't need to risk putting my legacy at stake for another British pretender who's not earned his stripes and without giving James DeGale any stick - he's an Olympic gold medalist, he's done well - he's not quite earned his stripes, but he's mandatory for the IBF belt.

'Do I fight him? Do I take him seriously? Yes, but if the Chavez fight can happen in Vegas for me, that is the one. 

'If the Chavez fight doesn't happen, there's a strong chance of me retiring a happy man.'
