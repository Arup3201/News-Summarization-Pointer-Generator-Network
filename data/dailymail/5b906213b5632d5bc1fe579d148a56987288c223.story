Hosted in a darkened Shoreditch warehouse and set to the thumping roar of a live, heavy metal duo, Giles Deacon's AW14 collection was always going to be quite left-of-centre.

The entire front row was decked out in Wool And the Gang beanies that had been provided in their goodie bags, and before the action kicked off there were hushed whispers as to whether Kim Kardashian's half-sister Kendall Jenner was modelling or not.

Strobe lights welcomed A-list models, who stomped down the runway in a flurry of oranges, cobalt blues and greys.

In fact, the modelling collective was more star-studded than the front row, featuring the likes of Jourdan Dunn, Cara Delevingne and - the rumours were true - Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Kendall Jenner.

Of course, all eyes remained on Cara who, in a catwalk first, documented her appearance in a video selfie on her phone for the entire duration of the model finale, before posting it on Instagram.

The collection itself proved more extrordinary than many others seen on the runway, as Giles included two entirely machine-washable pieces.

Working with P&G Fabric Care, Giles started his machine-washable revolution last Autumn, showcasing seven such dresses in Milan, saying that he wants to change the landscape of clothing care.

'My role with P&G Fabric Care is to challenge the pre-conceived ideas of what can be put inside a washing machine, and that means creating designs using future fabrics which can take centre stage on the runway and be cared for once they are inside a wardrobe.'

Giles Deacon added that he hasn't had to let his design quality slip in order to make the clothes machine-washable.

He continued: 'Since starting as P&G's global fashion consultant I
have had my eyes opened to the future of fabric care and wash
technology, I have worked with specific mills who have enabled the process to
retain the essential "Giles" elements without compromising at all.'

You'd be hard-pressed to guess which items in the collection were machine-washable, but one piece included a tunic worn by Jourdan Dunn.

Highlights of the collection included a humming bird-print dress (that also came in a machine-washable version) oversized orange knits, and one particular little black dress that was embellished with hundreds of black and white beetles.

And these were pieces of which the designer himself was pretty fond, with Giles having remarked: 'My favourite pieces are the
kingfisher print and embroideries and the lilly bug dresses'.

Despite having some of the most influential and charismatic models gracing his catwalk, Giles never has a particular muse in mind when designing his collections.

'I never have one specific muse, I much prefer the idea of
lots of different fantastic characters and characteristics. From a visual
perspective, I was interested in the melancholy of nature viewed through a
technological mindset.'

But Giles does have a good idea of what sort of woman might wear his clothes.

'The Giles girl is one who enjoys fashion and is partial to some accessible flamboyance and eccentricity,' he said.

There was certainly a feel of flamboyancy in the room, with strobe lighting and on-catwalk selfies.

Even the finale differed from its competitors, with Giles sending models down in groups of three rather than in a continual line.

Cara's trio was the one captured in her three-way video selfie.

Made In Chelsea's Rosie Fortescue, who sat in the front row, said of the show: 'It had a great vibe but it was also very wearable.'
