Thousands of Egyptians took to the streets after midday prayers in rival rallies and marches across Cairo today, as the standoff deepened over what opponents call the Islamist president's power grab, raising the specter of more violence.

This morning, thousands of 
Brotherhood members gathered in Cairo outside the mosque of Al-Azhar, 
Egypt's most respected Islamic institution, for the funeral of two 
members of the fundamentalist group who were killed during Wednesday's 
clashes.

During the funeral, thousands 
Islamist mourners chanted, 'with blood and soul, we redeem Islam,' 
pumping their fists in the air.

'Egypt is Islamic, it will not be 
secular, it will not be liberal,' they chanted as they walked in a 
funeral procession that filled streets around Al-Azhar mosque.

Ultraconservative Islamists known as Salafis are organizing their own 
rally Friday against what they say is biased coverage of the crisis by 
private Egyptian satellite TV channels.

Speaking outside his palace President Mohammed Morsi gave a fiery speech denouncing his opponents, deepening the crisis. The opposition turned down his appeal for talks, saying the president had not fulfilled their conditions for beginning negotiations.

Protesters are demanding that Morsi rescind decrees that give him almost absolute power and push an Islamist-friendly constitution to a referendum on December 15.

The decrees sparked a crisis that has boiled for more than two weeks. Demonstrations have reached the size and intensity of those that brought down President Hosni Mubarak early last year.

In a televised address late yesterday, an angry Morsi refused to call off the vote on the disputed constitution. He accused some in the opposition of serving remnants of Mubarak's regime and vowed he would never tolerate anyone working for the overthrow of his government.

He also invited the opposition to a dialogue from Saturday at his palace, but he gave no sign that he might offer any meaningful concessions. Morsi's opponents said they would not talk until Morsi cancels his decrees.

The president's remarks were his first comments to the public after bloody clashes outside his palace on Wednesday, when thousands of his backers from the Muslim Brotherhood fought with the president's opponents. Six people were killed and at least 700 injured.

The speech brought shouts of 'the people want to topple the regime!' from the crowd of 30,000 Morsi opponents gathered outside his palace — the same chant heard in the protests that brought down Mubarak.

Since the crisis erupted, the opposition has tried to forge a united front. The squabbling groups created a National Salvation Front to bring them together, naming Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, the country's top reform campaigner, as its leader.

Speaking on the new umbrella group's behalf, ElBaradei responded to Morsi's speech in his own televised remarks, saying that Morsi's government showed reluctance in acting to stop Wednesday night's bloodshed outside the palace.

He said this failure has eroded the government's legitimacy and made it difficult for his opposition front to negotiate with the president.

ElBaradei said Morsi has not responded to the opposition group's attempts to 'rescue the country' and that the president had 'closed the door for dialogue' by 'ignoring the demands of the people.'

After today's prayers, protesters began marching to the palace from several different directions.

The April 6 movement, which played a key role in sparking the uprising against Mubarak, called its supporters to gather at mosques in Cairo and the neighboring city of Giza to march to the palace.

Egypt's military intervened for the first time yesterday, posting tanks around the palace and stringing barbed wire.

The military played a crucial role in ending Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule by taking over from him to manage a transitional period, but it has stayed out of the latest crisis until now.

The recent clashes are the first time rival groups have fought openly in the streets. Thousands of Mr Morsi's Islamist supporters descended on an area near the presidential palace where 300 opponents were staging a sit-in.

The fighting erupted late on Wednesday when members of Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood chased the protesters away from their base outside the palace's main gate and tore down their tents.

After a brief lull, hundreds of opponents arrived and began throwing firebombs at the president's backers, who responded with rocks.

The crowds swelled and the clashes continued well after nightfall, spreading from the immediate vicinity of the palace to residential streets nearby.

Hundreds of riot police could not stop the fighting as officers fired tear gas in a bid to disperse Mr Morsi's opponents. 

Volunteers ferried the wounded on motorcycles to waiting ambulances, which rushed them to hospitals.

By
dawn, the violence had calmed, but both sides appeared to be digging in
for a long struggle, with the opposition vowing more protests later 
today and rejecting any dialogue unless the charter is rescinded.

'No different': Opponents of President Morsi say his rule as leader of 
the Muslim Brotherhood will be 'no different' from Hosni Mubarak

The Supreme Guide of Egypt's Muslim 
Brotherhood, to which Mr Morsi belonged before he was narrowly elected 
president in June, has appealed for unity.

Divisions among Egyptians 'only 
serve the nation's enemies', Mohamed Badie said in a statement.

Opposition activist Hamdi Ghassan said protesters would arrive from other parts
of Cairo later in the day, accusing Mr Morsi's supporters of bringing in 
people from the countryside to boost their presence.

Mr Morsi's opponents accuse him of 
seeking to create a new 'dictatorship' with his November 22 decree.

The president has defended the move
as necessary to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by 
Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political 
transition.

Around the palace, traffic was moving
through streets strewn with rocks thrown during violence in which 
petrol bombs and guns were also used. Hundreds of Morsi supporters were 
still in the area, many wrapped in blankets and some reading the Koran.

'We came here to support President 
Mursi and his decisions. He is the elected president of Egypt,' said 
demonstrator Emad Abou Salem, 40. 'He has legitimacy and nobody else 
does.'

Mr Morsi's opponents say the Muslim 
Brotherhood, the group that propelled the president to power in a June 
election, is behind the violence. The Brotherhood says the opposition is
to blame and that six of the dead were Mr Morsi supporters.

WESTERN CONCERN

The United States, worried about the 
stability of an Arab state which has a peace deal with Israel and which 
receives $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid, urged dialogue. Britain has also
called for restraint and an 'inclusive' political process.

Egyptian Vice President Mahmoud Mekky proposed 'personal ideas' for a negotiated way out yesterday, saying 
amendments to disputed articles in the constitution could be agreed with
the opposition. A written agreement could then go to parliament, to be 
elected after this month's referendum on the constitution.

But the opposition stuck by its demand for Mr Morsi to cancel 
the November 22 decree and postpone the referendum before any dialogue.

Protests spread to other cities, and offices of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party in Ismailia and Suez were torched.

But Mr Mursi has shown no sign of 
buckling under pressure from protesters, confident that the Islamists, 
who have dominated both elections since Mubarak was overthrown, can win 
the referendum and the parliamentary election to follow.

As well as relying on his Brotherhood
power base, Mr Morsi may also draw on a popular yearning for stability and
economic revival after almost two years of political turmoil.

Opposition coordinator Mohamed 
ElBaradei said yesterday the street action and the polarisation of 
society were pushing Egypt into violence and 'could draw us to something
worse'.

The Egyptian pound plunged 4 per cent today to its lowest level in eight years, after previously firming
on hopes that a $4.8 billion IMF loan would stabilise the economy. The 
Egyptian stock market fell 4.4 per cent after it opened.
