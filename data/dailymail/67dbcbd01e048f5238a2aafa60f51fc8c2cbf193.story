David Cameron has publicly acknowledged that rival Boris Johnson wants to be Prime Minister - but said he still wanted him back as an MP.

Discussing the Mayor of London’s political ambitions in an interview, the Prime Minister admitted for the first time that Mr Johnson ‘wants my job’.

But instead of trying to keep him away from the House of Commons, Mr Cameron described Mr Johnson using a footballing analogy as a ‘great striker’ who he wanted back in his team.

Mr Johnson has promised to serve out the whole of his second term as Mayor, which ends in 2016, but Mr Cameron raised the possibility he could stand as MP at the same time as running London.

The Mail revealed earlier this month that Mr Johnson was being urged to return to the Commons at the general election by Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne.

Allies said both of them were urging him to ‘get stuck in’ to the campaign by standing in 2015, and some Tories even suggested he could be offered a senior role such as party chairman.

However, the Prime Minister today goes further in his public support for Mr Johnson’s return to the Commons.

Speaking to The Sun, the Prime Minister suggested Mr Johnson could even be his successor, saying: ‘It wouldn’t be a great job to have if people didn’t want it. There is nothing ignoble about wanting my job’.

As to whether he should stand at the next election, Mr Cameron said: ‘That is what I think he should do. I want to get him back in Parliament’.

‘It’s a bit like football, if you have 
got a great striker you want him on the pitch. He can complete as Mayor,
 or he can stay on as Mayor and come back to the House. I want him on 
the team.’

Mr Cameron, who attended Eton and Oxford University with Boris Johnson, said he had unique qualities. ‘He has an amazing capacity to defy gravity that other politicians don’t. And also he is fun.

‘I find him genuinely amusing.’ But he added: ‘Underneath there is quite a serious person beavering away.’

The Prime Minister first made a direct overture to Mr Johnson at the Conservative party conference in October but did not comment on what the timetable for this might be.

He said at the time: ‘My message to Boris is, “You’re a brilliant Mayor of London, you’ve done a great job, you’ve got a lot more to give to public life and it would be great to have you back in the Commons”. But that’s up to him.’

The Mayor has encouraged speculation over the years about whether he wants to be Tory leader. But Mr Johnson’s allies say he is sceptical of recent attempts to woo him back to the Commons before the next election as an attempt to call his bluff.

Earlier this week, Mr Johnson’s father, Stanley Johnson, called for a change in the rules so his son could stand as leader of the party without being an MP – suggesting this could happen if Mr Cameron loses the next election and the party seeks a fresh direction.

A leadership bid would infuriate the Chancellor as Mr Osborne, backed by the education secretary Michael Gove, also carries ambitious for the top job if the Conservatives flop at the next election.

Mr Johnson angrily told supporters this month he felt the attempt to bring him back into the fold next year was at attempt to ‘tie him in’ if the Tories lose.
