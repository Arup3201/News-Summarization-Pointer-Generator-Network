Celtic's Europa League match against Romanian side FC Astra on Thursday night is in severe doubt due to fog.

The Scottish champions are due to take on the Group D minnows at 8pm local time (6pm GMT) in Giurigu – which is roughly one hour-and-a-half’s drive away from Bucharest.

However, with fog affecting the area, contingency plans are already being made to play the match on Friday. 

That would have the knock-on effect of causing Celtic’s Premiership visit to Aberdeen on Sunday to be rescheduled.
