She's a world renowned style icon with some serious selling power, so when the Duchess of Cambridge welcomed her first child, he was undoubtedly going to be one trendy tot.

Despite having designers bending over backwards to dress Prince George, Kate has been flying the flag for traditional British brands.

In his charming Christmas portrait, the 16-month-old wore a pair of corduroy shorts and socks by Amaia Kids.

Super fans: The Duchess of Cambridge, 32, popped into a local Chelsea boutique to snap up some clothes for Prince George and the shop owners said she is a 'lovely and down to earth' lady

The co-owners, whose shop is located in Kate's stomping ground of Chelsea Green, say they are 'delighted' that the Royal chose to dress her son in their designs.

Speaking to MailOnline about George wearing the £36 Griotte shorts and £7 socks, Amaia Perso, the shop's co-owner, said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge has been visiting our shop regularly ever since George was a little baby.

'We feel really proud and honoured. We are a small brand and she could have taken her pick of any brand, so we are really really grateful to her for picking us.'

Within moments of Prince George's latest photos appearing online, the tills at Cath Kidston were ringing as parents rushed to get hold of the 16-month-old's £32 tank top. Then, sales of the Start-Rite shoes he wore went through the roof, too.

Discussing Kate's style, Amaia said: 'She always gets it right and picks the right outfit for the right occasion'

No doubt Amaia Kids will be reaping the rewards of the royal touch - and, say the owners, they couldn't pick a better brand ambassador. 

'I love the Prince's style,' Amaia said. 'It's classic, cute and he is very suitably dressed as a royal baby. It's great that he wears so many British high street brands.'

The boutique's workers are huge fans of Kate, too. Amaia added: 'My business partner Segolene and the girls at the store have met Kate and they always say what a nice, lovely and down-to-earth person she is.'

Discussing the pregnant Royal's style, she said: 'I think she always gets it right and picks the right outfit for the right occasion. She always looks fantastic and I love the way she mixes high-end fashion staples with high street brands.'

It seems that the 32-year-old Duchess has been swapping children's style notes with her brother James's girlfriend, Donna Air. 

TV presenter Donna has been shopping for her daughter in the store, as has Geri Haliwell, Kate Hudson, Sienna Miller and Claudia Schiffer. The world's most stylish celebrity offspring, Harper Beckham, has also worn designs by Amaia Kids. 

Prince George on Wednesday arrived at Buckingham Palace to kick off the Christmas festivities. Prince George was driven in with his parents, seated alongside nanny Maria Teresa Borrallo.

The Queen's annual pre-Christmas lunch is a royal tradition and allows her to catch up with more distant relations, who are not invited to join her at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk on the 25th.

All of the senior royals, among them Prince Charles and Camilla, William and Kate, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex are expected at the country estate on Christmas Day and appear alongside the monarch at the traditional Christmas morning church service. 

George, who was adorably smiley as he peered out of the window, is due to celebrate his second Christmas at Sandringham next week - and his last as an only child.

The 16-month-old royal and his parents are also due to relocate to Anmer Hall on the Sandringham Estate where an extended nursery big enough for two babies has been prepared.

George's new sibling is due in April and will live with his or her parents and older brother at the Norfolk property. The little prince will also have to share his nanny, who is expected to help care for the new arrival.

Carole and Michael Middleton, who have spent a considerable amount of time with Prince George over the last year, are also expected to take a hand in raising the new arrival and will join the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Anmer Hall on Boxing Day.
