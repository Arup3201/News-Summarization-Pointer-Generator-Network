A new documentary is lifting the veil on one of the most exotic travel destinations that very few people know exists.

Socotra: The Hidden Land offers a revealing look at the remote island’s stunning landscapes and its people, whose ancient beliefs and lifestyles are under threat as they embrace modern practices and technology.

With hundreds of endemic plants and animals the four-island archipelago of Socotra has been dubbed the Galapagos Islands of the Indian Ocean and one of the most alien landscapes on Earth.

The ‘lost world’ territory that belongs to Yemen is best known for having 800 rare species of flora and fauna – a third of which are found nowhere else on the planet.

Located 155 miles east of Somalia and 210 miles south of Yemen, Socotra lures adventurers with its sandy beaches, limestone caves and towering mountains, in addition to its unusual wildlife and vegetation.

While plenty of attention has been given to the flora and fauna, the island’s 40,000 residents remain somewhat of a mystery to the outside world as they have been isolated from modern society.

The documentary, directed and produced by Carles Cardelus, exposes the islanders’ lives and customs as they struggle to preserve centuries-old traditions.

He tells the island’s story through its shepherds, fishermen, traditional healers and imam.

Mr Cardelus, who is in London for a screening of Socotra: The Hidden Land at the UK Film Festival, told MailOnline Travel: ‘They have ancestral cultures and they are now very focused on the influence of modern ideas.

‘A few years ago fishermen never used money because they shared the fish. Capitalism is going there and this is changing their culture very fast.

‘The landscape and all the environment is amazing. It’s like time was stopped.’

The island is a  popular destination for eco-tourists, daredevil travellers and wildlife spotters

At one point in the documentary the Barcelona-based filmmaker meets a local healer who uses ancient rituals and medicines to rid his patients of evil spirits.

Mr Cardelus, 33, said: ‘Some people believe in spirits, but some say they have doctors on the island now so they don’t need the healers who use plants. Their cultures are changing very fast.

‘They love the new things. For example, many people are selling their land to buy a car or a bigger boat. They love all these new things.’

Socotra has been called one of the most alien landscapes on Earth thanks to its unique flora and fauna

He suggests people do extensive research before they visit the island and take great care to respect the islanders’ Islamic customs and traditions.

A popular destination for eco-tourists and daredevil travellers, Socotra does not have any traditional holiday resorts or luxurious hotels, and very few people speak English.

It offers very basic lodging or campsites where people sleep under the stars in a hot and dry climate.

Mr Cardelus said: ‘The climate is strong. It’s very hot and very windy but it’s a strong desert in the middle of the sea. It’s like going back in time.’

 In the film, Mr Cardelus and his crew spent time with fishermen on the Arabian Sea

The Unesco World Heritage Site lacks proper tourist infrastructure but it is a haven for those who are into hiking, diving, surfing or wildlife spotting.

In the film, Mr Cardelus and his crew spent time with fishermen on the Arabian Sea, where pirates lurk, and they learned about the islanders’ rituals and beliefs and explored Socotra’s incredible landscapes during their two visits to the forgotten island.

It is the first documentary from Mr Cardelus’ production company, Kilogram Box. The screening is taking place at Electric Cinema Shoreditch, East London, on Friday afternoon.
