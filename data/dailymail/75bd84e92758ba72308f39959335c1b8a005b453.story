Peter Rodger, father of UC Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger, will break his silence and speak about his son for the first time in an interview with Barbara Walters on Friday.

In the wake of the massacre, the film director and his ex-wife released a statement saying it was 'hell on earth' learning their son was the perpetrator, but neither have given a formal interview.

The special episode of 20/20 was taped earlier this month and will air on June 27 at 10pm, Buzzfeed reports. It will be Walters first return to television since retiring on May 16.

Mr Rodger, a Hollywood film director who worked on The Hunger Games, spoke out for the first time about his son Elliot (above) who killed six and injured 13 before committing suicide in a rampage last month in California

While she won't have a regular show anymore, Walters will continue contributing to ABC for special projects like the Rodgers interview.

The ABC interview comes just a month after Mr Rodger met with the father of one of his son's victims.

Dramatic photos show Peter Rodger and Richard Martinez embracing in an emotional moment just two weeks after the spree killed Martinez's son Chrisopher, 20.

Courageous Martinez met Rodger at a Santa Barbara coffee shop on June 1. They wouldn't discuss details of what they called a 'private conversation between grieving fathers', but did say that they reached common ground.

'We plan to work together so other families such as ours will not suffer as ours have,' Martinez told the station.

Martinez has been an outspoken critic of the nation's gun laws since his 20-year-old son, Christopher Michaels-Martinez, was shot in the rampage that left five other UC San Barbara students dead. Police believe the killer took his own life after crashing his car as officers moved in.

Elliot Rodger's parents issued a statement the morning after the killings that they were "staunchly against guns" and support gun-control laws.

They said in another statement Thursday that it had been 'hell on earth' knowing their son's actions led to tragedy.

'We are crying out in pain for the victims and their families. It breaks our hearts on a level that we didn't think was possible,' Peter and Chin Rodger said in the statement.

'It is now our responsibility to do everything we can to help avoid this happening to any other family.'

Rodger killed six people between the ages of 19 and 22 on May 23 after years of what he claimed was rejection and ridicule and sexual jealousy because he was a virgin.

He took his own life after his shooting rampage and it was claimed in the days afterwards that his family had tried to get him professional help weeks before the massacre.

The killer's mother, Li-Chin Rodger, was the first one to realize that something was awry at the time of his killing spree.

Victim: Christopher, 20, was one of six students to be killed in May's attack

Emotional: One day after his son was shot dead, Richard Martinez, center, blamed Christopher's death on 'irresponsible politicians and the NRA'

Li-Chin, who have been divorced for many years, received an email from her 22-year-old son shortly after 9pm on May 25 which included a 140-page manifesto.

She immediately went to Elliot's YouTube page and saw that he had uploaded a video called 'Retribution' wherein he describes how he plans to slaughter sorority girls.

His mother knew something was horribly wrong and she called her ex, filmmaker Peter, and after they watched the video, they called 911.

Both parents rushed to the scene separately and reportedly realized they were too late once they heard news reports of the ongoing rampage on the car radio.

In the immediate aftermath the parents gave permission to a close friend to speak to the media on their behalf, explaining how Elliot had been receiving professional help for some time.

'(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health,' Simon Astaire told CNN.

'They thought he was in good hands.'

Change: Richard Martinez, who son Christopher was shot dead in May's attack, called for tougher gun laws

Richard Martinez has become a crusader for more stringent gun laws in the wake of his son's killing.

In late May, Martinez addressed a crowd of about 20,000 who gathered for the University of California Santa Barbara memorial, the crowd got to their feet and joined his chant of 'Not One More'.

Mr Martinez used the memorial to call for an end to gun violence, telling the crowd: 'Too many people have died, and there should be not one more,' NBC Los Angeles reported.

'How many more people are going to have to die in this situation before the problem gets solved?' he asked.

'They [politicians] have done nothing and that's why Chris died ... in my opinion,' Mr Martinez said.

'It's almost become a normal thing for us to accept [mass shootings] ... It's not normal. Life doesn't have to be like this.'

Composed: Richard Martinez also read statements from relatives of other victims, including the Hong family who called for 'Hatred to be gone with the wind'
