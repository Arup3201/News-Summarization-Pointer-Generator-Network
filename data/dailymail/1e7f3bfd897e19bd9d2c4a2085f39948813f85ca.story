A ‘pint of Plain’ is no longer your only man – as Guinness has just launched two new porters in a bid to get a taste of the action in the booming craft-beer market.

The beer's production centre in Dublin, St James's Gate, will today start pumping out two new tipples, Dublin Porter and West Indies Porter, which will bear the name of the world-famous beer brand.

Both are said to offer a modern twist on hallowed Guinness recipes.

New contenders: Guinness has released the two new beers in an attempt to cash in on the craft beer trend

Irish craft breweries have expanded rapidly in recent years, with companies springing up in mostly rural locations across the country.

Guinness’s head of innovation, Nick Curtis-Davis, said the two new bottled beers the company is releasing today are updated versions of historic recipes from the brewery dating back 145 years.

He said the new beers are a reaction to the ‘broader repertoires’ of the Irish consumer but denied that Guinness was seeking to edge other smaller competitors out of the market.

‘I have to take my hat off to those guys because they are really invigorating the world of beer and we would love to co-exist with them, we are not looking to take them on.

‘What’s happening in craft beer is like manna from heaven. There’s never been a better time to be involved in beer – people are interested in beer again.’

The new venture into brewing comes as the company prepares to release a new blonde beer in a bid to tempt American drinkers.

The paler brew will be brewed in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, but will use imported Irish yeast.

The Irish Daily Mail sampled the new Guinness porters and here are our verdicts:

Dublin Porter: Will appeal to the fan of regular Guinness who seeks something with a bit more refreshment and a sweeter touch.

West Indies Porter: Has the refreshing tang of hops many seek out in the multitude of Indian pale ales on offer in bars and off-licences. But as with many craft brews, will need to be approached with caution; at 6 per cent abv it packs a punch.
