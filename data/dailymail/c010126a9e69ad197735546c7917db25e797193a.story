To whom does this Alaskan Klee Kai belong?

It is said that after a while dogs begin to resemble their owners... so can you figure out to which celebrities these cute pups belong?

Mother-of-two Peaches Geldof, stylist Gok Wan, and models Daisy Lowe and Elle Macpherson are just some of the stars who let legendary London-based dog photographer Gerrard Gethings pap their pet as part of a new exhibition to raise money for animal charity Dogs Trust.

Producer Mark Ronson, Blur bassist Alex James, model Yasmin Le Bon, designer Henry Holland, former guitarist with The Fall Brix Smith-Start and The Saturdays' Vanessa White also took their dogs into the studio to have their turn in front of the camera.

The Feeling frontman Dan Gillespie Sells, Paul Weller's daughter Leah, fashion expert Caryn Franklin, designer Charlotte Olympia, actor Leo Gregory and former TOWIE star Lydia Bright also had their dogs take part in Gerrard's exhibition The Company Of Dogs.

The resulting prints will be auctioned online via pet community Pets Pyjamas and be on display for one week only in Pets Pyjamas' Shoreditch headquarters.

Discussing the exhibition, Gethings 
said: 'Filling a gallery with fifty intimate yet oversized portraits of 
dogs is a dream come true.

'My aim with the portraits is to capture the 
seemingly human side of canine emotion as well as those dog-like traits 
we all recognise.

'The pictures have been taken from low angles to appear
 as natural as possible and are almost always focused on the eyes.'

Two labradoodles pose beautifully for Gerrard Gethings... but who takes them home at the end of the shoot?

Speaking to MailOnline, he explained why having dogs on set is never going to be boring: 'They rarely do exactly what you want them to and so there is an 
element of chance to the results.

'You control the lighting, bring in the
 dog, and then move the set up around according to the dogs behaviour.'

He continued: 'They don't understand subtle direction like models, and the whole shoot 
often becomes very physical.

'Their unpredictability means that you have 
to try and create your own luck. Nothing is guaranteed but then when you
 do get the shot it is all the more rewarding.'

This is Olive the miniature Schnauzer... but whose house does she live in?

And which celebrity dogs particularly well-behaved? 'Brix Smith-Start and Yasmin Le Bon's 
dogs were pretty amazing. It was apparent that they spend a lot of time 
together and the dogs trust them.

'Getting three dogs to sit perfectly in
 a line is much trickier than it seems but Yasmin managed this very 
easily.

'Brix was just hilarious. She stood behind me with her head above
 my camera, speaking to the dogs in that amazing way of hers.

'Lots of 
different intonations to keep the dogs interest as she listed all the 
things they were interested in - these ranged from the fishes in the sea 
to the ghosts in their house. The dogs were genuinely engaged and I was 
in stitches.

'Henry Holland's dog was pretty fun too but for different 
reasons: my own dog Baxter became obsessed and spent the entire shoot 
trying to mount the poor little thing. In the end we had to lock shut 
him in the kitchen to cool down.'

This beautiful Rhodesian Ridgeback is called Marlon - but what's his owner's name?

Ted the Kerry Blue terrier belongs to someone who feels very at home with a microphone in his hand...

Gethings'
 reasons for working with Pets Pyjamas and Dogs Trust were simple: 'It 
was a no brainer really. I wanted to do a show with Pets Pyjamas and we 
agreed that it should be for charity.

'Dogs
 sharing their lives with the rich and famous and dogs yet to be homed 
have been lit and photographed in the same setting'

'The
 Dogs Trust have a policy which states that they never put a healthy dog
 down. This alone made me want to work with them, and after meeting the 
team I knew we'd made the right decision.

'Dogs
 sharing their lives with the rich and famous and dogs yet to be homed 
have been lit and photographed in the same setting.

'It is striking that 
although the animals are physically and socially so diverse they behave 
in almost exactly the same way.

'It would be difficult to guess the ones 
going home with Elle Macpherson and those waiting for a new home - they 
all crave human love and will all do anything for a piece of cheese.'

Who dressed this dapper little French Bulldog?

Following a private preview, the exhibition - held at The Gallery, 81 Leonard Street, EC2A 4QS - will be open to the
 public from 21 March to 29 March, 10am to 5pm. Bidding in the online 
auction opens here today.

Denise
 Elphick, co-founder of PetsPyjamas.com, said: 'At PetsPyjamas we are 
passionate supporters of Dogs Trust and truly admire photographer 
Gerrard Gethings' work.

'His portraits wonderfully encapsulate the true 
character and soul of each of the dogs featured.

'We are proud to have 
organised this event to raise money and awareness for dogs in need and 
also to showcase Gerrard's fabulous work. We hope everybody bids for 
these beautiful portraits.'

Clarissa
 Baldwin OBE, chief executive of Dogs Trust, said: 'Dogs have long been 
seen as man's best friend and this exhibition is a shining example of 
the beauty of our furry friends.

'It's hard for us as dog lovers to 
imagine that there are so many abandoned dogs looking for new homes, and
 that’s where Dogs Trust comes in.

'Dogs of all shapes and sizes can be 
found at our network of rehoming centres across the country.

'We hope 
that this exhibition will not only help the Dogs Trust canine stars 
featured have a chance of a new start, but through the monies raised all
 of the other dogs that pass through our doors each and every day.'

At whom is Maggie the puggle gazing with those big puppy-dog eyes?

Peggy the French Bulldog is a tiny little thing belonging to...?

Whose floppy-eared King Charles Spaniel is Toffee?

FOCUS ON THE EARS, NOT THE EYES,,,

With dogs, is rarely the eyes 
that depict the personality. The eye thing is an old habit picked up 
photographing people.The thing that best shows a dogs personality/mood
 is the position of the ears.

Getting the ears into a desirable position
 is key. If a dog is slightly wary, which they often are on set, their 
ears will go down. This doesn't make for an attractive portrait.

I will 
often get an assistant to leave the room and knock on the door to get 
the ears to prick up. This can backfire and send the dog into fits of 
barking but you work with what you have. The shoot is always quite 
organic in this respect.

HAVE TREATS HANDY

The sitting part is almost always 
down to food. The greedier a dog is the easier it is to photograph.

My 
own dog is obsessed with food and will never, ever take his eyes off a 
biscuit. This is the ideal scenario because dogs don't generally follow 
objects with their eyes, but will move the entire head.

This baby long-haired Chihuahua is Luna... but who is her owner?

This way they 
can be manipulated into lifting or lowering their head to the desired 
position.

For dogs that aren't interested in food then maybe a squeaky 
toy.

Absolutely anything that holds their attention can be used - but, to 
be honest, I have rarely met a dog that won't play ball for a piece of 
cheddar. 

DOWN, BOY

I would say get down low. Lie on the 
floor for a dogs eye view. They look much better shot from low angles.

WEAR WHITE

If you don't have professional lighting is to 
simply wear something white. If you are close enough to the dog It will 
reflect light into his/her eyes and can really bring a picture to life.
