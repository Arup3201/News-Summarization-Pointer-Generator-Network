David Cameron has taken personal charge of trying to avert an A&E winter crisis.

The Prime Minister has ordered live updates on waiting times and treatments to ensure the NHS can cope with a surge in demand as temperatures fall.

It follows warnings that the number of patients waiting up to 12 hours on trolleys has almost doubled in two years, with Labour seize on the figures to claim the health service is struggling to cope.

Charge: David Cameron has asked for live updates on waiting times in the NHS

Downing Street has ordered unprecedented levels of planning for the winter, including £500million for the most stretched A&E departments to cope over the next two years.

Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, warned last week: ‘All the worrying indicators are up already. And they seem to indicate that this winter will probably be worse than last winter, which was the worst we have ever had. It’s a tipping point for the NHS’s delivery of acute care.

‘It’s not chaos in emergency departments, but it is a crisis.’

The latest figures from NHS England, the body in charge of the health service, show there were 87,186 trolley waits of between four and 12 hours from April to October 2013.

This figure is up from 47,644 for the same period in 2011. And the numbers having to wait up to four hours in A&E - the Government’s target time - has increased by 43 per cent in two years.

However, the government insists that targets for 95 per cent of people to be seen within four hours is still being met, and the average waiting time in A&E is now 50 minutes, compared to 70 minutes under Labour.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has sought to blame GPs for not seeing patients out of hours, forcing many more to go to casualty departments.

Mr Cameron is now ‘working very closely’ with Mr Hunt with ‘a particularly focus around A&E’, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.

‘A&E departments can come under particular pressures during the winter period. He does want to and continues to be updated on the very latest available NHS performance statistics, including the A&E statistics.'

Warning: Accident and emergency units across the country are at 'tipping point', senior doctors have warned

The spokesman added: ‘We know that A&E has seen 1.2million more people compared to three years ago, a significant increase.

‘Over the recent period the NHS A&E departments have been meeting the 95 per cent performance measure.

‘The Prime Minister has already announced across the next two years £500million of extra resources, particularly targeted at those trusts with the A&E departments that may face the greatest pressure.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband has accused Mr Cameron of being ‘clueless’ about the winter crisis facing the NHS.

Mr Miliband claimed the NHS ‘isn’t safe’ in Mr Cameron’s hands, and blamed the government’s reorganisation for diverting health funding to pay for six-figure pay-offs for managers.
