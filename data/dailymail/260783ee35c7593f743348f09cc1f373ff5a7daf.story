Hannah Cockroft won Britain’s first Paralympic gold on the track last night in a stunning display that saw her smash the Paralympic record.

The 20-year-old wheelchair racer – nicknamed ‘Hurricane Hannah’ – and one of the ‘faces’ of London 2012 stormed to the T34 100m title to the delight and roars of 80,000 packed in the Olympic Stadium for the opening day of athletics.

A strong pre-race favourite, Cockroft, who has a condition similar to cerebral palsy, led from the front on a dry, warm night to easily win her first Paralympic medal in a time of 18.06 seconds.

Her win came on a mixed day for Paralympic GB that saw cyclist Mark Colbourne win gold in the Velodrome but Jody Cundy, a seven times Paralympic champion and favourite for another cycling gold, was controversially disqualified.

Jon-Allan Butterworth, Aileen McGlynn, and Shaun McKeown won silvers in the cycling while Darren Kenny bronze took a bronze in the Velodrome.

While in the pool there were five silvers for Oliver Hynd, whose brother Sam Hynd took bronze , Stephanie Millward, James Crisp, Heather Frederiksen and Aaron Moores. In the stadium there was a bronze for Aled Davies in the shotput.

Cockroft’s appearance had been one of the most anticipated of the Paralympics with many tipping her to be the track star of the Games.

From her teens, when her father, an engineer, built a training “roller” for her racing chair in the basement of the family home in Halifax, she has had to contend with being described as Britain’s ‘new Tanni Grey-Thompson’ – the record- breaking 11 time Paralympic champion.

Cockroft suffered two heart attacks due to an infection she contracted when in the womb. 

As a result of this, her brain was starved of oxygen – leaving part of her brain damaged and affected her back, legs, hips and part of her hands, which means she has problems with fine motor skills, mobility and balance.

Her mother Rachel, 49, who watched her daughter’s first gold last night, said: ‘It’s very much like cerebral palsy but  Hannah doesn’t get the stiffness. She’s able to get about but not very far.’

She said her daughter took a little longer to start walking than other children her age, and ‘was in her buggy a lot longer than normal children would be’.

When Hannah started school, her 
mother Rachel said the disability didn’t particularly affect her. She 
added: ‘She looked differently and she walked differently and there were
limitations in PE.

‘But
it didn’t hold her back. It didn’t affect her schooling – it was more 
the little sort of things – she can’t tie her shoelaces for instance. 
There were frustrations, because she couldn’t walk far she couldn’t 
always go into town with her friends.’

Defying the odds: Hannah is already a multiple world record holder - despite doctors saying she would never be able to do anything with her life when she was born

At the age of 13, Cockroft began playing wheelchair basketball and was spotted at the national schools event by Dame Tanni’s husband Ian who gave her a go in the champion’s wheelchair.

‘She immediately got hooked on speed,’ her mother, a teaching assistant, said. ‘After seeing how much she loved it her father and the community came together to raise the funds to buy her a sprinting chair. It wasn’t long before she was picked up by British Athletics.

‘She was originally pencilled in to take part in the Rio 2016 games but she did so well at the World Championships that she was brought forward for London.’

Mrs Cockroft travelled to the stadium last night with her husband, Graham, 50, an engineer, and two brothers Joel, 23 and Daniel, 16.

Channel 4 has been rewarded with big audiences for its £6million investment in the Paralympic Games.

The opening ceremony on Wednesday drew more viewers than any of its other programmes over the past ten years.

This is the highest for a Paralympics 
event in recent history - although some way from the top figures in 
excess of 12 million the BBC was achieving for the main Olympics.

And around 3million tuned in to watch Great Britain in the wheelchair basketball between 9 and 10pm on Thursday.

Other events have had encouraging audiences, with daytime peaks of around 1.8million.

Many viewers said they had been put off by the style of the coverage, which has been criticised as too sombre, with not enough live action and too many ad breaks.

Viewers were particularly furious when the live coverage of Johnathan 
Fox’s gold medal-winning performance in the pool was not shown because 
it clashed with the start of the news at 7pm.

However, the network, which is broadcasting more than 400 hours of coverage and 150 hours in peak time, has been praised by the International Paralympic Committee for its commitment to the Games.

A spokesman said American coverage, which is being run by NBC, was disappointing by comparison because there was very little coverage and nothing broadcast live.

‘Great Britain is leading the way, as is the rest of Europe,’ he added.
