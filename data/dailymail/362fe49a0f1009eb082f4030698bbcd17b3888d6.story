A 1,000-pound cow jumped a 6-foot fence surrounding a slaughterhouse in Pocatello, Idaho, and led police officers on a wild chase through city streets before they caught up with the heifer and killed it.

Pocatello Police Chief Scott Marchand said his officers fired two shots at the bold bovine because it posed a safety risk to the public.

The cow had taken off from Anderson Custom Pack, a meat processing plant, on Friday afternoon as it was being prepared for slaughter.

Hoof chase: The 1,000-pound cow was being prepared for slaughter Friday when she made a run for it, jumping a 6-foot fence and fleeing for her life 

At around 12.30am, the heifer tipping the scales at 1,000lbs leaped over a fence and ran for her life, reported Idaho State Journal. 

Early in the police pursuit, an officer shot the hoofed fugitive in the head, but the cow continued galloping.

The hurt heifer led cops and animal control officers on a 50-minute chase on foot and in cars, during which she rammed a truck and two patrol vehicles, and rampaged through a playground.

The runaway cow was eventually cornered in a residential backyard and was gunned down by an officer.

The cow caused only minimal damage to city vehicles, and no one was injured in the incident.

The carcass of the animal was then loaded onto a truck and returning to the meat processing plant.

But as it turned out, Friday’s wild cow chase was only the opening act in a bizarre slaughterhouse saga, which played out in Pocatello over the weekend.

On Sunday, four more heifers broke free from the same meatpacking plant.

One of the horned fugitives met the same fate as the first runaway cow and another animal was captured alive, but two heifers were still at large as of Monday evening.

The owners of the Anderson plant said that the four cows had been brought to the facility Saturday and placed in a corral. The next day, employees discovered that gate had been opened, reported the Idaho Statesman.

Down for the count: The carcass of the heifer was then loaded onto a truck and returned to the plant

Slaughterhouse five: Between Friday morning and Sunday, a total of five cows fled the plant. Two have been killed and one has been captured alive, but two more are still on the loose 

On Monday morning, the four escaped bovines were spotted by Union Pacific Railroad police in the rail yard, prompting another police chase.

An Anderson plant worker eventually cornered and killed one of the escapees in a residential area a mile from the facility at around noon Monday.

Around the same time, another heifer was captured behind a construction equipment business and returned safely to the slaughterhouse.

The two cows that are still at large have been valued at $1,500 each.
