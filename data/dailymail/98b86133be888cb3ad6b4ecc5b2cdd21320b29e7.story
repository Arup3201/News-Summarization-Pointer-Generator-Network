Mystery: Dr. Dennis Olvera was found dead by his son but friends say he would not have killed himself

Family members have been left stumped after a doctor and his adult son were found shot dead in a Utah national park, in a tragedy police believe could be a double suicide.

Father-of-three Dennis Olvera, 65, from Pennsylvania, and his son Aarron Olvera, 40, from Arizona, were found dead in the Maze area of Canyonlands National Park on Saturday.

Police are investigating the deaths of the men, who were both found shot in the mouth, as a possible double-suicide. They said there could also be a possibility that it was a murder suicide.

Garfield County Sheriff Danny 
Perkins told the Salt Lake Tribune that the gun found between their bodies was registered to 
one of the men but would not say to which one.

He also would not reveal which man was holding the gun but said there were no signs of a struggle before the deaths..

'Everything we have come across so far -
all the evidence from our investigation and from the medical examiner's
office - indicates that this was a suicide,' he said.

Deaths: Aaron Olvera, 40, and his father Dennis Olvera, 65, have been found shot dead in the Maze area of Canyonlands National Park in Utah with a single gun between their bodies

Yet some things just do not add up, he added to the Salt Lake Tribune.

Neither
men had ever indicated he wanted to kill himself to family members or 
friends, and the two apparently had plans to return to their homes.

They
were carrying ample food and water, had already booked accommodation at
a motel for the end of the trip and had beer in their pickup truck, 
Perkins said. They also had bought return flights.

'I think something happened out there that was not planned,' he said.

The investigation is continuing; 
police are still looking for their base camp and hope to gain access to a
locked mobile phone which they found at the scene.

The
elder Olvera's business partner and friend of 25 years, Doug Dugger, 
told the Tribune that 'there's no way' he shot himself as 'he thought 
suicide was a weakness'.

Questions: Authorities are investigating whether it was a double-suicide or a murder-suicide

He was the vice president of 
Developmental Services Alternatives Inc., which offers treatment for 
people with mental disabilities, and was known locally as an expert on difficult behavioural issues.

Dugger added that while he did not 
know Aarron Olvera as well, he said that relatives had told him that it 
was also unlikely that the man would kill himself.

But Perkins said it appeared no one else was at the scene apart from the Olveras.

'We're convinced there was nobody there besides the two individuals,' he said.

Both men were visiting the park from 
out of state and had been dead for a few days by the time they were 
found in Lou's Springs at the national park, which is about 250 miles 
south of Salt Lake City.

Authorities had began searching for the father and son after a relative reported they had failed to return from their hike.

The bodies have been sent for autopsies and  toxicology tests, but authorities said they are uncertain they will yield any more answers about how exactly the deaths unfolded.

'We may never know,' Gardner said. 'It certainly is a bizarre incident.'
