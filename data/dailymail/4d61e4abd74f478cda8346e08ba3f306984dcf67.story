Eugenie Bouchard has taken to Twitter to show her appreciation for her time at Wimbledon a day after the Canadian's straight-sets loss in the women's final to Petra Kvitova.

Bouchard, despite the backing of the Centre Court faithful, could do little to stop the terrifyingly good Kvitova, who took just 55 minutes to win 6-3, 6-0.

Even Buckingham Palace played their part, dispatching Princess Eugenie to the front row of the Royal Box to cheer on her namesake.

Bouchard, though, won't be giving up her dream of winning her first Grand Slam title just yet.

'I will never be satisfied,' she said.

'I want to play in many more Grand Slam finals.'

Bouchard, it seems, is returning to her motherland after the disappointing defeat.

But the 20-year-old didn't forget to tweet her support for Roger Federer in the men's final against Novak Djokovic, saying: 'Hoping to land to good news! #roger #wimbledon'

Bouchard's own win was not to be on Saturday, as she proved no match for Kvitova, who looked hellbent on winning her second Wimbledon title.

The world No 6, having won her first in 2011, fell flat on the Centre Court lawn after securing the triumph and made her to the player's box via the handy 'safety gate' that has been introduced.

Her win included breaking Bouchard six times, and winning seven consecutive games.
