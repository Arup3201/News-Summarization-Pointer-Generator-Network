After months of tense battling between 20 publishers desperate for a big money windfall in the long run, Amanda Knox finally has a book deal.

Knox, 24, of Seattle, Washington, has signed for a reported $4million with HarperCollins to write about her murder conviction and acquittal in Italy.

While the deal will be respite for her family who spent $1million just dealing with her trial, it will provoke anger from her alleged victim's relatives.

Deal: Amanda Knox, whose conviction and eventual acquittal of murder charges made headlines worldwide, has an agreement with HarperCollins to tell her story

The deal is expected to distress the family of
Meredith Kercher, 21, the British student who lived with Knox in
Perugia, found in a pool of blood.

Knox, who was jailed for four years in Perugia, has only spoken publically once
when she arrived back in the U.S. following her release last October.

Her family spent more
 than $1million in legal, travel and living costs to be near her during 
the murder trial in Italy - and even more on her 
appeal.

Knox's parents, Edda Mellas and Curt Knox, who divorced when she was aged just two, have put on a united front and took out second mortgages.

‘Knox will give a full and unflinching account of the events that led to her arrest in Perugia,’ a HarperCollins spokesman said on Thursday.

He added that she will talk about her 
‘struggles with the complexities of the Italian judicial system’ and 
read back journals she kept in prison.

‘Knox will talk about her harrowing experience at the hands of the Italian police and later prison guards and inmates,’ he said.

HarperCollins is promising she will 
‘reveal never before-told details surrounding her case’ about ‘the most 
challenging time of her young life’.

The book, currently untitled, is 
tentatively scheduled for early 2013. The mammoth financial agreement was disclosed by the New York Times.

It was negotiated by Washington 
attorney Robert Barnett, who has worked for President Barack Obama and
 former President George W. Bush.

Some 20 publishers were interested in the book and Knox met with seven, all of whom submitted bids during a recent auction.

HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham said that Knox, who studied creative writing, would work with a collaborator.

The company should be able to recoup some of its investment by selling TV interview rights on the back of the book.

Broadcasters are banned from paying for interviews but they routinely get around it by buying the rights to the interviewee’s book instead.

Her editor will be Claire Wachtel, whose other authors have included crime novelist Dennis Lehane and journalist Cokie Roberts.

Publishers in recent years have shied 
from controversial defendants, especially since the fiasco of O.J. 
Simpson's ‘If I Did It’.

That was a fictionalised account of 
Nicole Brown Simpson's murder that was cancelled in 2006 by 
HarperCollins in response to public outrage.

After Casey Anthony was cleared last 
year of killing her two-year-old daughter, several publishers said they 
would not consider a book by her.

‘I think it’s a huge gamble for somebody,’ a publisher who had no intention of bidding on the story told the New York Times earlier this month.

‘It’s not like she has been exonerated in a clear and definitive way.’

Harrowing: The value of Knox's story has been compared to that of Jaycee Dugard, seen in 1991, who was held captive for almost two decades in California

She had a book published last July that 
has sold 1.2million copies. But while the deal is good news for Knox, 
her legal issues are not over.

Earlier this week, Italian prosecutors
 asked the top court to reinstate the murder convictions of Knox and her
 former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito.

Sollecito, who had reportedly been considering seeing Amanda at Christmas, has since been pictured kissing and cuddling Annie Achille.

Miss Achille is an Italian volleyball player who is also his distant cousin.

Knox meanwhile has been seen hand-in-hand in Seattle with her new boyfriend, guitarist James Terrano.

Prosecutor Giovanni Galati said he is ‘very convinced’ that Sollecito and Knox were responsible for  Miss Kercher's death in November 2007.

But the Italian appeals court in October said the guilty verdicts against the pair were not corroborated by any evidence.

It added that the court hadn't proven they were in the house when Miss Kercher was killed.

A third defendant, Ivory Coast-born 
drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted in a separate trial of sexually 
assaulting and stabbing Miss Kercher.

His 16-year sentence, reduced in appeal from an initial 30 years, was upheld by Italy's highest court in 2010.

Meanwhile, a lawyer for Knox recently filed an appeal of her slander conviction in Italy.

The same court that overturned her 
murder conviction upheld the charges for slander - for falsely accusing 
bar owner Diya ‘Patrick’ Lumumba of involvement in the slaying.

Lumumba was freed after two weeks in prison for lack of evidence. Knox later said she was ‘manipulated’ during her lengthy police interrogation.

A judge set Knox's sentence 
for slander at three years, less than the time she spent in prison. That
 meant she could leave Italy and return to Seattle.
