A nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, who cared for an Ebola-stricken colleague, has revealed today that medical staff were woefully ill-prepared for the crisis and even given supposed protective clothing with gaping holes at the neck.

Briana Aguirre, who has worked at the Dallas hospital for three years, admitted to Today that Ebola had not even come up in conversation prior to the arrival of 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan at the facility last month.

She said: 'We never talked about Ebola...we were never told what to look for.'

Two nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian, Amber Vinson (left) and Nina Pham (right) have contracted Ebola at the hospital where they worked while caring for 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan when he was desperately ill 

The nurse said that an optional seminar on Ebola had been offered once or twice at the hospital but it only provided information and not hands-on training to deal with the deadly virus. 

Ms Aguirre cared for nurse Nina Pham, 26, who was diagnosed with Ebola this weekend after caring for Mr Duncan, who died from Ebola last Wednesday. 

Ms Aguirre said that although her protective gear had been upgraded from the original mask, gown, gloves and booties - there was still a gap of several inches at the neck.

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital today released details about their protocols: 

According to Texas Health today, nurses who interacted with Mr Duncan wore personal protective equipment consistent with the CDC guidelines. 

Staff had shoe covers, face shields were required, and a filtering mask which was optional – 'consistent with the CDC guidelines at the time', the hospital emphasized.

The nurse told Today that by the time she was involved in Ebola care at Texas Presbyterian, staff were wearing protective Tyvek suits. 

Although the suit zipped up to the collarbone, went up in a hood around her face and was layered with a protective mask - there was still a gap below the chin. 

Nurse Aguirre said: 'To be honest, I threw a fit. I just couldn't believe it, in the second week of an Ebola crisis at my hospital, the only gear they were offering us allowed our necks to be uncovered.'  

She asked an infectious disease nurse why the suits allowed her neck to be exposed and was told to cover the gap with strips of one-inch tape. 

Ms Aguirre said that she asked someone, who identified himself as vice-president of Texas Presbyterian, why they could not request better protective gear from surrounding hospitals. 

The nurse said the administrator promised to call her back with some information on where to get help - but never did. 

Ms Aguirre did not care for Mr Duncan but  heard from colleagues that he was held in an area within close proximity to seven other patients, healthcare workers were moving in and out while not wearing protective clothing.

'The same nurse caring for him was caring for three other patients. She was not wearing anything close to what we're wearing now,' she added.

The nurse spoke to Matt Lauer on Today where she said she was deeply worried about losing her job after revealing the chaotic response to Ebola - but said that she felt revealing the failures was the right thing to do.

Ms Aguirre, who is not a nurses' union member, was close to tears as she described her job as the 'best she ever had' but admitted that some staff at the hospital would not be happy that she had made them look bad. 

The mother-of-two young daughters told Today: 'I’m the breadwinner of my family. I’m terrified. I’m just like the majority of middle class, working class people.

'I’m just a couple of paychecks away from not being able to pay my mortgage and I’m terrified about that.'

Ms Aguirre appeared with her lawyer on Thursday who said that Ms Aguirre was a whistle-blower and that he hoped the American people would support her for coming forward and sharing what was going on at Texas Presbyterian.

It was announced today that the chief of Texas Presbyterian will face a grilling from Congress over how his hospital reacted in response to the deadly virus. 

Dr Daniel Varga will attend a hearing, along with CDC director Tom Frieden, to investigate why so many failings are being made dealing with Ebola in Dallas.

The initial patient, Liberian national Thomas Duncan, was sent home from the hospital on September 25 with antibiotics after presenting with a fever and telling staff he had just arrived from West Africa.

He was admitted with contagious symptoms three days later and died last Wednesday.

Since then, two nurses who cared extensively for Mr Duncan, cleaning up his waste and inserting catheters, have also been diagnosed with Ebola. 

Medical records released by Mr Duncan's family show Miss Vinson inserted catheters, drew blood, and dealt with Duncan's body fluids before he died. 

Nurse Nina Pham, 26, is reportedly in a good condition and being treated in isolation at Texas Presbyterian.

Nurse Amber Joy Vinson, 29, was transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia on Wednesday. She is said to be 'ill but clinically stable'. 

Earlier this week, nurses at Texas Presbyterian angrily insisted there were no protocols in place for dealing with the virus - and claimed that no hospital in the country was prepared to deal with the deadly virus.

The director of the National Nurses Union, RoseAnn DeMoro, directly contradicted the CDC's initial claim that a breach in protocol led to the infection of Miss Pham as she treated Mr Duncan.

Hazardous waste from Duncan was 'left to pile up to the ceiling in one room', according to the nursing organization.

Nurses were forced to use medical tape to secure openings in their flimsy garments, worried that their necks and heads were exposed as they cared for a patient with explosive diarrhea and projectile vomiting, said Deborah Burger of National Nurses United.
