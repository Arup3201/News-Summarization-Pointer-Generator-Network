Four Victorian teenagers who spent nearly 36 hours glued to a popular video game have smashed a Guinness World Record for their marathon session.

The youths, form Warnambool in south-west Victoria, claimed the feat previously held by a group of German teenagers after carefully planning their game play, allocated breaks and eating habits which included strategically stuffing bottles of water, snacks and sandwiches underneath their chairs so that they were easily accessible.

Played in the hall of the teenagers' high school, at least one of the four were required to be manning the controls at any one time, and only after every hour could they take a 10 minute break.

The teenagers lasted a marathon 35 hours and 46 minutes in front of the popular video game Mario Kart

Harry Twyford, 17, told Daily Mail Australia the quartet had to film footage of them playing the popular video game Mario Kart and have qualified scrutineers such as Justices of the Peace keeping log of their 'longest video game marathon playing a racing game.'

Mario Kart was the game of choice for the record breaking effort

'We had witnesses came in every few hours who signed logbooks,' he said.

'We got sore eyes but had eye drops that helped, and I kept a food supply under the chair with water bottles and sandwiches trying to just keep them healthy.'

Harry, who spent one of the longest periods in front of the video game, lasted a 15-hour stretch in which he saved up is hourly-rest increments for a midnight nap.

He was helped by friends James Hickman, Josh Alexander and Matt Smith who all helped conquer the Guinness record which started at 8am on Friday and finished at 7.45pm on Saturday night.

Harry said the idea came about when he was reading a record book and felt the urge to want to break one of his own.

The record attempt was for a racing-style game and Harry, the brainchild behind the idea, chose the popular multi-player game Mario Kart

He said it was 'easy picking a team' because the four or share an interest in video games, and in particular, an interest in the popular multi-player version Mario Kart that pits opponents against one another on various racing circuits.

He said It took hours of practice and plenty of concentration, but the four managed to ward-off the onset of illness to take out the German-held record which was previously 30 hours long.

The marathon session was watched by family and friends inside the Brauer College at Warrnambool and the four even managed to raise $500 for a new cancer centre which is being built in the Victorian town.

Responding to criticism on Facebook about their achievement, Harry said the record took six months of hard work and planning to achieve.

'You may be thinking we're a bunch of slackers, bludgers and lazy students, when as a matter of fact this was an incredibly difficult thing to achieve which required assistance from copious amounts of individuals in the community,' he told ABC.
