Cable network HGTV has cancelled reality series Flip It Forward before it even airs after the presenters were exposed as right-wing extremists.

Twin brothers David and Jason Benham are the sons of controversial evangelical minister Flip Benham and have a history of preaching against homosexuality, abortion, divorce and Islam.

The network, home to a range of home improvement shows, acted after Right Wing Watch reported on the twins' extreme views on a host of issues and David Benham’s stance as an anti-gay activist.

Twin brothers David and Jason Benham have had their upcoming HGTV show cancelled after their extremist views on issues such as homosexuality were revealed

In 2012 David Benham had led a prayer rally outside of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, NC, in which he told conservative radio host Janet Mefferd that America’s Christian majority must repent for tolerating ‘homosexuality and its agenda that is attacking the nation’ and ‘demonic ideologies tak[ing] our universities and our public school systems.’

He also said his brother had joined him in the prayer protest. YouTube footage also shows David leading protests outside of abortion clinics.

On Thursday morning HGTV released a short statement which said that the network had decided not to move forward with the Benham Brothers' series. The show had been due to debut in October.

The network had announced that it was working with the Benhams on the home-flipping series at a launch in L.A. last month.

‘After a decade of flipping houses for profit, brothers David Benham and Jason Benham now help families buy the homes they never thought they could afford,’ said HGTV when announcing the show.

‘In each episode, the guys help a deserving family find a fixer-upper and transform it into their forever home - with a healthy dose of sibling rivalry between the brothers along the way.’

Ironically at the same presentation, HGTV also announced that it had also given the green light a design competition show from Ellen DeGeneres.

The brothers responded to HGTV's announcement with a statement in which they said that they don’t ‘discrminate against people who do not share our views.’

‘We were saddened to hear HGTV's 
decision. With all of the grotesque things that can be seen and heard on
 television today you would think there would be room for two twin 
brothers who are faithful to our families, committed to biblical 
principles, and dedicated professionals. If our faith costs us a 
television show then so be it.’

David Benham is married to Lori and has five children, while Jason is married to Tori and has four children. Both brothers live near Charlotte in North Carolina.

Their father Flip is leader of the abortion-clinic protest group Operation Save America, which split from the militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue in the late 1990s.

He baptized Norma McCorvey – the plaintiff in the landmark Roe v. Wade decision – and has protested outside mosques while shouting ‘Jesus hates Muslims’ and blamed the Democratic Party for promoting a ‘culture of death’ that caused the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado.

He was convicted in 2011 of stalking a Charlotte abortion provider and was sentenced to 18 months probation.

Speaking out about the current controversy, he told LifeSiteNews that his family had not been notified about the cancellation before the network's public announcement.

‘We have some contractual obligations to the people we are helping right now,’ he said.

He also called the homosexual activist lobby ‘the biggest bully in the country.’

The twins are the sons of controversial evangelical minister Flip Benham, who has been active in the pro-life movement since the early 1980s

‘There's no one who dares oppose them,’ he said. ‘No corporation would dare stand up to this juggernaut of the homosexual agenda.’

He said his family did nothing to hide their views from the network, which is distributed to 98 million U.S. households. ‘We knew – and so did HGTV – that this was a possibility,’ he said.

He was sorry his sons had to pay for the actions of their father. ‘I think of my sons, who have to suffer for the fact that their dad speaks up about the Gospel of Jesus Christ,’ he said.

But he held firm: ‘Homosexuality is not a good thing. It destroys those who practice it and nations that approve of it.’

In 2012 while speaking at a North 
Carolina rally for a constitutional amendment that would define marriage
 only between a man and a woman, David Benham said: 'We have no-fault 
divorce; we have pornography and perversion; we have homosexuality and 
its agenda that is attacking the nation; we have adultery … while the 
church sits silent and just builds big churches.’
