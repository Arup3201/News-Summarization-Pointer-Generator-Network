INXS guitarist Tim Farriss may tragically never play guitar again after severing his finger in a horrific boat accident.

On the Australia Day weekend the 57-year-old reportedly caught his left hand in an electronic anchor winch on a boat near his Fairlight home in Sydney's northern beaches, completely removing his ring finger, according to News Limited. 

Farriss is reported to have already undergone two operations, including an emergency six-hour microsurgery which successfully reattached his finger.

INXS have experienced a surge in popularity following the 2014 telemovie 'Never Tear Us Apart'. Injured Farriss (far left) is pictured with (from left to right) Kirk Pengilly, John Farriss and Andrew Farriss last year

The Sydney-based rock star still does not have any movement in his ring finger.

'Thank you for your concern. I'm not at liberty to discuss it at the moment,' Farriss' son Jake told Daily Mail Australia. 

Although the surgery successfully reattached his finger, Farriss has a long recovery ahead of him after suffering serious damage.

The extent to which he will be able to use his left hand will not be known for at least several months.

Farriss will reportedly undergo intense physiotherapy for at least a year.

'Tim is now home from the hospital with his family and undergoing physiotherapy as part of the recovery process,' Murphy told the Daily Telegraph.

'He is getting the best possible care and we hope with time he will regain movement in his finger. This was a terrible accident, we are all here to support him.'

The eldest of the Farriss brothers, Tim is a talented guitarist and passionate about his music.

The now 57-year-old was one of the driving forces of the band in their early days. He was their first manager, organising gigs and promoting the band.

'Initially it was only Tim who believed we could go somewhere. He was always the car salesman, the one pushing us, getting us gigs and talking about us,' INXS bass guitarist Garry Beers has said.

The band has had renewed success following the release of the 2013 Telemovie series, 'Never Tear Us Apart' reliving the early days of the band up until the tragic death of lead singer Michael Hutchence in 1997.

Following the telemovie their 2011 album 'The Very Best' rocketed up the charts, remarkably making them the highest selling Australian artists for 2014. 

As the spotlight returned to the band, so too did their fans. 

The horrific accident occurred near his Northern Beaches home in Fairlight where he lives with his wife Beth (pictured). They have two adult sons, Jake and James
