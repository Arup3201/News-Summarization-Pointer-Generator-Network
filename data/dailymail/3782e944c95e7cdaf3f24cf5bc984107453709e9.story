Survivor: Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro, 40, lived through a usually-fatal birth complication when her daughter was delivered by cesarean

A new mother whose heart stopped beating after a rare complication while giving birth miraculously survived 45 minutes with no pulse.

Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro, 40, was saved by 'divine providence' after her cesarean section went badly wrong.

Amniotic fluid from her womb got into her bloodstream and had stopped her heart beating - which is usually fatal.

Doctors at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital in Florida, were just about to pronounce Graupera-Cassimiro dead when her heart restarted for no obvious reason.

The complication came just after she gave birth to a healthy daughter, Taily, who is now two and a half weeks old.

Grauper-Cassimiro passed out for three hours while medics battle to bring her back. They assumed they had failed, and called her family into the operation room to declare her death officially.

Her family had already been told there was nothing more that could be done. 

But the mother of two, who works in human resources, defied expectations in the September 23 ordeal, and, even more stunningly, suffered no brain damage other other ill-effects.

She is now at home and caring for her child. This week she returned to the hospital to thank the medics who helped save her.

At the reunion, she said: 'I don't know why I was given this opportunity - but I'm very grateful for it. 

'God had the right people in the right place', she told the Sun Sentinel.

Grauper-Cassimiro was awake and talking to her family after her 'unremarkable' cesarean when she suddenly passed out. 

Medical workers used shock paddles and chest compressions throughout the emergency to try to restore heart beat and circulation while she was unconscious.

Despite a three-hour fight to save her, when Grauper-Cassimiro's pulse gave out, doctors thought she would surely die, and had told her distraught family as much when she pulled through.

A hospital spokesman said: 'She essentially spontaneously resuscitated when we were about to call the time of death.'

'Today she is the picture of health.'

Doctors had no immediate explanation for her survival. The spokesman called her survival 'divine providence.'
