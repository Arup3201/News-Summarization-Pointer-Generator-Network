A treasured image of missing Madeleine McCann has been used to advertise trips to Portugal.

The picture was the last taken of the three-year-old before she disappeared from her parents' apartment in Praia da
Luz five years ago.

But today the emerged the poignant snap is being shown on a website boasting: '£20 off: Great discount on holiday bookings.'

Madeleine McCann on the day she went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal. This was the image reportedly used on a website selling holidays

The site sells breaks in a self-catering
family apartment in Albufeira, Algarve, just 25 miles from the resort where Madeleine vanished five years ago.

The photo, on discount website VoucherDigg, was snapped hours before the youngster disappeared from the apartment.

Madeleine's parents Kate, 44, and Gerry, 43, have been desperately searching for her since May 2007.

Last night the couple's spokesman Clarence Mitchell branded its use 'appallingly insensitive'.

Top London law firm Carter-Ruck has been called in to demand the removal of the picture with 'immediate effect'.

Mr Mitchell told the Daily Star: 'This is an appalling use of Madeleine's picture and whether it is a result of hacking or a mistake it must be removed immediately.

The last picture of Madeleine before she was snatched is used with the caption: '£20 off - great discount on holiday bookings over £400...'

'Kate and Gerry are fully aware of this and are horrified. We understand it has been on the website for 24 hours.'

Underneath her picture are the words 'best value''. When users click on it they are taken to a page featuring the same image and deals from lowcostholidays.com.

The advert also urges holidaymakers: 'Hurry up for time is limited. Take the ones you loved and enjoy your life.''

VoucherDigg has not commented.

Meanwhile, The Sun reported today that three new clues have emerged over a potential sighting of the child in Spain.

A blonde girl fitting Madeleine's description was seen at a campsite on the Costa del Sol three days after she was snatched a few hours drive away in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3, 2007.

A witness said the groggy-looking child seemed alienated from the German family she was staying with in a caravan.

Now British police have been told the family paid extra for bringing one child more than expected when they arrived at the site on May 6.

And questions over the number plates on their car have raised fears they could have been fakes used to dodge detection.

Holidaymaker Karen Sisson, 49, who saw the child at the Cabopino campsite, near Fuengirola, said she got no response from cops when she raised the alarm at the time.

Karen, of Gibraltar, told The Sun that the girl wore a pink T-shirt, shorts and a beige hat and seemed 'out of it'.
