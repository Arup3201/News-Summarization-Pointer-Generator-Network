Louis van Gaal still intends to contest his FA disrepute charge despite asking the governing body for an extra 24 hours to officially respond.

Van Gaal was charged for criticising referee Chris Foy after United’s 0-0 draw with Cambridge in the FA Cup two and a half weeks ago, with United subsequently winning the replay.

'We knew in advance everything would be against us - but you have to survive,' the 63-year-old said after his side were forced to a rematch by a stubborn Cambridge performance at Abbey Stadium.

Van Gaal made comments about referee Chris Foy after his side were forced into a replay against the U's 

'And then you have seen the referee - its always the same. Everywhere I have coached these games, and I have coached them with other clubs, it's always the same.

'What was wrong with the referee? You can give your own opinion, I can't give mine.'

The Manchester United manager said on Friday he would dispute the charge and was due to inform the FA by close of play on Monday. 

It is understood that Van Gaal will still do this and that he has merely been given an extra day by the FA after asking for more time to formalise his response.
