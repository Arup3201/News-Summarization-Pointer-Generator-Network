With the average wedding now setting couples back a staggering £18,000, thrifty brides are forever finding ways to cut costs.

A recent survey even revealed that midweek marriages are on the rise as cash-strapped British couples spurn expensive weekend weddings.

One high-street store is hoping to help brides in their quest to reduce the wedding bill by unveiling its debut wedding dress for the humble price of £59.99.

Would you get married in high street? H&M has just unveiled its first-ever wedding dress for £59.99

H&M, which is currently fronted by Miranda Kerr, has unveiled, what they describe as a 'glamorous 1930’s Hollywood inspired wedding dress.'

The white strapless floor-length dress has floral 
beaded embellishment at the neckline, a fitted waist and pleated 
skirt.

H&M say the dress will land in 
stores this month ahead of the summer wedding season.

A spokesperson for the brand said: 'We have been offering party dresses for quite some time and we felt that we wanted to be able to give our customer an opportunity to look great on her wedding day by offering this great and affordable wedding dress in our assortment.

'Everyone should be able to have a great and affordable wedding dress.'

Speaking about the budget dress, Pippa Vosper of The Wedding
 Editor said: 'I'm in two minds about a dress at £59. 
It's great to have the option for such an inexpensive dress, but a bride
 has to look like she's in the most special dress she will ever wear.

'I
 would like to see H&M expand on the range, with differing styles 
and options for slightly more luxurious fabrics, while still keeping the
 prices in the affordable H&M bracket.'

This isn't the first time a high street store has launched wedding dresses. Richard Nicoll designed a 
collection for Topshop in May 2012.

Speaking at the time, the designer said: 'I loved
 the idea of doing wedding dresses with Topshop because I wanted to 
offer a younger, cooler alternative to meringue culture, something 
special, but not precious, like my friends, something they would wear if
 they were getting married.'

We doubt Kim Kardashian will be rushing down to her local H&M ahead of her May wedding to Kanye West.
