Children should be banned from using mobile phones and iPads during at the dinner table, Nick Clegg said today.

Despite many parents relying on modern technology to keep youngsters quiet, the Deputy Prime Minister said meal times should be gadget-free.

And he lashed out at the ‘curse’ of colleagues in government who sit glued to iPhones and Blackberries during meetings ‘mumbling’.

Curse: Nick Clegg complained that modern technology was ruining meal times and meetings

The nation has been divided over 
mobile phone etiquette after 26-year-old Jo Clarke was told she would 
not be served in a Sainsbury’s branch in London until she ended her 
call.

Mr Clegg said he had a ‘sneaking sympathy’ for the checkout worker in Crayford, south east London.

He said it drove him ‘round the bend’ when people constantly had their ‘noses glued’ to smartphones and iPads.

The Lib Dem leader said he ‘strongly suspects’ he has spoken on a mobile while standing in a queue in a shop.

Complaint: The Deputy Prime Minister does not like people who keep checking their phones, as he was pictured doing near his home in May 2010

But he added: ‘If the customer was not responding, then the check-out woman couldn't do her job and she's perfectly entitled to ask “Well, do you want it or not?”.

‘I have a sneaking sympathy for her. But I understand Sainsbury's have to be on the side of their customers.’

He went on to reveal the strict mobile rule around the Clegg dinner table, despite grumbling from his three sons.

Speaking on his LBC 97.3 radio phone-in, he said: ‘It’s not actually formally banned but we don’t ever use them. 

‘Miriam
 and I have quite a … I wouldn’t say it was rigid it sounds far too 
Victorian.  But we kind of really value sitting with all of us, our 
three boys, together.

‘The oldest is already constantly saying “oh god, I don’t want to be here”. 

‘But no, I actually really do think you know the old saying, families that eat together stay together. 

‘I think it’s incredibly important to spend time.  Don’t have your iPads and your mobile phones.’

Talking point: Shopper Jo Clarke, 26, received an apology from Sainsbury's after being told to hang up the phone before she used the check out at a store in Crayford, London

David Cameron has previously boasted of being addicted to his iPad, including playing games such as Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.

It was not clear if Mr Clegg was referring to the Prime Minister when he ranted about people not paying attention in meetings.

‘I have sat in numerable meetings where people don’t look each other in the eye,’ Mr Clegg said.

‘ They don’t appear to be paying attention.  They sort of half dip in and dip out of conversations.  They spend their whole time with their nose glued to their hand held appliance. 

‘It drives me round the bend. Having said that, I’m sure I, from time to time pick up my Blackberry.

‘But I just think we have this real tendency where people are supposed to talk to each other, they don’t actually talk to each other, they mumble at each other whilst actually communicating with their own hand held appliances.’
