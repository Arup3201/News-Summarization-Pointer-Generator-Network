With superstar singer Lionel as her father and fashion royalty Nicole as a sister, there was little doubt that Sofia Richie was destined for stardom.

The 16-year-old, who was born and raised in Los Angeles, has already been snapped up by top modelling agency, Select Model Management.

The agency, which has Agyness Deyn, Irina Shayk, Jessica Hart and Pixie Geldof on its books, predict great things for the youngster.

Fashion's new darling? Lionel Richie's daughter Sofia has been snapped up by Select Model Management and proves her worth in these new shots 

Posing in a set of editorial shots for Fault magazine, Sofia proves her worth as a fledgling model. 

No doubt she will join Kate Moss' sister Lottie, Jude Law's son Rafferty and Kim Kardashian's sister Kendall in the next generation of professional posers. 

Sofia is already obsessed with all things fashion and spends her free time devouring the glossy pages of Vogue, CR magazine and Jalouse.

Down-to-earth: Sofia says her favourite hobby is playing ping pong and she loves watching Game Of Thrones in her free time

She takes fashion advice from her perennially stylish older sister, Nicole Richie, and whenever she needs something to wear, she simply raids her closet.

She cites the 'amazing' Olsen twins as her style icons and is a huge fan of their brand, The Row. With such a blessed upbringing, it's little wonder her favorite designers are Chanel, Givenchy, Balmain. 

She has already had a taste of showbiz; her sister secured her a cameo role in Samantha Ronson's music video, she called Michael Jackson her godfather and his daughter, Paris, is one of her best friends.

However, proving that she's just like any other teen, Sofia says her favourite hobby is playing ping pong and she loves watching Game Of Thrones in her free time. Indeed, her hair was inspired by Khaleesi.

The svelte young star stays in shape by practicing yoga and  taking boxing classes and when asked if she is compliant or a rebel she responded: 'a rebel all day long!'.

The teen previously admitted her father is stricter with her because of her 33-year-old sister Nicole, who Lionel adopted in 1983 with his first wife Brenda Harvey.

She told ELLE magazine: 'My dad [Lionel Richie] is more strict because of my sister. I feel like now he's on the preventative side.

'It's not like I'm doing anything bad, but he went through all that with Nicole, so he's just strict to prevent it from happening again.' 

This is just the first of many fashion shoots for Sofia, who will be gracing the pages of Fault and Unleash'd magazine next year. Should Kendall Jenner be worried?
