Recovering: Nelson Mandela is recovering from an operation to remove gallstones, carried out in a private clinic in Pretoria

Nelson Mandela is recovering in hospital after having an operation to remove gallstones.

The 94-year-old, who was South Africa's first black president, underwent the surgery at a private clinic in Pretoria.

He had previously been hospitalised last Saturday, suffering from a lung infection.

South Africans have been worried about 
Mr Mandela's health since he was airlifted to the clinic from his home 
in Qunu in the Eastern Cape.

While in hospital, tests revealed the 
presence of gallstones and it was decided the operation would be carried
out after he had recovered.

A government statement said: 'This 
morning, 15 December 2012, the former president underwent a procedure 
via endoscopy to have the gall stones removed. The procedure was 
successful and (Mr Mandela) is recovering.'

Gallstones are an accumulation of 
crystals in the gall bladder. The condition can become life-threatening 
because of the risks of secondary infections such as pancreatitis.

Mr Madela's wife previously caused concern when she said his trademark 'spirit and sparkle' was waning.

Graca Machel told a South African television news channel that it was painful to see her 94-year-old husband 'fading.'

'I mean, this spirit and this sparkle, you see that somehow it's fading,' she told eNews Central Africa.

Mr Mandela's grand-daughter Ndileka told the same news channel that the anti-apartheid icon has come to accept his condition.

'He has come to accept that it's part of growing old, and it's part of humanity as such', she said.

'At some point you will dependent on someone else, he has come to embrace it'.

The pair's comments were the first official remarks by his family since the former President was rushed to hospital.

The anti-apartheid leader is particularly susceptible to illness because of his age and his 27 years in prison, though medics say he is responding well to treatment.

He fought off a similar lung infection in 2011 and once contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned.

Medical experts say respiratory 
illnesses like pneumonia striking a man his age are a serious matter 
that require care and monitoring.

His ongoing hospitalisation 
has caused growing concern in South Africa, a nation of 50 million 
people that largely reveres him for being the nation's first 
democratically elected president who sought to bring the country 
together after centuries of racial division.

Tests at 1 
Military Hospital near South Africa's capital, Pretoria, detected the 
lung infection, presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj previously said in a statement.

'Madiba is receiving appropriate 
treatment and he is responding to the treatment,' Maharaj said, 
referring to Mr Mandela by his clan name as many do in South Africa as a
sign of affection.

In January 2011, Mr Mandela was 
admitted to a Johannesburg hospital for what officials initially 
described as tests but what turned out to be an acute respiratory 
infection.

The chaos that followed his stay at 
that public hospital, with journalists and members of the public surrounding it 
and entering wards, saw the South African military take charge of his 
care and the government control the information about his health.

In recent days many in the press and 
public have complained about the lack of concrete details that the 
government has released about the former president's condition.

They had not divulged why he had been
flown over 500 miles from his rural home to undergo the urgent tests 
prompting many to fear the worst.

Over the weekend the South African 
Sunday Times newspaper quoted a source as saying 'he has not been 
talking. He is not looking good'.

The country's defence 
minister visited the Nobel Peace Prize winner at the Pretoria military 
hospital in which he is being treated.

Afterwards Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula 
echoed the official, placatory message, telling reporters that Mr 
Mandela was 'doing very, very well'.

She added: 'It is important to keep 
him in our prayers and also to be as calm as possible and not cause a 
state of panic because I think that is not what all of us need.'

Mr Mandela has a history with lung 
problems. He fell ill with tuberculosis in 1988 toward the tail-end of 
his prison years, after he had been moved from the notorious Robben 
Island and to another jail to ease the apartheid government's efforts to
negotiate with him about a possible release.

After being taken to a Cape Town hospital, a doctor told him he had water in his lungs.

Mr Mandela initially refused to believe the doctor, he wrote in his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom.

‘With a hint of annoyance, (the 
doctor) said, “Mandela, take a look at your chest,”’ Mr Mandela 
recounted. ‘He pointed out that one side of my chest was actually larger
than the other.’

Surgeons immediately cut into his 
chest and removed two litres (half a gallon) of liquid from his lungs, 
which tested positive for tuberculosis.

Doctors at the time suggested Mr Mandela contracted the disease from his damp prison cell.

About 1.4 million people worldwide 
die each year from tuberculosis, a bacterial infection which can stay 
dormant for years. It also can cause permanent lung damage, though in 
his autobiography Mr Mandela says doctors caught it in time.

However, tuberculosis can return to 
trouble those previously infected, properly treated or not, and previous
damage could have been missed, Openshaw said.

Openshaw, who has not seen Mr 
Mandela's medical records and spoke generally about treating patients, 
said pneumonia is the most likely respiratory illness to affect an 
elderly person, though others can strike as well.

Mr Mandela was a leader in the 
struggle against racist white rule in South Africa and once he emerged 
from 27 years in prison in 1990, he won worldwide acclaim for urging 
reconciliation.

He won South Africa's first truly 
democratic elections in 1994, serving one five-year term. The Nobel 
laureate later retired from public life to live in his remote village of
Qunu, in the Eastern Cape, and last made a public appearance when his 
country hosted the 2010 World Cup soccer tournament.

Mr Mandela disengaged himself from 
the country's politics over the last decade but continued campaigning 
against AIDS. He has grown increasing frail in recent years.

He went seven weeks of radiation therapy for prostate cancer in 2001, ultimately beating the disease.

In February he underwent minor surgery to determine the cause of abdominal pain. 
Mr Mandela's last foreign visitor is believed to have been US Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton, who had lunch with him and his wife, Graca 
Machel, at their Qunu home in August.

In 2011 Mr Mandela's close friend Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu described him as being 'frail'.

The churchman said: 'We want him to remain forever, but you know... anything can happen.'
