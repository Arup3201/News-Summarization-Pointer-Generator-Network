No one can cane it like Kate Moss. The woman can't even stick a detox in a luxury health resort in Turkey for more than three days.

If she isn't entertaining fellow passengers on easyJet, she's bouncing around on the beach, fag in one hand, cocktail in the other, ricocheting from party to party.

If there was any justice in this world, she'd be well on her way to joining Marianne Faithfull in the pantheon of had-it-all-but-partied-it-away great ex-beauties of our time. Instead of which she still looks better than most women half her age, even when she's at her roughest.

Following Kate's lead: The model manages to look good the morning after the night before

Those of us who aren't species supermodel have to try a little harder. I have a friend who swears by a mouthful of ice cubes first thing in the morning: wakes you up and de-puffs, apparently.

My dentist, meanwhile, has some rather more scientific advice: always use ibuprofen for a hangover, never paracetamol: apparently the latter is processed via the liver, which has enough on its plate breaking down the excess alcohol. The ibuprofen, by contrast, leaves via the kidneys.

So it's true: the best way of preventing a hangover is a large glass of water and two Nurofen before bed.

Personally, I swear by milk thistle. I take a course of it twice a year, once in the summer and once at Christmas, and I'm convinced it makes a difference. Well, it must do, because I had my liver function checked recently and it's tip top - despite the fact that I'm 2st overweight and partial to the odd G&T.

A happy liver is key to most things. It will clear up dark circles under the eyes, and also stop your skin from taking on that grey-ish tinge that’s associated with the occasional bout of excess.

It also helps things enormously if you choose your poison. Did you know, for example, that the paler the drink, the gentler the hangover? That's because dark-coloured drinks - red wine, whisky, rum - contain higher levels of congeners, which are the natural by-products of fermentation, and give you hangovers.

Nutritionist Amelia Freer takes the sensible holistic approach. Her response is to work on building up reserves from within through sustained healthy eating before, after and during your vacation.

Make sure your holiday diet doesn't just consist of a packet of salt and vinegar crips and a slice of pizza. Eat plenty of dark greens (spinach, kale, broccoli etc), onions, garlic, tomatoes and peppers. All these encourage the production of glutathione in the body, a powerful antioxidant that helps support the liver.

The other problem with having that extra tipple is that it increases inflammation in the body. So avoid inflammatory foods such as wheat and sugar, and fill up on things like avocado, oily fish and nuts.

As to make-up, my biggest problem is usually bleariness from not taking off my mascara properly, sleeping in my contact lenses (I always know it's been a good night when I wake up able to see properly) or stabbing myself in the eye with the cotton wool.

For this there is really no better remedy than Optrex straight from the fridge. Cucumbers work, of course; but if that's not practical, try Boots Cucumber Eye Gel (£1): very effective and quite possibly cheaper in the long run.

If you've got time, a little lie-down with an Alka-Seltzer and a cooling eye mask works wonders (also for hay fever sufferers): try the Aqua Eye Mask (£6) from Body Shop.

If you're beach-bound, you probably won't feel like caking much on the day after - Kate certainly doesn't bother. A quick slap in the chops with something invigorating always helps, though, to wit Liz Earle's Cleanse & Polish Hot Cloth Cleanser (from £8.50). It's the eucalyptus in this that does it for me.

Finally, for those with deep pockets, Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream (£70) is the actual product that the actual Kate Moss uses.

Tilbury being Moss's go-to make-up artist, she has plenty of experience of being handed a weary, worn-out party girl and transforming her into a hot-to-trot supermodel.

Then it's just a case of a large pair of sunnies, a slick of lippie, a truck-load of attitude - and off you go. Mind that step, now.

The all-in-one hair wash is back

12-in-one: Grow Gorgeous is a cleanser and conditioner with a host of other effects

'Take two bottles into the shower? Not me... I just want to Wash And Go!' Remember that? You must be as old as me then.

Vidal Sassoon's all-in-one shampoo and conditioner was the archetypal product for the yuppie decade. After all, if Gordon Gekko thought lunch was for wimps, imagine what he would have made of hair conditioner?

Thirty years on, and the one-bottle hair trend is back. Only this time it's known as co-washing. Sounds like one of those Gwyneth Paltrow-style euphemisms; in fact it's just short for conditioning wash.

Essentially, it's washing your hair in a souped-up conditioner in order to remove dirt and grease without stripping the hair of its natural oils.

African and Afro-Caribbean women will probably already be familiar with it, as will those with very curly hair. But in this age of straighteners and curlers and rainbow colours, co-washing has become more mainstream, as it offers the ideal solution to the difficulties of caring for over-treated hair.

Nevertheless, it's best suited to thick or curly hair, although if your mop is colour treated, or if it's had a lot of sun exposure this year, you may also want to give it a go.

If you like that audible feeling of squeaky cleanliness, though, avoid.

And if you suffer from dandruff or psoriasis, check with your dermatologist beforehand.

CRUSH... Words like 'miracle' and 'flawless' are often bandied around in the beauty industry, but in the case of Yves Saint Laurent Fusion Ink Foundation, they're justified. £30.50, www.yslbeauty.co.uk.

FAIL... Do we really need to see reality star Millie Mackintosh's facemask, below? Enough already with the selfies!

If you're one of those sporty types who washes their hair daily, try to limit your co-washes to three a week, and use a gentle, sulphate-free shampoo in-between.

And be careful if you have hair-extensions: the added oils may loosen the connections.

Needless to say, the number of co-washing products on the market is growing almost hourly. Here's the pick of the current crop...

Grow Gorgeous: A new 12-in-one cleanser/conditioner, no less, promising volume as well as shine, softness, smoothness and a host of other miraculous effects. £19.29, Boots.

Ojon Rare Blend Moisture-Rich Cleansing Conditioner: Sulphate and glycerin free, and enriched with coconut oil for extra de-tangling. £18.50, ojon.co.uk.

Mizani True Textures Cleansing Cream Conditioning Curl Wash: Designed for curly hair, it will also work on very dry tresses. Leaves hair feeling very soft and light. £9.99, lookfantastic.co.uk.
