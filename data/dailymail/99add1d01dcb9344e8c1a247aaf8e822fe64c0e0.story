Carbon monoxide poisoning is to blame for the death of an 11-year-old boy found in a Boone, North Carolina hotel room on Saturday and the deaths of an elderly couple found in the same room almost two months ago.

The body of 11-year-old Jeffrey Lee Williams of Rock Hill, South Carolina was found shortly after noon on Saturday, along with his mother, Jeannie Williams, 49, who was rushed to a hospital in critical condition.

Boone Police Chief Dana Crawford told reporters that 'a presumptive test indicated elevated level of carbon monoxide in the room.'

Toxicology tests have confirmed that the deaths of Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning

An autopsy on the boy's body found that he died from asphyxia - a severe lack of oxygen.

The boy and his mother had been staying in room 225 at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza at 840 E. King St. in Boone.

Two month ago the bodies of Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, of Longview, Wash., were found in the same room.

Autopsies conducted soon after the couple died had been incomplete, but full-blown toxicology tests only concluded this week have confirmed that their deaths were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning.

The hotel is currently closed as authorities conduct an investigation into what happened in room 225, which is located directly above a room housing a natural gas heater for the hotel's indoor pool.

A March 6 Watauga County Health Department inspectors report, obtained by the Charlotte Observer, showed the pool’s pump was not approved by an industry standards group. The report also found the pool’s chemical and equipment room needed better ventilation.

'This needs to be corrected ASAP,' wrote the county health inspector.

Such heaters can produce carbon monoxide, an odorless colorless gas that can cause illness and death.

The boy and his mother had gone to Boone to pick up his sister from a mountain camp. The mom, Jeannie Williams, 49, has awoken from a medically induced coma but has no memory of what happened.

'We support a full investigation into 
the cause of this horrible tragedy and we will not rest until we are 
satisfied with the outcome,' said the family in a statement. 'The loss of Jeffrey from our family is 
immeasurable.'

A family friend told CNN: 'If you had this happen one time, why in hell didn't they do something about it?'

The hotel will remain closed by police until at least Wednesday, when inspectors from the State Board of Examiners of Plumbing, Heating and Fire Sprinkler Contractors are due to arrive.

'The health and safety of guests who stay at our hotel is our number one priority. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of those involved. We are cooperating fully with authorities who are investigating this truly tragic incident,' said a hotel spokesperson.

Doug Jenkins, a son of deceased couple, is said to be consulting with an attorney.

Three people have died in the last couple of months after staying in room 225 at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza in Boone, North Carolina
