New Zealand fly-half Dan Carter made his long-awaited return to professional rugby as he came on as a second-half substitute for the Crusaders in their 16-9 loss to the Hurricanes.

The 100-cap All Black has not played all year after being granted a six-month sabbatical by the New Zealand Rugby Union at the end of 2013.

However, he came on as a 47th-minute substitute for the injured Colin Slade, who suffered concussion in the loss.

Return: All Blacks fly-half Dan Carter will made his comeback from a six-month sabbatical on Saturday

Pedigree: Carter has 100 All Blacks caps and is the world record international points scorer with 1,440

Comeback: Carter came on in the 47th-minute for the Crusaders as they lost 16-9 to the Hurricanes

Age: 32

Clubs: Canterbury (2002-), Crusaders (2003-), Perpignan (2008-09)

Nation: New Zealand (2003-)

International caps: 100

International points: 1,440

International tries: 17

All Black legend Carter was unable to make an impact though, failing to score or help overturn the deficit as the Crusaders lost top spot in the New Zealand conference as they search for an eighth Super Rugby title.

The 32-year-old - who is the world record international points scorer with 1,440 -Â  will target the All Blacks' first Investec Rugby Championship match of 2014 for his New Zealand comeback.

They face Australia in Sydney on August 16, looking to break their own record for consecutive Test victories by winning their 18th in a row.

The All Blacks' 3-0 series win over England this month ensured they equalled their own record of 17 straight victories.

New Zealand captain Richie McCaw took a similar 'sabbatical' to Carter's last year before returning to the international fold.

Rest: New Zealand captain Richie McCaw was allowed a similar sabbatical last season by the NZRU
