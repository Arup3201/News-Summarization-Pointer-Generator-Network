Norman Lamb recently highlighted the importance of developing new services and mobile phone apps to help young people with depression and mental health problems

Minister for Care Norman Lamb recently revealed that he is working towards developing more apps to help young people suffering with mental health problems and depression.  

He said in an interview with the times: 'We’ve got a taskforce looking at how we can modernise children and young people’s mental health and that’s one of the key elements to it.”

'If you’re a teenager and your world revolves around digital access, we must make sure you get access to therapy online. So these programmes are being developed.'

But one such app already exists; Buddy App is a digital tool which supports therapy services. It allows users to text daily updates of how their feeling. 

The can then use the analysis tool to reassess how they are feeling and can set the app to send goal reminders via text message. 

Lastly the app allows users to set reminders for appointments and agendas so that they can take control over elements of their life.  

The app was created by Sidekick Studios a company which is passionate about using design and technology to tackle social problems and they work closely with many NHS healthcare providers.

Femail spoke to Kat Cormack who explained that for the Sidekick team it was important to create something that would really help people. 

She said: 'Buddy has a few aims, first and foremost we want to help people. We’re a social enterprise so for us it’s about social impact, making a real, qualitative difference to people’s lives.

'There are now more mobile phones than people in the UK and we want people using NHS services to benefit from really cheap, accessible technology like SMS messaging.' 

Kat told us she even uses the app herself: 'I’m a service user myself and I think apps and other technologies have a huge role to play in improving mental health and wellbeing. 

'Personally I’m using Buddy in my own treatment and over the last five months it’s really helped me to stay on track with my recovery. 

'It’s amazing that something as simple as a couple of texts messages can make such a big difference.'

The Buddy App allows users to log their feelings 

Users of the Buddy App can send text messages describing their feelings, this helps them to assess how they are doing during the day

But she agrees that the app should be used in conjunction with other therapies. 'We don’t want to replace clinicians, we know that they have a huge impact on people’s lives. 

'Research shows that it’s actually not the type of therapy you have but the relationship with your clinician that has the biggest effect on treatment efficacy. What we want to do is support clinicians to make their work even better.' 

In his interview Lamb revealed that there are more apps being developed but that it is important to remember when testing them that every young sufferer is different.

'What I want to achieve is a much more seamless service that allows you access online, face to face or over the telephone, whichever is appropriate.' 

'These platforms are evidence-based so the risk is very low that they’re not appropriate. Some people may need more than that so you have to have access to a gradation of different type of service,' he said.

When using the Buddy App you can log feelings about anything from how you're feeling that day to things you've got planned

Buddy will text you to remind you of appointments and meetings on your agenda 

Femail spoke to Lucie Russell, Director of media and campaigns at the charity Young Minds which is committed to improving the mental health of children and young people. 

Lucie agreed with Norman and Kat that apps can be a positive way to help some young people with their issues.

She said: 'What we need is a plethora of services both online and off. But I do think online and app support can be very positive for young people especially we find that they do interact a lot online, it's where they feel comfortable. 

'Sometimes young people can be scared and or feel intimidated about phoning their doctor whereas online there are able to engage more freely.  

'What there does need to be though is some regularity and I would say that the online support, whilst very useful, should never take the place of face to face therapies.

'Apps should always lead on to phone or face to face support, working as a sign post for young people and enabling them to get the help they need.

'If the NHS plan to work on apps the most important thing is that they speak to the young people, to those who have the first hand experience, so that they can work out what sort of services they're looking for.'

According research by Young Minds one in 10 children and young people aged five to 16 suffer from a diagnosable mental health disorder.

The number of those aged 15 to 16 with depression doubled between the 1980's and the 2000's with nearly 80,000 children and young people suffering from severe depression.

If you do feel suicidal and need to speak to someone, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or go to samaritans.org Alternatively, talk to your GP - if you don't get the help you want, go to another doctor.
