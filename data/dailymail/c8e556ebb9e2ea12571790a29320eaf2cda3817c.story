Olympic skiier Gus Kenworthy has been reunited with a family of dogs that he found in Sochi during the Games but revealed that a second pup died since arriving in the United States on Wednesday.

Kenworthy appeared on the Today Show Friday morning with his friend Robin Macdonald and three of the dogs- Mama, Jake and Mishka.

When the silver medalist slopeskiier first met the dogs during the Olympic Games, there were three others in the mix, and though it was announced that one died earlier this week just days before the crew headed back to America, another died since then.

Bringing the dogs home: Gus Kenworthy and his friend Robin Macdonald spoke to Matt Lauer and Tamron Hall about the grueling process of trying to get the family of dogs back to the states with their legal papers

The pup called Sochi died before Macdonald left Russia, and it is unclear which of the two others- Stryder or Rosa- died since then.

'It was a lot more difficult than we thought it would be,' Kenworthy said on Today.

He said how Macdonald, a friend of his who was working as a photographer at the Games, agreed to stay on in Russia after the Games to allow time for the legal paperwork to go through, but ended up staying longer than predicted.

'We expected him to be there two or three extra days and he was there for a month,' Kenworthy said.

Spooked: Today Show host Tamron Hall got nervous when she heard that the dogs have not been potty trained

Big debut: Kenworthy, who won a silver medal in slopestyle skiing, and Macdonald have been regularly updating their Twitter accounts with photos of the dogs

'We encountered some government roadblocks when we were there. A politician claimed that (the dogs) were his,' Macdonald said.

During the legal squabbling, Macdonald was unable to get the dogs the medical treatment that they needed to treat their malnourishment and other threats to life.

The plight of strays in Russia gained an international audience during the Olympics as thousands of dogs roamed the streets and interacted with the tourists.

'One of the strange things in Sochi is they're very friendly and people feed them and take care of them- they just don't bring them into their homes,' Macdonald said.

Before the worst: Since this Tweet was posted on Wednesday, one of the five dogs died

Bath time: He shared this photo of Mishka and Jake getting a rinse down on Thursday, the day before the Today Show appearance

Now the dogs that made it back alive are headed for homes of their own.

In earlier interviews, 22-year-old Kenworthy said that he would be taking Rosa and another dog, Mama- the mother of the clan- will go to Kenworthy's mother, and another will be going to Kenworthy's brother's family.

Kenworthy said that they worked with Humane Society International to get the paperwork and medical testing done and now have hopes of establishing easier ways for future visitors to Russia to adopt strays from abroad, giving future World Cups and Games as times when may be convenient.

Too soon: Gus Kenworthy's would-be adopted dog 'Sochi', seen here with Kenworthy's friend Robin Macdonald, died on March 9 ahead of the scheduled trip back to the US

Puppy love: Kenworthy brought some social media attention to the stray dogs in Sochi after posing for pictures with them during the Games

Macdonald posted photos of the dog's crates on Wednesday showing them at the airport on their way back to the U.S.

He later updated that all five of his travel companions made it through the flight, though only three appeared on Today and they confirmed that one had died since Wednesday.

The pups have resulted in a great deal of attention for Kenworthy, the 22-year-old who helped the U.S. sweep the slopestyle event with his silver contribution.

He credited Macdonald with being the one to alert him to the particularly photogenic stray family.

'There were a lot of strays there, but the [ones that I adopted] were living outside the media center. My friend Robin who was out there doing media stuff during the Games saw them and sent me a photo of them because he knows Iâ€™m obsessed with dogs,' Kenworthy told Elle.
