A toddler in China falls into shot at great speed and smashes into a parked car but somehow manages to survive in this alarming footage.

The poster of the video on Newsflare, China Recorder, says the child was aged three and fell from the third floor of a building in Kunming, the capital and largest city in Yunnan Province.

The CCTV security video is over in a flash but the drama is packed in.

A small child falls into shot, apparently from a third-floor window, in this CCTV footage posted online

The child, said to be aged three, hits a parked black car with a sickening thud 

For a moment the child lies still on the footpath, and only one ending seems possible

The child hits the black car with a sickening thud and for a moment lays prone on the footpath.

The kid almost immediately rises to his or her feet, but clearly not in good shape loses balance and falls over again.   

But the little one rises quickly to his or her feet, although on the first loses balance and falls over

But the recovery happened so quickly that the toddler is soon up again and scurrying away

However, despite appearing quite groggy still, the child rises again straight away and takes a few steps away from the camera. The brave little one then turns towards the camera and scurries away. 

The poster saying 'little abrasions' were the only injuries suffered.
