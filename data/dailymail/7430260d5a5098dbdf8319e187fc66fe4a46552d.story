When a man in breach of his restraining order gave police the slip on foot through the dark streets of Birmingham, he probably fancied his chances of getting away.

What he hadn't banked on was coming up against marathon running policewoman PC Hannah Graham.

The 31-year-old, seven years his senior, pursued the man for over half a mile just after 11pm on New Year's Eve before he ran out of breath and gave up.

The 24-year-old man was spotted loitering in the garden of his former partner's home in Birmingham just after 11pm on New Year's Eve.

Using a 'bleep' alarm the woman alerted officers patrolling nearby
in dedicated Domestic Abuse Response Vehicles as part of West Midlands Police's
campaign to protect victims.

As officers closed in, the man fled but PC Hannah Graham, a keen
runner with London and Edinburgh Marathon medals to her name, chased
him down and helped make an arrest.

PC Graham, whose best marathon time is three hours and 55 minutes, said: 'Initially he was hiding in the back garden but then bolted when he spotted our torch lights.

'I chased him along three streets before he gave up, we'd
only been running for about half a mile, though it was more of a sprint rather
than marathon pace.

'He was quick but he burnt out quickly because he didn't have
the stamina. He gave up but I didn't.

'I'm in training for the Loch Ness Marathon later this year
though so it's all good training.

'I train three or four times a week and I take fitness
training really seriously.

The man was later charged with two counts of harassment.

Inspector
 Kim Madill from West Midlands Police’s Public Protection Unit said: 
'The dedicated domestic abuse patrol cars were available across the 
region and meant we were able to respond swiftly to any incidents.

'We were able to offer support and advice to many sufferers and made several arrests.

'The
 campaign focused on the festive period but, of course, people shouldn’t
 tolerate domestic abuse at any time of year. Domestic abuse can be 
emotional, psychological, sexual, financial or physical; we want 
sufferers to know help is only a phone-call away – police can take swift
 action to protect them and their family and, through support groups 
like Women’s Aid, victims can take positive action to turn their life 
around.'
