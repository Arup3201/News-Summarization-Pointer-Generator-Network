Louis Smith went from ‘fat boy to skinny boy’ to Commonwealth champion in less than seven months and declared he was more in love with gymnastics than ever after a historic day for England, with their men and women winning team titles.

Smith said he had ‘proved a point’ after England won despite being a man down for most of Tuesday afternoon. Sam Oldham was carried from the competition floor by the team physiotherapist and left the arena in a wheelchair after suffering a suspected broken ankle.

The women also overcame physical travails. Becky Downie was in tears as she battled through the pain of a twisted ankle to complete her beam routine, a vital performance on the way to a score of 167.555 that clinched England’s first team victory since 1994.

‘The men’s team winning the gold medal earlier in the afternoon gave us a boost,’ said Downie.

Smith, 25, was competing for the first time since coming out of retirement. He had to perform a salsa, a Charleston and a shirtless Showdance to get his hands on his most recent piece of major hardware on the final evening of Strictly Come Dancing.

A blockbuster pommel horse and a solid routine on the parallel bars over two days of competition was his contribution to a team score of 266.804, which comfortably won England the title for the first time since 2002.

It was a first Commonwealth gold for Max Whitlock — who qualified in first for today’s all-around final — Kristian Thomas and 18-year-old Nile Wilson, who was making his international debut.

Smith, who retired after winning silver in the pommel horse and team bronze at the London Olympics, returned to his gym in Huntingdon only last December after 18 months enjoying the trappings of his celebrity status.

‘How easy was it to come back from being a fat boy to a skinny boy? Not very, gymnastics is a hard sport and if you’re out of shape it’s even harder,’ said Smith.

‘I think everyone was waiting to see if I have still got it. I have to prove myself because everyone else has been training since London. I am the one who took a break.’

Although Smith — who is targeting the Rio Olympics — was overlooked for the European Championships, he insisted he didn’t regret taking time out to pursue interests outside gymnastics.

‘It’s the best thing I have ever done because I have fallen back in love with the sport,’ he said. ‘You kind of lose your way a bit with sponsors and appearances. To fight my way back and get to where I am shows how much I am enjoying it.’

Smith may be the most famous member of the England team, but it was Whitlock who was the most consistently impressive. He nailed his vault with a score of 15.733, overwhelming the best in the field.

On the parallel bars, he held his body aloft and motionless for  several seconds before spinning through the air and landing as if his feet were superglued to the mat. 

‘It’s a fabulous feeling and a brilliant stepping stone to Rio,’ said Whitlock. ‘British gymnastics is just getting better and better because the juniors can look up to the seniors and see what they are doing. Juniors like Nile are coming up and looking amazing.’

Wilson 
first forayed into gymnastics as a clumsy four-year-old whose parents 
Sally and Neil took him to a club in Leeds to ‘learn how to fall’. He 
said: ‘It’s been a weird experience going from being the captain of the 
juniors to the baby.’

Another
 youngster, Claudia Fragapane, 16, was the star of the women’s victory 
over second-placed Australia. Her sensational floor and beam routine 
helped open the gap between England and Australia from 1.5 points 
overnight to six. Fragapane beamed as she collected her first major gold
 medal alongside Downie, Ruby Harrold, Hannah Whelan and Kelly Simm.

Oldham,
 wearing a moon boot, was lifted on to the podium by his team-mates 
Smith and Thomas at the almost sold-out Hydro Arena. His Games are over,
 a rare sad note on a sensational afternoon for English gymnastics.
