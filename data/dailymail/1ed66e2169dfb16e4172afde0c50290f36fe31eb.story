A farmer has been cleared of manslaughter following the death of a walker in an attack by his bull.

Paul Waterfall had denied manslaughter by gross negligence after Roger Freeman was attacked as he walked with his wife on a footpath across the farmer’s land in 2010.

Prosecutors said a bull belonging to Farmer Waterfall attacked and killed 63-year-old Mr Freeman and that the farmer had known the animal posed a ‘deadly risk’.

Mr and Mrs Freeman, who were married for 42 years, were experienced ramblers

Mr Waterfall had denied knowing the bull was aggressive or that it posed a risk to members of the public.

A jury of eight men and four women took just over two and a half hours to find the 39-year-old dairy farmer not guilty following a four-week trial at Nottingham Crown Court.

There were sighs of relief today from family and friends of the farmer.

Following the verdict, Judge Gregory Dickinson QC told the court: ‘Whatever the verdict, I have no doubt all the jury felt enormous sympathy for Mrs Freeman and for family and friends.

‘I express my sympathies and condolences to the family, who have been through a horrible ordeal.’

The judge also criticised the time it took to charge Mr Waterfall following the incident.

The farmer was charged last year following Mr Freeman’s death four years ago.

Judge Dickinson said: ‘I struggle to understand how it took so long as to come to a decision to charge.

‘The Crown Prosecution Service should look very carefully at the history of this case to find out what lessons can be learned.’

Mr and Mrs Freeman were walking the 15 miles from Nottingham to Loughborough when the incident took place in this field in Stanford-on-Soar on the Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire border

The judge also said the case questioned the importance of leaving health and safety issues to self-regulation.

Mr and Mrs Freeman, who were married for 42 years, were experienced ramblers and were walking the 15 miles from Nottingham to Loughborough when the incident took place around 4.30pm on November 12, 2010 in Stanford-on-Soar on the Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire border.

The couple, who had seen cattle in the field, carried on walking on the public footpath across Mr Waterfall’s field when Mr Freeman was attacked.

The court heard the farmer’s bull, Moonriver Zac Pi, was in the field with a number of cows of different breeds.

Prosecutors claimed it was the bull who attacked Mr Freeman, charging at him and tossing him in the air, and stripping him of his walking clothing.

Mrs Freeman, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, told police she believed a bull with 12in horns attacked her after she tried to defend her husband from the animal. However the trial heard the bull, known as Zac, did not have horns.

Zac was put down after the attack on Mr Freeman. Giving evidence during the trial, Mrs Freeman said she was no longer sure the animal that attacked her and her husband had horns.

Mrs Freeman, then 67, survived the attack by climbing over a fence and flagging down a passing motorist. The last thing she remembered hearing her husband say as he called on her to get help was: ‘I’m sorry my baby, I can’t get us out of this,’ she told Nottingham Crown Court.

Paramedics found Mr Freeman’s body in the field. He was wearing only his boots and underwear. A post-mortem examination revealed he suffered broken ribs, shoulders and upper arms, and fractures to his vertebra.

Mrs Freeman had to undergo surgery for chest and abdominal injuries.

Mrs Freeman needed hospital treatment for abdominal and chest injuries. Mr Waterfall told the court he had thought of Mr Freeman and his family every day since the fatal incident.

The father-of-two denied that Zac was aggressive and said it would have been culled if it had shown aggression.

After today’s hearing, Mr Waterfall declined to comment out of respect for the Freeman family but said he was relieved the case was over
