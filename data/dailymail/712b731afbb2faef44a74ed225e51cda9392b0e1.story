Not her idea: Teacher Natalia Sokolson Gordon insists the cop forced her to sext him

A New York City school investigator used his position of power to blackmail a teacher into sexting him so that she could keep her job, she claims.

Natalya Sokolson Gordon, who teaches fifth graders at PS 329 in Coney Island, says she felt she had no choice but to give in to Lawrence Scott's demands last year as he barraged her with hundreds of raunchy text messages and even a picture of his genitals.

Ms Gordon, 44, has filed formal complaints against the New York City Department of Education and Mr Scott, claiming that he groped her during a closed-door meeting and compelled her to send him naked pictures of herself in an attempt to save her job.

She told the New York Post: 'I feel so stupid for believing he would help me. I was scared I was going to lose my job. I felt I had no choice. He had my life in his hands.'

Mr Scott, who is married, admitted to the Post that he sent Ms Gordon raunchy messages, but denied assaulting her.

'She initiated it. I never forced anything on her. There was no quid pro quo,' he told the newspaper.

'Let me see those t***' Mr Scott demanded in one text message.

'So are u aggressive sexually?' he asked in another.

'Why wud you like me to be,' Ms Gordon replies.

'Yes,' Mr Scott responds.

In one series of exchanges, Mr Scott describes various sexual positions.

'Some may force u to scream,' he tells her.

Gordon was being investigated after 
supervisors charged last January that she grabbed several students and 
made a crude gesture while speaking about Principal Salema Marbury. She 
denies the allegations.

When
 Mr Scott first met with Ms Gordon about the case against her, he 
reportedly told her: 'â€œI have the power to get rid of you just like 
that' and snapped his fingers.

'Or I can make everything go away.'

Then, he started sending her sexually-explicit messages, Ms Gordon says.

For two and a half months, the pair exchanged text messages. Ms Godon frequently replied and admitted to sending him topless and bottomless photos.

She claims she felt she had to entertain the perverse gestures or she would lose her job.

In October, Ms Gordon turned over 275 pages of text messages to the Special Commissioner of Investigation. When Mrs Scott was confronted with the texts, he quit his 65,000-a-year job.

Ms Gordon says detectives from the Special Commissioner of Investigation launched an investigation of her because she replied to Mr Scott's texts for months before reporting him.
