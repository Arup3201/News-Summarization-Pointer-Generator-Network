Oprah's hitting the national airwaves and her return will likely brew some friendly rivalry with her best friend-turned-competitor Gayle King.

The 'queen of talk' is slated to be one of the star substitutes who will fill in for Good Morning America host Robin Roberts while she is out on medical leave of absence.

While parent company ABC is promoting Oprah's return as a ratings boost for the morning news show, her arrival will also pit her directly against her best friend Gayle King who is one of the hosts of 'CBS This Morning'.

Winfrey's return to network television comes as Roberts is leaving her anchor post due to a scheduled bone marrow transplant to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS.

The 51-year-old Good Morning America host opted to make Thursday her final show instead of her previously-scheduled Friday departure, saying that she needed to take care of her elderly mother in Mississippi.

There has been no exact timetable set regarding Roberts' return, The Huffington Post reports that the network is lining up high0--wattage replacements.

A majority of their cadre of stars come from within their own schedule, including regular guest hosts Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Barbara Walters, Elisabeth Vargas, and Amy Robach.

Switching chairs: Chris Rock has also been announced as one of the stars who will guest host in Robert's absense

Kelly Ripa, whose own show airs directly after Good Morning America, is also slated for the substitute roster.

In addition to their news contributors, the network will also pull from their entertainment division, with the cast of Modern Family leading the charge.

Rob Lowe and Chris Rock were also named in the line-up, though their connection to the network and the show is unclear as they both are involved with shows for rival channels NBC and FX respectively.

Out of them all, Oprah still reigns supreme, and the fact that GMA producers were able to get her to spent time away from her own fledgling network shows a remarkable get.

While the morning show will likely have a major boost from Winfrey's addition, GMA has been doing well on its own regardless, beating the Today show for the first time in 16 years earlier this summer.

That said, King's program on CBS remains in their consistent third place position behind NBC and ABC.

The departure of Roberts is not a sudden one, as she has been very vocal about her disease and the planned treatment ever since she announced her diagnosis on the show in June.

Her sister was found to be a perfect match as a donor for the disease which attacks blood cells and bone.

Roberts, who survived a breast cancer in 2007, said on GMA one of the toughest things she had to do was to move her dog, KJ, out of the house while she undergoes the surgery.

She met friends from Maine in Portsmouth, New Hampshire over the weekend and handed over KJ and added on her Twitter account that she 'Cried like a baby.'

Roberts previously said: 'KJ has been in my life almost 15 years. She's up in Maine now because when you have a bone marrow transplant you don't have an immune system for a while. And you're very susceptible to infection. And having a dog coming in and out ... that was really hard.'

Producers of GMA plan a segment called 'Robin's journey' to show viewers of where she stands with the illness.

Roberts told viewers last month that she was anticipating a medical leave in late August, though she had not set a specific date until the announcement on today's GMA.
