West Bromwich Albion caretaker manager Keith Downing showed his faith in Nicolas Anelka by starting the Frenchman against Newcastle after his controversial goal celebration last weekend. 

The former France striker paid tribute to French humourist Dieudonne M’bala M’bala by performing a ‘quenelle’ celebration.

Anelka’s decision to perform the anti-establishment salute – touching the right shoulder with the left hand while pointing the right arm towards the floor – has been met with derision as many believe the gesture, invented by Dieudonne, has anti-Semitic undertones.

The former Arsenal, Manchester City 
and Chelsea forward, who faces a lengthy ban subject to an FA 
investigation, has since said he will not perform the ‘quenelle’ again. 

The Baggies man scored his first goals since August 2011 at West Ham, netting twice in the 3-3 draw at Upton Park. 

And
Downing, filling in for Steve Clarke after the Scot’s sacking from the 
Midlands club, opted to reward the striker with another start at home to
Alan Pardew’s side.

Despite the stormed sparked by Anelka's celebration,West Brom edged a victory over the Toon with youngster Saido Berahino snatching the winning goal.
