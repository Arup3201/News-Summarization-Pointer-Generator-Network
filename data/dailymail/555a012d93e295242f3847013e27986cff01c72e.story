A Chinese villager who was desperate to become a grandfather has been arrested for buying a wife for his son, then reselling her to another family after realising she was infertile.

The man, known only as Xu, even tried to impregnate the 'daughter-in-law' himself after discovering his son had not slept with his wife a single time.

Xu is currently under arrest for human trafficking by the police of Lianyungang city in eastern China, according to the People's Daily Online.

Desperate for a grandchild, Xu (pictured) bought a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties

Xu and his son live outside Yancheng, a city of 1.6 million in eastern China.

Hoping for a grandchild to carry on the bloodline, he spent 12,000 yuan (£1,311) purchasing a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties, through a middleman at the beginning of 2014.

It's reported that the young bride, known only as Wang, is also mentally impaired.

Six months after Wang 'married' into the family, Xu discovered that the young couple had not slept together at all.

Desperate to have a 'grandson', Xu decided to have sex with her himself.

After spending six months trying to get Wang pregnant, he realised that the young bride was likely to be infertile. 

The wife (pictured), known as Wang, was resold to another family after failing to get pregnant

Worrying that Wang, whose mental health was getting worse, might be a drain to the family without 'any concrete contribution', Xu sold her off to another family through a middleman in his village for 10,000 yuan (£1,093). 

The astonishing incident only emerged after a regular home visit by the community policemen at Guanyun County.

The local policemen discovered the incident while paying a visit to the family who bought Wang from Xu

'We asked her (Wang) name and age, but she couldn't answer,' said Gao Ming, a policeman at Guanyun County police station.

This put Gao and his colleagues on alert and it took them two weeks to find out how Wang had been trafficked into the village.

'The whole thing is pathetic and detestable,' said Guo Jialun, head of the Guanyun County police station.

The police is currently trying to track down Wang's real family.
