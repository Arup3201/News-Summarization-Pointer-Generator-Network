Councils have been accused of imposing a ‘death tax’ on bereaved families by drastically increasing burial and cremation charges to balance their books.

The higher fees are hitting people when they are at their most vulnerable, according to undertakers.

The National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD) spoke out after a council in Suffolk introduced new charges that saw the cost of a burial plot rise by almost £1,000.

Councils have been accused of imposing a 'death tax' on bereaved families by drastically increasing burial and cremation charges

The cost of interment in the Suffolk Coastal District Council area rose from £420 to £688 while the exclusive right to a burial plot for 25 years increased almost three-fold from £460 to £1,355. Families wishing to bury the ashes of a loved one in a council-run cemetery now have to find £1,260 – more than five times the previous fee of £230.

Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis said: ‘Some town halls may be trying to impose a death tax on grieving families.’ 

Alan Slater, chief executive of the NAFD, said: ‘We are aware that numerous local authorities are making double-digit price rises to their burial and cremation charges or otherwise seeking to increase revenue from bereaved families.’

He said the London Borough of Lambeth increased its cremation fee by 38 per cent last year – after a 41 per cent hike in 2011.

‘There has been a 25 per cent increase at Sefton council in the North West in the past year,’ he added. ‘And there is a proposed  15 per cent increase in Dudley in the West Midlands.

MP Lorely Burt said: 'Local authorities must never balance their books on the backs  of the bereaved'

‘The London Borough of Greenwich has introduced a £73 charge simply to make any changes to a burial service, such as coffin size.

‘Councils are levying excessive fees on local people when they are at their most vulnerable.’

MP Lorely Burt, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Funerals and Bereavement, said: ‘Local
 authorities must never  balance their books on the backs  of the 
bereaved, many of whom are facing the worry of how to pay for the 
funeral on top of the grief and distress of losing a loved one.’

Mehboob
 Kahn, chairman of the Local Government Association’s Safer and Stronger
 Communities Board, said: ‘With funding for local government having been
 slashed in the past three years, councils have been forced to examine 
all their services carefully. Where services have been subsidised by 
council taxpayers previously, councils have had no choice but to review 
the fees they charge.’

Changes to council charges do  not affect burials in Church of England churchyards, where fees range from £260 to £286.

Ray
 Herring, leader of Suffolk Coastal District Council, said that the 
authority had increased its fees to correct years of under-charging, not
 to make a profit.
