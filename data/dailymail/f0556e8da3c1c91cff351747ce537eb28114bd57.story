Tragic: Brad Rothwell, 11, accidentally hanged himself trying to play a prank on his father and brother

A boy aged 11 accidentally killed himself when a practical joke went too far, an inquest heard.

Brad Rothwell regularly played tricks on his younger brother, Bret, which he filmed and uploaded to video sharing site YouTube.

But the youngster was found hanging in his bedroom after one of his pranks went tragically wrong.

His father, Bryn Rothwell, said Brad may have been preparing to play a joke on him and Bret, ten, who had been out running errands.

They discovered Brad on their return and immediately dialled 999, but he could not be saved.

Bolton Coroner Alan Walsh described the case as ‘unimaginably tragic’, adding: ‘Pranks can get out of hand – he wasn’t able to save himself.’

The tragedy happened on May 13 at the family home, in Atherton, near Wigan, two years after the youngsters lost their mother, Joanne, 44, to cancer.

Mr Rothwell, 55, a dental technician, said Brad had come home from school as normal and stayed behind while he and Bret went out to do a few deliveries for his work.

The pair had been gone for just over an hour.

He said: ‘As I pulled on to the drive I got a text from my girlfriend and Bret went inside.

‘As I was reading the text he came out and said, “Brad is pretending to kill himself”. I thought he was messing about but I dived upstairs and that’s when I saw him.’

Prank gone wrong: Brad's father said he arrived back at their home in Wigan, Greater Manchester, to find him hanging from the bunk bed

He lowered his son down and gave him 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before paramedics arrived, but Brad was 
declared dead at the scene.

Mr Rothwell, who was described by the 
coroner as an ‘exemplary father’, added: ‘[Brad] had done videos on 
YouTube, jumping out of wardrobes, scaring his brother. He would say to 
me, “Don’t tell him I’m upstairs” so he could jump out at Bret. It could
be another prank that he could have been thinking about.’

Brad had 
14 online videos, including one called ‘the best hidden jump’ which 
showed him jumping out of a wardrobe to startle his brother.

Mr Rothwell said he and his sons had received counselling following the death of his wife ten days before Christmas 2010.

Evidence: Brad's father Bryn Rothwell, left, told the court his son, right, would often film pranks he played on them and upload them to YouTube

She spent the last three months of her life at a hospice and Brad had visited her daily.

Although
the youngster, who was happy at school and had a wide circle of 
friends, rarely spoke about his mother, he was coping with her loss and 
had no reason to harm himself, Mr Rothwell added.

Police examined his
laptop and mobile phone, but neither revealed any evidence that he had 
researched taking his own life or had written a suicide note.

Tributes: Flowers, teddies and letters are left outside Fred Longworth High School in Atherton for Brad

Pathologist
Dr Jonathan Pearson confirmed Brad died by hanging and said: 
‘Sometimes people don’t understand how quickly they can lose control of
the situation – it can be seconds before they lose consciousness.’

Recording
a verdict of accidental death, Mr Walsh said Brad was ‘mischievous at 
times’ and ‘prone to unexpected behaviour to gain reactions’, adding: 
‘He wouldn’t have known how quickly the ligature would have an 
impact … he wouldn’t have been able to save himself.’

He said Brad, 
who attended Fred Longworth High School, in Tyldesley, Wigan, was a 
‘model’ pupil, and told Mr Rothwell: ‘To have lost your wife in such 
desperately sad circumstances and [then] to have lost your son in this 
way is quite unimaginable. I am very, very sorry.’
