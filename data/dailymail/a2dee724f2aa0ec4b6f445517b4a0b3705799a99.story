You're most likely leave on time if you fly from Bristol Airport, according to new research.

Aviation analysts OAG have named the west country airport most punctual, as part of its Punctuality League 2014, which draws on flight status data from the whole of last year.

An impressive 94.4 per cent of flights departed or landed within 15 minutes of their scheduled time - compared to a measly 60.1 per cent of flights at Gatwick and 75.5 per cent at Heathrow.

'This achievement is a joint effort and is testament to the collaborative approach taken by airlines, ground handlers and our own team,' Bristol Airport Chief Executive Robert Sinclair told the Bristol Post.

'It demonstrates the advantages offered by regional airports such as Bristol, where airlines operate in uncongested airspace with greater flexibility and resilience in the event of any disruption.' 

Airports were divided into three categories: small - defined as fewer than 10 million scheduled seats per year; medium - between 10 and 20 million scheduled seats and large, which were defined as having more than 20 million scheduled seats per year.
