A Ukip parliamentary candidate has been replaced after he called for Barack Obama to be kidnapped.

Jeremy Zeid, who was standing in Hendon, said the President should be treated in the same way as a Nazi war criminal after the U.S. declassified documents about Israel’s nuclear capability.

He wrote on Facebook: ‘Once Obama is out of office, the Israelis should move to extradite the b*****d or “do an Eichmann” on him, and lock him up for leaking state secrets. After all what's sauce for the Pollard goose is sauce for the Obama gander, don't you think?’

Jeremy Zeid said  the Israelis should kidnap the US President - pictured in Boston, Massachusetts yesterday -  once he was out of office

In response to a comment, he added: ‘Nah, just kidnap the bugger, like they did to Eichmann, who suddenly found that he'd woken up in Israel.

‘The problem is that Israeli jails are far more humane and adherent to human rights than American ones.’

Mr Zeid was referring to Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi SS officer who played a major role in the Holocaust.

After the Second World War he fled to Argentina, but was kidnapped by Israeli security services and put on trial in Israel before being executed in 1962.

Ukip today announced that Raymond Shamash, an NHS surgeon, would instead be standing in the seat.

Mr Zeid wrote a further post on Facebook complaining that whoever had made his comments public a ‘squealer’ and ‘vermin’. 

Mr Zeid said he stood by his comments and likened himself to the French cartoonists massacred in Paris last year.

He said: 'Remember that phrase ‘Je Suis Charlie’? Well, freedom of speech.

'[President Obama] wants to do a deal with Iran - which wants to wipe Israel out, to see the Jewish State gone to dust. Left-wing Jewish people do not want to deal with it.'

He told the Jewish Chronicle that he was quitting as candidate for Hendon.

He said: 'I am done with politics because people focus on the minutiae.'

A UKIP spokesman said yesterday: 'Jeremy Zeid resigned as a candidate last week, citing his health. Ukip accepted his resignation.'

Last year, in a string of tweets, Mr Zeid caused a stir by saying: 'The almost absence of white faces in Ilford is worrying.'

He went on to attack Labour MP for Ilford South, Mike Gapes, accusing him of being 'either blind to or deliberately complicit in the ethnic cleansing of Ilford which I’m sure will be called "racist".'
