Scientists in Sweden claim to have captured the sound made by a single atom and say it is a very, very high-pitched high D-Note - undetectable to the human ear.

The experts, from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, were investigating the relationship between sound and atoms in the hope of learning more about quantum physics.

The believe manipulating sound on the quantum level could lead to new developments in computing - giving us faster and more efficient computers.

To reach their conclusion, they constructed an artificial atom 0.01 millimeters large.

Just like real atoms, artificial ones can be charged up with energy which they subsequently emit in the form of a particle - usually the particle is light, but in this experiment it would be sound.

The scientists started by placing the artificial atom on to a superconducting material, designed to carry sound-waves efficiently. 

After guiding sound along the material and bouncing it off the atom, they were able to record what came back - using a minute microphone.

What they recorded was a D-note, around 20 octaves above the highest note on a piano - which is much higher than the human ear can detect.

Per Delsing, the physics professor who led the experimental research group, said: 'We have opened a new door into the quantum world by talking and listening to atoms.

'Our long term goal is to harness quantum physics so that we can benefit from its laws, for example in extremely fast computers.' 

The study's co-author, Martin Gustafsson, added: 'According to the theory, the sound from the atom is divided into quantum particles.

'Such a particle is the weakest sound that can be detected' 

Sound has a short wavelength and travels 100,000 times slower than light, which means it's much easier to control.

The process opens huge potential for taking control over quantum phenomena.
