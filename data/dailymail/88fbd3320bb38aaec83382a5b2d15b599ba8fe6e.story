British companies have placed nearly 8,000 job adverts for Romanians to come and work as taxi drivers, hotel staff, nurses and even doctors.

The adverts – some of which have attracted more than 500 applicants – are written in the local language and have been posted on job-search websites in Romania.

Some UK firms require only a ‘basic’ understanding of the English language and others say that previous experience is not necessary.

However, many jobs available will pay only the minimum wage of £6.31. This is seven times the minimum hourly rate of 88p in Romania.

Recruitment agencies are advertising jobs in the UK in shop windows across Romania.

One advert reads: ‘From January 1, it will be easier to work in the UK. This is new! There are job vacancies there.’ Alongside the advert sits an image of the Union Flag.

Agencies are holding job fairs across Romania each month in an attempt to lure people to the UK.

The firms claim they have already found staff for dozens of UK-based hotel groups including Marriott, Hilton, De Vere and the Pride of Britain consortium, as well as fast-food chains such as KFC and private care homes.

The first recruitment fair in Romania for NHS specialist nurses was held by the University Hospital of South Manchester Trust in Bucharest last month.

Valentin Porubin-Lazurca, managing director of VPL Healthcare in Bucharest, one of the recruitment agencies that finds nurses, doctors and pharmacists for the UK, organised the fair.

‘More and more nurses are about to retire in the UK and they will have to recruit from overseas just to cover the replacement rate,’ he said.

‘At the same time there are too few future graduates in the UK.

‘The NHS needs one nurse for every eight beds so it is not rocket science that there will definitely be a need for highly skilled immigrants.’

Mr Porubin-Lazurca said Romanian nurses will become more attractive to British employers from today because they will no longer have to wait up to four months for their work permit to be approved.

More than 62,000 jobs were advertised by British firms in the former Communist country in 2013, up from nearly 42,000 two years earlier.

According to one healthcare expert, Romanian nurses will become more attractive to British employers from today because they will no longer have to wait up to four months for their work permit to be approved

Raluca Stefanescu, from a job website called Tjobs, said: ‘Most of the Romanians choose to leave the country for economic reasons and according to our statistics, more than 80 per cent are planning to work abroad for a few years, save some money and came back to buy a house and maybe start a small business.’

The website hosts more than 200 recruitment agencies that find workers for British employers.It found that demand was greatest for jobs in the hospitality and catering sector, followed by medical services, with 1,471 Romanian nurses registered to work in Britain between April 2010 and March 2013 under an exemption to the previous restrictions.

Other popular fields were cruise ships, restaurants and catering, agriculture, construction, engineering, childcare and elderly care.
