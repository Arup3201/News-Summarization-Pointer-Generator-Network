Incoming Centrica boss Iain Conn will receive a pay and perks package worth up to £3.7m when he begins

Bills are to be reduced by £12 a year on average after new price controls were agreed by five of the six companies that run Britain’s electricity network.

Regulator Ofgem said the cut has been driven by £2.1billion of savings it has secured from the companies’ business plans since last year.

The distribution part 
of the energy bill - which accounts for 8% of an annual dual fuel bill -
 will be on average £12 a year lower than it is today from 2015 - 2023.

However, the incoming chief executive of Centrica - which owns British Gas - is in line for a welcoming pay and perks package worth up to £3.7million when he begins his tenure as boss on January 1.

It comes as his predecessor and current Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw is expected to leave with a bundle worth up to £4 million.

Critics yesterday branded Laidlaw's sum ‘a reward for failure’.

His
 tenure has seen household energy prices increase by more than inflation
 every year.

The average dual fuel bill now stands at almost £1,300
 a year, compared to £600 when he joined in 2006.

His successor, former BP executive Iain Conn, will walk into a £925,000 salary when he takes up his new role, alongside up to £2.7m in perks and bonuses.

The exorbitant salary and welcoming package comes at a time when many families are struggling to pay their energy bills and have been branded as 'insulting'.

Labour MP John Robertson said: ‘The name Iain Conn is about right – he is conning the public with this insulting salary.

‘His base salary alone is thirty-five times the average salary and would pay the electricity bill of over seven hundred people.

‘Mr
 Conn has said he will rebuild trust into the sector. He certainly has 
not got off to a good start, and is instead living up to his name.’

Centrica yesterday said Mr Laidlaw would not receive 12 months’ pay when he leaves.

Sam Laidlaw will leave Centrica with pay and perks package worth up to £4million at the end of the year

But he will get to keep interests in hundreds of thousands of company shares under a host of lucrative rewards schemes.

These
 will pay out to him if the group hits performance targets in the coming
 years – even though he will no longer be at the firm.

He
 bowed to public pressure earlier this year by offering to donate his 
£851,000 bonus to charity – but sparked outrage by accepting a lucrative
 share scheme worth up to £2million just days later.

He also holds shares in the company worth more than £6million, built up over almost a decade’s service at the group.

Last November, Western Power Distribution was the only company to have its prices agreed early after Ofgem judged its business plan for the eight-year period showed sufficient value for consumers.

Ofgem returned five out of the six companies' plans - UK Power Networks, Northern Power Grid, SP Energy Networks, SSE Power Distribution and Electricity North West - because they failed to deliver value for consumers.

Since then, companies have identified £700 million of savings and Ofgem has ruled out a further £1.4billion following further analysis.

SSE said it was disappointed with a number of elements within the draft determination, including Ofgem's assumptions about the scope of further cost reductions across the industry.
