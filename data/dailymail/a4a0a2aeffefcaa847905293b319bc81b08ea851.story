A teenager found guilty of stabbing 21-year-old Steven Grisales to death last August in a row over a game of conkers has been jailed for a minimum of 10.5 years.

After the sentence was passed at the Old Bailey  the 15-year-old youth was led to the cells amid shouts of 'love you' as he waved to the public gallery.

Mr Grisales' father blasted the short sentence saying that 50 years would not be enough for the murder of his 'perfect son'.

Senseless: Steven Grisales died after he went over to remonstrate with three boys throwing conkers still in their spiky husks

Steven Grisales died after he got in an argument with three boys who were throwing conkers still in their spiky husks on August 31 last year.

Mr Grisales had been shopping for his grandmother and was walking to Silver Street station, Edmonton, north London, when he was attacked in College Close.

During the trial earlier this year the Old Bailey heard the boys had 
been throwing conkers at two female friends before Steven was nearly 
struck by a flying chestnut hurled by one of the men, triggering the 
row.

Witnesses said they saw the youths argue with Mr Grisales before one of them stabbed him in the chest.

Residents came to his aid but he later died in hospital from his injuries.

The youth, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, denied being the killer but was found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey, last month.

Judge Richard Marks ordered that the youth be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure with a minimum term of 10.5 years.

At the time of the killing he was under a youth rehabilitation order, imposed just weeks earlier for burglary.

However, he had cut off of his electronic tag in order to break his 9pm curfew.

Judge Marks said Mr Grisales was 'an outstanding human being in many ways'.

The convicted teen already has two convictions for two separate robberies - committed within months of each other - from 2009, including one in which an accomplice was armed with a metal compass.

One another occasion he was caught with a knife at school.

Judge Marks said his pre-sentence 
report made "grim reading" and mentioned two incidents with knives, one 
at school and the other involving his mother.

Steven's father, Jasmid Andreas was shocked to hear about his son's murderer's past.

Condemning the 'senseless killing' of his 'perfect son' he said: 'It was amazing 
learning how many offences he has done - violence, robbery, and so many 
times nothing is done.'
Speaking of the jail term he said: 'Ten and a half years for taking away our son, taking away his 
future, and all of his plans... It's a very short sentence.

'You could give him 50 years and it would make no difference.

'After hearing all the evidence we know he was just passing by and conkers were thrown at him - he was just defending himself.

'He was never in a fight, never in trouble.'

But Judge Richard Marks QC refused to lift an order banning the identification of the killer after being told he would be appealing his conviction.

He said of Mr Grisales: 'No sentence I pass could bring him back or is likely to be regarded by his family as sufficient punishment for what you did.'

He told the killer: 'Having been handed that knife, you stabbed Steven Grisales through the chest and then ran away, totally indifferent to the fate he had suffered.

'You have continued to deny the offence, seeking to blame a friend of yours for what happened and so have shown no regret or remorse whatsoever for what the jury found you did.

'For one so young you have a bad record.'

The sentence was reduced from 12 years - the starting point for a juvenile convicted of a knife murder - because of the killers age and because it could not be proved he had taken the knife with him to the scene, the judge added.

Steven’s mother Jasmid said in a statement: 'Steven was always loved by every person who had the privilege of knowing him.'

His organ donations following his death helped to save the lives of three women.Outside the court a woman wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan 'My friend is innocent', shouted: 'The police have been lazy.

'All they want is a conviction - it doesn't matter who did it,' said the woman, who identified herself only as a friend of the family.

'Your true killer will be brought to justice.

'Rest in peace Steve - my heart goes out to your family - but they have got the wrong person.'
