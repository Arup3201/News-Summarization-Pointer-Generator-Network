Celebrity fan: Model Cara Delevingne wore the Squeeze This t-shirt featuring a picture of Rihanna's bottom this week

Pop diva Rihanna could be heading for another legal showdown with Topshop – after The Mail on Sunday discovered the high street chain has been selling a T-shirt featuring a photograph of her much-exposed backside.

The singer is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Sir Philip Green’s company over another design that bears an unauthorised – and unflattering – image of her face.

She is said to be seeking £3.5 million in that case, but is apparently either unaware or unconcerned that an image of her grabbing her own bottom has been emblazoned on to another T-shirt – along with the slogan: ‘Squeeze This!’ – which is available from the store.

The picture was taken by photographer George Chin while she was on stage in denim hot pants and fishnet tights at the V Festival in Staffordshire in 2011.

It was printed on to T-shirts  by the design label Worn By and sold on the website of Topshop’s menswear section Topman for £28.

However, it was removed from sale on Thursday, hours after The Mail on Sunday asked the company about the design.

The company then released a statement saying: ‘We can confirm that the T-shirt in question is from a concession brand and is not a Topman T-shirt.’

Intriguingly, Rihanna’s friend Cara Delevingne wore the shirt at The Glamour Women of the Year Awards on Tuesday night.

The supermodel happily posed for cameras on the red carpet of the star-studded event wearing the design tucked into black pencil trousers, and even posted on Twitter a picture of herself pretending to squeeze the bottom on the T-shirt.

Rihanna, who has her own fashion line with Topshop rivals River Island, has filed legal papers over the first T-shirt, describing it as a ‘low-quality image and product that would not have been authorised’. 

The 25-year-old star is said to be annoyed that, legally, the photographer, rather than the subject of the image owns the rights to the shot.

Sir Philip is believed to have offered the singer £3,500 in compensation for using the image, but she refused.

She is said to be determined to take the
case through the courts on principle, and has already spent more than 
£600,000 of her own money on legal fees.

A source told reporters: ‘She believes they are taking advantage of artists, that it’s just exploitation and what they are doing is wrong.’

Rihanna was once a close family friend of Sir Philip and his daughter Chloe Green.

She sang at Sir Philip’s 60th birthday in Mexico last year and she spent Boxing Day with the Green family in 2010.

However, in recent weeks, 22-year-old Chloe has been pictured cuddling up to Rihanna’s ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, which is said to have enraged the singer.

Rihanna last month tweeted a racy close-up of her backside in very skimpy denim shorts in an apparent bid to make Brown jealous.
