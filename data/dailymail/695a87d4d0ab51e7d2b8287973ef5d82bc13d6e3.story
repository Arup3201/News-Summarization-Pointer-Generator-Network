A defenseless Pit Bull squealed and gasped for air as her owner grabbed her by the collar and squeezed her throat shut.

21-year-old Asani Woods from Louisiana is now behind bars after he allegedly beat his pit bull unconscious with boxing gloves.

According to sheriff's deputies, Woods was arrested after a video of the December beating was found on a cell phone belonging to a drug suspect, Johnny Dominick.

Choke hold: Woods grabbed hold of the Pit Bull around its neck to cut off its air supply

Rage: Using boxing gloves, Woods begans to strike the dog around its  head and force it into the garbage

Woods is accused of violently beating Tiger the pit bull because she made a mess in the kitchen.

On March 26, authorities arrested 21-year-old Johnny Dominick on drug charges. When they checked his cell phone for evidence, they discovered the disturbing video.

The video shows Woods choking the defenseless dogs as he held her by the throat, knocking her head against the wall and then forcing the pet into garbage.

Woods appears angry and wears boxing gloves as he begins beating the dog with his fists.

Jailed: Asani Woods was booked with aggravated cruelty in beating of his dog

Brutal: The dog is dragged across the floor by its neck towards the pile of garbage on the kitchen floor

Punished: Woods was seen beating the dog in the head and body as Tiger whimpered and cried during the attack

The pit bull yelped in agony in between blows to the stomach and head by a fist encased in a boxing glove and rapid kicks to her scrawny midsection.

Although Tiger whimpers and cries out numerous times, she eventually appears to be unconscious.

Investigators say after the female pit bull was knocked unconscious, Woods picked up the dog and hurled her across the room against the wall before smashing her to the floor.

According to deputies, Woods claimed during questioning that he was 'disciplining his dog' after it created a mess in his kitchen.

'Yeah that was me. What you going to arrest me because I beat my dog because it sh*t and pi**ed all over my house?' he asked during his arrest.

Woods claimed the incident happened in December and that Tiger survived the assault.

Deputies say Woods later brought the pit bull to an animal shelter in January.

Relentless: Woods picked up the dog before he smashed her to the floor

Excuse: Upon questioning, Woods said that he was disciplining his dog, which had created a mess in the kitchen

That shelter ended up euthanizing the dog because Woods allegedly told shelter employees that the pit bull was overly aggressive.

Woods is charged with aggravated cruelty to an animal. Dominick, 21, is charged with principle to aggravated cruelty to an animal and a number of drug counts.

Dominick, who allegedly recorded the incident is heard egging on Woods to continue the attack.

St. Bernard Sheriff Jimmy Pohlmann said the 'video is very disturbing.' He said the abuse is brutal and he has never seen 'an incident such as this captured on video.'

'He thought it was no big deal and that law enforcement wouldnâ€™t care about such an incident,' Pohlmann told reporters during a news conference.

Out of it: By this point, the dog was unconscious

Pohlmann said the video was specifically disturbing, as the dog appeared to be defenseless:

'You hear often times about pit bulls attacking individuals, you know, well, this is probably one case where you would like to see the pit bull defend himself, with such a brutal attack.'

Although Woods denies he did anything wrong, he was arrested for beating his dog. He is currently being held in the St. Bernard Parish Prison on $100,000 bond.

In addition to the drug charges, Dominick is now charged as an accomplice in the beating, as he filmed the abuse and failed to intervene. Dominick was released on Monday after posting $135,000 bond.

Asani Woods denies beating his dog until she was unconscious. However, he contends that she deserved the punishment as she made a mess in his kitchen.

Woods remains in jailed on $100,000 bail. A conviction on a charge of aggravated cruelty to an animal carries a prison sentence of one to 10 years.
