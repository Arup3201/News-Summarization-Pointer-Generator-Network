A coffee shop owner has decided to try and bring a little bit of Italy to his business - by spending £12,000 on recreating the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel on the side of his cafe.

Kevin Kavanagh had the 115 sq ft fresco of the famous Libyan Sibyl painted on the side of his cafe in the centre of Bedford in a bid to bring some Italian history to the town.

He commissioned artist Iain Carstairs to recreate the image, which was hand-painted at The Vatican by Michelangelo in the 16th century.

Fresco: The painting cost Mr Kavanagh a staggering £12,000, but he hopes it will become a landmark of the town

Place in history: Mr Kavanagh has said he hopes the painting will remain in place for more than 1,000 years

The artist used a technique dating back to ancient Greece for plastering and then painting the brick wall on the side of Mr Kvanagh's Frescoes Cafe.

Cafe owner Kevin said he hoped to recoup some of the costs through donations from residents benefiting from the new installation in his hometown.

The 58-year-old said: 'It is my way of adding to the culture of the town and both me and Iain wanted something that was historic.

'We have been able to bring a bit of Italian history to Bedford and I hope that it will be there for well over a thousand years.'

Artist Mr Carstairs said he too was pleased with the results of his endeavours.

Recreation: Artist Iain Carstairs spent three months recreating the intricate detail of the original, right, on the side of the cafe wall, left

Amazing: The Libyan Sibyl, circled, is one of the 12 prophetic figures from the roof of the Sistine Chapel

He said: 'It's so pleasing to see and it's prettier than I thought. The most exciting thing is looking out of the window and seeing people's reaction to it. They seem to connect and react to it.'

It also appears that the public are equally enthusiastic about the replica which is almost the exact same size as the original that adorns the roof of the Sistine Chapel.

Mr Kavanagh, whose son studied art at
Nottingham University, said: 'Wonderful is a word that has been coming 
up. To date there has been no negative comments.

'I want it to be a landmark of Bedford and I want generations of people to be able to come and visit it.'

Impressive: Mr Carstairs worked with plasterer Jim Smith to smooth the rough brick so the intricate detail could be added

The Libyan Sibyl is one of the 12 prophetic figures from the roof of the Sistine Chapel and depicts the priestess Phemonone presiding over the Zeus Ammon Oracle.

Mr Carstairs spent months completing the stunning wall, which he painted from scaffolding surrounding the cafe.

He worked with plasterer Jim Smith to smooth the rough brick wall so he could achieve the quality finish needed to do justice to the fine detail of the masterpiece.

The image was put on show to the public for the first time before Christmas when the scaffolding was finally taken down.

Completed in 1510, Michelangelo's rendering of the Libyan Sibyl can be found on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, in the Vatican City.

In Classical mythology, the Libyan Sibyl was the prophetic priestess presiding over the Zeus Ammon Oracle at the Siwa Oasis in the western desert of Egypt

The sibyl, one of 12 prophetic figures on the roof, is considered to be one of the finest paintings on the ceilings

She was believed by the Greeks to be the first woman to chant oracles and was the daughter of Zeus and Lamia, a beautiful Libyan queen.

Michelangelo is believed to have taken great effort to study the figure of the sibyl, called Phemeonoe, more than many others on the ceiling, which is considered a cornerstone of High Renaissance art.

His intention was for the sibyl to be looking directly at the fresco below, which features John baptising Jesus Christ in the Jordan River.

The ceiling itself was painted between 1508 and 1512 at the commission of Pope Julius II.

It was built within the Vatican between 1477 and 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV, who it is named after.

It contains various painted elements which form part part of the chapel's larger decoration scheme, including the large The Last Judgement fresco, which was also created by Michelangelo.

Nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, including the iconic Creation of Adam, are central to the ceiling's features.
