Eliott Diffley was found with a USB stick full of child porn images hidden inside himself during search

A paedophile has been jailed after he hid a memory stick filled with child pornography inside himself.

Eliott Diffley, 24, was stopped by a police officer who could smell cannabis on him and was also found in possession of a phone which had been reported lost or stolen.

PC Adam Crossnan took him to Islington Police Station, London, for a full search, where a USB stick fell from his rear.

The pen drive was examined and found to be full of child porn images.

Diffley claimed he had stolen the data stick from an internet café on October 26, 2013.

A search of his north London home revealed a huge quantity of similar images of child abuse.

Officers also probed his internet search history, which showed he had actively been looking for illegal pornography.

PC Crossan said: ‘People have preconceptions of the type of person who commits this type of crime and Mr Diffley challenges that idea.

‘The public should be reassured that investigation into any form of child abuse is taken very seriously and we will work tirelessly to bring offenders like Diffley to justice.’

Diffley, of Kentish Town, north London, was jailed for 12 months after pleading guilty to 17 counts of possessing indecent images of children.

He also admitted one count of possessing an extreme porn image at Blackfriars Crown Court yesterday.

He will now have to sign on the sexual offenders register.

Diffley, 24, admitted the charges at Blackfriars Crown Court on Thursday and was jailed for 12 months
