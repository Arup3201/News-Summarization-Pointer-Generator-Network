The body of a missing woman was discovered by police divers on Saturday as her devastated mother watched from the shore clinging to a photograph of her daughter.

Rebecca Weiss was found a week after she disappeared about 200 yards off the Terranea Resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, Los Angeles County, a favorite dive spot for her and her husband.

The 50-year-old's belongings were found near the rocky coastline after she was reported missing on August 11  by her husband, Alan Weiss - who the victim's mother, Vilma Causey, claims was having an affair and did not help look for her.

Found: Rebecca Weiss' body was recovered from the water where California diver is said to have gone missing one week ago

Identity:LA Country Coroner's office confirmed the identity of Rebecca Weiss whose family were huddled by the shore as her body was recovered

Scene: Mrs Weiss was said by her husband to have gone diving solo at their favorite location, pictured, on the day he last saw her

Weiss' mother, with the support of family members excluding Weiss' husband, has been canvassing the area relentlessly with her 50-year-old daughter’s picture sinceshe first disappeared.

Police said they are investigating both Weiss' death and an apparent drowning in the same area.

Coroner's investigator Elissa Fleak says an autopsy will be conducted Sunday. Mr Weiss told sheriff's detectives he last saw his wife driving away from their Marina del Rey home wearing a wetsuit and that Mrs Weiss was an experienced free-diver.

Mrs Weiss' mother and brother were near the resort passing out fliers when the body was found.

By 2.15pm the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner launched an investigation at the scene, according to Lt. Larry Diet, accompanying homicide investigators who were present when the body was pulled from the water.

Clues: Mrs Weiss's husband of 20 years, Alan Weiss, pictured beside her, has not been listed as a suspect and has been cooperating with authorities according to police

Devastated: Rebecca's mother Vilma Causey, left, was on the shore when the body was pulled from the water, having never stopped searching for her only daughter

Suspicious: Her brother Bob Causey believes something extraordinary must have happened to his sister if she was in the water as she was wearing a wet suit and a strong swimmer

Police had been searching for Mrs Weiss after she did not return home from a believed solo
diving expedition at a location her husband described as being the couple's favorite location.

Homicide detectives had interviewed
her husband and said he has been cooperating so far with the investigation and is not named a suspect.

But investigators say unusual circumstances related to her disappearance have led them to reclassify the case from a missing person investigation to a homicide.

Life together: Rebecca Weiss co-owned two businesses with her husband but recently, according to her mother, said she believed her husband was having an affair

Police interest in the husband comes after the mother of the missing businesswoman who said her daughter suspected he was having an affair after 20 years of marriage.

Her mother told KTLA 5 that her daughter confided in her shortly before she disappeared that she suspected her 60-year-old husband was engaged in an extramarital relationship.

Vilma Causey said: 'My daughter told me that she found it on the computer... He has a girlfriend.'

As well as this, she said that while they are doing everything they can to find her daughter - including passing out flyers in the area - Mr Weiss had done nothing to help, which the family think is strange.

She said of Mr Weiss behavior: 'Very bad, very strange. That is 
not the reaction of a person that has somebody missing that is close to 
you.

'Was she the only one on the beach to swim? Especially at that resort? No one saw her? No one saw her?'

Mrs Causey also revealed her daughter's cell phone and keys are missing, but her credit cards and driving license were found.

Her brother Bob Causey also said it is hard to believe something could have gone wrong.

'My sister is a strong swimmer, and she was wearing a wetsuit, according to my brother-in-law.'

Mr Causey said: 'So it would have to be something out of the extraordinary for something to happen to her out there.'

Husband: Alan Weiss is accused of doing nothing to help find his wife and is said to have been having an affair

Free diving is a form of underwater diving that does not involve the use of scuba gear or other external breathing devices.

Instead, it relies on a diver's ability to hold his or her breath until resurfacing.

The couple were married 20 years
and seemed happy, according to friends, who said they traveled the 
world and enjoyed their diving hobby together.

Mrs Weiss co-owned two grocery 
businesses with her husband.

Her mother said: 'There has to be somebody who must have seen. This is not an isolated place. This is a resort. There should have been people.'

Her
clothes and other belongings were found near her BMW X5, which was 
parked at the Terennea resort on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.

Mr Weiss told the LA Weekly blog
that his wife was ‘very experienced’ at free-diving, a discipline that 
does not involve using any scuba gear and relies on the ability to hold 
breath for up to three minutes.

Those
who practice it are at risk of blacking out from running out of breath 
and the sport is extremely dangerous without supervision.

The
Palos Verdes beauty spot, which is about a 22 mile drive south from her home in 
Marina Del Rey, is renowned for being very challenging, even to those 
with considerable expertise.

A review of the area on California Diving News warns divers about the dangers of entry and exit.

It
reads: ‘The two main entry points, Long Point and Marineland Cove 
require experience, skill and some luck entering over the slippery 
boulders and constantly changing cobble beach.

‘A
favorite entry point can be washed away with the next high tide. Watch 
the sets of waves. Small steps are required to enter and exit the water 
to avoid falls.’

A Coast 
Guard helicopter, a response boat and a cutter were joined by a Baywatch
Cabrillo crew and an LASD helicopter in an overnight search.

Four divers with Baywatch Marina Del Rey have began sub-surface searches on Sunday and carried on yesterday.

According to Shareen Ghabrial, who lives above the search area, a sheriff's deputy at Vanderlip Park told neighbors that the woman was a frequent snorkeler.

'On that first night ... it was quite a sight,' she told Marina Del Rey Patch.

'Our homes here were fully illuminated
by the helicopters and the frantic sounds of the workers in their boats
directly below us. It was very busy here and very intense.

'That had continued through the night with just a short break of silence in the early morning.'
