A father allegedly killed his two young sons to the witness of his estranged wife before taking his own life but sparing hers so she could suffer the loss of her children.

Police in South Florida say Victoria Flores Zavala, 36, was watching TV in her home around 1.50am this morning when she horrifyingly discovered her estranged husband, Isidro Zavala, choking one of her young boys with a rope.

The mother tried to fight off the man who no longer lived in the Boynton Beach home and begged him to kill her and spare their two boys aged 11 and 12 instead, police spokeswoman Stephanie Slater said.

‘He told her she was going to stay alive and suffer the loss of them,’ Slater said.

Police identified the children as 12-year-old Eduardo Zavala and 11-year-old Mario Zavala.

One boy was found dead in a screened patio area, and the other was in the kitchen.

Police say both were strangled with rope while the youngest, Mario, was shot several times before the father turned the gun on himself in the kitchen.

They say Isidro, who was found dressed in all black, went to the house with the intention of killing both his sons as well as his estranged wife.

The couple also has a 19-year-old son, who does not live at the home and was not at the scene at the time.

Police say his father left him an emotional note inside a blue bag left at the scene.

In addition to the note dated January 31, they found a second Tec9 automatic firearm, extra ammunition, duct tape and cutting shears inside that bag, the Sun Sentinel reports.

A second note dated January 21 was also found in another house where Isidro Zavala had been living.

The slayings were reported to Florida's Department of Children and Families.

There was no history of domestic violence or abuse reported at Victoria Zavala's home, police said.

Court records show Victoria Zavala had filed for divorce from Isidro last October after the couple married in 2003.
