Alan Pardew is already looking ahead to January in a bid to address holes in his squad with Newcastle set to lose top scorer Papiss Cisse.

The Senegal striker is almost certain to be involved in the Africa Cup of Nations, which kicks off in Morocco on January 17.

Cisse has scored four times in three games this season – his brace salvaged a 2-2 draw at Swansea on Saturday – and his goals have eased the pressure on Pardew, at least in the short term.

The United boss retains the full support of owner Mike Ashley and discussions have taken place concerning ways to improve fortunes on the pitch, where they remain winless in the Premier League.

Premier League goals for Newcastle: 

2011/12: 13 goals in 14 games 

2012/13: eight goals in 36 games 

2013/14: two goals in 24 games

2014/15: four goals in three games  

Top of the agenda for Pardew will be identifying targets for the winter transfer window. Sportsmail understands that a centre back with experience of the English top-flight is his number one priority, while bringing in a proven goalscorer – something they failed to do despite spending £35million in the summer – is also a must.

Pardew, whose side are third from bottom, said: ‘Our focus is on the short term and to see where we are when we get to January, because we really need to be away from the bottom six or seven.

‘Otherwise, in January, we might need to do something, because we want to be in the top half.’

Pardew, though, will have to be diplomatic in negotiating a transfer strategy for the New Year given the recruitment model which is in place at the club, chief scout Graham Carr the man who still holds most sway.

In the immediate future Pardew needs a win when they entertain Leicester City a week on Saturday to avoid being the first United manager to go eight games without victory from the start of a Premier League season.

Crucially, the players remain behind their boss and defender Mike Williamson says media scrutiny surrounding Pardew’s future has not been easy.

‘That is what can happen with the frenzy they can create - you end up with a bandwagon people are happy to jump on,’ he said.

‘But it is part and parcel of the game, there is no getting away from the position we are in and the results we have had, so that is the black and white of it.

‘It has been difficult, it always in when you have a bad period. But the lads are working their socks off and there is no lack of effort, we are all working hard behind the manager and trying to put things right.’

And Williamson admits the return to fitness – and form – of Cisse has come as a major relief.

‘Half the battle is having a guy like that who is scoring goals regularly,’ he added.

‘He has been fantastic. The attitude and work-rate he has shown when coming in every day during his recovery has been phenomenal and he is reaping the rewards of all the hours of hard work that people do not see.

‘He is proving a big lift for us with his performances and goals, he is exactly what we needed.​’

Meanwhile, defender Daryl Janmaat has been forced to withdraw from the Holland squad because of a hamstring injury but should be fit for the visit of Leicester.
