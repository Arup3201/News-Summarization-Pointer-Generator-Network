Oh, the joy of living on your very own country estate.

There’s not a car in sight, the birds are singing in the nearby trees … and the Tube station is just around the corner.

Granted, it’s not exactly your archetypal stately pile, not least because the grounds stretch out for no more than half an acre, but with a price tag of £105million, and tucked out of sight in an upmarket area of central London, Park House is set to become Britain’s most expensive home to be sold on the open market.

It is currently owned by Professor Gert-Rudolf Flick, the German heir to the Daimler Benz auto fortune who is worth an estimated £350million. 

Despite being a vast property, there would be no way of knowing it exists with entry via a discreet, unsuspecting drive

Mr Flick's father, Friedrich Flick, 
established the family's industrial empire by founding a conglomerate 
during the Weimar Republic between 1919 and 1933.

He
was found guilty of war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials in 1947 after 
using an estimated 48,000 labourers from Nazi concentration camps within
his many enterprises, of whom an estimated 80 per cent died from 
work-related causes.

Though
originally a member of the liberal German People's party, he donated 
over seven million marks to the Nazi party from 1933 onwards, before 
being sentenced to seven years imprisonment following the tribunal which
has become known as The Flick Trial.

He was subsequently pardoned and went on to become the richest man in West Germany before dying in 1972.

Gert Rudolph Flick has two children from different marriages, and lived in the property with his third wife, Dr Corinne Flick.

The property is on the market with Beauchamp Estates for £105 million.

Friedrich Flick is pictured facing sentencing for war crimes at his 1947 tribunal which formed part of the Nuremberg Trials brought against Nazi party members and cooperatives

This makes the nine-figure home the most expensive on the open market and 640 times the £164,000 typically paid for a house in England and Wales. It is 275 times the price of the average home in London and is one of only nine homes that fetch nine figures in the capital.

But despite the price-tag, which would incur a stamp duty charge of £7.35 million, the beautiful property is not expected to be on the market for long.

There is also planning permission to 
enlarge the home by approximately 8,000sq/ft with a subterranean 
extension to include a 50ft swimming pool along with gym and cinema as 
well as three further bedrooms above the drawing room.

Professor
Gert-Rudolf Flick has a PhD in Law from the University of Munich and is
a scholar of European art history covering the period from the 
16th-19th centuries.

Flick is a prolific buyer of artwork and antiques with Park House playing home to one of the world's finest silver collections.

He
said: 'I was attracted to it because it is almost a country house in 
the middle of London. It is very quiet. From no window can you see a car
passing by.

'I am not really leaving London but might relocate for a year to Austria, where I have a home.'

Park House in South Kensington is set in just half an acre of land and is 640 times the average house price in the UK

It is just one of nine homes across the UK that are in the nine-figure price bracket
