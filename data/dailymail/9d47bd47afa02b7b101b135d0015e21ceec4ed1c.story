Oscar Pistorius thanked his family and those who have 'picked me up through everything' after the judge retired to consider her verdict in his murder trial.

Both teams of lawyers wrapped up their cases today at the end of a months-long case that has seen Pistorius vomit, retch and break down in tears on several occasions in court.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel ended proceedings by making a final plea for the South African athlete to 'face the consequences' of shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

Judge Thokozile Masipa, only the second black woman to be appointed a high court judge in post-apartheid South Africa, will now analyse more than 4,000 pages of evidence before delivering her verdict on September 11.

Case wrapped up: Oscar Pistorius leaves court as the judge retires to consider her verdict in his murder trial

Grateful: Pistorius tweeted his family and fans to thank them for their support after the hearing

After the hearing, Pistorius took to Twitter to express his to his relatives and fans for their support.

He
 tweeted: 'Thank you to my loved ones and those that have been there for
 me, who have picked me up and helped me through everything.'

Earlier,
 as his lawyers prepared for their final chance to prove his innocence, 
the double-amputee was given a warm embrace from his estranged father, 
Henke, in court.

The pair 
have barely seen each other over the last year after Pistorius distanced
 himself from inflammatory comments his father made after his son was 
charged with murder.

Henke 
was accused of racism by South Africa's governing black ANC after he 
appeared to blame high levels of violent crime against whites on the 
party.

Double amputee 
Pistorius, 27, once a national icon for reaching the pinnacle of sport, 
is accused of murdering Steenkamp, a law graduate and model, at his home
 in Pretoria on St Valentine's Day last year.

The
 defence says Pistorius, nicknamed the Blade Runner after his 
carbon-fibre prosthetic running legs, shot Miss Steenkamp through a 
locked toilet door in self-defence, believing she was an intruder.

Mr
 Nel has spent the trial, which began in March, portraying Pistorius as a
 gun-obsessed hothead who deliberately shot Steenkamp, 29, four times as
 she was taking refuge in the toilet after an argument.

Cutting through months of complex evidence and testimony, Mr Nel ended proceedings by returning to his core argument.

'He knew there was a human being in the toilet. That's his evidence,' Mr Nel told the judge.

'His
 intention was to kill a human being. He's fired indiscriminately into 
that toilet. Then m'lady, he is guilty of murder. There must be 
consequences.'

Defence 
lawyer Barry Roux said during his own wrapping-up that psychological 
evidence had proven the track star had a heightened fight response 
because of his disability and was in a terrified and vulnerable state 
when he shot Steenkamp.

'You're standing at that door. You're vulnerable. You're anxious. You're trained as an athlete to react.

'Take
 all those factors into account,' Roux said, adding that Pistorius had 
felt exposed because he was standing on the stumps of his legs.

'He stands with his finger on the trigger, ready to fire when ready.

'In some instances a person will fire reflexively,' he added. 'That is your primal instinct.'

Roux
 also argued that prosecutors had only called witnesses who supported 
their argument and not other key people, including police officers, who 
he said would have undermined their case.

On
 Thursday, Mr Nel said Pistorius had told 'a snowball of lies' and had 
called for the track star to be convicted of intentional murder, a crime
 that could land him with a life sentence.

A potential lesser charge of culpable homicide - comparable to manslaughter - could carry a sentence of about 15 years.

Pistorius
 also faces three separate charges, including two counts of discharging 
firearms in public and possession of illegal ammunition, all of which he
 denies.

To arrive at a 
verdict, Masipa and her two assistants will have to weigh up the 
credibility of testimony on both sides, including that of Pistorius, who
 endured more than a week of torrid cross-examination during which he 
broke down repeatedly.

In the absence of a jury, experts say the crux of the case is whether Masipa accepts or rejects his version of events.

Mr
 Nel has called for Pistorius's evidence to be thrown out because it was
 'devoid of any truth' and the athlete contradicted himself when he said
 during cross-examination that he fired both accidentally and 
deliberately.

Mr Roux said 
the trial should only ever have been on the charge of culpable homicide,
 rather than murder, because he said Pistorius had clearly shot 
Steenkamp by mistake.

Mr Nel
 and Mr Roux have focused much of their closing arguments on evidence 
from witnesses who say they heard a woman scream before a volley of 
shots, supporting the prosecution's position that the couple had an 
argument before Steenkamp was killed.

Mr
 Roux went through the early morning of the shooting minute-by-minute 
during his wrapping-up, arguing that the witnesses were confused and 
contradictory about the sounds they heard.

He
 also spent time analysing photos he said proved the police had moved 
items in the couple's bedroom, countering a key claim by Nel that images
 of the room proved that Pistorius' version of the events was 
impossible.

The courtroom 
duelling between Mr Nel and Mr Roux, both dynamic advocates with 
contrasting styles, has added to the drama in a trial that has 
captivated audiences around the world.

Mr
 Nel, known as 'The Pitbull' because of his fierce cross-examination 
style and penchant for the dramatic, has been the perfect foil to Mr 
Roux, whose meticulous eye for detail has put the squeeze on even the 
most composed prosecution witnesses.

The fathers of both Pistorius and Steenkamp were in court for the first time this week.

The track star's aunt embraced Steenkamp's father before the trial resumed on Friday.

Oscar Pistorius's older brother Carl remains on a ventilator after a car crash in South Africa last week.

The
 Pistorius family said in a statement that Carl Pistorius was still 
intensive care in the capital Pretoria 'due to the serious nature of the
 injuries sustained in the accident'.

In a brief update without giving details of his injuries, the family added: 'He is stable and showing signs of improvement.'

They said previously that Carl was 'out of danger.'

He reportedly sustained
 multiple fractures in a head-on collision on a highway in northern 
South Africa as he returned from a business trip on Friday night. 

His
 uncle, Arnold Pistorius, said last week that a car swerved onto the 
wrong side of the highway and hit Carl's vehicle head-on in the crash. 

Carl
 and younger sister Aimee have regularly been at their brother's side 
during his trial for the alleged premeditated murder of his girlfriend 
Reeva Steenkamp.

Weeks 
after Oscar was charged with murder last year, Carl Pistorius went on 
trial in a city south of Johannesburg accused of culpable homicide for 
his involvement in another road accident in 2008. 

In that crash, a female motorcyclist collided with Carl's vehicle and died days later.

Carl was acquitted of all charges.
