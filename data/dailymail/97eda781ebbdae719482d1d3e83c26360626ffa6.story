A garden centre owner is in trouble after he built an illegal 'secret house' for his son and hid it within an innocuous tool shed he constructed in the grounds of his business.

Council officers who discovered the property near Gloucester described it as a 'Tardis' and found in a raid it had a fully-furnished bedroom, lounge and tiled shower room.

Because it was built with 'blatant disregard for the planning system' at the Fourboys Garden Centre in Woodfield, Stroud District Council have now ordered that it is torn down.

Row: The secret house, which was meant to be a tool shed, contained a fully-furnished bedroom, lounge and shower room

Planning: Nestled in the idyllic Gloucestershire countryside, the contents of the shed was discovered after a raid by Stroud Council

But owner Gary Winchle is entering a legal battle with the local authority, accepting that part of the building was once used as a home but he has how removed fixtures and fittings.

He has applied for permission to 
keep the building as an equipment store and for plant preparation.

'The building was supposed to be a single storey structure for 
business use, but without planning permission it had been built with two 
storeys, and officers had received intelligence that its first floor was
being used as a residential flat.

Claim: Owner Gary Winchle admits that the building at his business was lived in but now says these fixtures and fittings have been removed

'When an officer was finally allowed in, the first floor was sparsely 
furnished but did contain a fully fitted kitchen and appliances.

Battle: Owner Mr Winchle has appealed against the decision as he said the property is now a shed again

'Additionally, part of one of the rooms had been boarded off and 
officers suspected that it hid a bathroom. After this visit officers 
made several further attempts to gain access but were denied on each 
occasion.â€™

Then a secret raid this summer helped them get to the bottom of what was inside the toolshed.

'The council then approached Stroud Magistrates Court for a warrant to 
enter the building without giving notice, and the magistrate agreed that
to give notice may allow the owner to remove the furniture and hide the
bathroom.

'Upon executing the warrant, officers found a fully furnished bedroom 
and lounge together with, as suspected, a fully tiled shower room - 
which had previously been hidden from them. The building was occupied by
a couple related to the land owner.'

Gary Wichle declined to comment today but said after the council bust: ''I found it very distressing that three enforcement officers, two policemen, a building company and yourself come to the site with a warrant to break into the premises.'
