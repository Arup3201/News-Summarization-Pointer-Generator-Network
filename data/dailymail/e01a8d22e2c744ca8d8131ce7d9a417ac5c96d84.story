Jailed: Mark Cox, 22, was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to burglary, possessing a CS gas weapon and possessing a police uniform today

A police officer’s son who broke into a women's house and stole 50 pairs of knickers has been jailed for three years.

Mark Cox, 22, stole a set of house keys belonging to former school friend Emma Pinches, 21, after attending a party at her Northampton home in February.

The hospital porter then used the keys to let himself in to the property while Ms Pinches was out and steal her underwear.

The call centre worker became suspicious when she gradually noticed items of lingerie were missing over the next couple of weeks.

She only suspected Cox may be behind the thefts when she received a text from him on March 2 to ask whether she would be out with her boyfriend that evening.

Police then searched Cox’s home in Northampton and found ‘vast quantities’ of women’s underwear under his bed.

Officers also discovered CS gas spray as well as a police helmet, handcuffs, jacket and stab vest.

Last month Cox pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary, one count of possessing a weapon designed for the discharge of CS gas and possessing a police uniform.

Magistrates heard he bought the police uniform as 'memorabilia' because his father and grandfather were both police officers.

He has since received counselling in a bid to overcome his underwear addiction.

Cox was jailed for three years at Northampton Crown Court today.

Rumbled: Ms Pinches suspected Cox was responsible for the underwear thefts after he texted her asking if she would be going out with her boyfriend one night

Sentencing him, Judge Rupert Mayo, said: 'I take a very dim view of this crime. I’m not concerned about your fetish or what you stole.

'I’m concerned about how you planned this burglary by taking her keys, and how you made sure she was out when you visited her home.

'The fact this was almost a stalker-like relationship makes it altogether worse.'

Cox had told the court he bought the police uniform items off eBay to use for role play sex with his ex-girlfriend.

He admitted he had an underwear fetish and regularly bought knickers and bras from Ann Summers.

Prosecuting Jenna Allen told the court: 'When police searched his home they found vast quantities of ladies underwear.

'Ms Pinches' DNA was found on the knickers, after Mr Cox claimed he bought them all himself.

Underwear: Defence said that the actions were driven by a fetish but that he had not vandalised the property

'When Mr Cox was questioned by police, he claimed he worked as an officer with Thames Valley police.

'This later turned out to be a lie, showing there are sinister undertones in his behaviour.'

At an earlier hearing magistrates were told the items were stolen at a time when Cox was being 'driven by a fetish' for women’s underwear.

Defending, Maxine Krone said: 'He knows he has done wrong and has never offended before.

'Despite his crimes I can’t see how he would pose a threat to anyone'.

Speaking after the sentence Ms Pinches said: 'I’m shocked - it’s a longer sentence than I was expecting.

'I do feel sorry for his family but he deserved to be punished for what he did to me. From what police told me, Mark wasn’t remorseful when he was initially caught.

'I don’t know how he feels now, but hopefully this sentence will teach him a lesson and he won’t try it again.

'No one else should have to go through it. The idea of it still creeps me out. I’m just happy it has all come to a close and I can move on with my life.'
