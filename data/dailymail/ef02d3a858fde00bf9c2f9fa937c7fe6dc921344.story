Two side-by-side meteor craters on Mars have revealed that the Red Planet has undergone serious climate change in its history.

One crater in particular reveals dark traces of sediment thought to have been cemented together by water from an ancient groundwater reservoir, before being carved away by howling Martian wind.

The find, by the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter, has lent weight to the idea that Mars was once very different to the dead orb we see now.

The ancient 'climate change' that turned Mars from a wet planet - possibly capable of supporting life - to the dusty, wind-scoured orb that we see today was probably caused by changes in the axis of the planet's rotation.

Similar forces are thought to have an impact on the cycle of ice ages on Earth.

On 19 June 2011, Mars Express pointed its high-resolution stereo camera at the Arabia Terra region of Mars, imaging the Danielson and Kalocsa craters.

Danielson crater is named after the late George E. Danielson, who was instrumental in the development of many spacecraft cameras flown to Mars, and is 40 miles across.

Kalocsa crater lies in the center of the image and is smaller, about 20 miles in diameter.

Danielson crater, like many in the Arabia Terra region, is filled with layered sediments, which in this instance have been heavily eroded over time. Within the crater are peculiarly layered buttes, known as yardangs.

The asteroids litter the landscape - as they would on Earth except we have a geologically active world

Yardangs are streamlined hills carved from bedrock or any consolidated or semi-consolidated material by abrasive dust and sand particles carried in the wind.

They are seen on Earth in desert regions, with notable examples in North Africa, Central Asia and Arizona in the United States.

In the case of Danielson crater, it is believed that sediments were cemented by water, possibly from an ancient deep groundwater reservoir, before being eroded by the wind.

The orientation of the yardangs leads scientists to theorize that strong north-northeasterly winds (from the lower right in the image) both deposited the original sediments and then caused their erosion.
