Lennox Lewis has issued a statement in support of Frank Maloney following the news that his former boxing promoter is now living as a woman called Kellie and is preparing to have a sex change.

Maloney helped Lewis become the undisputed heavyweight champion but retired from boxing in October.

Lewis said he was shocked when he heard about the news, but says he respects the 61-year-old's decision.

Posting on his Facebook page, Lewis wrote: 'I was just as shocked as anyone at the news about my former promoter and my initial thought was that it was a wind up. 

'The great thing about life, and boxing, is that, day to day, you never know what to expect.

'This world we live in isn't always cut and dried or black and white, and coming from the boxing fraternity, I can only imagine what a difficult decision this must be for Kellie (formerly Frank Maloney).'

'However, having taken some time to read Kellie's statements, I understand better what she, and others in similar situations, are going through. 

'I think that ALL people should be allowed to live their lives in a way that brings them harmony and inner peace.I respect Kellie's decision and say that if this is what brings about true happiness in her life, than so be it. #LiveAndLetLive.' 

Maloney revealed she has felt trapped in the wrong body ever since she was a child.

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, she said: 'I can’t keep living in the shadows, that is why I am doing what I am today. Living with the burden any longer would have killed me.'  

The 61-year-old admits the pressure and confusion caused by her struggles with her identity caused battles with drink, depression and drugs and has been secretly receiving counselling and therapy.

Kellie says she kept her turmoil in the shadows because she feared a backlash from the notoriously macho world of boxing.

'I have never been able to tell anyone in boxing,' she added. 'Can you imagine me walking into a boxing hall dressed as a woman and putting an event on?'

Kellie is now over a year into the transition period before surgery and in the past two years she has secretly undergone hormone therapy, hair removal and voice coaching.

One of the hardest parts of the decision was telling her second wife and Kellie insists she doesn't want a new relationship and isn't interested in a sexual relationship with anybody.

A number of celebrities have expressed their support for Kellie's decision.

Stan Collymore tweeted: 'I wish Frank Maloney, now Kellie all the very best. Being who he wants to be after 61 years. Nobody deserves to begrudge him happiness.

Meanwhile Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh added: 'All the best to Kellie, formerly Frank Maloney, in her new life. Great achievements happen in boxing, as elsewhere, irrespective of gender.'

And former British cruiserweight champion Johnny Nelson tweeted: 'Frank Maloney, read your story.. It's your life, don't make others stop who you are. Ignorance is the problem of others, not yours.'

As Frank Maloney, she stood as a London Mayoral candidate in 2004 and attempted to win Barking for UKIP at the 2010 General Election.
