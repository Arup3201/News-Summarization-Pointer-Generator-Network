West Brom fans have reacted angrily to rumours that their shirt for next season will ditch the traditional blue and white stripes.

The midlands club will wear white shirts next season, with blue shorts and socks, according to information leaked to the Express and Star.

The kit will still feature blue stripes, but these are set to be much thinner, leaving fans unhappy at the break from tradition.

England keeper Ben Foster tweeted that he liked the new look, despite anger from fans. Foster tweeted: 'I do like it. Lot whiter than usual'.

A poll of over 5,000 fans however suggested that 75 per cent oppose the change, with John Homer, chairman of the West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club, calling 'an unnecessary break with tradition.'

West Brom have worn Blue and White stripes every year since 1892, with the exception of a period during the 1940s when they played in all blue.

The change was described as the biggest alteration to a Baggies kit since the early 1990s. The club wore an uneven 'bar-code' design shirt between 1992 and 1994.

The move to a pin-stripe echoes a similar change by Southampton two seasons ago. The Saints ditched their traditional red and white striped kit for a red kit with pinstripes, before removing the stripes altogether this season.

Hull City also experimented with a pinstriped kit recently, but returned to their usual equal stripes after just one season, during which they were relegated from the top flight.

Other Premier League clubs who have broken with tradition recently include Cardiff City, who changed their kit from blue to red when Malaysian owner Vincent Tan took over.Â 

West Brom were unwilling to either confirm or deny the new kit design: 'The club does not comment about the designs of new kits before they have been officially unveiled.' a spokesman said.
