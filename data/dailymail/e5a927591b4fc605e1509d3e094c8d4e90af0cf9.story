A real-life exorcist claims his services are in such high demand that he performs ten services a week.

These bizarre images show willing participants smeared in dirt and surrounded by fire, limes and eggs, who have sought Brother Hermes' help to be 'healed'.

The priest has been carrying out the 'exorcisms' in Colombia, South America, for the last 25 years and claims the ritual rids people of their evil spirits.

Ring of fire: Gisela Marulanda, 23, who claims to be possessed by spirits, participating in an exorcism ritual in La Cumbre, Valle, Colombia

Healing hands: Hermes Cifuentes, who is also known as 'Brother Hermes', calls out Gisela Marulanda's 'demons'

Ritual: Brother Hermes places his foot on the chest of Marleny Munoz, 55, who claims to be possessed by spirits

While Britain may not have a demand for such services in these modern times, in other parts of the world the village exorcist is a very public figure and remains both feared and respected.

This is particularly the case in Africa (where belief in witchcraft and possession remains strong) and here, in La Cumbre, Valle, Colombia.

In these Colombian exorcisms, the people being treated are dressed entirely in white, and they lie across the ground in between red and yellow marker posts. 

Bizarre: The 'possessed' are surrounded by flowers, lime and egg shells during the service

In high demand: Brother Hermes carries out ten services a week - totalling more than 35,000 in his 25 years of practicing

Devil of a job: Brother Hermes lays his hand on the stomach of Gisela Marulanda, 23, to reach her spirits

The 50-year-old priest, whose real name is Hermes Cifuentes, also  covers participants with black mud from head to toe — and makes them stand in a deep earth hole during  the ceremony.

Many subjects also have their eyes 
covered with  blackened bandages and lie in between strips of green and 
white  ribbon as Brother Hermes moves around them — placing his hands on
 their bodies and entreating any evil spirits to leave.

It’s not known whether Brother Hermes has a high success rate, but he is clearly doing something right, given the high demand for his services.

Each week, around ten people visit him to be ‘healed’ - amounting to a total of 35,000 exorcisms in his 25 years of practicing. 

Superstitious: The participants clutch eggs and handmade wooden crosses while ribbons are tied around their fingers
