A shameless family of benefits cheats was jailed today for swindling £90,000 using copycat lies about their love lives.

Parents Alison and Jason Parfitt pocketed public money for years by pretending their marriage had hit the rocks.

The pair were wrongly paid benefits as single people - despite still living together normally as man and wife.

And a court heard that their two children milked the system in the same way.

Daughter Gemma Parfitt, 27, falsely claimed benefits for living alone and lied that she did not knowing the identity of her own baby's father.

And the couple's son Stuart Parfitt, 29, pretended he was a single bachelor while living with his girlfriend.

Alison (pictured) and Jason Parfitt were wrongly paid benefits as single people, despite living together as man and wife. She was jailed for eight months after fraudulently claiming £26,000 in income support, housing benefit and council tax benefits. Jason admitted three charges of fraud and was jailed for seven months

A judge said he was horrified that Mrs and Mrs Parfitt even denied the existence of their own grandchildren in a bid to carry on claiming benefits.

Father-of-two Jason Parfitt, 47, was working for the Probation Service while he was dishonestly claiming benefits. 

Fraud investigators raided all three of the Parfitt's homes after an anonymous tip off and found 'all the trappings of normal family life'.

There were birthday cards, joint bank statements and even their dirty washing was used as evidence that the couples were 'happily co-habiting'.

Investigators also checked the family Facebook pages which confirmed they were couples living together. 

Pictured left, Stuart Parfitt, pretended he was single while living with his girlfriend, and was given a four-month suspended jail sentence after admitting one charge of fraudulently claiming more than £28,000. Right, Gemma Parfitt, who claimed she lived alone and didn't know the identity of her baby's father, was jailed for seven months after admitting six charges of fraud amounting to £38,000

Prosecutor Andrew Morse said: 'These cases are intrinsically linked - Alison and Jason Parfitt claimed benefits on the basis they were single.

'But between 2006 and 2009, Jason Parfitt was in full employment and living with his wife.

'Their daughter Gemma was getting income support and tax benefits on the basis she was single.

'But she was living with her partner who was in full employment.

'Their son Stuart received benefits after saying he was single but he was living with his partner and their baby.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard Alison Parfitt, 48, was an appointee for her daughter's benefits while Jason was the appointee for their son.

It meant the benefit payments were paid into the parents' accounts and then handed out to the children.

Gemma Parfitt's partner Wayne Rees (pictured) admitted one charge of fraud and was given a community order

When the benefits agency became suspicious, Mrs Parfitt denied the existence of her grandson Harley - the child of Gemma and her partner Wayne Rees, 26.

Gemma claimed Rees was just a friend and she was not romantically involved with him.

But checks showed Rees took paternity leave from work at the exact time their son was born.

The Parfitts all lived within a few miles of each other in Tredegar, South Wales.

Alison Parfitt was jailed for eight months after admitting seven charges of fraud by dishonestly claiming £26,000 in income support, housing benefit and council tax benefits.

She also admitted fraudulently receiving a further £26,000 by supporting her daughter's claims for benefits.

Jason Parfitt admitted three charges of benefit fraud including supporting his son's benefits claims. He was jailed for seven months.

Judge Jonathan Furness told him: 'You have been a party to the fraud in respect of your wife and son.'

Pregnant Gemma Parfitt sobbed as she was jailed for seven months after admitting six charges of fraud amounting to £38,000.

Her partner garage worker Rees admitted one charge of fraud and was given a community order.

Stuart Parfitt admitted one charge of fraudently claiming more than £28,000 and was given a four-month suspended jail sentence.

Parfitt told the court he wanted to be jailed like the rest of his family but the judge refused his request.

After the case, a spokeswoman for the Department of Work and Pensions said the Parfitts had swindled a total of £90,700 of public money between them.
