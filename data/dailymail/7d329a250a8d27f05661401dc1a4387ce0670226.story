A Christian worker who claimed his Muslim employers discriminated against him because he was white has been awarded more than £2,500 in compensation.

Christopher Turton, 31, was one of only two white workers at the National Halal Food Group in Birmingham, which supplies supermarkets with meat prepared in accordance with Islamic Sharia law.

A tribunal heard that after Mr Turton was promoted at the company, he saw an e-mail in which a colleague suggested he was being given an unfair advantage, asking: 'Is it because he is white?'.

The e-mail, understood to have been sent from employee of the firm to a self-employed worker and seen by Mr Turton, also pointed out that the 31-year-old was not a 'Muslim brother' and added: 'Allah is the provider'.

The worker also claimed Mr Turton had only been employed by the company to impress customers, the hearing was told.

Mr Turton, from Halesowen in the West Midlands, was awarded £2,550 at an employment tribunal in Birmingham after seeking compensation from the Halal Food Group for race and religious discrimination.

Tribunal judges found in the claimant's favour on both counts.

The tribunal heard Mr Turton had introduced changes while employed by the firm in a bid to boost its income.

But the changes were not wholly welcomed, said Sonny Jagpal, representing the respondents.

Mr Jagpal said: 'The firm's management disapproved of the email and arranged a face-to-face meeting with those involved and issued an apology, those who sent the email have also apologised.'

Tribunal judges heard that Mr Turton found the email 'extremely offensive', and that it caused him to sign off work with stress and eventually resign from the company.

Tribunal judge Victoria Dean said Mr Turton had found the email racist and offensive and said there had been an injury to his feelings.

She initially awarded him £3,000 but this was reduced to £2,550 because he had failed to lodge an official grievance to the firm.

Ms Dean recommended the company issue instructions to the workforce and team leaders, within six months, about equal opportunities policies.
