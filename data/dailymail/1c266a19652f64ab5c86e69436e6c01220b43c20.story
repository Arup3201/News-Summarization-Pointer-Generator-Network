A quick-thinking Texas kindergarten student is being credited with saving his choking friend's life by performing the Heimlich maneuver.

Jasiah Rubalcava, 5, was eating lunch at West Avenue Elementary School in San Antonio when he noticed that his friend, Nicholas Carvajal, also 5, was choking on a chip.

'He was choking on a big chip,' Rubalcava told KENS-TV.

Carvajal started grasping his throat as his face turned red, according to cafeteria monitor Charlotte Rowe.

Rubalcava quickly moved behind his friend, wrapped his arms around him and started performing the Heimlich maneuver.

'It felt like kind of weird, cause when it popped out, it scraped the lining to my throat,' Carvajal told KSAT.

Ms Rowe later took Carvajal to see the nurse.

'He was fine and we realized that Jasiah had saved his life,' Rowe said.

Rubalcava has not taken a first aid or CPR class, but he thinks he saw the maneuver performed on the The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, the Disney Channel show starring Dylan and Cole Sprouse as trouble-making twins Zack and Cody.

Rubalcava's mother, Monica Garcia, stressed the importance of teaching children first aid, and she thinks her son might make a good paramedic some day.

Carvajal's father, Chris, said his son has learned a good lesson.

'He has a habit of eating his food too fast,' he said.
