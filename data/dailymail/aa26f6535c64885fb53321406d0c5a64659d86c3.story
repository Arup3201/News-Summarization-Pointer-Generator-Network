The Italian football federation's new president is unconcerned about an investigation by UEFA over his alleged racist comment.

Tavecchio, a long-standing executive in Italian football, was elected last month as the new head of the Italian FA.

But the 71-year-old then caused controversy over a reference to bananas when discussing the presence of foreign players in Italy. 

Controversy: Carlo Tavecchio caused a controversy when he made comments about foreign players

Speaking to RAI state TV  Carlo Tavecchio sayid, 'I'm serene, because I was cleared in Italy. But if I'm summoned I'll defend myself and show that I'm innocent.' 

While the Italian federation's internal prosecutor dropped his inquiry over the comment 10 days ago, UEFA is expected to issue a ruling in the coming days.

European football's governing body could impose a fine and suspend Tavecchio for up to three months  if he is found guilty.

Ruling: Tavecchio's comments are being investigated by UEFA and he could face a fine and suspension
