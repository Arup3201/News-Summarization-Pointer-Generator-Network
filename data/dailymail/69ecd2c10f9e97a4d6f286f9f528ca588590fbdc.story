Karl Stefanovic has called for more cultural diversity on Australian television and advised non-Indigenous Australians to 'butt out' from commenting on problems faced by Aboriginal Australians.

The Channel Nine Today show host made the comments during an interview with the National Indigenous Television (NITV) channel on Thursday.

'I do believe that there should be more faces,' Stefanovic told NITV.

Today show host Karl Stefanovic has called for more cultural diversity on Australian television during an interview with the National Indigenous Television (NITV) channel

'I think that fundamentally white people are pretty bland. They're pretty beige and the more difference you have in colour, in accent, in race, in humour, in belief - I think the richer you are.'

The 40-year-old had been invited to speak about the representation of Indigenous Australians in media following a panel discussion on the Today show regarding SBS's recently released documentary series, First Contact.

Despite the series' main premise being that six out of 10 white Australians have never met an Indigenous person, the panel of four did not include an Indigenous Australian's opinion in their discussion.

When confronted about this fact by NITV, Stefanovic promptly replied: 'there was no thought given to that,' before admitting he had asked himself at the time: 'why are we doing this?'.

NITV questioned him about a panel discussion of SBS's First Contact that he took part in which did not include an Aboriginal Australian's opinion. This is despite the show's main premise being that six out of 10 white Australians have never met an Indigenous person

Despite confessing that he did not know how to change the norms of Australian media to include more indigenous voices, the television host called, more generally, for 'white people' to 'stop talking with any degree of expertise' about the problems faced by Aboriginal Australians.

'I don't want to hear from people in the city like myself who are in nice suits and in nice houses and drive nice cars and earn a great wage, talking about what it must have been like for Aboriginal Australians,' Stefanovic said.

'I don't want to hear them talking about or offering their opinions about how to fix a situation that they have no idea about.

Stefanovic also said he believed 'white people' should 'butt out' and stop commenting on the problems faced by Indigenous Australians, saying 'For too long I believe white people have been trying to stop the problems of indigenous Australians and they have no idea how to do it'

'For too long I believe white people have been trying to stop the problems of indigenous Australians and they have no idea how to do it.

'We don't know what it's like or what it must be like to live as an indigenous Australian... so butt out.'

Stefanovic also opened up about his own experience with different ethnicities during the interview, mentioning that he came from an Icelandic background and went to school in Cairns with peers from a 'melting pot' of cultures.
