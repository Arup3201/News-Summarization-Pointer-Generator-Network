Sportsmail asked Tottenham fans' blog the Spurs Web to reveal the mood around White Hart Lane following the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as their new manager. Joseph Meakin discusses whether the board have made the right decision and how the fans feel about their new boss.

There has been a huge wave of positivity and excitement around Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, after the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as our new head coach was confirmed.

Memories of last season’s swashbuckling, confident Southampton team live strong in the memory of most Spurs fans, who seem excited to see what Pochettino can do with a squad full of players with more quality than was available at St. Mary’s.

New man in charge: Mauricio Pochettino has been named as the new manager of Spurs

Whilst Ajax boss Frank de Boer was the man that most Spurs fans wanted to see take the club forward, the excitement about Pochettino speaks volumes of how well he is thought of by Tottenham fans.

I always felt that Pochettino was a 
much better fit to what Daniel Levy wants to achieve at White Hart Lane 
than De Boer, so I am pleased that we have gone with the Argentinian.

Pochettino’s
 high-tempo, attacking philosophy can, I believe, be easily translated 
to our squad, and Pochettino has managed in England long enough to have 
tailored his preferred set-up to suit the physical demands of the 
Premier League.

On the attack: Andros Townsend can provide Spurs with an outlet for getting forward

The Pochettino way: Sandro, Mousa Dembele and Lewis Holtby play the way the new boss likes

Benefit: Erik Lamela could thrive under Pochettino's guidance

Players
 like Lewis Holtby, Sandro and Mousa Dembele have both the ability and 
work-rate to press the opposition how Pochettino likes, and in Christian
 Eriksen, Andros Townsend and Erik Lamela, I really feel we have a 
young, creative set of attacking midfielders who could all benefit from 
playing in Pochettino’s exciting system.

Whilst
 I am very happy to see the back of Tim Sherwood, the work that Sherwood
 did to promote players from the academy was refreshing. I am hopeful 
that Pochettino will continue this policy at White Hart Lane, and there 
is no reason why he shouldn’t.

Young hope: Spurs fans would like to see players like Tom Carroll given a chance

Time to go: Spurs fans were glad to see the back of Tim Sherwood as manager

The
 likes of Tom Carroll, Nabil Bentaleb, Alex Pritchard, Harry Winks, Ryan
 Fredericks and Musa Yahaya are all exciting young players, and players 
who will be looking to get a chance under the new manager.

I’m
 excited; the fans needed a change of atmosphere after the diabolic 
season we have just had to endure, and a manager like Pochettino is just
 what we needed.

If Levy gives Pochettino time, I am confident Spurs will progress under his leadership.
