'Under pressure': Stuart Beddows hanged himself at his home in Walsall, West Midlands, in September

A dedicated nurse killed himself just weeks after he voiced concerns over the pressure created by staff shortages at the hospital where he worked.

Stuart Beddows hanged himself at his home in Walsall, West Midlands, in September, after suffering from stress, an inquest held last month heard.

It was told that the 43-year-old had felt burdened by the death of a former patient, and was worried about the introduction of a new computer system at the hospital.

Today, Mr Beddows' family has spoken of his death, saying that he 'loved' nursing but that 'pressure built up'. 

Mr Beddows, who was lead nurse in the endoscopy unit at Walsall Manor Hospital, was found dead in his home after friends and family could not contact him.

At the inquest, Black County coroner Zafar Siddique ruled Mr Beddows intended to take his own life.

Director of nursing for the hospital Kathryn Halford told the hearing that colleagues were aware Mr Beddows was suffering from stress and tried to offer him support, according to the Express & Star.

She said problems with the new computer system added to his pressures, and said his colleagues were concerned about the hours he was working without breaks. 

He was also worried about the work needed for an upcoming hospital assessment, she claimed.

But she said the most important concern appeared to be the death of a young woman, who died on readmission to hospital three days after he had performed an endoscopic procedure on her.

She told the inquest: 'Her death was nothing to do with the endoscopy, it was entirely different, and staff spent a lot of time talking to him about it.'

Mrs Halford added that Mr Beddows had been offered help to deal with his problems, but had declined the offer.

The inquest was also told that on July 14 he had talked to his GP about the pressures of work, but did not take his advice to take time off work.

Speaking at the time, Mr Siddique said: 'The new computer system introduced was causing a backlog of patients, and there was the patient who died following a procedure. 

'There was support from colleagues, but he was affected by that.' 

Today, his mother Maureen, 74, said that he 'loved being a nurse' but said that he felt 'people's lives were at risk in his department because of the lack of staff'.

Strained: The inquest was told that Mr Beddows, 43, had felt burdened by the death of a former patient, and was worried about the introduction of a new computer system at the hospital

She said: 'He would work more than 12 hours a day, only having time for one cup of coffee. There just wasn't enough staff and he was working evenings and Saturdays too.'

She claimed that in the months leading up to his death he was working 14-hour days, six days a week. She added that she blamed Government cuts to the NHS and his workload for his death. 

Mr Beddows began his nursing training when he was 18 before getting a permanent job at Walsall Manor Hospital in in 1999.

He worked his way up to lead nurse practitioner in endoscopy but was soon working up to 80 hours or more a week to cover staff shortages, his family claimed today.

Mrs Beddows said: 'It was always a very stressful position, any nursing job when dealing with people's lives is. But as time went on, the stress and pressure built up.'  

Mr Beddows' sister, Mandy Hicken, said: 'There wasn't enough staff. He was working long hours without proper lunch breaks.

'I remember him telling me that he worked a 12-hour shift and had only enough time to drink one cup of coffee - there was no time for food.

'He was also working extra clinics during the evening and at weekends. It was all classed as overtime but he needed to do it. 

'Over the last two weeks of his life he was going in a 7am and finishing at 9pm. He said he had asked for more help, but he was given bank nurses and they weren't up to his standards. 

'He wasn't supported and the resources weren't there. We were told he was offered counselling, but he said he needed more than that - he needed help with his workload.' 

Support: Kathryn Halford, director of nursing for Walsall Manor Hospital, above, where Mr Beddows worked,  told the inquest that colleagues were aware that he was suffering from stress and tried to offer him support

Stuart's other sister Andrea Stringer said: 'He was a happy go-lucky person and would help anybody. 

Since his death we have been contacted by so many people grateful for his treatment, even someone from Australia got in touch. He treated patients really well, put them at ease.'

Richard Kirby, chief executive of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'The outcome of the inquest in November reflected our own internal review that Stuart was experiencing a high level of stress in the workplace.

'His line manager and colleagues were aware of this and had responded by offering a number of supportive solutions.

'We are very sorry that we were not able to help Stuart further to prevent this tragedy.

'We already had a number of support mechanisms in place such as an Emotional Health and Wellbeing service and Occupational Health service which are both easily accessible to our staff.

'We have strengthened these services recently with staff being actively encouraged to raise concerns about their colleagues through various open channels if they feel that someone needs support.'
