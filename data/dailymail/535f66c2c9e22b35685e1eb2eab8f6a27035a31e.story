These shocking images show a group of horses in agony after they were found on a housing estate trapped in barbed wire.

The RSPCA has launched an urgent investigation after tearful residents discovered the frail animals tethered on a plot of urban land.

Five horses and a pony were found on a small patch of grass on a council estate in Low Simonside, near Jarrow, South Tyneside.

Wounded and neglected: Local residents were reduced to tears at the sight of a frail group of horses tethered behind gates. They were found on a housing estate trapped in barbed wire

One of the animals required urgent help after it was found dragging barbed wire from its leg and mane.

But despite the state of the animals the council has so far been powerless to remove the horses and appeals to the owner have been ignored.

Both the RSPCA and South Tyneside Council are trying to resolve the issue but the owner has so far refused a notice demanding he remove his horses from the public land.

Alan Bartlett, 66, whose home overlooks the site, said: 'Itâ€™s absolutely disgusting and a disgrace that horses should be left like that.'

Looking for scraps: The horses have been left on a muddy patch of grass with no food or water. Residents have been horrified at the sight of the neglected horses

Councillor Arthur Meeks of South Tyneside Council said: 'I was horrified when I saw one of the poor animals with the wire wrapped around its tail and leg.

'It was very distressing and I believe a couple of local ladies were reduced to tears. We understand the horses have been tethered there illegally since before Christmas.'

Although the site was illegally padlocked, a council officer was able to access the field and unwrap the barbed wire.

RSPCA officials were informed about the site and notices have been served on the horsesâ€™ owner to remove the animals.

A South Tyneside Council spokesman, said a number of its departments are working collectively to swiftly resolve the situation.

'The council has served a notice to the animalsâ€™ owner asking them to remove the horses from the site.

'Despite assurances that they would be removed at the start of this week, they remain on the land.

'The council is concerned both at the unauthorised occupation of the land, and the environment in which the animals are being left. The RSPCA have also attended the site with a view to assessing the condition of the animals.

'Should the owner not comply with our requests, there may be no other option but to bring in the services of an enforcement company to take control of the animals.

'Tethering horses on council land is not permitted, as this action can cause danger to the public and can adversely affect the welfare of the horses themselves, as well as cause damage to the land.

'The council will not tolerate this, and will continue to take necessary action against irresponsible horse owners.'
