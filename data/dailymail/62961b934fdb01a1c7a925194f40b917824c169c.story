The fight was finally stopped when a man picked Padron off the ground.

Padron and the other girls in the fight were all suspended initially, but her suspension was overturned, CBS Miami reported. 

A relative of the teen's who did not want to be identified said: 'The video makes you want to go hurt somebody but you can't.

'When she was on the ground they were kicking her in the head and stomping on her.'

Padron and her mother reported the fight to the school district and are pressing charges. 

A district spokesperson disputed that the principal promised to kick the girls out of Homestead Middle School 

Padron's family say 'the system is broken' and have started a GoFundMe account to raise money for a move

The girls in the video posted messages on Facebook identifying themselves as members of a gang and uploaded pictures where they can be seen throwing up gang signs.

In a post, one of them wrote: 'Me and my sisters don't know what a one on one is 100 percent. 

'Even if my sister beating life out of somebody, I ain't gonna watch, I'm gonna beat the life out of that (expletive) too.

'That's how we're raised.'

The mother of one of the alleged gang members threatened Padron's mother three different times about pressing charges against her daughter.

One of the victim's relatives said the mother of one of the girls threatened Padron's mother three different times if she pressed charges against her daughter

The relative who spoke to the station said the principal promised to kick the girls out of school, a claim which was disputed by a school district spokesperson.

Padron's family believes not enough is being done and the 'system is broken'.

They are trying to save up enough money to move and created a GoFundMe page.

In a Facebook post that accompanies that account, another family member - ostensibly Padron's sister who lives elsewhere - wrote: 'Please help my mom and sisters get out of this bad neighborhood.

'They moved there 10 in the morning and it looked nice and quiet. came back around 7pm and realized they moved into a ghetto. 

'Automatically became targets. The police wouldn't help, the principal didn't care till the media got involved.

'Now they are being harassed by the system because they think she is talking to the media. 

'She was scared to say anything because she was already getting death threats. 

'I am out of state, so the best I could do is notify family there in Florida and set up funding online to help.

'I had to say something, can't let my family continue to be victimized and not say or do anything.'
