A man who drunkenly threw his terrified pet dog off the end of a 15ft high pier has been warned he could face jail.

Paul Sanders scooped up his howling collie called Shep and threw him over the edge and into the sea without checking the depth of the water.

As witnesses screamed in protest he told them: 'This is how you get your dog to swim.'

Fortunately Shep was not hurt in the fall but Sanders, 47, of Torquay, admitted to magistrates that he had failed to protect the dog from pain, suffering or injury on a sunny May afternoon.

Sanders was seen by witnesses drunkenly staggering about in his Speedo trunks on Babbacombe pier and shouting at his two dogs, a collie and a spaniel.

One witness said she saw him walk over, scoop Shep up in his arms and throw him over the edge without looking at the depth of the water.

She said: 'He picked up the collie dog which appeared to be struggling against the top level of the wall and just threw the dog off into the sea below.

'It happened so fast I just screamed.

'I thought he was just losing the plot. I thought the dog was dead but it suddenly surfaced.

'It was constantly howling and trying to get up the steps.'

She said the tide was low and the dogs were clearly scared.

A second witness on the pier said an agitated and intoxicated Sanders swore at her about her own dogs a few moments before the incident.

She said after he put Shep on a ledge 'The dog frantically resisted and seemed to sense something was not quite right.'

She pleaded with Sanders: 'Don’t do that, don’t be silly.'

But he ignored her and did not appear to look over the edge.

The dog appeared distressed and disorientated when it surfaced and ‘didn’t seem for a brief moment to know where to swim’.

When she remonstrated with Sanders he just snapped back: 'They’re my dogs I can do what I want. If you’ve got a problem report me.'

The two women did report him and Sanders was arrested soon afterwards.

He denied being drunk and in court said he was deeply sorry for his actions.

The court was shown letters of support from Sanders’ GP and a local pet shop saying how much he cared for his animals.

Susanna Whale, defending, said a vet had seen both the dogs and confirmed they were not injured.

'He is a man who loves his animals,' she said.

'They are his life. This is one incident and he acted wrongly.'

She said he feared his dogs would be taken away but promised that if he had them back nothing like this would happen again.

Torbay magistrates asked for reports from the probation service.

Chairman of the bench John Kiddey said: 'We consider this a very, very serious offence. We are not ruling out custody.'

He said the offence was made worse by the fact Sanders was drunk and it has been in front of children and people ‘who were clearly terrified’.

'When you pushed that dog over the edge you didn’t know if there were rocks there or not.'

Sanders was granted unconditional bail until next month.
