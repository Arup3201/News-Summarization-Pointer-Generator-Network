Robert Pires has been making the most of his free time ahead of his move to the Indian Super League by spending time with his wife Jessica in the Caribbean.

The pair have been enjoying the glorious sunshine at the Eden Rock hotel - a luxurious resort in St Barth which is one of the top 100 hotels in the world.

The 40-year-old agreed to come out of retirement last week to link-up with the likes of former team-mate Freddie Ljungberg and David Trezeguet, who will also be involved in the inaugural season which begins in October.

It was announced a fortnight ago that former Sweden midfielder Ljungberg had penned an ambassadorial contract with the ISL, while Pires is expected to line up for one of the league's eight teams.

The Arsenal legend hung up his boots following a brief spell at Aston Villa in 2011, but the veteran is relishing a return to the game at the ripe age of 40.

He told the ISL's offical Twitter feed: 'I am very happy to be part of the new League when passion for football in India is on the rise.

'It will be great to play in front of enthusiastic Indian fans as well as share my knowledge with my team-mates.'

The ISL will run between October and December.
