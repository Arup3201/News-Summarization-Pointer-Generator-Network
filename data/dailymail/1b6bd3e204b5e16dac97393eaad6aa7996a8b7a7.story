Real Housewives star Melissa Gorga has claimed that it is 'disgusting' to think that her new book advocates for marital rape.

Melissa Gorga who found fame for her 
role on Real Housewives of New Jersey has penned a book about her 
marriage and one portion that her husband Joe contributed is causing 
outrage.

'Men, I know you think your
woman isn't the type who wants to be taken. But trust me, she is. Every
girl wants to get her hair pulled once in a while. If your wife says 
"no," turn her around, and rip her clothes off. She wants to be 
dominated,' he wrote. 

'Women don't realize how easy men are. Just give us what we want.'

Shaking off the controversy: Real Housewives star Melissa Gorga shrugged off the controversy that her new book advocates marital rape during an interview with E! News this weekend

Controversy: Melissa Gorga promotes her new book which has attracted criticism over alleged suggestions of marital rape in New York this weekend

Speaking to E! News this weekend, Melissa said: 'My book is about mutual respect with your partner, for one another. It's about honesty, it's about loyalty, it's about making your partner first in your life.

Advice: Melissa Gorga's new book giving her wisdom on how to have a 'hot and happy' marriage

'Where that word comes into play, to me, is awful and disgusting, to be honest with you.'

She said that her husband Joe's quote that has stirred controversy has been taken out of context.

She insists that she offered some great marriage tips to readers, promoting 'teasing' and 'playfulness' and that the scathing headlines were unwarranted.

The couple's sex life is discussed at 
length in the book by both of the Gorgas, and Melissa advocates both 
'real passionate sex and maintenance sex'.

'Maintenance
sex keeps the wheels greased, the lines of communication open, and the 
fights to a minimum,' she wrote, according to Jezebel.

Her frequent mentions of fights that are avoided using sex has raised some eyebrows about their tempestuous relationship.

'In
the beginning, Joe wanted to have sex every single day, at least once, 
if not twice or three times…If I didn't give it to him once a day, he'd 
get upset,' she wrote.

'I can do something that pisses him 
off on a Monday, but if we had sex on Sunday night, it blows over more 
easily. But if we haven't done it for two days and I give him attitude? 
It could be a huge fight.'

Joe Gorga is the brother of Teresa Giudice, who is another one of the stars on the New Jersey-based reality show.

In spite of her tips about how she has to be home when her husband gets home and how she dresses to impress him, Gorga maintains that the book - like their marriage- is all about 'mutual respect'.

'I think it's controversial in many ways because we do really live an old school type of marriage but with a modern twist,' she said in a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight.

The Gorgas have three children- two boys and a girl- and Gorga has said that she will be happy to give the book to her daughter when she gets married someday so that she knows how to approach her own marriage.

Though her marriage is said to be 'hot and happy', her continual fights with Teresa remain a regular storyline on the reality show.
