A millionaire who is known for his charitable giving is looking to receive a little companionship this holiday season.

But instead of a letter to Santa Claus, multi-millionaire Marc Paskin has set up a giant personal ad in the form of a billboard in a California neighborhood.

Mr Paskin, 63, a real estate tycoon from San Diego, paid for a huge billboard on the San Diego Freeway, which reads, 'All I want for Christmas is a Latina girlfriend.'

The secret's out: Paskin, showed in a promo image from Secret Millionaire, appeared on the reality show last year

The billboard also includes an AOL email address for interested parties to get in touch with him.

Marsha Paskin, Marc's wife of 28 years, died of diabetes in 2002.

Mr Paskin has two adult children and three grandchildren.

Generosity: Mr Paskin has donated a large amount of his time and fortune to helping the less fortunate

Gold diggers need not apply to Mr Paskin's billboard, as he has donated a large amount of his time and fortune to helping the less fortunate.

Last year, he was featured in an episode of the ABC reality series Secret Millionaire.

The cameras followed Paskin as he 
lived in Detroit on $10 a day for an entire week and worked as a homeless 
shelter volunteer - without anyoneâ€™s knowledge of who he really was.

U-T San Diego reported that by the end of the week, he donated about $125,000 to the individuals whom he interacted with at the shelter.

And his charitable ways did not stop on Secret Millionaire, as he went on to cut a check for a 'free apartment for one year' to a woman whose daughter and mother were killed by her estranged husband.

He has also donated more than $1.3million to the Shiley Eye Center and Jacobs Retina Center - a facility dedicated to helping people regain lost eyesight.

In a 2011 interview with U-T San Diego, Mr Paskin said that he has received 'endless' requests for monetary help from people all over the country since he appeared on Secret Millionaire.

In the same interview, he revealed that his hobbies include spending time with his grandkids, and singing karaoke while dressed as Elvis.
