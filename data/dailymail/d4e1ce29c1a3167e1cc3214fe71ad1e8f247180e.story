Fantasy: It's always been five-year-old cancer sufferer Miles' dream to be Batman

It's every boy's dream to be Batman.

But for five-year-old Miles who is battling life-threatening leukemia, the incredible superhero is a source of strength.

So when Make-A-Wish Foundation asked the  'sunny, positive little boy' what he wished for, his answer came easily: 'I want to be Batkid!'

On November 15, the foundation will transform San Francisco into Gotham City for a day, with thousands of volunteers already signed up to help young crime fighter Miles capture villains and save the city.

Along with a grownup Batman sidekick, Miles will get a call from the police chief and jump into his  Batmobile to defend the city against some of his fiercest foes, including the Riddler and Penguin.

His first task: rescue a damsel in distress who is tied up across the Hyde Street cable car tracks in Nob Hill.

Then he will help to capture the Riddler as he tries to rob a vault downtown, before refueling at the Burger Bar in San Francisco, according to the Make-A-Wish itinerary.

While at Burger Bar, he will get a call on his batphone to go to the window. He will look down and see a huge group of volunteers screaming for Batman’s help.

That's because the Penguin will be kidnapping a famous Gotham City mascot - Lou Seal.

Incredible: Make-A-Wish Foundation will transform San Francisco (pictured) into Gotham City on November 15 so little Miles can fulfill his dream of becoming Batman

Batman and Batkid will race to AT&T 
park to apprehend the villain and free Lou Seal, the San Francisco 
Giants mascot since 1996.

After catching the Penguin, Batkid will make his final stop at City Hall, where the Mayor and the Police Chief of Gotham City will thank him and give him the key to the city.

The Make-A-Wish Foundation grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to give them hope.

Other incredible wishes it has granted include Justin Bieber meeting eight-year-old Annalysha Brown-Rafanan, who suffers from a life-threatening liver condition, and 11-year-old Tyler Sue, who has a serious genetic condition, meeting her 'Cake Boss' idol, Buddy Valastro.

More information about Miles' big day is on the Make-A-Wish webpage.
