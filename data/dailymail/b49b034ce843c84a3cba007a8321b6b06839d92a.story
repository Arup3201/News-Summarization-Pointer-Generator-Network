Forget some tinsel and a wreath, this quiet cul-de-sac has gone to town with its Christmas decorations to ensure Santa will have no trouble spotting the festive families from his sleigh.

Neighbours have joined forces to transform Greyhound Close, in Hedge End, Hampshire, into a winter wonderland with thousands of lights and decorations.

With six-foot snowmen, dancing reindeer and even an appearance from Father Christmas himself, the annual display attracts visitors from all over the country.

The group of residents have raised £38,000 for Naomi House children's hospital in Winchester since 2004.

Mike Parsons, one of the organisers, said: 'It is becoming increasingly difficult each year to find things. So there is an element of creativity this year and we have to create things for the show.' 

Festive families, streets and even pubs across the country have also got into the Christmas spirit and one Frozen-inspired lights display in Dagenham, Essex, drew a crowd so large that police had to close the road. 

Thousands of people crammed into a small residential close in New Milton, Hampshire, to see the huge display which used an estimated 1,000 bulbs.
