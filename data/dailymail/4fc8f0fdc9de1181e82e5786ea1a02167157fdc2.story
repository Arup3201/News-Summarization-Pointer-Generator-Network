Weight loss can have many positive effects and for one woman, it has helped her career soar.

Amanda Dodd, 41, from Solihull, West Midlands once tipped the scaled at 17 stone and hid behind baggy size 22 dresses but was determined to squeeze back into her sexy size 10 corset after landing a lead role as Sally Bowles a cabaret which was to be performed in front of 1,100 people.

The mother-of-one was so determined to lose the pounds that she shunned junk food to achieve her goal and her professional life has bloomed ever since.

Amanda once weighed 17st but she cut out the junk food to shed the pounds and hasn't looked back since

And just two years after her new weight loss programme, Amanda is now running her own health and wellness business, helping other people to transform their lives.

Amanda said: 'I’d always been a fairly big child - and although I was very active, I’d always enjoyed my food, and been bigger than all my peers.

'As I got older, and had a family, more and more weight crept on, and I started to become a shadow of my former self.

'At my biggest, I weighed over 17 stone - and hated being in the limelight.

'I’d always loved acting and being on the stage, but the bigger I got, the less and less confident I became, and I started to take parts backstage, rather than acting and singing.

'One of my friends insisted that I take on a role in one of his plays - and wouldn’t take no for an answer.

'I knew straight away that I couldn’t go on stage with all those people looking at me, and that I had to do something about my weight.

'The thought of getting on stage in front of people made me feel sick.'

Amanda cut out the junk and began a strict exercise regime - after enrolling on the lighter life diet plan.

And as the pounds melted away, her confidence soared - as she went from 17 stone to a svelte size 8 to 10 - weighing in at just over 10 and a half stone.

Amanda added: 'As soon as the weight started to come off, I got more and more determined to achieve my goal.

'My confidence was sky high - I started auditioning for loads more roles, and was thrilled when I landed the part of Sally Bowles - and I didn’t have to worry about fitting into the costumes.

'That is the role of a lifetime for me - but never in my wildest dreams think I’d ever be able to play it at my size.

'Once I lost weight, every area of my life seemed to improve - because I was more confident, I started becoming more vocal at work, which led to me being promoted.

'I realised that I could help other people with their confidence issues too, and found I finally had the confidence to start my own business - helping people with their health and wellness.

'Sometimes it’s weight loss that’s an issue for people, sometimes it’s purely a confidence issue, but I try to help people achieve whatever their goals are by helping them adopt a healthy lifestyle.'
