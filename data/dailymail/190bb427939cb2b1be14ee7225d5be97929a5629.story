Australian Robert Allenby has elected to skip this week's Humana Challenge following the incident in Hawaii in which he reported being kidnapped, beaten and robbed.

The 43-year-old has said he has 'no recollection' of events that unfolded last Friday after he missed the cut at the Sony Open and spent the evening in a wine bar.

Allenby has explained that he was found unconscious six miles away in a park with significant facial injuries and missing his wallet, mobile phone, cash and credit cards.

Allenby says he was dumped about six miles away from the bar he had been drinking in

The Australian failed to make the cut after the first two days of play and was relaxing on Friday night

Rather than immediately return to work at the tour event in La Quinta, California, Allenby believes he would be wise to step away, having taken medical advice.

He said in a statement released by the PGA Tour: 'On the advice of my personal doctor, I have decided to withdraw from this week's Humana Challenge. This will enable me to ensure I am fully recovered prior to rejoining the PGA Tour. I anticipate a full recovery and look forward to returning in the near future.

'Once again, I would like to thank the local authorities in Hawaii as well as the PGA Tour for their assistance. I am also grateful for all the kind words of support I have received from so many people.

'Any further updates on the investigation will come from local law enforcement.'
