London was named the most visited city in the world in 2013 by the Office of National Statistics but controversially the English capital has been voted the second least welcoming.

In a random new survey nine per cent of ‘experienced travellers’ say Londoners are unfriendly towards tourists, with only the Parisians ranking worse.

Our chums across the Channel are renowned for being, erm, a tad standoffish.

But we're not sure Londoners will take too kindly to being lumped in the French.

Crack a smile: London has been voted the second least friendly city in the world, coming just above Paris

Lighting up: The UK capital was among four European cities to come out worst in the report

Money-saving
 website Coupon Code Pro conducted the poll, asking thousands of people 
which cities they’ve found the most and least welcoming.

Europe
 seems the most unfriendly place on the planet with Barcelona and Rome 
also featuring in the top five least welcoming cities.

But even more randomly crowded and chaotic New York got top spot in the most welcoming category.

1. New York City, USA – 11 per cent2. Beijing, China – 10 per cent3. Toronto, Canada – 8 per cent4. Amsterdam, Netherlands – 8 per cent5. Sydney, Australia – 7 per cent

1. Paris, France – 13 per cent2. London, UK – 9 per cent3. Barcelona, Spain – 8 per cent4. Rome, Italy – 5 per cent5. Tokyo, Japan – 3 per cent

New York welcome: Naked cowboy serenades tourist in Times Square

Perhaps it was the Naked Cowboy in Times Square that swung it.

The Big Apple got 11 per cent of the vote, with Beijing coming second and Toronto coming third.

Amsterdam made fourth position but perhaps its just the Red Light District that helped it make the top five.
