If Ted Cruz isn't running for president, his closest friends are setting up a super PAC for nothing. The 'Stand for Principle' PAC filed papers with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, and the organization's founder says it will be the go-to financial behemoth supporting the Texas senator in 2016.

Super PACs can raise unlimited amounts of money as long as they don't coordinate their activities with political campaigns. 

The emergence of a funding stream set up by Cruz supporter Maria Strollo Zack signals that the tea party firebrand is laying the groundwork for an announcement – and Zack plans to raise a ton of money.

'We'd like to be $50 million by the end of March 2016, going into Super Tuesday,' she told MailOnline on Wednesday.

NEXT UP, 2016: Ted Cruz spoke at a Texas Republican victory party after the GOP's historic Nov. 4 Senate gains, but has his eyes fixed on 2016 and the presidency

Stand for Principle isn't a so-called 'draft committee'; like those bearing the names of Hillary Clinton on the left and pediatric surgeon Ben Carson on the right.

Cruz's office in Washington declined comment.

While Cruz can't legally partner with Zack, his close lifelong friend David Panton gave the project a nod and will be its most visible volunteer.

A source close to the Stand for Principle PAC's formation told MailOnline that Panton, a Jamaican Rhodes Scholar who once roomed with Cruz at Princeton, chose the name.

Zack, the PAC's chairwoman, is a Georgia business development executive who said her firm's primary purpose is to help startup companies get off the ground.

That firm, The Strollo Group, also has a small government affairs arm that lobbies in Georgia.

The new political vehicle, she said, is the first effort supporting Cruz to get off the ground, and will enjoy the support of his closest friends and allies, mostly on the Republican Party's right wing.

MASTER OF RHETORIC: Cruz was quick to frame the White House's latest Internet policy in a way that connects it to the president's increasingly unpopular medical insurance overhaul

'The reason we're starting it,' Zack said, 'is that America craves, thirsts and hungers for strong, bold, principled conservative leadership.'

She was former House Speaker and fellow Georgian Newt Gingrich's southeast political director during the 2012 presidential primaries, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's state co-chair in 2008.

'Both campaigns won Georgia' in the Republican primaries,' she told MailOnline.

And now both Gingrich and Huckabee loyalists, she said, are 'looking for the right leaders who can win a general election.'

Huckabee may take another bite at the presidential apple himself in 2016, but he's considered a long shot. 

Cruz, by contrast, is poised to be a major player when the primary season gets off the ground just months from now. He spent the 2014 election season building alliances with Republican leaders in key early states and storing up chits with members of Congress. 

And his communications shop is a reliable source of daily-churning quotables written to keep him in the spotlight.

On Monday when the White House announced its support of a 'net neutrality' policy that the FCC has been working on for years, Cruz quipped that the idea was like 'Obamacare for the Internet.' 

Super PACs became a liberal playground in the 2014 election, but their incessant ad buys had little effect on Republican-friendly results in marquee U.S. Senate races.

The Center for Responsive Politics reports that liberal super PACs raised more than $337 million during the 2014 election cycle – 58 per cent more than their conservative counterparts.

Left-wing super PACs accounted for the three largest fundraising totals, $158 million in all. 

The two largest individual donors since 2013 were global warming warrior Tom Steyer and gun control advocate Michael Bloomberg, who put a combined $93 million into liberal super PACs.

Those numbers could all pale in comparison to what's about to begin. In the 2012 presidential contest, super PACs raised more than $858 million.

Two groups supporting Mitt Romney raised nearly one-third of the total.

Cruz has emerged as a rock star on the political right, calling for a total repeal of the Obamacare medical insurance overhaul law and loudly opposing President Barack Obama's promised 'amnesty' for millions of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally.

A 'Draft Ted Cruz for President' super PAC was formed eight months ago, but has raised less than $380,000 and only has $15,708 in its bank account, according to FEC records. Its online petition has collected fewer than 18,000 signatures.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has at least seven separate super PACs jockeying for position. The biggest, 'Ready for Hillary,' has raised more than $10.2 million and spent 93 per cent of it already.

But even that pile of cash is one-upped by the $11 million raised by the 'Draft Ben Carson for President' committee, a group that the conservative doctor has disavowed.
