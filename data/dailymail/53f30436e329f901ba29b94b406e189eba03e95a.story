This is the shocking moment an arsonist was caught on CCTV setting fire to newspapers on the top deck of a bus before leaving it to burn - causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.

West Midlands Police  released the footage in a bid to trace the young man who set light to the papers on a double decker bus in Erdlington, Birmingham, on Tuesday. 

The youngster, who can be seen wearing a navy blue Parka jacket, white shirt and tie, appears to use a lighter to set a corner of the paper alight before calmly getting up and leaving at the next stop.

The blaze took hold on the rear seat of the upper deck of the number 904 in Erdington around 4pm on Tuesday as fire crews raced to the High Street.

Passengers were evacuated, but the top deck was gutted as smoke billowed from the windows, causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.

Investigating officer Sergeant Gareth Snyman said: 'This is a completely mindless act of vandalism that has caused thousands of pounds worth of damage as well as disruption to passengers and other motorists.

'I would appeal to anyone who knows the lad on the CCTV to contact me urgently on 101. Equally I would ask the person responsible to come forward and own up to his actions.'

Anyone not wishing to speak to police can give information anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

The youth can then be seen calmly walking away from the fire - he is wearing a navy Parka, shirt and tie
