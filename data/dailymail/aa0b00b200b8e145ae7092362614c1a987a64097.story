Crime scenes can be notoriously difficult to examine without disturbing the evidence, yet one police service in Australia has come up with a novel solution.

Officers from Queensland are using a handheld 3D scanner to perfectly record computer models of indoor and outdoor scenes of crime.

Called Zebedee, because of the way it moves like its namesake in The Magic Roundabout, the scanner has previously been used to produce models of famous landmarks and shipwrecks, yet this is the first time the technology has been used to fight crime.

Zebedee works by emitting laser beams while rotating around a spring that continuously scans the environment. This converts 2D measurements into a 3D field of view. Using data collected by the scanner, police in Queensland have been able to quickly recreate indoor scenes, like the one pictured, on a computer

Zebedee works by emitting laser beams while rotating around a spring that continuously scans the environment.

This
 converts 2D measurements into a 3D field of view and is capable of 
collecting over 40,000 range measurements in just one second.

Using data collected by the scanner, police investigators can quickly recreate the scene on a computer in 3D.

They
 can locate and tag evidence, pinpoint particular areas of interest and 
rotate the room or landscape to view it from any angle.

'The benefits of [Zebedee] will reduce interference at a scene, save time and allow access to previously hard to reach areas such as step declines and bushland,â€™ said Queensland Police Service Commissioner Ian Stewart.

'This cutting edge technology is allowing us to adapt to a new environment of ongoing change and improvement.'

Crime scenes are renowned for being difficult to investigate due to the delicate nature of preserving evidence. Equally, outdoor crime scenes including dense forests, caves, or other vast areas can be time consuming to examine thoroughly.

Using Zebedee, also known as ZEB1, 
police can now easily access these hard to reach places and map confined
 spaces where it may be difficult to set up bulky camera equipment and 
tripods.

It also means less disturbance of the crime scene and scans can be uploaded in almost real-time.

Unlike wheeled mobile systems, Zebedee can operate on stairways and rough terrain and the system is also accurate in areas without GPS.

Zebedee works in a similar way to the mapping drones seen in sci-fi film Prometheus (2012). It scans the environment and uses the images it collects to build 3D interactive models

The technology was created by Brisbane-based firm Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in 2010.

Zebedee has previously been used to capture world heritage sites in a bid to preserve them. It was recently used to scan the complex interior of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, for example.

It is now available commercially and its makers are working on ways it can be used in forestry, mining and classroom learning.
