Gone is the bouffant hair and vivid lipstick that fans of Designing Women star Delta Burke will remember.

Instead, as the rarely-seen actress, 58, stepped out to lunch with her longtime husband Gerald McRaney in Studio City, California, she sported a simple brunette bob and a relatively make-up free face.

Delta has been out of the spotlight since a fall on the set of her pilot, Counter Culture, in 2012, led to the show being scrapped.

But breaking her silence, she told MailOnline that she is more than happy with life despite the fact there is 'no work on the horizon', adding: 'Everything is fine, I'm just not very exciting right now!'

No more Suzanne Sugarbaker! Designing Women star Delta Burke steps out to lunch with her husband Gerald McRaney looking slim and make-up free

Heyday: Delta Burke rocks a bouffant, sequins and red lips at the Academy of Country Music Awards in 1987

Looking slim, Delta enjoyed a salad lunch at Art's Delicatessen last week, where fellow diners included Tori Spelling and Leah Remini.

She has been married to Gerard, best known for TV's Major Dad, since 1989 and has battled depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and 'hoarding' - all for which she sought treatment at a psychiatric hospital in 2008. 

She has also suffered very public weight battles, but has said that after 25 years of marriage: 'Mac loves me no matter what.

'He loved me when I got as big as a house. He loved me when I was a blonde. He didn't tell me he hated it until I went back to brunette. He has loved me through my up times and my down times. He still thinks my body looks great, and I can certifiably tell you it does not!'

A quiet life: Delta Burke told MailOnline that she was happy, laughing: 'I'm just not very exciting right now!'

Delta rose to fame as Suzanne Sugarbaker in 1980s TV hit Designing Women, which centered around the lives of four Southern women and one man in an interior design firm.

She was nominated for two Emmy awards for the role, but left the show in 1991 after a row with her bosses.

Appearances on shows including Boston Legal followed.

In 2012, she was set to make her comeback on on an ABC sitcom Counter Culture, which was to follow three aging sisters running a family diner together in West Texas and starring Kerri Kenney, Margo Martindale as well as Doris Roberts. 

However, after Burke fell on the set, production of the pilot was suspended and it was not picked up to series. 

Asked if there were any projects on the horizon, Delta told MailOnline there was nothing on the horizon - but said she was happy.
