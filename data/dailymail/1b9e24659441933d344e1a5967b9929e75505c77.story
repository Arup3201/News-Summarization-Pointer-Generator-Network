Sachin Tendulkar is left in no doubt that the Indian Super League can become as big as any other tournament in the footballing world.

The 41-year-old, speaking at Lord’s during the launch of his new autobiography ‘Playing It My Way’, was forthright in his view that the ISL is capable of making an impact on the sport’s landscape in years to come.

Tendulkar has a vested interest in its continued emergence after winning a bid to co-own Kochi’s Kerala Blasters - the side to have landed former England goalkeeper David James as both their coach and marquee player.

They also boast former Football League stalwarts Iain Hume, Michael Chopra, Stephen Pearson and Jamie McAllister.

Involvement in the business is something the Little Master will continue to press ahead with after retiring from cricket this time last year. The franchise division has already attracted a host of other stars from across the globe - in a similar vein to cricket’s IPL.

Robert Pires, Freddie Ljungberg, Alessandro Del Piero and David Trezeguet have all signed up for the inaugural campaign.

‘Internationally, football is really really big. In India we have all the potential to make football as big as anywhere else in the world,’ he said.

‘Football is definitely not as big as cricket in India, but I see it getting really big in times to come. The response to the ISL has been incredible.’

Any new franchise is met with an air of scepticism - there are suggestions that older players want one last payday before calling time on their careers - but Tendulkar is adamant that the sporting hunger of those in his homeland will see to it that football in India will thrive.

And it’s clear that a ringing endorsement from an individual so many in India worship because of his skills with the bat carries quite some weight.

Tendulkar - who notched more Test runs and centuries than anyone else - was at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Thursday to watch Kerala beat FC Goa.

‘I was in Kerala yesterday [Thursday] evening. I was asked a couple of questions and I couldn’t hear the compere because the crowd was so loud.

‘The response has been really strong. People want to support football and its players in India - and make it a big sport.’

Despite boasting a population over more than one billion, they have never qualified for a World Cup and won’t be in Australia for January’s Asian Cup and lag behind other countries - notably Oman, Iraq and Palestine.

Tendulkar sees the bigger picture, however, and hopes the start of the ISL will bring on a generation of younger players to begin challenging for tournament qualification.

‘Its not going to happen overnight. It requires work from all directions,’ he added. ‘That’s what we are trying to do: support the players and give them a platform to realise their dreams.
