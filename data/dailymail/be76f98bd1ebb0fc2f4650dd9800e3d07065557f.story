In Chicago they're rightly proud of their deep-dish style of pizza and so the city recently had a public vote to determine which restaurant served up the best.

The winner by an impressive margin was Lou Malnati’s Pizzeria and the staff choose to celebrate their emphatic victory with a celebration straight from the football field.

Owner Marc Malnati couldn't wait to share the good news and is seen in a YouTube clip posted by the restaurant marching into one of the business’s kitchens.

After Lou Malnati's Pizzeria has been voted Chicago's 'Best Deep Dish pizza', owner Marc Malnati couldn't wait to share the good news

As Malnati shares news of the victory he is greeted with loud cheers and high-fives, but then his employees 'surprise' him by dumping a tub of the restaurant's special cold tomato sauce all over his head

As Malnati shares news of the victory he is greeted with loud cheers and high-fives, but then his employees ‘surprise’ him by dumping a tub of the restaurant's special cold tomato sauce all over his head.

The celebration follows the time-honored sports tradition of drenching someone with a vat of the Gatorade after a big win.

Unfortunately for Malnati he receives a shower of thick and sticky pizza sauce, rather than a sports drink-style soaking.

The boss seems to take his dunking very well and by the looks of this elaborate video, he was probably in on the joke from the start. 

'What happened to Gatorade?' Unfortunately for Malnati he received a shower of thick and sticky pizza sauce rather than the sports drink

One employee couldn't resist getting his hands dirty and massaged the tomato sauce into his bosses' hair

Still he's a good sport about it all and jokingly asks, 'What happened to Gatorade?' before barking ‘get back to work!’ at his staff.

Approximately 50,000 people voted in the poll conducted by Eater Chicago.

With 51 percent of the vote, Lou Malnati’s beat out other Chicago deep dish staples Pizzeria Uno, Gino’s East, and Giordano’s. Only Gino’s East came close, with nearly 40 percent of the vote.

Legend has it that Chicago-style deep-dish pizza was invented at Pizzeria Uno, in Chicago, in 1943, either by Uno's founder Ike Sewell or the restaurant's original pizza chef Rudy Malnati.

The first Lou Malnati's Pizzeria opened in 1971 and now there are 37 branches throughout Chicago and the surrounding suburbs

As the name suggests, the crust is very deep, creating a very thick pizza that resembles a pie more than a flat-bread New York-style pizza.

Lou Malnati began working with his father Rudy in the 1940s making deep-dish pizza and in the 1950s they co-managed Pizzeria Uno.

Then in 1971, Lou and his wife Jean opened the first Lou Malnati's Pizzeria in Lincolnwood, Illinois.

There are now 37 branches of the pizzeria throughout Chicago and the surrounding suburbs.
