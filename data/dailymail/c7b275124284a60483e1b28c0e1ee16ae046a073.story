A porn star was hired by the BBC to feature in the Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleine McCann’s disappearance, it was today revealed.

Adult actor Mark Sloan was cast as Matthew Oldfield, one of the 'Tapas Seven', who were eating at a restaurant with Gerry and Kate McCann the night Maddie disappeared.

The actor has reportedly starred in previous Crimewatch reconstructions as well as X rated films Tight Rider, Sherlock Bones and From Dusk Till Porn.

Media campaign groups and family charities have expressed surprise at the casting - suggesting it was 'inappropriate'

He has also appeared on adult channels Playboy TV and Television X, the Mirror reports.

Police have been chasing new leads in the Madeleine McCann case after being swamped by almost 1,000 tip-offs from the public following the show.

Detectives are working their way through 730 calls and 212 emails following the biggest ever response to an appeal on BBC Crimewatch.

A number of callers gave names for the man police believe snatched Madeleine from her bed minutes before her mother Kate found she was missing.

Crimewatch's Madeline McCann special was the most watched edition of the BBC show in its 29 year history, attracting more than seven million viewers.

Media campaign groups and family charities have expressed surprise at the casting.

Mothers Against Murder and 
Aggression, told the paper: 'We are surprised that the BBC employed the 
services of someone who has openly worked in the sex industry for 
something as sensitive as this reconstruction.'

Vivienne Pattison, of family values group Mediawatch, said it was not the most appropriate of castings.

A spokesman for the McCanns declined to comment.

On a casting website, Mr Sloan said that he was once in the British Army and was posted to Northern Ireland. He also says he performs nude only in 'professional' circumstances. 

The BBC has today declined to comment to MailOnline.
