Buffalo was  bracing itself on Sunday for devastating flooding as weather forecasters predicted only the second white Thanksgiving in New York City in 75-years. 

The snow, due to strike on Wednesday, would be the first time the city has seen the white stuff on Thanksgiving in 25 years, with the last being in 1989, weather expert Dr Roy Spencer, said. 

Upward of six inches could fall in areas that are west of I-95 - and New York City, as well as Washington, D.C., and Boston, are among them, Accuweather reported.

The severity of a storm along the East Coast during the middle of this week will be based on its proximity to the coast, the weather source reported. 

On the shores of Lake Erie, warming temperatures began to melt up to seven feet of snow that struck upstate New York in a series of deadly snowstorms.

In a message to locals, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo warned those in flood-prone areas to move their valuables out of the basement, pack bags and prepare for the possibility of evacuation.

'Err on the side of caution,' he said at a news conference in Cheektowaga today. 'You prepare for the worst and hope for the best, and that's what we're doing.' 

Gov Cuomo described the predicted flooding as 'phase two of this battle with Mother Nature', adding that officials have dozens of boats, pumps, and a huge 176,500 sandbags at the ready.

As a backup to Red Cross shelters, he said the state would have shelters at community colleges and state university campuses, according to CBS affiliate WIVB in Buffalo.

But he added: 'Hopefully we need none of this. Hopefully this was just an elaborate exercise in logistics. We hope to get back to business on Monday.

'Government offices will be open. Schools will be open. We are sending teams of structural engineers in to inspect any school that might have the potential of a structural problem.'

And the governor's wishes may yet come true as creeks appeared to be flowing smoothly and no flooding had been reported as the sun began to go down, county officials said.

More than 775 members of the New York National Guard are currently in Erie county and Buffalo to aid with the wide-scale snow removal and flood prevention efforts.

With help from hundreds of volunteers, they are clearing snow-covered roads and digging out homes and vehicles buried in snow following the record storms that killed 13 people.

Roofs collapsed and some people were stuck in their cars for more than 24 hours when the heaviest snow fall in memory hit areas of New York state along the Great Lakes.

Earlier today, it emerged that a mother who was trapped in her car for 13 hours wrote goodbye letters to her daughters as her struggle for survival became increasingly desperate. 

Danger: Rain could sink into snow on roofs around Buffalo, making it heavier and putting them under strain

Karen Rossi, 47, became stuck in a snowbank while driving home from work at a Buffalo hospital last week. She was trapped for good when a passing snowplow heaped up even more snow around her, the Buffalo News reported.

The stricken mother wound down the window and used a sweatshirt to cover her hands as she dug round to the tailpipe so she could keep the engine running without poisoning herself.

She spent 13 hours - from 3am until 4pm - trapped with no way to see the outside. In  desperation, she fished a scrap of paper out of her purse and wrote notes to both of her two daughters.

Ultimately she was able to summon help by pushing away enough snow to stick a red brush out and wave it for attention. The brush was seen by a passing monster truck driver, who shoveled her out.

Rossi later offered to show the letters to her daughters, but both have refused for the time being. 

The November storm system, dubbed the 'Knife Storm,' lasted for three days.

Thirteen people died in the snowstorms. At least one was found dead in their car in a fate similar to the one Rossie narrowly avoided.

Others died of exposure or from heart attacks caused while shoveling snow. Two elderly people died during an evacuation of their nursing home.

The National Weather Service said roads could flood quickly from snow melt since the storm blocked drains, and issued warnings for potential flooding of four rivers and creeks.

'Snowmelt is well underway and will continue through Monday,' the weather service said on its website. 'It is this snowmelt that will ultimately cause the flooding concerns.' 

Eric Burr, public affairs director for the Division of Military and Naval Affairs for New York state, added: 'The focus right now is still snow removal.

'There's a lot of snow still on the ground and the key is to get rid of snow especially around drains so that water doesn't back up.' 

Flood warnings were in effect as the NWS said higher temperatures - rising to 50 degrees  on Sunday and 60 on Monday - could rapidly unlock up to six inches of water.

As the dinner hour set in, no flooding had been reported, Erie County spokesman Peter Anderson said in an email.

'Resources are being staged for quick deployment and all eyes are on the creeks,' he said. 'The weather is warmer and snow is melting, but creeks are flowing well.' 

Ellen Przepasniak, spokeswoman for the Erie County emergency operations effort, said sandbags would be quickly deployed to cities and towns that report rising waters.

The state has provided some 3,000 tons of sand to fill the bags, Anderson said.

Inmates from the Erie County Jail holding center were filling sandbags in a parking lot, as New York city firefighters loaded boats into the backs of pickups and dump trucks.

National Guard deployed front-end loaders, dump trucks and airfield-grade snow-removal trucks for snow removal, as well as tractor-trailers, 20
