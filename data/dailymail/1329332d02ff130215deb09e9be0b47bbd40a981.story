Parents disillusioned with the school system have sold their house and pulled their children out of classes - to take them on a year-long educational road trip of the UK in a caravan.

Amy and Ella Meek, aged 11 and nine, will attend 'road school' supervised by their mother and father who are both teachers from Arnold, Nottingham.

The girls will swap classrooms and formal tests for trips to castles, museums and libraries up and down the country.

The trip, which will take at least a year, will take in the likes of Stonehenge, the Scilly Isles and salmon rivers in Scotland

The trip, which will take at least a year, will take in Stonehenge, the Scilly Isles and salmon rivers in Scotland.

Father Tim and mother Kerry quit their jobs and sold their house to fund the trip, which will cover up to 20,000 miles.

Most schoolchildren are now back at school facing a controversial new National Curriculum which requires five-year-olds to learn fractions and pupils in early secondary school to study Shakespeare.

But the Meek family are in Peterborough where lessons include a science project looking at the mechanics of a trebuchet - a type of catapult used in the Middle Ages.

Mr Meek, who quit his role at Derrymount Special School, Arnold, Nottingham, said: 'Children are not sausages in a sausage factory to be pumped full of facts and content ready for regurgitation at the end of some arbitrary Key Stage, when they take high-stakes assessments.

'We've given ourselves a minimum of an academic year but we are realistic and we know the girls will return to school at some point.

For the girls' first day of 'road school' on Monday, they visited historic Warwick Castle in Warwickshire (pictured)

'It's one of those things that's scary and people say you are brave, or silly. One thing we do know is that it's going to be a year to remember.'

The 45-year-old stressed that he and wife Kerry, 39, were not unhappy with staff at the school, or at Richard Bonington Primary and Nursery in Arnold, Nottingham, where the girls attended. 

'Education is becoming overly dominated with tests, assessments and targets, at the expense of rich, engaging and enjoyable learning,' said Mr Meek, who has budgeted to spend £20,000 on the trip.

Amy is looking forward to what the family have labeled an 'ed-venture'.

She said: 'In school we were having tests all the time. We'd read from a book and just repeat it.

'We are going to have more freedom now and we'll still learn the important things like English and maths.'

The Meeks insist they don't blame teachers, schools or even local authorities for their disenchantment with conventional schooling.

Instead they say Government policies do not cater for the day-to-day needs of children and that youngsters are taught simply to pass exams.

The Meeks, pictured, have shown their adventurous side in the past and last year set their daughters a challenge of completing 50 new outdoor activities in 12 months

The 11-year-old added: 'I always felt like I was working towards a test. I had my SATs last year and we were reminded about them almost every day. It's like we just read from the book and repeated it for the test.'

For the girls' first day of 'road school' on Monday, they visited historic Warwick Castle.

Mr Meek added: 'We used the visit to Warwick Castle as the stimulus and asked the girls what questions they wanted answering. It's more engaging because they're inside the fascinating castle walls.'

The girls were then set assignments to follow-up the trip and asked to carry out some educational research.

Mike Fortune-Wood, of Home Education UK, said pupils taught outside of school tended to fare better than state school students. 

On the road: The family have set off from Arnold in Nottinghamshire and have already taken in trips to Warwick Castle and Peterborough

They will also take in Stonehenge during the tour. The children are likely to return to school after the 'ed-venture'

He said: 'Home schooling is easier in many ways because it's one-on-one. The children don't waste hours listening while the teacher explains something to 30-odd other kids in the class. They can go at their own pace.' 

One criticism of home schooling is that children don't get as much social interaction with their peers.

Ella, nine, said she was already missing her friends - although she thinks they would love to be doing what she is.

'I'm trying not to think about leaving my friends,' said Ella. 

'But I think most of them would like to be exploring castles instead of sitting at a desk at school.'

'It's easy to keep in touch,' added Amy. 

'I will miss my friends but we have social media and things like Skype to keep in contact. It's not like we're never coming back to Nottingham - we will visit.'

Nottinghamshire County Council's education standards service director, John Slater, said: 'We respect the parents’ wishes in this case to provide alternative education for their children. 

'As both are high attaining children we have no concerns and we wish them every success.'
