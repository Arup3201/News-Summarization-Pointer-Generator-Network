The former bandmates of Lostprophets’ frontman Ian Watkins have told how they would have ‘killed him’ had they known he was a serial paedophile and child sex abuser.

Watkins, 36, was sent to prison for 35 years last December after being convicted of a string of child sex offences - including the attempted rape of a fan's baby.

His ex-bandmates, who have now formed a new group called No Devotion due to Lostprophets’ name being tarnished beyond repair, have spoken out about their shock and despair at learning of the rocker’s despicable crimes.

The former bandmates of disgraced Lostprophets vocalist Ian Watkins have told how they would have 'killed him' had they known about his paedophile ways. Pictured together at the Kerrang! Awards in 2010: (from left) Lee Gaze, Stuart Richardson, Mike Lewis, Ian Watkins and Luke Johnson

Lee Gaze, Mike Lewis, Stuart Richardson, Jamie Oliver and Luke Johnson, who are all from Pontypridd, south Wales, said they had no idea about the vocalist's paedophile ways.

Guitarist Gaze said: ‘How could you know?

‘Who would disclose such a thing to five people, who between them have eight children? You just wouldn't because they would be killed on the spot.’

Speaking to Radio 1's newsbeat, he said the band members were hit by two waves of shock – firstly when Watkins was arrested in December 2012 and a year later when he finally pleaded guilty.

He said: ‘There was two sets of shock because there were the accusations - which was one thing. And then there was the actual, “Yeah I did do it” which was a year later.

‘He dragged that out for a year, so we got hit by it twice."

Bassist Stuart Richardson added: ‘Even though I was completely done with him (by this stage), I hoped it was all a mistake, he was innocent, he had to be.

‘The first time, we knew the band was done. You can't go back from that.’

Towards the end of Lostprophets, Gaze said that Watkins had become increasingly distant from the band.

‘He was doing his own thing,’ he said.

‘That just grew worse over the years, the more he was using drugs.

‘He could be in the same city as me and I wouldn't hang out with him, even if we weren't playing shows.’

Watkins was handed a 29-year prison term - with an extended licence of six years - after pleading guilty to 13 sexual offences at Cardiff Crown Court.

The offences included the attempted rape of an 11-month old child as well as encouraging a fan to abuse her baby via webcam.

Police also found a stash of child porn videos - some of which he had made himself.

Earlier this month, he was refused application to appeal his sentence after he tried to argue his sex crimes were 'not the worst'.

His former bandmates are now trying to move forward with their new band No Devotion, with the help of singer Geoff Rickly who they have enlisted as their vocalist.

They are currently in the middle of recording their debut album and said they have been overwhelmed by the support they have been getting.

Rhythm guitarist Lewis said: ‘It was vindication almost that we were there and we are doing this and we do have an incredible support from people.

‘It's been incredibly cathartic.

‘It's time to move on and we just want to focus on that from here on in.’

Watkins' has been described as a 'sexual predator'

Watkins was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court in December last year and told he would have to serve at least 35 years before being considered for release.

The court heard that after sexually touching a fan's 11-month-old baby, Watkins tried to have penetrative sex with the child.

He also encouraged a second fan to abuse her child during a webcam chat and secretly stashed child porn videos, some of which he had made himself.

Sentencing judge Mr Justice Royce told Watkins: 'Those who have appeared in these courts over many years see a large number of horrific cases. This case, however, breaks new ground.

'I am satisfied that you are a deeply corrupting influence, you are highly manipulative, you are a sexual predator, you are dangerous.'

After pleading guilty to the charges, Watkins, 36, sent a message to a fan joking about the offences.

'I am going to put a statement out just to say it was mega lolz,' he said. 'I don't know what everyone is getting so freaked out about.'
