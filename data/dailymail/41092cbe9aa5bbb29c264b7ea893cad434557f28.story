Lord Ashdown told the Lib Dem conference he believed the British public would vote to stay in the EU

Britain is now ‘irretrievably’ on course hold a referendum on membership of the EU, Paddy Ashdown warned Nick Clegg today as the party sought to defend its pro-European credentials.

Former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown insisted he was a ‘passionate’ European and still hoped that Britain would one day join the euro single currency.

And he revealed he had told Mr Clegg that he believed a referendum was inevitable after David Cameron wielded the British veto to block an EU treaty change in December last year.

‘We were now irretrievably on the way to a European referendum,’ Lord Ashdown said today.

The admission is likely to be seized on by Eurosceptics in the Tory party who have repeatedly called for Mr Cameron to commit to holding a vote.

However, Lord Ashdown beleives the British public would not vote to abandon Brussels: ‘Provided we have that referendum on in or out, it can be won.’

Lord Ashdown was speaking at a fringe event at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton, where he warned the currency crisis meant future shape of Europe was not yet clear.

Critics have complained that there is no foreign affairs debate in the main conference hall, weeks after Mr Clegg gave up a ministerial role in the Foreign Office in exchange for a Lib Dem being farming minister.

Lord Ashdown said: ‘I don’t think we have yet understood the terms of existence of the European Union.’

But if Britain becomes more detached politically from the continent it would be like ‘corks floating around behind other peoples ocean liners’.

He predicted the Eurozone will eventually shrink, leaving just Germany, Austria, the Benelux countries, Finland and France.

‘I am a passionate European. We have to be passionate. As Europe moves, as it must, towards deeper federalism… this is a dance we have to sit aside from.

'We need to do it with apologies and regret but the Tories will do it with scorn.

‘If it should ever become in Britain’s interests to join the Europe,, I am in favour of us doing so.’
