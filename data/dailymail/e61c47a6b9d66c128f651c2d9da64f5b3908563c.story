Large shards of ice continued to fall from One World Trade Center in lower Manhattan this weekend, yet authorities failed to close off nearby streets or the PATH station to protect passersby.

Pedestrians and those using the train had to scurry for cover Saturday as daggers of ice slid off the nation's tallest building at an estimated 100 mph.

Meanwhile, a new video has emerged showing the frightening ice splinters falling from the sky in March 2013 - proving the sloped Freedom Tower's design flaw was first spotted a year ago.

On Friday, the tumbling ice forced the World Trade Center PATH station to grind to a halt at morning rush hour and officials cordoned off the area for half an hour. The north pool of the 9/11 Memorial was also closed for several hours.

But the station was kept open over the weekend and people in the streets had to fend for themselves.

'We just saw ice falling down the building,' Austrian tourist Katharina Amann, 24, told the New York Daily News. 'It was scary. Then I heard it shatter.'

There have been no reported injuries in the ice shower, but Port Authority officials said they were keeping a close eye on the situation.

'Each incident was fully investigated and proper protocols were followed,' spokesman Steve Coleman told the Daily News. 'Ice falling from buildings occurs in urban environments such as Manhattan, and we are taking all appropriate safety measures when the situation arises.'

Street food vendor Mohammed Mohammed, 32, said four chunks of ice landed on his truck, which he parks across the street from 7 World Trade Center.

'There was a big bang,' he told the Daily News. 'It was worse than rocks. The ice is sharp like a knife. It was shattering like glass. If someone got hit with it, it would really hurt.'

Columbia University physicist Professor Jeremy Dodd estimated the ice would be falling about 100 mph and told the Daily News it could cause 'pretty catastrophic damage' if the ice hit someone on the head.

Design flaws on the sloped 1,776-foot-tall glass building have been blamed for the dangerous falling ice because the angle of the glass acts as a ski jump, witnesses told the New York Daily News. 'The ice just comes down the side and shoots off,' a PATH worker told the newspaper Friday.

An initial video of the ice shows it falling from the very top of the building and raining down on the streets and station below.

The Exchange Place PATH station, in Jersey City directly across the Hudson River from the World Trade Center, was also closed Friday morning for falling ice, according to WCBS.

The busy subway station's main entrance was shut just before 9 a.m., with the rest of the area shutdown a short time later.  All but a memorial pool were reopened by 9:30 a.m.

The closure was chaotic because the doors were sealed shut but trains kept unloading thousands of passengers from Newark and Hoboken into the quickly filling platforms and concourses.

Passengers were routed through an alternate exit to Brookfield Place, formerly the World Financial Center, away from most offices and all possible subway connections, according to Gothamist.

Several people told the website that no announcements were being made over the PA system and that people were being herded in the complete opposite direction from the vast majority of them wanted to go.

Many people were grumpy, but one Jersey City woman saw the bright side of the minor inconvenience.

'I don't really mind if it's for safety,' Maya Baramidze told the Wall Street Journal.

It took almost half an hour for the Port Authority to suspend PATH service into the station, but the crowds were already overflowing and the damage had been done.

'PATH gets a zero for their performance today,' a man identified only as Jeff told Gothamist. 'Poor communication and poor handling of the situation.'

This is not the first time falling ice has caused problems at the massive building. People were sent running for cover in March 2013 as shards of ice showered nearby Vescey Street.

The PATH train is an underground subway that connects the New Jersey cities of Hoboken, Jersey City and Newark with midtown and Lower Manhattan.

It is the seventh-busiest transit system in the country, according to a recent transit industry report.
