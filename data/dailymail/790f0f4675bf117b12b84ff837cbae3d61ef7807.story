A bow-hunter in Washington says he was attacked by a black bear while looking for deer.

Jerry Hause, 61, and his 26-year-old son Jeffrey were out on a hunt Monday when he decided to sit down to rest for a minute.

That's when he saw the black bear coming at him at a dead run.

'I stood up and in one motion that bear jumped out of the creek it was in and was on level ground with me,' Hause, of Longview, told The Daily News.

'And as soon as it was on level ground it was on a dead run after me.'

Jerry Hause is an avid outdoorsman, but running away from a black bear was a first for him

Hause is an avid outdoorsman who's been hunting for decades — but having started bow hunting just four years ago, he didn't think he'd have time and the skills to pick up his bow and shoot the charging bear.

Instead, he scrambled up a tree while the animal, which appeared to be 250 to 300 pounds, closed in on him.

'I knew the tree was right there, so I headed up that to get far enough up the tree that the bear couldn’t get me,' Hause told The Daily News.

He thought he was out of the bear's reach.

He was wrong.

'It totally amazes me how fast that bear got on me,' Hause he told the newspaper. 'In three seconds it was on me.'

The black bear bit and clawed against the hunter's left leg — and didn't let go until Hause kicked it in the snout with his right foot.

'I was thinking, "If it gets me out of this tree I’m a dead man,"' he told The Daily News. 'It was mad, it was growling, it was serious about what it was going to do.'

But amazingly, the bear let go after the kick, dropped to the ground and moved on.

Hause waited around for a while and was eventually able to walk out and call for help.

He was treated for puncture wounds and claw scratches at a hospital and is recovering at home.

Wildlife experts say black bears usually run away when they hear people. This unusual level of aggression indicates the bear may have been a mother protecting its cubs.

Local officials planned on euthanizing the bear — but Hause convinced them otherwise because of the likelihood it was a just a frightened animal acting our of motherly instincts.

'It either had cubs out there or I was threatening its food,' he told The Daily News. 'It’s bear country. They live in the woods. I don’t.'

For his part, Hause has learned his lesson: next time he goes bow hunting, he plans to carry a pistol.
