Carl Froch knocked out bitter rival George Groves with a lethal right hand in the eighth round, then set his sights on a title defence in Las Vegas next.

There was talk of Froch hanging up his gloves after this hugely anticipated rematch with Groves, but straight after victory – which put to bed any of the question marks from the controversial stoppage of Groves in their last bout – he was already talking of fighting on.

'I'd love to box in Las Vegas,' Froch, 36, declared. 'It ticks a special box for me. I've fought in America a few times but Vegas is the fight capital and it's something I've never done.

Champion: Carl Froch says he dreams of a fight in Las Vegas after he beat George Groves at Wembley

Out: The IBF and WBA world super-middleweight champion floored Groves in the eighth round at Wembley

'I will never top fighting at Wembley in front of 80,000. My kids will look back on this, they'll say that was my daddy and he defended world title. This evening will never be topped.

'But I'd like to fight in vegas. The opponent? Who knows? I'll leave that up to Rob McCracken.

'I have defended my world title 13 times on the spin. I am amongst the elite. And I showed that against Groves.

'The finish showed why I mix it with the elite and how hard it is to get to that level.'

The finish was incredible. Groves was arguably ahead on points in the fight until the eighth round when Froch landed one of the punches of his career.

He first padded Groves's right cheek with a left jab then hurled his right fist with unstoppable fury to take the Londoner out.

Groves buckled and his left leg bent awkwardly underneath. The referee did not even need to count him out.

'I had been working on that right hand for three months,' Froch added. 'This was tactical. We had a game plan and it was executed perfectly.'

James DeGale is now the mandatory challenger after defeating Brandon Gonzales, but Froch will take a break before deciding who to face next.

Groves, who suffered the second defeat of his young career, vowed to come back and keep fighting.

'I'd love to come again,' the 26-year-old said. 'I think I was ahead on the score card until that point.

'I'll be pushing hard to get my world title fight and maybe if Carl is still boxing it'll be Carl again.

'I'm young enough and I will come again, I will learn and improve.

'I made a mistake, a silly mistake, left my chin open. We want to be perfect, all the imperfections need to be perfected.'
