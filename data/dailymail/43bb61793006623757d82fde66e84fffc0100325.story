A version of the British reality show One Born Every Minute has been banned in Berlin after politicians ruled it was an invasion of privacy for newborn babies.

The popular fly-on-the-wall show, which has been an international hit and is broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK, follows staff and patients on a busy maternity ward.

Berlin's state government decided to stop private broadcaster RTL from filming a copy of the show in the city-owned Vivantes hospital.

RTL planned a series called Wilkommen im Leben - or Baby Boom - but was told to move its cameras out of the hospital.

At least 30 had been set up in the capital's Friedrichshain hospital to film mothers-to-be, their families and even their births, as well as staff.

It promised that the end result would give 'authentic glimpses in the world of real feelings'.

Those mothers who signed up to take part in the show would have their babies in separate areas of the hospital and be filmed.

But just over a week after filming 
had begun, the city's politicians instructed the hospital to shut down 
the operation - to protect the privacy of the babies being born.

'Even
if the mothers and their families have given their consent to the 
filming, the child will likely be confronted with the footage later in 
life,' said Mario Czaja, Berlin state health minister.

RTL said yesterday it was surprised by the decision, and that all legal questions had been worked out well in advance between the producers and the hospital.Â 

One Born Every Minute is in its fourth series in the UK, which is filmed on two busy labour wards in Leeds: Leeds General Infirmary and St. James's Hospital.

The series has consistently garnered ratings, attracting more than three million viewers and more than a 12 per cent of the audience share.

The first series won a BAFTA in 2010 and was nominated again
in 2011. Versions of it have also been shown in the U.S., France and Sweden.
