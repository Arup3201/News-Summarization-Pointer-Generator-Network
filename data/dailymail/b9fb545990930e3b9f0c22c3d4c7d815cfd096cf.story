The wealthy family of the real-estate developer whose wife is pregnant with Simon Cowell's baby refused to go to their wedding, it has been claimed.

Socialite Lauren Silverman, 36, who is now 10 weeks pregnant with the music mogul's child, married Andrew Silverman, 37, in their mid 20s.

But now Andrew - a 
close friend of Cowell's - has filed for divorce, naming Cowell as a co-respondent in the papers and listing adultery as the cause of the ending of the marriage.

Revealing that Andrew's parents, weathly real-estate owner Allen Silverman and his wife Eleonore, always had concerns about the relationship, a source said: 'Andrew's parents boycotted their wedding because they had their doubts 
about Lauren, she thought she was suspect.'

Betrayal: Andrew and Lauren Silverman, pictured in January 2013, were married for 10 years. Their marriage ended following her affair with Cowell with whom she now has a baby son, Eric

An acquaintance told the New York Post: 'I always found her very pretty, but I 
found them to be very pretentious. And I always wondered why she married him.'

Andrew works 
alongside his father Allen, who founded property company The Andalex 
Group by combining his sons names, Andrew and Alexander, in the 1980s.

Both brothers now work for the firm and have been named as rising stars in New York real-estate scene.

The family own a string of Manhattan apartments as well as a $4.5million country home in Stamford, Connecticut.

On Thursday 
morning, Lauren was photographed dropping the couple's
son at the school bus outside the $4 million family home in Bridgehampton, New 
York, where she is hiding out.

Lauren, who was dressed casually and wore flip flops, dark colored shorts, a loose fitting white shirt and a light blue cap, smiled as she spoke to a friend in the driveway before returning to the house.

A family friend had said that Lauren would come to the end of the drive and speak if she wanted to but instead she returned into the house.

Lauren is being comforted by her mother Carole and another woman at the seven-bedroom property.It had been listed for rent recently and the description on a real estate website says it has four fireplaces, seven and a half bathrooms and a country eat-in kitchen.

Bridgehampton is in the millionaires playground of The Hamptons where the likes of Alec Baldwin, Paul McCartney and Billy Joel have properties.

The Silvermans have been married for 10 years and have a seven-year-old son called Adam.

Andrew Silverman graduated the 
University of Pennsylvania and began his career on the trading floor of 
Credit Lyonnais before becoming the chief investment officer at the 
family's firm, Andalex.

He met Silverman in his early 20s when she was a frequent presences in the city's social scene.

Since 2000, the couple have been 
living in a stunning apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a 'white glove condominium' aptly named The Savoy.

The

 condo was actually bought by Andrew’s father, Allen, for $1,213,500 in 
1999 and remains in his name. The property, will, of course, 
now be worth considerably more.

The
 building boasts a doorman, concierge, valet service, health club and a 
sundeck overlooking Manhattan – with superstore Bloomingdales just a 
block away.

But friends 
have said there were cracks behind the couple's perfectly manicured 
facade. They say that last year, the marriage was already on the rocks.

'Lauren
 and Andrew have been unhappy in their marriage for some time,' a source
 told Us Weekly. 'As their marriage deteriorated, she and Simon became 
close.'

But other friends 
said that Andrew was shocked by the revelations -
 and told the New York Post that he had even recently upgraded her engagement 
ring with a 10-karat diamond.

'It is 
an unbelievable story of betrayal,' Andrew's brother Alexander told the 
New York Post. 'It is a sad story and a tragic story.'

The
 divorce papers were filed on July 15 and Lauren is 10 weeks pregnant - 
making it clear she was expecting before he made a bid to end their 
marriage.

A close friend of Cowell told MailOnline today that Andrew Silverman had named him in the divorce 'to cause the utmost embarrassment' to the star.

The source said: 'This is just to exact revenge. Andrew wants to embarrass Simon. There's no way this will actually go to trial, but Andrew just wants to get back at him.'

Cowell, 53, and Lauren, 36, are believed to have met while on vacation in Barbados some years ago through Mr Silverman.

Biographer
 Tom Bower witnessed the beginnings of Cowell and Lauren's close 
friendship a year-and-a-half ago, when he spent time on a yacht called 
the Slipstream, which the mogul had chartered for  £2 million a month.

In
 his biography, Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell, Bower 
noted that there were a number of high-octane glamour women who were 
competing for Cowell’s attention, but that Lauren was ‘his closest 
confidante’.

Bower also 
details in the book Lauren's shock when Cowell initially told her about 
his engagement to Mezhgan Hussainy in February 2010.

According
 to Bower, Lauren, who he calls Cowell's 'best friend in New York' was 
'completely flabbergasted' by the news, telling Andrew as she finished 
her phone call with the mogul: 'The whole thing is wrong.'

The high-profile couple never 
made a secret of their friendship with Cowell and indeed when questions 
were constantly asked about the exact nature of Lauren’s friendship with
 the X Factor svengali, the reply would always be the same – an 
insistence that they were just close friends, and that Lauren was merely
 the wife of one of Cowell’s best friends.

Andrew now believes Lauren got close to Simon during one of the many vacations they all shared together, a friend has claimed.

While
 some sources say he and Lauren are a couple, others say he is preparing
 for a legal battle over his £225million fortune - a huge chunk of which
 could go on child maintenance.

But a friend of Lauren's told MailOnline: 'Lauren loves Simon, she says that she wants to marry him. And with the baby, she's going the right way about it! But I think this could be really good for Simon.'

Despite the uncertainties of the couple's future, on Wednesday night, Lauren's stepmother called the baby news a 'blessing'.

Rosy
 Davis, who is the wife of Mrs Silverman's father Steven, said: 'We are 
all excited for the baby. It's beautiful. We feel blessed. Any kid is a 
blessing.'
