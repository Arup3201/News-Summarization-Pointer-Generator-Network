When Army National Guard Sergeant Dale Dick was deployed to Afghanistan nine-months ago, he left behind a pregnant wife and a young daughter.

When he returned home earlier this month, he knew he'd finally get to see the new addition to his family: a son he'd never met.

Like many soldiers who return to the families they leave behind, Dick wanted to 'do something special' upon his return - because his family 'deserved it,' he says.

'Oh, say can you see...(that your husband is standing at center ice?!)'

So, Dick got in touch with the Chicago Blackhawks - who currently are playing the Boston Bruins in hockey's Stanley Cup Finals - and asked if they could help him surprise his wife and children.

'I told them where I was at - I was in Afghanistan for the last nine 
months - I hadn't seen my brand new boy,' he says. 'So they said they were gonna do
it for me.'

The surprise reunion the team helped provide - during game two of the Stanley Cup Finals last Saturday in Chicago, no less - was nothing short of amazing.

Not soon enough: Dick's daughter sprints into his arms after having not seen him in nine months

'We got a phone call two days ago saying we had tickets to the Blackhawk's game,' Dick's wife, Crystal, said - before finding out that her husband also would be at the game. 'So we drove two hours to be here.'

When the crowd was summoned for the singing of the National Anthem, Dick was standing at center ice - holding flowers for his wife.

'I've been gone the last couple of years on two different deployments 
in the last three [years],' he says. 'So I thought something special would be nice.'

Surprise! Dick's wife, Crystal, had no idea her husband would be at the hockey game to which she just 'happened' to be given tickets

'She deserves it' - Dick says he will be 'forever grateful' to the Chicago Blackhawks for helping him do something special for his family

The family's heartwarming reunion came - in a corridor at the arena - just moments after Jim Cornelison finished singing both the American and Canadian national anthems, at which point Dicks daughter sprinted into his arms and he got to old his young son for the first time ever.

'I'm forever grateful,' Dick says of the Blackhawks, who lost the game in overtime - but currently are tied at two games with the Bruins in the best-of-seven series.
