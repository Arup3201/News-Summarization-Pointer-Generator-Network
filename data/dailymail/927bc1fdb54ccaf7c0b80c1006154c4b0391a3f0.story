Author and Playwright Tom Sharpe. Picture shows Tom Sharpe sat in his garden in Bridport, Dorset in 1985. He has died aged 85

A sadistic, goggle-eyed policeman, a scrawny and aggressive nymphomaniac, a politician with an excruciating perversion, a busty lesbian, a mad, retired colonel and a mild- mannered academic whose world is spinning out of control.

This was the interchangeable cast of a string of racy comic bestsellers that saw Tom Sharpe hailed as the successor to Evelyn Waugh and P.G. Wodehouse.

Novels including Porterhouse Blue, Blott On The Landscape and Wilt were translated into rollicking TV and film adaptations.

They starred top actors from David Jason to Ian Richardson and David Suchet, and comedians Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith.

But the author, who died yesterday aged 85 at his home in Llafranc, northern Spain, insisted he wasn’t worthy to be ranked alongside the finest wits: ‘I’m not a great writer, for God’s sake. I’m just a fool.’

His novels were spattered with filthy language and even ruder sexual fantasies. The farcical plots and the bawdy humour were as English as seaside postcards or Carry On films.

But Sharpe added something extra — a savage element of satire that gave his novels an appeal to all classes of reader.

His books rarely varied in tone, but there was something for everyone.

In the Wilt books, Sharpe’s accident-prone alter-ego Henry Wilt, consumed by sexual frustration and prone to violent outbursts, was driven round the twist by the political correctness of the Seventies.

As head of the department of ‘Liberal Studies’, he was plagued by his  college’s demand for sexual equality in all his lessons, so that bricklaying had to be taught as a joint diploma with nursery childcare.

Despite this cynicism, and his exasperation with every type of  British institution, Sharpe was an idealist who loathed racism and refused to be brow-beaten by the authorities. He was especially suspicious of the Army and the other uniformed forces of law and order.

‘It is a vital civil act in any society to make fun of the police,’ he said. ‘When you can’t, you’ve already landed in a dictatorial state.’

Born in Holloway, London, in 1928, his political education began young. His father, who was nearly 60, was a Unitarian minister, a pacifist and a socialist who became a fervent convert to the Nazi movement.

‘I think he must have gone dotty,’ Sharpe later mused. ‘He thought Hitler was a nice bloke.’

By the time he was a schoolboy, evacuated to Ludlow, Shropshire, Sharpe was as pro-German as his father. His ambition was to become an Obergruppenfuhrer in the Waffen-SS.

But when the first footage from liberated concentration camps was shown in 1945, Sharpe was devastated.

He did his national service with the Royal Marines, and was badly  bullied: ‘I was the only public schoolboy among 50 men and they were just knocking the hell out of me. Probably a good thing. I was an extremely arrogant young man.’

After taking his degree in history at Cambridge, he emigrated to South Africa, where his mother had been born. In Johannesburg he was a failed accountant before joining the government’s Non-European Affairs Department, which ran the black townships.

His jobs including rent-collecting and visiting tuberculosis patients judged too ill for treatment.

The squalor and degradation appalled him — and the dignity of the people moved him deeply. One patient, a 15-year-old girl, stuck in his mind for the rest of his life. The hospital refused to treat her, but her family refused to give up and, by going without their own food, they gradually nursed her back to health.

Sharpe turned reporter and started photographing the townships, and wrote polemical plays. He married briefly, then divorced.

Though it was impossible to stage the plays under apartheid, one was produced in London: The South Africans.

It brought a swift response from the 
Pretoria police, who raided Sharpe’s flat, seized and burned 36,000 of 
his photos, and threw him into prison.

Deported to England, he worked as a teacher for ten years in  Cambridge before publishing his first novel, aged 43.

Ian Richardson played the Master. A 'Porterhouse blue' was the slang name for a stroke, brought on by over-indulgence in the college cellars

Riotous Assembly was a dark and brutal farce about apartheid, inspired by a story he’d heard of an 80-year-old woman living next door to a police station, who asked the chief inspector to stop torturing suspects during the afternoon as their screams disturbed her nap.Another South African satire followed.

Then came his most famous novel, Porterhouse Blue, an attack on the academic world.

It followed the struggles of a head porter, Skullion, to thwart proposed reforms at a fictional Cambridge college called Porterhouse with a long and noble tradition of drunkenness, gluttony and aristocratic vandalism.

A ‘Porterhouse blue’ was the slang name for a stroke, brought on by over-indulgence in the college cellars. Blott On The Landscape followed in 1975, a novel about a greedy landowner’s efforts to get a motorway built across his ancestral estates.

When the TV adaptation was screened a decade later, one scene provoked uproar. Audiences weren’t ready for the sight of a naked George Cole (beloved as Arthur Daley in Minder) being whipped by Julia McKenzie, dressed as a cat.

But readers couldn’t get enough of this winning mix of bawdiness and polemic. Throughout the Seventies, Sharpe produced a book a year. But after Wilt On High was published in 1984, he suffered a paralysing bout of writer’s block.

He had a heart attack live on Spanish TV and was rushed into an ambulance. He was ordered by his doctors to stop smoking and it was giving up cigars, he insisted, not his weakened health, that made  writing impossible.

He was said to be furious at the Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones film version of Wilt two years later. He said: 'I was so angry about that because it was so absolutely wrong'

A six-part TV adaptation in 1987 of Porterhouse Blue, with David Jason as Skullion, brought him new fans, but he was furious at the Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones film version of Wilt two years later. ‘I was so angry about that because it was so absolutely wrong,’ he fumed. It was too broad and had lost all of its subtlety.

When Sharpe and his second wife Nancy moved to Llafranc, close to Barcelona, in the late Nineties, his writer’s block slowly lifted — as did the ban on cigars. The couple had been married since 1969, and had three daughters.

He produced several more novels, but the world that had so enraged him, of sexual repression and barking-mad ex-military men, was gone. ‘It is so depressing,’ he said. ‘I can’t bear it. There is no such thing as the English gentleman any more. Money rules everything.’

But he had made his mark. In 16 riotous novels, lewd and boiling with anger, he captivated the imaginations of readers, making us roar with laughter, but more important, making us bellow with him at the injustice of it all.
