Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne looked to have scored the catch of the day as the smiling star netted two huge fish during an outing with a friend.

The troubled star, who was treated in hospital last month after he was found staggering in the street during an alcoholic relapse, looked in better health than a few weeks ago, and beamed as he reeled in the trout.

However, he did appear to be toasting his success on the water with a  lager, apparently sipping from a can of Stella Artois beer on the banks of the lake at the Rockbourne trout fishery near Fordingbridge, Hampshire.

Catch of the day: Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne netted two huge fish during an outing with a friend

Time for a drink: The star appeared to be toasting his success on the water with a lager, apparently sipping from a can of Stella Artois beer on the banks of the lake at the Rockbourne trout fishery

Day out: The troubled star, who was treated in hospital last month after he was found staggering in the street during an alcoholic relapse, looked in better health than a few weeks ago

Fellow fishermen said he had pulled the can from a blue bag bearing the slogan 'Keep Calm And Carry', but had just stuck to one beer, and appeared to be sober. 

The midfielder, whose career included stints at Tottenham Hotspur, Glasgow Rangers and Lazio, chatted with fellow anglers, and posed of for pictures with his haul, giving one of the trout a kiss.

'It was great to see him healthier and happier than recently. He was smiling and really seemed to be enjoying himself,' one fisherman told the Daily Mirror.

He added: 'I only ever saw him drinking from one can and he seemed happy and sober.' 

In August, Gascoigne was taken to hospital after he was pictured clutching a bottle of gin in the street near his rented apartment in Sandbanks, Poole.

He was also seen wandering the streets outside his expensive apartment block, holding a carrier bag full of cans of Stella Artois, and sitting with his head in his hands.

Neighbours called 999 for help after finding the midfielder slumped against a wall, and an ambulance arrived to take the former England star to hospital.

After pictures emerged showing Gascoigne looking much older than 47, looking gaunt with sunken eyes, QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who also lives Sandbanks, offered him the chance to work alongside him in football.

Can: Fellow fishermen said he had pulled the can from a blue bag bearing the slogan 'Keep Calm And Carry', but had just stuck to one beer, and appeared to be sober

He said: 'I saw him about a month ago and said "I'll pick you up in the mornings, Gazza, come training with me and do a bit of work with the kids". I’d love it if he could do that. It's an open invitation.

'He's a great lad and it's sad to see what’s happened to him and how he's looking at the moment.'

In a TV documentary shown last September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him.

He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, having found been unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky.

Afficionado: Gascoigne has long been known for his love of fishing

Since then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago.

Earlier this month, he was seen crashing a golf buggy into a ditch after losing control of the 15mpg vehicle at the Playgolf course in Bournemouth.

He was said to be dazed but unhurt after the incident.

Days later he was photographed cradling a chicken at a pub in Hampshire, and the next day apparently being turned away from an off-licence in Poole.

Treatment: For the past four years, Gascoigne, pictured with his fishing flies, has been living in Poole, where he is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation centre

For the past four years, Gascoigne has been living in Poole, where he is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation centre, but was reportedly due to be evicted from his penthouse flat earlier this month after a string of disturbances.

The director of the management company in charge of the flats has dismissed claims he is being forced to leave, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract.

On September 10, he was arrested for allegedly throwing a brick at a van outside his home in Sandbanks and questioned on suspicion of criminal damage. It is believed it followed an altercation with a photographer.

He was released on bail until October pending further enquiries 

In 2010, he called a radio station to inform them he was off to search for fugitive Raoul Moat while he was hiding from police officers, taking with him a fishing rod, lager and some chicken.

He later admitted he did not realise that the former bouncer had shot a police officer in the face and admitted he feels 'guilty' about the incident.

Moat died following a stand-off with police. Gascoigne said in a radio interview at the time: 'He is willing to give in now. I just want to give him some therapy and say "come on Moaty, it's Gazza."' 

He later told the Daily Express: 'I thought I could take him fishing because stuff like that has worked on me. But his situation was different from mine.' 

In a TV documentary shown last September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him.

He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, having been found unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky. 

Since then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago.

Last year his friends DJ Chris Evans and ex-England cricketer Ronnie Irani paid for Gascoigne to attend a rehab clinic in Arizona. 

Hunter Davies, who co-wrote the former star's 2004 autobiography, said: 'He doesn’t even like alcohol. He hates the taste of it.

'I’ve been with him when he’s poured it into flower pots, because he finds it so revolting. But then he will get depressed, and just want to get obliterated.'

Despite his demons, he is still remembered fondly by fans of the clubs he played for - including Newcastle United, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough - for his brilliance on the pitch.

He starred in midfield for Terry Venables' England side during Euro 96, where his virtuoso goal against Scotland was topped off with an equally memorable celebration.

Six years earlier he was seen crying on the pitch after being booked in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany. The booking making him unable to play in the final.
