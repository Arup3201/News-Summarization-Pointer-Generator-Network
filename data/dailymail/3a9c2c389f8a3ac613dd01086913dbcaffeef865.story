The Chinese authorities have banned the phrase 'big yellow duck' as an internet search item after a prankster substituted tanks for ducks in a doctored version of a world famous photograph taken during the Tiananmen massacre

China has begun an annual crackdown on efforts by families to commemorate the 
victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre, 24 years after the 
pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed by the People’s Liberation 
Army.

A number of internet search terms have been banned including 'tomorrow' "today", "tonight", "June 4" and other number combinations that might refer to what the Chinese call the June Fourth Incident .

Censored: The Chinese authorities have banned the phrase 'big yellow duck' as an internet search item after a prankster substituted tanks for ducks in this doctored version of a world famous photograph

Tank man: The world famous image of a protestors standing in front of oncoming Chinese tanks during the 1989 protests

Popular: The doctored photograph is a reference to the 54-foot yellow duck created by Florentijn Hofman, which floats in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour. This shows a copy of the duck in Tianjin, China 

As reported by International Business Times, 'Big yellow duck'  has also been censored as a search item. It comes after a user on Sina Weibo, a Chinese social network, posted a doctored version of the famous  Jeff Widener's  photograph of a protester confronting a line of tanks in the square.

The doctored photograph instead features four ducks in row instead of the tanks. it was a reference to the 54-foot yellow duck created by Florentijn Hofman, 
which floats in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour.

Families of the victims of the massacre have been barred from visiting their graves by more than a dozen Chinese police stationed outside the main 'Stone Gate' entrance to the Wanan graveyard where many of the victims are buried.

The exact number of victims of the massacre on June 3-4 and the political crackdown which followed soon after is unknown but it is believed to run well into the hundreds if not more.

Commemoration: Tens of thousands of people joined a candlelit vigil in Hong Kong to mark the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests today

Crowds: Demonstrators swarmed the city's Victoria Park in memory of the brutal crackdown carried out by the Chinese government

Freedom: The commemorations have only been allowed to take place in Hong Kong amidst heightened security in mainland China

Vibrant: Protesters brought a series of eye-catching banners aimed at undermining the government's anti-democratic policies

The Chinese Government considers the peaceful protest 
by students and workers to have been a 'counter-revolutionary' revolt, 
and has previously defended the decision to send in tanks and troops. 
It has never provided an official death toll.

The move by Beijing is 
part of a major push to suppress discussion of the massacre across China and Hong Kong, particularly online and around 
certain parts of the capital.

Security personnel were patrolling 
the narrow streets close to Beijing's Forbidden City and outside the former 
house of Zhao Ziyang, the Communist party secretary who was purged and 
held under house arrest following the protests.

Authorities have also detained or 
enhanced surveillance on 10 prominent dissidents, according to the Hong 
Kong-based advocacy group China Human Rights Defenders.

Passion: A man brandishes a candle as he protests next to a statue depicting the 'Goddess of Democracy' in Hong Kong

Moving: But in mainland China the authorities have blocked sensitive search terms to avoid controversy

Repression: Some protesters sat behind bars to symbolise the Chinese government's hardline authoritarian policies

Online 
searches for a range of keywords on Sina Weibo, China's version of 
Twitter, have been blocked, from ‘Tiananmen’ to ‘candle’, which has been used to 
encourage digital vigils.

Instead activists turned to overseas websites to commemorate the event and criticise authorities.

‘The
 dispute in this country is basically stuck on whether to light a candle
 or to extinguish it,’ dissident artist Ai Weiwei posted on Twitter.

Rights
 lawyer Liu Xiaoyuan said on Twitter that he had been blocked from Sina 
Weibo for seven days for sharing 'sensitive information' -- urging 
others to honour victims by posting an image of a lit candle.

Tributes: Wreaths left in Hong Kong to commemorate the iconic events of the 1989 protests

Security: There was a heavy police presence in Tiananmen Square itself to prevent the possibility of a memorial protest

A 
mocked-up picture was circulating online of the 1989 ‘Tank Man’ 
photograph of a civilian staring down a long row of tanks headed toward 
Tiananmen Square -- with the military vehicles replaced by plastic 
ducks.

The image could not be found on domestic websites within the 
‘Great Firewall of China’ as the country's system of internet controls 
is known.

The high-profile dissident Hu Jia wrote on Twitter the
 broad crackdown on discussion of Tiananmen demonstrated the 
government's weakness.

The event underscored the ruling Communist 
Party's ‘illegal nature’, he wrote. ‘The unprecedentedly high pressure 
for the 24th anniversary of June 4 actually reveals the authorities' 
fear.’

Contrast: Chinese tourists in the square seemed carefree today; many are unaware of what happened in 1989

Over the weekend China accused the US of 'prejudice' after it urged Beijing to provide a full account of the crackdown on activists after the Tiananmen Square protests.

Foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the US should 'stop interfering in China's internal affairs'.

The Chinese authorities had already reached a 'clear conclusion' about the Tiananmen Square protests, he added.

On Friday, the US state department said the 24th anniversary of the 'violent suppression of demonstrations in Tiananmen Square' prompted it to remember this 'tragic loss of innocent lives'.
