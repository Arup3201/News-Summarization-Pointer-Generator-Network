For the 29th time in over a year, British woman Lisa Gant donned a white wedding dress and walked down the aisle to marry her fiancé, Alex Pelling, this time on a historic plantation in South Carolina.

Last June, Gant, 30, and Pelling, 32, of Manchester, England, embarked on a mission to travel the world and tie the knot in every one of more than 50 locales they plan to visit as part of their extraordinary plan to raise money for UNICEF.

This Saturday, the traditional Southern wedding, complete with a horse-drawn carriage and a big poufy princess gown, took place on Litchfield Plantation in Myrtle Beach.

Addicted to wedded bliss: The two will exchange vows five times on their five-day visit to Myrtle Beach

International love: Gant and her fiance sold off all their possessions last year, quit their jobs in Manchester and set off on a worldwide tour to experience different cultures and get married in every place their visit 

Although the couple keep getting 
hitched, they are not legally married. They said their journey to wedded
bliss will end sometime in 2014 when they pick their favorite spot of 
all the places visited and make their union official, according to the Myrtle Beach Sun News.

The
Saturday ceremony was just the first wedding the lovebirds will have in
Myrtle Beach. The couple plan to stay in the area for five days, and 
each day the two will exchange vows.

Gant
and Pelling's over-the-top wedding plans attracted worldwide attention 
along with vendors eager to help the couple along on their journey in 
exchange for publicity.

As
the two hop from country to country and from continent to continent in
search of the perfect spot to officially say 'I do,' Gant and Pelling 
are spending no more than $60 a day in gas money to fuel up a 
quarter-century-old camper they affectionately call 'Peggy' in honor of 
the bride's 93-year-old grandmother.

To save money, Gant and Pelling avoid
hotels, shower every couple of days at camp sites and cook most of 
their meals themselves. 

Everywhere they go - whether it is 
Belize, Colombia, El Salvador or Hawaii - venues, dress makers, 
bakeries, DJs and florist are happy to donate their services in the 
hopes that the exposure will boost local tourism and attract more 
customers.

When in Rome...The couple make sure to always follow local customs and traditions, so for their Southern wedding, Gant donned a princess gown and accessorized it with a tall updo with a tiara

While in Myrtle 
Beach, Gant and Pelling are preparing to take their unusual love and 
marriage story national with an interview on ABC's 20/20.

The couple met more than a decade 
ago, but their romance got off to a rocky start because the two were in 
relationships with other people at the time. They parted ways, but 
reconnected three years later and have been inseparable ever since.

Last summer, the two decided to sell 
off all of their possessions, quit their jobs and travel the world to 
experience different cultures while celebrating their love with a 
wedding ceremony (or five) in each place they visit and raising money for UNICEF.

Pelling organized the first nuptials 
in Manchester as a surprise for his bride the day before they were to 
take off on their world-wide trip.

Kindness of strangers: Everywhere they go, vendors donate their services, from dresses to music, food and venues, in exchange for free publicity. Gant borrowed the dress for the Myrtle Beach nuptials, but her custom-made shoes are her own, right, courtesy of a friend from Australia

The South Carolina wedding blitz 
marks the couple's third stop in North America this year, with Canada 
and Colorado being the first two. Last year, the two got hitched in Las 
Vegas and celebrated a vampire-themed Halloween wedding in Hollywood.

Gant
and Pelling agree that of the 28 weddings they have had so far, the 
Peru nuptials top the list because of the symbolism associated with the 
traditional ritual.

'The ceremony involved scented oils, music playing, the smoke 
burning. It's very intense," Pelling told The Huffington Post. 'We think everyone should get
married there.'

When it comes to wedding planning in 
exotic and far-flung locales, Gant and Pelling make sure to embrace the 
local culture, whether it be wearing a skimpy woven top and loin cloth 
during wedding No 18 in a remote Panamanian village, or riding on a 
horse in blue jeans and cowboy hat in Canada’s Banff National Park.

Final destination: The Manchester couple plan to conclude their world wedding tour by officially becoming husband and wife sometime in 2014 in a yet-to-be-determined locale

In South Carolina on Saturday, that meant dressing in a large ball gown and black tuxedo, and marching down the aisle to the sounds of cello and violin as guests in blue jeans watched the couple in awe.

‘It could never be bad because we have no expectations,’ Pelling said.
