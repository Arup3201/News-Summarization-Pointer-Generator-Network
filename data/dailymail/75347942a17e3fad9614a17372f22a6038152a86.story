A maths graduate has been found guilty of murdering his father before dismembering him and placing his body parts in storage boxes which he used as a television stand.

Nathan Robinson used a Stanley knife, a hacksaw and a saw to cut up the body of his father, 48-year-old William Spiller, at the flat they shared in  Bournemouth, Dorset, in May 2013.

The court was told that the following day, Robinson travelled to Glasgow to visit friends and gave one of them a boxset of the Saw horror films.

A jury at Winchester Crown Court took just one and a half hours to find Robinson guilty of the murder of the 48-year-old taxi driver.

Robinson had denied the charge of murder but admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility.

He also took almost £8,000 of his father's cash after the murder and tried to clean up the scene with newly-purchased cleaning products. 

In the following month, he further covered his tracks by using his father's mobile phone, sending text messages to his partner, Glenys Molyneaux, and his friends.

When Robinson was arrested on June 18,  a day after Mrs Molyneux reported Mr Spiller missing, he asked police if it was a joke. 

The trial has heard that Robinson cut up his father's body and placed the parts in storage boxes with a television on top.

His head was placed in a box and put in a filing cabinet. Robinson tried to clean resulting mess with a specialist steam cleaner he purchased from Homebase, but a neighbour living in the flat below complained of a 'pink liquid' seeping through the ceiling.

Robinson told the court that he had only limited memories of the killing.

He claimed that he had been abused as a child by his father and by another man on a separate occasion. 

He also said his mother, Elaine Robinson, worked as a prostitute and he had found an advertisement which she used to offer her services.

The defendant told the court that he had completed a mathematics degree at Aberystwyth University but had failed to complete a masters degree in bio-fuels and managing the environment.

He explained that he completed the taught part of the second degree but did not finish the dissertation after he became 'distracted' at finding out about his mother's activities. 

However, Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, said the likely motive for the killing was financial as Robinson owed his father £36,000.

He also took almost £8,000 of Mr Spiller's cash, which he used after the killing to go partying with his friends in Scotland and to take his mother to a vegan weekend in Bristol. 

Robinson, wearing a grey suit, white shirt and tie, showed no emotion or reaction as the verdict was announced.

The judge, Mr Justice Griffith Williams, thanked the jury and said: 'There is only one sentence I can pass, which is life imprisonment, but I have to determine the minimum term he will serve before the parole board will consider his release.' 

Following the verdict, Desmond Duffy, Senior Crown Prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service in Wessex, said: 'Nathan Robinson savagely killed his father, William Spiller and then went to great lengths to hide his crime.

'It was the prosecution case that money may have been a motive for the crime. The 27-year-old, who lived with his father, accepted that his financial position was dire at the start of 2013.

'An I.O.U recovered from the flat which was dated June 2011 said: "I Nathan Robinson totally accept that I am indebted to my father to the sum of £36,000 (...)"

'The jury at Winchester Crown Court heard how the 27-year-old and his father had a history of disputes. 

'On May 16 2013, they had argument; the argument was so loud that it was heard by their downstairs neighbour, who heard the sounds of a struggle and then Mr Spiller asking his son to get him an ambulance.

'Robinson did not call an ambulance. He admitted stabbing his father to death and cutting his body into pieces and storing the body parts in plastic boxes. He also admitted taking his father's money before leaving the flat.

'It was the prosecution's case that the defendant at the time of the killing did not suffer from any abnormality of mental functioning that would have diminished his responsibility for his actions. 

'The jury heard that the way Mr Robinson acted after the killing could only show clarity of mind.

'Not only did he dismember his father's body, he paid the month's rent on the flat, purchased two Vax cleaners to remove blood stains from the floor and pretended his father was still alive by sending texts to one of his father's best friends and to his father's partner, Glenys Molyneaux, who became very worried and alerted the police.

'Robinson carried on his life as normal, supported by his father's money, by going to Scotland, meeting friends and organising a weekend in Bristol. When the police arrested him he asked them if it was a joke. 

'Our thoughts go out to Ms Molyneaux and the rest of Mr Spiller's family and friends.'

The case was adjourned for sentencing on a date to be fixed and Robinson was remanded in custody.
