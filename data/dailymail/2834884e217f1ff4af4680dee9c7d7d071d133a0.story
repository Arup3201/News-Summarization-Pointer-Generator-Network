A young mother has been arrested after her newborn son died with traces of methamphetamine in his blood stream. 

Tyelyn Sanders of Calhoun County, Alabama was picked up after an autopsy showed that her four-month-old son, who died in August 2014, had meth in his bloodstream - this after Sanders said she breastfed the boy, making it likely that she was using the drug around the time she was feeding her child.

What's more, when Sanders' two other children, ages 8 and 2, were tested for the drug, they both turned up positive.

Sanders responded to the charges by writing on Facebook; 'No matter what ppl say I know im a good person, mother, and I love my kids'

Alabama.com is reporting that those two have been removed from the home by the Department of Human Resources.

Sanders responded to the charges on Facebook last week, writing; 'No matter what tomorrow brings idc what anyone says about me. . No matter what!!! No matter what ppl say I know im a good person, mother, and I love my kids ALL of them til the death of me.'

She then added; 'i have made a few bad choices and even had a few bad habits.. but ive been done with all that sometimes the past comes to haunt u and u must face it.. anyone who knows me, loves me, and cares about me knows that and those are the ones that matter!!!!I have a strong support system and thank my closest friends and family for that.' 

When Sanders' two other children, ages 8 and 2, were tested for the drug, they both turned up positive

She closes by saying; 'This shall NOT break me Im a strong woman with a strong faith in GOD and I will keep my peace and faith and the Devil will not get to me!!'

Sanders had previously been very vocal on Facebook about getting back her son's autopsy report, and in one post attacked a woman charged with killing her child, writing; 'I would do anything to have my son back and there's ppl out here killing there babies! I hope who ever is responsible for killing this child gets what they deserve.'
