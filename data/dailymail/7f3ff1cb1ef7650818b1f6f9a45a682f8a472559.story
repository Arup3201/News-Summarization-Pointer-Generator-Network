Hardened swimmers up and down the country took to freezing cold waters this morning as the bizarre Christmas Day dip tradition continued to prevail.

Thousands of swimmers in fancy dress lined an overcast seafront in Exmouth, Devon, with brave participants launching themselves into the sea for the annual swim.

Among some of the unusual outfits on display were people dressed as Christmas puddings, Santa's elves and giant wrapped presents - with one man opting to go as Batman character Bane - played by Tom Hardy in The Dark Knight Rises.

The Exmouth Christmas day swim was born when local Ken Cunningham took a dip with pals Peter Horne, Stan Jordan, Nick Hockings, David Hart and Miss Ireland.

Nearly 50 years later, the original six swimmers has grown to thousands from across the globe - with many taking part in the challenge to raise money for charity.

Shortly after the White Christmas Dip took place members of the Bournemouth Spartans, the town's long-running winter swimming club, took to the water.

Peter Jenkins, 47, from Bournemouth, said: 'The water was freezing at first but after the initial shock it wasn't so bad. It certainly woke everyone up after their Christmas Eve indulgences.'

A group of brave swimmers also continued a 150-year tradition as they jumped into the sea at Brighton on a crisp Christmas morning.

Brighton and Hove City Council had decided it would close the beach today over 'safety fears' after a man got into difficulty in the waters earlier this year and another swimmer had to be rescued while taking part in the event three years ago.

Brighton Swimming Club agreed to follow the council's lead and cancel its annual festive swim after its dedicated group of 30 experienced swimmers taking part has swelled to 4,000 revellers turning up at the beach in fancy dress and after heavy drinking in recent years.

A spokesman for the council said: 'This year the council will be taking extra measures to discourage swimmers from taking a Christmas Day dip by closing the beaches around the Palace Pier.'

The council said it had decided to close the beach after fears over the safety of people getting into the water on Christmas Day.

Swimmers and spectators donned fancy dress to raise money for local charities. This year swimmers were asked to follow the theme of clowns and Vikings in memory of two of the event's mainstays for many years.

And in London's Hyde Park, groups of brave swimmers gathered for the Peter Pan Cup race, held every Christmas Day by members of the Serpentine Swimming Club at the Serpentine.
