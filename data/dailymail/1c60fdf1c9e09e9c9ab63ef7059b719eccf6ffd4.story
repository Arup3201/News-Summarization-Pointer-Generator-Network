A $67 invention that uses packets of empty chips to purify contaminated water could be Australia's answer to saving millions of lives.

Dubbed the Solar Disinfection, four budding university engineers have formulated a design that uses the sun and packets of chips to kill harmful pathogens living inside contaminated water.

The sun bounces off the reflective layer inside the chip packets and heats the water inside a glass tube - disinfecting  contaminants such as faecal matter which may be present.

The reflective layers from chip packets line inner sides of the timber and reflect the suns rays onto the glass, killing-off the water pathogens inside

The product, which cost just $67, is a fraction of the cost of a top of the line design and just as effective

Although in its early stages, University of Adelaide  engineers Harrison Evans, Anthony Liew, Mark Padovan and Michael Watchman hope the product will provide a welcome relief to some of the 780 million people living with limited access to fresh water.

Adelaide researcher Dr Chris Birzer, who oversaw the design, said contaminated water kills about 2.5 million people a year through dehydration caused by diarrhoea.

He said the Solar Disinfection - which is built using half a cylinder of reflective material and a meter-and-a-half length of glass tube - could help counteract illness by better purifying water from the source to people's mouths.

The university has teamed up with Non Government Organisations working in Papua New Guinea to implement a trial of the design.

Dr Birzer said he hopes it will help to reverse the affects of water-borne illnesses in PNG, which claim the lives of 900 children annually.

'During the wet season in PNG the water comes from the roofs of houses which is littered with faecal matter from birds presenting a real problem,' he said.

And during the dry season the same faecal matter is collected in rivers and floats down stream, contaminating fresh water.

The four students behind the design the Solar Disinfection with Chip Packets are Harrison Evans, Michael Watchman, Mark Padovan and Anthony Liew

He said western civilisation's bid to reverse water-borne deaths in places such as Africa has been fruitless and more needs to be done.

'Western countries have invested over $1 billion in water treatment in Africa which has failed,' he said.

'So we need to work with NGO's and locals to help countries to rectify these issues.'

The revolutionary, yet extremely cheap design, uses the highly reflective layer inside a chip packet and the sun's heat to actively kill contaminants inside the water.

The prototype can be attached to a larger water system which connects the water from the source to the home.

Chips are a universal product which can easily be recycled in even the poorest of countries

The students trialled the product by hooking it up to a water system and testing the results at the other end

In testing the product the students found that the quality of the reflectivity is only a 'couple percent worse than the best product.'

Dr Birzer said the best manufactured prototype in the workshop cost about $4,500 - a fraction of the $67 price tag for the Solar Disinfection invention which was mostly spent on timber.

Already the idea is being rolled-out in PNG with the help of NGO, ChildFund.

Dr Birzer said the plan is to work with NGO's to create a solution to help communities reverse their poor living conditions on the ground. 

The purification project is now getting international interest, from places such as Brazil, Philippines and Thailand, Dr Birzer said.
