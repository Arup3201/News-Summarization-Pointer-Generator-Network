Demanding? Matt Lauer, pictured yesterday on the Today show, is said to be an 'anchor animal' by NBC sources

The Today show has been floundering in ratings, and sources say they know why.

Insider NBC sources told the New York Post’s Page Six that Matt Lauer, who has been co-anchor of the morning show since 1997, has become an ‘anchor animal.’

They said that he’s even gone so far as to forbid the name of opposing Good Morning America from being mentioned.

Sources told Page Six that Lauer is now ‘running the show and he’s not listening to anyone,’ causing a ‘huge problem.’

Viewership has been slipping away from the Today show as rival GMA has been gaining ground, winning the ratings war for the past two weeks. Early data shows that the ABC News morning show will most likely win for a third week, as well.

Another source lamented that the staff is overworked in an effort to catch up to GMA’s ratings.

‘Matt’s telling the staff they don’t work hard enough, which is hard to take from a guy working four days a week, making millions,’ the source told Page Six.

According to the gossip column, there are talks about Morning Joe co-host Willie Geist to join the flailing show, months after former co-host Ann Curry was let go.

End: The former anchor on the network¿s morning show was forced out in July having reportedly been told she was to blame for the slump

Trade Off: She was replaced by Savannah Guthrie, 40, pictured, amid reports her relationship with anchor Matt Lauer had turned sour

Responding to Page Six’s request for 
comment, Lauer said: ‘Please print this story – it’s the most 
interesting and dangerous I’ve ever sounded!’

NBC News did not immediately return MailOnline's request for comment.

Additionally, in the 10 weeks before 
Curry quit, Today got 4.94 million viewers, but in the 10 weeks since 
she left there were just 4.6million.

The figures will be especially depressing for NBC as they include its coverage of the London Olympics. The
network had hoped the $2.3billion that it paid for the exclusive rights
to screen The Games would give it a huge ratings boost.

Curry’s
departure from her ‘dream job’ after just year in the role was tearful 
and on camera she told viewers that she had tried her best, even though 
she apparently failed.

She was replaced by Savannah Guthrie, 40, amid reports her relationship with anchor Matt Lauer had turned sour.

Now however Curry has had her ‘revenge’ and the decision to fire her seems to have backfired.

Today’s
bitter rival, ABC’s ‘Good Morning America’ is on set to win its third 
consecutive week in a row, suggesting it could start to pull ahead soon.

GMA took the No.1 spot from Today for the first time earlier this year, ending its 16-year run as the most-watched morning show.

The viewing figures also show that there has been a shift away from Today among the key 25-54 audience.

In the 10 weeks before Curry left it was 2.1million but in the 10 weeks after it was just 1.9million.

Brad Adgate, Horizon Media’s senior vice president of research, told the New York Post: ‘The ratings point out the momentum GMA has been building.

In talks? There have been discussions for Morning Joe's Willie Geist to join Today, according to Page Six

‘Viewers like what they’re doing - it’s all so personality-driven, and that’s a recipe for success.

‘Even though NBC had the Olympics, ratings have fallen back to pre-Olympic levels.’

In an interview with Ladies’ Home Journal the 55-year-old claimed she was let go because of her bad dress sense.

She also revealed that she did not like to wear high heels even though her bosses asked her to and that her gray hair became an issue.

Curry said that at one point a colleague even compared her to Froot Loops mascot Toucan Sam because of her multicolored dress.

The reason for the bitter rivalry between NBC and ABC is simple - money and prestige.

In 2011 Today earned $500m from adverts, helped significantly by the fact it was no.1 in the ratings.

GMA by contrast managed $310m.

A 30-second advert on Today sells for $52,000 versus $35,000 for GMA, according to analysts Kantar Media.
