Desmond Hughes, 65, and his partner have been found guilty of harassment after putting up security cameras around their house

A former House of Lords special adviser is today  facing jail after he was found guilty of using security cameras to spy on the teenage daughter of his next door neighbours during a campaign of harassment.

Political aide Desmond Hughes, 65, and his partner harassed their neighbours by rigging up cameras to watch their house.

Cardiff Magistrates' Court heard Hughes also stared at their daughter Talia Hancock, 18, through her bedroom window.

A judge said the conduct of Hughes and his partner Clare Anderson, 55, was 'unacceptable and oppressive'.

District Judge Bodfan Jenkins told Hughes and Anderson he was satisfied they were lying in evidence.

And he warned the pair that he was considering all options including prison.

The offence carries a maximum three month sentence.

Hughes had claimed in court that the cameras were part of security advice from the security industry and senior officers from ex-forces.

But Judge Jenkins told them: 'You continued pointing the cameras which had nothing to do with security or tackling crime.

'This was a deliberate course of conduct designed to create unpleasantness and to harass and distress.

'I am satisfied you are lying and that the Hancocks are telling the truth.'

The judge described Hughes as a 'deeply unimpressive witness'.

Hughes and Anderson were found guilty of harassing neighbours Nick and Linda Hancock and daughter Talia.

The court heard the harassment began a year after the Hancocks moved next door to Hughes in the upmarket Cardiff suburb of Old St Mellons.

College student Talia told Cardiff magistrates court that surveillance cameras were aimed on to their back garden and pointed directly at their drive.

Miss Hancock said: 'It was directly angled. It wasn’t pointed on to his property - just ours.

'I’m certain it was pointing directly on to our garden.'

And she told how Hughes and his partner constantly stared at her through her bedroom window.

Miss Hancock said: 'They would always look up at my window. I was always aware of that from the moment I moved in.

'They would stand there with their hands on their hips staring up at my bedroom until I moved away from my window.

'I thought it was odd behaviour to stand and stare up at somebody.

'My mum would always tell me to ignore them but it got to the point where I felt really intimidated by them.

'Whenever I’m in my bedroom now, my curtains are always drawn.'

Pc Christopher Fennessy told the 
hearing that police found a number of cameras on Hughes’ property but 
there was no evidence that images were being recorded.

Hughes admitted owning an extensive 
collection of firearms, shotguns and various explosives which were 
regularly inspected by police.

He admitted he had three cameras attached to both the front and back of his house when the Hancocks moved in next door.

But he claimed he never had cause to 
point the cameras in the direction of either their garden or driveway 
and most of them were not even working.

Hughes, a former special advisor to 
Labour’s Lord Robin Corbett, Baron Corbett of Castle Vale, will be 
sentenced later along with his partner Anderson.

The pair, who denied a joint charge of harassment, were ordered not to contact the Hancock family.

Linda Hancock said after the case: 'I’m pleased at the verdict but I don’t really want to say anymore.'
