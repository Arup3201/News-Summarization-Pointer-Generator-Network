The man suspected of shooting his daughter in the head before turning the gun on himself was 'not supposed to know where she and her mother lived', a neighbour said today.

Residents in the quiet village of Northiam, East Sussex, said the gunman was involved in a custody dispute over the seven-year-old girl, named locally as Mary Ann, and that the father was thought not to know their address.

But one neighbour who heard the gunshots yesterday afternoon said she had seen the gunman's silver Toyota Rav 4 driving around the village - home to Mary Ann and her mother, Lyndsey since last April - for the past week.

The little girl, a pupil at Beckley Church of England Primary School, was today 'gravely, gravely ill' in Kings College Hospital, London, her mother at her bedside, as police confirmed they believed the shooting to have been a domestic incident.

Villagers spoke of their shock at the horror in what is a leafy, quiet village near the border with Kent

This morning a police spokesman said the girl's condition was life-threatening and added 'We probably need to prepare ourselves for bad news'. 

Neighbours told how they heard the girl’s mother – who is separated from the father – scream 'He’s got a gun' before two shots rang out.

Her father, who locals said fired at his daughter from inside his car, was pronounced dead at the scene in the village, with a single gunshot wound to the head. 

One said: ‘Apparently he was not supposed to know where Lyndsey and her daughter moved to.'

Another said: 'They have only been in the village for a year and I’ve never seen a father around.  I’ve heard there may have been an ongoing custody dispute.'

Neighbour Helen Barber, 38, who has lived in the road for six years, said: 'A neighbour phoned and said a little girl had been shot.

'I ran out up to the house where it happened and went in. Mary Ann was on the sofa. There was blood everywhere.

'I couldn't feel a pulse.'I've done first aid before and she was showing no signs of life. Lyndsey, her mum, was hysterical.'

Locals said the little girl and her mother had moved to the quiet village of Northiam, near Rye, last April

Mrs Barber said the girl's mother has another child, a 21-year-old son who suffers from autism, and who was with a carer at the time of the shooting.

Mrs Barber's husband, Stuart, 46, said he heard the gunshots but assumed it was someone shooting pheasants until he looked out of the window and saw a large silver Toyota with blacked out windows.

He said: 'The car stopped.  There were two shots.  No-one went to the car.

'Within minutes armed police turned up and surrounded the car.'

He added: 'The bomb squad were here last night as there were rumours he was in some sort of cult and wanted to take Mary Ann away.  I don't know his nationality.'

Mrs Barber added: 'We have seen that car driving around for about a week.  You notice it. 

'Maybe he was looking for her?' 

Other residents described the little girl as 'absolutely beautiful' and 'incredibly charming'.

Cheryl Spicer, who lives nearby, said her partner was at their home when he heard screams of 'He’s got a gun'.

A police spokesman said: 'At this stage we are not in a position to confirm the relationships of all those involved but we can say that the girl and the man knew each other'

One villager said he had heard the man had gone to his former partner's home and shot the youngster

She said the girl, a pupil at Beckley Church of England Primary School, walked to school with her mother every day and that the pair had only lived in the neighbourhood for just over a year.

She added: 'This sort of thing just does not happen around here. 

'We can’t quite believe it.’

Anthony Burr, 37, who runs a public relations agency, said panic swept the neighbourhood when people realised somebody had shot a young girl. He added: ‘I was in the garden when I heard the shots and shortly after, my friend came over and told me that my children were locked in his house.

‘We thought at that point that a gunman was on the loose, so you can imagine the panic that swept the neighbourhood. Then I started to get reports that he had shot himself.

‘What appears to have transpired is that a father has gone to his ex’s house where his daughter lives and has shot her.'

Today Cathy Cremin, headteacher at Beckley Church of England Primary School, said: 'We have received confirmation that the child who was shot is a pupil at our school.

'This is dreadfully sad and shocking and the whole school community will now be praying for Mary and her family.' 

Fear: A man who lives close to where the incident took place said the village was 'on lockdown'

Writing on Twitter, Izzy Simmons said: '12 police cars, two undercover cars and two ambulances, just hope the little girl or her mum whoever has been shot is okay. The whole village has gone grey.'

Another resident said his mother ran to the scene and lifted the girl into her house, laying her on the sofa before phoning 999.

The girl was taken by helicopter to King’s College Hospital in London, where her mother is believed to be at her bedside.

This morning a police cordon remained in place as neighbours spoke of their shock at the shooting in their quiet, close-knit community.

Retired Eurotunnel worker Fred Lawrence, 75, said the girl, who he described as a 'lovely' youngster, would often stop to pet his cat.

He said: 'I last saw the girl this week as she was going to school. She was always with her mum. Her mum was very timid, but a lovely lady and she would always talk.

“The girl was obsessed by my cat and she would make a fuss before going on her merry way to school. I’m a bit upset talking about this.

'I just feel shocked. It’s bloody sad. A man, whether it was her father, he must have been in a hell of a state to do that.' 

Neighbours said the police took at least 15 minutes to get to the scene as it is ‘in the middle of nowhere’.

Peaceful village: Cavix Field in Northiam, close to the scene of  yesterday's shooting 

The upmarket village lies in a peaceful rural area 12 miles from Hastings on England’s south coast.

A Sussex Police spokesman said: ‘One person suffered a gunshot wound and was taken to hospital for treatment.

‘The body of a man was found at the scene in Northiam.

‘His death is not being treated as suspicious.’ 

A man who lives close to where the incident, which took place between 6pm and 8pm, said the village was 'on lockdown' and armed police were 'everywhere'. 

The force said a suspect had been identified and 'is contained', and officers were not looking for anyone else 

He added: 'There was a stand-off, the whole village was terrified. He then shot himself and we think he's dead.

'Both [the man and his daughter] have been taken away.

'This is leafy, rural Sussex - it's a nice area. Paul McCartney lives in the next village. This is not the kind of thing that goes on here.'

Dru Riches-Magnier tweeted: 'I've heard several rumours and was walking my dog when people said they heard a shot near Cavix Field...doors locked.' 

Twitter user Izzy Simmons wrote that there were 12 police cars, two undercover cars and two ambulances at the scene.

She added: 'Cannot believe this is all happening in Northiam AND in my old house!

'The whole village has gone grey. Everyone's talking and everyone's praying... poor family.'
