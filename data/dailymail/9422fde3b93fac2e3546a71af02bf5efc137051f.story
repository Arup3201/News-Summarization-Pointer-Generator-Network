Alec Munday was alleged to have used inappropriate sexual language and had inappropriate conversations with pupils while working as a teacher in north Wales

A teacher accused of singing Let's Talk About Sex to a 12-year-old girl and pretending to have been in a relationship with Cheryl Cole has been banned from the classroom.

Former Army radar technician Alec Munday was also alleged to have used inappropriate sexual language, causing distress to a child, and had inappropriate conversations with pupils while working as a teacher in north Wales.

The General Teaching Council for Wales heard Mr Munday was said to have sung from Jessie J’s hit Domino while supervising a lunchtime ICT session. He said he only knew the line 'take me down like (I’m) a domino.'

Presenting officer Lousha Bryl told the professional conduct committee: 'The lyrics contain sexual language and the song is about a sexual encounter. There was a mixed range of ages that attended this lunchtime club.'

Mr Munday, 47, faced four allegations, all found to be proved, and the committee said they amounted to unacceptable professional conduct.

Imposing a prohibition order, committee chairman Steve Powell said Mr Munday had expressed genuine regret and apologised.

He said: 'Although his actions were inappropriate there was no sexual or ulterior motive.'

In May 2012 the temporary teacher at a school in Llangefni, Anglesey, was alleged to have used inappropriate sexual language causing distress to a girl, and to have sung an inappropriate song containing sexual language in the presence of pupils.  

Married Mr Munday told the GTCW at Ewloe he was listening to the radio and singing along to tunes at Ysgol Gyfun, Llangefni.

He said he sang lyrics from the Jessie J hit Domino during a lunchtime ICT session but only knew the line 'Take me down like (I’m) a domino'.

He said: 'I didn’t sing the whole song. I only knew the closing line of the chorus.

'I wouldn’t consider it to be inappropriate, just a pop song.'

While a supply teacher at Darland High School (pictured), in January 2012, Mr Munday had also allegedly remarked 'oh that's beautiful' and 'don't stop' while a girl was drawing a camel

He said it was during his lunch break.

He said: 'I wasn’t in a formal teaching mode. I didn’t say "come into my class and listen to my singing".' 

Mr Munday accepted singing Carly Rae Jepsen’s hit Call Me Maybe but disputed singing Let’s Talk About Sex by Salt-n-Pepa and could not remember if he sang Hit Me Baby One More Time by Britney Spears.

He said: 'It was whatever came on the radio basically.'

Miss Bryl said 'Pupil A', 12, felt the words of the Salt-n-Pepa song Let's Talk About Sex were directed at her.

But Mr Munday said what happened had been misinterpreted and came about because of another girl’s 'email signature' which stated: 'I want your body.'

The teacher had told this pupil she could not put that and in a raised voice said: 'It's like me ending emails with "yours sincerely Mr Munday, I want to have sex with you".'

Representing himself, Mr Munday said to the GTCW panel: 'I felt I needed to make a shocking response. I used a shocking analogy.'

Mr Munday said he was not 'trying to be sexual' when he made the remarks about the drawing at Darland High School

Mr Powell said: 'Mr Munday said he used the language he did to shock the pupil to make her appreciate the inappropriateness of the words. He acknowledges his words may have been overheard by a pupil and, if misinterpreted, may have caused her distress.

'We are satisfied Mr Munday's language was inappropriate and unprofessional even though we accept his intention wasn't to cause distress.'

Deputy headmaster Alwyn Pritchard said Pupil A’s mother rang and said her daughter had returned home upset by what the teacher allegedly said to her. Mr Munday resigned a few days later.

The previous January, while a supply teacher at Darland High School, Rossett, Wrexham, Mr Munday was accused of inappropriate conversations with pupils.

Two Year 10  'model pupils', had claimed he discussed his first sexual encounter and sang I'm Sexy And I Know. He was also said to have talked about X Factor judge Cheryl Cole.

Head Peter Agnew said: 'They both knew what Alec Munday had said was wrong.'

He had also allegedly praised a girl’s drawing of a camel by stating 'oh that's beautiful' and 'don't stop'.

Pupils took it as sexual innuendo and burst into laughter.

Mr Munday said: 'I heard the laughter and realised it was about what I said.

'I wasn’t trying to be sexual, I was trying to talk about the drawing. It all came out wrong.'

Mr Munday told the committee that two girls had asked him about the X Factor judge and he was at first 'taken aback'.

He said: 'I remembered I must have been to this school and mentioned I previously knew a girl called Cheryl Tweedy who had gone off to be a singer and what happened to her, which was greeted with laughter at the time. The two girls wanted to know more details.'

He denied saying he had been in a sexual relationship with her.

Mr Munday told the committee: 'I wish to express my regret these incidents occurred.'

He added: 'I left teaching because it was far too stressful in the supply role, for the state of my mental health.

'I have no intention of returning to teaching.

Miss Bryl said he qualified in 2010 after a post-graduate course at Bangor University. She suggested he had 'an inability to learn from his mistakes'.

Mr Powell said without retraining 'there would be a significant risk of repetition of the behaviours'.

The fourth allegation was that he 'lost it' when he grabbed a child by the wrist and removed her from his class while a supply teacher at Wood Memorial primary school at Saltney, near Chester, in March 2011.

Headmistress Ceri Williams said: 'The class was quite a challenging year four class.'

Teaching assistant Cheryl Evans said: 'I thought his actions were inappropriate. The force used was definitely excessive.'

Mr Munday said a disruptive girl had refused to leave the class and he 'assisted her to her feet' and escorted her across the room. 'I felt I had no choice at the time.' He accepted this amounted to unacceptable professional conduct.
