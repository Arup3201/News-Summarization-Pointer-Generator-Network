A school assistant who barricaded young children inside a classroom before stripping naked and fighting with staff did it because she thought Satan was outside, her lawyers said today.

Linda Lira, 31, is facing four years in jail after she was arrested at Lemon Grove Academy in San Diego yesterday for locking a group of nine to 11-year-olds into a classroom.

Police initially thought Lira, who is from San Diego, had taken hallucinogenic drugs, but tests came back negative and her lawyers now say she was trying to protect the children from demons.

Linda Lira, 31, was arrested yesterday after locking a group of nine to 11-year-olds into a classroom, then fighting with school staff as they tried to free the youngsters, while 'undressing and dressing repeatedly'

Police initially thought Lira, who is facing four years behind bars, had taken drugs, but test came back negative and her lawyers now say she locked the room because she thought demons were outside

The strange incident began in a classroom at Lemon Grove yesterday at around 4pm when Lira began 'acting bizarre' before locking herself and a group of students inside a room.

One child was slapped an two others pushed to the floor when they tried to escape, suffering minor injuries, as Lira began barricading the door.

The quick-thinking youngsters used Lira's unguarded campus radio to call for help, and when other staff arrived and broke into the room, Lira began fighting with them.

The children managed to slip out of the room, leaving Lira behind, at which point she began 'undressing and dressing repeatedly', according to one Sheriff's Deputy.

She was initially arrested for 14 counts each of child endangerment and false imprisonment, but this was later revised to three charges of false imprisonment and one of resisting arrest.

The incident happened yesterday at Lemon Grove Academy (pictured). Lawyers say they are still trying to piece together exactly what happened, but think the breakdown was triggered by something in Lira's past

Today defense attorney Corey Wlodarczyk said Lira had suffered a 'breakdown' inside the classroom, telling NBC 7 that she 'suffers from emotional issues'.

While Mr Wlodarczyk said he is still trying to piece together exactly what happened, he said the behavior was 'uncharacteristic' of Lira, and was likely triggered by something in her past.

He added that Lira was scared, having never been arrested before, and said she was taking her ordeal 'one day at a time'.

The suspect’s sister, Cathy Lira, said her sibling had been making some strange comments about Lucifer and warriors guarding her in recent weeks, but declined to say more.

Lira was initially being held on bail of $2.1million, but that has now been cut to $500,000 after prosecutors dropped charges.
