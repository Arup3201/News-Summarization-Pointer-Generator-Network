She may have shot to fame as the UK's most famous glamour model with a penchant for fake tan, peroxide hair extensions and heavy eye make-up, but Katie Price wants the world to know that she's left those days long behind her.

The 36-year-old maintains that she's so disinterested in beautifying herself - apart from for public appearances, as these photos attest - that the only thing in her make-up bag is a tub of Vaseline.

Speaking to MailOnline, the model and entrepreneur, who has just been unveiled as the new face of hair dye removal product ColourB4, said: 'The older you get, the less interested in make-up you are. A smokey eye is ageing and with four kids, the last thing on my mind is make-up.

'In fact, I don't wear any. Vaseline is the only thing in my make-up bag to keep my lips moisturised.'

Bare-faced beauty: Katie Price, who opted for a more muted colour palette at today's photoshoot, opened her make-up bag for FEMAIL - but it's pretty minimal!

The mother-of-four did, however, admit that she swears by four beauty treatments that she's been having since her final years of school.

'I have my eyelashes and eyebrows tinted every week. I think good brows are really important and I love having a matching manicure and pedicure. I've had the same girl doing it for six years,' she aid.

And it isn't just her beauty regime that Katie couldn't care less about. Describing her personal style, she said: 'Well, let's just say I've never been voted best-dressed and I'm always in the worst dressed category but I don't care.

'I've got better things in my life than to worry about what I'm wearing. I prefer being comfortable and I know I can dress up when I want to,' she said.

While she isn't too fussed about lip gloss or bronzer, Katie makes sure she takes care of her hair, hence signing up with ColourB4, a natural colour remover that claims to work by reversing the colouring process, shrinking the colour molecules along with any toxins trapped inside the hair.

Speaking about her new project, she said: 'I've gone from dark to blonde back to brown so all the dye has taken its toll on my hair.

'Plus, I went to a hairdresser in the U.S. years ago and he burned my hair off because he put too much peroxide in it and it's been so hard to grow back so never go to the hairdressers, do it at home.

‘I now use ColourB4 every time I colour my hair, in just one hour it safely transforms my hair leaving it in the best condition and ready for me to experiment with my next look.'

And Katie, who cites Amanda Holden as her hair icon, is already planning her new look - and she's feeling daring.

'I am definitely going to change my hair and do something really different and crazy for a change. I might dye it green for a week because my son Harvey likes the colour,' she revealed.

Shunning style: Busy mother-of-four Katie says she's got better things to worry about than how she looks when she leaves home

Katie, who is currently pregnant, has 
had a tough time of it recently after discovering that her estranged
 husband Kieran Hayler was having an affair with her best friend
 of 20-years, Jane Pountney.

However, the future is looking bright for the nation's favourite former glamour girl, who already has a lucrative book deal, perfume, lingerie line, haircare range and equestrian collection under her blingy belt.

She said: 'I have lots of exciting plans and I am going to focus on being a businesswoman. I've written the next four chapters of my autobiography this week and I've got a product coming out in July.

'I can't wait, it's very exciting. Let's just say it's more of a thrill and the word "gushing" comes to mind...'
