Sam Allardyce has revealed he told his side to target Eliaquim Mangala as the weak link in Manchester City’s defence and blamed Manuel Pellegrini for leaving him exposed.

In West Ham’s shock victory against City, the £32million summer signing from Porto had a torrid afternoon and could not cope with the powerful forward line of Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia.

But West Ham manager Allardyce criticised City and Pellegrini for the way they have heaped pressure on Mangala as he learns to adapt to life in the Barclays Premier League.

Allardyce said: ‘I think they leave him exposed. He’s only just joined. They don’t protect him and he’s only just got here. Vincent Kompany is used to it, he’s been at this level for such a long time. This lad’s not, he’s finding his feet and we made big strides down the left and caused them lots of problems.’

In only the ninth minute, Mangala  sent a clearance looping over Joe Hart which was dropping in until the keeper leapt back to push it over.

Twice he was beaten to headers by Sakho from long balls played in from free kicks. From one of them, Valencia raced on to the ball and was only denied by Hart rushing from goal.

On two occasions he allowed Sakho to steal the ball, putting his side under pressure. Pellegrini offered no defence of his player in the wake of the defeat, but pointed to the defending of the whole team.

But Allardyce was insistent that Mangala should have been looked after better. He added: ‘Maybe there should have been a bit more protection from other players. That wasn’t there and we exposed that.’

City have conceded 17 goals in all competitions this season after 14 games — two more than at the same stage last season. They have also kept only one clean sheet in the league. Their title rivals Chelsea, meanwhile, have five.
