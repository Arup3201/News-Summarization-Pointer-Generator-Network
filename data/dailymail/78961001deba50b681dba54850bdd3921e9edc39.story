A 90-year-old World War II veteran from Ohio delighted his family members on Thursday when he decided to go sledding on a snowy hill while being dragged by a roaring ATV.

GoPro footage of Claude Bratcher making his way down a snowy hill with his trusty dog Smitty by his side was posted to YouTube on Friday and is already racking up thousands of views.

WBIR reports that Bratcher was sledding with his great-grandkids, ages five through 17 on Thursday. 

Off they go!: Claude Bratcher, 90, and his dog Smitty go sliding down a snowy hill to the delight of Bratcher's family who decided to film his playful journey

Go grandpro!: Bratcher's family used GoPro technology to film him on the sled pulled by an ATV 

The youngsters were joined by Bratcher, the biggest kid of all, as they took turns taking a sled ride pulled by an ATV.

'They were all out sledding,' Bratcher's son said on Friday night.

'I told Dad, "You want to ride over and watch them?" and he said, "Yeah, let's go." So I put him in the truck and we rode over, and he sat there awhile and said, 'I believe I'll try it, too."'

Bratcher's grandson-in-law Anthony Smith along with the rest of the family whipped out their cameras to capture him in action.

Then and now: Bratcher fought in World War II as a member of the 122nd US Naval Construction Battalion and he's still going strong

'It really moves me to think about how people are saying, you know, "Go for it! He's 90 years old" And they're all upbeat about it, you know,' Smith said.

'I hope I'm that way when I'm his age,' he added.

'Well, you can't sit down and do nothing. You have to stay busy," Bratcher said. "If you sit down and do nothing, you're in trouble.'

Bratcher  is very able bodied and continues to do work on his family's farm.
