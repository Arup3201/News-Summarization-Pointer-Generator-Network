A man who has been arrested on suspicion of killing two young brothers and one sibling's fiancee has a previous criminal record.

The San Diego Union-Tribune reported Sunday that 29-year-old Carlo Gallopa Mercado was arrested on gun charges in April but later released.

Mercado was arrested late Friday in Mira Mesa and booked on suspicion of killing Salvadore Belvedere and Ilona Flint, both 22, in the early hours of Christmas Eve last year outside Westfield Mission Valley mall in San Diego.

Belvedere's 24-year-old brother, Gianni, was found dead in a car trunk about 3 ½ weeks later and some 90 miles north in Riverside.

Victims: Gianni Belvedere, 24, Ilona Flint, 22, and Salvatore Belvedere, 22, were murdered in California last year. An arrest has now been made in connection to the triple homicide

Dead: Gianni Belvedere's body (left) was foun in the trunk of his car. He had not been seen since the  murder of his fiancee, Ilona Flint (center) and his 
younger brother, Salvatore Belvedere. They were found shot dead in a San
 Diego mall parking lot on Christmas Eve 2013

Police have scheduled a Monday news conference to discuss the arrest.

Gallopa Mercado is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday.

The connection between Mercado and the triple homicide is not yet known.

At the time of the murders, San Diego police were baffled by the crime, having no motive and no suspects.

The mystery began on Christmas Eve at Westfield Mission Valley mall. 

Macy’s had extended their shopping hours until 2am for Christmas shoppers.

Flint, who worked at a small shop in the mall, called 911 about 1:15 a.m. and said she had been shot. 

She said she did not know where she was but was somewhere near the mall.

Police found her and Salvatore Belvedere in a black sedan between Macy’s and a Christmas tree lot.

The pair had been shot in the head and upper body.

Found: Gianni Belevedere's body was found in the trunk of his own Toyota Camry in Riverside on Janaury 17

Ilona Flint, 22, and the little brother of her 
fiancé, Salvatore Belvedere, 22, died from gunshot wounds after being 
attacked outside this San Diego mall on December 24, 2013

Flint is believed to have given some information about the suspect during the 911 call.

She died at the scene, while Belvedere died two days later.

Police quickly determined that Gianni Belvedere was missing. 

They did not identify him as a suspect, but as a missing person at risk.

His decomposing body was found in the trunk of his green Toyota Camry about three weeks later, on January 17, in the parking lot of a restaurant in Riverside, over 90 miles from the crime scene.

A resident had reported a foul odor while passing the vehicle.

In late January, San Diego homicide investigators said they were looking for an unidentified person of interest in the mall slayings.

Family and friends fatheried in San Diego earlier this year to stage a vigil for the death of brothers Gianni and Salvatore Belevedere

A man wearing tan pants and a black hooded sweatshirt with white stripes around the upper arms had been seen in the mall hours before the shootings. 

Police said he may have driven off in a 2008 to 2011 dark gray Honda sedan.

Homicide investigators booked Mercado about 7.30 am. Saturday.

'The
 detectives told us an arrest had been made for all three murder 
victims,' Antoinette Belvedere, a sister of the boys, told UT San Diego at the weekend.

'Upon hearing this, our family was overcome with emotion and relieved at the same time.'

She said the family gave the police their 'deepest appreciation and thanks'.
