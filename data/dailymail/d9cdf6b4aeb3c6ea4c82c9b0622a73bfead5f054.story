ABC managing director Mark Scott has shaken off the viral campaign to get a Taylor Swift song to enter Triple J's Hottest 100.

The media boss issued a tweet on Thursday responding to the #Tay4Hottest100 campaign, which has taken the internet by storm.

'It's gonna be alright @triplej,' Scott wrote on Twitter, with a link to a story about the trending hashtag.

In his tweet, Mark Scott (right) made another reference to Taylor Swift's (left) song Shake It Off, which topped music charts around the world

The line references the U.S. pop singer's song Shake It Off, which is at the centre of the campaign.

It kicked off after Joe McKenzie tweeted Scott about the omission of Swift's hit from the Triple J's Hottest 100 voting list.

'Triple J is refusing to let me vote for Taylor Swift in the Hottest 100 I personally blame @mcscott [Scott's Twitter handle],' he wrote.

To which, Scott replied: 'Shake it off Joe.'

This tweet sparked a social media campaign, with fans of Swift boycotting the Australia Day tradition by voting for her songs.

Triple J - which is controlled by the ABC - allows voters to manually enter their selections, so some decided to abuse that privilege.

'So this just happened,' Rachael Tomic tweeted including a photo of her top 10 votes, which were all Taylor Swift songs.

While Venessa Paech threw her support behind Swift.

'If we're being honest we'd admit Shake if Off is a better crafted song than most of the noise on JJJ,' she said.

Supporters have taken to Twitter, sharing their Hottest 100 votes on the social media site

Even the Australian Bureau of Statistics weighed in on the debate, saying: 'Shake it off, Australia! The Census gives no insights into how many ‘Haters’ there are in Australia. #Tay4hottest100.'

Others against the move to include Shake It Off on the list were also vocal on the matter.

'It was hard enough to narrow down to 10 songs without losing one of those to Taylor Swift. Sorry TayTay,' Anna tweeted. 

Shake It Off is amongst the most favoured to take out number one spot on the Hottest 100, according to betting agencies.

Even the ABS got on board the bandwagon, tweeting this gem on Wednesday afternoon

But with the supporters, there were also those who did not want Taylor Swift entering the charts

Sportsbet.com.au is paying $5 for the single to be the Outright Winner 2014 at the time of publication, while rival site sportingbet is also forking out the same amount but it is the third pick for a win. 

Swift's single Shake It Off has topped charts around the world, including reaching number one on the ARIA Singles Chart when it was released last year.

The singer's album is still the highest selling album in Australia this week, according to the chart.

Triple's Hottest 100 counts down the top 100 songs of the year as voted by fans.

Songs that are eligible for the list this year have to be released between December 1, 2013 and November 30, 2014, according to the radio station's site.

A Triple J spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia she could not comment on the movement.

'We don't comment on voting campaigns whilst Hottest 100 voting is open, as it may influence the results of the poll,' she said.
