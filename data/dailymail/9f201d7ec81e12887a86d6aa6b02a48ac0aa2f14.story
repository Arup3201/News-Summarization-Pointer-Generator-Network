Raheem Sterling has been fined by the DVLA after problems emerged with the insurance of one of his cars.

The Liverpool midfielder was ordered to pay £600, plus £110 in court costs, after a charge was brought against him by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

The 20-year-old pleaded guilty to having a ‘motor vehicle which does not meet insurance requirements’ but is not thought to have driven the vehicle without proper insurance.

The former QPR man’s guilty plea is thought to have saved him from the maximum penalty for the offence - a £1000 fine.

The court stated the vehicle was registered to him under the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 but ‘it did not meet the requirements of section 144A of the Road Traffic Act 1988’.

The car in question is believed to be an Audi A3.
