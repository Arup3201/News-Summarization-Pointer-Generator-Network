Silvio Berlusconi has been sensationally cleared of having sex with underage exotic dancer Ruby the Heartstealer at his notorious 'bunga bunga' parties.

The former Italian premier, 77, had been sentenced to seven years jail for sex with the Moroccan former nightclub dancer, real name Karima-El Mahroug when she was just 17 and for using his influence to get her released from police cutody.

But in a shock verdict, judges in Milan overturned the conviction on appeal, saying that the facts 'do not constitute a crime.'

Cause for celebration: Former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi pictured today after his conviction for having sex with an underage exotic dancer was overturned

The billionaire politician, who had always denied having sex with Ruby at sordid sex parties at his palatial villa outside Milan said he was 'deeply moved' by the verdict.

He said: 'Only those close to me over the years know how I have suffered at these unjust and defamatory accusations.

'My first thoughts today go to my loved ones, who have suffered with me years of media aggression, gossip, slander, and who have remained beside me with unmatched affection and serenity.

'I have always said that the vast majority of Italian judges do their work quietly, with admirable balance and rigour, something that was confirmed today.'

Berlusconi was convicted for having sex with Karima El Mahroug, nicknamed 'Ruby the Heart Stealer' when she was 17

Berlusconi 
had always claimed the parties were 'elegant dinners' followed by 
burlesque cabaret, but the court heard of poledancing, strip teases and 
erotic games, all performed for the benefit of the master of the house.

A troupe of girls had received cash and gifts for attending the dinners.

The
 ex prime minister was also accused of telling police that Ruby was the 
niece of deposed Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarrak in order to get her 
released from jail.

But the judges said that these allegations were 'unfounded'.

The judges have three months to fully explain their reasoning. But lawyer for the defence Franco Coppi said it was a verdict that is 'even better our rosiest predictions.'  

He said: 'From a rational point of view the judges could not but absolve him. It could be that the judges said the crime did not exist because the ex-premier did not know that Ruby was underage.'

'The absolution for abuse of office is easier to understand', he said, 'because it means simply the proof is inexistent.'

The flamboyant politician heard the news at the old people's home where he is currently serving a one year sentence of community service for tax fraud in connection to the acquisition of rights for Hollywood films. The media mogul has been tried more than thirty times but convicted only once definitively.

The verdict could herald the start of a political comeback. While he has been banned from holding political office personally, Berlusconi is still head of the opposition centre right Forza Italia party.

In a brief statement read out in court, the judges fully acquitted 77-year old Berlusconi on both charges. They will release their motivations in 90 days.

'A verdict that goes beyond our rosiest expectations,' Berlusconi's lawyer Franco Coppi told reporters.

The four-times prime minister, still the most influential politician on the centre right, had always denied the charges, accusing the Milan magistrates of hounding him for political reasons.

'Finally justice has been done' said Simone Furlan of Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in a statement.

'Now, let's all focus on good politics to relaunch Forza Italia, tightly knit around our great leader Silvio Berlusconi.'

Friday's
 verdict in the most sensational trial faced by Berlusconi is not 
definitive as prosecutors could lodge an appeal with Italy's top court.

The former Italian prime minister was also accused of telling police that Ruby was the niece of deposed Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarrak in ordern to get her released from jail

The final ruling in the so-called Ruby trial could have implications for Berlusconi and his freedom to engage in political activity beyond the case itself.

As well as its implications for Berlusconi himself, the verdict removes a potential threat to Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's constitutional reform drive, which depends on an accord with the centre-right.

That accord could have been threatened had Berlusconi's conviction been upheld.

Berlusconi received a definitive conviction for tax fraud last year and was stripped of his seat in parliament.

He was given a four-year jail sentence, but that was commuted to a year's community service under a general amnesty, leaving him largely free to campaign in elections and play a political role.

However, a second definitive conviction in a criminal trial would violate the terms of the amnesty. That could mean Berlusconi would have to serve time under house arrest.
