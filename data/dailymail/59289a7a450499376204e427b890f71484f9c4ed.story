Manchester City's new £200million training complex is nearing completion, with first-team stars including David Silva, Vincent Kompany and Frank Lampard taking in their new surroundings next to their Etihad Stadium home.

The Premier League champions are putting the finishing touches on the sprawling state-of-the-art centre that will replace their current Carrington base.

And members of the first team have been taking a look at the new set-up which includes training facilities for players of all levels, on-site accommodation, 16 pitches and a 7,000-capacity stadium.

One mural within the new centre includes a message from club owner Sheikh Mansour, which reads: 'My intention is that Manchester City has the very best people at its disposal, both on and off the field.'

The centre has taken more than three years - and the work of more than 1,000 people - to plan and build and City hope to have their first team established in the new base over the coming months.

They trained there for the first time on Wednesday, with manager Manuel Pellegrini overseeing a session with some of the club's returning international players.

Yaya Toure was among those absent though, as he scored Ivory Coast's first goal in their 4-3 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying defeat by DR Congo on Wednesday.

On-loan midfielder Lampard told City's YouTube channel: 'Obviously being new to the club I've heard all the lads talking about it (the new centre) and being excited themselves.

'I've heard so many amazing things and think we're going to be very lucky to be working here.

'I did love Carrington because there was a real kind of tradition. For a club like City now - and the way it's moving forward so quickly - I think this is such an important part of the next stage.'
