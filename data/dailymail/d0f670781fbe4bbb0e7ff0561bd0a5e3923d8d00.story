Wales international prop Paul James will rejoin the Ospreys next season from Aviva Premiership club Bath.

The Ospreys have confirmed a two-year deal for James, who left the Welsh region for Bath in 2012.

James, 32, has won 55 caps and is part of the Wales squad for next month's Tests against Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and South Africa.

James made 180 appearances for the Ospreys during a nine-year stint with them before moving to the west country.

And the Ospreys' swoop bucks a recent trend of top players heading out of Wales.

Ten member of Wales coach Warren Gatland's current squad play their club rugby in either England or France.

'A lot has changed at the Ospreys since I was last part of the set-up, but the team has started the season well and has impressed me,' James said.

James revealed he is impressed with the current Ospreys set-up and admits much has changed at the club

'It's obvious that there is a bigger picture that everybody is working towards, and that's important.

'There are some really exciting front-row players coming through the system who I am looking forward to working with, and while I can give them my experience, playing and training alongside them will also help me as well.

'I've had a great few years at Bath. I have really settled in well and the club has been great to me, so I want to finish on a high there this season before I head home for the next chapter.'

Ospreys chief executive Andrew Hore added: 'Although circumstances dictated that we have lost players over the last few years that we didn't want to release, we have always clearly said that when the business was on a more stable footing we would look to bring selected personnel back to the region, and this is exactly what we have done with Paul.

Prop James has made over 55 appearances for Wales after making his debut back in 2003 

'Now that the Rugby Services Agreement (with the Welsh Rugby Union) has been finalised and we have the additional finances that come with the new European Rugby Champions Cup, enabling us to bring Paul back next season, the next challenge is to look to secure the future of the young players that we have here at the region.'

James will be a loss to Bath, having established himself as part of an impressive front-row alongside England internationals Rob Webber and David Wilson.

'Paul has been an outstanding competitor for the club since his arrival,' Bath head coach Mike Ford said.

'He is a great leader, a guy who turns up to training with the right attitude every day and gives you everything he's got on match-day. We wish him the best of luck with his move.'
