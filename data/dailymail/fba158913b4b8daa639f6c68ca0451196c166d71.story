Pop-rocker Richard Marx has listed his Chicago mansion for sale at a record $18 million as he finalizes his divorce from wife of 25 years, Dirty Dancing actress Cynthia Rhodes.

Split: Richard Marx and his actress wife Cynthia Rhodes (seen here in 1994) confirmed their divorce in April. They are now selling their marital home

The couple - who have three adult sons, Brandon, 23, Lucas, 21, and Jesse, 20 - announced their split in April, but have been separated since July last year.

Their marital home is a sprawling nine-bedroom estate on Lake Michigan in Lake Bluff that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its design and history.

Marx and Rhodes purchased the three-story house for $4.7 million in 1997 when their children were young.

The 51-year-old singer, whose career has been built on love ballads like Right Here Now, said he has not spoken to anyone about what lead to the breakdown of his marriage - and intends to keep it that way.

'I wouldn't discuss that with even some of my close friends,' he told People.

'It's really nobody's business.

'What I will say is that I had the great fortune and blessing to not only be married to Cynthia for all those years, but to just share her company.

'There's not a finer human being.

'I'm very grateful that we were together, had three amazing sons and I can't say enough about what an amazing person she is and how lucky I was to share that time with her.'

Marx also denied that his new album, Beautiful Goodbye, was penned in the wake of the breakup.

'It has been a painful time,' he told the magazine.

'But I don't necessarily want to bury myself in songs about it, frankly, out of respect. 

'I have nothing but love and respect for my ex-wife and I don't really want to delve into that in songwriting so much. 

'Not to say that I never will, but I didn't feel like that's where I wanted to write from. 

'I wanted to write from a more positive, inspired, hopeful place.'

With the price tag set at $18 million, Marx's waterfront abode comes in at number four for the most expensive properties ever listed in the Chicago area, according to The Chicago Tribune.

In addition to the nine bedrooms, there are eight bathrooms, a home theater,  and a 8,000-square-foot recording studio attached to the house.

For an area notorious for its winters, there are also 19 fireplaces.
