A Starbucks barista says she endured years of sexual harassment from male co-workers - including the nickname 'big booty Holly' - and when she finally complained, she was fired for it.

Holly Wu, 27, is now suing Starbucks in federal court, alleging that the company failed to investigate her sexual harassment complaints.

Ms Wu, who worked at a Starbucks in Midtiown Manhattan, filed a formal complaint to the district manager in February after her co-workers fondled her and propositioned her for sex, the New York Daily News reports.

Wu says she was fired without warning from her Midtown Manhattan Starbucks three weeks after she filed a sexual harassment complaint

She says her co-workers also called her 'big booty Holly' and poked her in the bottom - despite her pleas not to.

The harassment didn't stop there, either. Her co-workers often showed her pornography at work, as well.

'It was very upsetting to work in that environment,' she told the Daily News.

Three weeks after she sent the email complaining about the harassment, she was fired without warning.

Her bosses told Ms Wu, a shift manager, that she was canned for asking a barista to work 45 minutes later.

Ms Wu says she was repeatedly propositioned for sex, fondled, massaged and shown pornography by her male co-workers

She says Starbucks refused to look into her complaint.

The federal lawsuit cites seven other cases filed for similar reasons since 2008.

Ms Wu said the company has a policy against sexual harassment - one that it violated by not investigating her complaint.

A spokesperson for Starbucks said the company doe not comment on pending lawsuits.

However, the company said it has no tolerance for sexual harassment at its stores.Â
