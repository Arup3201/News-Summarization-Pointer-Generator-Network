Looking straight at the camera, Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover seems to be looking almost inquisitively at its own robotic arm in the latest self portrait from the red planet.

The image in the latest of a series of self portraits from the red planet, and comes as Curiosity has been taking its first sniff of the planet's atmosphere.

Engineers say the analysis could lead to a new understanding of how Mars lost much of its original atmosphere.

Learning what happened to the Martian atmosphere will help scientists assess whether the planet ever was habitable.

The present atmosphere of Mars is 100 times thinner than Earth’s.

A set of instruments aboard the rover has ingested and analyzed samples of the atmosphere collected near the 'Rocknest' site in Gale Crater where the rover is stopped for research.

Findings from the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instruments suggest that loss of a fraction of the atmosphere, has been a significant factor in the evolution of the planet.

Initial results show an increase of 5 percent in heavier isotopes of carbon in the atmospheric carbon dioxide compared to estimates of the isotopic ratios present when Mars formed.

Scientists theorize that in Mars’ distant past its environment may have been quite different, with persistent water and a thicker atmosphere.

NASA’s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, or MAVEN, mission will investigate possible losses from the upper atmosphere when it arrives at Mars in 2014.

With these initial sniffs of Martian atmosphere, SAM also made the most sensitive measurements ever to search for methane gas on Mars.

Preliminary results reveal little to no methane.

Methane is of interest as a simple precursor chemical for life. On Earth, it can be produced by either biological or non-biological processes.

Methane has been difficult to detect from Earth or the current generation of Mars orbiters because the gas exists on Mars only in traces, if at all.

The Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) in Curiosity's SAM instrument provides the first search conducted within the Martian atmosphere for this molecule.

The initial SAM measurements place an upper limit of just a few parts methane per billion parts of Martian atmosphere, by volume, with enough uncertainty that the amount could be zero.

'Methane is clearly not an abundant gas at the Gale Crater site, if it is there at all.

'At this point in the mission we’re just excited to be searching for it,' said SAM TLS lead Chris Webster of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif.

This graphic below shows pieces of the Tunable Laser Spectrometer instrument, one of three instruments in the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite on NASA's Curiosity rover.

Curiosity 'sniffs' the martian atmosphere using a tunable laser

As seen in the top graphic, the Tunable Laser Spectrometer has two infrared lasers whose light is invisible to the human eye.

From the fore-optics chamber, they 
shoot beams into a type of measurement chamber called a multi-pass 
Herriot cell (shown in yellow in the middle).

Mars air is pumped into this cell and out again with a vacuum pump.

A detector, seen on the left of the graphic in gray, picks up the way these lasers are absorbed by the Martian air.

By this method, scientists can 
measure concentrations of methane, carbon dioxide and water vapor and 
different isotopes of those gases.

At the bottom left is a picture of a 
lab demonstration of the measurement chamber with visible lasers so 
scientists can see how they bounce between the mirrors in the chamber.

At bottom right is the flight 
hardware showing the lasers and the plate to which they are mounted. 
Also visible are the collimators, which are lenses that direct the 
lasers into the cell.

While we determine upper limits on low values, atmospheric variability in the Martian atmosphere could yet hold surprises for us.'

In Curiosity’s first three months on Mars, SAM has analyzed atmosphere samples with two laboratory methods.

One is a mass spectrometer investigating the full range of atmospheric gases.

The other, TLS, has focused on carbon dioxide and methane.

During its two-year prime mission, the rover also will use an instrument called a gas chromatograph that separates and identifies gases.

The instrument also will analyze samples of soil and rock, as well as more atmosphere samples.

'With these first atmospheric measurements we already can see the power of having a complex chemical laboratory like SAM on the surface of Mars,' said SAM Principal Investigator Paul Mahaffy of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.

'Both atmospheric and solid sample analyzes are crucial for understanding Mars’ habitability.'

SAM is set to analyze its first solid sample in the coming weeks, beginning the search for organic compounds in the rocks and soils of Gale Crater. Analyzing water-bearing minerals and searching for and analyzing carbonates are high priorities for upcoming SAM solid sample analyzes.

If the atmosphere of Mars contains methane, various possibilities have been proposed for where the methane could come from and how it could disappear.

Potential non-biological sources for methane on Mars include comets, degradation of interplanetary dust particles by ultraviolet light, and interaction between water and rock.

A potential biological source would be microbes, if microbes have ever lived on Mars.

Potential sinks for removing methane from the atmosphere are photochemistry in the atmosphere and loss of methane to the surface.

The latest self portraits from Mars were created from 55 individual photos - and interest in the rover is so great that one amateur astronomer beat Nasa releasing them.

The image, above, combines 55 photos taken 
with the rover’s MAHLI camera, which sits outstretched on the end of 
Curiosity’s arm.

The probe moved the camera to different positions in 
each image so the arm isn’t visible.

Amateur astronomer and science 
writer Stuart Atkinson stitched together the raw images that Curiosity 
beamed back to Earth on Oct 31, tweeting the picture and telling followers 'It's just a sneaky peek in advance of the official image being released by the MSL guys.'

However, he admitted the best is yet to come - so far, the rover has only sent back the
smaller, thumbnail versions of these images, with the full-sized ones 
arriving in the coming days.

NASAtoday released the high-res version.

The space agency has been making every image from Curiosity available to the public on a special web site, giving space fans an amazing insight into exactly what the rover is doing every day.

The rover has sent back several self portraits so far.

Engineers have been using the to check the rover's systems are operational.

They are also used to check its parts and moving correctly with barcodes on the rover that can be analysed to check it is the exact shape it should be.

Curiosity's last self portrait was a black and white landscape shot

This image shows a 'bite mark' where NASA's Curiosity rover scooped up some Martian soil.

The historic first scoop sample was taken from the 'Rocknest' patch of dust and sand on Oct. 7, 2012, the 61st sol, or Martian day, of operations.

A third scoop sample was collected on 
Oct. 15, or Sol 69, and deposited into the Chemistry and Mineralogy 
(CheMin) instrument on Oct. 17, or Sol 71. 

This image was taken by Curiosity's Mast
Camera. Scientists enhanced the color in this version to show the 
Martian scene as it would appear under lighting conditions on Earth, 
which helps in analyzing the terrain. 

During the two-year prime mission of the
Mars Science Laboratory Project, researchers are using Curiosity's 10 
instruments to investigate whether areas in Gale Crater ever offered 
environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.
