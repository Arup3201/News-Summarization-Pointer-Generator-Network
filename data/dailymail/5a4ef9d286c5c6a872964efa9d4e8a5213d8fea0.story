A gang of armed robbers who repeatedly fired a stun gun at a pawn shop manager in a £43,000 raid have been jailed for a total of 94 years.

David Sadiku, 41, and Kelly Day, 36, posed as a couple selling a Rolex watch to con their way into a pawnbroker’s in Ilford, Essex.

Once inside Maxcroft Securities Ltd, Sadiku pulled out a gun and dragged manager Naom Margolin out of his office while Day let fellow gang members - Paulius Strasunskas, 27, Francis Carbon, 32, Amjit Bharj, 47, and Aamir Kayani, 31 - into the shop.

Mr Margolin was shocked up to ten 
times with the stun gun and pistol-whipped in the face but managed to press the panic button, while a woman employee was stunned in the face.

The gang escaped with £43,000 worth of cash and jewellery, but were today behind bars after they were foiled during another robbery at a convenience store.

Sadiku and Day pleaded guilty 
to taking part in the Maxcroft robbery and the others were convicted 
following a nine-week trial at Old Bailey.

Another
 man, Michael Carbon, 26, who was involved in the mini-supermarket raid confessed to armed robbery, and was found guilty of a gun charge.

During the raid on July 5, last year Carbon told at staff at 
Maxcroft ‘I will f****** kill you’ as he demanded they 
empty their desks, while Strasunskas demanded: ‘Where’s the 
f****** money’.

He then put a stun gun to the face of one of the female 
members of staff and fired it at point blank range, the court was told.

‘She heard a 
cracking noise and felt a lot of pain. What had happened is he had used 
the stun gun on her face,’ said prosecutor Kerry Broome during the nine week trial.

‘Her face was swollen and painful.

‘There was no need at all for anyone to administer a Taser, led alone to the face.

‘He also administered the same gun to Mr Margolin’s head and neck area.’

Two customers were also forced to hand over wedding jewellery they were attempting to retrieve from the pawnbroker’s.

On June 25, just a few days before the attack at the pawnbroker's, the gang had tried to raid a Muslim wedding celebration after it had been announced in the local paper. 

One wedding guest was Tasered in the face by the gang, but still managed to stop them from entering the home.

Then on August 8, officers from the Flying Squad - who had been following the gang since the Maxcroft robbery - swooped on gang members during a raid on Milap mini-supermarket in Chadwell Heath, east London.

Sadiku,
 Strasunskas, Carbon, Kayani, Day, and Bharj, were linked to the 
Maxcroft raid, while Michael Carbon was identified as 
part of the gang in the third robbery. 

Michael 
Carbon and Strasunkas threatened staff with a handgun, stealing cash and other valuables before were stopped by armed police as they tried to escape.

Francis Carbon and Kayani, who were acting as a getaway driver and a lookout, were arrested nearby.

 of Walthamstow, east London, admitted to 
aggravated burglary, burglary, two counts of robbery, two counts of 
carrying a firearm with criminal intent, two counts of possession of a 
prohibited weapon and one count of possessing a firearm with intent to 
commit an offence.

He was jailed for a total of 13 years.

He was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Michael Carbon, 26, of Plaistow, east London, was convicted of burglary, robbery, and possession of a firearm. He was jailed for ten years.

Sentencing, Judge Nigel Seed QC told the gang: ‘The stun gun was used in the face of a female employee as well as several times on the manager.

‘The female employees were terrified, and one heard a shout of “I’ll f****** kill you”.

‘The employees were subjected to violence and forced at gunpoint to hand over the contents of their desk drawers.

‘An innocent couple of customers there redeeming family jewellery and gold had that taken as well.

‘This had been carefully planned.’
