Morbidly obese workers should be treated as ‘disabled’ by their bosses, one of Europe’s top lawyers ruled yesterday.

Niilo Jaaskinen, Advocate General at the European Court of Justice, said that ‘extreme, severe or morbid’ obesity prevents staff from a full ‘participation in professional life’.

Mr Jaaskinen’s ruling on a test case at the Luxembourg court could lead to bosses across Europe – including in Britain – being banned from discriminating against fat employees.

The Advocate General was asked to rule on a case brought by 25st child-minder Karsten Kaltoft, who was sacked by a local authority in Denmark for being unable to perform basic duties due to his size.

The council, Billund Kommune, claimed the child-minder was so fat that he required help from a colleague to tie up children’s shoelaces.

Mr Jaaskinen found EU law does not prohibit discrimination specifically on the grounds of obesity. But he said those with extreme obesity, classified as having a body mass index (BMI) of more than 40, could be considered disabled. A healthy BMI score, which is based on weight and height, is between 18 and 25.

He said: ‘If obesity has reached such a degree that it plainly hinders participation in professional life, then this can be a disability.’ He added that just because obesity is ‘self-inflicted’ it is not any less worthy of being classed as a ‘disability’ than other afflictions.

Although his judgment is not binding, it will be used by the ECJ as a basis for deciding whether Mr Kaltoft’s obesity is a disability under EU law, and whether his employer was guilty of discrimination by dismissing him. And if the ECJ stick to Mr Jaaskinen’s ruling, it could result in widespread changes to workplace disability laws.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘If this opinion becomes the Court’s ruling, then the law is either an ass or barking mad. To give morbidly obese people the right to sue their employers if they become so fat that they cannot do the job they have signed up to do is beyond belief. The mind boggles as to the likely cost to employers if the Court decides to accept this opinion.’

Decision: Jaaskinen ruled on a case involving 25-stone child-minder Karsten Kaltof, who was sacked by a local council in Denmark because he was unable to perform 'basic duties'

Glenn Hayes, an employment law expert at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘It will be interesting to see how the UK courts interpret this opinion as it seems to take us a little further down the road to obesity being recognised as a disability.

‘If being obese means that an individual cannot perform the essential duties of their role and this condition is likely to be long-term, then the duty to make reasonable adjustments probably kicks in, even if there is no underlying cause or illness.

‘This could mean that employers could find themselves under a legal obligation to make adjustments such as providing car park spaces close to the workplace entrance for obese employees, providing special desks ... or possibly even ensuring that healthy meal options are provided at their staff canteen.

‘Employers will certainly be looking at this opinion closely because the repercussions could be significant.’
