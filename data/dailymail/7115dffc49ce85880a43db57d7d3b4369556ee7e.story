Stick or twist? That was the dilemma for Wasps. Move or die? They have taken the right decision, but they are going in the wrong direction.

Sentiment and tradition are all very well, but in the professional era they sometimes have to give way to cold, hard reality. Wasps’ tenancy in High Wycombe wasn’t working. Crowds of 5-6,000 simply won’t suffice. No wonder the club have been losing £3million a year.

The announcement of their relocation to Coventry has been accompanied by an outcry on behalf of the supporters, but a lack of them is one of the primary problems. Of course, the loyal followers who turn up at game after game are entitled to vent their angst, but the bottom line is that the club had to gamble on developing a larger fan-base elsewhere. It is brutal. It is business. That’s modern sport – for better or worse.

Wasps’ training ground in Acton is sub-standard, as is the venue they have played in for so long. Shifting to the Ricoh Arena and – eventually – a new, purpose-built training ground in Coventry makes sense in terms of facilities and growth potential, but not in terms of geography.

Why the West Midlands? This column’s misgivings are not sentimental ones. Wasps may have been a ‘London’ club for the bulk of their long history, but in the professional era they have drifted, from Sudbury to Shepherd’s Bush and on to Buckinghamshire – 30 miles from the capital. Alternative options in their familiar territory were considered and discarded.

They have decided to take the caravan to a large city with a strong rugby heritage, which is wise, but it is in a congested area of elite clubs. Worcester are angry at what they regard as rivals parking a tank on their lawn, with some justification. Leicester are even nearer – just 24 miles away and Northampton are also in close proximity.

A major sponsorship deal partly explains the choice of location, but they had a prime chance to expand the map of the sport in this country, which is too narrow. Large swathes of the south and east represent an untapped market.

Three regular starters in the England team; Joe Marler, Joe Launchbury and Billy Twelvetrees, come from Sussex and the impressive Brighton Community Stadium is hosting World Cup matches next year. Why not harness that galvanising factor and head for the coast? There are potentially suitable stadia in Hampshire and Kent too, or Suffolk and Norfolk – where the Youngs brothers hail from.

Places exist where an ambitious club could establish strong roots, without straying on to patches which are already occupied. But now that Wasps have made their decision, more pertinent even than the grievance of fans will be the views of the players.

If their leading men are prepared to embrace the relocation and strong links are forged with Coventry Rugby Club and Coventry City FC, the move may not be doomed to failure as many suggest. But if life away from London doesn’t appeal to the likes of Joe Launchbury, James Haskell and Christian Wade – leading to a break-up of the current squad – the venture is destined to fail. 

Good news for Leicester and England – Manu Tuilagi is back. The wrecking-ball centre has recovered from a persistent groin problem to start for the Tigers in Friday night's Aviva Premiership clash against Harlequins at Welford Road. How the East Midlands club need him. With Tuilagi in midfield, they won their first two games of the season. In his absence, they have lost three on the bounce. If Leicester are beaten on Friday night, it would be the first time in a decade they have lost four in a row, but Tuilagi’s timely return means Vereniki Goneva reverts to the wing and Mathew Tait is fit to resume at full back. Argentina prop Marcos Ayerza has completed the long-haul trek from Mendoza to a place on the Tigers’ bench, six days after being at the vanguard of his country’s historic victory over Australia. Tom Croft is missing again – which suggests that his knee injury is worse than first thought. Meanwhile, Quins have recalled Will Collier at tighthead prop in an otherwise unchanged side.

The backlash has begun. Just four days after Sam Burgess’s selfless heroics for South Sydney Rabbitohs in the NRL Grand Final, rugby league authorities in Australia have asked the club to explain why the Yorkshireman was allowed to play the whole game with a broken cheekbone and eye socket. At a time when concussion is a hot topic, acclaim for Burgess’s brave contribution to an epic triumph has been superseded by accusations that he shouldn’t have been allowed to keep taking so many punishing hits when he had already incurred significant damage. The 25-year-old has had four metal plates inserted into his face and his cross-code move to Bath has been delayed by a month, at least, as he recovers from surgery. His staggering commitment last Sunday served to whet union’s appetite – beyond the confines of the West Country – for their next convert. Burgess is a prodigious talent and a true warrior, but Bath and England must be prepared to occasionally save him from himself.

Rugby’s gravy train continues to rumble on in France. The All Blacks’ playmaker, Dan Carter, is angling for a return to the Gallic game – after a previous, injury-wrecked stint at Perpignan – and the asking price is thought to be EU1million per year. That was the figure that Racing Metro reportedly offered in a vain attempt to lure Matt Giteau from Toulon, so the Parisian club’s owner, Jacky Lorenzetti, won’t want to miss out on another iconic southern hemisphere player to replace the departing Jonathan Sexton. Initial indications are that Toulon won’t enter this particular auction, so Racing may have a clear run, as even most rich French clubs will baulk at an unprecedented seven-figure salary. Carter’s fitness and playing powers may be in gradual decline, but he remains a stellar talent with commercial clout – the world’s ultimate bums-on-seats signing.

Last Word – The state of turmoil in Australian rugby is reaching critical levels. Last weekend, the Wallabies became Argentina’s first victims in the Rugby Championship, as their scrum and discipline disintegrated. Amid fears about a post-World Cup player exodus, the outlook for Kurtley Beale looks increasingly bleak as he faces an investigation over allegations of sending ‘inappropriate and deeply offensive’ texts about a member of ARU staff. Meanwhile, Robbie Deans has released a book savaging the players who capitulated to the Lions last year, in his final match as national coach, and Giteau has shown Australia what they are missing by earning the award for Player of the Year in France’s Top 14 league. All this comes against a backdrop of panic that the ARU could be insolvent next year, as revenues have slumped. Trouble and strife Down Under won’t elicit much sympathy in these parts, but it is not good for the game at large. The Wallabies are stumbling towards next year’s World Cup, but Pool A opponents England and Wales should be wary of seeing them as easy prey.
