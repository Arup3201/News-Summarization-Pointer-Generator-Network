It is one of the most adnaved surveillance systems ever created - and could already be flying above you.

Researchers have revealed a plane-mounted camera system called Hawkeye that can survey a 25 square mile patch of a city for up to six hours.

It allows police to zoom in to crimes, and even 'rewind' the video to see them being instigated.

The system allows police to zoom in on crimes in real time, such as this car chase where police could see suspects driving in real time.

The Hawkeye system kits out planes with an array of high-resolution cameras.

The cameras are angled to capture the largest area, and can capture a 25-square-mile patch of Earth constantly for up to six hours.

They fly at around 10,000 feet.

Footage is beamed back to a police control room, where officer can zoom in, and even rewind the footage.

The system was developed by Ross McNutt, a retired Air Force veteran who owns a company called Persistent Surveillance Systems.

McNutt told the Center for Investigative Reporting his product as 'a live version of Google Earth, only with TiVo capabilities.'

The firm  kits out planes with an array of high-resolution cameras that allow a pilot to record a 25-square-mile patch of Earth constantly—for up to six hours.

The planes fly at around 10,000 feet.

The PSS system has been tested in cities including Baltimore and Dayton, and last year police officers in Compton used it to track crimes, including a necklace snatching.

In one case, they could track a criminal as he approached a woman, grabbed her jewelry, and then ran to a getaway car.

'We literally watched all of Compton during the time that we were flying, so we could zoom in anywhere within the city of Compton and follow cars and see people,” McNutt said.

'Our goal was to basically jump to where reported crimes occurred and see what information we could generate that would help investigators solve the crimes.'

The firm boasts it has worked with forces across the US to develop the system.

'Persistent Surveillance Systems has assisted law enforcement organizations throughout the United States with over 30 murder investigations since 2007.

'The hawkeye system and image analysis have directly led to the apprehension of violent offenders.'

The system is also relatively cheap, and PSS says each unit cost less than a fully equipped police helicopter - but can cover 10,000 times the area.

 The firm behind the Hawkeye system says officers have used imagery to:1. Backtrack murder suspects to their homes/places of origin

2. Track suspects to every location they went to before, during, and after the crime

3. Identify potential accomplices of the suspect

4. Track each accomplice to every location they went to before, during and after the crime

5. Identify EXACTLY what time and location a suspect or accomplice drove by a ground-based security camera.

6. Dissect entire criminal networks in 3 - 4 days.
