'Not what was intended': Labour's justice spokesman Sadqid Khan, said the European Courts were having too much influence in the UK

Labour finally admitted  yesterday that its controversial Human Rights Act has left Britain’s courts ‘dancing to the tune of Strasbourg’.

After years of doggedly defending the legislation, shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan admitted the need for significant changes.

In future, he said, Britain’s own Supreme Court should normally be given the final say in appeals instead of the remote European Court of Human Rights.

Mr Khan added that British judges would no longer have to obey every edict although they would still have to consider rulings by the court in Strasbourg.

The intervention was seen as a blatant attempt to snatch votes from the Conservatives, who are poised to unveil long-awaited reforms to human rights laws.

Tory MPs said Mr Khan’s comments amounted to the first admission by Labour that the Act had caused mayhem.

Dominic Raab, who has campaigned for reform, said: ‘After years of denial, Labour admit their Human Rights Act has skewed our justice system.

‘Frankly, they should be on their knees apologising to the British public for the damage done.’

Labour was in power in 1998 when the HRA was passed, enshrining the European Convention on Human Rights into British law. Since then, the measure has been blamed for blocking the deportation of countless illegal immigrants and foreign criminals as judges have slavishly adhered to Strasbourg case law.

Mr Khan said this had not been the original intention. He pledged that a future Labour government would issue new guidance to stop ‘the sovereignty of our courts and the will of Parliament’ being called into question.

‘I want British courts to be clear that they don’t have to dance to the tune of Strasbourg,’ he said.

‘That’s not what was intended when the legislation was drafted and debated in Parliament in 1998.

‘It’s not good for our own domestic system of justice to be totally bound by what goes on at the European Court of Human Rights. Too often, rather than “taking into account” Strasbourg rulings and finding their own way, our courts have acted as if these rulings were binding on their decisions.’

Under
 the plan, people would still be able to take their appeal cases to 
Strasbourg but British courts would be able to disagree with what the 
ECHR said

Labour admit its action would do nothing to resolve the thorny issue of Strasbourg’s ruling that prisoners should have the vote. Officials said the case, which dates back to 2005, is ‘too far down the line’.

Mr Khan insisted that the party’s plans did not alter ‘Labour’s unswerving support for the Human Rights Act’.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘This is just gesture politics and will do nothing to deliver the real change this country needs.’

Before Mr Khan’s admission in an article in The Daily Telegraph, shadow ministers had repeatedly defended the legislation.

In 2011, Mr Khan said: ‘The Act is the most significant defence for ordinary people against state power ever passed into law.

‘When Tory ministers blame the Act, it’s usually an excuse not to sort out the problem or a cover for their own failing policies.’

As Justice Secretary in 2008, Jack Straw said he could understand public concerns but blamed a few ‘nervous’ judges.

Yesterday, the Mail reported the latest controversial judgment made under the Act’s Article 8, the right to a family life.

Judges ruled a nurse from Ghana who force-fed her baby to death cannot be deported after serving her three-year sentence. Ministers have vowed to appeal.

Review: Harriet Harman suggested that licence fee alternatives should be looked at

Alternatives to the licence fee should be examined when the BBC’s charter is renewed in 2016, said  Harriet Harman yesterday.

The comments of Labour’s deputy leader are the first sign of possible cross-party support for an end to the £145.50 annual charge.

Miss Harman, who is also shadow culture secretary, said: ‘The licence fee is a means to an end, it’s not an end to itself.

‘It’s not easy to see what would be better but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be looked at.

‘What we are not up for is a kind of ideological attack on the BBC because it is a public sector broadcaster.’

In an interview with Total Politics magazine, she also urged Culture Secretary Sajid Javid to appoint a BBC Trust chairman to replace Lord  Patten on an impartial basis.

Earlier, writer Armando Iannucci suggested the BBC could become a subscription TV service like Sky.
