The pregnant Duchess of Cambridge has been forced to pull out of tonight's opening ceremony of the Invictus Games due to her continuing sickness.

Kate, 32, who is expecting her second child by husband, Prince William, had been desperate to support her brother-in-law, Prince Harry.

But doctors caring for her at Kensington Palace told aides this morning that she would not be well enough to join other members of the Royal Family at the Olympic Park in London tonight.

Suffering: The pregnant Duchess of Cambridge has been forced to pull out of tonight's opening ceremony of the Invictus Games due to her continuing sickness, despite having been desperate to support Prince Harry

Missing out: Kate's first solo foreign visit to Malta on behalf of the Queen next weekend is also in jeopardy

She has also been forced to cancel plans to attend a solemn Drumhead service at Lee Valley Athletics Centre with the Duke and Prince Harry tomorrow, to remember all those who have died or been injured in conflict, and later, with William, watch Invictus competitors taking part in matches and heats. 

In a statement, Kensington Palace said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge will not attend the Opening Ceremony of the Invictus Games this evening or the Athletics event tomorrow.'

They also made clear that her first solo foreign visit to Malta on behalf of the Queen next weekend was very much in jeopardy.

'The Duchess's attendance on the forthcoming visit to Malta will be kept under review and a decision taken closer to the time,' they said.

Kate is believed to be around seven weeks pregnant with her second baby but has sadly been hit by the same severe vomiting condition that blighted her first. 

A source told Mail Online: 'If she continues to be as sick as she has been in recent days then all bets are off as regards her royal duties.' 

She is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, which she experienced during the early stages of her first pregnancy. 

Advice: David Beckham, who has known William for a number of years, has advised the couple to 'get more sleep' before the birth of their second child

The condition, which affects 3.5 per 1,000 pregnancies, causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis.

It is thought her illness began sometime last week and when William visited Oxford University on Monday without his wife to open the institution’s new China Centre, he said the Duchess had experienced a 'tricky few days'. 

David Beckham today offered his words of advice to William and Kate - get more sleep before their second baby arrives.

As the father of four children, the former England footballer is speaking from experience and reacted to news of the royal pregnancy by praising the couple's parenting skills.

Speaking during an interview with ITV’s Lorraine show, Beckham gave the couple some words of wisdom: 'Get some sleep because jumping from one child to two is a big step even though I thought jumping from two to three was bigger.'

The former England midfielder was interviewed at New York fashion week where he is promoting his new collection for the brand Belstaff.

Beckham has known William for a number of years having joined forces with him to promote England’s bid to host the 2018 World Cup, launched wildlife conservation campaigns with the Duke and been a guest at his wedding.

The sportsman added: 'But I’m so happy for them both because they’re such great parents and obviously to be great parents and to have the roles that they have, as important as they have, is really incredible and I’m just happy that they’re going to have another little one running around the house.'

The Prince of Wales greeted the news that he is to become a grandfather for a second time with joy and said he hoped the baby was a girl.

Yesterday, during a visit to the studio of a young entrepreneur who has been helped by his Prince’s Trust  said he would like a granddaughter.

As he left the premises in Bermondsey, South London he met Corey Johnson who congratulated him on becoming a grandfather for the second time.

The heir to the throne replied: 'I am already. But it’s wonderful to be a grandfather again. I’m looking forward to it - but I hope it will be a girl this time.'

Treatment: Kate leaves the King Edward VII Hospital in December 2012, where she was treated for hyperemesis gravidarum during her last pregnancy

Hyperemesis gravidarum is common, affecting around 15 per cent of all pregnancies. However in its extreme form - where a pregnant woman is admitted to hospital or suffers the condition throughout her pregnancy - it is much more rare.

It is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers, and often develops around six weeks into the pregnancy, continuing until around 12 weeks.

The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception.

Leila Hanna, Consultant Gynaecologist and Obstetrician at Queen Mary's Hospital in London and BMI The Sloane Hospital, told MailOnline: 'The condition is extremely common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

'It is associated with the changes in hormonal levels in the body, where the pregnancy hormones are quite high and it is the effect of those on the expectant mother.

'If anything it is associated with a normal, healthy pregnancy.' 

The Duke of Cambridge indicated his wife may be over the worst of her morning sickness in a 'few weeks' time' when he appeared in Oxford on Monday, following the announcement of her pregnancy. 

Hyperemesis gravidarum leads to severe dehydration and puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients. Sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences.

They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week.

This can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food.

Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated.

The condition can also affect the baby’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight. In severe cases, the sickness can trigger a miscarriage.

But it did not seem to be a problem for Prince George – he was born a healthy 8lb 6oz, the heaviest future king in 100 years – and was several days overdue.

In less severe cases the condition can be managed with supplementary hydration, medication and nurtrients. Some women take vitamin B6 – which prevents sickness – as soon as they know they are pregnant. Others may take stronger anti-nausea tablets such as cyclizine, which is also used to treat travel sickness and is said to be very effective.

Sufferers are advised to take plenty of fluids and try to have small snacks throughout the day as an empty stomach can trigger nausea. If they cannot keep food down they will need anti-sickness medication and to be put on a drip.

Miss Hanna said Kate is more susceptible to suffering hyperemesis gravidarum, having endured the acute sickness during her pregnancy with Prince George.

She said: 'If you have suffered this condition before, it is more likely you will again.'
