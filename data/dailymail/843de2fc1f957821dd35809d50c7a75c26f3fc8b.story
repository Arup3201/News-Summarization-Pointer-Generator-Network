A crocodile was resting in the sun when it was suddenly pounced upon by three feisty lions.

A spell-binding video documented the epic struggle between some of nature's toughest wildlife - but who will win?

The tussle was filmed at the Samburu National Reserve in Kenya, home to hundreds of different species of birds and animals.

The short film shows an intrepid lions gradually approaching the crocodile, which is resting in shallow water.

As the lion gets closer the crocodile opens his jaw, ready to fight.

But as it looks like the crocodile is ready to pounce, two more lions rush over to join in the scuffle.

All three lunge at the reptile, which thrashes around in a bid to escape the big cats' teeth from sinking into its scales.

After a few seconds the crocodile is back on the offensive, despite being outnumbered, sending splashes of water into the air as it faces up to the trio of attackers.

In the next section of the film, two of them have temporarily moved away to find their next adventure - only to return when they see their big cat comrade squaring up to the crocodile once more.

They clash again, this time the bravest of the trio attempting to put his paw on the reptile's head, clearly angering the creature.

The trio dive on the crocodile, who thrashes around, jaw wide open, defending itself and its territory.

It seems like it's time might be up, as the beasts circle it from all side, one leaping on its tail to pin it down.

But the group fail to make the critical, final plunge, hesitating just enough to give the crocodile time for a counter-attack.

Instead, it looks like the big cats want to keep their prey alive, so they can play with it some more.

In the end they trot off and the crocodile is left alone to lounge in the sun - and all live to fight another day.
