A Georgia widow convicted of lying to investigators after her lover shot dead her husband four years ago, could be released from prison as early as June.

Andrea Sneiderman is serving a five-year sentence after a court found her guilty of perjury and hindering the investigation into the November 2010 fatal shooting of her husband, Rusty, by her lover and former supervisor at GE Energy, Hemy Neuman.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the mother-of-two was eligible for release today, but the State Board of Pardons and Paroles determined she should serve an additional two months.

'The board’s decision follows the clemency guidelines recommendation of 22 months to serve prior to parole,' board spokesman Steve Hayes said in a news release.

He said a final decision will be made in June and, if approved, an exact parole release date will be set.

Sneiderman spent nearly a year under 
house arrest after she was charged in August 2012 with conspiring to kill her husband. Those charges were dropped just before her trial commenced
 in late July last year.

During her lover's murder trial in 2012, she testified that she 'didn’t
 know what happened to Rusty until I got to the emergency room. No one 
told me what happened to Rusty', Fox Atlanta reported.

She also denied to police that she was in a relationship with Neuman.

Prosecutors
 accused her of making false statements 
to police investigating her husband's slaying and lying under oath 
during Neuman's trial.

Last year, she was found guilty of four counts of perjury, hindering the apprehension of a criminal, concealment of material facts, and three counts of giving false statements.

Guilty: Hemy Neuman (pictured at his sentencing in 2012) was found guilty of shooting Rusty Sneiderman outside a Dunwoody preschool in 2010

Meanwhile her lover, Hemy Neuman, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 
life in prison in March 2012, but found to be mentally ill.

The court found him guilty of shooting dead 36-year-old 
Rusty Sneiderman outside a suburban 
Atlanta preschool while he was dropping his son off.

He told mental health examiners 
he was visited by a demon whose voice sounded like Barry White and an 
angel who looked like Olivia Newton-John.

The angel ordered him to 
fatally shoot Sneiderman, Neuman said in one interview.
