Iran has rejected Obama's offer to discuss their nuclear programme saying the U.S. was proposing talks while 'pointing a gun at Iran.'

The refusal came as state television broadcast footage allegedly extracted from a CIA drone captured in 2011.

The black and white video shows an aerial view of an airport and a city, said to be Kandahar in Afghanistan.

The release comes at a sensitive time as
the U.S. increased sanctions on Iran on yesterday, aiming to tighten a 
squeeze on Tehran's ability to spend oil cash.

View from the sky: Iran's state TV has broadcast footage allegedly extracted from a CIA drone captured in 2011

Location: The black and white footage shows an aerial view of an airport and a city, said to be Kandahar in Afghanistan

Claims: Tehran has long claimed it managed to reverse-engineer the RQ-170 Sentinel and that it is capable of launching its own production line for the unmanned aircraft

Tehran has long claimed it managed to 
reverse-engineer the RQ-170 Sentinel and that it is capable of launching
its own production line for the unmanned aircraft.

The drone was used for covert 
surveillance such as the operation to spy on the Pakistan compound of 
Osama Bin Laden before he was killed in a U.S. raid in May.

The TV also showed images purported to be the Sentinel landing at a base in eastern Iran.

Narrating the video, the
Revolutionary Guard's air space chief, General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, says
in one part that only after Iran captured the drone did it realise it 'belongs to the CIA.'

Iranian officials have said the drone 
came down over eastern Iran in December 2011, hundreds of miles from the cluster of 
nuclear sites in the central and north-west of the country.

Malfunction: U.S. officials claim the drone broke down, but cannot explain how it was still in relatively pristine condition when found by the Iranians

Iran claims it 'took control of the drone and landed it' but US officials have said it malfunctioned and had to land.

'This aircraft has carried out many operations in the countries around Iran,' the narrator says.

'In the operations taken place in Pakistan, this aircraft guided many of the clashes ...

Iran believes it can 'mass produce' the captured drone by 'reverse engineering' the aircraft.

When the drone went missing President Obama made it clear the U.S. wanted the top-secret aircraft back.

'We have asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond,' Obama said during a White House news conference.

But in a later interview Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made it clear his country would not grant the U.S. request.

'The Americans have perhaps decided to give us this spy plane,' Ahmadinejad said.

'We now have control of this plane.'

Speaking through an interpreter, Ahmadinejad said: 'There are people here who have been able to control this spy plane, who can surely analyze this plane's system also. … In any case, now we have this spy plane.'

At the time Obama wouldn't comment on what the Iranians might learn from studying the downed aircraft.

Defense
Secretary Leon Panetta said it's difficult to know 'just frankly how 
much they're going to be able to get from having obtained those parts.'

Request: President Obama during a 2011 White House news conference when he asked for the drone back

Panetta said the request to return the drone was appropriate. 'I don't expect that that will happen,' he said.

'But I think it's important to make that request.'

Former U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney blasted Mr Obama for his soft approach in trying to get the surveillance plane back, insisting he should have ordered an airstrike over Iran instead.

He told CNN: 'The right response would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it.

'You can do that from the air and, in effect, make it impossible for them to benefit from having captured that drone, but [Obama] asked nicely for them to return it, and they aren't going to.'
