This is officially my start to the season. Back to work, picking my 10 players for Sportsmail... and then watching to see how they fare through the campaign. Some of these picks are obvious because they are big-money buys but I hope you will agree there are some surprise names, too.

There isn’t a Manchester City player but that’s because there is no mystery about their squad. Leave a comment below and let me know your players to watch. Enjoy the season!

No 1: Alexis Sanchez 

Arsenal fans might tell you they didn’t expect to see another fast winger type coming in but you can’t ignore the chance to sign the electrifying Chilean.

Sanchez is the most exciting signing of the summer so far and I hope he settles quickly. He played wide for Barcelona but still has a very good goal return (39 goals in 88 league games).

When you play with Lionel Messi, you won’t get much of the central ground but I expect to see more of him through the middle in the Barclays Premier League.

Wherever he plays, his unbelievable pace will hurt defenders. Expect to see him on the ball often and opening up his body to dribble at pace.

Stellar signing: Alexis Sanchez brings pace, trickery and menace to Arsenal's forward line. Watch out!

The leader of the pack: Sanchez gives Arsenal an extra dimension and should become a huge hit with fans

No 2: Ander Herrera

Manchester United have spent a long time trying to replace Paul Scholes and now they have found their man.

I call him a ‘ticker’... he gets it and he gives it and he keeps the team ticking along, just like his compatriots Andres Iniesta and Xavi. 

He can hit a long pass too but most of his work will be pass-and-move in the middle of the park.

One fault is that he doesn’t score enough goals and Manchester United need more from that area of the pitch.

The new Scholes: Ander Herrera will keep things ticking over in midfield, but he needs to add goals to his game

Keeping things moving: Herrara should be a great addition in the engine room of Manchester United's midfield

No 3: Bafetimbi Gomis

A replacement for Wilfried Bony or will they play together at Swansea?

They have looked the part in pre-season. Both are powerful and Gomis will score goals.

I’ve liked the Frenchman for a long time and as he was free he’s an absolute bargain when you see clubs like West Ham scratching around for a forward.

No 4: Raheem Sterling 

I expect this brilliant kid to be another player Real Madrid will be chasing in a year or two.

He is an explosive little powerhouse, a mighty mouse of an attacking player who is as strong as an ox.

I am told he has returned to training at Liverpool looking hungry and sharp and that he is bulking up.

No World Cup fatigue for him.

We are used to a winger being easy to bully but it looks as if defenders will hurt themselves trying to kick this 19-year-old.

Liverpool will have to change the way they play after losing Luis Suarez and so Sterling could be used behind Daniel Sturridge or playing either right or left of him.

One of his many qualities is that you just cannot predict where he will be playing when the Liverpool teamsheet arrives, which gives Brendan Rodgers the valuable element of surprise.

He draws penalties and free kicks because he gets in and around defenders, under their arms and is great at protecting the ball.

Sterling is lightning quick, too, but needs to score more goals. The challenge will be for him to hit double figures as he continues his rapid rise.

Powerful: Raheem Sterling packs a punch despite his diminutive 5ft 7in stature

Trickery: Sterling's wizardry with the ball is jaw-dropping at times, but he must score more goals

No 5: James Ward-Prowse

There is a lot of doom and gloom around Southampton because of the exodus of so many players, including captain Adam Lallana.

But having such big boots to fill presents a real chance for this lad to shine.

This Portsmouth-born 19-year-old is a set-piece wizard and an all-action midfielder who I can see breaking into the senior England set-up before the end of the season.

He’s got an engine, gets around the pitch and starts the season after a successful summer tournament in Toulon for England’s U20 team. 

His free kick against Brazil was named goal of the tournament and he was voted the event’s third best player.

I am expecting a lot from him.

Steely determination: James Ward-Prowse has the opportunity to make a real name for himself at Saints

Bright, bright future: Ward-Prowse is a dead-ball expert and could be on the path for a full-England call-up

No 6: Diego Costa

My sources from the Chelsea training ground are raving about this powerhouse centre forward and how he is gearing up for the new season.

It sounds like he was born to be a Jose Mourinho player.

He looks like a Bond villain, he is aggressive and will use every trick in the book to gain an advantage.

Watch him wrestling with defenders in the area, pulling and scratching and diving to win penalties. Jose will love him, defenders will hate playing against him!

He is a finisher — and I fancy him to settle quickly and score plenty. He is a strong boy who will fit into Chelsea’s preferred system of playing one up.

On the scoresheet: Diego Costa will add muscle - and goals - to Chelsea's front line=

All-action: Costa can be aggressive and will do anything to gain an advantage

No 7: Rio Ferdinand 

My dad, Harry Redknapp, rang me to say: ‘I’ve got a chance of signing Rio Ferdinand for QPR’.

I like Rio, and loved him as a player but I was uncertain. After his illustrious Manchester United career, I expected him to glide off into the TV studio or to chase other business interests.

Dad said: ‘I’ve looked him in the eyes and he wants to play.’

He hasn’t gone for the money, that’s for sure, as he is not the highest paid player at QPR, but he’s in this list because I’m excited to see how it works out for him.

He will be defending differently from his time at United and he has put himself under pressure with this move but he looks in excellent shape in preseason.

The small pitch at QPR might help him and having Steven Caulker next to him certainly will.

Moving on: Rio Ferdinand opted to play for QPR rather than retire into the sunset

Key signing: Ferdinand adds a wealth of experience to QPR and could be all set for a swansong

No 8: Danny Ings 

The Burnley striker is raw but he has lots of ability.

Now we’ll see if he can he handle the step up from the Championship, where he scored 27 goals in 64 starts.

Ings has also made his mark with the England U21 team with two in four games and was the Championship Player of the Season.

He won’t get as many chances in the top flight but he is a strong spearhead for Sean Dyche’s team.

I’m also convinced that Ings and Kieran Trippier, Burnley’s very talented right back, can make the breakthrough with England.

They are bright young talents ready to step up.

Step up: Danny Ings is in the Premier League on the back of an impressive scoring record in the Championship

Rising star: Ings has also made a name for himself on the international scene with England U21s

No 9: Romelu Lukaku 

The £28million Everton paid for a player Jose Mourinho doesn’t fancy is huge, especially considering Belgium left him on the bench as an impact substitute for much of the World Cup.

There are times when Lukaku looks like the next Didier Drogba with his brutal power and then there are moments when he looks as if he couldn’t trap a bag of cement.

He still has a bit to prove and he needs to repay the faith shown in him by Roberto Martinez and Bill Kenwright.

He’s no longer a loan player doing someone a favour, as he was at West Bromwich and Everton in the past two seasons.

At the very least he must match his return of 15 goals last season.

Staying put: Romelu Lukaku penned a deal with Everton after a successful loan spell last season

Fans' favourite: The Everton faithful will have been delighted with Lukaku's signing and the statement it makes

No 10: Erik Lamela 

You may consider him an odd choice, but the Spurs player who endured a terrible opening season in English football, is a wonderful talent.

I am told he is looking sharp in training and, while there is a lot of competition on the right side for Spurs — Andros Townsend and Aaron Lennon are also competing for a place — he could get the nod or feature through the middle.

He cost £30m and you have to ask how Franco Baldini, Spurs’ director of football, believed him to be worth that. But with a fellow Argentine as his new manager, we could see him emerge.

Second season syndrome: Erik Lamela has looked sharp in pre-season and hopes are high 

Price tag: Lamela joined from Roma for £30m last season after being the top scorer in Serie A
