All that floating about on their backs, you’d think otters have it easy.

But this little chap looks like he’s having a pretty bad day.

With his paws clenched to his ears he seems to be letting out a yell – not unlike the subject of Edvard Munch’s Scream painting.

In his own world: Photographer Doug Perrine, 60, said the otter would have been grooming itself in these sweet pictures

The sea otter was photographed as he 
swam around an Alaskan harbour on his back, just a fish’s throw away 
from diners at nearby restaurants.

Doug Perrine, 60, who took the 
pictures, said: ‘It is a wild otter but it was not afraid of people who 
were watching from the dock only a metre or two away.

'It gathered mussels and was feeding between the boats.’

Of course, the animal’s apparent yell
of anguish might not be  that at all. Experts suggest otters move their
paws over their ears and head as part of a grooming ritual.

The Scream was painted by Norwegian 
Expressionist Munch between 1893 and 1910. One version sold at auction 
in May for £75million.

Lunchtime Munch: Mr Perrine says that when the otter's hands are near its mouth, it is likely to be feeding

Mr Perrine, from Hawaii, added: 'The otter was floating on its back, initially sleeping, and afterwards feeding.

'The hand movements are feeding - when the hands or paws are in the mouth - and grooming, when the hands are on the ears or other parts of the head.

'The otter was very close to the dock, so I was able to get sharp, high-quality images.

'This was a unique opportunity, as most otters in this part of Alaska are very shy and wary, as they are still hunted and shot as pests.'
