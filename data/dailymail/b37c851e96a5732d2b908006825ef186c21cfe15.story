The creator of Teletubbies has warned that home-grown children’s television programming is in terminal decline.

Anne Wood said the industry has been ‘struggling for many, many years’ despite more channels being launched.

Since Teletubbies was first broadcast 18 years ago, the amount of new children’s programmes has dropped dramatically. In 1998, repeats made up  38 per cent of children’s programmes – by 2011, the figure was 91 per cent, according to Ofcom.

Pact, the industry body for independent TV producers, recently called for a tax break for children’s programmes to boost British commissions. 

Blaming budget cutbacks, Miss Wood told BBC Radio 4 that one of the reasons for fewer programmes was because ‘the number of people who commission have disappeared’.

It comes after the head of TV regulator Ofcom said earlier this month that children’s TV is ‘not as good as it would ideally be’.

Some argue that the ban on junk food advertising has decreased the revenue available to commercial broadcasters - but the BBC is also forecast to cut its spending.

Chief executive John McKay said: ‘Our children’s television production is respected worldwide and we hope that ministers will agree that this is a special part of cultural heritage that is worth government’s support.’

Pact says a tax relief scheme would boost co-production opportunities, particularly with the US market, and would improve exports of home-grown shows.

The body claims that only one in five of all children’s programmes aired on British TV is made in the UK.

But Miss Wood said tax breaks are only part of the solution and called for a fundamental re-examination of the market.

She said: ‘The health of the sector requires there to be more places where you can be properly commissioned - so if one channel doesn’t take your work, you have at least got somewhere else to go with it because children are not getting diversity’.
