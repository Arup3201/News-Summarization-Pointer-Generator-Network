Parts of Britain were today blasted with 60mph winds and lashed with heavy rain yet homeowners in other areas have been warned that a hosepipe ban could be on the way.

As the storm hit Devon and Cornwall, the Met Office said other parts of the country have been as dry as northern Africa in the first half of the autumn.

Just a quarter of an inch of rain - 
0.6mm - fell in some areas which is the same as Marrakesh up until October 19. There was 
four times as much in Algiers.

Weather warning: This Met Office map issued for today shows the areas where the rain is expected to fall. Those living in the yellow area need to 'be aware' and in the orange area - where it is expected to be heaviest - need to 'be prepared'

The divisions in the United Kingdon are such that, over the same period, the Highlands have been hit with 810mm of rainfall compared with 22mm on the Isle of Wight.

It has been so dry this year that 
Severn Trent in Staffordshire has warned that it cannot rule out a 
hosepipe ban next year - with reservoirs at just 50 per cent capacity.

A warm start to the month - with temperatures hitting 30C on October 1 - has been a disaster for farmers.

Water resource manager Marcus O'Kane 
said: 'Unless we get sufficient rainfall over the autumn and winter, we 
will not be able to rule out the possibility of usage restrictions next 
year.'

After weeks of dry weather, 
firefighters faced a wall of flames as they tackled a huge gorse blaze 
on the Cumbrian island of Walney. 10,000 square metres of grassland were
burnt in the fire.

But with the winter months beginning to move in, a severe weather warning was issued for Devon, Cornwall and west Wales.

Just as millions of children begin their half-term holiday, the storm was slowly spreading across the country with four inches expected to hit in west Wales.

The cause of the sudden change is a 
low-pressure system that is heading north from near Spain. Gusts 
exceeding 60mph will add to the misery.

Today heavy rain was threatening to cause 
localised flooding in parts of Devon and Cornwall.

Torbay seafront
in south Devon was closed and drivers were being warned about tricky 
conditions after a long period of dry weather.

Four teenage boys had to be rescued in 
choppy conditions after their rigid inflatable boat capsized at the 
mouth of the River Exe in Exmouth, Devon.

A spokesman for the coastguard
said: 'The force seven winds and rough seas meant that it was a 
difficult rescue for the inshore lifeboat, and so it was inadvisable 
conditions to take a boat out for people of any boating capability.'

Cornwall and Devon will be worst affected
with up to four inches of rain in a day, around the amount they 
normally receive for the whole of October.

Low pressure: A weather system heading from Spain will cause more strong winds and heavy seas, like these in Lyme Regis yesterday

Met Office forecaster Tom Morgan 
said: ‘It’s going to be pretty unsettled over the next couple of days. 
Even if you escape rain on Monday you probably won’t escape it on 
Tuesday.

‘The other thing is the wind will be 
pretty strong in all places on Monday with a risk of gales towards the 
south and west, particularly on the coasts.’

A severe weather warning has been 
issued for most of the West Country and Wales, meaning there is the 
chance of localised flooding and disruption to public transport.

The West Midlands, London and the 
South-East are also being urged to prepare for the possibility of severe
weather. Almost an inch of rain is expected in the South-East.

A warning on the Met Office website said: 'Periods of heavy rain, 
accompanied at times by strong winds, will affect parts of western 
Britain during Monday.

'The public should be aware that 
quantities of rain may be sufficient in a few places to disrupt travel 
and give rise to localised flooding. In Northern Ireland the heaviest 
rain is expected to arrive later in the day.'

The rainy weather is expected to move
further north tomorrow, and warnings are in place for people in 
southern Scotland to be aware of the conditions.

Although
parts of the country will enjoy sunshine and clear skies today, by this
evening sodden conditions will have reached the east coast, with 
thunderstorms in places.

The wet weather should continue throughout tomorrow and last until Wednesday afternoon.
