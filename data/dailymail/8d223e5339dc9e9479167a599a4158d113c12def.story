A girlfriend claimed that she set her boyfriend on fire after participating in an 'alcohol challenge' which went wrong.

Marcos Fuentes suffered burns to twenty percent of his body early Sunday morning in the Bradenton home he shares with Necole Stephens, 35.

Stephens insisted Fuentes 'was participating in the 'alcohol challenge' and things went awry,' according to police.

The 'fire challenge' is a dangerous online trend which sees people setting themselves on fire by putting a flammable liquid alcohol on part of their body and setting it alight. 

Stephens told police that she left the home because she was 'scared,' after the challenge went 'awry.'

But her boyfriend insisted  it was down to jealousy because he was texting on his phone.

As he was being loaded into an emergency medical helicopter, he told Manatee County Sheriff's Officer deputies that Stephens 'threw 'medical' alcohol all over him before igniting his clothes on fire with a lighter.'

When detectives later contacted her Stephens declined repeated requests to return to the home and provide 'proof that she did nothing wrong.'

She was arrested and locked up in lieu of $15,000 on a felony aggravated assault charge.

Fuentes suffered second-degree burns 'on his left side from his shoulder down past his waist,' reported deputies.
