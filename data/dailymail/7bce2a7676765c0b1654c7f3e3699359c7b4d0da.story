Olympic star hockey player TJ Oshie and his fiancee Lauren Cosgrove became first time parents after Cosgrove gave birth to baby girl Lyla Grace on Monday.

St Louis Blues player Oshie was one of the stars of the Sochi Olympics, helping nab the men's hockey team a decent fourth-place in the tournament.

But Cosgrove had to cheer on her 'heartthrob' fiancee from back home in Missouri, since she was too pregnant to fly to Russia.

Thankfully, the excitement of the Olympic
 hockey tournament didn't send Cosgrove into a premature labor and she 
gave birth as scheduled at 9:57am on St Patrick's Day with Oshie by her 
side.

Daddy's little star: Oshie took off Monday night's game against Winnepeg so he could spend some quality time with his new daughter

Stayed at home: Cosgrove wasn't allowed to accompany her man to the Olympics because she was too pregnant

After labor, Cosgrove posted a picture of her new family on Twitter, writing: '1st day as parents! We love our little Lyla Grace.'

The new dad took off work that night, as the Blues faced off against Winnepeg. But he was back on the ice two days later to play the Chicago Blackhawks.

Cosgrove was still in the hospital when Oshie left for Chicago, and complained on Twitter that there wasn't ESPN to watch the game on.

That may have been in a blessing in disguise though, as St Louis lost out to Chicago 0-4.

As her soon-to-be-husband became a Sochi sensation, Cosgrove told reporters at home the tale of their romance.

'He's been a hearthrob for a while, here in St. Louis at least,' Cosgrove told KSDK.

The longtime couple met in North Dakota and Cosgrove moved to St Louis shortly after he joined the Blues.

He proposed to her on their 3-year anniversary, just before he left for Sochi, but a then 8-months pregnant Cosgrove had to stay home.

Hero: Despite barely making the team, TJ Oshie became a star of the Olympics after helping the men's hockey team advance past Russia in the tournament

'I might go into labor,' Cosgrove joked about watching the nail-biting Olympic matches.

Oshie emerged as one of the real stars of the games after helping the U.S.propel past Russia in the tournament - a remarkable feat considering he barely made the team.Â 

He was among the final selections for the U.S. roster and while he has never had a 20-goal NHL season, Oshie leads the Olympic team's American-born players with seven shootout goals this year.

Oshie scored four times in the shootout and put the winner between the Russian goalie's legs in the eighth round, leading the United States past Russia 3-2 in the thrilling revival of the classic Olympic hockey rivalry stretching back to the USA's 1980 Miracle on Ice win.

So, it may have been his small fish attitude less than his underdog status that made Oshie's game winning shoot out goal so unexpected.

Just ask Cosgrove what he said when he called her after the game.

'I hope this all blows over pretty quick,' Cosgrove recalls Oshie saying about the media frenzy currently encircling him.

'This isn't really him,' she said. 'He's so low key.'
