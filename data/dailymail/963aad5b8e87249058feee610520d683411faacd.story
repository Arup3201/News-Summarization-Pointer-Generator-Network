Eleven of the 14 hospital trusts investigated by Sir Bruce Keogh have been put into ‘special measures’ and hit squads will be sent in to help them improve care, Jeremy Hunt announced yesterday.

These experts may decide to sack chief executives and other top managers if they think they are not up to scratch – although officials will be handed a stay of execution to see if they can turn their hospitals around.

The 11 ‘mediocre’ NHS trusts in special measures are: North Cumbria; Northern Lincolnshire and Goole; Tameside; United Lincolnshire; Basildon and Thurrock, Essex; Burton, Staffordshire; East Lancashire; George Eliot, Nuneaton, Warwickshire; Sherwood Forest; Buckinghamshire; and Medway, Kent.

Victim: Terry Day, 35, pictured with fiancee Samantha Blythe, was mistaken for a drunk by hospital staff in Basildon, Essex, when in fact he had a fatal brain tumour

Three other trusts – based in Blackpool, Colchester and Dudley – will not be put into special measures and have been given the chance to improve care themselves.

Six of the 11 going into special measures are ‘foundation’ trusts – a coveted status brought in under Labour which was meant to reward the best-performing hospitals.

They are: Northern Lincolnshire and Goole, Tameside, Basildon and Thurrock, Burton, Sherwood Forest and Medway.

Sir Bruce said: ‘Mediocrity is simply not good enough and, based on the findings from this review I have set out an achievable ambition which will help these hospitals improve dramatically over the next two years.’ Mr Hunt said that 11 of the trusts would be put into ‘special measures’ for ‘fundamental breaches of care’.

He told MPs: ‘No statistics are perfect but mortality rates suggest that since 2005 thousands more people may have died that would normally be expected at the 14 trusts reviewed.’

BASILDON & THURROCK

Victims
included Terry Day, 35, who died after nurses ignored the fact that he 
had a brain tumour, instead believing he was just ‘a drunk’. Lucy 
Anderson, 30, lost her unborn baby after she was refused a scan because 
of a lack of staff. And disabled Tina Papalabropoulos, 23, died from 
pneumonia after doctors missed numerous chances to save her life.

The three trusts which had high death rates but which will not be placed in special measures are:

BLACKPOOL

Receptionists are deciding how swiftly patients are seen in A&E because of an extraordinary shortage of nurses, according to the report.

The administrative staff are making decisions which would normally be taken by taken by medical practitioners.

Ruth May, nurse director for NHS Midlands and East, said: ‘In some hospitals, in some ward areas, there was inadequate staffing – we heard from patients about call bells going off for longer periods than they should have been. I held the hand of a patient – just to comfort them – because the nurses did not have sufficient time to do that.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt made a statement about the damning report

‘I observed some aspects of care that did lack compassion. I would argue that we saw that at the same time as seeing poor levels of staffing.’

The report found nursing shortages at all 14 organisations – particularly at nights and weekends – with some nurses left on their own in charge of 15 patients.

Inspectors also found receptionists deciding how quickly patients are seen in A&E at Sherwood Forest Hospitals. Patients are told to tell staff on the front desk if they have chest pain otherwise they join the back of the queue.

The inspectors found a queue of eight patients waiting to be assessed by a secretary at the casualty unit at Princess Diana hospital in Grimsby, part of the United Lincolnshire and Goole NHS trust.

Earlier this year a major study found that patients are 10 per cent more likely to die if there are not enough nurses on wards as they are more likely to suffer complications.

Yet official figures show that the numbers of nurses in the NHS has increased by a third since 1997 – when Labour came to power – up from 261,000 to 350,000 today.

Healthcare experts and unions argue that more nurses are needed on the wards compared to several decades ago as higher numbers of patients in hospital are elderly and require dedicated care.

But the Royal College of Nursing is concerned that the Government has begun slashing nurses’ posts and claims that 6,000 have been lost since 2010.

Yesterday the RCN and Unison demanded that the NHS impose compulsory safe staffing levels with minimum numbers of nurses on each wards.

Dr Peter Carter, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘There’s an undeniable link between nurse staffing levels and patient mortality and we can’t keep failing to address this issue.’

1997: Labour wins the election and takes charge of an NHS budget of just over £33billion. At first, it sticks to Tory spending limits.

2000: Tony Blair goes on Breakfast with Frost to announce plans to increase NHS spending to bring it up to the European average, without warning Gordon Brown

2000: Alan Milburn’s NHS plan imposes targets to reduce waiting lists, later blamed for prompting managers to ignore care standards. He also says thousands more nurses will be trained

2001: Gordon Brown unveils five-year spending plan to bring the NHS budget up to European levels by 2008

2002: An independent review by ex-NatWest boss Derek Wanless calls for a huge increase in NHS spending. Brown responds with a 1p rise in National Insurance.

2003: But much of the money goes towards a top-down reorganisation of the NHS, such as the formation of foundation trusts and the replacement of health authorities with primary care trusts. Thousands more managers employed.

2004: Much of the extra money goes not to patients but towards extra pay for GPs and consultants, who see their pay soar at the same time as opting out of responsibility for out-of-hours care.

2006: Despite all the billions, a third of trusts face severe financial problems. Many are forced to close wards and cut staff

2007: First of a series of scandals as it emerges that 90 patients died from C. Diff at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells trust – because managers were obsessed with targets.

2009: Mid Staffs scandal emerges: up to 1,200 die on filthy and short-staffed wards. Health Secretary Andy Burnham orders an investigation but refuses to hold a full public inquiry.

2010: Labour loses the election, spending almost £100billion annually on the NHS – almost triple the level when it took over.
