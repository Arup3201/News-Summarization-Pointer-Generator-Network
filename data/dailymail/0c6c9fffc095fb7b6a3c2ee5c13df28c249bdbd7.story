Bill Nye the 'Science Guy' tried to convince Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn that global warming was real in a heated debate on Meet The Press Sunday.

Nye, who used to teach science to kids on his 1990s television program, argued that the scientific community was in agreement that man-made factors are accelerating climate change.

But Blackburn, a Republican who represents Tennessee, says there is no such consensus and that climate change is 'unproven'. And laws, Blackburn argued, shouldn't be based on 'unproven hypotheses'.

Blackburn said even if climate change was real, it wouldn't matter what the U.S. did about it since it wouldn't change the problem on a global level.

Nye tried to change the conversation to facts, holding up an iPad showing how much the Arctic Circle has shrunk in recent years.

'Once again, the congresswoman is trying to introduce doubt in the whole idea of climate change,' Nye said. 'What I would just encourage everybody to do is, let's back up and look at the facts.

'You are a leader. We need you to change things, not to deny what's happening,' Nye added.

Nye did seem to win the debate when host David Gregory stepped in and said states are beginning to feel the economic consequences of climate change, including the historic drought in California.

This isn't the first time that Nye has taken to being a voice in the scientific community.

He recently debated a creationist about evolution.

At the debate held at the Creation Museum inÂ  Petersburg, Kentucky, Nye argued that evolution should be universally taught in classrooms in order to keep the U.S. a leader in innovation.

'If we continue to eschew science....we are not going to move forward,' Nye said at the debate earlier this month. 'We will not embrace natural laws. We will not make discoveries. We will not invent and innovate and stay ahead.'
