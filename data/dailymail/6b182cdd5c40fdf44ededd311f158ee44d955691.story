League Two gets underway on Saturday August 9 with Portsmouth and Bury among the favourites to win the title if the likes of Jed Wallace and Kelvin Etuhu can perform to their potential.

But those two are not the only leading lights plying their trade in the fourth tier of English football, which has a greater talent pool than you may expect.

Sportsmail takes a look at the 10 players set to have the greatest influence this season... 

Jewel in the crown: Matt Grimes (R) is the best of a crop of young talent at Exeter

Matt Grimes (Exeter, 19, midfield) 

The leading light in a crop of talented youngsters currently in Paul Tisdale’s first-team squad.

Luke James (Hartlepool, 19, striker) 

Energetic young forward who has already made 94 first-team appearances. Scored 15 goals last season.

Curtis Nelson (Plymouth, 21, defender) 

The highly-rated centre back has stuck with Plymouth through their financial woes and is now club captain.

Daniel Bentley (Southend, 21, goalkeeper) 

One of the best young keepers in the country, Bentley has so far resisted the temptation to be a bench-warmer higher up the pyramid.

Safe hands: Southend stopper Daniel Bentley is one of the best keepers in the country

Matt Tubbs (AFC Wimbledon, 30, striker) 

Prolific in League Two with Crawley two years ago, Tubbs is back in the fourth tier on loan after struggling at Bournemouth.

Kelvin Etuhu (Bury, 26, winger) 

Made 10 Premier League appearances for Man City between 2007 and 2009 and has spent the last four season in the Championship.

Ben Purrington (Plymouth, 18, defender) 

The left back only turned 18 in May but is already a regular. Purrington is the nephew of English Rugby World Cup winner Richard Hill.

Feel the Power: Tranmere midfielder Max Power is set to star after moving down a division

Max Power (Tranmere, 21, midfielder) 

Full of energy and drive, as his name suggests. Has the skill set to dominate at this level after two years learning his trade in League One.

Jed Wallace (Portsmouth, 20, midfielder) 

Perhaps the one positive from Portsmouth’s demise is that academy products such as Wallace have been given a chance. Already has 13 league goals.

Brad Walker (Hartlepool, 18, midfielder) 

Like Luke James, Walker has come through Hartlepool’s academy to become a regular. They will do well to hang on to him.
