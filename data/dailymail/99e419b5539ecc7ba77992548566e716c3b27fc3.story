An Israeli helicopter strike in
Syria has killed six Hezbollah fighters,
including the son of group's late military leader, sources close to the organisation have said.

Israel has yet to make an official statement on the attack, but local media has quoted a military source as saying the
attack had targeted 'terrorists who intended to attack Israel'. 

The missile strike hit a Hezbollah convoy in in the
Syrian province of Quneitra, near the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights, reportedly killing Jihad Mughniyeh,  the son of late Hezbollah commander Imad Mughniyah.

Five others were killed in the attack, including Mohammed Issa, a senior commander responsible for Hezbollah operations in Syria and Iraq, sources say.

The strike comes three days after Hezbollah leader Sayyed
Hassan Nasrallah said he considered frequent Israeli strikes in
Syria as a major aggression, and that Syria and its allies had
the right to respond. 

Hezbollah has been fighting alongside
President Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria's nearly
four-year-old civil war.

The Hezbollah-run al-Manar news channel did not mention
Moughniyah but said Hezbollah had confirmed that a group of its
fighters were killed when they were checking an area in
Quneitra.

It said Hezbollah would announce the names of the dead later
on Sunday.

Quneitra has seen heavy fighting between forces loyal to
Assad and rebels including fighters linked to al Qaeda.

'An Israeli helicopter fired two missiles on Amal Farms in
Quneitra,' the Lebanese news channel said earlier, adding that
two reconnaissance planes had also been seen flying over the
area.

Israel has struck Syria several times since the start of the
war, mostly destroying weaponry such as missiles that Israeli
officials said were destined for Hezbollah, Israel's long-time
foe in neighbouring Lebanon.

Syria said last month that Israeli jets had bombed areas
near Damascus international airport and in the town of Dimas,
near the border with Lebanon.

Imad Moughniyah, who was on the United States' most wanted
list for attacks on Israeli and Western targets, was
assassinated in Damascus in 2008.
