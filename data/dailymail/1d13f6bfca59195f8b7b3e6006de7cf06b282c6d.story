David Miliband secretly plotted to hand Shaker Aamer to the Saudi Arabian authorities while leading his family to believe he was seeking to bring him back to the UK

David Miliband secretly plotted to hand Shaker Aamer to the hardline Saudi Arabian authorities while leading his British family to believe he was seeking to bring him back to the UK.

Documents obtained by the Daily Mail show the Labour government was involved in negotiations to transfer the father of four from Guantanamo to the Arab kingdom in spite of serious concerns he would face torture.

This was despite assurances that then foreign secretary Mr Miliband – the brother of current Labour leader Ed – was lobbying for his return to Britain. Mr Aamer’s lawyers claim the intention was to silence their client – who claims to have witnessed torture in the presence of a British security official.

He has been held without charge at the controversial naval facility in Cuba since 2002 on suspicion of being a terrorist with close links to Osama bin Laden, which he vehemently denies.

Although he has twice been cleared for release by the US, his detention has been extended as American officials insist he must go back to Saudi Arabia where he was born, rather than re-join his family in Britain.

Mr Aamer, who is legally resident in the UK, has repeatedly refused to be dumped in the Middle Eastern emirate. He fears he will be incarcerated in its brutal prison system, where ill-treatment is routine. As a terror suspect who had committed the criminal offence of marrying a foreign woman without permission, he would almost certainly be imprisoned there, his supporters say.

Mr Aamer, 46, from Wandsworth in South London, claims he was abused in Afghanistan by having his head smashed against a wall in the presence of a British MI6 officer known as ‘John’. He also says he has been beaten and deprived of sleep.

In public, the Foreign Office and Home Office assured the detainee’s 39-year-old British wife, Zinneera, that Mr Miliband and then home secretary Jacqui Smith were lobbying to have him returned to the UK.

In a letter dated August 2007, she was told the Cabinet ministers had requested the return to the UK of five terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, including her husband. By November that year, however, the FO informed her that talks with the US had broken down amid concerns Mr Aamer was a security risk.

It stated: ‘In light of the US position, we are no longer in active negotiations with regards to your husband’s transfer to the UK.’

But behind the scenes, government departments – including the FO, Cabinet Office, Home Office and intelligence and security services – were plotting with the US and the Saudis to have him handed to the authoritarian regime in Riyadh.

One heavily redacted note, summarising a visit by officials to the US in October 2007, drummed home the need to ‘arrange for a member of the London delegation to stay on in Washington to attend a trilateral discussion with Saudi colleagues on Aamer’. It added: ‘It would be helpful to have confirmation from the US of what had been agreed with the Saudis with respect to Aamer’s potential treatment on his return.’

Then a note from March 2008 revealed the Home Office had agreed to ‘draft a form of words for the Saudis to give assurance that the UK will not to seek to extradite Aamer if he goes to Saudi Arabia.’

It is the first time details have been revealed that show Britain was actively embroiled in plans to transfer Mr Aamer to Saudi, a country that regularly tortures prisoners. But it is not the first time that Mr Miliband has been in the spotlight over torture allegations.

He was forced to apologise to Parliament over the use of the British overseas territory of Diego Garcia for US extraordinary rendition flights and tried to suppress alleged MI6 collusion in the torture of another Guantanamo inmate, Binyam Mohamed.

But behind the scenes, government departments were plotting to have Aamer sent to Saudi Arabia

Last night Clive Stafford Smith, of human rights charity Reprieve, who represents Mr Aamer, said: ‘It is shocking to hear that Britain was stabbing Shaker Aamer in the back seven years ago and explains why the Americans made this unique effort to send him to Saudi Arabia.

‘The people who really did not want to see him back in Britain were the Blairites, including Mr Miliband, because they sanctioned the transfers to Guantanamo Bay where detainees were tortured.’

Andy Worthington, the co-ordinator of the We Stand With Shaker pressure group, said: ‘It is convenient for the US and UK to have Shaker somewhere he can’t talk – in Saudi Arabia.’ Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and married, securing leave to remain in Britain. In 2001 he was detained in Kabul after, his representatives claim, going to Afghanistan to carry out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity.

His supporters say he was captured by bounty hunters, handed to the US military for $5,000 and then tortured at a secret ‘black site’ prison – effectively a dungeon – at Bagram air force base. He was then sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002, where he remains.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Mr Aamer’s case is high priority for the UK Government and we continue to make clear to the US that we want him released and returned to the UK as a matter of urgency.

‘Any decision regarding Mr Aamer’s release ultimately remains in the hands of the US Government.’
