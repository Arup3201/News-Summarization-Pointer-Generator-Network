Holidays are coming! And with them comes the dreaded Christmas Five - the pounds the average woman gains over the festive season.

But apparently we no longer have to simply sit back (by a crackling fire, with an eggnog and mince pie in hand, of course) and watch this happen.

Glamour model Nicola McLean has staged a pre-emptive strike against Santa's bulge, treating herself to a round of liposuction to blast her muffin tops before Christmas.

Attack the bulge: Nicola McLean getting a non-invasive Lipoglaze treatment in London's Harley Street, in attempt to stave off the 5lbs she expects to gain over Christmas

The former I'm A Celebrity.... and Celebrity Big Brother contestant hopes to ensure that once 2013 rolls around she's already back to the size she is now.

Research shows that the average woman gails 5lb over the Christmas and New Year holiday thanks to an excess of brandy butter, potatoes roasted in goose fat, candy canes and alcohol.

But rather than waiting until January to shed that extra flab, stars worried about their figures - including Antony Costa of once-defunct boy band Blue, and former WAG Lizzie Cundy - are getting the lipo lasers out in November.

One Harley Street clinic has seen a 33 per cent rise in bookings for its non-invasive liposuction procedure in the run-up to Christmas.

The 32-year-old mother-of-two, who is married to Notts County footballer Tom Williams, had the Lipoglaze treatment on London's Harley Street at the LoveLite clinic.

She said: 'We all need a bit of help shifting those stubborn areas of fat - even if, like me, you eat well and exercise regularly.

'I decided to have the treatment now because I know with two hungry young boys and a footballer husband, there is going to be so much pigging out at Christmas.

'If I get working on my muffin tops now I’ll have a bit of a "get out of jail free" card and won't be so guilty if I put on a few pounds at Christmas.

'I know that if I do put on a few pounds  my muffin tops will only go back to the old shape because Lipoglaze has made them much smaller. I guess you could call it my little "insurance policy".'

Lipoglaze is a new technique which has 
become increasingly popular with both men and women who want a quick 
beauty fix but and don't want to go under the knife.

It can help stubborn areas like muffin tops and bingo wings in one 60-minute session by using a cyrongenic machine which works by first gently heating and then rapidly cooling the target area.

This causes the fat cells to crystallise and, as a result, fatty deposits are permanently destroyed. The body then naturally eliminates them as waste tissue over the next few weeks.

Donnamarie McBride, co-founder of LoveLite, said: 'We have found that November and December have become really busy periods.

'Lots of women know that they are going to put on a few pounds over Christmas and they want to take action now rather wait till the New Year. They know if they look fantastic before Christmas it is an incentive to go easy on the turkey and the pigs-in-blankets.'
