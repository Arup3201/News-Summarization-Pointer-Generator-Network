The family of a burglar killed when a garden fence broke his neck like a 'guillotine' have said he was a 'troubled and tormented soul'.

The body of Stephen Pope, 35, was found next to a pillow stuffed with goods taken from the house of an 89-year-old widow on Thursday.

The accident is understood to have happened moments after the man was confronted by widow Ilonka Simon, who spotted him in her back garden in Waltham Abbey, Essex.

A post mortem examination found he suffocated to death after his neck became trapped between a fence panel and a concrete sheet.

A witness reported seeing two accomplices holding up the wooden fence before it slipped and trapped the suspected thief.

Speaking out for the first time, Mr Pope's family said he was fighting against 'inner demons' that had tormented him, and he suffered from mental health problems.

They said: 'He had the ability to make you laugh and lift your heart, but unfortunately also the ability to break it into a thousand pieces.
