New footage has been released by the NTSB investigating the crash of an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 at San Francisco airport in July.

Video shows the plane as it hit the runway and flipped up into the air before somersaulting along the runway

Meanwhilst, the captain of the plane has confessed to investigators he felt stressed out and was 'very concerned' about attempting a manual visual approach because the runway's automatic warning systems were out of service due to construction.

Lee Kang Kuk, a 46-year-old pilot who was landing the big jet for his first time at San Francisco, stated 'it was very difficult to perform a visual approach with a heavy airplane.'

New perspective: The National Transportation Safety Board released a new video of the crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 in San Francisco this summer

Flipped: Filmed from an airport camera, it shows the Boeing 777 coming in for landing. The jet's tail strikes the ground, and the whole aircraft pitches up into the air

Deadly impact: Three people were killed and more than 180 injured in the accident, on July 6. At a hearing about the crash today, the NTSB released documents showing that the pilots knew their speed was too low as they approached the ground

The jet crash landed after approaching low and slow in an accident that left three dead and more than 150 injured.

The report was released at the start of a daylong National Transportation Safety Board hearing into the accident.

'In this hearing, we will learn about 
the facts of the crash, but we will also learn about the factors that 
enabled so many to walk away. We will focus not only on the human 
machine interface in highly automated aircraft, but also on emergency 
response,' said NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman, opening the hearing.

The
 trainee captain told investigators that he realized others had been 
landing at San Francisco without the glide slope indicator, a technology
 that helps pilots land at the airport. That system was out of service 
while the runway was expanded, and has since been restarted.

Interviews
 with the pilots who were in the cockpit indicated a nervous trainee 
captain, while the other two pilots recognized too late they were coming
 in too low and slow.

When asked if he was concerned about his ability to perform the visual approach, Lee said 'very concerned, yea.'

The plane struck a seawall just short of the runway, shearing off its tail and sending the rest of the airliner sliding and turning down the runway before breaking apart and catching fire

Korean contingent: Tae-hwan Cho, chairman of the Korean Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board, listens to testimony. The two-dozen witnesses at the hearing include representatives of Asiana, Boeing and the FAA and Korean representatives

A
 former Boeing 777 foreign captain at Asiana told investigators he found
 it 'extremely difficult' to get pilots to fly visual approaches, and 
that they usually wanted to take off rather than land. In clear weather,
 it's not unusual for pilots to make a visual approach, using the view 
through their windshield.

Experts carrying out the 
investigation into the Asiana Airlines jet incident want to know how the
 three seasoned pilots allowed a passenger jet with no apparent 
mechanical problems in near-perfect weather conditions to lose speed so 
dramatically that it was on the brink of stalling moments before the 
crash.

The pilot flying the plane was attempting to land without use of the autopilot. 

Normally,
 the pilot in the second seat is supposed to have his eyes on the 
plane's computer screens to monitor airspeed and other readings, rather 
than looking out the window.

In this case, that pilot was a training captain who was grading the performance of the pilot flying the plane. 

The
 training captain told investigators he thought the plane's autothrottle
 was maintaining engine power and thus speed, but discovered that wasn't
 the case just moments before the crash.

The
 autothrottle was 'armed,' or made ready for activation, investigators 
said in briefings after the accident, but they left open the question 
whether it was engaged and in idle or another mode.

Aircraft systems can have many modes, or settings, and perform quite differently depending upon the mode.

San
 Francisco Fire Department Assistant Deputy Chief Dale Carnes is also 
scheduled to talk at the hearing about how a fire truck racing toward 
the burning plane ran over a survivor on the tarmac.

Footage
 taken after the crash showed a fire truck running over 16-year-old Ye 
Meng Yuan while she was lying on the tarmac covered with fire-retardant 
foam. The San Mateo County coroner later ruled that she was killed by 
the truck.

Attorneys 
representing some of the more than 60 crash victims suing the airline 
and Boeing Co. plan to attend the hearing. Asiana Airlines is also 
offering $10,000 to each of the surviving passengers, a payout the 
airline says is not a settlement and does not prevent passengers from 
suing the airline.

The 
hearing was originally scheduled to run for two days, starting Tuesday, 
but it was postponed because of wintry weather in Washington, D.C. The 
crash was the first commercial airline crash in the U.S. since a crash 
near Buffalo, N.Y., in 2009.

Safety experts believe pilots are becoming so reliant on computer systems in today's airliners that on the rare occasions when something goes wrong they are unprepared to take control
