Vincent Kompany is out of Manchester City’s clash with Sunderland on Wednesday night and now faces a race against time to be fit for next week’s Champions League decider against Roma.

The news is a bitter blow for the Premier League champions with Yaya Toure already out of the trip to Italy and David Silva a major doubt.

Kompany ended Sunday’s win over Southampton complaining of discomfort in his hamstring and City yesterday confirmed that their influential captain will miss tonight’s trip to the Stadium of Light and the home game against Everton on Saturday.

The Belgium defender was sent for more scans yesterday to determine if he will have a chance of playing in the final Group E tie a week today. With Toure suspended after his red card against CSKA Moscow and Silva having missed the last six games with a knee injury, City could go into their biggest game of the season without three of their biggest stars.

‘Vincent Kompany is not able to play against Sunderland or Everton,’ said manager Manuel Pellegrini, who is still without Edin Dzeko and Aleksandar Kolarov. ‘We’ll see if he makes it against Roma. That will depend on the opinion of the doctor.

‘It depends what degree of muscle injury he has. It’s very difficult to know in this moment if he can play against Roma.

‘David Silva is improving, We’ll see on Thursday if he can be in the squad list for Everton but I’m not sure. I think it’s difficult.’ 

With Eliaquim Mangala banned tonight following his sending-off at Southampton and Matija Nastasic still not match fit, Kompany’s absence also hands Pellegrini a problem for the game at Sunderland, where City have lost 1-0 on their last four visits.

Dedryck Boyata, whose only two appearances this season have been in the Community Shield and Capital One Cup, or Bacary Sagna is set to partner Martin Demichelis in defence as City look to keep pace with Chelsea.

‘We have three options and we will see which two of them will play,’ said Pellegrini, who also insisted that the decision to keep Frank Lampard does not hinge on the outcome in Rome. 

Despite City’s poor record at the Stadium of Light, Samir Nasri is confident they can end the losing sequence there after three wins in a row in all competitions. 

Sunderland became the first team to shut Chelsea out on Saturday but Nasri is convinced that Sergio Aguero, the Premier League’s 12-goal top scorer, will find a way through.

‘In the past we have not had good experiences against Sunderland,’ said the Frenchman. ‘But up front we have someone who is flying and he can help us unlock any defence in the world. So we have to capitalise on that and hope he can make a difference.

‘We had a lack of confidence earlier in the season but everything is coming back.’

Meanwhile, Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole says City can expect the same treatment served to Chelsea when they bid to break down Sunderland.

Midfielder Cattermole set the tone for the Black Cats’ resistance during Saturday’s stalemate and warns the champions that Gus Poyet will employ the same tactics this evening.

‘If we can go with the same game-plan and repeat the performance we put in on Saturday then I’m sure we’ll come away with something,’ he said.

Poyet admits that he cannot explain Sunderland’s home hoodoo over City. ‘It is incredible,’ he said. ‘I don’t know how and I don’t know why. After what we did against Chelsea, we want to do something similar but with a goal.

‘We need to get a bit better and we will see what happens. I will take another 1-0. That would be perfect. City see an opportunity having closed the gap on Chelsea and they do not want to lose any more games. They will come here to win.’
