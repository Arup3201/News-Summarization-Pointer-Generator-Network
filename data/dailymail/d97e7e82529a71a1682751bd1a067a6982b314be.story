Leader: Warren Jeffs, left, smiles during his 2007 trial for coercing the marriage and rape of a 14-year-old follower to her 19-year-old cousin in 2001

Convicted pedophile and imprisoned FLDS leader Warren Jeffs continues to wield enormous power over two notorious polygamist towns on the Arizona and Utah border  he used to call home and that non-Mormon residents are spied on a new lawsuit alleges.

The Department of Justice has filed a civil-rights motion against Colorado City and Hildale, Utah, which claims that the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day, of which Jeffs is the president, runs both town's and not the elected leaders.

As part of the lawsuit, fawning letters sent by Colorado City Mayor George M. Allred to Jeffs, 57, were filed that claim to reveal how the shamed polygamous religious leader was asked for advice on who to appoint as new police chief for the town and is even assumed to have a supernatural ability to speak to God.

While the allegations of theocratic rule in Hildale and Colorado City are not new, the two letter's the Department of Justice claim to be from Allred offer up the most clear-cut evidence to date of how the lines between civil and religious authority are blurred in the polygamous heart-land.

Attorneys with the Department of Justice allege that members of the FLDS prevented a non-FLDS family in the twin-towns, which are collectively known as Short Creek, from getting water, engaged in questionable surveillance and kept some female members from 'escaping'.

The first letter sent by Allred is dated June 6th, 2012 and is covered with the instruction 'Private' over it and was delivered to the Louis C. Powledge Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice near Palestine, Texas where Jeff's is serving a sentence of life in prison plus 20 years, to be served consecutively, and a $10,000 fine for the sexual assault of one 12 and one 15-year-old girl.

Allred's letter begins with religious praise for Jeffs, 'As my spiritual leader I write to you today with joy and rejoicing in the Lord our God, even Jesus Christ.;

'It is my firm belief that you have all rights, power and ability to get the very word of God for all who desire it.'

Allred's alleged letter welcomes Jeff's suggestions on who should fill the recently retired post of chief of police as if he is in direct conversation with God.

'If the Lord had someone he would like to have in that position,' Allred writes according to the Salt Lake Tribune, 'it would be very helpful to get his sure word on who he desires to occupy that position.'

The Department Of Justice lawsuit which is scheduled to go to trial on January 28th next year also includes the action of plaintiffs Ronald and Jinjer Cooke, a non-FLDS couple who believe they were actively discriminated against along religious lines.

Court documents seen by the Salt Lake Tribune allege direct collusion between the church and the city which would contravene the constitutional separation of state and religion.

In a second letter sent by Allred to Jeffs, dated December 14th, the town's mayor asks for Jeff's opinion on changing the town's charter.

Indeed, in a bizarre request, Allred seeks the opinion of the convicted sex offender on the prospect of minting the town's own currency.

In a final aside, Allred seeks the approval of Jeff's in his handling of the twin city's civil disputes before going on to add, 'I am so grateful the Lord has chosen You (sic) as his mouthpiece to all the world.'

The letter's were intercepted by Department of Justice attorneys working with the Cooke's own legal team.

Surveillance: Ex-security members for the FLDS in Hildale and Colorado City allege that female members were stopped from 'escaping' the twin-towns

The worrying claims were matched by a declaration from Willie Jessop, who ran the FLDS security in the twin towns until he left the church in 2010 that he met with elected officials to 'convey to them the FLDS Church's view on the events' in the two twin-towns.

And in another unsettling development Jessop's junior Patrick Barlow has provided a statement to the Justice Department that claims the FLDS security apparatus had access to and would use surveillance cameras in the two towns.

'It is my understanding and belief that church elders and senior government officials knew of and authorized the linkage of the church surveillance system with the cities’ surveillance system," Barlow continues according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

'We could also broadcast church messages over the local fiber-optic network.'

Barlow also alleges that he spied on the Cookes for five years because they had become a 'threat to the church' and that the town's religious leaders wanted to prevent them from getting connected to the water supply and to drive them from the community.

Another serious allegation to emerge from the lawsuit is that church security would warn the community leaders when outside law enforcement were arriving and that they had instructions to stop female members of the FLDS from escaping.

'I am aware that church security was also used to keep the FLDS ladies from getting away from the community,' Barlow states in court documents.

However, Blake Hamilton, an attorney representing the towns is adamant that the letters will not be able to authenticate the letters because George M. Barlow, not George M. Allred, was the mayor of Colorado City at the time the letters were written.

However, the Attorney General's office in Arizona claims that the same man used both names.
