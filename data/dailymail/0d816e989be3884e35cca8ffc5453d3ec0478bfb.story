In a shocking case of animal cruelty, Jacob Vanderschoot cut his young Staffordshire terrier cross' throat with a boning knife and left it for dead in a western Sydney yard.

Vanderschoot, 22, attacked the dog in March 2013 in Bidwill, and in a joint prosecution between Animal Welfare League NSW and NSW police, he was convicted of animal cruelty under the Crimes Act and not the Prevention Cruelty to Animals Act.

Facing up to five years jail, on Thursday, and after 10 months of court proceedings, Vandershoot pleaded guilty to the horrific attack which left the 10-month old puppy fighting for life in Bidwill.

But despite his brutal crime, Vanderschoot was sentenced to just 12 months' intensive correction in the community for his attack on his dog Bouncer.

This will see Vanderschoot remain in community but under the supervision of Corrective Services NSW and subject to probation and parole conditions.

Magistrate Stephen Corry said while Vanderschoot 'caused severe injuries' to the dog and 'allowed it to suffer unnecessarily for hours with its throat cut,' he did not impose a jail sentence based on factors including a psychological report, Vanderschoot's age and previous good character.

Vanderschoot was charged with serious animal cruelty causing prolonged suffering, the most serious animal cruelty charge in NSW, after Bouncer was found by neighbours who rescued the near dead animal and took him to a local vet for urgent life-saving treatment.

Why?: Bouncer was left to suffer for hours after his owner cut his throat with a boning knife

Brutal: The cut on Bouncer's throat needed emergency surgery to save his life after he was left in the yard of his owner's home

The Animal Welfare League was notified by the vet due to the horrific injuries the animal sustained. Inspectors worked with police to find and prosecute Vanderschoot.

The league is a registered charity that has cared for surrendered, neglected and abandoned animals for more than 50 years and is authorised to investigate allegations of animal cruelty under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.

Animal Welfare League Inspector Damien Thiele said the attack was brutal and one of the worst cases of animal cruelty seen by inspectors.

'It was very disturbing - especially in that it wasn't something in the heat of the moment,' Thiele said.

Happy: Animal Welfare League Inspector Damien Thiele said Bouncer had spent a successful year learning how to be a normal dog again after his horrific attack

'He (Vanderschoot) had two goes at cutting his throat. He went and got a knife, he's taken the dog into bush area near his house, tried to cut the dog's throat, then he's taken it back to the premises and left it on his lawn.

'He tried cutting his throat once and then tried again. We don't know the gap, but there were two lacerations.

'It's disturbing how premeditated it was, he left the dog to suffer and the magistrate commented on that.'

Thiele said he was happy Vanderschoot had been sentenced, but the fact he had no previous convictions may have helped him escape jail time. 'Our focus was on bringing him before court,' he said. 'When we seized the dog at the vet he became evidence.'

After the attack the league took custody of Bouncer. For about a year, Bouncer has undergone intense rehabilitation with Animal Welfare League staff including behaviorist specialists and from external specialists.

On the mend: A foster home is being sought for the Staffordshire terrier cross who was just 10-months old when he had his throat viciously cut

On the back of his successful rehabilitation, a foster home is being sought for the dog. Until then he remains at the Ingleside shelter.

'We're focusing on getting him into the right home. The behaviorist said physically he's fine. He's not aggressive at all.

'He does like to jump fences so the person who takes him on weill need a high fence in place - it's about the right person for the dog.'

Bouncer was also used as the face of the organisation's call to action to help raise funds for victimised animals.
