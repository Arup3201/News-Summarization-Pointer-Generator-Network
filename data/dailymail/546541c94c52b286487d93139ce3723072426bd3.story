A Paterson, New Jersey boy is dead and another teen is recovering after a bull mastiff broke free from its home.

Paul Clarke's massive dog is accused of chasing down the boys, both aged 13-years-old, Friday afternoon and mauling them as they walked home from school. The victims remain unidentified.

The menacing dog named 'Trigger' was eventually 'put down' by an animal control officer, Passaic County Assistant Prosecutor Michael DeMarco told the Star-Ledger. DeMarco did not specify how the dog was put down. 

There appears to be no relationship between the victims and the dog's owner, who has been identified by prosecutors.

But a witness described the aftermath of the horrifying attack to the New York Post.

'The boy said, ‘I got bit by a dog and I can’t find my friend, we’re looking for him,' Maria Zachus said. 'Then I heard the guy say, ‘He’s here, he’s here! I found him!

'The father was screaming and crying, ‘My son, my son, my son — but why here, oh God why, why?’ Zachus continued.

Criminal charges have yet to be filed. 

Paterson resident Orlando Cepeda told reporters he and his wife were walking through the area at approximately 4 p.m. Friday when they saw a teenage boy who was bleeding heavily from his left hand.

'He said, 'a dog bit me,' Cepeda said. 'He was running. He was scared.'

A driveway on Sherwood Avenue was later discovered spattered with blood.

Neighbor Jose Hernandez reported witnessing flood lights, ambulances, and police that afternoon. He also saw bloodstained snow on the embankment of the Passaic River.

Paterson Detective Capt. Heriberto Rodriquez said further information about the attack would be released.

This is the second time in a month a New Jersey child has been injured by dog attack. Earlier in February, a Newark boy, age 10, was found critically injured after being left alone with two pitbulls in his father's apartment.

In that case, the boy was bitten several times and slashed before a neighbor broke down the door to rescue him.

His father, Enrique Carillo, 41, was charged with child endangerment.
