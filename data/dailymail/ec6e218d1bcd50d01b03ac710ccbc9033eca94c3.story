If you’ve piled on the pounds over the Christmas break, your belt might be feeling a little tight.

But in the very near future, that belt could adjust to accommodate all those extra inches automatically.

A smart prototype, called Belty, syncs wirelessly to an app to track steps, loosen and tighten as you move, and even warns you when you’re being lazy.

This connected belt, called Belty (pictured), monitors the wearers waistline measurements and warns them if they're putting on weight. It also automatically loosens when the wearer sits, and tightens when the wearer stands. The product is still under development but it should be on the market by the end of the year

The metal and plastic model was created by French firm Emiota and is on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

It syncs wirelessly to an app, which is used to input the wearer’s waistline measurement.

If the waistline begins to expand, the belt warns the user via this app that they're putting on weight.

The leather XOO Belt looks like a normal belt, but has a charger built into the buckle. 

It is held in place using magnets so it can be easily connected and disconnected.  

The belt, which comes in black and brown, can be charged up like an ordinary smartphone via a USB cable and has enough power to charge an iPhone 6 from scratch or 'pretty much any device' in around three hours.

The cable is concealed behind the leather part of the belt, which contains a flexible battery.

Belty automatically adjusts itself to be the perfect fit.

When sitting down, the belt expands to give the wearer more breathing space, and it automatically tightens when the wearer stands up again.

It does this by tracking tension on sensors fitted throughout the belt.

Belty will also warn wearers if they’ve been sat still for too long, giving them a nudge to get up and walk around.

The app can additionally be used to set maximum and minimum fittings, meaning it doesn’t become too tight, or too loose, when automatically adjusting.

Plus, if the wearer leaves their fitness tracker at home, the belt includes an accelerometer and gyroscope to record steps and exercise levels, which also syncs with the app.

It was created by Paris-based designers Bertrand Dupla and Carine Coulm.

The product is still under development but Mr Dupla said he hopes to have Belty on the market by the end of the year, with prices yet to be announced.
