For years she’s been seen as the main barrier to an Abba reunion.

Now Agnetha Faltskog has revealed that the Swedish group are considering reforming more than 30 years after their acrimonious split. 

The 63-year-old said they are thinking about marking the 40th anniversary of their first big hit Waterloo next year with a concert. 

‘Of course it’s something we’re thinking about,’ she told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.

Reunion? Agnetha Faltskog, left, was considered to be the main barrier to Abba getting back together. She formed the band with guitarist and songwriter Bjorn Ulvaeus, right, whom she later married

'Thinking about it':  The band fell apart in 1982, but band members including Anni-Frid Lyngstad, left, and Benny Andersson, shown right last year, could be ready to reunite, though he and Mr Ulvaeus previously vowed not to

‘There seem to be plans to do 
something to mark this anniversary in some way. But I can’t say at this 
point what will come of them.’ 

Miss
 Faltskog formed Abba in 1972 with guitarist and songwriter Bjorn 
Ulvaeus, then her husband, as well as Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid 
Lyngstad.

They shot to 
international fame when they won the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with 
Waterloo, before racking up a string of hits, selling more than 
380million records worldwide.

But as both marriages soured and ended in divorce, the band fell apart and eventually split in 1982.

Miss Faltskog retreated from public life and went to live on a small island near Stockholm, saying she had ‘overdosed on fame’.

She was most recently tempted out of retirement this year, releasing a solo album called A.

But the group has repeatedly turned down offers to reunite, including a $1billion deal in 2000.

And
 in 2008 Ulvaeus and Andersson vowed not to reform the group. At the 
time, Ulvaeus said: ‘We will never appear on stage again.

‘Money is not a factor and we would like people to remember us as we were - young, exuberant, full of energy and ambition.’

Earlier
 this year Miss Faltskog indicated she might change her mind, saying: 
‘Maybe a charity concert? I would not say no right away.’ 

Describing
 her Abba years, she said: ‘The more successful we were, the more 
pressure there was and our own expectations were rising with every 
triumph. There were so many negative things written about us, that we 
were not friends any more.’
