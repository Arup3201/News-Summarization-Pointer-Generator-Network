Could the George Clooney effect have influenced Britons' choice of a winter break this Christmas? 

Research has revealed that there has been an increase of 66 per cent in bookings for the Italian city, which hit the headlines this autumn when film star and director Clooney married Amal Alamuddin at the seven-star Aman Canal Grande Hotel.

However, the rise in bookings could in part be attributed to Venice's dedicated Christmas food market in the Campo Santo Stefano, with stalls offering creamy-white almond stuffed nougat, fruit-filled panettone from Verona and white truffles from Alba.

Andy Washington, Expedia.co.uk MD said: 'The Christmas period is always an extremely popular time for travel, with Brits getting away to visit traditional and non-traditional Christmas markets in the UK, as well as Europe for festive-filled breaks.

'With its central location Venice is a great starting point to discover the North East of Italy, whether exploring Prosecco country or aristocratic villas near Verona, Padoa and Vicenza, all within one hour distance by car.
