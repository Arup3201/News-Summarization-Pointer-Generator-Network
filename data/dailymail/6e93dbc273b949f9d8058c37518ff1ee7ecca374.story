A father of five who was facing a bitter divorce battle has been jailed for eight years after ramming a car into his matrimonial home, setting it on fire and declaring: ‘She's not having the house’.

Andrew McGarry, 37, who ploughed his car into his £120,000 end-terraced house, wanted to avoid estranged wife Heather, 27, getting the property after the breakdown of their six-year marriage.

CCTV captured the moment when the blue Vauxhall Zafira hatchback clattered into the front garden and then into the house in Bolton, Greater Manchester, last July before the vehicle burst into flames.

As onlookers looked in in horror McGarry got out of the blazing vehicle before saying: ‘I couldn't have hoped for it to go any better. She's not having the house.’

But he was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after it emerged his wife and the couple's three children were in fact inside the house at the time.

Their six-year-old son was in the front living room watching TV when the car ploughed into the house, but although the lounge window caught fire no-one was injured.

Mrs McGarry managed to usher the children out of the back door. At Bolton Crown Court, her husband admitted arson with the intent to endanger life and was jailed for eight years.

McGarry - who said he had intended to kill himself - carried out his kamikaze style motoring mission after leading a public campaign for better road safety in the area.

Earlier the court heard how the couple met in 2005 and they married the following year after the birth of the first of their three children, now aged six, four and two. McGarry already had two older children from a previous relationship.

But the marriage crumbled amid allegations of domestic violence and Mrs McGarry was granted a non-molestation order last June prohibiting her husband from contacting her.

The following month he breached it by driving near her house and getting an intermediary to take a letter to her. After being warned, McGarry snapped and at 7pm on July 24 last year, he ploughed the family Zafira into the house.

The court heard he had not 
checked whether anyone was inside the house before setting light to the 
passenger footwell of the car.

After
the fire, Mrs McGarry discovered a house insurance policy had been 
cancelled leaving her unable to fully repair the damage, which includes 
needing to replace the front window and rebuilding the garden wall.

McGarry
also admitted breaching a non-molestation order and was made subject of
an indefinite restraining order prohibiting him from having any contact
with his wife, their children or going near the house. She is now in 
the process of divorcing him.

Passing sentence, Judge Timothy Clayson 
told McGarry: ‘You were plainly deeply frustrated, angry and annoyed at 
the break-up of your marriage.

‘Your comments at the scene are a further indication of the fixation you had in seeking to inflict damage on your former wife.

‘It is clear to me you are someone with a very controlling, rigid, personality which results in your putting your own interests, feelings and desires ahead of those of others.’

'I couldn't have hoped for it to go any better. She's not having the house'

What Andrew McGarry said after crashing car into family home

McGarry, who runs his own design and architect firm, had campaigned for better road safety in his area after his daughter - then aged two - was knocked down by a car outside their home in September 2010.

She survived the impact and made a full recovery but McGarry collected a petition with more than 200 signatures and raised £500 towards a survey to examine better speed restrictions in the area.

As a result mobile speed checks were carried out on the busy road.

McGarry set up Facebook and Twitter pages for his firm based at the house but gave no inkling of any troubles at home - posting messages about his work designing loft and garage conversions.
