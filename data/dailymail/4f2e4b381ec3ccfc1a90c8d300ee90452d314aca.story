A recent survey has found that around half of people in Britain believe they would never worry about money again if they had £1 million - and a third would need just £500,000 for them to be happy.

A YouGov poll asked people to pick the amount they believed would allow them to be comfortably well off, with 29 per cent saying £500,000 or more, while 44 per cent thought £1 million of assets, not including their house, would set them up for life.

A further 62 per cent said they believe £2 million would rid them of all money worries for life.

Peter York, social commentator and co-founder of market research firm SRU told The Sunday Times that the ‘relatively low’ amounts shows the extent of regional disparities – as affluent people living in London and the South East might be surprised by the modest amounts.

£250,000 or less – 15%

 £250,000-£500,000 – 14%

£500,000 to £1 million – 15%

£1 million-£2 million – 18%

£2 million-£5 million – 14%

£5 million to £10 million – 6%

More than £10 million – 4%

Don’t know – 14%

He said: ‘In the nation at large a million is still magical, even if in London an Edwardian semi might be worth £2 million.’

That regional disparity has made headlines recently with vastly different properties hitting the market at the same price.

Newsham Grange, a Grade-II listed manor near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was built in 1705 and is set in 16-acre grounds and was put on the market for £1 million in September.

For the same price, last month potential buyers could snap up London's first ever £1 million council flat in Chelsea.

On the market for £999,950, the current owner stands to make a profit of £952,000 after the buying it for £48,000 under the 'right to buy' scheme.

The poll also found that of those surveyed, 32 per cent would continue to work even if they did receive the amount they thought would make them happy, while just 27 per cent said they would stop working.

The rest of those surveyed were undecided, at 11 per cent, or did not have a job, at 30 per cent.

Of the largest social grade group, ABC1, 20 per cent picked the amount of £1 million to £2 million as the amount they believe would guarantee a comfortable life.

More than half of the 1,941 people surveyed said they would buy property if they were given their dream amount of money – at 56 per cent.

A further 51 per cent said they would spend it on travel and holidays, while 49 per cent said they would invest.

However, it was not all sensible investment purchases – 16 per cent said they would spend the money on cars, yachts and private planes and 13 per cent on fine foods and wine.

Around 10 per cent said they would spend their money on private education.

A further nine per cent said they would spend the money on on jewellery, eight per cent on high fashion and five per cent on works of art.
