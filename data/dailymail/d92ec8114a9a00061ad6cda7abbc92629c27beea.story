He has been left without a buddy since the departure of his best friend Bryant Gumbel from the Today show.

And now NBC chiefs are keen to find Matt Lauer a new 'bromance' on the ailing breakfast show in a desperate bid to increase ratings.

They want to hark back to the chemistry Lauer, 54, found with Gumbel, 64, who left the show after 15 years as co-host in January 1997.

Ahead of the arrival of Today's new executives Alexandra Wallace and Don Nash next week, a source told MailOnline: 'If you look at Josh Elliott and Sam Champion on Good Morning America, they are really great friends and that shines through on air - not since Matt and Bryant have we seen chemistry like this on morning TV.'

There is no love lost between Lauer and Today's other senior male presenter Al Roker - who is close friends 
with Ann Curry.

Ann, 56, was unceremoniously axed in June after just a year as Today's co-host, a move that has been blamed on Lauer, who last night made a rare public appearance with his wife Annette at UNICEF's Snowflake Ball in Manhattan.

A senior TV source denied recent rumours that Lauer - who is on a staggering $25 million-a-year-deal - would be axed after Good Morning America took over Today's top spot in the ratings.

The source, close to the Today show, said: 'Matt is on a huge deal, he's hugely important to NBC - he's not going anywhere.'

Another source added: 'There is no chance in hell that Matt's getting fired.

'Of course, there are huge issues at Today and the big problem will be when the affiliates who pay all the money to air Today start complaining about ratings - they're never afraid to call a spade a spade.

'Every ratings point is worth millions in advertising revenue and Today knows it's not going to win its spot back overnight.

'We're waiting to see if Don Nash can do something bold. The consensus in the corridors at NBC is that Today desperately needs the right team.

'They need chemistry and the anchors need people to play with.

'Viewers like to see the presenters connecting, it's all about connectibility and there's no-one for Matt to banter with.'

'And when push comes to shove, viewers know nothing about Matt. Savannah Guthrie is super smart, but again, viewers know nothing about her.

'On GMA, people know that Sam's getting married, Josh talks all the time about his daughter, they're going through Robin Roberts' illness with her and Lara just doesn't stop talking!

'In effect, Today needs to find its 'secret sauce'.

NBC chiefs are already trying out new talent on air. Willie Geist has been moved to the 9am slot and is proving popular as a stand-in for Lauer, while other presenters are being trialled.

Viewership for Good Morning America is 
up three per cent so far this season, according to Nielsen ratings.

Today is down 
about 15 per cent. GMA has been averaging around 5.5 million viewers a show, while Today is averaging 5.3 million.

Earlier this month, NBC announced Today's long-time executive producer Jim Bell - a good friend of Lauer - was being replaced by veteran news executives to take over the troubled morning programme.

Nash, 47, a 23-year veteran of the show, is taking over as executive producer, and will be responsible for all four hours of Today.

He starts on Tuesday, and will report to Alexandra Wallace, who was promoted to the newly created role of executive in charge of the Today show.

Wallace, 47, will continue as executive producer of NBC's prime time news programme, Rock Center with Brian Williams, which is also struggling and faces the axe, according to TV insiders.

Bryant Gumbel, who co-hosted Today alongside Katie Couric, acknowledged that he is 'best friends' with Lauer as he spoke out following Ann Curry's departure.

He spoke out in Lauer's defence as he told the LA Times: 'I’m surprised and disappointed at this idea that Ann was a martyr, that she was thrown under the bus.

'I don’t know why she’s being portrayed as a modern-day Joan of Arc. In every job, in every walk of life, people are hired to do a job, and if they don't do it well they are relieved of that job.'

The outspoken star added: 'It’s a big-boy business, and when things don’t work out, people are asked to leave. It’s happened to me; it’s happened to almost everyone in this business,;

Gumbel said he doesn’t watch Today, in keeping with a practice he began during his own run between 1982 and 1997, adding: 'I’m not a TV watcher and I’m not a morning-show watcher.'

As for Savannah Guthrie, Gumbel added: 'Matt tells me she’s a good person, and I believe him.'
