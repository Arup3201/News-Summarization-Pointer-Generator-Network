While his older brother was mixing with the stars in New York's Times Square, Ed Miliband was deep in Ukip country seeing in the New Year with pub locals in Kent.

The brothers' lives now seem oceans apart as photographs that emerged on Twitter show David with his arm around top actor Patrick Stewart while a spectacled Labour leader Ed posed for a picture at Ukip leader Nigel Farage's local pub in Deal.

Former foreign secretary David moved to the US as chief executive of the International Rescue Committee after losing out on the Labour leadership to his brother.

Meanwhile Labour leader Ed – understood to be on holiday with friends in Kent - was pictured with Kings Head pub landlord Graham Stiles' son James on Wednesday afternoon.

Before going he posed with landlord's son James Stiles for a quick snap - wearing unfamiliar dark-framed glasses.  

A staff member from Platform 1 cafe at Deal station added: 'When Ed Miliband was told that Ukip leader Nigel Farage was a regular visitor at the Kings Head he laughed and said 'now you tell me!'

Mr Stiles added: 'We're just waiting for David Cameron and that other one to come in now, and we'll have the full set.'
