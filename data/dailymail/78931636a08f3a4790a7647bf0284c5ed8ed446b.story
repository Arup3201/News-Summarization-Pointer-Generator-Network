A hospital in Missouri is facing outraged calls to fire an OB-GYN doctor after she publicly posted deeply personal information about one of her patients onto Facebook last week.

Dr. Amy Dunbar, who works at St John's Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis, is under pressure after she initially complained about a patient who was chronically late for her appointments on the social networking site.

Dr. Dunbar asked her 470 friends on Facebook whether she should 'show up late for her delivery' after her patient was 'three hours late for her induction.' but went on to divulge in a further comment the patient had previously endured a still-born child.

Dr. Amy Dunbar is in hot water for her remarks which were re-posted by an unknown individual onto the main page of Mercy hospital's Facebook page

Although Dunbar didn't reveal the patient's name, the controversy erupted when someone posted a screenshot of the status and the comments to the hospital's 'Mercy Moms To Be' Facebook page.

Critics then flooded to the hospital's 
page and said that her discussion of any aspect 
of a patients history and case was inappropriate.

Dr. Amy Dunbar has not lost her job over the posting she made to Facebook but has received a severe warning from her hospital over the use of social media

However, the post does not reveal specific patient information, such as name and medical status, but does reveal the 
patient suffered the tragedy at some stage in her past.

'I hope immediate disciplinary action
 is taken against each of these individuals,' wrote Mands Glover on 
Mercy’s Moms-to-Be Facebook page.

'[Dunbar] should not be allowed to work with patients if she callously 
talks about them on her own Facebook page. While she does not name 
patients on her page she gives personal information about patients which
 could identify who she is talking about,' wrote Facebook user Heather 
Tiedemann.

Dr. Dunbar, 33, graduated the Medical College of Wisconsin in 2010 and has worked in St. Louis since.

Another
 poster on the wall disagreed with Glover, stating that 'The patient's 
name was never mentioned...there are still thousands of women that match
 that description.'

Kylie McConville, who wrote the 
article on pregnancy website TheBump.com that revealed the post, said, 
'The situation here is amplified because the patient is pregnant, and 
the doctor is the one responsible for delivering the baby (and let’s get
 real, there’s no way we’re okay with the delivering doctor showing up 
LATE to (the) baby’s birth).'

The full posting and replies by Dr. Amy Dunbar which mention the stillbirth are seen here in from the St Louis physicians Facebook page

Mercy has not fired Dunbar, but released the following statement:

'Our
 physician leadership has already called Dr. Dunbar. Her comments were 
definitely inappropriate. We are also reviewing them to determine if 
they violated privacy issues, etc.

'That process requires a more thorough review, but we will determine the appropriate response as quickly as possible. In the meantime, know that our physician organization holds its members to the highest standards and strives to improve our service and clinical care through that process.'

Regarding punishment, Mercy said its physician leadership has spoken to Dunbar.

This Facebook posting from Heather Tiedemann onto the Mercy Moms To be page expresses the outrage of some towards Dr. Dunbar

Dr. Dunbar works at St. John's Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis and made the Facebook post last week

'Mercy holds its physicians and other co-workers to high standards in ensuring the protection of patient information.

'We cannot comment on specific disciplinary actions, but we will use this as an opportunity to reinforce our standards through additional education of our physicians and co-workers, including appropriate use of social media.'

Dr. Manny Alvarez, the senior managing health editor of FoxNews.Com was unimpressed.

'The answer is not to get mad at the patient or to launder your frustrations in public,' said Alvarez, who is also the chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive Science at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey.

'As a doctor, our role is to heal the sick – but also educate them,' Alvarez said.

'One of the biggest challenges I have as an OB-GYN is to make my point on the significance of a good relationship between a pregnant woman and her obstetrician. This has to start very early in the relationship.'
