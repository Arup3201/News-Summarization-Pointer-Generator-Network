Double Olympic sprint champion Usain 
Bolt anchored Jamaica to victory in a blistering men's 4x100 metres 
final as they retained their title in a world record 36.84 seconds tonight.

The Jamaican will leave London a perfect 3 for 3 - three events, three victories - just the way he departed Beijing four years ago.

Almost even with the last U.S. runner when he got the baton for the anchor leg of the relay, Bolt steadily pulled away down the stretch, gritting his teeth and leaning at the line to cap his perfect Summer Games by leading Jamaica to the title.

The United States finished in 37.04 seconds, the old world-record time set by Bolt and the Jamaicans last year.

Trinidad & Tobago got the bronze medal when Canada was disqualified after finishing third.

The winning team was the same Jamaican
quartet of Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, Yohan Blake and Bolt that set 
the previous mark of 37.04 at the world championships in Daegu last 
year.

But the answer was 'No,' and Bolt handed it over while some nearby spectators booed.

About 40 minutes later, that same official approached Bolt and returned the stick.

Bolt responded with a bow of thanks and a chuckle, kissed the baton - and then asked his teammates to autograph it.

One more possession to help him 
remember his week at 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium, where any mention of 
Bolt's name drew raucous cheers, countless camera flashes and chants of 
'Usain!' or 'We want Bolt!'

'It's amazing. It's been wonderful,' Bolt said in an interview shown on the scoreboard.

Addressing the spectators, he said: 'You guys are wonderful. Thanks for the support. I love you guys.'

Bolt added the relay gold to the ones
he earned in the 100 in 9.63 seconds last Sunday - the second-fastest 
time in history - and the 200 in 19.32 on Thursday.

As Blake and Gay rounded the race's final curve, they were pretty much in sync, stride for stride.

But when that duo was done, the relay came down to Bolt vs. Bailey, who was fifth in the 100 meters in 9.88.

After transferring the baton from his 
left hand to his right, the 6-foot-5 Bolt churned up the track with his 
long-as-can-be strides, and Ryan Bailey had no chance to keep up.

'Wow,' Bailey said. 'He's a monster.'

After seeing the record time, Bolt began to celebrate, something he relishes as much as running, it seems.

He posed with Blake, each doing a signature pose. Bolt did his 'To the World' move, where he leans back and points to the sky.

The race was pretty much even when Bolt and Ryan Bailey received the baton for the homestretch, but Bolt pulled away to help Jamaica set the relay record for the third time since 2008

Blake curled his hands as if they were claws while making a scary face to match the nickname Bolt gave him, 'The Beast.'

After removing his spikes, Bolt 
danced barefoot to the Eurythmics' 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)' as 
it played on the arena's loudspeakers.

Later, wearing his latest gold medal,
Bolt waved his fingers toward the stands, trying to get fans to do the 
wave which they happily olbliged.

Usain Bolt, speaking to BBC One after
winning said: 'It is always a beautiful thing to end on 
this note. It is a wonderful feeling. It was a great Olympics and I am 
happy. I wish we could have gone faster but I guess we leave room for 
improvement.'

On whether he can replicate winning 
three golds again he admitted: 'It will be hard because Yohan Blake is coming up and
running well and I am sure there will be some other young cats coming 
through.'

Bolt paid his own tribute to Farah,

powering away from American Ryan Bailey on the final leg.

'I told him I was going to try it out,'Bolt said.

'It looks good on me, I might just take it.'

Talking of waving to the crowd Bolt said: 'It was a goodbye to London. I was just having fun with the crowd. I came here to London to become a legend, and I am a legend, and I wanted to thank them for supporting me.'

When questioned about a possible triple-triple track gold at the 2016 Olympics in Rio he said:'The possibility is there, but it's going to be very hard.'

'At the age of 30, it's going to be hard to do great things. For me, I'm just going to enjoy the moment.'Right now I'm like a bum. I have no goals.'

Ryan Bailey, who ran the last leg of the relay and got the baton at same time as Bolt commented: ''Wow. He's a monster. He's a monster.'
