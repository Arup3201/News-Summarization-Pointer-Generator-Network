A grieving father has written a heartbreaking letter to his seven-year-old son who was killed during last winter's floods.

Zane Gbangbola was overcome by fumes while he slept as floodwaters rose in the basement of his Surrey home during storms in February last year. 

His father Kye and mother Nicole Lawler were also taken ill as they ran generators to pump flood water out of their basement riverside property in Chertsey.

Zane died later in hospital from a cardiac arrest and Mr Gbangbola, a company director, was left paralysed from the waist down.

Surrey Police launched an investigation following the tragedy that occurred in the early hours of February 8 last year.

A pathologist concluded that Zane died as a result of carbon monoxide intoxication - but his parents have always maintained he was killed by hydrogen cyanide poisoning.

They believe the deadly gas, used by the Nazis during the Holocaust, was released through what they assert to be contaminated water from a former landfill site behind their home.

Blood tests on Ms Lawler, 37, and Mr Gbangbola, 48, showed traces of the substance in their systems.

But they say the pathologist was not told to test Zane's blood for the toxin, which disappears from the body within 48 hours.

In a letter addressed to his son, Mr Gbangbola outlines the daily struggle the family has faced over the past year.

'As I stare at your toys and the places where I used to see you play, my tears fall as my heart breaks from the emptiness,' he wrote.

'Mum cries herself to sleep every night. I dream of us together again and wake up happy, then sad because you're not there.

'I see your toothbrush, shoes and look for you. I can't hear you and I can't turn back the clock.

'Your warm hugs, kisses and smile, the sound of your little feet on the landing floor as you come for your morning snuggle with mum and dad, all now just loving memories.'

He added: 'I miss you so much Zane, from doing your hair and getting you ready to just being your proud dad.'

For the past year, the family, along with their campaign group Truth About Zane, has been battling for a more rigorous investigation into youngster's death.

Police seized a petrol-driven pump from inside the flooded property in Thameside, Surrey, at the time, and following their investigation, officers submitted a file to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for their formal advice.

However the investigation was dropped in December, with the CPS deciding there was no criminal case to answer.

Zane's family staged a protest outside the Environment Agency headquarters in Westminster in November to demand answers over the youngster's death.

Zane's parents Nicola Lawler and Kye Gbangbola, a company director, were also taken ill. Mr Gbangbola was left paralysed from the waist down, pictured right

They also handed in a petition signed by 16,000 people urging Environment Agency bosses to reveal what happened.

His parents claim the colourless gas hydrogen cyanide, which has in the past been linked to historic landfill sites, had permeated the floodwater from a former landfill site near their home.

They fear that others living near or on old landfill sites could also be at risk.

Mr Gbangbola wrote in his letter: 'I don't know what most think of your mum and I, but I do know what they would think if they lost their child, they would be devastated and want truth.

'So I ask their conscience to stand up for what is right and show solidarity with a parent in need.

'The authorities knew immediately what had happened, all they need to do is tell the truth. It makes it difficult asking children to tell the truth if certain adults can't.'

An inquest into Zane's death is expected to be held some time this year.
