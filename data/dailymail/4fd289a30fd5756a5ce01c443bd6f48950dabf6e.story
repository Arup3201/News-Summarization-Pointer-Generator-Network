He has become as well known for his brown curls as he has for his lady-loving ways.

But it seems Harry Styles is willing to sacrifice his looks for the sake of his art and allowed his hair to be messed with somewhat for the video of One Direction’s new single Best Song Ever.

In a teaser image released ahead of the video, the heartthrob looks unrecognisable with his new hair, big glasses and nerdy get up.

Who's that boy? Harry Styles looks unrecognisable in a still from video for Best Song Ever

Usual look: Harry usually has curly hair and is a sleek dresser

Looking a far cry from his usual cool and stylish self the 19-year-old is pulling an amusing wide grin while striking a pose in the picture captioned: ‘Who's this clever-looking guy...? Make sure you're back at 6pm for ‪#BestSongEverTrailer3‬…’

Wearing a pair of tight fitting trousers Harry completed his look with a knitted waistcoat, shirt and tie.

In fact the only aspect of his alter ego which easily identifies the pop star is his perfect white teeth, which are fully on display as he grins.

Let's dance: Liam Payne will appear as a choreographer called Leeroy in the video

Cool cat: Liam Payne usually appears in more typically masculine attire

Fans were treated to another teaser on Wednesday – Liam Payne in his getup – a tennis inspired look complete with blonde wig and pink headband.

Tweeting about his sporty ensemble the signer jokingly wrote: ‘gutted I left that headband on settttt.’

A brief trailer for the video reveals that Liam is in fact playing a camp choreographer called Leeroy, who appears to be based on Louie Spence.

Double take: Irish heartthrob Niall Horan looks the spit of business magnate Sir Alan Sugar in the music video for new single Best Song Ever

The usual look: How fans know and love One Direction star Niall Horan

Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson’s characters are the only ones from the band yet to be revealed

Earlier in the week images of  Niall Horan emerged in an Alan Sugar style getup created with rubber prosthetics, a false beard and a sober pin-stripe suit.

The fresh-faced teen looked old 
enough to be someone’s granddad by the time professional make-up artists
were done with him, and he wasted no time in getting down to business 
by roaring orders down a very eighties looking telephone.

Niall
even sported a receding hairline – hopefully not a sign of things to 
come – as he filmed the light-hearted scenes as an older man.

The images come as their track was leaked and found its way online on Wednesday.

Speaking about his frustration because they wanted the fans to all hear it together, Niall told Australia’s Nova live: ‘Because it was leaked, obviously it's a little bit frustrating as we were wanting the fans to hear it.’

The
forthcoming video will see all five band-members play different 
characters, with the finished product expected to be released on Monday.

Niall and the boys filmed the video between shows as their mammoth Take Me Home world tour – currently in the US – rolls from one continent to another.

With the final concert taking place in Melbourne this autumn, the band are in the midst of preparing for the release of a new album – expected to drop towards the end of the year.

The lead single from that will be Best Song Ever – a typically upbeat pop anthem that sees the band wisely stick to the formula that has won them fans all over the world. 

Their new track will be available to 
download on Sunday, but the band has already whetted the appetite by 
dropping a short preview clip online.

Busy year: One Direction will release their new single this weekend. An album will follow later in the year

The
imminent release will be the first in a number of significant dates for
expectant fans – not least forthcoming documentary film This is Us, 
directed by American Morgan Spurlock.

Speaking
to The Mirror, band-member Louis Tomlinson said the new film will be an
unscripted, warts and all account of their private and professional 
lives.

‘No, nothing at all was scripted,’ he said. ‘You know if we are asked the question, we just answer naturally. Because I think that’s the most important part, that we show who we are.

Uncle: Niall shared a picture of his new nephew after his brother's wife Denise gave birth

‘And you know, to do that we can’t have anything scripted. So it’s all reality.’

Meanwhile Niall has just become an uncle after his brother's wife Denise gave birth to a little boy.

Taking to Twitter to congratulate Greg, who married Denise four months ago, he shared a picture of himself carrying the little one, which he captioned: 'Congrats Greg and Denise! Wohoooo! I’ve got a nephew! Cutest kid ever!'

One Direction: This Is Us will go on general release in the UK on August 29.
