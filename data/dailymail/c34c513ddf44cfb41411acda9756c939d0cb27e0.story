Oldham's deal to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans is at an advanced stage and is set to be announced on Thursday.

Barring any last-minute issues, the former Sheffield United striker will join the League One club on a two-and-a-half-year deal.

The 26-year-old will earn a salary comparable with other Latics players - first-teamers at Boundary Park earn around £800 to £2,000 a week - as club officials want to make the deal 'as normal as possible'. It had previously been suggested that Evans would be paid £400 a week.

Contrary to reports, the father of Evans' fiancee, despite being heavily involved in the deal, will not subsidise the player's wages or cover any potential loss in sponsorship.

Oldham are pressing ahead to sign Evans, who has 13 caps for Wales, despite calls from major political figures and senior police officers as well as more than 60,000 people who signed an online petition.

On Wednesday, Oldham sponsor Verlin Rainwater Solutions severed its ties with the club due to the 'imminent signing of Ched Evans' having previously threatened to terminate any involvement with the club should the League One side go through with the move.

Craig Verling, a director of Verlin which sponsors a stand at Boundary Park, said in a statement: 'After receiving the news regarding the imminent signing of Ched Evans it is with great regret that Verlin Rainwater Solutions will no longer be associated with Oldham Athletic.

'We would like to take this opportunity to make clear that we feel that Mr Evans should be able to lead a life without further punishment after serving his sentence, although our feelings remain the same that this should not be within the public domain where his previous behaviour may influence the next generation.

'We sincerely wish the club a very successful future and have no regrets about being associated with Oldham Athletic over the past few seasons, but feel our continued support would be sending out the wrong message.

Pressure on Oldham came from prime minister David Cameron on Tuesday, whose official Westminster spokesman outlined his position on an issue that has divided football.

'His view hasn't changed (from) ... the time when there were reports around Sheffield United,' said the spokesman.

'Ultimately, it is for employers to take decisions, but the prime minister does think that footballers are role models and he is sure that any potential would-be clubs and employers will weigh their decisions very carefully.'  

At one stage on Tuesday a joint statement was being prepared by the Professional Footballers' Association in tandem with Evans, and according to sources might even have contained some words of contrition from the disgraced Welsh international striker.

That said, Evans will not want to jeopardise his appeal with the Criminal Cases Review Commission and PFA sources insisted a statement would not be issued after all.

On Monday shadow sports minister Clive Efford called on the Football Association to withdraw the player's registration should Oldham try to recruit him.

On the same day, Newcastle owner Mike Ashley held the key to Evans' future.

Oldham stalled on the former Sheffield United forward on Monday, stating that they would 'continue to have conversations with representative bodies such as the PFA' before making a decision.

But two club sponsors threatened to withdraw their backing if Oldham sign Evans – who was due to report for training on Monday but in the end did not show – and Ashley came under pressure to withdraw Sports Direct's sponsorship as well.

Evans was released from prison last October half way through a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman.

Since then, he has been rejected by Hartlepool and Tranmere.

Former club Sheffield United - for whom Evans scored 35 goals in 42 appearances in his final season at Bramall Lane - offered the striker a chance to train with them last November but they retracted the invitation after it caused uproar.
