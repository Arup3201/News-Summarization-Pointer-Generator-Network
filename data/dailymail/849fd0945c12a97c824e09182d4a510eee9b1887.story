Jaguar bosses told a motorist it was his own fault his £45,000 luxury car repeatedly broke down - because he wasn’t driving fast enough.

Jonathan Dines was astonished by to be told that it was his 'inappropriate' driving style that was responsible for a year of trouble with his dream car.

During that time, the saloon ground to a complete halt on three occasions, needed a week-long repair on another, and regularly went into a 'protective mode' when it he didn't drive above 30mph.

'Too slow': Jonathan Dines was told he is to blame for his £45,000 Jaguar XF Sport repeatedly breaking down - because he wasn't driving fast enough

A light warning that indicates a problem with the diesel particulate filter (DPF) has turned on 15 times since he bought the three-litre Jaguar XF Sport last November.

Jaguar blame the failures on a 'driving style issue'.

They say the DPF – which eliminates black exhaust fumes - becomes clogged up unless the car gets a good, fast run. Otherwise it can cause the vehicle to stop.

Mr Dines, 47, from Prestwich, Greater Manchester, works as an estate agent and says most of his journeys are short, within a few miles of his office.

He said: 'I was never told I had to drive in any particular way. You buy a prestige car and you expect to be able to drive it at whatever speed you want.

'As it happens I consider myself to be naturally a fast driver, and I’ve had points for speeding.

'You don’t imagine that a quality car would suffer from you going too slowly. I dreamed of owning a Jag but it’s not been a great experience.'

The father-of-three bought the car second-hand when it was just 18-months-old.

Now Manchester-based dealers Stratstone Jaguar have not only told him that problems are down to the way he’s driving the car, they’ve also said that further failures won’t be covered by the three-year warranty.

Mr Dines said: 'They’ve told me that the problem is that I’m driving too many short journeys and driving too slowly. I’ve driven a diesel before and the salesman knew I was an estate agent doing local, short journeys.

'They say I’m doing too much town driving.

'I think there’s a fault with the car. If I’d bought a Ferrari or a Lamborghini I would accept what they’re saying, but the car in question is a luxury saloon.'

Mechanics at Stratstone carried out tests on the DPF and sent the data to Jaguar.

Their response was: 'Looking at the average speed for both trip computers and the DTC’s stored in the vehicle, this is a driving style issue and will be chargeable to the owner.

'Please educate the customer on the driving cycles required to clean the filter reference the owner’s handbook.'

Mr Dines said he has been stung by the criticism of his driving style and feels the dealers have tried to wash their hands of him.

He is now considering legal action unless he gets a replacement car.

He said: 'They were very good when they wanted to sell me the car. At first they treated it as a genuine problem, but now they just don’t want to know.'

On one occasion the car failed when he was 200miles from home in London, forcing him to make an unplanned overnight stay.“The slower you drive, the less you clear the DPF,” said Mr Dines.  “The orange warning light comes on if the filter is full and after that it’ll go into protective mode.  On one occasion it did that after just two miles.  That light’ s come on 15 times altogether.“The car’s computer tells you what average speed you’ve been doing. They told me if I shouldn’t average below 15mph.

Since then I’ve been monitoring the computer and the warning light’s come on at 18mph.

Mr Stratstone said: 'We have a policy of not commenting on customer issues.'

Jaguar declined to comment.
