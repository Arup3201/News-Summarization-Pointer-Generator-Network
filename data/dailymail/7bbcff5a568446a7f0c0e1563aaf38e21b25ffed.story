He has been labelled as one of the most stylish men in the world, and has a string of designer collaborations under his belt. Now David Beckham is set to take on further global wardrobe domination by joining British fashion label Belstaff. 

The retired footballer has just been announced as the new face of luxury brand Belstaff’s 2014 advertising campaign. 

Shot on UK soil in Buckinghamshire the creative concept behind the shoot captures a ‘band of brothers traveling across the English countryside’ led by Beckham.

David, 38, can clearly be seen in the centre of the shot lying across a hay bale as poses naturally for the camera. 

The black and white portrait – captured by renowned German photographer Peter Lindbergh – shows off Beckham‘s modelesque physique. He still manages to look rugged enough to be a biker boy though as he frowns in to the camera surrounded by the rest of his biker gang which includes models Andreea Diacounu, Tom Firth, Christian Gajdus and Will Bowden.

The father-of-four looks casually fabulous in the label's classic leather jacket, a simple T-Shirt and biker trousers.

In the past Beckham has noted his love for riding bikes and it seems this dream has become a reality for the luxury campaign.

In September Beckham appeared at the Belstaff store opening in Bond Street where he commented how he loved ‘being able to work with a brand that has so much history and is very British’.

He said: ‘I began wearing a lot of Belstaff a few years back when I started riding bikes. I actually found my first [Belstaff jacket] when I was shopping in a vintage store, funnily enough, about six or seven years ago and I still wear that when I'm riding.’

Beckham has also famously modelled in the past for brands such as Armani and of course to promote his own underwear range for H&M.
