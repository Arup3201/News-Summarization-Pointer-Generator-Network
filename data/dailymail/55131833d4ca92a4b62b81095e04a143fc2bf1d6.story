Take a lift up to the 17th floor viewing platform of Riga’s towering Academy of Sciences, and you can see why this attractive old city is known as the capital, not of Latvia, but of 'Flatvia'.

Scan the horizon in every direction, and there is not so much as a hillock in sight. As far as the eye can see, there is nothing but straight roads, a wide river (the Daugava) and distant forests.

Mind you, there are plenty of vertical sights within the historic confines of Old Riga.

Coming into the light: Riga endured a tough 20th century, but has established itself in the 21st

Church spires here do not just soar, they slice into the sky.

Look straight ahead, and you see not just the bell tower of St Peter’s Church heading heavenwards, but that of the city’s cathedral, too. To your right, the domes of the Russian Orthodox Church shimmer in the sun like golden globes.

Meanwhile, down at ground level, there are pretty streets, uncrowded squares and, best of all, cake shops every 50 yards or so.

You can lose a whole morning, working your way though a plateload of pastries and apple turnovers. Sped on their way by a glass or two of balzams, a rooty-tasting dark liqueur (£1.50 a glass).

The biggest bonus of visiting Riga is that all the best bits are within walking distance.

Start at the castle, in the northernmost part of the old town, and it’s barely a mile to the southernmost point, in the four giant hangars that house the central market, or Centraltirgus.

These circular-roofed halls once housed factories in which zeppelins were made. Today the only sausage-shaped items on show are giant salamis and elongated pumpkins.

More than a stag party free-for-all: Riga revels in delightful cafe culture (left), and proffers wonderful historic architecture on the central plaza of Town Hall Square (right), where St Peter's Church is a major landmark

You can buy fur hats, religious icons, amber necklaces, jars of honey and loaves of all colours, shapes and sizes. Oh, and don’t forget the chocolate, either.

Much of this is made by a long-established company called Laima, whose history is intricately  interlaced with Latvia. So much so, that instead of agreeing to meet under the clock at Victoria Station, Rigans traditionally arrange to rendezvous beneath the landmark Laima clock, which has stood in the centre of town for the last 90 years.

And if chocolate provides Latvians with get-up-and-go, the thing that slows them down is beer - or alus, as it’s called.

There are two main types: one is yellow and lager-like, and called gaiss. The other is dark and stout-like and called tumss. There is no waiting for the sun to go down over the yardarm, either; mid-morning is a perfectly respectable time for your first half-litre.

No prizes, either, for spotting those locals who have over-alus-ed, and are finding it difficult to negotiate the cobblestones. Rather less discreet, are the UK stag and hen parties who are drawn to Riga, not so much for its historic ambience, as the fact that you can buy a pint of beer for 80p.

The bad news is that you might find yourself sharing a plane with them on the way out.

The good news, is that once you’re in Riga, you can spot them coming from a mile away (not to mention hear them), and slip off down some 17th century alleyway.

That’s not to say you won’t hear English spoken.

Not even close to the Caribbean: Riga sits close to lovely Baltic beaches which come alive in summer

Every shop, bar or restaurant has staff who speak fluent English; many Latvian schools and universities make a point of using textbooks in English, rather than Latvian or Russian.

You don’t have to look further than the sinister, crumbling building at No.61 Brivibas Street to understand the reason. For many years, this was the headquarters of the Russian KGB, where Latvians were incarcerated and interrogated.

Recently, the building has been opened up to the public, and as well as hearing recordings of people imprisoned there, you can visit the cells and even get a glimpse of the execution chamber.

There is no question that the 20th century did not go well for Latvia. With no hills to deter invaders, both the German Nazis and the Russian Communists took turns in terrorising the population.

That said, since Latvia won its independence from the Soviet Union, back in 1991, the 21st century is proving a lot more successful.

Riga has a beautiful, 20-mile stretch of golden sand at Jurmala, just a short distance from the city centre. Take one of the many trains from the Central Station, and within 40 minutes, you are no longer walking on pavement, but paddling barefoot in the Baltic.

Here, an altogether different Latvia is being created. Among the elegant old mansions and wooden cottages, shiny new apartments are being built just 50 yards from the beach (screened by trees).

What’s more, the Russians are back. Not this time as cruel and domineering rulers, but as buyers of the various properties that are being built at Jurmala.

Latvia may not have quite the same kind of year-round temperatures as Marbella. Nevertheless, with restaurant meals costing £15 a head, and a flight time from the UK of just two-and-a-half hours, the sun may at long last be emerging in this little corner of Eastern Europe.
