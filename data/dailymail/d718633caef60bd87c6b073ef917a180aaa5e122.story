A disgraced podiatrist has sold his oceanfront mansion under the hammer as two of his patients chase multi-million dollar compensation payouts.

Paul Bours and wife Helen are believed to have sold their four-bedroom home at Bronte in Sydney's east for several million dollars when it went to auction on February 20, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The exact price of the Hewlett Street home - which has private beach access, a heated pool and panoramic views of the ocean - has not been disclosed by real estate agents.

It comes as two patients chase million dollar compensation payouts after Dr Bours was found guilty of serious professional misconduct by the Health Care Complaints Commission in October.

Dr Paul Bours was found guilty of serious professional misconduct by the Health Care Complaints Commission in October 

Dr Bours is facing two lawsuits in the District and Supreme court from patients who visited him for routine procedures between 2009 and 2011.

The complaints commission took Dr Bours to the NSW Civil & Administrative Tribunal over his care and treatment of four patients. 

One patient, a 65-year-old woman, was told she could wear high heels to her daughter's wedding two months after surgery to remove a minor bunion on her left big toe.

But she still wasn't able to wear heels two years later due to severe swelling and pain.

The commission was told the woman claimed she thought she was only having surgery to her big toe given their conversations about it being a minor surgery.

Yet after suffering such severe pain, Dr Bours told the woman he had broken 20 bones in her foot to straighten her toes to give her the 'perfect foot'. 

The woman now has two different size feet, a badly distorted big toenail and she sees a psychiatrist every three months. 

A 24-year-old woman had a consultation with Dr Bours about toe fungus, but ended up agreeing to surgery to remove minor bunions. 

The commission heard Dr Bours showed the woman pictures of deformed feet as an indication of what could happen to her when she got older.

She now has problems walking, can no longer run distances and can't wear high heels.

A man who worked as a gardener told the commission he had surgery on his toes to relieve pressure on his joints.

His toe ended up being shorter as a result of the procedure - a fact he says he wasn't told prior to surgery.

The man also reported pins used to fuse his joints started to come out of the bone and into flesh by about half a centimetre after surgery.

The tribunal found Dr Bours failed to give a realistic view of risks and complications of surgeries to his patients. 

The property has a cutom builty kitchen and the living areas opens out to a lush garden with heated pool

The tri level is one of the only private residences with direct access to a garden path leading down to the Bronte Park and the beach
