A trio of brothers who grew breasts due to a rare genetic disorder are now 'living a normal life' after going under the knife.

The Ramírez brothers, from the Dominican Republic, said they were 'extremely happy' they were no longer being bullied, beaten and ridiculed for their 'moobs'.

Yeuri, 17, told local TV: 'It hurt a lot but now I feel good. Now they can't make fun of us anymore.'

Surgery: A trio of brothers went under the knife because they developed breasts due to a genetic condition

The plight of the siblings, which some have described as a hoax, was highlighted when their desperate father Felipe appealed for help, via the island's news programme Zona5, from specialists.

His work as a food stall seller, and the absence of the boys' mother who left when they were little, meant he did not have enough money to pay for an operation.

His emotional plea was picked up by medics at the Marcelino Velez Santana Hospital, whose boss Dr Pedro Antonio Delgado agreed to pay for the operations.

After tests to see if Yeuri, his 11-year-old brother Gabriel and 12-year-old Daniu could undergo treatment, they each went under the knife for two hours.

Rare: The condition affected the boys who are from the southern rural town of Magueyal

After the operation, for the condition called gynecomastia which affects males who have a hormonal imbalance, Dr Elbi Morla told the show: 'In reality, this is a key moment in their evolution.

'It was something that was affecting them greatly.'

And a grateful Felipe added: 'They are now normal men. They have had them taken off. I never had the hope that this would happen.

'I never had the money to do this. I'm so thankful to the press for helping.'

Doctors said they will now monitor the boys and give them medicine to block the female hormones they were producing.

And they revealed that the condition, affecting the boys from the southern rural town of Magueyal, was genetic.

It was most likely due to a hormonal anomaly passed on through generations of the area’s small congenital gene pool.
