The Hobbit is the most anticipated film trilogy for years and now one if its biggest fans - Prince Charles - will have special behind the scenes access on a trip to New Zealand next month.  

On his birthday the Prince of Wales will meet the blockbuster's director Peter Jackson as he puts his finishing touches to the first movie 'An Unexpected Journey' during the Royal's Diamond Jubilee tour of Australasia.

Charles will visit a leading workshop that created special effects for the much anticipated fantasy film - one of the highlights of the Prince's two-week tour with the Duchess of Cornwall to Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand in honour of the Queen's 60-year reign.

Royally excited: Prince Charles is a huge Tolkien fan and will be heading to the workshop of The Hobbit on his birthday to meet director Peter Jackson (right) and his team in New Zealand

The heir to the throne will meet the filmmaker on the day of his 64th birthday - November 14 - and be shown make-up props worn by actors including The Office star Martin Freeman, who plays Bilbo Baggins - the lead role in The Hobbit.

A royal aide said that in the workshop, based in the New Zealand capital Wellington, Charles would 'come face to face with rather extraordinary, rather terrifyingly in some cases, life-like prosthetics including the feet and hands of the Baggins family...'

'The Prince is a great fan of children’s literature and Tolkien is one of the great icons of children’s literature,' a royal source said, adding: 'He and the Duchess have seen Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films and the Prince has said he is very much looking forward to seeing Bilbo Baggins’s foot.'

Anticipated: The Hobbit, starring Britain's own Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is being released as a trilogy with the first installment out in the UK in December - pictured is an upcoming scene

Camilla will be making her first trip to the three countries, in a private or public capacity, while Charles, a seasoned traveller, has visited the southern hemisphere nations many times

The film receives its world premiere next month in New Zealand and the Prince will get a sneak preview of the movie - the first of a three-part instalment based on JRR Tolkien's much loved children's book.

The themes of the Jubilee visit include service to the community, encouragement of economic growth and innovation, promotion of youth enterprise, celebration of sport in the community and support for the Armed Forces.

Speaking about the first leg of the tour to Papua New Guinea which begins on November 3 the aide added: 'The visit is centred on the capital Port Moresby but also includes a visit to a nearby fishing village called Boera where a traditional and probably rather dramatic welcome is planned by the local inhabitants.'

Thrilling: The film will see the return of Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Prince Charles will learn all about how costumes, sets and prosthetics for the movie have been made

Story: The Hobbit, published in 1937, tells the journey of Bilbo, who goes on a quest to steal treasure guarded by a dragon - shown considering the task before him

Domestic violence is a serious issue in the country and Camilla will visit a women's refuge to highlight the topic during their three-day visit to the nation.

In Australia the royal couple have set themselves the task of visiting four major cities - Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney and the capital Canberra - the outback town of Longreach in Queensland and the island state of Tasmania in just six days from November 5-10.

The final leg to New Zealand, from November 10-16, will see the royal 
couple meet popular children's author Lynley Dodd, writer of the Hairy 
Maclary stories about the adventures of a hairy dog.

Trip: The Royal couple will visit Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand and will be Camilla's first official journey to the region

Charles shares his birthday with the Governor General Sir Jerry 
Mateparae, and Bronagh Key, wife of the Prime Minister John Key, and the
trio will celebrate their anniversaries with 64 specially chosen New 
Zealanders also born on the same day.

The final day takes the royal travellers to Christchurch to see how 
residents have rebuilt their lives after last year's devastating 
earthquake.

A royal aide said: 'The theme of the Jubilee, as you'll know, is service to others and their royal highnesses are determined to meet as many people possible in the time available which is why we're trying to get around so many states and territories as we possibly can.'
