A grandmother used her mother's taxpayer-funded mobility car as a getaway vehicle for a career burglar.

Rosemary Pollard used the Seat Leon, which was specially-adapted for her wheelchair-bound mother, to chauffeur career criminal Daryl Kennedy, 51, to 46 raids in villages across Cheshire.

The 58-year-old was paid £100 each time she drove Kennedy to a home, where she would wait outside before driving him away.

On Christmas Eve last year, Pollard drove Kennedy to 14 homes, where he forced PVC windows and back doors to steal jewellery, laptops, tablets, watches and cash while she waited in the car outside.

On another occasion she drove Kennedy to burgle the house of a family who were out visiting a dying relative in hospital.

Pollard, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, leased the Seat Leon using her mother's £60-a-week disability allowance.

She was arrested last January after a major investigation into the raids on a number of towns and villages.

She was jailed for three and a half years at Chester Crown Court after she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle.

Judge Elgan Edwards, told her: 'This case fills any right thinking person with disgust.

'You involved yourself in many, many burglaries, sometimes a number in different areas in one day.

'You knew precisely what you were doing, you knew what you were being paid for.

'It is an unsettling feature that you used your mother’s mobility vehicle on these expeditions. Prison is inevitable.

'The fact that someone could recruit willing volunteers to ferry him from Manchester to all parts of Cheshire in order to break into domestic houses is disgusting.'

Replacement: Pollard claimed she was only 'recruited as a volunteer' to transport Kennedy to the crime scenes after he  fell out with his two other drivers, Winston Bell, left, and Ajaz Ahmed, right, who were also jailed

Earlier, the court heard how Kennedy, nicknamed the 'Sydney Cat Burglar' due to a criminal past in Australia, was said to be the 'managing director’ of the crime gang which escaped with £250,000-worth of valuables over an eight-month period.

He masterminded his 'professional enterprise' from a bail hostel in Salford, Greater Manchester, and meticulously researched properties to ensure they were empty before breaking in - often during the day - between April and December last year.

He carried out 140 raids in total, including one in which an engagement ring was stolen from a couple just two weeks before their wedding day.

'It is a hallmark of Kennedy’s 
professionalism as a burglar that he targeted unoccupied dwellings 
during daylight hours, being careful to select houses where the 
occupants were at work or on holiday' - Prosecutor Simon Parry

He was said to have gambled away the proceeds of his crimes away. Pollard was one of three drivers used by Kennedy.

Victims were left living in fear as the professional criminal targeted multiple homes in the same street, breaking-into properties in villages close to the A556 main road while residents were at work, out shopping or on holiday.

Prosecutor Simon Parry said: 'As well as targeting specific areas, that they would often return to burgle again and again.

'It is a hallmark of Kennedy’s professionalism as a burglar that he targeted unoccupied dwellings during daylight hours, being careful to select houses where the occupants were at work or on holiday.'

Kennedy was caught on New Year’s Eve when a member of the public reported a black Audi parked suspiciously in Hale Barns, Greater Manchester. Officers found stolen cash, jewellery and laptops inside the vehicle.

Pollard claimed she was only 'recruited as a volunteer' to transport the burglar to the crime scenes, after Kennedy fell out with his two other drivers, Winston Bell and Ajaz Ahmed.

Her lawyer David Abbott said Pollard suffered from arthritis, carpel tunnel syndrome and depression and recently had a heart bypass.

Mr Abbott also said that Pollard was the main carer for her mother and helped her with everyday tasks in the bungalow they shared.

Sentence: Rosemary Pollard was jailed for three and a half years at Chester Crown Court, pictured after she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle. Kennedy was jailed for 10 years

He added: 'Kennedy didn’t actually tell her what he was intending. She accepts that she guessed and she turned a blind eye to it. She tells me she is disgusted with herself for having got involved in these matters.

Kennedy was jailed for 10 years at an earlier hearing after admitting conspiracy to burgle between April and December 2013.

Bell, 56, of Failsworth, Greater Manchester, was sentenced to four years, and Ahmed, 46, of Rochdale was sentenced to three years. Both pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to burgle.

Supt Paul Williams of Cheshire Police who led the investigation said: 'This is a great result for the victims of these burglaries, to know that the people responsible for violating their homes and their privacy and causing them distress are being held to account.'

'It should also be reassuring for the people of Cheshire to know that that they are no longer free to commit these crimes and cause distress to anyone else.

'These people were responsible for a dramatic increase in the number of burglaries in homes across Cheshire and it was our priority to put a stop to their activities.'
