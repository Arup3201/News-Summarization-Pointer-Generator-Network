We are often told that every snowflake is different - but the naked eye is simply not advanced enough to appreciate the world's favourite form of precipitation.

But even without a white Christmas this year, we are able to fully explore the complexity of the water molecules that make up snowflakes thanks to an American scientist and his fascination with the white stuff.

Kenneth Libbrecht, a Professor of Physics at the California Institute of Technology, has been studying snowflakes, ice patterns, crystal growth and ice formations since 1997.

Using a specially designed photo-microscope called the SnowMaster 9000, the 53-year-old braves subzero temperatures to catch falling snow flakes, photographing them before they melt.

Placing the snowflake underneath the microscope, he illuminates the snowflake with coloured lights. 

Unique: Professor Kenneth Libbrecht collects snowflakes in Northern Ontario, Alaska, Vermont, the Michigan Upper Peninsula and the Sierra Nevada mountains 

Fascination: Kenneth Libbrecht, Professor of Physics at the California Institute of Technology, has been studying snowflakes, ice patterns, crystal growth and ice formations since 1997

Sophisticated: The scientist photographs the flakes using a device called the SnowMaster 9000, a cross between a microscope and a camera

These pictures show real snow 
crystals that fell to earth in Northern Ontario, Alaska, Vermont, the 
Michigan Upper Peninsula and the Sierra Nevada mountains of California.

The
professor was first inspired to capture snowflakes after realising that
they had never been captured in a way that intrigued him.

He
said: 'When I first began toying with the idea of writing a book about 
snowflakes, I found that there weren't any really nice pictures out 
there.

'The state-of-the-art in snowflake photography was not what it could have been.

'This
was an opportunity, so I set out to design and build a photo-microscope
that was optimised for taking pictures of snowflakes.'

Mr Libbrecht soon found that he would have to overcome a number of challenges to acquire the images he desired.

'There
are a number of challenges in photographing snowflakes. The crystals 
are small, so the usual techniques of macro photography don't work well;
what you need is essentially a high-quality, low-power microscope.

Equipment: The Snowmaster 9000, built by Mr Libbrecht, features a microscope and a Nikon D1X camera within a heated enclosure

'In
addition, the equipment must be robust enough to work outside, and it 
has to withstand sub-freezing temperatures. Finally, to take good 
pictures, you have to take a lot of pictures. Therefore, I wanted my 
hardware to be easy to set up and use.'

Snow
flakes form when a cloud droplet first freezes into a tiny particle of 
ice. As water vapour starts condensing on its surface, the ice particle 
quickly develops facets, which form into different shaped snowflakes 
depending on temperature.

Whilst scientists differ on the classifications of snowflakes, the scientist has identified 35 different types of formations.

These
include Stellar Dentrites, plate-like snow crystals that have branches 
and sidebranches, which are typically 2-4 mm in diameter.

Stellar
Plates or 'common snowflakes' are thin, plate-like crystals with six 
broad arms that form a star-like shape, forming when the temperature is 
near -2 C (28 F) or near -15 C (5 F).

Others like Fernlike Stellar Dentrites are the largest snow crystals, often falling to earth with diameters of 5mm or more.

Building
the specially designed SnowMaster 9000, a microscope and Nikon D1X 
digital camera contained in a heated enclosure, Mr Libbrecht was able to
get the desired results.

Dedication: After studying snowflakes for 14 years the scientist has identified 35 different types of snowflake formation 

Colour: To
highlight the snowflake's dimensions and qualities, Mr Libbrecht uses 
illumination techniques from a variety of colour filters for different 
effects

'The
camera itself is housed in a heated enclosure, white styrofoam box, so 
that it can stay outside in the cold indefinitely,' he explains.

'The snowflake is placed on a platform attached to a translation stage for focusing.

'As
is typical for microscopes, it is more convenient to move the subject 
than to move the lens. I attached a flexible shaft and a large knob to 
the stage, making it easier to focus with cold fingers.'

To
highlight the snowflake's dimensions and qualities, Mr Libbrecht uses 
illumination techniques from a variety of colour filters for different 
effects.

'Snow crystals are
made of ice, which is clear and colourless. I like to illuminate the 
crystals with coloured lights from behind, using the optical layout 
shown above.

'The snow 
crystal then acts like a complex lens that refracts the different 
colours in different directions, producing a variety of colourful 
effects.

'To illuminate
the crystals, I use a lamp mounted below them. Above the lamp is a 
heat-rejection filter and a piece of ground glass and on top of those 
components I can place any of a number of colour filters. The field lens
focuses the colour filter onto the microscope objective.'

Kenneth's 
amazing images have allowed him to further his study of of crystal 
formations and apply them to a number of industries - particularly 
manufacturing.

Precision: He has to take lots of photographs before finding one that works effectively

Further use: As well as providing beautiful images, the scientist says his work helps understand the 'structure formation and 'self-assembly' qualities in snowflakes 

Unique: Speaking of each snowflake's distinction, he said: 'There is no
blueprint or genetic code that guides the growth of a snowflake'

'There are 
several good reasons for studying how snowflakes form. First of all, 
crystals are useful in all sorts of applications, and we would like to 
know how to grow them better. By studying the physics of snowflakes, we 
learn about how molecules condense to form crystals.

'Another
good reason to study snowflakes is to better understand structure 
formation and self-assembly. The snowflake is an very simple example of 
self-assembly.

'There is no
blueprint or genetic code that guides the growth of a snowflake, yet 
marvellously complex structures appear, quite literally out of thin air.

'As
we understand better how snowflakes form, we learn about self-assembly.
As the electronics industry pushes toward ever smaller devices, it is 
likely that self-assembly will play an increasingly important role in 
manufacturing.'

But the scientist says that his study of snowflakes is the pursuit of understanding basic science.

'My
personal motivation is not from potential practical applications. I am 
not trying to make better artificial snow, better ice for Olympic 
skating, bigger diamonds, faster computers, or anything like that,' he 
said.

'I want to figure
out the underlying physics of snowflake growth because this is an 
interesting puzzle in molecular dynamics. I would like to understand the
fundamental physics of how molecules jostle into place to form a 
crystal.

'How fast does 
this happen? How does it change with temperature? What happens if there 
are chemical impurities on the ice surface? These remarkable structures 
simply fall from the sky - we ought to understand how they are formed.'
