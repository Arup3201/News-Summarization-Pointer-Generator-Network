Amsterdam's today became the first city in the Netherlands to ban students from smoking marijuana at school.

The city's mayor Eberhard van der Laan introduced the law after school chiefs complained about pupils turning up to classes high after rolling up outside the grounds.

Marijuana is widely available in Holland as, although it is technically illegal, police can't prosecute people for possession of small amounts.

But it has also had the unwanted side effect that Dutch children are frequently exposed to the drug in public areas.

City spokeswoman Iris Reshef says schools have always forbidden pot, but found it difficult to enforce the policy when students smoked on or near campus and challenged administrators to do anything about it.

'It's not really what you have in mind as an educator, that children would be turning up for class stoned, or drunk either for that matter,' she said.

'But it has been a problem for some schools.'

After a change in national law, the city will now be able to declare as of January 1 'no toking zones' - areas like schools and playgrounds where weed-smoking is forbidden by law.

The move is closely paired with a decision by the new government to ditch plans for a national 'weed pass' that would have blocked tourists from buying marijuana.

That was a measure years in the making, and greatly desired by southern cities such as Maastricht that have been flooded with dealers from Belgium and Germany who drive across the border to buy weed in bulk.

Marijuana has been tolerated in Holland for decades, attracting many tourists who travel there to enjoy the drug

But the weed pass was opposed by Amsterdam, where drug tourists are not generally seen as causing many problems.

Last month, Van der Laan proclaimed that coffee shops would stay open for tourists after all.

In a letter Wednesday, he noted that one in three tourists who come to Amsterdam try marijuana while they're here, more than previously estimated.

After several decades of the tolerance policy, Dutch marijuana usage rates are in the middle of international norms, higher than those in neighboring Germany, but lower than those in France, Britain or the United States.
