Andrea Santon attacked the man after luring him back to her home in Lancaster following a night out

A 53-year-old woman who blindfolded her ex-husband before stabbing him in the back  has been jailed for 12 years.

Andrea Santon attacked the man after luring him back to her  home in Lancaster, Lancashire, following a night out in June.

She covered the man's eyes after the pair had sex and said that she had a surprise for him. She then proceeded to stab him in the back with a kitchen knife.

The man, who has not been named, was able to fight her off and phone emergency services. He was found by police after he collapsed in the road outside the £120,000 home.

Stanton, who had written a number of suicide notes before the attack, was arrested nearby with two knives. One was used to attack the victim and the other was used on herself in an attempt to take her own life.

Santon was convicted of attempted murder by a jury at Preston Crown Court today, the Crown Prosecution Service said.

Tom Snape, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West said: 'Andrea Santon carried out a premeditated attack on her ex-partner after luring him back to her address following an amicable night out.

'Following consensual sexual intercourse, she blindfolded him, told him she had a surprise for him then proceeded to stab him in the back with a kitchen knife. 

'Fortunately the blade of the knife hit his shoulder blade, he managed to fight her off and leave the house. 

'He contacted the emergency services and was discovered by the police collapsed in the road.

'Santon had previously written various suicide notes to friends and family, in which she had not named the victim as a survivor, which clearly showed her intention to take his life. 

'She was arrested nearby in possession of two knives, one of which she had used to stab the victim and the other she had used on herself in an attempt to take her own life.

'The CPS and police take all cases of domestic violence extremely seriously regardless of whether the victim is male or female, and will continue to work together to bring to justice those who commit such offences.'
