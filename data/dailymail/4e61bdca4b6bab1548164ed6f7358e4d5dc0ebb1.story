James Ward, a traveller who appeared on 'My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding' who has been jailed after crashing into a car while drink-driving

A traveller who appeared on the Channel 4 show 'My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding' has been jailed after he flipped his BMW sports car while drunkenly driving around in a revenge mission to find his son's killers.

James Ward flipped the car on to its roof after ploughing into another vehicle when he got behind the wheel while drunk, uninsured and disqualified from driving.

Northampton Crown Court heard how Ward was injured in a violent clash while travelling around looking to avenge his son Thomas' murder, who was killed last April.

Police were called when he was spotted drenched in blood at Watford Gap service station.

Officers then followed him for a short distance before watching him lose control of his car just before junction 15 of the M1 near Northampton on the A45 roundabout.

He crashed into another vehicle, causing serious injuries to a woman and child who were inside the car, who had to be airlifted to hospital.

At a previous hearing, the 40-year-old pleaded guilty to four charges of causing serious injury, driving while disqualified, driving with excess alcohol and driving with no insurance.

Today Ward from Leighton Buzzard, Bedforshire was jailed for 13 months.

Sentencing, Judge Rupert Mayo said it was a 'ghastly accident' after Ward failed to heed the police warnings to stop his vehicle.

Jeremy Janes, prosecuting, said the woman was left covered in glass and concerned for the welfare of her child.

Mr Janes said: 'The woman suffered a laceration of a cornea which has left her with permanent blurred vision and also suffered cuts to her head and abdomen.

'She and her three-year-old son, who was not physically injured, had suffered psychological distress since the crash.

'She has 
only just been able to start driving again and she has taken her son to a
 counsellor as he had become very anxious after the crash.'

The
 court heard that police officers had indicated for Ward to stop his 
vehicle, shortly before the crash, when he was parked at the Watford Gap
 services.

However, Ward sped away from the police car and crashed his BMW on the M1 roundabout at the next junction.

When they finally found him officers saw his car contained empty beer cans.

He was also found to be over the drink drive limit as he gave officers a blood alcohol reading of 102 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  The legal limit is 80 microgrammes.

Defending John Carmichael said: 'My client feels real grief and remorse for what he has done.

'He told me he will have to live with what he has done for the rest of his life.'

In April last year, Ward's son Thomas, 20, was murdered on the steps of his own caravan five days after the birth of his daughter Lily.

His funeral was shown on a My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding spin-off about christenings in October and Ward was seen mourning his son at his graveside.

In a Crimewatch appeal, police said they want to trace Thomas’s second cousin John Boy Ward, 32, and his wife Joleen, 21, in connection with the murder.

So far no arrests have been made.

But on May 25, Ward was told the suspects in his son’s killing were hiding in Coventry.

After driving to find them he ended up in an altercation and received 'significant' injuries as result.

Ward was sentenced to 12 months in jail for dangerous driving and one month, to be served consecutively, from driving whilst disqualified.

He was also banned from driving for three years.
