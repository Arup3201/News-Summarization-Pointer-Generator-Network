Military finance officer Paul Ridgway stole £20,000 of travellers' cheques from the SAS camp where he worked and blew the cash on a lads' holiday to Las Vegas

An army staff sergeant who snatched £20,000 of travellers' cheques from the SAS base and used them to fund a lads' holiday to Las Vegas has been spared jail.

Paul Ridgway was working as a military finance officer for the elite fighting force when he pocketed the currency notes from the camp. 

The 34-year-old and two friends used the cash to partially fund the trip to Las Vegas in April 2012 

Ridgway splashed £5,000 ($8,000) in just one night of the eight-day holiday after cashing in 77 of the stolen travellers' cheques.

He was handed a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months after he admitted theft and converting or attempting to convert criminal property at Worcester Crown Court.

The court heard Ridgway was on secondment with the finance office at the SAS Headquarters in Stirling Lines, Hereford, between December 2010 and May 2013 when he came across the bundle of cheques.

Prosecutor Michael Conry said Ridgway took the bills home on December 27, 2010 before telling his friends about them.

The court heard he gave cheques to four friends; Kevin Jinks, 36, Jamie Barber, 37, Andrew Morris, 32, and Garry Meir, 32.

Jinks also used some of the cheques to clear his debts with a sixth defendant, Anthony McQuaid, 36.

In April 2012 Ridgway, Morris and Meir went to Las Vegas on holiday.

When Meir was quizzed by police he admitted he carried a 1cm thick wad of the cheques with him and cashed £500 worth.

Morris cashed 129 cheques while Ridgway cashed in 77 cheques.

Mark Connor, defending, said Ridgway had given the cheques out in a 'grave error of judgement.'

He said when he returned to the UK he realised what he had done and put the cash in a bank account 'ready for the day he knew he would have to pay it back.'

But Ridgway 'effectively buried his head in the sand' when he received a promotion and was posted to Colombia until he received an email from his superiors regarding the cheques.

Mr Connor said: 'At that point he came clean straight away and told his commanding officer what had happened.

'He was in a position of trust because of his employment.

'Mr Ridgway is described as an outstanding soldier. This was clearly completely out of character and he is genuinely remorseful.'

The six defendants all admitted  theft and converting or attempting to convert criminal property at the hearing on Friday.

On sentencing Ridgway Recorder Martin Jackson told him: “You are the origin of the offending that has led to the other five being in the dock with you.

“The offence is serious enough to warrant imprisonment but if you are sent straight to custody your employer would be deprived of a contribution of a man who is well thought of.”

As well as the suspended prison sentence Ridgway, who now works at St John Moore Barracks in Folkestone, Kent, was also ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay back £16,779.
