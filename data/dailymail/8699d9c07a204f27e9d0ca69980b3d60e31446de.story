Grant Shapps accused Nick Clegg of hypocrisy yesterday as he insisted the government still intended to reduce migration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year.

The Tory party chairman denied the Liberal Democrat leader’s claim that his party had secretly dropped their pledge to reduce net migration less than 100,000.

In an interview, he said the target ‘remained party policy’. Last year net migration was 212,000.

Hit back: Grant Shapps has hit back at Nick Clegg's claims the party's migration figures are based on a 'fallacy'

Mr Clegg used a speech in London yesterday to accuse the Conservatives of being ‘completely fixated with the net migration target’ which he said was based on a ‘fallacy’.

He accused the Conservatives of failing to carry out basic border checks to make sure illegal immigrants and those overstaying on their visas were caught.

And in a significant change of tone called for much tighter controls on immigration from new EU states, saying people had lost faith in the government’s assurances following the arrival of 60,000 Bulgarians and Romanians.

He suggested giving EU member states the right to impose controls ‘if people begin arriving in numbers too big for our society to absorb successfully’.

But Mr Shapps told LBC radio that it was Mr Clegg who had been standing in the way of the Coalition taking action to rein in immigration.

On the immigration target he said: ‘It remains the policy, it has not changed. We do want to see immigration reduced to tens of thousands’.

Accusations: The Tory chairman reacted by saying Nick Clegg gas blocked calls to rein in EU migration

He accused the Lib Dem leader of performing a ‘u turn’ similar to the party’s stance on tuition fees – which they pledged to abolish in opposition, but have now risen to £9,000 a year.

The Conservative party chairman said: ‘The surprising thing about it is that he has never raised any of these concerns that I am aware of privately over the last few years.

‘What’s more, he has actively blocked several of the common sense straightforward assessments... he’s stood in the way of those things happening - for example blocked our calls to rein in EU migration.

‘It’s very strange. You would have thought even in the background, in private you might have heard some of these things. I thought it was an extraordinary speech to make.’
