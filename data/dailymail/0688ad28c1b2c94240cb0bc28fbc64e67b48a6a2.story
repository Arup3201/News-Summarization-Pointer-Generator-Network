Claims: Fox New president Roger Ailes allegedly offered to pay a female TV producer an extra $100 a week if she had sex with him whenever he wanted, according to a new biography

Fox News chairman Roger Ailes once offered to pay a female TV producer $100 extra a week for sex, a damning new book alleges.

While negotiating her salary at NBC in the 1980s, Randi Harrison claims Mr Ailes offered her the raise 'if you agree to have sex with me whenever I want.'

Fox News has denied the allegations.

In another anecdote, it was claimed that Mr Ailes was so dismissive of even his best talent that he referred to star host Bill O'Reilly as 'a book salesman with a TV show'.

The claims have been made in a biography called The Loudest Voice In The Room by Gabriel Sherman, a contributing editor at New York magazine who has charted the 73-year-old's life from his childhood in Ohio to one of the most powerful positions in television.

Under his leadership at Fox News Channel, the network now regularly pulls in more viewers than MSNBC and CNN combined, according to the New York Times which has been given prior access to the book.

However, today, Mr Aisles hit back, telling The Hollywood Reporter that publishers Random House had failed to fact-check the contents of the book with him or Fox representatives.

The news chief had refused to co-operate with the book and said: 'Bette Davis said, I think it was Bette Davis, ‘What other people think of me is none of my business.’

'Attacking me and Fox News is nothing new – it’s a cottage industry. What’s new is that Random House refused to fact check the content with me or Fox News -- that tells you everything you need to know about this book and its agenda.

Despite this, author Sherman retorted in a statement to Politico: 'During two and a half years of reporting, I made a dozen requests both in writing and in person to speak with Roger Ailes about every aspect of my book, The Loudest Voice In The Room.

'A team of two fact-checkers spent more than 2,000 hours vetting the manuscript before publication. Roger Ailes declined every request to discuss the reporting with me.'

Fox News has also become the most profitable division of 21st Century Fox with annual earnings of around $1billion.

As such, the book claims that Mr Ailes
 was so eager to influence national politics that in the run-up to the 
2012 presidential election he told fellow Fox News executives that he 
wanted to 'elect the next president'.

Mr
 Sherman says that, despite being unsatisfied with many of the 
Republican candidates, Mr Ailes nevertheless sought to promote Mitt 
Romney on his programs.

The 560-page biography also points to a four-minute video criticising Barack Obama which incited outrage from the left.

At the time, the network publicly stated that Mr Ailes was not involved in the broadcast, aired on Fox and Friends.

But the book claims it was actually his 'brainchild'.

According to the book's website, Mr Sherman 'chronicles the rise of Ailes, a sickly kid from an Ohio factory town who, through sheer willpower, the flair of a showman, fierce corporate politicking, and a profound understanding of the priorities of middle America, built the most influential television news empire of our time'.

Some Fox employees are already dismissing
 the book, with prime time host Sean Hannity describing Mr Sherman as a 
'phony journalist' on Twitter.

Mr Ailes even chose a journalist to write his biography after Mr Sherman had started his.

A Fox News spokeswoman said: 'While we have not read the book, the only reality here is that Gabe was not provided any direct access to Roger Ailes and the book was never fact-checked with Fox News.'

The book is due out on January 21.
