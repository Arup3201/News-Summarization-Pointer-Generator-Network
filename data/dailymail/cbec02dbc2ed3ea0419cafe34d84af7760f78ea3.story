There were two pivotal events in 1974 in the life of Reg Presley, legendary lead singer of The Troggs, who died of lung cancer this week at the age of 71.

The first, which I witnessed, took place at Farnborough College of Technology in Hampshire, where I was studying.

The Troggs, having had a series of hits in the Sixties, were then at their career nadir, playing a college gig for a fee that would have amounted to no more than £100.

A group of what newspapers of the era would have described as ‘members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club’ were tormenting the band, jeering insults and aiming spurts of fizzy drinks at the lead singer.

Wild Thing, the band’s huge hit of 1966, had gone down a storm, but the bikers had turned truculent as soon as the band started playing Love Is All Around — the song that would later spark The Troggs’ renaissance.

All of a sudden, Presley hurled himself off the stage - disappearing in a tangled, thrashing heap along with his tormentors. The concert was at an end.

In the subsequent melee, two of the band were stabbed. Richard Moore, the guitarist, nearly died; another was bottled and Presley emerged with a broken nose.

It was a miracle that none of them was killed, but their narrow escape was nowhere near as miraculous as Reg’s experience several weeks later. 

Mysterious: The singer was convinced aliens were behind a spate of elaborate crop circles in Hampshire and Wiltshire fields in the 1990s

Still nursing his bruises at the Andover home he shared with his wife Brenda, he was dozing in front of the TV in the middle of the afternoon when he heard a news bulletin about a huge fire at Flixborough, Lincolnshire in which 28 people died.

Few of the regulars at Reg’s local, the Barge in Pewsey Vale, are unfamiliar with what happened next, the singer having related the story countless times in his soft Hampshire burr.

‘I tell my wife about the fire,’ he would say. ‘Six o’clock, I turn on the news again and it says the explosion only happened at eight minutes to five.

‘How did I see a report about a disaster four hours before it happened? Could the broadcast signal have been affected by gravity?’

Theories: Reg Presley, seen with his wife Brenda, died this week following a battle with lung cancer

Even if gravity did have an effect on television signals - an effect hitherto unknown to physics - it remains unclear why this would allow Reg to pick up and decode a signal before it was broadcast.

But Reg was never overly-concerned by the details of the unexplained phenomena with which he subsequently became obsessed.

UFOs; aliens; the true origins of ancient stone circles. Reg was happy to theorise on all of them with scant regard to conventional science or history.

However, it was one particular aspect of the paranormal with which Reg became most closely associated: crop circles.

When there was a spate of mysterious and increasingly elaborate patterns in Hampshire and Wiltshire fields in the early 1990s, Reg was fascinated - and quick to offer an explanation.

The cereal fields of south-western England were, he said, a stopping point for extraterrestrial craft, and the mysterious giant symbols were clearly messages - perhaps even warnings - from an alien intelligence to a doomed humanity.

With a fellow scholar of the unexplained, retired Andover driving instructor Busty Taylor, Reg spent the next few years hastening to each new circle as it appeared, and offering his interpretation of the symbol’s hidden meaning.

‘We met first on July 17, 1990, at the giant crop circle at Alton Barnes near Devizes, and we became firm friends,’ Busty recalls. ‘We explored many circles together. He was of the older generation who would not hesitate to help people and talk through their possible meaning.’

Reg ascribed great significance to the fact that many circles appeared in a triangle between Warminster, Wantage and Winchester.

‘Look at the first few letters of each place,’ he told an interviewer in 1994. ‘War, Want, Win. Is that a message, or what?’

Such was worldwide enthusiasm for the crop circles that Reg and Busty were soon giving talks around the country, and going on lecture tours in the U.S. and Germany. Often, the talks would be accompanied by a Troggs gig.

When the huge success of the film Four Weddings And A Funeral brought Reg an unexpected windfall - Wet Wet Wet’s cover of Love Is All Around was used in the 1994 movie and topped the charts for 15 weeks - he used the money to fund his interest.

He even wrote a book, Wild Things They Don’t Tell Us, which explored alien abductions, crop circles, and what he saw as the close relationship between UFOs and ancient monuments.

When crop circles were eventually proved to have been created by pranksters, Reg and Busty refused to concede defeat. Although they accepted that 75 per cent of shapes were man-made, they maintained that the rest defied explanation.

Renaissance: The band struggled during the 1970s and '80s, but experienced a career renaissance after Love Is All Around featured in Four Weddings And A Funeral

‘Reg was about the most grounded, sensible person I’ve encountered in the music business,’ says his life-long friend, music publicist Keith Altham. ‘But he had a tendency to watch an episode of The X Files and believe it was true.

‘It was a terrible setback when crop circles were debunked, but he clung to the hope that at least a few of them were genuine.’

It was Keith who gave Reg Presley his surname (after Elvis) in 1966, two years after The Troggs were formed. ‘Reginald Ball’ was just insufficiently ‘rock ’n’ roll’.

‘When he read the new name in New Musical Express, he rang me to ask (with his wonderful country boy accent) whether he’d been dropped from the band,’ Keith recalls.

Reg, a bricklayer by trade, also used to tell the story of how he was working on a building when he heard the first Troggs single on the radio.

‘Share my tools out, lads - I’m off,’ he announced.

The 1970s and Eighties were hard decades for the band, but then the film Four Weddings allowed Presley to emerge from obscurity and find success on the rock ’n’ roll nostalgia circuit, even playing at Sting’s wedding a decade ago.

‘He never lost his enthusiasm for little green men and UFOs,’ says Keith. ‘Shortly before he died, he contacted me to say that there was a large aircraft hanger underneath the Sphinx in Egypt - and he was sure there was a UFO parked there. Would Sting put up a bit of money, he asked, to help find it?

‘But despite that, he could be teased about his views and never seemed offended. He was a very sweet country boy.’

Reg’s musical legacy is uncertain. It is difficult to tell how history will remember a lyricist capable of penning lines such as ‘A boy’s not a boy and a man’s not a man till he’s been with a girl like my Joanne’ and ‘My lady owns an oil well. Just one look, and you can tell.’

Appropriately, news of his death was made public by the Andover Advertiser after an American phoned from California having read an item on the Twitter account of former BBC sports commentator and outer-world obsessive David Icke.How David Icke - who knew Reg well - came by the news is a mystery. 

Perhaps Reg would have preferred to have been abducted by aliens and borne away in a celestial hearse. But his many friends and fans are grateful he died peacefully at home with his family nearby.
