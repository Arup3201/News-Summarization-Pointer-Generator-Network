One of the UK's top competitive growers says he and his rivals are installing lasers and expensive alarm systems to ward off potential saboteurs

Growers of giant vegetables have been known to sleep by their vegetables to protect their prized assets from saboteurs.

But it seems some of the UK’s top competitive gardeners are now finding increasingly high-tech ways to guard their humongous produce.

One of the UK’s top competitive growers says he and his rivals are installing lasers and expensive alarm systems to ward off potential saboteurs.

Kevin Fortey, who runs the Giant Veg website, said he has set up infrared lights in his poly-tunnel and greenhouse which are linked to an alarm in his house.

The gardener from Cwmbran in South Wales said his rivals – including Ian Neale, who produced the worlds-largest swede – have also set up alarm systems.

With prizes of up to £1000, competition particularly heats up before the UK National Giant Vegetable Championships at the Malvern Autumn Show in September.

Last summer, BBC documentary ‘Allotment Wars’ revealed plot owners’ prized vegetables were being snatched and their sheds ransacked by rivals.

Mr Fortey joked that they may have got the idea from Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit, where the animated characters set up an alarm system to protect their giant marrows from a giant rabbit.

He told Waitrose Weekend: ‘If someone’s got something big growing for a show there’s competitive rivalry.

‘I think there is always the fear that something might happen. It’s in the back of your mind.’

In America, competition is so fierce that many growers sleep by their pumpkins in order to protect rivals from sabotage.

Yesterday, he added : ‘Over the last couple of years, more and more people have been setting up alarm systems. It’s often so they can protect their expensive Keder greenhouses.

‘We have seen poly-tunnels being slashed – though we don’t know if it’s competitiors or just mindless thugs.’

Sharon Gilbert, communications manager at the Malvern Autumn Show, said she wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest if competitors were resorting to alarm systems.

She said: ‘There is a lot of competition among growers - they are very, very serious with what they do. They keep their growing secrets close to their chests.’

Mr Fortrey, who entered a 12 stone 3lb marrow at the 2010 competition, is entering in to 20 of the 24 classes this year.
