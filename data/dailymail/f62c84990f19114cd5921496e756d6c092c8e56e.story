A young underage girl was on a child protection watch list before she was picked up at Sydney Airport

Australian authorities have stopped an uncle and his 14-year-old niece from leaving Sydney for Lebanon due to fears the teenage girl would be forced into a prearranged marriage.

Federal and State agencies swooped on the couple at Sydney Airport on Friday afternoon after a joint investigation revealed that the girl was departing for Lebanon for the purpose of a wedding - possibly linked to a terror organisation.

It is understood the girl  was on an airport watch list for children at risk, and authorities acted when the pair triggered the alarm at Sydney Airport.

Authorities have been put on high alert at international departure points in the wake of Islamic State extremists launching a social media recruitment campaign to lure young brides to wed terrorists.

But a Department of Immigration and Border Protection spokeswoman told The Sunday Telegraph there was no suggestion that this girl was travelling to Lebanon for that specific reason.

'The government can confirm that an adult male and a female minor were prevented from boarding a flight at Sydney International Airport,' the spokeswoman said.

'The prevention from boarding was not counter-terror related.'

She said the pair were  questioned and allowed to leave, but for privacy reasons could not provide more details.

Middle Eastern terrorist groups have been behind a campaign to recruit young wives for marriage 

The case of the young girl comes after a spokeswoman for the Immigrant Women's Health Service last week warned of ISIS's public appeal to lure wives to the Middle East.

Dr Eman Sharobeem said the call for women and female children left Australian girls vulnerable of being sent overseas against their will.

The NSW Family and Community Services Department, along with police, are the joint investigators for under-age marriage. 

A FACS spokeswoman said it relied on information from the community to report children at risk, but  can not discuss the details of specific cases for privacy reasons.

'Legislation does not allow Family and Community Services to discuss the details of any cases that involve child protection matters,' she said.

'Regardless of whether or not a marriage has purportedly taken place, sexual relations with an underage person is a crime and will be dealt with as such by both FACS and NSW Police.'

NSW Family and Community Services Pru Goward last year launched an investigation into the practice and wrote to Mr Morrison and other relevant senior ministers in relation to the case of a 12-year-old girl allegedly being married to a 26-year-old overseas student. 

Another 14-year-old avoided being smuggled out of the country by her parents to be wed after pleading with her school counsellor to intervene.

In a separate case in June, 2012, a 14-year-old Iraqi girl returned to Australia pregnant.

She said: 'Girls should have the right to a childhood free from abuse, or a marriage imposed upon them.'

 She also said all girls in Australia should have the opportunity to make her own choices, including marriage.
