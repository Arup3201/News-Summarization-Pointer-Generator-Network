The BBC has splashed more than £34.4million of licence fee cash on taxis in just three years, it can be revealed.

The eye-watering spending splurge amounts to nearly £31,450 a day or 236,675 licence fees.

The Corporation ran up a taxi bill of £10.7million in 2011-12, £11.8million in 2012-13 and £11.9million in 2013-14.

It includes more than £200,000 to pay for cabs ordered, only to be cancelled on arrival and additional fees charged by drivers left waiting outside.

The figures, released following a Freedom of Information request, are taken from the Corporation's central booking system.

But staff can also book taxis themselves and claim the money back on expenses, meaning the BBC's full taxi is spend will be even higher.

A BBC spokesperson said: 'More than a third of taxis are to get guests to and from shows and many journalists and columnists are happy to use them when they appear on our programmes. We also make sure staff get home safe when they finish working in the middle of the night.' 

The BBC has broken down around 16% of the £34.4million by department, but refused to do so for the remaining 84%, which includes radio, TV and news.

Of the £5.4million it was willing to detail, nearly £63,000 was spent on taxis cancelled on arrival, which accounted for 1.5% of bookings.

Additional charges for waiting were added to 11% of bookings at a cost of £171,000.

The departments covered in the breakdown are BBC Monitoring, Finance and Operations, BBC Trust, Strategy and Digital and BBC Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

They racked up a combined 252,746 journeys at an average cost of £21.40 each.
