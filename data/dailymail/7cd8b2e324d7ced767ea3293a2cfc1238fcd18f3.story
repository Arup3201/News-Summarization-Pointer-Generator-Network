Amazon was dragged into the scandal over a notorious cyber-bullying site yesterday after it emerged that the web retailer ‘hosts’ the controversial social network.

It can shut down Ask.fm, but has ignored a plea to do so from a British internet safety consultant.

The revelation prompted the parents of children who died after being trolled on the ‘disgusting’ website to urge Amazon to take action, while experts accused Ask.fm of ‘promoting’ cyber-bullying.

The homepage of ask.fm: Jennifer Perry, author of the UK national guidelines on combating digital stalking, said the website promoted trolling by encouraging anonymous abuse

David Smith, whose daughter Hannah, 14, was found hanged on Friday after months of abuse, yesterday called on Amazon to shut down Latvian-based Ask.fm.

Hannah was urged to kill herself or ‘drink bleach’ on the site, which earns £5million a year from adverts and lets its 60million members post comments anonymously.

Mr Smith, a 45-year-old lorry driver from Lutterworth, Leicestershire, said: ‘I’m shocked that a supposedly respectable company such as Amazon could be connected to Ask.fm.

'Unfortunately, the big internet companies such as Ask.fm and Amazon are only interested  in money.

‘Ask.fm
makes £5million a year by causing people misery. If I decided to cause 
people misery I would be arrested and sent down.’

Charles Conway, an internet child safety consultant, said he contacted Amazon in May after conducting a Google search of phrases such as ‘kill yourself’ and ‘ugly sl**’ that revealed more than 59,000 examples of bullying and racist or threatening comments on Ask.fm.

But even though Amazon’s acceptable-usage policy gives it the right to terminate customers’ use of its service if they ‘encourage, promote or facilitate harmful or offensive’ content, he was ‘fobbed off’ and told to take up his concerns with Ask.fm directly.

Yesterday, Mr Conway called for the site to be classed alongside porn as ‘adult content’, meaning it could be blocked from homes under Government plans to clean up the internet next year.

Mr Conway, from Wrexham, North Wales, said: ‘I cannot see a legitimate use for Ask.fm other than for cyber-bullying.

'The company knows exactly what sort of abuse goes on, yet does nothing to tackle it.’

He discovered Ask.fm was hosted by Amazon, which rents web-space on its servers, after being called by a parent whose 12-year-old daughter was almost suicidal.

Trolls on the site had targeted her because she would not sleep with her boyfriend.

Jennifer Perry, author of the UK 
national guidelines on combating digital stalking, said Ask.fm promoted 
trolling by encouraging anonymous abuse, adding: ‘It means everybody 
becomes your stalker, you don’t know if it’s a stranger or your best 
friend that’s doing it. That’s very distressing.’

Last autumn, two Irish girls – Ciara Pugsley, 15, and Erin Gallagher, 13  – took their lives after being bullied on the site.

Eight weeks later, Erin’s sister, Shannon, 15, killed herself in grief. Ciara’s father, Jonathan, said Amazon should ‘examine their morals’, adding: ‘You’d think someone as big as Amazon would be distancing themselves from sites like this.’

Tony Traynor, father of Erin and Shannon Gallagher, said he would boycott Amazon, adding: ‘Someone has to take the blame. If Amazon is providing the web-space for Ask.fm then they should close it.’

In April, Josh Unsworth, 15, was found hanged in Goosnargh,  Lancashire, after suffering months of abusive messages on Ask.fm. His father, Gary, called on Amazon to ‘take some responsibility’.

Amazon has not commented.
