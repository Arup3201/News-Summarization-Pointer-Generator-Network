Darren Offord, the homeless brother of  MP Matthew Offord, has spoken of their different fortunes after urging his brother to help him rebuild his life

The homeless brother of a Conservative MP has told of his miserable life on the streets after urging his brother to help him.

Darren Offord - the brother of MP for Hendon Matthew Offord - sleeps rough in the family's hometown of Alton, Hampshire.

After issuing a plea for support from his brother, he spoke of his dismay that his sibling lives in thatched country house while he sleeps in a council bin shed.

The 48-year-old told MailOnline: 'He's with the Prime Minister while I'm sat here like a tramp with long dreadlocks.

'He's better off than we all are. We went to the same school and had a very similar upbringing but things turn out very differently don't they?'

Despite enjoying a similar childhood to his politician brother, with the pair attending the same school together, the brothers' lives could not be more different now.

Huddled under a blanket next to a row of large council  bins, self-confessed former heroin addict Darren spends his days drinking strong lager.

Meanwhile Michael, who is three years his junior, is seen as one of the rising stars of the Tory party after winning the seat of Hendon, north London.

The politician married wife Claire at a lavish ceremony in 2010 and  held the reception at Highclere Castle, the home of popular ITV drama Downtown Abbey.

He now divides his time between his family home - a thatched £785,000 cottage in Boxford, Berkshire - and his constituency home in the capital.

Former HGV driver and psychiatric nurse Darren claims his life went downhill when he was hit by a drink-driver in 1992.

The father-of-two said: 'I was in hospital for a long time. I lost everything because I couldn't go back to work.

'I had a normal, nice family life beforehand but I lost my mortgage, my partner and that's how I ended up like I am now. People can learn a lot from that - how not to end up like me.' 

He has hit out at what he sees as the failure of the government to help people like him get off the streets and urged his brother to 'put your arm out and lift me up'.

Relatives say Matthew and others have repeatedly attempted to help Darren back to his feet but his lifestyle is 'his choice'.

Then and now: Darren Offord (pictured, left, four years ago and, right, today) says a car accident ruined his life. His family however claim he made a 'choice' to live on the streets

Mr Offord, who sleeps in a council bin shed, has called on his brother to help him off the streets

A family member, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It has hurt the whole family. He has been given every help - he's had no end of help but it's just the drink and the drugs which have made Darren what he is.

'We've done everything we can - he's broken our hearts so much but I can't help Darren, none of us can.'

She said he had been in and out of prison for drug-related and public order offences and has been sent to rehab at least five times.

The relative confirmed Darren was involved in a horrific car accident, but said his drinking started before the crash.

She added: 'I'm sorry because he was a lovely child, he really was. I'm surprised he's still alive with what he's done and the abuse he's put his body through.

'He just drinks and drinks and that's his life I'm afraid. It's very sad and there's a lot of people like it and families have to go through an awful lot with it.'

Matthew Offord has yet to comment on his brother's claims.

The MP, who used to work for the BBC, was elected to parliament in 2010 and is the treasurer of the All Parliamentary Select Committee on Anti-Semitism. 

The 45-year-old  previously worked as deputy leader of Barnet Council, where he was also head of cabinet member of environment and transport.

Matthew Offord has been MP for Hendon since 2010. In 2011 he tried to overturn a rule banning him from bringing his Jack Russell, Max, to work with him

When his brother was elected as an MP in 2010, Darren Offord posted a video on Facebook of his victory speech along with the caption: 'How lucky am I?'

In 2011, he invoked human rights laws to overturn a ban on taking his dog into Westminster.

Speaking at the time, he said it was 'ridiculous' he could not bring his Jack Russell, Max, to work with him, insisting: 'He doesn't bark, my staff have no complaints and he's great for taking the stress out of the day.' 

According to the most recent official statistics, 111,960 people are registered as homeless - a 26 per cent rise over four years.

The government recently defended its record on homelessness, pointing to its Fair Chance Fund, a £15million programme to help young people living on the streets.

Last month, homelessness Minister Kris Hopkins pointed out that the government has announced £23million-worth of funding to help those with nowhere to live.

She said: 'This money will pay for sustained housing, employment and educational support for those with the greatest needs, helping them find accommodation, gain qualifications and move into work.'
