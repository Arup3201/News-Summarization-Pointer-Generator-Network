Google is on a par with God in terms of public trust, a study has revealed.

When asked to rank organisations they believe have their interests at heart, religious institutions came out on top for a very modest 17 per cent of people – exactly the same as the omnipresent internet search engine.

Reason to celebrate: Chief executive Eric Schmidt's company Google is as trusted as religious institutions

And in a world where more people go shopping than to church on a Sunday, it seems that many now place their faith in supermarkets, as the big chains such as Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s were held up as most trustworthy by 19 per cent.

Uphill struggle: New Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will have to find a way to reconnect with the British public

The figures may well alarm the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Rt Rev Justin Welby, who faces an uphill struggle in reconnecting with the concerns of ordinary Britons.

The study asked more than 2,000 people to rank the top three institutions they trusted the most. Overall, the NHS came out highest on 37 per cent, ahead of the police on 26 per cent and big charities on 21 per cent.

As well as revealing which organisations the public relies on, the Future Of Britain report, published today, aimed to lift the lid on how the rising cost of living and economic crisis has imposed lifestyle changes – and it claims to reveal a nation in survival mode.

It said: ‘We are highly pessimistic about our economic future. Most Britons – 73 per cent – envisage at least two more years of economic misery.

Within this, 11 per cent think it’s permanent, 21 per cent believe it could last five to ten years and 41 per cent two to five years.’

But the report added: ‘Rather than being defeatist, in many ways the slump is bringing out British qualities last seen during World War Two, such as prudence, self-reliance, self-confidence, personal responsibility, flexible attitudes to work and mobility and a greater interest in local communities.’
