On Sunday evening, as England’s players were filing out of their charity ball, the lead singer of the Kaiser Chiefs shouted at them to come home ‘with the ******* trophy’.

It was 11.30pm and the lead singer Ricky Wilson had the monied audience at the Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire in raptures as he belted out the band’s new track Coming Home.

The Kaisers were the send-off act at the Lions and Roses dinner, a lavish affair put on by the England Footballers Foundation before their World Cup preparations started for real.

Haul: These were just some of the items up for auction at England's money-raising charity gala

This is the unseen side of international football, when England's players put on their Marks & Spencers sponsored suits for formal occasions.

During the 2013-14 season, Rays of Sunshine, the British Forces Foundation and the Bobby Moore Fund at Cancer Research UK have all benefited from the EFF.

On this night alone, England’s players raised £362,000. It is an extraordinary sum of money, with various auction prizes fetching five figure sums from a room full of 500, mostly wealthy guests.

Bidding to sit in Steven Gerrard’s executive box at Liverpool for one game and the chance to meet the England captain post-match fetched the best part of £30,000.

An impromptu lot, proposed by event host Gabby Logan, to stand on the stage with the England squad for a ‘selfie’ was eventually sold for £12,000.

A lot of drink had been taken by then, but it made somebody’s night.

Then a round of golf with England keeper Joe Hart and Wayne Rooney went for more than £10,000 and six VIP nights in Las Vegas with three pals went for something similar.

Towards the end of the evening, a random guest approached a member of staff at the FA and offered £1,000 for his official England tie. He instantly exchanged it on the proviso that it was the only item of clothing he was prepared to remove. It was quite a night.

Even Roy Hodgson’s squad of players, who are used to earning extravagant sums of money with the top clubs in the Barclays Premier League, sat open-mouthed at the size of the bids.

In an era when it is so easy to casually criticise the players, this event, in football parlance, could be described as ‘a leveller’.

Every member of that squad, from captain Steven Gerrard and vice-captain Frank Lampard to Southampton trio Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Luke Shaw, understood their roles and responsibilities.

It has to be said, it was pretty refreshing.

Understanding their roles: The squad including (from left) Adam Lallana, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling helped raise a lot of money

Many of them know that when it comes to the World Cup, with group games against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica to come, that it can get bloody.

With the exception of Wayne Rooney (who was already in Portugal) and Jack Wilshere (excused until 11pm to celebrate Arsenal’s FA Cup success), every England player was in attendance.

They sat on tables of 10 and were allowed, with the permission of the head coach Hodgson, a glass of wine or a glass of beer with their meal. They behaved impeccably.

When the Kaisers’ lead singer jumped on to a table of England players singing their classic Oh My God, he thrust a microphone into James Milner’s face and demanded that he sang the chorus ‘I’ve never been this far away from home’.

Hart was next and then Lallana, clearly hoping to avoid Wilson’s gaze, was suddenly belting it out for the benefit of the audience. They were good sports.

Happy to help: Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jagielka were all smiles but the England players were gobsmacked by the amount of money raised

There was a good deal of respect in that room from the England squad as Terry Byrne, who runs the EFF on behalf of the players, spoke about the beneficiaries.

In the past, financial support from the England Footballers Foundation has been sent to the earthquake victims in Haiti (2010).

In 2012, when torrential rain forced England’s World Cup qualifier with Poland in Warsaw to be postponed for 24 hours, the players funded the extra night’s stay for the stranded fans.  

During Byrne’s passionate speech the players listened intently, never once wavering to mess about with their mobile phones or turn to each other to speak as Byrne outlined the Foundation’s aims. Good on them.

Byrne, a former England team masseur who went on to manage David Beckham, explained that the squad’s match fees are diverted to the Foundation’s charity partners.

The stage is set: Kaiser Chiefs performed their single Coming Home at the gala

It has been this way since 2007, when the more prominent and influential members of the England team generously decided to give them up in favour of charitable causes.

As Byrne continued, they seek no publicity (he has no idea this has been written, for example) and there is very little knowledge of the EFF’s work.

During the season, without fuss or fanfare, members of the squad commit to events all over country on behalf of the Foundation.

They do it unflinchingly and judging by Byrne’s sentiments, along with the video presentation, the visits from England’s players make people’s day.
