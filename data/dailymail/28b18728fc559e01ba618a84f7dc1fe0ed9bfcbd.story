Two British tourists have died in the Netherlands after snorting what is believed to have been white heroin that was sold to them as cocaine.

The men aged 20 and 21 were found dead in an Amsterdam hotel room after taking a deadly batch of drugs just days after Dutch police stopped issuing warnings to holidaymakers.

The Foreign Office is liaising with Dutch authorities and is 'providing consular assistance to the family', a spokesman said

One British visitor has died and 14 other tourists - mainly from the UK – have been taken ill in recent weeks after snorting white heroin which is being sold as cocaine.

Police spokesman Rob van der Veen said the bodies of the two men, both from England, were found next to traces of a white powder.

The men's names have not yet been released by officials.

A post-mortem examination is due to be conducted later this week to confirm the time and cause of their deaths.

'We did a quick test to find out what kind of powder it was. It wasn't cocaine, it was an opiate - in this case, white heroin,' Mr van der Veen said.

'We took the sample to the Dutch forensic institute and they found out that the contents of this material is the same contents as other material that we already seized in other cases where people got sick.'

He said investigators believe the men were targeted by the same street dealer, or ring of dealers, involved in the death of another Briton last month

Amsterdam police had launched a major public alert targeted at visitors from Britain, many of whom view taking drugs as a big part of the city’s attraction, including English-language matrix-style signs reading: ‘Extremely dangerous cocaine is sold to tourists.’

But after no cases for more than a fortnight, the authorities ended the alert at the weekend – meaning the two Britons found dead in their hotel room on Tuesday after apparently snorting the drug may have been unaware of the warning.

Police in the city have now urgently resumed their awareness campaign, putting up posters in hotels and hostels and handing out fliers.

There have been at least 14 other cases, although until this week’s tragedy all were found in the street, meaning passers-by were able to raise the alarm.

Police blame a rogue dealer who is selling white heroin – regarded as a ‘luxury’ version of the drug, which is normally brown-tinged – as cocaine to unsuspecting English-speaking visitors.

No arrests have been made, but they believe the dealer is unaware as he is selling at cocaine prices, rather than white heroin which is more expensive.

The double tragedy comes a month after a 22-year-old British tourst died after apparently taking cocaine and heroin on a trip to Amsterdam.

Joel McDevitt was taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city, but discharged himself before he was treated.

Officers found him nearby and took him to a police station, where he had to be resuscitated.

He was then taken back to hospital, but later died.

Mr van der Veen added: ‘The last such incident was two-and-a-half weeks ago, so we hoped he was through the merchandise and stopped the alerts at the weekend.

‘The other cases were people found in the street, but unfortunately these men were staying in a hotel so nobody was aware of what had happened until staff found their bodies.’

Leaflets handed out to visitors since last month at main squares and Amsterdam's Centraal railway station warn: ‘The last couple of weeks several tourists were hospitalized with severe health problems after using cocaine bought on the street.

‘Research has revealed that the cocaine used was not cocaine but white heroin.’

They add that in Amsterdam ‘you won't be arrested for taking drugs’.

A UN report named Amsterdam and Antwerp as Europe’s top cities for cocaine use based on analysis of urine in sewage, the equivalent to 1.5 grams per day per 1,000 people.
