Scrap learning her ABCs, this baby's getting a surf lesson.

Kris Strong, 35, from Clearwater, Florida, decided to show his seven-month-old daughter how to ride the waves.

The duo were filmed at home in the nursery room as they writhed around on the floor, paddling their arms over the carpet.

Baby Strong appears to take to surfing like a duck to water.

'Swimming on the surf board, then stand up,' Mr Strong says as he lays on his belly.

He continues to repeat a swimming and push-up action, with his daughter cleverly following his moves.

Strong then takes the lesson up a gear.

'Now we're going to go the whole way. Swim, push to standing,' the doting father instructs.

He is seen helping his student up on two feet and spreading her arms wide. 

A woman filming the scene is heard laughing in the background as the youngster wobbles up straight. 

Many viewers have deemed the beginner surf lesson 'cute' and 'adorable'.
