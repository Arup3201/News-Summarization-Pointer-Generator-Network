A spectacular performance unfolds underneath one of China's most mystical mountain ranges.

This is the Impression Lijiang, the highest altitude production in the world.

It is a daily performance of song, dance, horse riding and story beneath the 18,300ft peak of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in China's south-western Yunnan province.

Created by internationally acclaimed Chinese film director Zhang Yimou, and performed at 3310m above sea level the daily performance of song, dance, horse riding and story telling is the highest altitude production in the world

The show is put on by performers from the Naxi, Yi and Bai ethnic minorities near Lijiang. Created by internationally-acclaimed Chinese film director Zhang Yimou, it is performed at 10,800ft above sea level.

Among the performers are members of the Naxi Ancient Music Orchestra who played on a specially-constructed on stage.

According to the orchestra's director, 84-year-old Professor Xuanke, Naxi music was born between 1382 and 1383, during the Ming Dynasty when soldiers were sent Yunnan province and subsequently decided to bring their families and lay down their roots.

With less than 100 musicians still able to play, and most of them above 60 years of age, the ancient Naxi music faces extinction.

Estimates suggest unless the younger generation, now more interested in pop than traditional music, decides to keep this tradition alive, the ancient Naxi music will disappear within 40 years.

Jade Dragon Snow Mountain now is a favourite spot for tourists who go sightseeing, mountaineering and skiing

The Jade Dragon Snow Mountain - 
otherwise known as Yulong Mountain - is the southernmost glacier in the 
Northern Hemisphere. It is a sanctuary for rare animals and wild plants.

Consisting
of 13 peaks, among which Shanzidou is the highest with an altitude of 
18,360 feet, the mountain stretches a length of 22 miles and a width of 
13 miles.

Legend has 
it that once upon a time, Jade Dragon Snow Mountain and the nearby Haba 
Snow Mountain were twins. They had lived on panning in Golden Sand River
until one day an evil fiend usurped the river.

The mountain is a holy place for the local Naxi people because it was a place for young lovers to sacrifice themselves in honour of true love

The brothers were very brave and had a
fierce fight with the fiend, Haba died in the fight and Jade Dragon 
drove off the fiend after wearing out 13 swords. For guarding the people
and preventing the return of the fiend, Jade Dragon held the 13 swords 
in hands day and night.

As time passed, the brothers had turned into the two snow mountains, and the 13 swords had become the 13 peaks.

The
mountain is a holy place for the local Naxi people not only because of 
the legend, but also because it was a place for young lovers to 
sacrifice themselves in honour of true love and to escape from the 
arranged marriages and feudal ethics.

Nowadays, Jade Dragon Snow Mountain is a favourite spot for tourists who go sightseeing, mountaineering and skiing.
