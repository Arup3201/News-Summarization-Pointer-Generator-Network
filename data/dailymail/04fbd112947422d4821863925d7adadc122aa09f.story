Ralph Steinman, 68, who won the Nobel prize for medicine today for work on fighting cancer, died of the disease himself just three days before he could be told of his award

A New York scientist working on a cure for cancer
today won the Nobel prize for medicine - only for the committee to discover he had tragically died of the disease just three days ago.

Ralph Steinman, 68, had been
treating himself with a groundbreaking therapy based on his own research into
the body's immune system but died on Friday after a four-year battle with
pancreatic cancer.

The Nobel committee at Sweden's Karolinska
Institute said it was aware of
Steinman's death - but it appeared that it had not known before making its
announcement.

His colleagues at Rockefeller University in New York called
it a 'bittersweet' honour.

It is likely that Steinman died without being aware he had won
science's ultimate accolade, along with American Bruce Beutler and Jules
Hoffmann of France.

The Nobel committee does not give its awards posthumously, but has decided to make an exception because of what secretary general Goran Hansson called a 'unique situation'.

His family will certainly benefit from the unusual ruling by gaining a share of the $1.5m prize.

Steinman, originally from Montreal, Canada, whose discovery of
dendritic cells in the 1970s is key to understanding the body's next line of
defence against disease. 

'The Nobel Foundation has recognised
Ralph Steinman for his seminal discoveries concerning the body's immune
responses,' said Rockefeller University president Marc Tessier-Lavigne.

'But the news is bittersweet, as we
also learned this morning from Ralph's family that he passed a few days ago
after a long battle with cancer,' he
added.

The institution said in a statement: 'Steinman passed away on September 30. He was 68.

Beutler and Hoffmann discovered in the
1990s that receptor proteins act as a first line of defence (innate immunity)
by recognising bacteria and other micro-organisms.

Steinman's work explained
how, if required, dendritic cells in the next phase (adaptive immunity) kill
off any infections that break through.             

Understanding dendritic cells led to the
launch of the first therapeutic cancer vaccine last year, Dendreon's Provenge,
which treats men with advanced prostate cancer.

'We live in a dangerous world.
Pathogenic micro-organisms threaten us continuously,' the Nobel panel said,
describing the work over the decades in understanding our
defences.         

Medicine, or physiology, is usually the
first of the Nobel prizes awarded each year.

Prizes for achievements in
science, literature and peace were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the
will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.   

The award citation noted that the world's
scientists had long been searching for the 'gatekeepers' of immune
response.              

Hoffmann's pioneering research was
conducted on fruit flies.

It highlighted how key elements of modern human biology
have been conserved via evolution.              

The immune system exists primarily to
protect against infections but it can also protect against some cancers by
targeting rogue cells before they proliferate. 

Sometimes, however, the immune system goes
into overdrive and attacks healthy tissue, leading to autoimmune inflammatory
diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, as well as rheumatoid
arthritis.

The effect is often compared to 'friendly fire', when
troops hit their own comrades in combat.

'He was diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer four years ago, and his life was extended using a
dendritic-cell based immunotherapy of his own
design.'

Alexis Steinman, indicating that her
father had not known on his deathbed of the impending decision in Stockholm,
said: 'We are all so touched that our father's many years of hard work are
being recognised with a Nobel Prize.

'He devoted his life to his work and his
family and he would be truly
honoured.'

The Nobel award panel said in a statement in
Stockholm: 'This year's Nobel laureates have
revolutionised our understanding of the immune system by discovering key
principles for its activation.'

Before hearing the news of Steinman's death, Lars Klareskog, who chairs the
prize-giving panel, said: 'I
am very excited about what these discoveries mean.

'I think that we will have
new, better vaccines against microbes and that is very much needed now with the
increased resistance against
antibiotics.'

Beutler, 53, is based at the Scripps
Research Institute in La Jolla, California.

Luxembourg-born Hoffmann, 70,
conducted much of his work in Strasbourg.

They were supposed to share half the
10 million Swedish crowns ($1.46million) of prize-money.

The rest should have
gone to Steinman, though the unusual circumstances leave its fate now in some
doubt.

Beutler said he had learned of his
prize by e-mail and had to search online to make sure it was true: 'I
finally found it on Google News. My name was all over the
place.'      

Of his work, he said, it 'might lead
to new treatments for inflammatory and auto-immune disease and possibly new
treatments for other kinds of diseases as well'.   

The work of all three scientists has been
pivotal to the development of improved types of vaccines against infectious
diseases and novel approaches to fighting cancer.

The research has helped lay
the foundations for a new wave of 'therapeutic vaccines' that
stimulate the immune system to attack tumours.

Better understanding of the complexities
of the immune system has also given clues for treating inflammatory diseases,
such as rheumatoid arthritis, where the components of the self-defence system
end up attacking the body's own tissues.
