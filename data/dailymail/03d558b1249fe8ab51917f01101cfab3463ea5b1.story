Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond wants to hold a referendum on independence by autumn 2014

Scotland could break away from the UK within three years under plans unveiled today.

Alex Salmond hopes to declare independence within 18 months of a ‘yes’ vote in the referendum due to be held in autumn 2014.

A countdown to becoming a standalone nation would culminate with Scotland Independence Day in March 2016.

Two months later an election to a new parliament would be held, with lawmakers chosen to draw up a new constitution, which could outlaw ‘weapons of mass destruction’ in Scotland.

But critics said accused the ruling Scottish National Party of having ‘hopelessly underestimated’ the scale of creating a new country, renegotiating 14,000 international treaties and agreements.

The Holyrood government launched its Transition to an Independent Scotland today, claiming it would ensure a smooth transition to a new nation.

Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon the paper ‘provides the people of Scotland with a clear road map as to how Scotland would make the journey from a devolved system of government with the levers of power retained at Westminster, to a nation in which the powers of our national Parliament are complete and in which the people are sovereign’.

Last week the independent Electoral Commission rebuffed attempts by the SNP to use a ‘leading’ question in the referendum, warning that asking voters ‘do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country’ was designed to secure a yes vote.

Instead the question will be: ‘Should Scotland be an independent country?’

Ms Sturgeon repeated her call for talks about the process of potential independence but the UK Government has insisted there will be no pre-negotiation.

The most recent poll put support for independence at 32 per cent, while opposition stood at 47 per cent.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore, a Liberal Democrat MP, accused the Scottish Government of creating a distraction from substantive issues.

Mr Salmond and Deputy Nicola Sturgeon, published the timetable for Scotland becoming an independence nation but opponents accused them of underestimating the scale of the task

He said: ‘Once again, they are devoting their energy to the picture-frame when they don't have a painting to put in it.

‘We haven't even got a date for the referendum, let alone any detail on what independence would mean for people in areas like the economy, welfare, energy and financial services.

‘People in Scotland appreciate the benefits of remaining part of the United Kingdom family and that is why they remain strongly opposed to independence.’

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie added: ‘The SNP have hopelessly underestimated the scale and complexity of this. They would have to negotiate over 14,000 international treaties, a currency, the division of assets, membership of Nato and the host of international organisations.

‘To say they will bang all this through in just 16 months is absurd. This will give most people in Scotland the shivers and fuel suspicion that the SNP are just making it up as they go along.’

However, the SNP said the paper ‘puts pressure’ on the pro-UK campaign group, Better Together, which includes the Lib Dems, Labour and Conservatives.

Annabelle Ewing, an SNP MSP on Holyrood's Referendum Bill Committee, said: ‘The No campaign so far has done nothing except say 'No' to every positive thing that is proposed for Scotland - that is why its support has slipped since the new year, and why we now require a swing of just over 7.5 per cent for Yes to move ahead in the polls.’
