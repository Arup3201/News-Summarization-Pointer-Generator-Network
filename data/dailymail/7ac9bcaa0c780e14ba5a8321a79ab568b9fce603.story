Lee Broadbent fled to Spain's Costa del Sol and continued to operate a major cocaine supply ring is behind bars

A drugs baron who fled to the Costa del Sol and headed up a major cocaine supply ring is behind bars after he was finally arrested at a water park.

Lee Broadbent, 33, led a lavish lifestyle in Malaga as a result of his drug dealing business, selling class A substances in huge quantities.

Police observed one of his associates completing a deal to sell two kilos of cocaine with at least £259,000, and found the packages stuffed under the seat of a car.

He was eventually caught by the Spanish national police at a water park in Torremolinos after English police obtained an international arrest warrant. He was then formally charged and brought back to the UK.

The gang were today jailed for over 80 years for their part in supplying drugs in the north west of England.

Lancashire policed launched Operation Oriole in September 2011 to dismantle the gang, their supply chain and to remove potentially harmful substances from the county’s streets.

Preston Crown Court heard that as head of the crime group, Broadbent’s role was to organise the supply and distribution of cocaine in Lancashire and Greater Manchester.

In October 2011, Broadbent and one of his associates David Wignall, were seen supplying cocaine to another criminal, Gary Gairns, on a car park at Tesco in Blackpool.

A search of Gairns’ vehicle revealed a package hidden under the front passenger seat containing 1,003 grams of cocaine of 87 per cent purity, with a street value of £130,000.

Gary Gairns was subsequently arrested and charged with possession with intent to supply cocaine.

That evening, Broadbent fled the country to Malaga, Spain via Glasgow and then Belfast.

Despite being abroad, he still continued to distribute cocaine around the North West, giving orders to other drugs suppliers via pay-as-you-go mobile telephones which he believed were unlikely to be traced.

The police operation continued and one occasion Wignall was seen walking with a concealed package under his jacket after visiting an address in Blackpool. He then got into a vehicle and after a short drive, Wignall exited the car without the item.
