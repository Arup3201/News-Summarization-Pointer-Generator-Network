A baby who developed an enormous tumor in the womb - but was operated on and saved before birth - has lived to see his second birthday.

Elijah Leffingwell, who turned two in November, developed a growth on his lung while still inside his pregnant mother, April.

Surgeons said the tumor, which was three-and-a-half times larger than his head and was crushing his other organs, would surely have killed him if it had been left.

Survivor: Elijah Leffingwell, now two, survived a rare lung operation from inside the womb and has celebrated his second birthday

Premature: Elijah, pictured shortly after his premature birth, struggled to eat and also had a collapsed lung when he was born and surgery carried out while he was still in the uterus removed his hefty tumor (left) from his left lung, which was crushing the rest of his organs

April and her husband Jason instead approved a rare procedure whereby the growth was cut out of Elijah while he was still in the womb - a move which gave him a 50/50 chance of survival, according to the Daily Signal.

April said: 'At my 20-week ultrasound they saw that we had a tumor. Thinking that everything was perrfect then finding out that you have something so rare one in 30,000 and that the chance of survival was 50 per cent - it just crushed us.'

'The tumor kept growing and growing and growing - three and a half times the size of his head. It was just crushing him - he was going into heart failure, lung failure - and if we didn't do it, there was no chance.'

The family, from De Pere, Wisconsin, moved to New Jersey so they could access the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, which had specialist surgeons who could carry out the surgery.

Recovering: Due to a complication in the surgery Elijah had to eat through a tube for a year, but now thanks to therapy can take food normally - albeit with a smaller apetite

At 25 weeks Elijah underwent the surgery, during which doctors removed an orange-sized tumor from the baby's body, which scarcely weighed more than 2lbs.

However, during the surgery they inadvertently pierced his diaphragm, leaving him with a hernia which caused his chest to rupture and lung to collapse.

He was born prematurely, seven weeks before his due date, so he could be rushed to intensive care, having hardly met his parents.

By the time he was discharged, Elijah needed to eat through a tube which pumped food directly into his stomach.

Together: Elijah was born to mother April and father Jason - who went ahead with the risky surgery 

Eating: Elijah eventually learned to eat like a normal child - though he has a less fierce appetite and is fed on calorie-rich food

Although the tube has now been removed, and therapy has taught him to take food through eating, Elijah doesn't have the same appetite as most children.

To make up for it, his mom feeds him high-calorie food like avocados and peanut butter, and cuts his milk with whipping cream.

In the long term he is not expected to suffer any lasting ill effects from his difficult birth and early years - though it seems to have given him a cautious frame of mind.

April said: 'He walks through life making sure he is going to be OK.'
