Halloween celebrations are back on in a Hurricane Sandy threatened Vermont town following a flurry of complaints from parents.

The Chester Police Department decided to postpone the party for one week, saying that falling debris and other issues due to Hurricane Sandy would make it unsafe to send children door to door.

However, when the skies cleared on Wednesday morning, dozens of parents in the 3,000-person town voiced their anger at the decision and the City took back its decree.

On Monday, the Chester Police, Fire and Recreation Departments released a joint statement through the Chester Telegraph that all little ghouls and guys would have to wait a week for their annual candy feast.

'These actions are due to hurricane Sandy and the potential deadly weather that is soon to reach us with High Winds, Rain, and Flooding,' the joint statement read.

'Although we anticipate that the worst of the storm may leave us sometime Wednesday morning this storm has been very unpredictable and the after affects and cleanup will last past Wednesday Halloween with Highway and Fire crews taking care of downed trees and power lines.

They informed residents that the tradition would continue on November 7, when the public resources had the chance to recover.

'Sandy is the Grinch who stole Halloween,' Carrie Roy King wrote on the wall of the Chester Telegraph in response to the news. She was not alone.

Residents were also instructed to take
down or secure any Halloween decorations that might be damaged or cause
damage during the storm.

When
the weather passed, the parents of the small, southern Vermont town 
wanted to celebrate their good fortune with pumpkins, ghosts and 
goblins.

The city government was hit with a barrage of angry parents demanding that Halloween be reinstated. The city acquiesced.

'The Chester Services is announcing per a HIGH VOLUME of residents request that Halloween will take place tomorrow evening October 31, 2012 and the postponement date of November 7th is now canceled,' a statement from Deputy Fire Chief Matthew Wilson said.

' We do feel there may still be some inclement weather so please use caution for current weather.'

He apologized for any confusion about the festivities, adding that ' severe weather it is very hard to predict and the safety of the children and residents needs to come first.'

Several towns on the East Coast chose to beat the storm and celebrate early, like Vineland, N.J., and Kittery, Maine, according to USA Today. Last year's Tropical Storm Irene taught them a soggy lesson in preparedness.

'Every child in the city and their families want to enjoy a safe Halloween tradition without the concern, confusion or fear that a favorite holiday will be jeopardized by the storm, so we are urging neighbors to have children celebrate early in good weather, without concern for public safety issues that might arise as a result of the storm,' Gloucester, Massachusetts, Mayor Carolyn Kirk said in a written statement.

Dover, New Hampshire, and Oxford, New Jersey have opted to move the party until next week. Confusion over Halloween parties and parades has struck the entire Eastern Seaboard.

New York City's Halloween parade was cancelled for the first time in history.

Organizers of the parade said: 'We hope that everyone who would have come to the Parade is safe and that those who can volunteer to help out at one of theÂ  Emergency Outreach Centers near you. We will surely miss all of you!'

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced today that trick-or-treating in The Garden State would be postponed until Monday, November 5 after the trail of destruction left by Sandy made it dangerous for many residents to venture out into the streets.

He promised: 'If conditions are not safe on Wednesday for trick-or-treating, I will sign an executive order rescheduling.'

The New York City parade, which would have begun at 6.30pm on 6th Avenue, usually attracts up to 60,000 Halloween lovers in the most outrageous costumes.

The theme of this year's parade was 'Tick Tock', tying in with the final year of the Mayan calendar which predicts the apocalypse -- a situation some New Yorkers may say they are all too familiar with.
