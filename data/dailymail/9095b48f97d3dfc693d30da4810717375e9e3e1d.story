There are countless ways people can spy on you nowadays - from hidden microphones to Google Glass, drones and security cameras.

If this makes you feel paranoid, a firm has created a router that detects such surveillance devices and blocks them from accessing your Wi-Fi network.

Owners of the Cyborg Unplug, can also disconnect all target devices from any network they are associated with, including paired connections with phones.

Cyborg Unplug ‘sniffs’ out surveillance and undercover devices including Google Glass, hidden microphones and security cameras. Any device using the network to spy or stream content over the network are detected. An alarm is then signalled and the detected device is disconnected

Every wireless device has a unique hardware signature assigned to it by the manufacturer,

These signatures are broadcast by wireless devices as they probe for, connect to and use wireless networks.

Cyborg
 Unplug 'sniffs' the air for these signatures, looking for devices its 
owner has selected to ban.

If a banned device is discovered an alarm is 
triggered.

Further,
 if that device is found to be connected to a network that Cyborg Unplug
 is trained to guard, a stream of special 'de-authentication' signals 
(packets) are sent to disconnect it.

It does this automatically, without any interaction required from its owner.

‘Every wireless device has a unique hardware signature assigned to it by the manufacturer,’ explained developer Julian Oliver.

‘These signatures are broadcast by wireless devices as they probe for, connect to and use wireless networks.

Cyborg Unplug can be operated in two modes The recommended mode is Territory Mode, disconnecting target devices, such as drones (stock image pictured) from selected networks owned and operated by the user. All Out Mode disconnects detected devices from any network they are associated with

An alarm is signalled when a device is detected, and the target equipment is disconnected from the network automatically, by Cyborg Unplug.

Alarms can be triggered either using an audio sound, or through flashing LEDs and features will depend on the model bought.

Cyborg Unplug can be operated in two modes.

The recommended mode is Territory Mode, disconnecting target devices from selected networks owned and operated by the user.

The other mode is All Out Mode, which disconnects all detected target devices from any network they are associated with, including paired connections with smartphones. 

The router also lets owners block specific devices, while allowing others. For example, during set up phase, owners can choose to allow smartphones to access the network, but not Google Glass devices (pictured)

Cyborg Unplug isn’t a ‘jammer’. A jammer disrupts all signals within a given distance, while Cyborg Unplug detects and targets a specific device and only disconnects that specific gadget.

The firm said Cyborg Unplug isn't designed for use in cases where there is already strict control over who uses the local wireless network, in a home, for example.

Instead, it has been created for networks used by lots of people, in a school, office or restaurant for example, that either provides an open network, or gives customers passwords.

The router also lets owners block specific devices, while allowing others.

For example, during set up phase, owners can choose to allow smartphones to access the network, but not Google Glass devices.

Two models will be initially available, later this year, priced between $50 (£30) and $100 (£60)

Cyborg Unplug will ship to the EU, UK and US, with other locations being added after launch.
