When Apple named its latest lightning connector it may have been more pioneering than first thought as a team of scientists have now used the power of a firebolt to charge a mobile phone. 

Researchers from Southampton University used an alternating current, powered by a transformer, and were able to recreate a bolt of electricity by passing 200,000 volts across an 11-inch gap.

This generated the same heat, light and charge produced by a bolt of lighting, which was then used to charge the battery on a Nokia 925 phone.

A team of scientists from Southampton
 University used an alternating current, powered by a transformer.

They used this to recreate a bolt of electricity by passing 200,000 volts 
across an 11-inch gap.

This
 generated the same heat, light and charge produced by a bolt of 
lighting. 

The charge was then passed through a second, controlling transformer, that connected to the phone's battery.

It took just a single bolt to charge the phone.

'For most of us, lightning can be a truly
 terrifying, powerful and awe-inspiring force of nature.

'But boffins from Nokia and the University of 
Southampton put their heads together to try and tame the beast,' said Phil B on the Nokia Conversations blog.

'They 
succeeded, and in a world’s first they were able to use simulated 
lightning to charge a Nokia phone.'

Neil Palmer from the university passed the extremely high voltage across a gap between two conducting tubes in order to generate the bolt.

The charge was then passed through a second, controlling transformer, connected to the phone's battery.

'We were amazed to see that 
the Nokia circuitry somehow stabilised the noisy signal, allowing the 
battery to be charged' added Palmer.

'This discovery proves that the device 
can be charged with a current that passes through the air, and is a huge
 step towards understanding a natural power like lightning and 
harnessing its energy.'

Lightning is created from static 
electricity that forms when the balance of the electric charge between a cloud and the earth is disrupted. This disruption occurs during storms, as clouds move and fill with rain.

Simulated lightning is touted as an alternative power source in places where electricity is scarce.

However, Nokia sales boss Chris Weber said: 'We aren’t recommending people try this experiment at home.'
