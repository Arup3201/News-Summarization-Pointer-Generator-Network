What would Osborne say? The Chancellor's former speech writer has been given a caution

George Osborne's former speech writer has been cautioned for drunkenly rowing with bouncers during a brawl outside a cocktail bar.

Mario Thomas Pisani, an aide to Chancellor Mr Osborne and number three in the Treasury press office, was cautioned on Wednesday after he admitted the public order offence.

The 34-year-old was due to stand trial at Lavender Hill Magistrates Court today accused of behaviour 'likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress under Section 5 of the Public Order Act'.

His name was listed among matters to appear this morning.

But proceedings were dropped after he attended a south London police station on Wednesday to come clean.

Pisani of Battersea, was involved in a row that broke out at the Adventure Bar in Battersea, South West London in the early hours of November 10 last year.

He was accused of drunkenly abusing bouncers during the disturbance and at an earlier hearing had denied the charge.

Ten witnesses - seven for the prosecution and three for the defence - were due to give evidence.

But today at Lavender Hill a court clerk said: 'This matter had been withdrawn. He has already admitted his guilt and received a caution.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed this, adding: 'He received a caution on Wednesday at a South London police station.'

The row happened outside The Adventure cocktail bar, but Pisani initially denied the charge

Pisani was suspended from his £50,000 a year job while the investigation was carried out.

A Treasury Press office spokesman today refused to comment on the case or say whether he had been reinstated in his role.

A 28 year old woman was cautioned shortly after the same incident for assaulting a female police officer.
