If you sleep with your phone under your pillow, or check Facebook before doing anything else in the morning, you may have an unhealthy ‘digital diet.’

A team of Californian developers has created an app that helps people track how much they use their phones, and specific apps - and weans themselves off, if necessary.

Called QualityTime, it works in the background to monitor how many times a screen is unlocked, how long someone spends playing certain games, or which apps they open the most.

QualityTime works in the background to monitor smartphone and app usage. It tracks how many times a screen is unlocked, which apps users open the most, and shows a daily timeline (pictured left). The free Android app also shows how much time is spent on individual apps over the course of a week (pictured right)

Users can also switch off from their smartphone completely by choosing to lock their screen for set periods of time.

The app was created by cloud desktop firm ZeroDesktop. 

President and co-founder of ZeroDesktop Richard Sah said: ‘Smartphone use has become so widely integrated into our everyday lives, it’s difficult for people to realise just how frequently and compulsively they use their phones.

‘If you asked me whether I'm addicted to my smartphone, I would say absolutely not.

'Then I discovered that I spend three hours a day on my phone simply out of habit.’

QualityTime reveals smartphone and app use both in terms of frequency and duration, meaning users can spot habits and trends.

Alerts will sound if usage exceeds a certain amount of time, and the app can be connected to smart household gadgets such as lights, to flash warnings instead. The app summarises information into daily or weekly phone use including total app usage, phone unlock frequency, and detailed reporting - known as a ‘digital diet’

Users can also choose to ‘Take a Break’, at which point the app will lock the screen and prevent them using the phone for a set amount of time

It also shows how often a user unlocks their phone, how often they open a certain app, or a certain time of day usage is  high.

The app summarises this information into daily or weekly timelines, including total app usage, phone unlock frequency, and detailed reporting - known as a ‘digital diet’.

Users can also create alert notifications on the app, or via connected gadgets such as smart lights, when they exceed a certain time using the phone or app.

They can also choose to ‘Take a Break’, at which point the app will lock the screen and prevent them from using the phone until a set amount of time has passed.

The phone can still be used for emergencies during this time.

And, achievements can be shared on Twitter and Facebook.

‘Whether you’ve managed to avoid Candy Crush Saga for a whole week, or just broke your own personal record for watching films on Netflix, you can choose to tweet or Facebook your specific stats and compare with friends,’ added Mr Sah. 

ZeroDesktop has previously created controls apps and software for school and preschools.

‘We’ve all noticed that habitual phone-checking is the norm - whether you’re bored, tired, eating dinner or chatting to friends,’ said chief architect at ZeroDesktop Frank Pesek

‘In 2017, more than half the population of the world will own a smartphone, and so this is a phenomenon that will continue to grow.

'We are always looking for new ways to help people understand their digital diet and use their time effectively.’

QualityTime is a free app available from Google Play. 

The company has not announced when an iOS version will be released. 

Dr Richard Graham runs a technology addiction programme at London's Capio Nightingale Hospital.

He suggests beginning with a controlled  withdrawal, which may start with a few days of complete abstinence followed by a controlled reintroduction.

After the initial 72-hour detox, the treatment varies according to the severity of the case and the level of adaption. 

Initially, Dr Graham said people will show distress and signs of withdrawal, much like any addict would feel. 

'The challenge starts when we reintroduce technology back into their lives in a controlled manner, as technology is an integral part of our everyday lives it is important that a good relationship habit is established,' he said.

Establishing a maximum daily time allowance is also a good place to start, as well as strict times of abstinence. 

Techniques include leaving a phone off or on silent at meal times, and when with friends and family. 

Dr Graham continued that it is especially important for sleep hygiene that iPads and iPhones are not used before bed. 

This means keeping them in a different room overnight to stop both parents and children from using technology straight before, during and after sleep. 

The hospital offers an online test that assesses the extent of a person's relationship with technology.
