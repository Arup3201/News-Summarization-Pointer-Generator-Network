You spend half an hour putting on your make-up only to sweat it off, do your squats wrong so he'll come adjust your pose and you've spent a fortune on tight new gym gear.

Oh dear, fancy your personal trainer? We've all been there. Including Madonna. And rumour has it, Kym Marsh has now got the hots for hers.

But as one of Britain's top PTs reveals, as long as you're training together, it's best to keep things in the gym and out of the bedroom...

You can't deny Andy's a tasty dish, but Diane had to hold off until their gym sessions ended

By Andy McGlynn, Director of Lifestyle Fitness Personal Training, lsfpt.co.uk and the UK's leading trainer of Personal Trainers.

'During my many years in the business unfortunately I can recount many a tale of personal trainers becoming romantically involved with their clients, and an unsurprisingly 99 per cent of the time it does not end in a loving, lasting relationship.

'If you do become attracted to your client, and vice versa, the only way to pursue it is to terminate the professional contract as soon as you realise you have developed feelings for the other person. 

'I first met my now partner, Diane (Jet from Gladiators) when I became her PT.

'It was only later, once we had finished training together that we pursued a personal relationship. I have no doubt that if we had continued our personal trainer and client relationship whilst embarking on something romantic, it would have failed on both counts.

'It's such a cliché and any 
career-minded PT would never cross that line at work so it's really 
frustrating to see the latest headlines about personal trainer Matt 
Baker allegedly 'finding romance' with his client, Coronation Street's 
Kym Marsh. 

Once again the actions of a minority threaten to undermine 
the credibility of our industry.

'I have been in the personal trainer management business for 12 years and have trained over 1,000 individuals.

'The average age is 26 and so it's quite a young, vibrant industry but there is one very strict rule for every single person I train - 'no sex with clients' - and anyone refusing to agree will be shown the door without exception.

'In the capacity of personal trainer you are being entrusted with your client's health and well-being, and to take advantage of that whilst they're in your care is unacceptable.

'If a patient started seeing their doctor or physician it would be at the very least frowned upon, and would no doubt cause outrage among his peers and other patients, yet it seems the same rules don't apply to our industry.

'There is a stigma around personal trainers and their female clients and there's a tendency to treat it as a bit of a joke. 

But it's something that not only breaks up marriages, but also casts our industry in a somewhat seedy light. I've worked tirelessly in my career to drive up the credibility of personal training, but this type of behaviour playing out in the media with celebrities and their trainers totally undermines that.

'The problem with so many male personal trainers having relationships with their clients is that it's normally habitual - it becomes the way for them to meet women and the pattern ends up replaying itself over and over again.

'The standing joke in one gym I know is 
that if you sign up for sessions with one particular trainer, you 
automatically sign up for an affair! 

hat guy must have some angry 
husbands after him, not to mention the trail of ‘heartbroken' women he's
 leaving behind. 

'But this is the problem. More often than not the 
relationship is being treated much more seriously by one party than the 
other. A sure sign of this is if the attraction is purely lust-driven 
and there is little to no romance or effort being made outside the gym.

'Of course, sometimes there will be more to it than just a spark of sexual chemistry and it may be that you have met your potential soul-mate in your PT.

'If this is the case the only way for a personal relationship to succeed is if it becomes genuine and the professional training contract is terminated immediately. The couple are then free to get to know each other as with any other potential partner and it removes any need for secrecy or deceit, which are not the foundations for a healthy partnership. 

'If the trainer is serious about the relationship he won't want to jeopardise either his career or a possible future with the client, so he will instigate a termination in the contract. 

'Sadly though this rarely happens in my experience and it tends to be a fling, an affair or a fumble in the sunbed room or car park.

'I have come across these types of affairs and they do typically end the same way - with the personal trainer coming to see me sheepishly asking for advice on how he can extricate himself from the situation, and the client is often left feeling humiliated.

'So, why does it happen? Clients are attracted to the stereotypical fit-looking male personal trainer. Typically he will lavish her with compliments about her body week in and week out. 

That attention often fills a gap - giving her the sort of attention that she might not be receiving elsewhere. 

Before you know it, it's turned into something romantic or sexual. 

'I operate a very strict policy in my organisation - the client and the client's partner has to feel happy and reassured that the service is professional and focused on what it should be. If one of my personal trainers refuses to adhere to these rules, they are out.

'Twelve years of personal training management experience behind me and I believe my policy is the only option.'
