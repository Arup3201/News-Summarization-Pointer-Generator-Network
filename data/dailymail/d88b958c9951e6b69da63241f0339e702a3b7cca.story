You have to fear for Manchester United with a hurricane on the way. Louis van Gaal’s defence is about as far from being storm-proofed as it’s possible to be after spending more than £160million on home improvements.

Daley Blind did manage to scramble a point three minutes from time, but twice West Bromwich Albion led with a reminder that it will take more than a two-week break, another minor tactical tweak and a bold decision to leave out Radamel Falcao to stop United springing leaks.

Until they solve such fundamental problems they will remain thrilling to watch but firmly on the outside of the title race.

Alan Irvine’s spirited team had only two efforts on target according to the statistics but they gave their visitors a real scare, as first Stephane Sessegnon and then Saido Berahino took advantage of loose defending to beat David de Gea.

United recovered and will take certain positives from the night, including Marouane Fellaini’s first goal since his £27.5m move from Everton last year. It could be the initial stage of his rehabilitation from figure of fun to cult hero.

There was also Blind’s first since his transfer from Ajax in August and, as it came in the closing moments, a return to United’s never-say-die traditions.

And yet, they have not won away from home since April, they have only won three of the first eight Barclays Premier League games and they trail 11 points behind leaders Chelsea.

Jose Mourinho’s team are at Old Trafford on Sunday. 'Different cook, as we say in the Netherlands,' said Van Gaal, at The Hawthorns, to a room full of blank stares. 'Different biscuit?' he ventured. Still nothing. 'Different level?'.

The Dutch phrase seems to mean Chelsea will provide a far tougher test of United’s progress than anything they have faced to date. After Chelsea, it is a derby against Manchester City. And still Van Gaal tinkers, unable to find the right balance.

At The Hawthorns, there was a first start of the season for Adnan Januzaj as the midfield diamond followed the back-three out of the window and United adopted a 4-1-4-1 shape.

Blind was deployed as the holding midfielder, although he was unable to stop Sessegnon sweeping Albion into the lead from the area he should have been patrolling. Sessegnon’s movement was intelligent, delaying his charge into the penalty area to elude the centre-halves as Andre Wisdom tore forward from right-back.

Luke Shaw had been lured in-field to contest a high ball but Albion won it and Graeme Dorrans released Wisdom. De Gea, who performed heroics to protect the lead against Everton, on the last outing, had no chance and Sessegnon lashed the ball past him from the edge of the box.

West Bromwich Albion looked to have earned all three points against Manchester United when Saido Berahino finished off this fine move in the second half. Click here for more from our brilliant Match Zone. 

Shaw seems uncertain when asked to defend in this team, as a far more experienced left-back might. Marcos Rojo, United’s left-sided centre-half, appeared equally as uncomfortable at times, especially when confronted with the direct and intense elements of English football.

Albion were quick to launch the ball into Rojo’s airspace and to run at Shaw, too often for it to be a coincidence.

Going forward, of course, United were mobile, dangerous and kept Boaz Myhill on his toes. Angel di Maria was the greatest threat in the first half but ran out of steam and came off after gesturing as if he might have a problem with his groin.

Myhill, deputising for Ben Foster who was out with a calf injury, denied stand-in skipper Robin van Persie within and then again to frustrate Di Maria twice, in the first half.

Albion scrambled around to protect their goal. They defended stoutly, throwing bodies in front of shots, but were helped by wayward finishing, which had United’s chief executive Ed Woodward grumbling in the VIP seats.

Van Gaal replaced Ander Herrera with Fellaini at half-time and his team were soon level. Fellaini levelled when he took a deep cross from Di Maria on his chest, held off Lescott and lashed the ball high past Myhill with his left foot.

United pressed on for the winner. The introduction of Fellaini was not the only change Van Gaal made at half-time. His team pressed further up the field after the break, which seemed to help, but encouraged Albion on the break and they went ahead when Chris Brunt unzipped the defence with a pass in the 65th minute.

Berahino collected it and the 20-year-old made no mistake, with a lethal finish to celebrate his seventh of the season in all competitions.

Again United risked throwing everything forward. Van Persie smacked the foot of the post and Sebastien Pocognoli escaped with a clear handball inside his own penalty area.

West Brom’s luck ran out as Blind salvaged a point, seizing on a partial clearance as it rolled out of the penalty area and guided it coolly inside the post. Heartbreak for Albion but United, however dreadful at the back, probably deserved their point for their adventure.

Different biscuit? It’s the way the cookie crumbles.
