U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who spent five years as a Taliban prisoner of war before being released last month, was being informed of the media attention surrounding his return as he recovers at a military hospital, the Army said on Tuesday.

Bergdahl arrived in the predawn hours of Friday at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, on a military flight from Germany, dogged by questions surrounding his disappearance from a U.S. Army post in Afghanistan and the deal the Obama administration reached to free him.

Inquiry: A General is due to begin an investigation into the capture of Bowe Bergdahl, believed to be the man circled. The 28-year-old was flown to a Texas base, above, on Friday

Briefing: In their short briefing, the military said that Bergdahl will gradually be shown media reports abou his disappearance

'He is 
gradually being provided media coverage about him,' Colonel Hans Bush, a
 reintegration mission spokesman for U.S. Army South, said in a brief 
statement.

Bush said Bergdahl is yet to be reunited with his parents and that he will decide when he wants to see them.

'He
 has acclimated to his time change from Germany. He is eating and 
sleeping on a routine schedule. His debriefings and medical care 
continue,' Bush said.

The
 U.S. military said on Monday it had begun an investigation into 
Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance in Afghanistan, with no time set for its 
completion.

While
 the Army also gave little information about Bergdahl's health and 
emotional state, officials said they were pleased with his physical 
state on arrival.

The
 military hospital in San Antonio where Bergdahl has been receiving what
 the Army calls 'reintegration' treatment has teams of specialists and 
has been helping returning prisoners of war for decades.

Background: The investigation will look at what led to Bergdahl, pictured with a Taliban fighter before he was freed last month, leaving his base in Afghanistan and being held captive for five years

Steps to recovery: After being rescued, above, Bergdahl was taken to a hospital on a US Air Base in Germany

Bergdahl
 was handed over to U.S. forces in Afghanistan on May 31 in exchange for
 five Taliban leaders held at the Guantanamo prison in Cuba. His release
 initially sparked a wave of support that was quickly overshadowed by a 
political uproar over the freeing of the senior Taliban members.

Lawmakers
 criticized the Obama administration for failing to give them 30 days' 
notice before transferring prisoners from Guantanamo as required by law.

Some
 charged that in making the exchange, the administration had effectively
 violated its policy against negotiating with terrorists.

Some
 of Bergdahl's former comrades in Afghanistan alleged he had deserted 
when he walked away from his post, in circumstances that are unclear, 
and was later captured.

'The skills he used to survive his five-year ordeal may not be healthy now,' General Joseph DeSalvo said.

As he continues his rehabilitation at the Army medical center in San Antonio, Texas, the investigation into his disappearance will get under way.

Part of it will examine what led to Bergdahl leaving his base, which resulted in his capture.

An investigation at the time concluded that he had left of his own free will, but a military official has told CNN the Army has no definitive proof that he deserted.

Bergdahl has not yet been reunited with his parents. It is not unusual for former hostages to delay meeting close friends and family, as it can be an emotional strain.Â 

Army life: Bergdahl, left, was a member of Blackfoot Company, 1st 
Battalion 501st infantry Regiment

Overjoyed: Bergdahl's parents, Jani and Bob, pictured with Obama, have not been reunited with their son

A spokesman for his parents, Bob and Jani, said they were overjoyed that he had returned to the U.S.

They are waiting for the right moment to visit their son, who is currently being cared for by a specially trained team who have been preparing for his return since he was first taken hostage.
