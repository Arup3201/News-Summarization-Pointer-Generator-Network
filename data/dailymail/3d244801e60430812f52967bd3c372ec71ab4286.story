A woman was badly burnt when her electronic cigarette exploded in the middle of the night - because it was plugged into her phone charger.

Lucy May, 22, was in bed asleep in the early hours of Tuesday morning when her e-cigarette suddenly burst into flames.

The electronic device blew up after being plugged into an Apple USB socket - only meant for charging iPhones and iPads.

Lucy May, 22, says she could have been killed in a fire started by a e-cigarette at her home in west Wales

Shocked Miss May woke up to find her bed was on fire and she later had to be treated in hospital after suffering burns to her legs.

Miss May fears she could have killed if she hadn’t woken up in time - and is now warning people not to use phone chargers for e-cigarettes.

Office manager Miss May said: 'I had my e-cigarette on charge and went to sleep - next thing I knew I woke up to a fire.

'The flames were crackling and roaring on my duvet and dressing table, I jumped out of bed and threw a suitcase over them.

'If I had been asleep for five more minutes I would have burned to death.

'I would say to people not to use a phone charger. With USBs you assume they are universal for any gadget - but that is dangerous.'

Miss May is now warning others not to make the same mistake she did and check instructions of e-cigarettes

Miss May, of Tenby, Pembrokeshire, has been trying to quit smoking since last year and bought two e-cigarettes for £35 in a local market.

She put the silver eGo e-cigarette on charge at her home after returning from a weekend away.

But it is thought the Apple USB socket she used was too powerful for the e-cigarette to cope with.

She said it 'exploded like a bullet', sending four foot flames blazing around the bedroom of her £570,000 detached house.

'The flames were crackling and roaring on my duvet and dressing table, I jumped out of bed and threw a suitcase over them.'

Miss May woke up at 1am and began screaming and shouting 'fire, fire,' waking her father and twin sister Leila.

Leila, who lives at the house with her two children, called 999 and fire crews soon arrived at the scene.

Miss May, who was covered in melted plastic, was rushed to Morriston Hospital in Swansea, where she was treated for third degree burns to her hands, legs and the bottom of her abdomen.

The blaze caused hundreds of pounds of damage to her duvet, bag and clothing as well as leaving scorch marks on the bedroom wall.

Her family are now urging anyone with an electronic cigarette to check charging instructions carefully, particularly when using USB chargers.

A Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'The fire was contained to a first floor bedroom.

'Fire crews used two breathing apparatus, one hose reel jet, thermal imaging camera, and a hydrant outside. One female was treated by paramedics for smoke inhalation and minor burns.'

Electronic cigarette company eGo declined to comment on the incident.

The
 latest incident comes after fire crews investigating a fire
 in East London earlier this year said they believe the blaze was started by an 
e-cigarette on charge.

More
 than 20 firefighters tackled the fire in a ground floor flat in Barking
 and rescued a woman, who was taken to hospital with smoke inhalation 
and shock.

Fire
 chiefs investigating the incident said they believe an e-cigarette 
could have overheated while it was plugged into a mains socket.

London fire chiefs believe this e-cigarette charger may have been behind a blaze in Barking

In April this year, a pensioner was engulfed in flames on a ward at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester in another incident.

It is believed 65-year-old Jean Booth used an e-cigarette while she was on oxygen in her hospital bed and was left badly burned.

Just
 two weeks earlier, an e-cigarette exploded in a barmaid's face while it
 was being charged near the bar of a pub in Richmond, North Yorkshire.

Laura Baty, 18, managed to quickly turn away from the flames  - but was left with a burnt dress and a injured arm.

Following
 the spate of incidents, fire investigator Charlie Pugsley said: 'People
 assume e-cigarettes are much safer than ordinary cigarettes, and in 
most cases they are.

'The
 danger is that people sometimes use incorrect chargers which runs the 
risk of over-charging, which can potentially have explosive results.'
