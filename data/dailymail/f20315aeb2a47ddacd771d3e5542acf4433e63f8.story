Mauricio Pochettino insists his struggling Tottenham side are being inhibited by the size of the White Hart Lane pitch, and that it is partly to blame for the team losing three of their five home league games this season.

The Spurs boss, who watched his side lose at home to Newcastle on Sunday, believes the narrow pitch is making it easier for opposing teams to sit deep and soak up pressure.

According to Premier League figures quoted in the Telegraph, Spurs' pitch is one of the smallest in the Premier League, with only QPR and Stoke playing on smaller surfaces. Pochettino's former club Southampton  play on the joint-largest  pitch in the division.

Prior to Tottenham's Capital One Cup fourth-round clash against Brighton on Wednesday, Pochettino explained why he feels his team are being handicapped by the White Hart Lane pitch. 

The former Saints boss said: 'Our style means we need a bigger place to play because we play a positional game and it's true that White Hart Lane is a little bit tight.

'It's better for the opponent. For example, on Sunday Newcastle play deep, same with West Brom and Liverpool, and it was difficult for us. We need time to adapt in our new set-up and understand better our position on the pitch.'

Pochettino's argument might carry a bit more weight if his side had fared better on their travels, but Spurs have been equally limp away from home. 

They have one win from four fixtures on the road, and that was at West Ham, who play on the seventh-smallest pitch in the division.

Tottenham's other away days have included a disappointing 2-2 draw with Sunderland (joint-biggest) and a 4-1 loss at Manchester City (also joint-biggest).

The only result that really bears out Pochettino's claim that his side operate better on a a bigger pitch is the commendable 1-1 stalemate at Arsenal, whose Emirates Stadium pitch is one of the joint-largest in the Premier League.

But even that outcome could be seen to contradict the Argentine's argument as the large Emirates surface was designed to make it harder for visiting teams to sit deep and deny the Gunners space - precisely what Tottenham did in the match. 

Arsenal moved their home Champions League games to Wembley in 1998 and played on a bigger pitch

Arsenal's large playing surface is a far cry from the compactness of their old  Highbury ground, which was part of the reason they  took  the extraordinary step of moving their Champions League home games to Wembley for the 1998-99 and 1999-00 seasons.

Although the decision was primarily financially motivated, the Gunners felt their expansive game was undermined by Highbury's relatively small dimensions, offering a precedent to Pochettino's complaints.

The Highbury pitch had  measurements of 100m long x 67m wide (the same as White Hart Lane) compared to Wembley's 105m x 69m. 

Stadium:mk, where Spurs may temporarily move to while their new ground is being built, is larger than White Hart Lane, at 105x68m.

Pochettino did not attribute his team's indifferent form solely to the size of the White Hart Lane pitch though, and admitted that the team needs to improve its mental strength.

The Argentine manager admitted that his team need to display more resilience.

He said: 'I think we are the psychologists. The players want to hear the manager and the staff, the assistant manager, the goalkeeper coach. We can help them.

'In my career always, when I was a player, we had a lot of meetings, just the players for good and bad things. Maybe here, it's not the habit. We tried to push that because it's important sometimes that the players have different meetings with the captain to realise some different situations. The players can always improve in their own meetings.

Harry Kane is in line to start against Brighton on Wednesday after his Europa League hat-trick last week 

Brighton drew 1-1 with Rotherham on Saturday and are a lowly 21st in the Championship 

'We did a lot of work in groups, and as individuals. In the training ground, in meeting rooms, in my personal office, in different areas. But always you need more time to change the habits. We talk about mentalities and changing habits.

'The mental process is always more slow than the physical or tactical. We are in a good way, I think our job does not reflect in the table. This is maybe a difficult period, but it is the process we have to go through.'

Pochettino is expected to hand a start to Harry Kane for the visit of Brighton on Wednesday, after the striker was dropped for the Newcastle clash despite scoring a hat-trick three days earlier against Asteras Tripoli in the Europa League.
