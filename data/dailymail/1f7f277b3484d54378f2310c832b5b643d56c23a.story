An embarrassing slip of the tongue live on air on Tuesday left a CNN International anchor red-faced and flustered after he mistakenly said ‘dildo’ when he meant to say ‘dodo.’

Jonathan Mann was hosting a segment about the impact of climate change on animal species when he decided to offer up an example of previous ‘man-made extinctions’.

‘We hunted the dildo into extinction,’ said Mann, before a split second later realizing that he had mistakenly mixed up a sex toy with an extinct bred of bird.

‘Um, but, the Dodo, rather, forgive me, I’m having trouble with my words today,’ he blurted out, no double with his producer screaming into his earpiece.

The Dodo was of course a flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, which become extinct some time during the 17th century.

The CNN International clip also caught the attention of Tuesday night’s ‘Late Night With David Letterman’ who poked fun at CNN’s status as the ‘most-trusted name in news.’
