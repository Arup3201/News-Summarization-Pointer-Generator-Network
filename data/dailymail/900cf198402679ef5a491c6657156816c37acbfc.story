The numbers of men taking part weren't quite the same, but the result was: the Brits gave the French a damn good hiding.

One hundred and 98 years since Napoleon Bonaparte was finally defeated at the Battle of Waterloo, a spectacular re-enactment has been held to remember it.

Around 3,000 part-time actors and history enthusiasts from 18 
countries descended on the site in a wheat field south of Brussels yesterday to take part in the event.

From the buttons on their uniforms down 
to the blades on their bayonets, every element of the battle was 
accurately reconstructed.

After two hours of re-enacting the 
slaughter of 9,500 men through hand-to-hand combat and fusillades, 
Wellington's men emerged victorious through the plumes of smoke.

There are large-scale 
re-enactments every year, with people from all walks of life joining forces to fight the Battle of Waterloo.

On
 June 18, 1815, Napoleon led his 72,000-strong army into battle with 
120,000 Allied soldiers on the gently rolling plateau of Waterloo in 
Belgium. The Allied army was a coalition of British, Dutch, German, 
Belgian and Prussian soldiers.

The Duke of Wellington's men open fire at the Battle of Waterloo re-enactment

The two sides remained in a bloody 
embrace for several hours, but at the end of the afternoon the French 
emperor's Great Army was defeated by the Duke of Wellington and Field 
Marshal Blucher, commander of the Prussian army.

Earlier this week it emerged the 
Government is refusing to mark the battle’s 200th anniversary in 2015 
amid suspicions it does not want to offend France.

That
 decision is in stark contrast to Belgium - where the clash took place. 
The government in Brussels is spending at least £20million on 
commemorative events, including restoring the battlefield.

Instead, there will only be ‘initiatives’ at military museums and ‘some commemorative activity’ at the Duke’s former homes.

The
 decision also contrasts with the major events organised to mark the 
200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in 2007 which 
involved an apology on behalf of the nation by then prime minister Tony 
Blair.

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has told 
the bicentenary campaign group Waterloo 200 that he will not help. The 
Government has also declined to hand over a single penny for any events.

James Morrow, secretary of Waterloo 
200, which is organising commemorations including a service at St Paul’s
 and a re-enactment of the Waterloo Despatch, where British troops 
travelled with three captured French troops to London to tell the King 
of victory, said he was 'disappointed'.

Born in 1769, Napoleon seized power in a coup in 1799 and became first consul

Derided by the English as nothing more than a tyrant, Napoleon Bonaparte remains a celebrated figure in France.

Born in 1769, the great leader seized power in a coup in 1799 and became first consul.

He defeated the Austrians at Marengo before negotiating peace on the continent in 1803 and establishing French dominance.

But it is the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 that he is remembered for in Britain.

The British - led by Lord Nelson aboard HMS Victory - secured a decisive victory over a French and Spanish coalition.

Although the British officer secured a decisive victory he was shot dead while on deck.

Beaten by the Brits, Napoleon turned his attention back to the continent and secured arguably his, and France's, greatest military victory the same year.

In the Battle of Austerlitz the Russo-Austrian army were decisively defeated. The battle, fought in what is now the Czech Republic, saw the French gain a lot of new territory.

It was the Peninsular War, which began in 1808, with Portugal, Spain and the UK, which was ultimately to prove his undoing. After being defeated in a battle in Moscow in 1812, Paris fell in 1814 after a series of disastrous French defeats.

After going into exile, he regained power briefly in 1815 only to be defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. Following the Duke of Wellington's victory, Napoleon abdicated.

He was imprisoned by the British and died in custody in 1821.
