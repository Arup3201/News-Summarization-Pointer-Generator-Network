Kammer the chameleon will have to say at least ten scale Marys after this devout display of piety.

The religious reptile showed his true colours this week when he reached out to confess to a figurine of St Francis.

The shade-shifting lizard, from Oklahoma, suddenly seemed overcome by a sense of his own mortality as he sat down to tuck into his dinner of praying mantis ... so he said a little prayer of his own.

He reached out his claws to the eight-inch statuette of the patron saint of animals - and then climbed on top of its head.

Say three scale Mary's: Kammer the chameleon was being fed by owner Scott Cromwell when he decided he couldn't wait to get closer to God

Penitent: He reached out his claws in prayer to an eight-inch high statue of the patron saint of animals

Owner Scott Cromwell, 43, said his pet was far more interested in celebrating the holy man than in the mantis he was given to eat.

The TV repairman, who was in his lounge in Oklahoma, said: 'When he saw my St Francis figure, Kammer immediately reached out to him.

Nearer to heaven: When he had finished his act of penitence, he then climbed onto St Francis' head

'I grabbed my camera to catch a few photos of him praying to the statue like a devout believer.

'I guessed he might move onto the ornament to be closer to him, and sure enough he did.

'After I got a couple shots of him on top of the statue I took him off, but he looked very content and probably would have sat there for quite some time.

'Deciding which is my favourite image is proving to be as difficult as deciding on his name.

'At first, I liked the photo of him grabbing the statue's hand the best, but now I think I prefer him reaching out to him with his arms wide open.

'I have a great love of animals and what St. Francis stands for, so the way these came together makes me feel good.'
