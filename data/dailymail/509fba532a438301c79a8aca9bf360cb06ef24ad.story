A kindhearted stranger who comforted a dying woman after she was knocked from her scooter by a car has delivered her farewell message to her mother.

Angel Quiles saw 21-year-old Susie Stone driving along a road in Dunedin, Florida at 10pm on Thursday when the driver of a jeep turned into her path without seeing her.

Quiles, whose wife and unborn baby miraculously survived a car crash just weeks ago, said the woman was thrown into a ditch - and he knew he had to be there for someone else's loved one.

He ran over to her side and prayed with her.

Kindness of strangers: Angel Quiles, 35, saw a young woman being hit by a jeep last Thursday and ran to her side. She told him to tell her mother that she was going to be OK and to give her a hug

Loss: Susie Stone, 21, passed away on Thursday night after a driver failed to see her and knocked her down

'All she said after I prayed with her was, "Tell my mom I'm going to be OK, and give her a hug for me",' Quiles, 35, told WPTV.

'I just began to cry when I saw her take her last breath,' he said, becoming emotional.

On Friday, he met with Stone's heartbroken parents to comfort them and pass on her dying wish. 

'I told her, "Sorry, I wish I could have done more",' said Quiles. 'She said that Susie's a beautiful girl who loved life.'

Stone's mother said that she was glad her daughter had an angel by her side.

Just weeks before the tragic crash, Stone, a waitress and actress, had taken to her Facebook page to express her gratitude for life.

'I love life,' she wrote on October 25. 'And all involved. Music. People. Dancing. Coffee. Bad decisions. Good decisions. Perfect moments of synchronicity.

'I love me. I love all I've done this year. I love all the things I've lost. They've given me so much in return. Good "morning". It's a beautiful day out. And I'm feeling good.'

The Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office said that drugs, alcohol and reckless driving were not factors in the crash and that the driver, 24-year-old Taylor Roppolo, has not been charged.

The crash came just three weeks after Quiles' wife Jenny was struck by a tow truck as she crossed a road in St Petersburg to go to a doctor's appointment.

Scene: Quiles returned to the ditch where he found Stone and recounted how he prayed with her

She was 33 weeks pregnant at the time but both she and her baby survived after she reportedly turned her body to protect her stomach.

Two weeks later, the little girl, Emmi, was born early and has since gone home, but Quiles' wife remains in hospital for treatment for traumatic brain injury, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

The driver, Shaun Downing, has been issued a traffic citation for failing to yield to a pedestrian and will have to pay a fine, but he did nothing criminal, investigators concluded.

The Quiles family has set up a gofundme page to raise funds for Jenny's medical care.
