Tragedy: Lisa Williamson, pictured with her husband Darren, died after she was found  in a toilet at the BoomTown festival, near Winchester, Hampshire, on Saturday. At the opening of her inquest today the cause of death was given as hanging

Police are trying to piece together the hours leading up to her death and are carrying out tests to see if she had taken drugs.

The
 31-year-old beauty therapist and her husband are understood to have 
left their young son and daughter with relatives so they could attend 
BoomTown Fair festival.

It 
is the second year in a row that a woman has died at the festival, which
 is held at the Matterley Estate, near Winchester in Hampshire.

Last
 night Mr Williamson, 33, who works for a building contractor, and the 
children were being comforted by relatives at the family home in 
Bromyard, Herefordshire.

Festival site: The 31-year-old had attended the event, at the Matterley Estate, near Winchester, with her husband Darren, 33, and was found just before 2pm

Diverse: BoomTown Fair is a music festival where acts and music are divided between nine different districts - each with their own theme or style

A 
neighbour of Mrs Williamson’s parents said: ‘I haven't seen Lisa’s 
father Andy since Sunday, when he was obviously very upset. It's very 
sad for the family and the children.’

BoomTown
 Fair has been running for six years and features four days of live 
music and art events. Acts playing the festival include The Wailers, The
 Skatalites, Jimmy Cliff, Shaggy and Chas n Dave.

Revellers leaving the festival have spoken of their shock at the tragedy.

Dan
 Smith, 22, of London, said: ‘No one seems to know what led to the 
woman’s death, but it has cast a shadow over the whole festival.

‘We’ve had a great time here, but this is now the second year in a row that someone has died. This can’t keep happening.’

Another
 reveller said: ‘There were loads of warnings about the dangers of drugs
 this year because of what has happened in the past.’

A
 spokesman for the festival said: ‘BoomTown Fair would like to express 
our sincerest condolences to the family of the young woman who was found
 unconscious on site but despite the efforts of all our staff involved 
she was later pronounced dead shortly after arriving at Winchester 
Hospital.

‘Our thoughts are with all her loved ones at this tragic time, and the festival is doing all it can to assist those involved.’

Police are carrying out toxicology tests to ascertain whether she had taken any drugs or alcohol.

A spokesman for Hampshire Police said Miss Williamson’s death is not believed to be suspicious.

‘Police are providing support to her family including her husband who was at the festival with her,’ the spokesman added.

An inquest into her death was opened and adjourned at Winchester Coroner’s Court yesterday.

A full inquest will be held on October 7.

Last
 year public schoolgirl Ellie Rowe died after taking the horse 
tranquilliser ketamine at the festival in what was described as an 
uncharacteristic ‘act of stupidity’.

The
 18-year-old, from Glastonbury, Somerset, was working as a volunteer 
steward at the festival when she was found collapsed in her tent by a 
friend.

Paramedics attempted
 to revive Miss Rowe, including giving her a tracheotomy to aid her 
breathing, but she was pronounced dead in hospital.

Tests
 showed she was only just over the alcohol drink-drive limit and had 
2.14mg ketamine per litre of blood in her system - the second-lowest 
fatal dosage of the drug recorded.

Ketamine
 - taken as a party drug and nicknamed Special K - was upgraded from a 
Class C to a Class B substance by the government earlier this year.

In 2011, mother-of-two Deborah Jeffery, 45, died from a heart attack at the festival after taking Ecstasy.
