Football fans trying to avoid the rip-off prices being charged by hotels during Brazil’s World Cup next June are booking into Rio de Janeiro’s notorious favelas amid reports of an alarming increase in crime rates in the city.

The hillside communities, which are home to some of the poorest families in Rio, have a history of violent crime and drug trafficking.

But some are offering accommodation deals enviable for their breathtaking views from their elevated locations, near-to-the-beach convenience and budget-conscious prices of at least a third of the £300 a night average price being charged by hotels during the FIFA games.

In Rocinha, the largest favela in Brazil, a recent escalation in shootouts between rival drug gangs and the police since November, following the arrest of 25 officers for the alleged murder of a resident, Amarildo de Souza, has not prevented supporters from booking into the Rocinha Guesthouse.

Situated right at the top of the shanty-town and offering a stunning panorama of hundreds of pastel painted brick and wooden houses built haphazardly on the side of the mountain, the Rocinha Guesthouse is a family concern with two guest rooms: a mixed dorm offering six beds with an outside shared bathroom and a two bed en-suite.

‘We are already booked out for the World Cup. We have people coming from the UK, America and Europe. Some will stay for a day, for a week or a fortnight,’ revealed 18-year-old Oberdan Basilio, who manages the guesthouse with his mother, Neusa, 56.

Basilio, who was born in Rocinha, says the hillside slum is a safe place so long as tourists don’t take unnecessary risks. In May this year, a German tourist was shot in an alley and seriously wounded in the stomach while visiting the slum with a friend, without a guide.

Crime figures released this month by Brazil’s Public Security Institute (ISP) for Rio de Janeiro indicate a worrying increase in murders, robberies and rapes in the city just months before the World Cup kicks off.

In the ISP research comparing September this year to September 2012, murders in the capital grew by 17.5 per cent from 97 cases to 114. There were 409 cases of thefts against 191, a jump of 114 per cent and reported rapes rose from 150 to 179, an increase of 19 per cent.

’There are dangerous places in Rocinha because the drug dealing still goes on even though we have a large police presence operating here. The trouble is Rocinha is too big to be controlled by the police and so crime still happens,’ Basilio explained matter-of-factly.

‘I always tell our guests to stay on the main street. Don’t go wandering into the warren-like alleyways without a guide. Rocinha is huge and it’s very easy to get lost and put yourself in danger,’ he warned.British Foreign Office advice warns that: ‘All favelas are unpredictably dangerous areas. Violence... can occur at anytime.’

Ironically, a survey by the ISP marking five years this month since the first Pacifying Police Unite, or UPP, was installed in Santa Marta, found that in 18 out of the 36 pacified favelas, where 252,500 people live, there were 8.7 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants.

This makes a number of the shanty-towns, not including Rocinha, some of the safest places to live as the figure represents less than half the average murder rate in the country, which is 24.3 per 100 thousand.

Cristiana de Oliveira, 44, runs the 24-bed Favela Inn in Chapeu Mangueira, a shanty-town in Leme in the south zone of Rio. ‘Our favela is very peaceful. You don’t see any armed drug dealers walking around anymore. I have lived here nearly all my life and since the arrival of the UPP, I can sincerely tell my guests that they are safe walking here late at night and early in the morning.’

Quenia de Alleluia, 32, is hoping for record bookings from football fans in June at her Alzira de Alleluia Guesthouse in the Vidigal favela.

‘The money from our guests contributes to the sustainability of our community project which runs educational courses and football classes for the youngsters in the favela,’ explained de Alleluia.

‘Whoever comes to stay in our Guesthouse  is not just getting a good deal and an amazing experience, but they are giving something back to the community as well,’ she added.

Her accommodation can be found on the Brazilian apartment and room rental website Favela Experience, which was set up by American-born Elliot Rosenberg a year ago. The site offers a budget conscious choice of hundreds of beds in Rio’s favelas.

‘We have different levels of accommodation so our prices vary according to the property,’ Rosenberg explained.

‘A single bed per night in the Rocinha Guesthouse is £30 a night, but in the nearby Vidigal favela we have a studio apartment en-suite with five beds, next to the beach for £90 a night per person. All come with breakfast and a laundry service,’ he said.

‘People often come to a favela with low expectations, they imagine it to be squalid and dingy but they are pleasantly surprised when they arrive. Favelas have a higher level of comfort than many outsiders expect,’ argued Rosenberg.

Heather Watson, a 36-year-old teacher from Canada is staying at the Rocinha Guesthouse for the second time in two years. 

‘The community is so vibrant and full of women and children and people who work very hard. The criminal element is not representative of the people here,’ Watson observed.

‘It’s a densely packed place. There are people everywhere, there’s light everywhere and there’s sound everywhere. I feel part of a close-knit community and I feel safe here,’ she added.
