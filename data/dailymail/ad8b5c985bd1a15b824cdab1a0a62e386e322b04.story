New York Mets co-owner Jeff Wilpon has denied sacking the club's first ever female vice president because she had a child out of wedlock.

In her lawsuit against the Mets, Leigh Castergine says she was fired in August this year after enduring insults and humiliation from Wilpon, the team's Chief Operating Officer.

The 33-year-old claims the businessman told senior executives he was 'morally opposed' to her becoming pregnant while unmarried in August 2013, before dismissing her a year later.

But now, Wilpon has denied the claims that he sacked Castergine for the suggested reasons, saying he treated his employee 'without regard to her gender, marital status, pregnancy or leave'.

In court papers filed in federal court in Brooklyn on Friday, Wilpon said he has shown 'long-standing support' for Ivy League-educated Castergine, who worked as the head of the Mets's ticket sales.

His lawyer, Jeffrey Kohn, told the New York Post his client - the son of the club's principal owner, Fred Wilpon - terminated the former executive's employment for 'legitimate business reasons.'

These included workplace 'issues and conflicts' Castergine had with her immediate supervisors, who did not include Wilpon, he said.

Castergine, who was hired in December 2010 as vice president of ticket sales and services, also named Sterling Mets Front Office LLC as a defendant in her lawsuit.

She is seeking unspecified damages, as well as action to stop the Mets  from 'future discrimination'.

According to the lawsuit, Wilpon 'became fixated on the idea that Castergine would have a child without being married.'

He then started humiliating Castergine in front of others by - among other things - pretending to see if she had an engagement ring on her finger, it said.

He also allegedly openly stated in a meeting of the team's all-male senior executives that he is `morally opposed' to Castergine 'having this baby without being married'. 

The lawsuit said Wilpon also told Castergine, a University of Pennsylvania graduate, that she would make more money and get a bigger bonus once she was married. 

Then, it said, he told her 'something had changed' after the birth of her child and that she was no longer as 'aggressive' as she used to be. 

According to the New York Post,  Wilpon even warned Castergine's co-workers not to take any interest in her unborn child, who was born in March.

'Do not rub her belly,' the suit says he commanded. 'Don't ask how she's doing. She's not sick, she's pregnant.'

After Castergine complained to the team's human resources department, she was fired on August 26, the lawsuit said. 

In a statement last month, the Mets said: 'We have received and reviewed the complaint. The claims are without merit. 

'Our organization maintains strong policies against any and all forms of discrimination.'

In the lawsuit, Castergine's lawyers described how the one-time $6-an-hour ticket agent for the Philadelphia 76ers gained experience in more senior jobs with the Philadelphia Flyers, Orlando Magic and the Boston Bruins before joining the Mets organization.

The court papers said she introduced major pricing changes, new benefits and a flexible exchange policy for season ticket holders, earning two $50,000 raises, annual six-figure bonuses and a promotion to senior vice president.

One industry publication even described her as 'the next female president in the sports industry,' the lawsuit said.

But the goodwill soured with the announcement of her pregnancy, the lawsuit said. 

Her lawyers wrote that she became uneasy even before the announcement, when she attended a meeting of team executives in which one executive described how a female employee in the club's public relations department 'hasn't been the same since she had children' and might need to be moved to a different department.

Days later, she revealed her pregnancy and discrimination became apparent soon afterward, the lawsuit said.
