The Bureau of Prisons has rejected the Army's request to accept the transfer of national security leaker Pvt. Chelsea Manning from a military prison. So the military will begin treatment for her gender-identity condition.

A defense official said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has approved the Army's recommendation to keep Manning in military custody and start a rudimentary level of gender treatment.

The Army tried to get Manning transferred to the federal prison system, but officials said those discussions have ended.

Stays in place: Chelsea Manning, who originally became known to the world as the Army private who leaked 700,000 state documents to Wikileaks, has been denied a transfer to a civilian prison and will stay in military custody, it was announced this week

Manning has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the sense of being a woman in a man's body.

Civilian prisons can provide treatment, but the Defense Department doesn't have the medical expertise needed.

Civilian federal prisons are required to provide such treatment, if deemed medically necessary, for inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria.

Unlike in military prisons, the policy also allows inmates who believe they are the wrong gender to dress and live accordingly as part of their individual treatment plans.

No go: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has approved the Army's recommendation to keep Manning in military custody in Kansas. The Army tried to get Manning transferred to the federal prison system, but officials said those discussions have ended

Previously, the military has said it does not provide treatment for gender dysphoria because Pentagon policy dictates that transgender soldiers are not allowed to serve.

Officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly by name.

Manning was sentenced in August for six Espionage Act violations and 14 other offenses for leaking more than 700,000 secret military and U.S. State Department documents, along with battlefield video, while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2009 and 2010.

A judge has ruled that all court documents should refer to the Wikileaks informant as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning rather than Bradley Edward Manning.  

Previously, the military has said it does not provide treatment for gender dysphoria because Pentagon policy dictates that transgender soldiers are not allowed to serve. However, it has now been announced that she'll received a 'rudimentary' amount of gender treatment
