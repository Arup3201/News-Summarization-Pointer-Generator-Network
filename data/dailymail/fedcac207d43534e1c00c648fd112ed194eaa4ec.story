Noel Gallagher's outspoken nature is just one of a number of things the singer-songwriter is renowned for, so news that he is to appear on Match of the Day 2 as a pundit on Sunday is sure to make compelling viewing.

The former Oasis man will be reacting to Sunday's Premier League action, which will see Liverpool travel to Southampton, Tottenham host West Ham and Everton play bottom side Leicester.

Liverpool, Southampton and Tottenham will be looking to bolster their hopes of finishing in the top four with victory, while Leicester will need three points at Goodison Park to increase their chances of exiting the relegation zone.

Gallagher's beloved City play Newcastle in Saturday's late game, where Wilfried Bony could make his debut

Gallagher himself is a Manchester City fan and viewers will hope to see him give his thoughts on Manuel Pellegrini's side's game against Newcastle in Saturday's late kick-off.

Wilfried Bony could make his debut for City, as he and Yaya Toure are back from Ivory Coast's Africa Cup of Nations triumph and ready to play for Pellegrini's team.

Gallagher will be joined in the MOTD studio by Jermaine Jenas and Mark Lawrenson, with Mark Chapman presenting.
