A brave kayaker takes a 60ft plunge down a massive waterfall in Mexico.

Quebec-born Emrick Blanchette, who has been paddling for five years, travelled to the Tlapacoyan Veracruz region of the country to experience its high number of vertical drops.

But the experienced athlete admitted that he was apprehensive when going over Tomata Falls - which is more than 60ft high.

He said: 'I was pretty nervous at the top, scouting and visualising my line.

'I had seen a lot of people landing near-flat or over-flipping on video.

'The lip is kind of tricky as it is angled at almost 90 degrees. So every little movement, stroke and body position will have an influence on your line and landing angle.

Every stroke, movement and body position has an influence on whether or not Emrick would be successful

'Once I was in my boat, a big part of the stress went away and I knew I could stick it.'

The 23-year-old, who is part of kayaking team Quebec Connection, also tackled a number of other big drops during the trip.

And Blanchette was keen to stress the importance of having an experienced and trustworthy crew when tackling such dangerous waterfalls.

'I was pretty nervous at the top, scouting and visualising my line,' he said

Emrick believes another key to success is travelling and filming with a crew of people that you can trust

He added: 'The big parts are safety and filming.

'Personally, I think the best thing when running steep rapids or big drops is to be with a crew of people you trust.

'This way you can share thoughts about the line and you make sure you have friends you can trust for setting safety or if anything goes wrong.'Â
