Desperate cancer patients have been put in the ‘bizarre’ position of hoping their conditions deteriorate so they can get a drug that will soon be withdrawn from the NHS.

A type of life-prolonging pill called regorafenib is to be denied to patients from later this month to save money – but sufferers who have already started the £4,500- a-month treatment before then will be allowed to stay on it.

Mother-of-two Vicky Rockingham, 43, is one of the patients who must show her tumours are growing before March 12 if she is to be eligible for the drug. She said: ‘The drug I’m on at the moment allows me to lead a near-normal life. But it could stop working any day now.’

Her current medication, sunitinib, has been stalling the tumour’s growth, but cancer usually develops resistance to the drug over time, requiring a different prescription.

Mrs Rockingham’s doctor told her she has to ‘fail’ on her current drug before the cut-off date if she is to qualify for regorafenib. Speaking from her home in Stockport, Greater Manchester, she said: ‘It feels terrible. If my tumours are growing, I will say to my consultant, “Let’s quickly apply for regorafenib.” It’s a bizarre situation.’

Regorafenib is one of 16 drugs being cut from the list of medicines available from David Cameron’s £280 million Cancer Drugs Fund for all but the most exceptional circumstances. The radical cost-cutting drive will affect thousands of patients with advanced cancer across England.

Mrs Rockingham, who holds down a full-time job with the Environment Agency, suffers from a rare type of cancer known as ‘GIST’ – gastrointestinal stromal tumour. But the change will also hit those with breast, bowel and prostate cancer, as well as leukaemia and lymphoma. Studies show regorafenib could double average survival times, from about nine to 17 months. Some patients live far longer.

Another GIST patient in the same situation is Richard Bassett, a 27-year-old PhD meteorology student, who also fears he is starting to become resistant to sunitinib.

Mr Bassett, from Strawberry Hill in South-West London, said: ‘If sunitinib works less effectively for me, the next – and indeed only – treatment remaining is regorafenib. To find this will no longer be available through the Cancer Drugs Fund is highly stressful.

‘Living with this disease is worrying enough without having this added stress that regorafenib, which is proven to be successful for GIST treatment, will no longer be available.’

His girlfriend Victoria James, 28, added: ‘The Government seems to view people like Richard as dispensable. If his cancer starts growing after March 12, the fact that they are removing this drug will be a death sentence.’

The cuts are being made because the Cancer Drugs Fund has become a victim of its own success.

Set up in 2010 with a £200 million- a-year budget, about 60,000 patients have benefited so far. But it overspent its budget by £30 million last year – in part because or more applications – but also, say critics, because it has allowed drugs firms to keep charging sky-high prices. Its budget has been raised to £280 million for this financial year and will be raised again to £340 million in April.

Professor Peter Clark, chairman of the Cancer Drugs Fund, said: ‘These are difficult decisions, but if we don’t prioritise the drugs that offer the best value, many people could miss out on promising, more effective treatments that are in the pipeline.’

The cuts are being made because the Cancer Drugs Fund is so successful and costing more than expected

If she misses the March 12 deadline, she will be stuck on an inferior drug
