A controversial police campaign that 'names and shames' hundreds of drink-drivers on Twitter has been condemned as 'totally immoral'.

Several UK police forces adopted the new scheme this Christmas and New Year, in order to shame drink-drivers out of re-offending and 'scare' would-be offenders into not getting behind the wheel.

Police publish the name, age and sometimes even the address of offenders once they have been charged - either on their website, Facebook or Twitter.

But the scheme – so far adopted by Staffordshire, West Midlands, Devon and Sussex police forces -  has been criticised by lawyers and local politicians, for undermining a defendant's right to a fair trial.

Nick Freeman, a well-known celebrity lawyer, specialising in traffic and speeding offences, said: 'Naming these people before there is a guilty verdict is at best misguided; at worst it is totally immoral.

'Naming and shaming before conviction, unless it is in the public interest to do, is ridiculous and is potentially designed to encourage vigilante action.'

Mr Freeman, who is nicknamed 'Mr Loophole' for his ability to win unlikely high-profile court cases, added: 'I have represented hundreds of clients who have been acquitted for a whole variety of different reasons. This means they have been found not guilty.

'They leave court without a stain on their character.

'If any person has been named and shamed and is ultimately acquitted they may have a substantial claim for damages against the police.'

Staffordshire Police, which has published the names of more than 80 drivers on Twitter, has attracted the most controversy.

Mr Freeman has even called for the force's commissioner Matthew Ellis to resign over the campaign, accusing him of showing a 'cavalier disregard for the presumption of innocence'.

Labour councillor Mike Holder, who sits on the Staffordshire Police and Crime Panel whose job is to scrutinise Mr Ellis' job, also condemned the scheme.

'I think it would cause me concern if everybody that was charged was put on a public forum such as Twitter or Facebook,' he said yesterday. 'What are the consequences going to be?

'It attaches a stigma to an individual where perhaps there might be no reason for it, they might be totally innocent.

'The naming and shaming doesn't protect lives. I think if I was charged I would already by thinking about the consequences.'

Councillor Chris Cooke, leader of the Independent Group on Staffordshire County Council, agreed, saying police have gone 'too far'.

However, guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) states that drink drivers can be named in the media following being arrested and charged by the police.

And Mr Ellis said he continues to back Staffordshire's campaign.

He said: 'A recent survey suggests that the proactive approach being taken in Staffordshire and several other forces is raising the profile and potentially preventing people being killed or seriously injured on the roads.

'Over 60 per cent of people surveyed said that being named after charge would make them think more about the consequences of driving after having a drink,' he said.

Meanwhile, Kevin Scott, founder and director of campaigning organisation, Civil Liberty said last night that he saw nothing wrong with naming suspects after they've been charged.

'This is simply a procedural matter,' he said. 'It is a case of a high-flying lawyer getting his knickers in a twist.

'I suspect that Mr Freeman has a celebrity client on the verge of appearing in court following some form of driving offence and that he has been named on Twitter.

'I doubt if it was bin men and lorry drivers he was defending he'd be kicking up such a fuss,' he added.

However some say the campaign, by targeting drink drivers after they have committed a crime, is pointless because the crime has already been committed.

As part of the West Midlands Police festive crackdown on drink driving, the force also offered rewards to people who reported them with payments of up to £200.

Matt Dallaway, from the RAC, said he thought police should instead be focusing on preventing drink driving before it happens.

'I think most responsible motorists will prefer to encourage people not to get their keys out if they are in that condition,' he said.
