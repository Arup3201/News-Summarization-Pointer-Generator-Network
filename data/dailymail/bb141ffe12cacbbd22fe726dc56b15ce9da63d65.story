Tim Lambesis, pictured in court in May, faces nine years in jail if found guilty of hiring a hitman

The frontman of the Grammy-nominated 
Christian metal band As I Lay Dying will stand trial on a charge of trying to hire
someone to kill his estranged wife, a judge in San Diego ruled on Monday.

The
decision came after a preliminary hearing for Timothy Lambesis, 32, that 
featured several hours of testimony by prosecution witnesses, including 
an undercover officer who said he posed as a hitman named 'Red' and met with the singer.

San
Diego County sheriff's Officer Howard Bradley testified that Lambesis 
met him at a book store in May and told him he wanted his 
wife 'gone.'

Bradley told the court he asked Lambesis directly if he wanted his wife killed, and the singer replied, "'Yes, I do.'"

Lambesis
said his wife, Meggan Lambesis, had restricted his visits with their 
three adopted children after they were separated in September, Bradley 
recalled, adding he was also angry because she was going to get a chunk 
of his income in a divorce settlement.

Bradley said Lambesis told him at the end of their meeting, "'just to clarify, just so you know, I do want her dead.'"

The
officer said the singer then gave him a manila envelope containing his 
wife's name, photo, security code to her condo complex, description of 
her vehicle and $1,000.

Lambesis
also wrote down three dates that would be best for carrying out the hit
because he would be with his children and have an alibi, Bradley 
testified.

He said they agreed to set the total price at $20,000. Officers then arrested Lambesis.

Lambesis
has pleaded not guilty to solicitation for murder. If convicted, he 
could face up to nine years in prison. San Diego Superior Court Judge 
Robert Kearney set his arraignment for Oct. 22 at the courthouse in 
Vista.

Last August while on tour, Lambesis had emailed his wife to say he didn't love her, he wanted to 
end their relationship, and he no longer believed in God.

Motive: The court heard singer Tim Lambesis, pictured performing live during a concert at the Huxleys in Berlin, Germany, last year, had affairs with a 'string of women' and was 'substantially motivated' to kill his wife

Meggan Lambesis 
later learned her husband was having an affair and had been involved 
with 'a string of women.'

Sheriff's 
Officer John Buckley also testified during the hearing, telling the 
court that he initiated the investigation after receiving a report that 
Lambesis had asked a personal trainer at his gym to help him get rid of 
his wife.

After talking to the gym acquaintance, authorities arranged for the man to set up a meeting between Lambesis and Bradley.

Defense
attorney Thomas Warwick did not present any arguments during the 
hearing.

He previously said his client had been using steroids for body 
building and the drugs had a devastating effect on his mind.

Tim Lambesis, 32, began lifting weights, taking diet supplements last year in an effort to bulk up at the gym, his lawyer says.

'His
thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use,' defense lawyer Thomas Warwick had claimed in May.

Lambesis
has been free on $2 million bail since May and wearing a GPS monitor. 
The conditions will continue until he is arraigned, Kearney ruled.

The
singer also has been ordered to stay home and not contact Meggan 
Lambesis and their three children, who were adopted from Ethiopia.

As
I Lay Dying formed in San Diego in 2000 and has released six albums, 
including 2007's 'An Ocean Between Us,' which reached No. 8 on 
Billboard's charts.

A single from the album, 'Nothing Left,' was nominated for a Grammy for top metal performance.

The
band plays in an aggressive style that features lightning-speed metal 
guitar riffs. The group's philosophical lyrics have attracted a 
following of Christian rock fans.
