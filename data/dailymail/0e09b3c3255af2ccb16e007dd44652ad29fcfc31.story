The Ice Challenge, played properly, involves no alcohol and proceeds are donated to charities

A man has died of a heart attack after consuming a 1-litre bottle of bourbon and having his head drenched in ice cold water as part of a social media drinking game in New Zealand.

Willis Tepania, a 40-year-old father from Kaitaia, took part inÂ the game called the 'ice challenge' on Saturday night, downing a 1-litre of Jim Beam bourbon minutes after having a bucket of ice cold water thrown over her head.

The New Zealand Herald has reported he suffered a cardiac arrest five hours after taking part in the now viral drinking phenomenon, which involves participants submerging themselves in ice water or having a bucket poured over their head.

They then nominate others to take the challenge and make a donation to charity.

But in countless online videos, the exercise is conducted hand-in-hand with alcohol.

It is believed Mr Tepania fell asleep soon after his challenge and emergency services were called to to his Kaitaia home to treat him for a heart attack when he woke.

A St John spokesman said Mr Tepania was successfully resuscitated by emergency services shortly after 3am on Sunday, and he was rushed to Kaitaia Hospital. 'He was flown to Whangarei Hospital some time later,' the spokesman told the New Zealand Herald.

It is understood Mr Tepania died on Monday night. A grieving family member has warned others choosing to take part in the ice challenge to eliminate alcohol from the charitable activity.

The family member, not named, said those should do it for the 'right reasons.'

'Alcohol has nothing to do with the ice challenge.'

Footage of the event was taken but has since been destroyed.

It is expected the man's death will be referred to the coroner.

Vicki Moses, who started an ice challenge to fundraise for her five-year-old son Austin, also in Kaitaia, said drinking was not necessary. The ice challenge helped raise about $9000 for her son, who was diagnosed with leukemia in February.

What started as a nomination for just three people, went viral overnight, she said.

She said in the case of Mr Tepania's death, it appeared the challenge had gone too far and that was not what the game was initially intended to achieve.

The Cancer Society, which benefits from the ice challenge donations, has also warned against drinking.

'Cancer Society cares about your health and well being and so does not support the consumption of alcohol as part of this challenge,' it says on one of its websites
