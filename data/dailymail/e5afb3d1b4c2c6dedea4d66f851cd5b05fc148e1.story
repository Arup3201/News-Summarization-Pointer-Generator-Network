A left-wing ‘super-union’ with almost 1.8million members could be created by a controversial merger of Labour’s biggest donor Unite and the biggest civil service union after the election, senior Conservatives fear.

They warn that a merger between the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) and the Unite union would threaten the impartiality of Whitehall.

Half of all civil servants are members of the PCS, which is not currently politically affiliated. If the two unions merged, they would effectively be subsumed into a union which is Labour’s biggest financial supporter.

Unite, which has donated millions to Labour since Ed Miliband became leader of the party, could be set to merge with the Public and Commercial Services Union

Unite is at least five times larger than PCS, which claims a membership of 270,000. Unite, which has made £14.3million in donations to Labour since Ed Miliband became leader in 2010, has 1.42million members.

A Conservative source said: ‘A takeover of PCS by Labour’s biggest donor, Unite, would make over half of all civil servants members of a Labour-affiliated union.

‘PCS and Unite must come clean about their secret plans. No takeover can be permitted to imperil the perceived impartiality of the civil service.’

The PCS has been in financial difficulty following cuts to the civil service, as well as an end to a system where Government departments automatically deducted union dues from the payroll.

A leaked document suggests it plans to sell its headquarters to a private equity fund and suspend national elections for this year. The union blames its financial crisis on the downsizing of the civil service, now a fifth smaller than it was in 2010.

The end of the ‘check off system’, which saw union fees deducted automatically from salaries by many Government departments has also squeezed the PCS.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has overseen the closure of this scheme at the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, HMRC, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Defence. In addition, the Government has clamped down on so-called ‘facility time’, whereby union officials are paid by the taxpayer to work for a union.

The overall cost of such taxpayer-subsidised union officials has fallen by more than two-thirds, while the number of full-time union officials paid for by the public purse has fallen from over 200 to fewer than ten.

Last year, the PCS discussed the possibility of a merger with Unite at its annual conference, but the idea was shelved.

A source at the PCS played down the prospect of the deal with Unite being revived, saying: ‘It’s no secret that we had informal discussions. These proposals were never driven by finances. Our conference voted against a motion from the national executive saying we should carry on exploring it, and said we should set more formal conditions. So it’s not on the horizon.’

Unite’s general secretary Len McCluskey suggested last year there would be ‘no further progress’ on merger talks with the PCS unless it changed its membership rules.

Hinting at the reasons for the breakdown of talks, he told delegates ‘our rules don’t change, our structures don’t change’.

PCS members apparently insisted they would not back a new relationship with Unite if their union membership fees contributed to Labour Party coffers.
