The competition included a bear in wellington boots, pink aliens from outer space and a builder called Bob.

But when viewers were asked to choose their favourite BBC children’s character of all time, there was only one who was considered the best in his field – Shaun the Sheep.

The mischievous sheep knocked Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep into second and third place respectively, despite only hitting screens with his own show in 2007. He first appeared in the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit film A Close Shave in 1995.

Shaun the Sheep was voted the top BBC children's character in the poll followed by Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep who were second and third

Ben Preston, Radio Times editor, said Shaun the Sheep's victory was a 'testament to the enduring quality of British children's television'

The poll, by Radio Times and the British Film Institute, saw 41,000 people vote for their favourite from a shortlist of 50, all of which were either cartoon characters or puppets.

The results reveal the top three stars from each decade from the 1950s onwards, as well as the most popular for the entire period.

Richard Starzak, creator of the Shaun The Sheep television show, said: ‘Many BBC animated characters were a big and important part of my childhood. It’s amazing to think Shaun will be part of so many people’s happy memories.’

Postman Pat came second in the poll which saw 41,000 people vote for their favourite character from a list of 50, all of which were either cartoon characters or puppets

The series has won two Emmy awards and a Bafta for its 130 episodes.

Postman Pat starred in 141 episodes between 1981 and 2008 detailing his adventures in the village of Greendale.

Sooty and Sweep, the puppet bear and dog who communicate through a series of squeaks, have been an almost constant presence on children’s television for nearly 60 years. Their show was broadcast by the BBC from 1955 until 1967 and then moved to ITV.

Justin Johnson, a children’s TV expert at the BFI, said Shaun the Sheep, Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep are set apart from their contemporaries by how ‘likeable’ they are.

He said: ‘None of them are fantastical sci-fi characters, they are very every day, people can relate to them.

‘With Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep there is the nostalgia value, parents loved the characters so they want their children to as well. But nostalgia only works so far.

'For these three shows, their strength is fundamentally the quality of the storytelling, that’s what children and parents react to.’

Ben Preston, Radio Times editor, said: ‘It’s a testament to the enduring quality of British children’s television that a contemporary character topped the poll in a shortlist filled with classic programmes from the last seven decades.’
