A cabbie whose wife left him for a Neil Diamond impersonator was attacked by a drunken passenger when he refused to sing along to the crooner's famous hit Sweet Caroline.

Ken Collins, 77, was left bleeding after being punched in the face by Matthew Rothwell when he refused to join him in an impromptu duet.

Ken said the attack had left him 'in tears' and he'd lost two of his teeth and some of his dentures.

Traumatised: Cabbie Ken Collins, 77, was left bleeding. lost two teeth and traumatised after he was punched in the face by drunk Matthew Rothwell after he refused to sing with him

Rothwell, 52, a former glazing businessman, grew angry in the cab when Ken refused to sing along with him, calling him 'a miserable b******'. 

Great-grandfather Ken, from Bolton, 
said: 'I was going to reverse and he came up to the driver's side and 
punched me through the window.

'I was laid over the seat, in shock, and felt my teeth out. There was blood everywhere.'

Ken, who's been unable to listen to 
Neil Diamond since his wife left him 40 years ago, added: 'I couldn't 
sleep after it. I was in tears, there was just so much emotion.'

The day after the attack the veteran 
driver travelled to Thailand on holiday but was forced to come home 
early due to the injury and he still suffers from pain.

The attack happened in Failsworth, Oldham, on February 25 after Ken had picked up Rothwell from The Mitre pub in the town.

Ken, who works for Radio Cars in Manchester, told the Bolton News: 'Rothwell said, "Do you like Neil Diamond?" I said "All I want to do is get you home".

'I don't like Neil Diamond, my wife ran off with a fella in 1973 who sang Sweet Caroline and left me with the children.'

The pair had also clashed over the route Ken had taken in the cab.

Rothwell stuck two fingers up at Ken after paying his fare and Ken shot back, 'And you'.

Rothwell then walked back to the car and hit Ken with a single punch in the face

Rothwell, of Failsworth, admitted 
assault causing actual bodily harm and was handed a 12-month community 
order with supervision and 200 hours of unpaid work at Manchester's 
Minshull Street Crown Court.

He was also ordered to pay Ken £500 compensation.

Ken called the sentence 'disgraceful'.
