These disturbing pictures show the horrendous conditions in which a farmer kept almost forty dogs - including 22 puppies.

Paul Alton kept the animals in a static caravan at Trice Barn Farm in Bacup, Lancashire.

Burnley Magistrates Court heard the 51-year-old neglected to ‘provide the proper care’ to the dogs, which he was breeding with the intention to sell.

This filthy caravan was used as a makeshift kennel by the farmer who has been banned from keeping dogs

Over half of the animals were puppies, including these young alsatians which had been bred for profit

The rest of the farm was also in a dilapidated state as this neglected stable block shows

Breeds including terriers, collies and alsatians were found in conditions described by the RSPCA as 'squalid'.

One dog was found to have a bleeding malformed hind left leg after it was injured in a tractor accident a few years ago.

Another was seen climbing on top of a dead cow next to the stables.

The father-of-two was banned from keeping dogs for 10 years

He was also banned from transporting dogs, attempting to sell dogs or being party to any transaction or transportation.

When
 RSPCA officers visited the farm on April 23 last year they were shown 
around the outlying buildings which were found to be ‘completely 
unsuitable’ for the dogs.

The floor of the caravan was thick with muck and a chicken is even seen walking about inside

Outlying buildings such as this one were also found to be completely unsuitable for the dogs to be kept in

A damp, pen mad from old plywood was used to keep the dogs in

RSPCA
 officials were called to the farm after Alton was arrested last April 
for a string of firearms offences, including having a home-made pistol.

Michael
 Lea, defending, said Alton claimed the conditions were not like that 
when he had left the farm four days previously after he was arrested on 
firearms charges.

Police were called after he assaulted his wife of 15 years and she told police about firearms at the premises.

He
 was jailed for 30 months last December after admitting possessing a 
prohibited weapon, a.22 pistol, pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife 
Kim Alton, possessing a 12 gauge shotgun without a certificate and 
possessing ammunition  without a firearms certificate.

Sentencing,
 magistrate Irene Devine said: “Aside from the harm that you will have 
caused your dogs you must think of the health risks that you will have 
subjected your children to. This disqualification will stop you dealing 
with dogs for a long time.”

Speaking
 after the case, Inspector Small said: “They were conditions that no 
animal should have to be placed in and they were absolutely appalling.

“I’m really pleased about the disqualification and it’s good that he will not be able to appeal for five years.

“The
 conditions that the dogs were subjected to were terrible and I hope 
that this decision will deter him and others from ever doing anything 
like this again.”

The appalling conditions caused the dogs to suffer, with some sustaining terrible injuries
