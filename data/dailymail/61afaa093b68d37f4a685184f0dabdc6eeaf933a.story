Unshaven and dishevelled, this is billionaire Hans Rausing, pictured for the first time since he appeared in court in connection with his wife’s death.

The Tetra Pak heir made a rare public appearance for a shopping trip in London yesterday, wearing a baggy shirt and shoes without laces.

Mr Rausing, 49, has been charged with preventing the lawful burial of his wife Eva, 48.

At a hearing on July 18, he was bailed to a secure mental hospital where he is receiving treatment for a mental breakdown and drugs withdrawal.

It is a condition of his bail that he does not leave the hospital without being accompanied by a member of staff, and yesterday he was flanked by minders as he walked down Edgware Road.

Mr Rausing, whose fortune comes from the £4.5billion Tetra Pak drinks carton empire, remains under arrest on suspicion of murdering his wife but cannot be interviewed until declared fit by medical staff.

Mrs Rausing’s body was found when police forced their way past a housekeeper shouting ‘out of bounds’ as they searched for drugs at the couple’s sprawling £70million Chelsea mansion.

Investigators suspect the American may have been lying dead for up to two months under a pile of bin bags, clothes and bed linen several feet deep.

They made the grim discovery on July 9  after stopping Mr Rausing for ‘swerving and driving erratically’ in South London.

The couple had been married for 21 years and had four children.

The decomposition of Mrs Rausing’s body has made identifying how she died more difficult for police and pathology staff.

A post-mortem examination last week failed to find a cause of death and a second may take place this week on the instructions of her husband’s legal team.
