Today show host Matt Lauer and his NBC co-star Kathie Lee shared a Lady and the Tramp-style kiss on Tuesday morning - using a piece of red licorice instead of spaghetti – as a part of the new Twizzler Challenge, the latest charitable dare, which is aimed at raising awareness about autism.

The duo’s fellow Today correspondent Meredith Vieira appeared on the show to nominate Matt and Kathie Lee for the challenge, which required the pair to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and eat the licorice until their lips met in the middle for a kiss.

'Just like Lady and the Tramp,' said Al Roker of the charitable Disney-inspired act.  

Close co-stars: Kathie Lee and Matt Lauer took the Twizzler Challenge on the Today show Tuesday morning

Meredith explained that she first took the challenge, which has quickly gained momentum with the country’s top TV hosts, with Today co-anchor Willie Geist last week on her talk show and later donated $5,000 to support autism programs nationwide.

'This is clearly a transparent attempt by Meredith once gain to make out with her colleague,' Willie joked on the morning show.

Like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, those who fail to complete the Twizzler test after being nominated have to donate to Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism.

Following the rules: Kathie Lee wanted to know if she could use her hands when they placed the Twizzler in their mouths for the challenge

People in charge: Meredith Vieira and Willie Geist, who previously took the challenge on her talk show, told them that they were able to use their hands 

Meredith immediately made it clear that she intended to challenge Matt, but remained coy about who his partner would be. 

'Is there anybody around that we can ask?' Willie said.

Savannah Guthrie, who was sitting next to Matt, quickly left her chair. 

Loving gaze: Kathie Lee stared deeply into Matt's eyes throughout the Twizzler Challenge

Fun times: Matt couldn't help but crack a smile at Kathie Lee's wide-eyed facial expression 

'I am willing to get up out of this seat,' she said as she made room for Matt's partner. 

When Kathie Lee walked on stage, Matt enthusiastically told her: 'Get over here.'

Kathie Lee joked to Matt: 'Your world is going to be on fire.'

'This is nothing compared to what goes on in the make-up room,' she added. 

One more time: After pulling away from their initial kiss, Matt moved back in to give Kathie Lee another peck on the lips

Perfect pair: Matt told Kathie Lee that he loves her and would have done the challenge with her for free

As Kathie Lee and Matt sat face to face, they both noted that their awkward encounter was all in aid of a good cause.

'And then we get to challenge somebody,' Matt explained.  

Kathie Lee stared at Matt with her eyes wide open before she started to furiously eat the Twizzler that was in her mouth, quickly moving towards her partner.

'Really aggressive,' Willie commented from the sidelines.

Charitble act: After sharing a Lady and the Tramp style kiss with Willie, Meredith donated $5,000 to New York Collaborates for Autism

Matt pulled away as Kathie Lee's lips brushed his, only to move back into to give her another kiss.

'I love you anyway,' he said. 'I would have done that for nothing.'

Someone else joked: 'Whose the Lady and whose the Tramp?'

After their epic kiss, Kathie Lee nominated her former co-host Regis Philbin and her current co-star Hoda Kotb for the Twizzler Challenge.

Mismatched pair: Access Hollywood's Billy Bush and Kit Hoover struggled to stay together when they took the Twizzler challenge last Friday 

Silly dare: The two barely brushed lips before quickly pulling apart

But Matt had a different pairing in mind, noting that the cast of Mad Men would be on the show on Monday.

'I'm available,' Savannah said as soon as the good looking cast was mentioned.

Matt ultimately chose actors Jon Hamm and John Slattery to take on the challenge.

'If John Slattery needs an understudy for that Twizzler Challenge with Jon Hamm, I am available,' Savannah reminded Matt again.

New nominees: Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and Nina Parker also took the challenge on Access Hollywood Live

Look of love: Piers leaned in for a kiss during the challenge and later said it was 'really enjoyable' 

The Twizzler Challenge started earlier this month at Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars benefit for autism, which was hosted by Jon Stewart.

When someone on Twitter dared Willie and Orange is the New Black star Uzo Aduba to have a Lady and the Tramp moment with licorice in exchange for a donation, the Twizzler Challenge was born.

Access Hollywood co-hosts Billy Bush and Kit Hoover also took up the same candy-based encounter on their show last Friday before nominating Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and his fellow guest Nina Parker to do the same.

'I got to say that was really enjoyable,' Piers said after they completed the challenge. 

Major moment: After Willie and Uzo Aduba were dared to have a Lady and the Tramp moment with licorice at Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars benefit for autism , the challenge started to become popular 

Big dare: Twitter user Fred Katz started the Twizzler Challenge by tweeting that Willie and Uzo should do it at the benefit earlier this month
