This is the moment a heartless pet owner dumped a dog suffering from terminal cancer on the steps of an animal shelter at 4am in near freezing temperatures.

The shadowy figure can be seen lurking in the bushes outside the RSPCA branch in Coventry before appearing to yank up his trousers and heading off into the darkness.

With the centre not due to open for several hours, the dog was left shivering and close to death outside the shelter, abandoned by his owner in what RSPCA staff are saying is one of the worst cases of animal cruelty they have ever encountered.

Abandoned: The Rottweiler, named Harris by staff, 
was discovered by a worker at the centre, and was later
found to be so riddled with huge cancerous tumours that he had to be 
put down

The Rottweiler, named Harris by staff, was discovered the next morning by a worker at the centre, and was later found to be so riddled with huge cancerous tumours that he had to be put down.

Glenn Mayoll Animal Centre Manger said: 'This truly is the worst abandonment of any animal at the centre in the eight years I have worked here.

'Poor Harris had obviously been suffering for several weeks and then finally to be left in such a manner is just appalling.'

CCTV stills show the twisted owner in an unidentifiable car pull up on the driveway of the centre at 3.45am on Wednesday, September 19.

The figure then drags the poor dog on a sleeping bag next to the centre’s gated entrance, in Coundon Wedge Drive, Allesley.

He
deliberately hides his face from view, leaving the helpless creature to
freeze for over three hours on one of this year’s first cold autumn 
nights.

The family pet, described as 'helpless and gentle' by RSPCA staff, was then discovered by a worker when she arrived at 7.30am, finding him unable to walk, dangerously thin from malnourishment and in a complete state of collapse.

Centre staff rushed the helpless dog to a vet’s surgery where he was immediately put on a drip as he was seriously dehydrated.

His swollen front leg had a tumour that stretched from his shoulder to his knee and staff said it had surely been there for months as his bony frame was covered in pressure sores.

Sadly x-rays revealed Harris was 
suffering from bone cancer which surrounded his entire leg bone and he 
was also showing signs of secondary cancer in his chest, meaning he had 
to be put down.

The RSPCA has appealed for information as to the owners’ identity of what they said was a premeditated act of neglect.

Mr Mayoll added: 'Tragically the kindest thing to do was to put poor Harris to sleep and end his ongoing suffering.

'We all know saying goodbye to a much loved pet is hard but it is something every pet owner takes on when they take on an animal.

'Hard as it is failing to act only causes more suffering for the poor animal. I urge anyone who may have information regarding the owner of this dog to come forward.'

A spokeperson for the RSPCA added: 'We are appealing for information as to the owners of this animal who had obviously allowed him to suffer for several weeks and finally extending that suffering by leaving him for dead on the Animal Centre’s doorstep.

'Anyone who may have any information can call 0300 1234 999 and leave a message for RSPCA Inspector Louise Labram who will be investigating the case.'
