You’d be hard pressed to make it through BBC1’s latest three-part nature series without getting a lump in your throat. Operation Wild sees Clare Balding join a group of pioneering vets from Britain and around the world as they save the lives of animals, and on her trips to China and West Africa she reports on two of the most moving animal stories ever shown on TV.

First she’s in the Himalayan foothills, at a sanctuary where vets are using the latest human neo-natal techniques to help giant pandas to breed. In the wild, when panda mums have twins, they abandon one cub to die. The mothers can’t produce enough milk to suckle two young. Even in captivity, the second baby couldn’t survive on formula milk as there are crucial antibodies in its mother’s milk.

Vets at the Wolong sanctuary have developed a rota system that fools the pandas into caring for each baby, one week at a time. And that means there is always a nursery where dozens of infant pandas are rolling around, sucking on milk bottles.

‘You see so many pictures of pandas and think, “They can’t possibly be that cute in real life." And you get here... and really they are that cute!’ laughs Clare.

Her second trip is far sadder. At a sanctuary for gorillas and orangutans in Cameroon, run by conservationist Rachel Hogan, Shufai, a teenage gorilla, is living with horrific injuries caused by poachers. When he was a baby, humans butchered his mother for bush meat while she was cradling him.

Shotgun pellets left Shufai with a useless left arm, and amputation has become inevitable. The surgery is almost too painful to watch. But when Clare returns to Cameroon eight months later, Shufai’s gorilla friends had encouraged him to play again. They even taught him to do something he’d never dared try before – Shufai can now, one-handed, climb a tree. ‘He’s been able to re-establish himself as the peacemaker in the gorilla group,’ says Clare. ‘He’s the good boy in the class!’

Clare’s co-host is Steve Leonard, a vet who works with his brother in Crewe, and who’s been flying off at a moment’s notice to Africa or Asia to document the strides made in medicine for endangered species for the show. ‘Luckily I have the most understanding boss in the world – my brother Tom,’ he says. ‘It can be surreal. I’m doing the day job – then the BBC rings and I’m off to the airport. Hamsters in the morning, hippos in the evening!’

His experience with British pets can be invaluable thousands of miles away. ‘I had to remove a damaged eyeball from an orangutan,’ he says. ‘I’ve done that many times on cats because of little boys with airguns – I’d never done it on an ape, but it was basically the same anatomy. An orangutan is like a big orange cat with hands.’

Will Thomas, the youngest vet on the show, faced a more exotic challenge in Laos when he treated Tom Kun, an elephant with a bullet in its leg. He wanted to X-ray the infected leg, and had borrowed a valuable radiography machine from a nearby hospital. But the elephant wouldn’t stand still and the doctors feared he’d crush the £40,000 X-ray device. Tom Kun’s keeper saved the day by leaping onto the elephant’s back and covering the animal’s eyes while crooning a lullaby. Briefly bemused, Tom Kun stayed still long enough for Will to get the X-ray.

In Ahmedabad, India, Steve attended the annual kite festival, where fliers dip their strings in glue and powdered glass and try to slice through the lines of other kites. This takes a terrible toll on birds as the lines slice through their wings like cheesewire. The terrified creatures are bundled up by volunteers and rushed to a makeshift clinic to be patched up. The first challenge is to give them a transfusion. It takes great skill to find the artery in a bird’s leg and insert a tube. Only then can the surgeon sew up the wings.

Steve insists that showing these heart-rending scenes encourages the public to help. ‘When I made the Orangutan Diary series in 2007 we focused on a charity that was facing closure from lack of funds. The result was amazing – financial security, new buildings for the apes, extra staff. The British are born animal lovers, it’s just that sometimes we have to be reminded to care. Some say animal programmes are too emotional, but that’s the best way to motivate people.’
