It has all the elements of a traditional Christmas dinner from turkey and sprouts to roast potatoes, parsnips and pigs in blankets... but there's one big difference.

This festive feast is served in a hot dog bun.

The Christmas Dinner Dog is the invention of Mike and Emily Edge owners of the Splendid Sausage Company, Manchester and their head chef Samuel Longhurst.

Chef Samuel Longhurst puts the finishing touches to Splendid Sausage Company's Christmas Dinner Dog.

The £10 dish has a beef and horseradish sausage in a white roll, topped with pulled buttered turkey, sprouts, bacon and chestnuts with Worcestershire Sauce. The structure is then drizzled with homemade gravy

The trio developed the idea from the 'Sunday Dinner Dog' they had been serving as a special every Sunday. 

The £10 dish consists of a beef and horseradish sausage in a white roll, topped with pulled buttered turkey.

Next a 'sticky mix' of sprouts, bacon and chestnuts with Worcestershire Sauce, which helps hold the dish together, is added.

Miniature roast potatoes and honey-roasted parsnips and carrots are then perched on top and three skewers inserted - two with mini Yorkshire puddings and stuffing balls and one with a pig in a blanket.

The whole structure is then drizzled in hearty homemade gravy. 

Mini roast potatoes, honey-roasted parsnips, carrots, mini Yorkshire puddings, stuffing balls and a pig in a blanket complete the rest of the 1,500-calorie hot dog

Mr Edge said: 'The Christmas Dinner Dog has been our most popular special by far. We've even had couples coming back especially to order it again.

'We love making themed dishes and we wanted to create an entire Christmas dinner in a hot dog but we knew we couldn't just chuck the sprouts on.

'It took a few goes to get right - some of the ingredients are quite high up in the finished structure so it overbalanced a few times until we started using the skewers.' 

Mr Edge and Mr Longhurts have also created a vegetarian version of the dish - a veggie sausage wrapped in seaweed, minus the bacon and pig in a blanket.

While it sounds fairly gut-busting, Mr Edge says it's been popular with men and women alike and is by no means a 'man versus food' meal.

He added: 'It's not especially calorific because it's not a huge dish, but I'd guess it contains about 1,500 calories which is the same as the average Christmas dinner.

'It's a manageable portion; i's not like you have to force feed yourself. Most people order a side dish too, like our Eggs Benedict fries.

'We wanted to try out something Christmassy but stay true to our hot dog roots. 

'The dish was added to the menu a couple of weeks ago and we'll serve it up until we close for Christmas on the 23rd December. 

'Although if people ask for it, I'm sure we can rustle it up between Christmas and New Year.'
