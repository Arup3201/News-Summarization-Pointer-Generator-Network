They often spent Christmas lunch together. And this morning, Australian skipper Michael Clarke and his wife Kyly had their dear friend, felled batsman Phillip Hughes, on their minds.

The Clarke family today paid tribute to their mate from Macksville, in northern New South Wales, both posting a heartfelt mesage to their old friend on their Instagram pages.

'Today you will have Christmas with us bro,' Clarke said in a post shared by his wife. The words were accompanied by a photograph of a  Phillip Hughes tribute candle and a framed photograph of the three sharing an evening on the town.

Brothers: Michael Clarke and Phillip Hughes were the best of mates

'Rest in peace, my little brother. I'll see you out in the middle': Clarke's eloquent address at Hughes' funeral was widely praised

Hughes was struck in the head by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on November 25. 

He never recovered from the blow and died two days later, surrounded by friends at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner-east.

The life of the star cricketer, known to his family as 'Boof', was celebrated at an emotional memorial service in Macksville a week later.  

Clarke's eloquent eulogy to his fallen 'little brother' at the service was widely praised.

The Australian captain said he could scarcely believe the young star had been 'taken from the game and from his loved ones at the age of 25'. 

'His spirit is still with me and I hope it never leaves,' he told assembled mourners, before adding that Hughes' soul would act as a 'custodian of the sport we all love'.

'We must listen to it, we must cherish it, we must learn from it, we must dig in ... we must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on. 

'So rest in peace, my little brother, I’ll see you out in the middle.'

In a social media tribute following the service, Kyly Clarke reflected on memories the trio had shared together. 

'Our Xmas lunch buddy, a friend we trust, our trivia night partner, the guy who was never fussed!' 

'WE LOVE YOU HUGH DOG, LIFE WONT BE THE SAME, HERE'S TO THE DAY WE SEE YOU AGAIN!' 

While this year's celebrations may be bittersweet, the Clarkes showed the spirit of Christmas still lived on with their family.  

The Australian captain shared a jolly picture of himself and two nephews wearing Santa hats later this morning.
