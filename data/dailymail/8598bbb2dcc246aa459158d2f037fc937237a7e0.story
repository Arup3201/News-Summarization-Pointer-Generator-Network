The widow of a volunteer fire fighter who died in the blaze at a West, Texas fertilizer plant one year ago has opened up about how she went through her pregnancy alone.

'People would tell me how strong I was. I don’t really feel strong. I just had to go on because I had two kids and I was pregnant,' Becky Calvin said.

Her husband Perry was a farmer who volunteered with fire departments in the nearby towns of Navarro Mills and Mertens, and their crews were called when the scale of the fire was fully realized.

Tragic: Her husband Perry Calvin was one of 12 volunteer fire fighters who died in the blaze at a West, Texas fertilizer plant on April 17 of last year

'The pregnancy is probably more of what kept me going because I had to take care of the baby, so I had to eat and I had to sleep. Things that I didn’t want to do, I just knew I had to do because I didn’t have a choice,' Becky said to The Star-Telegram.

She was about two months pregnant at the time of the April 17 explosion, and her husband was thrilled when they found out that they were expecting.

The couple already had two sons and thought they were bound to have another boy. It was only after Perry's death that Becky learned that their third child was due to be a girl.

'When I found out, I was happy but it was very emotional. I knew he’d never get to see her. He really wanted a girl, so it was bittersweet,' she told the paper.

The Calvin family has a tradition of 
naming their children so they have 'p' and 'w' as initials, and Becky 
told how one of her sons suggested the girl be named Presley but she 
went with one that she and her husband had picked out for her middle 
name- Wreanne- which the couple had picked as a female option for their 
first two children.

Bad feeling: Becky Calvin says that she feared that something had happened to Perry when he didn't respond to her text

'She has eyes like mine and a complexion like mine, but I think she has his lips and she’s tall,' Becky said.

'I hate that he’s not here, especially with her being a girl, to enjoy her but it was special to have another part of him.'

Perry Calvin, 37, was just one of the volunteer firefighters who raced to protect families and elderly residents who lived near the fertilizer plant that fateful night.

Stores of ammonium nitrate exploded in a gigantic blast that registered as a small earthquake and sprayed debris miles away.

Fifteen people were killed, including 12 volunteer firefighters and others responding to the fire, and more than 200 were injured. The blast caved in homes and schools, and destroyed water lines and roads.

In the weeks and months after the explosion, residents and city officials talked about how to persevere — to "Keep West West."

The signs of physical progress are obvious: Gone are the dozens of wrecked homes with tongue-in-cheek 'For Sale!' messages spray-painted on their walls, and about 70 homes are finished or in the process of construction.

Two new schools and a nursing home to replace those destroyed by the explosion will soon give displaced students and elderly residents a better sense of normalcy.

Payments from the city's long-term recovery fund, which received about $3.6million in donations, have been delayed as organizers deal with unforeseen paperwork and federal regulations.

What remains: This photo was taken on Tuesday, just two days before the one year anniversary of the blast and shows how the reconstruction process is far from over

The city's go-to person for that sort of work, City Secretary Joey Pustejovsky, was a volunteer firefighter who died in the blast.

West Mayor Tommy Muska said he's closely watching the emotional toll the blast has taken on the city's 2,800 residents, especially victims who are still recovering.

'A lot of them have suffered some type of post-traumatic stress of some sort,' Muska said.

'I am definitely concerned. We are not going to lose sight of that.'

Holly
 Harris' husband, Dallas Fire-Rescue Captain Kenneth Luckey Harris, 
rushed to save other first responders when he saw smoke at the plant. 
When she didn't immediately hear from him, she sensed he may have died.

Becky Calvin had a similar unnerving feeling.

'I immediately got worried because I knew Perry was over there,' she told the Star-Telegram.

Remembrance: The town has tried to 'Keep West West' but for so many, like the Calvins, that is a difficult task

'I
 felt different. I knew something was wrong because he always, even if 
he didn’t have time to talk or anything, if I sent him a text, he would 
just send one back, saying "OK" or "I’m OK" just so I wouldn’t worry... I
 couldn’t even get that, so I knew it was more than just him being 
busy.'

Mrs Harris remains in
 their home outside West, where the fence now has a metal shield with 
her husband's initials above a fireman's hat. One of her sons remains a 
Dallas firefighter, and another has since signed up.

Harris
 and others say they've chosen to push forward and not dwell on 
unanswered questions, such as what sparked the fire or what firefighters
 knew going in — or what could have been done to prevent it.

'It's just a choice that we've made that we're not going to be sad,' she said.

'I mean, we are sad at times, but we're going to try to make everything a happy situation and try to get on with our lives.'
