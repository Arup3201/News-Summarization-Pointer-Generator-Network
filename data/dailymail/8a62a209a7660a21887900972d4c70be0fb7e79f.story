A pensioner was duped out of his life savings by a con-artist who posed as the heir to an Italian millionairess, a court was told.

Scott Travis, 44, is alleged to have cheated nearly £100,000 from the man after claiming his name was 'Franco' and that he was set to get £1.7m from his mother's will.

He also claimed he needed to fly to Italy for specialist cancer treatment, and turned up at the pensioner's house with a bandaged head after having a 'tumour' removed.

Alleged conman: Scott Travis tried to dodge photographers as he left Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester. He denies charges of fraud, obtaining property by deception, blackmail and perverting the course of justice

Minshull Street Crown Court heard that Travis was actually on benefits and living in a Manchester council house with his girlfriend Gail Heyworth.

Lisa Boocock, prosecuting, said: 'It was all a sham. He was using the money to pay for plastic surgery.'

The court was told that Travis got into a relationship with the pensioner after placing a personal advert in a newspaper which said he was seeking companionship. 

It was claimed he then made several demands for cash between 2003 and 2010.

Ms Boocock said: 'At first the man didn't object. He was happy to help somebody... but the demands kept coming.'

The jury heard that Travis, of Baguley Crescent, Middleton, demanded £20,000 for 'cancer treatment' in Italy and cash to pay off debtors.

Ms Boocock said the pensioner was 'absolutely terrified' for the safety of 'Franco' and went to the police, who told him he may have been the victim of a con-artist.

At that stage he decided not to make a formal complaint. 

On trial: The prosecution claim Travis used the £100,000 he swindled to pay for plastic surgery, and lied about needing specialist cancer treatment

Travis then disappeared, but returned in 2010 and claimed he needed £35,000 to release cash from his mother's will.

The court was told that another man, David Hannon, went to the pensioner's house and told him he was going to hurt 'Franco' unless the pensioner paid £30,000.

Ms Boocock said the pensioner was so frightened that he moved out of his home and went to stay with relatives.

The prosecution claim Travis and Miss Heyworth, 50, later tried to contact him and that she left phone messages in which she pretended to be a solicitor.

The pensioner, speaking to the court via a video-link, said: 'I trusted him. I liked him. Something about him was appealing. He was remarkable in his knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome. He was very attractive to me intellectually.'

Travis denies four counts of obtaining property by deception, one count of fraud, two counts of blackmail and one count of perverting the course of justice.

Miss Heyworth, of Baguley Crescent, Middleton, denies one count of perverting the court of justice.
