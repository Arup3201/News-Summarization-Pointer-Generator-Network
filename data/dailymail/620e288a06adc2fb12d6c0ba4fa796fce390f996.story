The headless body of a tattoo artist has been found cut into at least 16 pieces - but police are insisting his death was an accident.

The body of Paras Bhasin was discovered by railway tracks in Ganesh Nagar in east Delhi, India, and detectives believe he was crushed by a train.

The 23-year-old could only be identified by the tattoo on his arm, which bore the name of his wife.

Mr Bhasin's family believe he was murdered, claiming his wife's relatives had threatened him recently because they had not accepted the marriage.

His mutilated body parts were spread across half a kilometre and, according to the dead man's family, police have yet to recover the head.

Sanjiv Bhasin, the dead man's father, said: 'Three days ago when they threatened 
to cut my son into pieces, we thought they were just angry and would 
calm down.'

Mr Bhasin married his wife in May this year, against the wishes of his in-laws who did not want the match.

According to the dead man's 
relatives, who live in Meenakshi Gardens in west Delhi, his wife sent 
him a message at 1pm - about three hours before his death.

In the message, she allegedly warned 
her husband about her parents, apologised for their 'insulting' 
behaviour and told him to forget her.

On the day of his death Mr Bhasin had left his home at about 3.30pm to meet with his lawyer. Police say he died at about 4pm.

The family also say they were informed about Mr Bhasin's death by an anonymous caller who provided the precise whereabouts of the body.

They claim the anonymous person called the dead man's mother more than 15 times in less than half an hour.

Mr Bhasin's brother-in-law Karan said way the body was cut it was unlikely he had been hit by a train.

He told the Times of India: 'We found his arms at different 
places while the torso was found at a another place. His legs too were 
found chopped off and thrown away at quite some distance from each 
other.

'His phone was found crushed, with the
SIM card removed. If at all he was crushed by a train, we suspect he 
was first murdered and then thrown on the tracks.'

Delhi's railway police said they were still investigating the cause.

A senior police official told the Times of India: 'We suspect he may have been hit by a train. We are 
waiting for the autopsy report and investigations are under way. We are 
probing all angles.'
