Police are investigating claims that Leonard Rossiter, pictured, was in a gang of sex attackers

Leonard Rossiter died in his dressing room at the Lyric Theatre in London where he was starring in Joe Orton’s black comedy Loot.

The squash-playing, keep-fit enthusiast had a heart attack that was sudden and unexpected.

A unique aspect of the tributes to the much-loved actor and TV sitcom star was the paucity of wicked anecdotes about him. There were none of those villainous tales that are normally whispered back-stage about major stars.

As his biographer Guy Adams observes, Rossiter approached acting ‘as a job, as solid and practical as book-keeping or car mechanics’.

Now, 30 years after the actor’s death in 1984 at the age of just 57, an anecdote of unique wickedness has finally emerged.

What’s more, it is as potentially destructive to the memory of the star of TV’s Rising Damp and The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin as an unexploded bomb discovered under the floorboards — and just as distressing to his 87-year-old widow Gillian Raine.

In the continuing fall-out of the sordid Jimmy Savile affair, a 66-year-old fellow actor is alleging that in 1968, when he was 18 and working as an extra on a BBC2 drama in which Rossiter was starring, he was sexually abused twice while an ‘excited’ Rossiter watched.

They were making the ground-breaking sci-fi story The Year Of The Sex Olympics. It depicted a dystopian world in which the media is controlled by an elite few who keep the masses docile by pumping out pornography and reality-TV shows.

As part of the plot, the young actor — as well as a girl extra, also allegedly attacked — was covered in gold paint. He claims that he endured two rape attempts by three men in a rehearsal room, and was shouting for help as Rossiter looked on.

‘He obviously found it a big turn-on,’ he has claimed. ‘He was watching with glee.’

The claim is being investigated by police officers from Operation Yewtree who are working their way through hundreds of post-Savile allegations of historic abuse by BBC stars. Some famous names have been jailed, but there has been only mixed success in obtaining convictions.

In the case of Rossiter — an allegation that dates back 46 years — they will interview up to ten former BBC staff involved in the drama’s production.

Unsurprisingly, friends of the family are appalled that three decades after his death, attempts are being made to bring about what one describes as ‘the rise and fall of Leonard Rossiter’. 

Messages of support and goodwill have been pouring into the little terraced house near Chelsea’s football ground in Fulham, southwest London, into which Leonard and Gillian (his second wife) moved just two years before his death, and where she — also an actress — still lives.

‘It’s terrible for Gillian to have to go through all this when Len isn’t here to defend himself,’ declares one friend of the family. ‘It’s hardly justice. Everyone’s very upset.’

One of the complainants claimed the abuse occurred on the set of a drama, which was filmed at BBC Television Centre, pictured, in 1968

Inevitably, that includes the couple’s
 only child, Camilla, 41, who is married and lives in Kingston, 
Surrey, and is a stalwart protector of her father’s memory.

‘Camilla
 is very angry,’ says one close figure. ‘Her dad’s memory means 
everything to her. She can hardly believe that anyone can even think he 
behaved like that. He wasn’t a pop star or a disc jockey, but a serious 
actor, for goodness sake. His family was everything.’

The
 family ethic was certainly important to Liverpool-born Rossiter, who 
began his working life as an insurance clerk. His father, a barber and 
illicit bookie, was killed by a bomb during the Second World War while on duty 
as a volunteer ambulance driver, and young Len’s pay helped out his 
widowed mother.

But he 
reached a point where, he said, he was ‘bored out of my mind’ with the 
insurance business and chucked it in to become an actor. Ever a 
perfectionist, he took elocution lessons which resulted in the clear and
 concise voice that made his characters so real.

Outside
 acting, his passions were his family, good wine, sport (as a boy he was
 a spin bowler for Lancashire Colts), Everton FC and playing chess 
against an electronic machine.

But as a star, he lived a quiet life, finding fame ‘a bit tiring’.

The reason was he could never avoid people identifying him with his roles and calling out to him in the street.

He
 had created two of the finest TV characters of the times, and the 
public recognised him as Rigsby, the lecherous, snivelling landlord of 
Rising Damp, and as Reggie Perrin, the disillusioned executive who fakes
 his own death and returns in disguise to take up his old job.

People
 also loved the smugly self-satisfied bore he played in those memorable 
Cinzano advertisements, soaking Joan Collins on a passenger jet. Collins
 wept bitterly at his death. ‘He was such a wonderful man,’ she said.

The
 incidents of alleged abuse in 1968 predated his fame by several years, 
although he was already a character actor, having not been born with 
conventional, leading-man good looks. But women found his energy and 
humour very attractive – in his early acting years one of his conquests 
was a young Judi Dench.

He 
met his first wife, the actress Josephine Tewson — best known as 
Hyacinth Bucket’s long-suffering neighbour in Keeping Up Appearances — 
while both worked at Salisbury Rep.

Their
 1959 marriage lasted a mere three years, Ms Tewson lamenting that in 
their brief time together ‘Len was always going off with other women and
 being uncaring’. He married Gillian in 1964, and apart from describing 
their marriage as ‘up and down’ — in other words, fairly normal — she 
has shed no light on any problems they may have had in their private 
life, certainly not his weakness for other women.

If
 Leonard Rossiter was indulging in extra-marital activities, they were 
carried on with remarkable care and discretion on both sides. Certainly,
 the acting world was never buzzing with any gossip.

As
 for his years at the BBC, the only gossip was about him being 
professionally ‘driven’, a demanding ‘monster’ and a ‘tetchy 
perfectionist’. Nothing very sexy there.

But
 in 2002, 18 years after his death, a letter fell on to his widow 
Gillian’s doormat, the contents of which were every bit as shocking, say
 friends, as the allegations now being made against her late husband.

The
 writer of the letter was Sue MacGregor, the Radio 4 presenter whose 
measured voice and unflappable professionalism have been familiar to 
listeners (particularly during her years on the Today programme) across 
middle-England for getting on for half a century.

Her
 reason for writing was that she had written her autobiography, and she 
felt she had to warn Gillian that she intended to describe (in some 
detail, as it turned out) her secret affair with Leonard that had gone 
on for five years until his death.

It
 transpired that at the height of his fame, in 1979, she had interviewed
 him on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. The next day he phoned and suggested 
they meet for a drink.

‘I 
was intrigued,’ wrote MacGregor in her book. ‘Could this be simply a 
postscript to our meeting of the day before . . . Or was he interested 
in something more?’

This 
was the beginning of an extraordinarily clandestine affair, their 
meetings always taking place at MacGregor’s Primrose Hill apartment. 
Being instantly recognisable, whenever he climbed the steps to her front
 door, Rossiter covered his face with a white handkerchief as though he 
was blowing his nose.

As for
 MacGregor, she said she wondered what her neighbours were making of 
this gentleman caller who always seemed to have a cold.

It
 was a regular, farcical scene that might have come straight out of a 
Rossiter sitcom, but this was serious. MacGregor, then aged 37 to his 
52, found him ‘quick, clever, funny and an enthusiastic bon viveur . . .
 I found him immensely attractive’.

From
 the start, however, he had made it plain he would never leave Gillian. 
Meanwhile, MacGregor, as with her close relationship with television inquisitor Sir Robin Day, assured him she was ‘a determinedly
 single soul’ — as she still is today at the age of 72.

But she was in love with him, admitting: ‘I did see other men from time to time but none of them seemed quite as attractive.’

For
 MacGregor, the secret visits were not enough, but, despite her tears, 
he could give no more. So she accepted the limitations.

Rossiter
 continued to visit her once a week, right up to his death. ‘I’m not 
proud of my relationship with Leonard,’ she said when promoting her 
memoir. ‘But I don’t regret it, because I loved him.’

Asked
 this week for a view on the allegations being made against Rossiter, 
MacGregor said: ‘I’m going to be really boring and say “No Comment”. I 
had hoped that [our affair] had, by now — if I may use the 
expression — gone to bed.’

Gillian
 has never commented on the broadcaster’s revelations. And the couple’s 
daughter, Camilla, who, at the time was as ‘horribly shocked’ as her 
mother, has loyally dismissed the saga of her father’s infidelity as 
something simply made up by Sue MacGregor in order to sell her book.

Camilla
 remembers him as a devoted father who enjoyed playing games and taking 
her to the park, a man so worried by reports of crashes involving school
 buses that he refused to let her join a school coach trip to Hastings 
but drove her there himself — and waited all day until it was time to 
bring her home.

So what does she think about these abuse claims against her father?

‘When
 someone’s dead,’ she says, ‘people can say what they like about them, 
can’t they? And the person can’t say anything to defend themselves.’
