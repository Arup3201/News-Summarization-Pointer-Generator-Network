One of the FBI's most wanted men is believed to be hiding out among Mormon church members, the agency has said.

Jason Derek Brown, 43, is being sought in the fatal shooting of an Arizona armored truck courier in 2004. The FBI is offering $100,000 for information on him.

The one-time Salt Lake City resident and Laguna Beach native could be taking advantage of philanthropic Mormon church members to remain at large, the FBI's lead agent on the case said.

The FBI believe Brown could have targeted Mormons because he once was a devout follower of the religion and could easily integrate.

He served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in France in 1988 after being ordained into the religion by his grandfather.

Although he returned to his native Laguna Beach after the mission, got married and lived the LDS lifestyle, he is believed to have abandoned the church in the Nineties.

He left his wife and became interested in fast cars, nightclubs, women and alcohol, running up thousands of dollars in debt, according to the dailybeast.com.

Blending in: With his 'surfer dude' persona and generic name, Brown has evaded the FBI for eight years

Brown is accused of shooting Robert 
Keith Palomares five times in the head at close range with a .45-caliber
 handgun on November 29, 2004, outside a Phoenix theater.

The last confirmed sighting of Brown, a former toy salesman, was in August 2008.

A
 friend spotted the fugitive at a stoplight near the Hogle Zoo in Salt 
Lake City, where he lived just months prior to the murder.

Brown bought a handgun at a Kearns gun store two weeks before the crime and the weapon was later linked to Palomares' death.

He is a skilled liar and convincing people that he's someone else. He could be taking advantage of a Mormon church member's philanthropy and be using an alias, FBI Agent Lance Leising said.

Leising said Brown's ability to blend in is one reason he's on the Top 10 Most Wanted list.

'With the commonness of his name and how he looks, like a surfer dude in California, we've had more tips (about this) fugitive than any other on America's Most Wanted.

'It's caused us to chase leads all around the world,' Leising said.

Brown has an uncanny resemblance to the actor Sean Penn - a fact that once led to the actor's body double being arrested after police thought he was Brown.

He later earned a master's degree in business, started two companies and is fluent in French.

An Arizona arrest warrant was issued in 2004 charging Brown with first-degree murder and armed robbery.

Brown was later charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in a federal arrest warrant.

The matching fingerprints came from an application Brown submitted weeks earlier in Utah for a concealed-weapons permit.

Utah authorities held the license because of the shooting and it was never issued.

The fugitive is 5'10' and weighs 170-180lbs, with blond hair and green eyes. Although it is suspected he is in Utah and was last seen in Salt Lake City, other possible locations include Mexico, Laguna Beach, California and the west Coast of Canada where he has been known to vacation in the past.
