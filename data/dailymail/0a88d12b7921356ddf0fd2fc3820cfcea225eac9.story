Death: James Douglas-Home, the nephew of former prime minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home (pictured) has killed himself at the age of 61

The nephew of former prime minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home has shot himself dead.

Former racehorse trainer James 
Douglas-Home, 61, was found by his sister at his home in rural Oxfordshire after suffering 'months of depression', an inquest heard.

Sarah Dent went to his large house in East Lockinge, near Wantage, and discovered her brother's body in a bedroom.

Coroner Darren Salter said today he had 'shot himself in the head'.

The widower, who was the 28th Baron Dacre, was said to have been suffering severe depression since March and died days before his 62nd birthday.

His wife Christine died in 2008 and the aristocrat is 
survived by his only child, Emily, who has assumed the title 29th 
Baroness Dacre following his death.

Mr Douglas-Home trained horses in the 1970s and 1980s, and later wrote a book on the subject and articles for The Field magazine, a publication celebrating country life and pursuits.

His father, William Douglas-Home, was a playwright and politician.

His uncle was the 14th Earl of Home, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who succeeded Harold Macmillan as prime minister when he fell ill in October 1963.

The aristocrat Tory leader was in Downing Street for just under 12 months, until he lost the General Election to Harold Wilson's Labour Party.

The current Earl of Home is Sir Alec's son David Douglas-Home, chairman of Coutts bank, who sits in the House of Lords.

The Earl's children Lady Mary and Iona Douglas-Home, are friends of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and are second cousins of James's daughter Emily, who lives in south-west London.

Tragedy: Mr Douglas-Home's body was discovered by his sister Sarah at his property in Lockinge, Oxfordshire

News of Mr Douglas-Home's sudden death has been met with sadness among friends in the horse racing world today.

Trainer James Fanshawe, who owns Pegasus Stables in Newmarket, said: 'I was so sad to hear that a good friend, Jamie Douglas Home, had died.

'We all used to have such fun with him and his wife Christine, especially during Royal Ascot week when a gang of us used to stay with them.

'He was very amusing and the best host, and he will be missed by all his friends and especially so by his daughter Emily.

'He was a very talented writer and wrote books and also for The Field magazine. Christine sadly died six years ago. They were a fantastic couple.'

A full inquest into his death will be held on August 26.
