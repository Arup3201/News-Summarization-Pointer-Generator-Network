England could call Bath centre Jonathan Joseph into their 38-man squad on Wednesday following the recurrence of Manu Tuilagi’s groin injury.

The Leicester centre was forced off after 15 minutes of the 25-18 European Champions Cup win over Ulster, leaving England coach Stuart Lancaster with further injury problems ahead of next month’s four Tests.

Luther Burrell, Brad Barritt, Kyle Eastmond and Billy Twelvetrees are all expected to be named in the Elite Player Squad this week, but Tuilagi’s latest setback could open the door for Joseph, who has not played for England in more than 16 months.

‘It’s a recurrence of his groin injury, which is not great,’ said Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill. 

‘That was three weeks (out) last time. It’s going to be an issue for him, with us, and obviously the autumn series. He just went to accelerate and he felt his groin go.

'The way he plays, you can’t play with that sort of problem.’

Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Mako Vunipola, Tom Youngs, Ed Slater, Geoff Parling, Louis Deacon, Tom Croft, Tom Johnson and Anthony Allen are already among the injured ahead of the Tests against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia.
