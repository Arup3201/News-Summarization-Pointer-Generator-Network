Chicago police used excessive and brutal force on a 5'2" woman and told her they'd ship her back to 'where the f*** she came from,' according to a lawsuit filed by a Chinese-born American citizen on Wednesday.

Shocking video shows Jianqing 'Jessica' Klyzek being struck in the head as the non-native English speaker struggled against police, most of them in plain clothes, as they raided the tanning salon where Klyzek worked last summer.

Klyzek is suing the City of Chicago and its police department alleging police brutality and a hate crime and with trying to frame the salon manager by claiming she was the one who assaulted them.

Lawsuit: Shocking video purports to show racist Chicago police officers screaming at a tanning salon manager during a vice bust gone wrong

Allegations: Klyzek's lawsuit alleges that she was handled by police with excessive force and mistreated because of her ethnicity

Police had entered the spa last July after claiming one of its employees--not Klyzek--offered an undercover cop sex in exchange for money in a back room.

Klyzek walks into view of the camera as one of the officers grabs her by the arm.

Her attorney Torreya Hamilton admits her client reacted emotionally and footage shows her struggling as she dragged by her arm.

But when she's cuffed and on the ground, an officer annoyed by her screaming can clearly be seen to smack her on the back of the head.Â 

Another officer then goes on a tirade as his fellow cops are presumably raiding the back.

'You're not
 f***ing American,' yells the officer identified in the suit as Gerald 
Di Pasquale. 'I'll put you in a UPS box and send you back to wherever 
the f*** you came from!'

The yelling continues after Klyzek tells officers, 'I'm a citizen, okay?':

'No,
 you're not! You're here on our borrowed time. So mind your f--king 
business before I shut this whole f--king place down. And I'll take this
 place and then whoever owns it will f--king kill you because they don't
 care about you, OK? I'll take this building. You'll be dead and your 
family will be dead,' the officer says.

Racism? While she screamed and demanded to know what she'd done, footage from the incident clearly show an officer screaming threats and allegations that Klyzek, who is a naturalized citizen, is not an American

An officer can clearly be seen striking the 5-foot-2 woman in the back of the head as she was kneeled down in handcuffs and facing the floor

Another officer is heard to yell: 'Can I just Tase her? F*** it. I can Tase her 10 f***ing times.'

The officer who allegedly struck Klyzek is identified in the case as Frank Messina.

Besides Messina and Di Pasquale, the case names Sandra Stoppa, Daniel Sako, Michael Iglesias, Sergio Flores, D. Puhar, T. Jackson, Eugene Sledge and Kenneth Corcoran as defendant officers and alleges they attempted to frame Klyzek by claiming she's the one who assaulted them.

However, the case against Klyzek was thrown out for lack of evidence and because prosecutors dropped charges when they saw the video.

The sex worker who allegedly propositioned an officer has also since had her misdemeanor conviction expunged.

Hamilton is seeking to get the officers fired.
