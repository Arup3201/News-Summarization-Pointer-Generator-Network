A massive fireball hurtled above Californian on Wednesday night in what forecasters said was most likely a meteor streaking across the sky.

Residents from Santa Barbara to San Diego reported seeing the dazzling sight from around 8pm, the National Weather Service said.

Witnesses calling news stations and posting on Twitter mistook it for flashing cameras, fireworks and even UFOs as it sped across the clear night sky, flashing brightly and leaving a fiery trail.

Dave Morgan from San Dimas told NBC4: 'It was so large and the trail was so big and the explosion was pretty amazing - I just went "Woah". It looked like it fell behind the trees and sort of exploded.'

Fireball: Hundreds of Californians reported seeing a massive fireball moving across the sky on Wednesday

Glowing: At one point the meteor glowed brighter, pictured. It was likely part of the South Taurids meteor shower which is expected to be active for the first couple of weeks of November

The sightings were most likely 
associated with the South Taurids meteor shower that has been especially
active in early November and make meteor sighting four or five times as
likely.

The debris is coming from Comet Encke, which is currently passing through the solar system.

Astronomers
say the Taurids don't bring big numbers of visible meteors but a high 
percentage of extremely bright ones that look like fireballs.

Twitter lit up with reports of the sightings, but only a few were able to capture the streak on video.

Comedian Eli Braden tweeted that he 'just
saw an absolutely INSANE meteor in the sky above Glendale, CA ... 
Either that or the alien invasion has begun'.

One
video sent to NBC4 was taken from a parking lot and shows a bright 
white dot soaring across the sky, flashing before it zooms behind some 
trees.

Shock: Dave Morgan from San Dimas said the meteor left a large trail before disappearing behind trees

'I saw the meteor. It was huge and broke into three large pieces,' viewer Jonathan said.

Another viewer, George, said he saw a fast-moving object that 'burned in the atmosphere with a trail of debris'.

There were no reports of the meteor impacting the ground or causing any injuries.

But meteors can do serious damage. In February, a meteor moved above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia, causing as many as 1,600 injuries as it outshone the sun and burned residents.

The shockwave also blew out windows and suspended ceilings were sucked down from buildings. Other injuries included cuts from glass, concussion and retinal burns.

It traveled at around 11.6 miles a second as it moved across the earth and was the largest object to hit Earth since 1908.
