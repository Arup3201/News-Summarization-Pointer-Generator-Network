As she natters over tea and cakes with other ladies in the village, Donna Smith looks just like any other pensioner.

But incredibly Donna, 74, used to be a man called Donald.

And five years ago, at the age of 69, he became the oldest person in the UK to undergo a full sex change operation.

Reborn: Donna, 74, is now delighted that she is a woman after spending 69 years of her life as Donald, right

'Most people have no idea I used to be a he,' reveals Donna, in her first ever interview, 'and some people might wonder why at such a late age I bothered to go through such a major operation.

'But I’m proof it’s never too late to change your sex. Being a woman is fantastic. Just knowing I will die as a proper woman has come as a huge relief.'

Now Donna, who as a woman is still a virgin, has one more goal – she would love to meet a toyboy: 'Although I’m in my seventies most people comment I don’t look a day over 50.

'I’d love to have a male companion to grow old with, a man ideally younger than me, to share the rest of my life with.'

Donna’s long and torturous journey to become female began early in childhood when as Donald Edmund Bodsworth she loved nothing more than to dress up in her mum’s high-heeled shoes.

'I loved to try her make up too,' recalls Donna, the middle of three children, 'but it caused endless upset in the family.

'My parents were horrified. Both of them would tell me off and although I regularly told them I wanted to be a little girl, they would just reply, "don’t be so stupid."'

By the time Donna reached her teens she’d experienced terrible bullying at school. 'My nickname was querie,' she says, 'girls and boys were both wary of me and I had few friends.

Also at risk: Charing Cross Hospital is one of several hospitals still at risk from the Shaping A Healthier Future series of reforms which are currently out to consultation

'A few girls did fancy me but I didn’t fancy women at all. And then although I did fancy some men, I used to fantasise about being their girlfriend, not wanting them as another man.

'Meanwhile, dad, a man’s man, who was a bricklayer before he became a prison officer, tried to toughen me up by taking me onto building sites with him. I hated it so much I used to cry myself to sleep.'

Consequently, at the age of 17, and having saved up some money by working in the kitchens of a local hotel, Donna left the Bedfordshire village where they lived and moved to London.

But the prejudices just continued.

'I was so unhappy at home, I’d longed to get away,' she recalls, 'but the first few nights I ended up sleeping rough on the streets. Thankfully I then found the YMCA.'

Donna found another job working in kitchens. But even there she didn’t fit in.

'People didn’t warm to me,' she says, 'the problem was my feminine side just came through all the time. By now I felt sure I was a woman trapped in a man’s body.

'Yet it was the 50s and it was shocking for a man to be feminine like me and absolutely unacceptable. Once I went out and literally got a good kicking just because a bloke took said I looked like a poof.'

However, she was so worried that in 
her early twenties she saw her GP. 'I told him I thought I’d been born 
into the wrong body,' she said.

He
 referred her to Charing Cross Hospital’s Gender clinic where she was 
seen by Dr John Randell, a pioneering doctor in transgenderism.

Happy at last: Donna Smith is now living in the Lincolnshire coastal town of Mablethorpe

She says: 'For the first time someone understood what I was going through. Until then I’d felt a freak so it was a relief to know there were others like me.'

After undergoing a barrage of medical and psychological tests, Donna was put on hormones.

'The idea was that the hormones would make me feel more feminine and because of that I would feel more comfortable within my body,' she says.

Within weeks breasts had started to grow, her beard was less noticeable and her penis had started to shrink.

'But while I felt better about myself and happier inside, attitudes weren’t like they are today. These days I’ve read about people having a sex change and then turning up to work dressed as the opposite sex.

'Had I turned up to work dressed as a woman it would have been a national scandal. I’d have been instantly sacked.'

And so a new life developed. 'I would dress as a man to go to work,' she says, 'and then when I got home put on my wig, a dress and make up.'

Amazingly she even entered a beauty pageant for women. 'I always wore a lovely long blonde wig. I was so convincing I actually came third. Even then that no-one guessed anything was unusual about me – and in fact doing that beauty pageant gave me a boost – because I knew for sure then I’d been born in the wrong body.'

But most of the time life was fraught with difficulty.

'I lived in fear of meeting someone from work and them recognizing me. Or, just as bad someone realizing I wasn’t actually a woman and marching me off to the police. Then everything had to be done under cover.'

For the next twenty years Donna continued living as a man by day and a woman by night.

By her early thirties she had also fallen in love with a man in his twenties and they began living together.

'We
 lived together as husband and wife but to the outside world he was my 
lodger,' she says, 'it was sad that we had to pretend to others we 
weren’t a couple but society was not accepting as it is now.

'Just coming out as gay was almost unheard of let alone as a man living as a woman. In those days that was how it had to be.'

However,
 when Donna reached her late 40s he broke her heart. 'He left me for 
another woman,' she says, 'it was terrible as I couldn’t even confide in
 anyone about why I was so devastated.'

By
 now Donna had read about someone having a sex change and when she asked
 her doctors they agreed she could have one – but there was a long 
waiting list and she would have to live and work as a woman day and 
night for several years before she’d qualify.

Donna says: 'It was probably the hardest time because as a woman it was impossible to get a job. I couldn’t lie – work places always needed to see things like birth certificates and yet I couldn’t afford not to work either.

'Also as a man working I earned more than if I’d worked as a woman.'

Although she managed initially to gain a job as a woman working in a factory, when that job ended she found herself working on the roads and then at Vauxhall motors in Luton.

'Working as a man meant I got so much more money,' she says, 'I had bills to pay so I ended up back in the old cycle of dressing as a man in the day and a woman at night.

'By now the hormones had made my breasts grow to a 44DD – it was agony as I had to flatten them with tight vests.'

However, finally when Donna retired she was able to live properly as a woman and fulfil the criteria. 'After I retired at 65 I could live full time as a woman and finally at the age of 69 I got to the top of the NHS waiting list.

'I couldn't believe it - but for me it was better late than never.'

And in June 2006 at Charing Cross hospital she finally underwent the five-hour surgery she’d longed for. The penis and testicles were removed and a vagina was formed.

'I remember the nurse waking up me up. She said, "You’re a Miss now” and immediately I put my hand between my legs. The thrill that I was so neat and flat was fantastic.

'It really felt as if I were being reborn, the start of a new life.'

She moved to the seaside and today lives in a two-bed flat in Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, bought with redundancy pay from her job at Vauxhall.

She says: 'A handful of people who’ve known me a long time do obviously know I used to be a man, but most people have absolutely no idea.

'The only thing I think people find unusual is I still have quite a husky voice when I speak. It’s strange because my body is so feminine – other women often comment for example on my legs, which are one of my best features.

'But being a proper woman has changed my life. I feel so much more confident – I have lots of friends who I have cups of tea with and chat with and I’m a great carer.

'I've always been a motherly sort of person and now I look after a 96-year-old lady who lives nearby.'

Now there is only one thing left to do. 'The doctors tell me everything is in working order but I’ve yet to find my Mr Right,' she says, 'and meeting someone special would make my life perfect.'
