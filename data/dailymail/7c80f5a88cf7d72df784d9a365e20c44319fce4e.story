The Queen joined forces with Dame Penelope Keith for a meeting of the Women's Institute (WI) this morning.

Resplendent in a silver tweed coat, the 88-year-old monarch was all smiles as she arrived for the event at West Newton village hall close to her Sandringham home.

Her Majesty, who is patron of the WI, joins members for a post-Christmas meeting every year towards the end of her annual winter break.

Dame Penelope, who also starred in the TV series To The Manor Born as well as The Good Life, was guest speaker at the event.

Wearing a light grey checked overcoat. The Queen was welcomed by the group’s chairwoman, Yvonne Browne, and members sang the National Anthem as she entered.

Before the meeting, Dame Penelope said: 'I’m a little bit nervous but it’s a great privilege to be invited to do this.

'I have had the pleasure of meeting the Queen before but this is a great honour because I’m a great admirer of hers.

'I am never quite sure what to speak about - people expect actors to just have a torrent of words coming out of them.

'What I like to do is answer questions so we’ll see what people would like me to talk about.'

As part of the meeting, the Queen judged competition entries from members. Afterwards, she returned to Sandringham House.

She and the Duke of Edinburgh will remain at Sandringham, which is in Norfolk, until the beginning of February.

The Queen wore a gorgeous silver coat for the event with black gloves to keep out the cold
