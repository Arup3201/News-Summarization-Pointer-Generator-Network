Brutal crime: Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier has been charged with killing her newborn baby by setting her ablaze on Friday night on Simontown Road in New Jersey

The woman accused of dousing her newborn daughter with WD40, setting her on fire and leaving her in the middle of a road to die has made her first court appearance on a murder charge.

Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier, 22, did not enter a plea during a hearing Tuesday in Mount Holly. But the 22-year-old Pemberton Township woman said she planned to soon hire an attorney.

The judge maintained her $500,000 bail, which was set after police found the baby in flames on Friday night in the middle of a residential road. 

Dorvilier was found with a can of WD-40 and a lighter in her jacket pocket, and the baby suffered third-degree burns over about 60 percent of her body, investigators said in court documents released by Burlington County prosecutors on Tuesday.

The baby still had an umbilical cord and placenta attached, investigators said.

Prosecutors haven't revealed a motive, and it isn't clear if she has an attorney. 

There was no answer at the two-story yellow house where Dorvilier lived with her mother and sister on a quiet suburban street in Pemberton, a town of about 28,000.

Police were responding to a call about a fire on a residential road in the township on Friday night, about 30 miles east of Philadelphia. 

When they arrived, they found a neighbor holding Dorvilier down on the ground and the baby wrapped in a smoldering towel and paper, according to the court documents.

The baby was alive and breathing when she was flown to a hospital in Philadelphia, but she died two hours later.

Scene: Witnesses say 22-year-old mother got out of her car and stopped in the middle of Simontown Road in Pemberton Township, New Jersey, on Friday night and burned the child alive

Response: Medics rushed to the scene and airlifted the young child to St Christopher's Hospital in Philadelphia with severe burns. It succumbed to its injuries a short time later 

Dave Joseph, who discovered the burning baby and held Dorvilier down, told police that the woman said the baby wasn't hers. 

Police said they found a trail of blood leading from Dorvilier's home and she appeared to be bleeding while at the hospital afterward.

Her mother and sister told police that they were not aware of her giving birth, but police said they found blood on the floor of the downstairs bathroom.

Joseph said the woman told him she was burning dog waste.

'It was just mind-boggling,' Joseph told the Burlington County Times. 'It was a nightmare even if you have a strong heart.'
