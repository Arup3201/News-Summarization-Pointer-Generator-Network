A Christmas tree planted by a couple in their front garden more than 30 years ago has become a village landmark as it has grown to tower above their house.

When Avril Rowlands, 67, and husband Christopher, 68, bought the small pine tree for just £6 from a garden centre in 1978 they hardly expected it to be standing higher than 40ft tall 34 years later.

The couple planted the 6ft tree outside their new home in the village of Inkberrow, Worcestershire, and took a photograph to commemorate the occasion.

Through the years: Avril and Christopher Rowlands planted the tree when it stood at just 6ft tall after moving to their new home 34 years ago

Standing tall: The tree now towers over the couple's home after growing to more than 40ft tall

Small beginnings: The couple bought the tree for £6 and took a picture to commemorate the occasion

But after more than 30 years of dedicated care it is still standing proud at 42 ft tall, and it is still growing.

The tree has become so big it now towers over the couple's home and has become a focal point for the local community.

Each year it is decorated with more than 1,000 traditional tungsten bulbs using a cherry picker loaned by a local firm.

And for the last three years the couple have held on switch-on event which many villagers now see at the start of the festive period.

Television writer Avril said: 'My husband and I moved up to the village from London in 1978 for a more meaningful life.

'We saw that the local post office had a Christmas tree which was covered in fairy lights and it really stood out.

'Because of our position in the village we decided to do the same thing so planted the tree when we moved in.

'It's safe to say we weren't expecting it to still be standing almost 40 years later, nor to have grown to such a height. It's become a bit of a village landmark.

'For the last three years we've had a
switch-on event with a fairground organ and a steam traction engine - 
the owner heats up mince pies in the boiler.

'A lot of people in the village say that it's the start of their Christmas.

'We even get cards addressed to the tree which is quite sweet.'

Mr and Mrs Rowlands used a single string of Christmas lights to decorate 
the tree during the early 1980s but as it grew the couple had to buy 
more and more lights.

Helping hand: Decorating the Christmas tree in time for the festive season takes a major effort each year

Charity: All the effort is worth it as the couple raise money for the Cancer Research and Worcestershire Royal Hospital Cardiac Care Unit

Last year they raised more than £1,000 for Cancer Research and Worcestershire Royal Hospital Cardiac Care Unit, which saved Chris's life after he suffered a heart attack.

This year the couple have chosen to raise money for Midlands Air Ambulance.

Retired BBC editor Mr Rowlands said: 'After a few years we realised the tree was growing taller and taller and getting more and more attention, so we decided we'd like to use it to raise money for charity.

'We are very proud of the tree and it does look incredible each year with the lights on it.'

Inkberrow is one of a handful of villages in the country which doesn't have any street lights and the tree can be seen from a mile away at night when it is lit up.

A spokesman for the Forestry Commission said: 'This is a remarkable tree which has obviously been taken care of.

'Pine trees can grow to huge heights so time will only tell if this one grows any larger.'

Visible: The tree can be seen for miles around when lit up as the village doesn't have any street lights
