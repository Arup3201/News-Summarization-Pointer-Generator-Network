Keeping the Faith: Jon Bon Jovi is staying loyal to Bills owner Ralph Wilson and will not buy the team

Rock legend Jon Bon Jovi is not trying to be the next owner of the Buffalo Bills, he insists - despite wanting to own a football team.

CBS Sports claimed the New Jersey rocker was among those jostling to be the team's second-ever owner after 95-year-old founder and owner Ralph Wilson.

But the rocker's publicist Ken Sunshine said: 'The Bills are not for sale, and he has too much respect for Mr Wilson to engage in any discussions of buying the team.'

He added Bon Jovi had 'a day job that's doing very well' and said: 'It's preposterous to say he's had any discussions with the Bills and Erie County.'

Despite his advanced years Mr Wilson, a founding owner of the American Football League, refuses to give up ownership of team until his death.

But he has famously ruled out the possibility of his family taking over the 54-year tenure when he is gone.

Selling the Bills will take several years, as the franchise will be operated through a trust.

Mr Sunshine did not deny Bon Jovi's interest in one day being an NFL owner - saying his client has made that no secret.

Bon Jovi has developed relationships with several NFL power-brokers, including New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.

He established an Arena Football team in Philadelphia in 2004 which he owned until 2009, when the AFL folded for one season.

But Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz issued a statement saying he has had no discussions with Bon Jovi.

The Bills also released a statement saying: 'The organization does not respond to reports of the interest other parties may have in ownership or of speculation concerning various groups that may have such interest.'

Mr Sunshine also denied reports that Bon Jovi has ramped up an NFL search after the dismissal in April of his band's longtime lead guitarist, Richie Sambora.

He said the guitarist was never fired and was instead dropping out of the band's world tour due to 'personal issues'.

Mr Wilson, who lives in suburban Detroit, has already scaled back his control of the team.

On January 1, Russ Brandon was promoted to the position of team president, giving him full control of the franchise's day-to-day operations.

The team's short-term future in Buffalo was also secured in December, when the Bills signed a 10-year lease to continue playing at their Ralph Wilson Stadium.

The $271 million deal locks the Bills in to playing at the stadium financially for at least seven years.

Several groups have expressed interest in purchasing the Bills, including one led by Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly.
