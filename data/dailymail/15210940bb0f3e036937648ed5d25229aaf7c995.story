With a loving husband, perfect little boy and stellar modelling career, Lara Stone seems to have it all.

But the stunning Dutch supermodel, 30, confesses that she suffered body insecurities and feared for her job while she was pregnant.

In fact Lara says she hated pregnancy and found the changes her body went through 'quite shocking'.

She found the changes her body went through 'quite shocking', but got back into shape with a trainer

Wearing 
maternity jeans at 10 weeks, she had to stop modelling quite early on.

Lara feared the potential impact carrying a child would have on her body - and her career.

But after a year off to look after her 14-month-old Alfred, she landed right back on her feet after as the face of L'Oréal.

'Being
 pregnant affected my work quite early on - it's not like you can work 
until you're eight months pregnant. It was quite frightening seeing my 
body change so much,' she tells the Sunday Times Style magazine.

'Yes,
 I did worry about the impact, because my body is my job and my 
livelihood. Also, I like working and I don't like sitting around at 
home, so I really wanted to get back into things. It's nice once the 
baby's here, but then I was like, "I really want to do something 
again." '

She also said that she and David sometimes leave Alfred for days with their nanny, as neither of their families live nearby to help out with Alfred.

'My family doesn't live near and my husband's family lives a couple of hours away, and both of our jobs are so unpredictable,' she says.

'Sometimes there is nothing you can do and you have to leave him with the nanny for a couple of days.'

The model holds an exclusive contract with Calvin Klein now, and clearly has nothing to worry about these days

She 
recently opened up about the moment she arrived for a modelling shoot 
and was told she was no longer needed, shortly after announcing she was 
in the early stages of pregnancy.

She said: 'I was really upset at the time. I hadn't yet had my three-month scan and I felt really vulnerable about everything.

'I no longer had a job. That was it - I had to just stop everything that I knew, the way my life was.'

And
 things didn't change after her baby son arrived, she told Porter: 'I've
 had a few meetings because when they hear pregnancy they freak out a 
bit, so they need to see if I fit in their clothes.

'Everyone's
 so nice to you all the time. And it's like, "Ugh," you don't have to 
be. It feels quite alienating because it's like everyone's just lying to
 you.'

The proud parents are holidaying in St Tropez and still looked very much smitten

But the model, who holds exclusive contracts with Calvin Klein and L'Oreal Paris, clearly has nothing to worry about these days, as she's regained her knockout figure with the help of celebrity trainer James Duigan.

She left little Alfred at home to take a stroll and soak up the scorching sun on the French Riviera with British comedian husband David Walliams, 42.

The proud parents are holidaying in St Tropez and still looked very much smitten as they walked down the streets together hand in hand, keeping close to one another at all times.

At one point, the lovebirds stopped outside one shop for a quick breather, where Lara towered over the Britian's Got Talent judge to give him an affectionate kiss.

David channeled his wife's attire by wearing an all-white ensemble as he carried a fair few shopping bags with him, after what looked like a successful spree.

Meanwhile Lara looked incredible in a loose-fitting white mini-dress and strappy black sandals, which highlighted her toned legs perfectly.
