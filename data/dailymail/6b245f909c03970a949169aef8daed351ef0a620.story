With a bright complexion and a twinkle in her eye, Camilla is clearly still enjoying that holiday glow.

The Duchess of Cornwall looked the picture of health as she accompanied Prince Charles on the Jubilee tour of Papua New Guinea - no doubt thanks to her recent luxury break in southern India.

Camilla spent a week at the Soukya International Holistic Centre in Bangalore, where she is thought to have stayed in the centre's £3,500-a-night presidential suite, ahead of the three week Royal tour.

As a yoga devotee, she is likely to have taken advantage of customised dawn yoga sessions and 'spiritually healing' massages in the Ayurveda tradition, a Hindu system of medicine.

She was introduced to yoga by Prince Charles's holistic health guru Dr Mosaraf Ali before their wedding in 2005.

Prince Charles and Camilla arrived 
at a cultural welcoming ceremony where they were greeted by local 
tribesmen in warrior outfits, covered in clay and terrifying headmasks, as they began their second day in Papua New Guinea.

The Royal couple were received by a 
rapturous welcome as thousands of wellwishers gathered to catch a 
glimpse of the pair on their first leg of a two-week tour to mark the 
Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

The
 Prince of Wales endeared himself to the nation when he spoke in Pidgin 
English while the Duchess of Cornwall received an unexpected kiss from 
an admirer when they visited a local village.

This morning the couple attended a 
ceremony staged in the Sir John Guise football stadium in the capital 
Port Moresby. They arrived at the event on two armchairs in a pickup 
truck.

The pair were greeted by traditional dancers donning grass skirts, leaves, and fascinating headdresses.

Prince Charles garnered huge cheers when he began speaking in pidgin.

Referring

 to himself by his pidgin name, nambawan pikinini bilong misis kwin - 
which means the number one child of the Queen, he paid tribute to 'the 
extraordinary 
courage' of the country's Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels, who aided Australian 
troops during
 World War II.

And using the pidjin term in his own speech of greeting, he referred to the Duchess as his ‘misis’.

After giving the greetings on behalf of the Queen,
 the crowd of several thousand shouted a resounding 'yes' when he asked 
in the native language 'was my pidgin all right?'

Charles

 is colonel-in-chief of the Royal Pacific Islands Regiment, which he 
saluted during his speech at the stadium as he presented the unit with 
new colours.

At the end of a church service in the
stadium, the couple wandered among lines of tribespeople 
dressed in their warrior outfits, feathers and grass skirts.

For Camilla, who has never visited 
the country, the sight of semi-naked men with bodies and faces daubed in
 paint as they danced and chanted in her presence seemed overwhelming at
 first, but she soon adopted a grin as she strolled through the 
colourful groups.

Both the Prince and the Duchess 
stopped to stare at the mud men, whose heads were covered in frightening
 masks, while their bodies were daubed with grey clay.

The group’s leader, 34-year-old Bruce Mathias, said:
 ‘All the tribes from the highlands have their different markings and we
 have worn these masks and put clay on our bodies for centuries.'

Following the performance, Charles 
and Camilla travelled to the fishing village of Boera, about 20 minutes 
away from Port Moresby, where Charles planted a
 small mangrove tree on a pristine beach.

Stepping
 out of their vehicle, the pair were greeted by men in traditional dress
 performing an aggressive war dance to welcome them.

The men were armed with ceremonial weapons while young women waved grass skirts.

They took a tour of the village, viewing an aid station and local craft market while chatting with residents.

During the visit the Duchess of Cornwall received an unexpected token of affection from an admirer.

Jenny
 Lohia gave Camilla a peck on the cheek when she placed a necklace of 
valuable shells around the royal's neck as a welcoming present to the 
coastal settlement.

The Duchess proudly wore the piece 
that featured a large mother of pearl shell while the Prince of Wales 
was handed a similar gift which had two highly prized boar tusks.

Ms Lohia, a 24-year-old clerk who 
works for a liquid natural gas company, was topless and dressed in a 
sago leaf skirt and body paintings when she made the presentation to the
 Duchess.

She afterwards: 'She was happy when I 
kissed her. I just gave her a kiss because it was the first time I had 
seen her and Charles.

'I'm so proud of myself for giving her that kiss - it's one in a million.

'I feel so proud of my village, they could have gone anywhere but they came here.'

This is 
Prince Charles’s fourth trip to Papua New Guinea. He first visited in 
1966.

Today he was 
greeted with a hug by Father Lucas - whom the Prince met 46 years ago on
 his first visit to the country when he was just 17. They had shared a 
specially-built garden house in a remote school in the north of the 
country.

At first Charles, 63, did not recognise 
his old classmate when they met at the royal's hotel in Port Moresby but
 when the Prince realised who the 64-year-old priest was,
 the two men hugged.

Prince Charles broke away
from the priest’s hug to tell him with a grin: ‘I’m afraid we’ve both got
old and grey.’

Camilla, who has never visited the country, grins as she strolls past the colourful topless women dancing

Father
Lucas recalled later that that he and his
school friends from the Martyrs Memorial School in the north of the country had
built a special garden house when they learned that the teenage Prince was
coming to visit in 1966.

He said: ‘We built a
special bed for him, using local bush materials and in the evenings during his
short stay he and I sat in the house and he told me wonderful stories of
growing up in that big palace of his in London.

‘I gave him
what for me at the time was a special gift of a wooden comb and he gave me a
nice tortoiseshell comb in return.'

Charles travelled to Papua New Guinea 
as part of a school trip during his time at Timbertop, a remote annexe 
of Geelong Church of England Grammar School in Melbourne.

Later on in the day Charles walks through Boera village, 13miles west of Port Moresby

In tribute to his royal friend, Father
 Lucas, whose parish church is in Sefoa in the south-east of the 
country, named his son after Charles and when he and wife Jean adopted 
two boys they named them Andrew and Edward after the Queen's other two 
sons.

Father Lucas joked: 'I've got a small group of royals living in my home.'

The Royal couple
 will spend three days in Papua New Guinea before travelling to 
Australia, and will wrap up their trip in New Zealand, where Charles 
will celebrate his 64th birthday on November 14.

That visit will include a traditional 
Maori welcome, which involves the hongi, or pressing of noses, and the 
couple will inspect costumes from the new Peter Jackson film, The 
Hobbit.
