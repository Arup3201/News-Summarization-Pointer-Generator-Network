Fundraising site GoFundMe shut down a campaign supporting an Oklahoma cop accused of rape and stalking Tuesday in the face of criticism.

Daniel Holtzclaw, 27, an Oklahoma City police officer, is behind bars at Oklahoma County Jail after being charged on multiple counts including rape by eight women.

The fundraising page titled 'Justice for Daniel Holtzclaw' was set up by his sister Jenny on August 24 to help with his legal fees and states that Holtzclaw 'not only DESERVES but is required by the law to be given a Presumption of Innocence.'

On the beat: Victims claimed Daniel Holtzclaw sexually assaulted them during traffic stops under threat of violence or arrest

The page gathered just over $7,000 but also attracted its share of critics, being shut down on Tuesday without an explanation from the company about what terms were violated.

'In the event that a campaign receives a high volume of complaints, GoFundMe will conduct an internal content review to determine the most appropriate course of action,' a spokesperson for GoFundMe told the Ann Arbor News.

The company notably allowed two fundraising campaigns for officer Darren Wilson, who shot an unarmed teen in Ferguson, Missouri, to go forward. The campaigns have both stopped taking donations.

The fight has moved over to the Facebook page set up for Holtzclaw, where the family has been 'deleting horrible comments,' it told CNN.

The former college football player was put on administrative leave back in June after a woman claimed she was sexually assaulted during a traffic stop.

According to the Daily News, the 57-year-old grandmother alleged that Holtzclaw ordered her to perform oral sex on him.

In the investigation that followed, Oklahoma City police located six other women, all African-American, that identified Holtzclaw in a array of offenses. An eighth woman came forward after his arrest.

The Huffington Post reports Holtzclaw threatened arrest or physical harm against his alleged victims. 

According to Ann Arbor News, the judge originally ordered Holtzclaw held on a $5million bond, stating he conducted research on his victims before assaults. The bond was later reduced to $500,000.

KOCO reports the investigation found Holtzclaw ran the names of victims shortly before the alleged assaults.

Holtzclaw also ran the names the day after to see if the women reported him, according to investigators. 

On the 'Justice for Daniel Holtzclaw' Facebook pages, the family states 'the money that has been collected for Daniel’s defense is secure and we are currently exploring other options to use in order to aid in Daniel’s legal fees and bail' and that they're exploring other fundraising options.

A post from September 3 on the Facebook page claimed the allegations against Holtzclaw are 'false.'
