Lying on the bed, I try to relax as my therapist massages tea tree cleanser into my skin, before wiping toner across my cheeks.

While this might sound like a run of the mill beauty treatment, it's not. I'm face down on the couch, and it's not my face that's getting a pampering.

It's, um, my bottom. That's right, I'm having a 'bacial' - a bottom facial - which, according to those in the know, is this season's hottest beauty therapy.

'Lit up like a rainbow': Kim under the LED lamp which is said to correct pigmentation and encourage circulation

I blame Cheryl Cole, Kelly Brook and Lady Gaga. They've spearheaded the trend for 'belfies' - self-portraits of one's posterior, posted on social media.

As a result, bottoms are taking centre stage, with one London salon group reporting that, in the past few months, they have seen a 200 per cent rise in enquiries for the treatments.

'Many of those undergoing the bum facials said they were motivated by seeing celebrities' perfect behinds on Twitter or Instagram,' says Esther Fieldgrass, CEO of EF Medispa.

'One of the most common complaints is a spotty bottom. While a lot of people are affected by this problem, it's terribly embarrassing for sufferers, especially now it's swimsuit season. Blemishes can be caused by anything from hormones to tight underwear causing friction and trapping sweat against the skin, but a bit of TLC can work wonders.'

Beauty expert: Clare Russell helps Kim achieve the perfect derriere

While I have no intention of posting a 'belfie' any time soon, I am only too aware that my own middle-aged bottom is somewhat neglected - and with a beach holiday looming, a bacial seems prudent.

The bacial at EF Medispa is bespoke to each client - when it comes to bottoms, one size apparently doesn't fit all.

So my treatment begins with an assessment. I strip off my jeans and climb onto the massage table. Unsure of the dress code, I opt for bikini bottoms.

But before I have a chance to think about it further, my therapist, Clare Russell, has pulled them aside to inspect the damage. (Learn from my mistake - it's easier for the therapist if you bite the bullet and go commando, or slip into one of the salon's paper thongs.)

Having endured the embarrassment of my 55-year-old buttocks being scrutinised under an unforgiving light, I perk up when Clare informs me that I am fortunate enough to be free of blemishes.

But, she tells me gravely, years of neglect have left my bottom looking rather lacklustre. Some maintenance, she tells me, is most definitely in order.

Fruity: Clare applies a blueberry smoothie - not a drink but a chemical peel aimed at removing dead skin cells

What were once dimples are now plain cellulite and things aren't as firm as they used to be. Plus, as I haven't exfoliated in some time, things are more prickly pear than peach.

Clare prescribes a 'blueberry smoothie' which isn't a drink but a chemical peel aimed at removing dead skin cells. This is to be followed by LED light therapy - a non-invasive treatment using a high-grade cold laser to heal problematic skin.  

But first, my buttocks are massaged with tea tree cleansing cream. While having a stranger pummel your bottom is peculiar, I nevertheless feel my gluteus maximus begin to relax.

Next is another cleanse, using a toner that aims to increase skin cell turnover, and then it's time for the smoothie, a mask containing blueberry extracts, blue corn meal and lactic acids.

Ever since a Sex And The City episode where Samantha's face is left red raw after such a treatment, the term 'chemical peel' has struck fear in my heart. Now it is striking fear into my nether regions.

But Clare reassures me that, although I might feel a light tingle or warmth on application, this is a very gentle peel that will restore a glow without visible irritation.

She presses the mask on and leaves me to relax for 15 minutes while the mask weaves its magic. I can't help wondering what on Earth my husband would make of all this if he could see me, wearing nothing but a mask across my  bottom. (I removed my bikini following the initial embarrassment).

Women are keen to emulate the bottoms of stars like Kelly Brook, right, and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini

After a quarter of an hour has passed, warm, damp flannels are used to wipe off the mask, leaving my buttocks invigorated. Then it's time for the sciencey bit, with a little LED light therapy - which uses a combination of coloured lights to promote healing, correct pigmentation, help with any scar tissue and encourage circulation.

Clare wheels over an arch-shaped lighting panel, which she places about 18 inches above my bottom before switching it on. I don’t feel anything, not even warmth, but my bottom is lit up like a rainbow.  

The blue light is an anti-bacterial spot blaster, which has the added benefit of preparing the skin for sun exposure by increasing its natural UV protection, making it a perfect pre-holiday treatment.  

The yellow light boosts the nervous, lymphatic and circulatory systems and helps detoxify skin tissue. In combination with the red light, it stimulates collagen production, which results in firmer skin.

Clare says three to five treatments are recommended to obtain the best results.

While the LED panel does its work, I dream of my new and improved bottom jauntily making its way along a Majorcan beach.  After 15 minutes, the LED is wheeled away and Clare massages a divine-smelling shea butter moisturiser into the whole area, gently putting one hand on top of the other and tapping to create a vibrating sensation, which apparently aids lymphatic drainage.

The process ends with a warning to keep my buttocks hydrated for the next four or five days - not a sentence you hear very often - using a rich body lotion.

Finally, I sit up and, even without looking, I feel optimistic about the state of my derriere. Just knowing it’s had such state-of-the-art treatment makes me feel more confident. And frankly, so it should, because if there’s one thing that might give me pause for thought, it’s the price.

At £180 for the Blueberry Smoothie plus a further £150 for the LED Light Therapy, I'm quite literally sitting on a fortune.

But it's worth it. After just one session, I'm delighted, as is my husband, who comments on how smooth it feels. My bum feels firmer, the skin looks plump, its tone better, and my formerly dehydrated cheeks feel... dare I say it, soft as a baby's bottom.

If you can't quite stretch to a £300-plus bacial, try DIY. Anything you'd use on your face can also be used on your bum. Start with a cleanser - Garnier Skin Naturals PureActive Deep Pore Wash (£3.49, superdrug.com) contains spotbusting salicyclic acid, as well as blueberry to reduce the appearance of marks.

If you want to use a toner, Clarins' Gentle Exfoliator Brightening Toner (£25, clarins.co.uk) encourages cell renewal and prevents the build-up of dead skin cells.

As for exfoliating, a body brush can scratch, so try a gentle fruit acid mask such as REN Glycolactic Radiance Renewal Mask (£30, renskincare.com).

Leave for ten minutes and then remove with a warm, wet flannel. Moisturise with Olay Regenerist Night Renewal Elixir (£19.99, boots.com), which will also boost cell turnover.
