Mums, mates and make-up: when a girl's feeling low, this triple-whammy of female gorgeousness is guaranteed to lift the spirits.

For those who have been watching MIC recently, you'll know I've been through a rough patch, romantically - suffice to say, I'm grateful for the invention of waterproof mascara, as I've shed an ocean of tears in the last few weeks.

Mummy Felstead to the rescue! 'We're going to get you through this,' she announced. Before I knew what was happening, she'd got on the phone to my friend, the singer Stacey Jackson, who just happened to be shooting the video for her new single Dance The Night Away.

Together my mum and my mate arranged for me to be chauffeured to the video set and glamorously made up, so I could appear in the video.Â 

The song is a funky house number and the vid is set in a nightclub - so it called for a sultry nighttime face. I was so pleased with my look, created by brilliant make-up artist Buster Knight, that I thought I'd share it with you.

STEP 1: The Face

Forget 'no make-up make-up', this is a full-on high-glamour look, which demands a flawless complexion.

Buster began by prepping my skin using Clarins Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch Primer. Next he applied DiorSkin Forever Foundation all over my face, before dotting a touch of Clarins Instant Light Brush-On Perfector on top, to highlight the skin, add definition and camouflage any imperfections.

Binky says that by no means is this a natural look and looks best with heavy contouring and dramatic eyes

He fixed this base in place with a dusting of Vichy Dermablend Powder, lightly applied with a big, soft brush.

Finally, he contoured and highlighted my face using Daniel Sandler Sculpt and Slim Contour Kit. Last but not least, a swoosh of Guerlain Terracotta Bronzer across my cheeks and forehead gave my skin the warm, sexy glow that I love.

STEP 2: The Eyes

Just as with the complexion, prepping the eye area is all-important when creating a dramatic, smoky effect like this one.

Buster began by blending bareMinerals Prime Time Brightening Eye Primer across my lids. This creates a smooth base on which to apply colour, and gives your make-up added staying power, ensuring you look just as fabulous leaving the club as you did on arrival.

Next, Buster buffed Daniel Sandler Sheer Satin Shadow in Gilded Taupe all over the lid and through the socket, forming a nude base. Then he ran DiorShow Fusion Mono Shadow in Nocturne along the lashes, winging it out at the corners.

Using Clarins Crayon Kohl Eye Pencil in black, he intensified my lash line, before applying false eyelashes to create an ultra-glam wink, and finishing up with Too Faced Lash Injection Mascara.

Finally, Buster touched up my brows using Too Faced Brow-Nie Brow Pencil, to create a strong frame for my dramatic eyes.

Binky's glamorous lips were created using a nude palette and finished with a high shine gloss and bronzer across her cheeks and forehead gave her a warm, sexy glow

STEP 3: The Lips

This look is all about the intense eyes, so Buster kept my lips luscious but neutral, framing and filling in my lips with Guerlain Lip Liner in Rose de Bulgarie.

Next he applied Dior Rouge Couture Colour Lipstick in Ambre Zemire, followed by a sexy slick of Clarins Gloss Prodige in Papaya for the final glamorous touch.

When Buster had finishing working on my face, I felt newly gorgeous and ready to party. Stacey and I went straight from dancing in the video shoot to dancing all night in a club, with our sultry faces still in place. It was the perfect girly pick-me-up!

As all you girls know, you can't beat a bit of retail therapy when you're feeling glum, so I treated myself to some gorgeous new bits from my fave lingerie brand Bluebella.

I picked up the Skylar bra and briefs; the pale hue is perfect for spring and I love the girly ruffle detailing. It's a playful, whimsical set with a touch of naughtiness in the form of the sheer fabric - j'adore!

The tears are drying and Binky's back!
