Recently indicted Congressman Michael Grimm, best known for threatening to throw a reporter 'off a f*****g balcony', attended a sweet 16 party last weekend and set off a frenzy amongst the teen girls present as he posed for pictures.

The Republican representative from New York made the special visit to a constituents birthday and his arrival caused the girls to swoon over the former Marine and one to declare him her 'bae' - slang for 'before anyone else.'

The unexpected teenage freak out over the infamous Capitol Hill tough-guy sparked some fevered Twitter posts, with the same girl exclaiming, 'f*****g' Michael Grimm is going' and  that she was 'gonna dance with him all night and make him fall in love with me.'

Before anyone Else: This is one of the tweets discovered by Business Insider of Congressman Michael Grimm's attendance at a sweet 16 birthday party over the weekend. Grimm is a friend of the girl's family and was attending for them. Her identity has been obscured in this, one of the tweets she sent

Somewhat inappropriately for the combative 44-year-old, Business Insider is reporting that Grimm told the teen that this would not be their last encounter.

'He told me he's taking me to prom I was like you fricking better,' the teen added to Twitter.

Indeed, Business Insider reported that another teenage girl at the party began tweeting exited conversations she heard about Grimm between her and her friends.

'Michael Grimm is coming.' 'Oh sh** now I have to wear nice underwear,' she wrote.

The tweets have since been removed from the Internet and it is not known where the party was held.

Awkward: Michael Grimm's heartthrob status on Capitol Hill may be known to insiders, but it seems that teenage girls feel the same way about he controversial politician

Party hopes: The girl took to social media to tell her followers that she will be doing her best to make the ex-marine turned Republican politician fall in love with her

When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Grimm explained the congressman is a 'personal friend' of the birthday girl's family and did not just gatecrash the party.

The congressman, who was briefly married in 2004, but is now single, has been labeled one of the sexiest bachelors in Congress in the past.

His all-action-hero past, in which he served in the First Gulf War and for a time as a special agent with the FBI, has marked him out as an eligible bachelor on Capitol Hill.

However, it seems that Grimm is never far from controversy.

In September, 2013, Grimm was subject of allegations from the Brooklyn Magazine that he had acted inappropriately in public for a member of Congress.

The magazine claimed that witnesses had seen him going inside a restroom with a woman for 15 minutes while at bar in the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn.

The congressman, who represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, apparently spent such a 'long f*****g time' in the bar's bathroom that 'people were talking about it'.

Grimm's colorful past crops up again in a 2011 New Yorker article written by Evan Ratliff about undercover FBI operations in the city.

Allegedly in July, 1999, Grimm was apparently conducting an affair with a married woman while he was working with the FBI.

Apparently, one night in 1999, Grimm and the lady he was dating entered the Caribbean Tropics nightclub in Queens and bumped into her estranged husband.

Gordon Williams, was an off-duty NYPD officer working as a bouncer at the club at the time and he broke up what turned into an altercation between the two men.

However, he told the New Yorker that around 2.30am, Grimm returned for a standoff in the parking lot and was waving a gun around screaming he was going to kill the husband and saying, 'I'm a f*****g FBI agent, ain't nobody going to threaten me.'

However, Grimm is most famous for allegations of fraud and for threatening the life of a reporter who asked him questions he did not like.

In April, Grimm was charged with 20 criminal counts addressing different fraud allegations after turning himself in to FBI headquarters in Manhattan.

The Republican representative from Staten Island entered a not guilty plea to a U.S. Magistrate in connection to all 20 counts which include several fraud charges relating to a health food store that he ran before running for Congress.

He is charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and tax fraud, all of which are connected to his involvement in an Upper East Side restaurant where he was an investor before launching into his political career in 2010.

The bulk of the alleged crimes themselves took place before he was a Congressman, and he is accused of concealing more than $1million in receipts, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars that were kept away from employees.

Grimm, 44, is familiar with the FBI headquarters as he worked for the agency for more than a decade before leaving in 2006.

'As a former F.B.I. agent, Representative Grimm should understand the motto: fidelity, bravery and integrity,'  F.B.I. assistant director George Venizelos said in a statement.

'Yet he broke our credo at nearly every turn. In this 20-count indictment, Representative Grimm lived by a new motto: fraud, perjury and obstruction.'

And in January, Grimm stormed off during a live television broadcast when NY1 reporter Michael Scotto tried to ask him about a controversy over his campaign finances - but Grimm returned to confront the TV news man.

Conducting their interview around the balcony of the Capitol, Grimm squared up to Scotto and told him 'you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony' before threatening to break Scotto in half 'like a boy'.

The incident was caught on camera, showing how Grimm cut the interview short after refusing to answer questions about the probe.

Although the audio in the clip that captured the exchange is very low, a transcript provided by NY1 shows that at one point Grimm said to Scott: 'Let me be clear to you, you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony.’

The reporter attempted to defend himself, pointing out that he simply wanted to ask ‘a valid question.’

In response, Grimm told him: 'No, no, you're not man enough, you're not man enough. I'll break you in half. Like a boy.’

In the wake of the incident, Grimm released an unapologetic statement claiming that he was ‘extremely annoyed’ because he was doing NY1 a favor by agreeing to do their interview first.

‘The reporter knew that I was in a hurry and was only there to comment on the State of the Union, but insisted on taking a disrespectful and cheap shot at the end of the interview, because I did not have time to speak off-topic,’ Grimm said.
