George Osborne will announce an extra £1billion in NHS funding next week to avert a potential winter crisis, government sources say.

The Chancellor is expected to use his Autumn Statement to pledge the extra money, as hospital admissions soar.

Lib Dem Health Minister Norman Lamb has suggested extra health funding for England must be found before the general election to prevent a ‘crash’ in services.

Several A&E departments have already warned they are at crisis point as the number of patients attending has risen, with many visiting because they cannot get an appointment with their GP.

Attendances are on average 5 per cent higher compared with this time last year.

Last week also saw 108,301 patients admitted for emergency treatment in England – the highest figure ever recorded.

Units in Scunthorpe, Middlesbrough, Wigan, the Wirral and King’s Lynn in Norfolk have had to advise patients in recent weeks not to attend hospital with minor complaints.

And senior doctors have warned that if there is a particularly cold winter the NHS could fail to cope.

Dr Chris Moulton, vice president of the College of Emergency Medicine, has expressed particular concern about the length of time patients are having to wait to be seen by a doctor.

Earlier this week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted he had taken his own children to A&E because he feared it would take too long to get an appointment with a GP.

There are also fears some patients are being discharged from hospital too soon in an effort to free up beds, leading to return visits.

At the same time, ‘bed-blocking’ is becoming an increasing problem.

Figures released by NHS England yesterday said that in October, 96,564 ‘bed days’ were wasted on patients who should have been discharged – a rise of around 20 per cent on a year ago.

Overdue assessments, long waits for social care plans and funding disputes were behind some of the delays.

Richard Murray, director of policy at health think-tank the King’s Fund, said: ‘If you look at where A&E performance in November was back in 2009 and 2010, we are probably already in a winter crisis.

‘Performance against the four-hour [A&E waiting time] target has already dipped well below where you’d expect it to be, with some hospitals failing to meet it and some missing the target by a long way.’

Labour announced an extra £2.5billion a year in NHS funding at its party conference, to be paid for through a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and a crackdown on tax avoidance.

But it later emerged that the money would not start trickling into NHS coffers until the middle of the next Parliament.

Conservative and Lib Dem MPs have accused Labour of ‘hypocritical posturing’ over the health service.

One Tory source said Labour appeared to be cynically ‘hoping for’ a winter crisis, thinking it could help the party’s chances at next year’s general election.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said it had already committed an extra £700million for thousands more doctors, nurses and beds this winter.
