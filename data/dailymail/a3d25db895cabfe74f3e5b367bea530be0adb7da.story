A 72-year-old man was killed today after going back into a burning home to retrieve his cell phone.

Rex Benson died in the early hours this morning in the blaze at a single story home in Plano, Texas.

The elderly father along with his daughter and his roommate, had made it out safely after the home caught fire around 1am - but realizing they had no phone to call 911, both men rushed back inside.

Fire crews arrived minutes later after receiving 911 calls from neighbors and found the home engulfed in flames.

Mr Benson's body was found by rescuers inside the building. No other injuries were reported and the identities of the others involved were not yet available. 

Captain Peggy Harrell told CBS: 'The tragedy here is that the three adults living in the home actually made it out of the home, realized that they had no way to call 911 -  no phone with them.

'So two of the residents - two males - actually re-entered the burning home.'

The fire captain warned against anyone running back into a burning building as it was impossible to predict the direction of flames or when a structure may collapse.

Neighbors said that the man had lived at the home for two decades. Friend Nakita Weseman told CBS: 'He could’ve come to any of the neighbors’ houses to call 911. I know he realized, probably, he didn’t have his cell phone, but that’s definitely replaceable. He wasn’t.'

The cause of the fire is being investigated.
