Fight: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan will not 'cave in' to Brussels, aides say

Iain Duncan Smith accused the European Commission of a ‘blatant’ power-grab yesterday as unelected Brussels bureaucrats took Britain to court over benefits for immigrants.

The Work and Pensions Secretary vowed to fight ‘every step of the way’ to retain rules that force EU migrants to pass a ‘right to residency’ test before they can claim a host of benefits.

But, in an embarrassing twist for the Government, the Mail can reveal that the pressure group which made the original legal complaint has actually been funded by the Foreign Office.

Around £500,000 of taxpayers’ money was paid over five years to Advice on Individual Rights in Europe, which has brought test cases demanding the right for EU immigrants not to have to undergo a residency test.

Ministers were accused of having ‘lost the plot’ for funding the very people who want them prosecuted for discrimination.

If Brussels bosses get their way, officials estimate, it will cost taxpayers up to £155million a year in extra benefits for EU immigrants already in the UK and may encourage thousands more to move to the UK, pushing costs up higher still.

Ministers have previously claimed that a total of £2billion a year is paid out in benefits to foreign nationals.

The Commission referred the UK to the EU’s Court of Justice over the right-to-reside test imposed on nationals from member states since 2004.

Ministers have previously claimed that a total of £2billion a year is paid out in benefits to foreign nationals.

In a statement it said: ‘The UK discriminates unfairly against nationals from other member states. This contravenes EU rules.’

The Spanish government is being sued by the European Commission over the refusal of some hospitals to recognise the European Health Insurance Card.

The card allows EU citizens to access free healthcare in public hospitals across the continent.

But patients in some Spanish hospitals have had the card refused and told to reclaim treatment costs from their travel insurance, the Commission claims.

The Spanish health ministry said the EHIC 'has worked properly in Spain for years'.

A spokesman told the BBC there was '"no proof' that some British citizens had been pressured, or even tricked, into paying via their private travel insurance.

The Commission said some EU migrants 
are missing out on payments including child benefit, child tax credit, 
and jobseekers allowance.

But Mr Duncan Smith accused the 
Commission of a ‘blatant land-grab’ against national governments by 
using the court case to seize control of welfare payments – a sphere 
that is the preserve of national governments.

He said: ‘People in this country 
expect me to protect the benefits system from abuse and protect the 
money of hardworking taxpayers.

‘I will not cave in and I will 
continue to work on strengthening our benefit system in the meantime to 
ensure it is not open to abuse by anyone.’

He added: ‘What is going on at the 
moment is that the Commission is trying to use freedom of movement as a 
way in to start controlling what national governments do about those who
 are not in work in their countries.’

But ministers faced criticism after 
it emerged that they have been funnelling cash to the group that has 
persuaded the Commission to take the Government to court.

Europe Minister David Lidington has 
confirmed that the Foreign Office gave £455,500 to Advice on Individual 
Rights in Europe between 2006 and 2011.

The decision to take Britain to court
 sparked fury yesterday. Tory MP Sarah Wollaston said: ‘Eurocracy has 
lost touch with reality. We cannot and must not pay benefits to all EU 
citizens who set foot in the UK.’

The Open Europe think tank accused 
the Commission of a ‘gigantic own goal’. Research director Stephen Booth
 said: ‘The European Commission has thrown a hand grenade into an 
already intense debate about the UK’s continued EU membership.’

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The 
very fact that the Commission has the audacity to haul the UK Government
 in front of the European Courts of Justice for a very long and 
expensive trial is clear evidence that in a Britain versus European 
Union fight, we just don’t win.’

Embarrassing: It has emerged that The Advice on Individual Rights in Europe Centre, which made the original legal complaint about the UK's rules, was given £500,000 funding by the Foreign Office
