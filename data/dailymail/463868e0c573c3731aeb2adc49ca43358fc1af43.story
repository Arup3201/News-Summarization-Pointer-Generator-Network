A grandfather given 18 months to live after he was diagnosed with leukaemia has had his life saved by two umbilical cords.

David Pyne, 60, underwent a remarkable stem cell transplant using the babies’ cords after all other treatments were exhausted.

Patients with cancers such as leukaemia need blood stem cells to replace their own damaged cells and cells taken from babies' donated cords can now be used for bone marrow transplants.

Hope: David Pyne (with wife Susan),  underwent a stem cell transplant for his leukeamia using blood from umbilical cords after all other treatments were exhausted

The
 cords are rich in stem cells, which can grow into healthy blood. And 
because newborns have not been exposed to infections, their stem cells 
are less likely to attack the immune system.

Mr Pyne said: 'I was truly amazed when my doctor at The Christie Hospital in Manchester said we could use this option.

'To think that two newborns saved an old man’s life is just marvellous and it’s given me more time with my own grandchildren.'

The father-of-four and grandfather-of-seven, from Baguley, Wythenshawe, was diagnosed with leukaemia following routine blood tests in August 2012.

He began chemotherapy and blood transfusions and in 2012, a search for a stem cell donor was launched.

But no members of his family proved a match and no other donors could be found - leaving him with a life expectancy of around 12 to 18 months.

Cord blood is taken from a baby's umbilical cord soon after birth.

A machine is used to spin the blood and separate off the stem cells.

These are then frozen until needed (the rest of the blood is discarded).

Once a match has been found, the patient has chemotherapy, and 
sometimes radiotherapy, to destroy their cancerous white blood cells.

During the transplant, relatively few stem cells are used - around 100ml - which are given like a blood transfusion.

Once in the bloodstream, the cells find their way to the bone marrow and start producing healthy blood cells.

Patients spend several weeks in hospital while their immune system recovers.

Then last September, he underwent the 
transplant using stem cells from the umbilical cords of a baby born in 
America and one born in France.

The childrens' parents
 had already agreed to allow the stems cells to be harvested and banked 
with a view to helping save another person’s life.

The two donor babies were found to be a good match and their cells were flown to The Christie Hospital.

The technique is available on the NHS and the hospital has carried out six similar transplants in the past year.

Mr
 Pyne said: 'Things were looking pretty grim until I got the news about 
the possibility of an umbilical cord stem cell transplant.

'The team from The Christie found two separate umbilical cord donors that were a good match. I just felt elated. 

'It was something to hope for - like a lifeline was being thrown to you. I grabbed it with both hands and hoped for the best.'

During the procedure, Mr Pyne spent six 
weeks in hospital. Stem cells from the second cord began to work and his
 condition slowly began to improve.

Dr Mike Dennis, director of the 
haematology and transplant unit at The Christie, said: 'Umbilical cord 
blood is very rich in stem cells, which being so immature has phenomenal
 regenerative powers

'These 
were a great, alternative source of cells for David - in fact the only 
option - as after a worldwide search he had no other available donor.'

Relief: Mr Pyne said: 'To think that two newborns saved an old man's life is just marvellous and it's given me more time with my own grandchildren'

The first line of treatment in cancer of the blood is chemotherapy, but
 if that fails then doctors consider a bone marrow transplant.

Around 
1,100 patients in Britain have these transplants every year - mainly for
 leukaemia but also for disorders such as sickle cell anaemia.

A 
good match is important if the patient's body is not to reject the 
healthy donor bone marrow.

Dr Mike Dennis, director of the haematology and transplant unit at The Christie, said the cord blood was Mr Pyne's last option

Thirty per cent of patients find a match 
among their relatives; another 50 per cent are successfully matched with
 donors from bone marrow registers.

In recent years, it has been discovered that blood taken from babies’ umbilical cords and placentas is rich in life-saving stem cells that can be used for transplants.

But around 65,000 litres of cord blood are still discarded following births in Britain.

It is estimated that around 400 patients miss out on vital treatment because of a lack of suitable stem cell donors.

If 50,000 units of cord blood were saved, 80 per cent of transplant requests in Britain could be met.

An increasing number of pregnant women here are being asked if they want to donate their baby’s umbilical cord and placenta. The blood is also collected in countries including the US, Germany, France and Spain.

It is totally risk-free and does not interfere with the baby’s delivery.

The blood is collected from the umbilical cord by a specialist nurse shortly after a baby has been born.

The Anthony Nolan Trust, Britain’s blood cancer charity and bone marrow register, hosts a collection centre in Nottingham where cord blood is stored.

It collects cord blood at hospitals in London, Birmingham and Leicester and aims to collect 15,000 cord blood units by the end of this year.

Cord blood can also be donated through the NHS at six hospitals in London.

The NHS has its own cord blood bank in Bristol, which contains more than 20,000 units.
