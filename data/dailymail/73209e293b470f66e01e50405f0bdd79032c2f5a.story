A woman has been seriously injured after two diggers fell off the back of a lorry on a dual carriageway, smashing into a car.

The lorry was carrying the the two vehicles down the A194 in South Tyneside this morning.

It is thought that the diggers clipped a railway bridge as they passed underneath, knocking them off of the lorry and on to the road.

Crash scene: One of the two diggers was seen lying across the A194 this morning after it fell off the back of a lorry

Clipped: The diggers are thought to have fallen from the lorry after clipping the railway bridge seen in the background

Casualty: A woman was taken to hospital after her car was hit by a digger

Police, paramedics and the fire service were dispatched to the scene at around 11am today.

The woman was taken to hospital in an ambulance while police officers set about investigating the scene.

One of the diggers could be seen resting upside-down on the carriageway with its arm extended.

Injury: One of the diggers hit a car, which can be seen in the background, leaving one woman with serious injuries

Damage: Bricks are missing from a pillar past which the lorry would have travelled

Response: Investigators, who closed the road for a time, can be seen inspecting the fallen vehicles

The damaged car could be seen feet away from the upturned digger, where it had come to a stop the other side of a crash barrier, having lost its roof.

In the wake of the accident the road was closed in both directions, though one lane has now re-opened.

A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: 'One woman appears to be seriously injured and has been taken to hospital. Traffic is slow-moving at this time.'
