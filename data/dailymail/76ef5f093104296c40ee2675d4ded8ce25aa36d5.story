Cllr Peter Lagoda remains a Cambridgeshire County Councillor despite being given a community sentence for a £25,000 benefit fraud

A former Ukip county councillor and his wife have escaped jail despite swindling nearly £25,000 in a two-year benefit fraud.

Cllr Peter Lagoda and wife Maria, both 59, initially denied the charges against them but changed their plea at the start of their trial last month.

The pair admitted giving Fenland District Council a false address in a bid to cash in on extra benefits.

Lagoda had claimed he lived in a house in South Beach, Cambridgeshire, when in fact he shared a property in Wisbech with his then-girlfriend, now wife.

Peterborough Crown Court had heard the dishonesty stretched for more than two years between June 2008 and November 2010.

The false representation allowed the couple to falsely claim around £11,565 in income support, £2,346 in council tax and £10,949 in housing benefit.

Returning to court for a sentencing hearing today, Lagoda and his wife were told they would not face a custodial sentence.

Instead, they were each handed a 12-month community order by Judge Sean Enright.

Lagoda was elected to represent Wisbech South on Cambridgeshire County Council in May last year.

But he was suspended from UKIP after being charged by Cambridgeshire police in connection with the fraud.

County Council leader Cllr Martin Curtis said the disgraced representative should now do the right thing and resign.

Cllr Lagoda and his wife Maria pocketed £25,000 in extra benefits after failing to tell authorities they were living together

He told MailOnline: 'He stood for election knowing this was hanging over him so from my perspective he deceived the electorate.

'In my view, many of them would not have voted for him they knew this was hanging over him.

'It is quite clear that this is a man that does not have the qualities to be a councillor and should not be one.

'This was not a mistake or misunderstanding, he admitted making a representation he knew to be false.

'It sets a poor example and damages the reputation of councillors as a whole.'

Council protocol means Lagoda's sentence is not serious enough to debar him from staying on.

A council spokesman said today: 'Cllr Lagoda’s status as a councillor remains unchanged. As such it would be wrong for the authority to comment any further.'

Lagoda's suspension from Ukip came after he admitted having described one of his north African relatives as a 'w*g' and German relatives as 'Mongols' whose children have 'slanty eyes'.

On a visit to a fire station, he said: 'Yes, my cousin married Mongols and now all their little children are ever so cute and they have slanty eyes.'

He later described the reaction to his comments as 'ridiculously over the top' and insisted his words had been taken out of context.

When contacted after today's hearing, Lagoda refused to comment.
