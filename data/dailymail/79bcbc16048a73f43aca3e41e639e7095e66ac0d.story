After years of walking around in slippery, ill-fitting shoes, the tallest man in the
United States has finally received his custom-made sneakers.

Igor Vovkovinskiy, stands just over 7 feet, 8 inches tall and struggles to find shoes for his size 24, 10E feet.

But this week the 30-year-old from Minnesota was delighted to receive three pairs of specially-made shoes from Reebok.

As he tried on a pair, he said it felt as if he were 'walking on pillows or mattresses.'

Exciting arrival: Igor Vovkovinskiy the tallest person living in America, speaks with a reporter about his new custom made size 24 Reebok shoes

He says he's had 16 foot surgeries in six years because of damage caused by ill-fitting shoes.

Mr Vovkovinskiy said before the new shoes arrived, his only shoes had no traction, making it 'suicidal' to leave his home.

'I
haven't been able to go for a joyful walk for six years now,' said Vovkovinskiy

Igor Vovkovinskiy, currently the tallest man in the United States at seven feet eight inches, has an imprint taken of his foot by technicians as part of a shoe fitting at Reebok headquarters, in Canton Masschusetts

'I look forward to just going for a walk with my dog, just walking 
around the neighborhood.'

Mr Vovkovinskiy traveled to 
Reebok headquarters in Canton in May for a complex shoe-fitting 
that involved, among other things, custom pressure-mounting equipment, 
bio-foam, a device that takes precise measurements of length, a tape 
measure and a handful of technicians.

Reebok built the shoes at a cost to them of $12,000 to $20,000.

It has 
helped Mr Vovkovinskiy before said the company said, who are helping him free of charge.

Vovkovinskiy, who has a shoe size between 22 and 26 has had 16 surgeries in six years to fix problems created by shoes that didn't fit. Reebok is providing the shoes at no charge

The
size of Mr Vovkovinskiy's shoes depends on measurements such as the 
length, width and distance from his soles to the top of his feet.

Those 
measurements are particularly tricky with Mr Vovkovinskiy because he has 
unusually shaped toes and feet because of his numerous surgeries.

It took the company six weeks to create prototypes for 
Mr Vovkovinskiy to try out.

And then once they were adjusted they were created into 
proper-fitting shoes.

Originally from the Ukraine, Mr Vovkovinskiy moved at age seven with his mother to 
Minnesota for treatment of his condition, known as pituitary gigantism.

When he moved he was 6-ft tall at the time.

Mr Vovkovinskiy 
said his life changed when the series of surgeries started.

That forced 
him to spend three years on bed rest, during which time his muscles 
weakened and he gained weight.

'Living the last six years has been a nightmare basically,' said Mr Voykrovinskiy.

Shoes that fit will get him outside and make a huge difference he explained.

'Basically,
I'm a prisoner of my own house, even though I am medically cleared to 
walk,' said Vovkovinskiy.

'Where am I going to go with shoes that are 
painful?'
