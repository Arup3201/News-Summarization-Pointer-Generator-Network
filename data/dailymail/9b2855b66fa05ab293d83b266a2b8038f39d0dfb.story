Controversy: the comments made by Mr Davies have been condemned as 'preposterous and embarrassing'

The disabled should be allowed to work for less than the minimum wage to help them get jobs, a Tory MP has suggested.

Philip Davies said that if people with disabilities or mental health problems could be paid   less than £5.93 an hour it would help them to compete better with the able-bodied in the employment market.

His remarks prompted uproar, with Labour MP Dame Anne Begg, the wheelchair-bound chairman of the Commons work and pensions committee, branding them ‘outrageous and unacceptable’.

Mental health charity Mind said they were ‘preposterous’.

In a Commons debate on employment law, Mr Davies said: ‘The people who are most disadvantaged by the national minimum wage are the most vulnerable in society.’

London mayor Boris Johnson apologised yesterday after calling a Labour rival a ‘care in the community’ patient.

When complaining that he was being 
barracked in the London Assembly by John Biggs, Mr Johnson had said he 
was the victim of ‘incoming [fire] from care in the community’.

He told MPs he spoke to people with health problems who thought it ‘inevitable’ that someone without such difficulties would be taken on instead. He suggested they should be able to offer to work for less.

His remarks were immediately challenged by fellow Right-wing Tory Edward Leigh, who demanded: ‘Why actually should a disabled person work for less than £5.93 an hour? It’s not a lot of money, is it?’

Mr Davies, MP for the Yorkshire constituency of Shipley, insisted: ‘If an employer is looking at two  candidates, one who has got disabilities and one who hasn’t, and they have got to pay them both the same rate, I invite you to guess which one the employer is more likely to take on.’

'Discrimination': Campaigners say half working age people are still unable to access employment in this country

The
 Equality Act, which replaced the Disability Discrimination Act last 
October, aims to ensure employers do not discriminate against disabled 
people.
  
  It provides legal rights for disabled 
people in employment, education, access to goods and services, buying 
and renting land and property, and functions of public bodies.
  
  But despite this, campaigners say half working age disabled people remain unable to access employment.
  
  Disabled charities also say disabled people in work earn less than their colleagues.

Dame Anne said: ‘To suggest disabled people should be treated as second-class citizens is shocking and shows just what a warped world some Tories demonstrate they inhabit.’

Mind spokesman Sophie Corlett said: ‘People with mental health problems should not be considered a source of cheap labour.’

Mr Davies rejected the criticisms. He said: ‘Left-wing hysteria now dictates you can’t even repeat what people with learning disabilities tell you if it questions their shibboleths.

‘Anne Begg wasn’t even in the debate. She’s obviously drivelled before she knows what it’s about.

‘All I was doing was explaining what people with learning disabilities told me.

‘My whole point was, if those people themselves felt their chances would be encouraged by working below the minimum wage, they should be allowed to.

‘I didn’t and never would say that they should be forced to – it’s just that government shouldn’t stop them from doing so.

‘In no way would I ever say or think that people with disabilities are second class citizens.'

Philip Davies has previously raised concerns after airing a number of outspoken views.

The Conservative MP for Shipley, Yorkshire, wrote a series of letters in 2008 to equality chief Trevor Phillips asking if it offensive to 'black up' if impersonating a black person.

Later the same year Mr Davies claimed the Equality and Human Rights Commission 'pay white staff more than ethnic minorities and men more than women'.

The year before he told a Commons debate that 'most people who vote for the BNP are not racist'.
