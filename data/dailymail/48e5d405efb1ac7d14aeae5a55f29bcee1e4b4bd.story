It's not what you would call a traditional method of saying goodbye to a loved one, but one woman has turned urn designs into something of an art form.

Anne Leigh, 65, has created the containers in a range of shapes, including a flat cap and a boat, in a bid to emulate the personality, likes or hobbies of the person who has passed away.

The artist from Aslacton, Norfolk, started making her unique designs when she created a suitcase for her mother's ashes to represent her love of travelling.

She has since constructed shopping bags and even musical instruments to hold the final remains of beloved individuals.

Unique: Artist Anne Leigh has spoken of how she creates bespoke urns in a bid to illustrate the personality of the departed. Pictured are urns in the shape of a tea set

Heartfelt: Ms Leigh's unique designs started when her mother died and she decided to create an urn in the shape of a suitcase because she loved to travel

Design: One of her more original designs is this flat-cap urn she created

Musical: Ms Leigh has even created urns in the shape of musical instruments, such as this ukulele

Her unique designs started when her mother died and she wanted to make the perfect container for her final journey.

She said: 'The more quirky designs started when my mum died, I wanted to create something that represented her life.

'I made her a suitcase urn because she loved to travel and I added labels for all the places she loved visiting.'

The designs are created from paper, card, paints and adhesives as well as string, cotton and leaves.

Ms Leigh said: 'The main challenge is the materials used, making sure they are all biodegradable is very difficult.

'I love the challenge of making them but also being part of a moment significant to other people'

Challenge: Ms Leigh said the main challenge of making the urns was to make sure they are biodegradable

Bespoke: One of Ms Leigh's more intricate creations was this boat on a globe (left), made for a sailor. Ms Leigh also created this Harrods bag (right) for a self-confessed shopaholic

Intricate: Many of the creations are intricately designed and are all made from biodegradable materials

'The most difficult urn I've ever created was the ukulele urn, which was made of paper and cardboard but was incredibly difficult to shape.'

Ms Leigh also created an urn of a boat on a globe for a sailor.

She said: 'The boat was a model of the actual boat, set on the globe so that when put in the sea, the globe containing the ashes would sink, freeing the boat to take its chances on the ocean.

'It is very challenging because each urn needs to be fool-proof because it is such an important moment and the rituals have to be perfect.'

Among the artist's numerous other creations are a range of teapots and tea cup urns and a Harrods bag urn for a self-confessed shopaholic.

Personal: Ms Leigh said each urn is 'intensely personal to the person it holds'

'Moving': The artist described making each urn 'an incredibly moving process'

One of her more original pieces is a flat-cap urn she created for one woman's grandfather.

Ms Leigh said: 'His granddaughter said he loved his flat cap and he was never without it.

'Each urn is intensely personal to the person it holds and making them is an incredibly moving process.

'An important aspect of the urns I make which is very important to me is their impermanence - they all go into the earth or water.

'Some of the detailing on the suitcase and the ukulele look as though they are metal. However they are made of paper, card & a couple of toothpicks.'
