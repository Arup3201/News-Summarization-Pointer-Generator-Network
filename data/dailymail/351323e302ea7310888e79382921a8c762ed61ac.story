Fresh allegations have emerged that 1973’s infamous ‘battle of the sexes’ tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs was thrown by Riggs to settle an $100,000 gambling debt with the mob.

The event, which took place on Sept 20 1973, was one of biggest media events of its day and King’s impressive victory was widely credited with striking an impressive blow for the women’s liberation movement.

Despite being 55 at the time, retired tennis champ Bobby Riggs was expected to comfortably beat Billie Jean King, then 29 and the world’s No. 2 female player.

Victory for the fairer sex? Did Billie Jean King win the 'battle of the sexes' fair and square or was the match thrown by Bobby Riggs to settle gambling debts

Ego talk: Billie Jean King has dismissed the latest allegations that the infamous tennis match was throw

Four months earlier, Riggs had easily dispatched with the women’s No. 1 Margaret Court.

Instead, Riggs lost 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 to King before a stunned audience of 30,472 fans at the Houston Astrodome. The attendance is still the largest crowd in the U.S. to ever attend a tennis match and millions more watching on TV.

The outcome has repeatedly been dogged by claims it was fixed or the result was thrown, something Riggs repeatedly denied until his death in 1995.

But now almost 40 years after the event, a man has come forward with new allegations that he overheard mob bosses discussing the plot - apparently Riggs' idea - which was set to net them lucrative takings from bookies.

Hal Shaw, left, has told ESPN that he overheard mobsters discussing fixing the 'Battle of the Sexes' tennis match won by Billie Jean King in 1973 

In the early 1970s, Hal Shaw worked as an assistant golf instructor at the Palma Ceia Golf and Country Club in Tampa, Florida.

Now aged 79, Shaw has told ESPN’s ‘Outside the Lines’ that he overheard mob attorney Frank Ragano, Florida mob boss Santo Trafficante Jr. and New Orleans crime boss Carlos Marcello discussing the plan late at night at the club.

'Ragano was emphatic,' Shaw told ESPN. 'Riggs had assured him that the fix would be in - he would beat Margaret Court and then he would go in the tank' against King, but Riggs had promised that he would 'make it appear that it was on the up and up.'

According to Shaw the mobsters said Riggs wanted his gambling debts with them be paid off in return for throwing the game.

'Ragano says, "Well, he's going to [get] peanuts compared to what we're going to make out of this, so he has asked for his debt to be erased,'" Shaw said.

'(He) has also asked for a certain amount of money to be discussed later to be put in a bank account for him in England.'

Shaw said he waited 40 years to come forward with his revelation because he wants to set the record straight

'There are certain things in my life that I have to talk about, have to get off my chest,' Shaw said.

'It's been 40 years, OK, and I've carried this with me for 40 years… The fear is gone… And I wanted to make sure, if possible, I could set the record straight — let the world know that this was not what it seemed to be.'

Larry Riggs, Bobby’s son, told ESPN that his father did know mafia figures and that 'it’s possible' they talked about fixing the match, but said it was more likely his father lost with the intention of setting up a rematch and an even bigger payday. 

Riggs was 77 when he died on Oct. 25, 1995, but just months before his death he said: 'People said I was tanking, but Billie Jean beat me fair and square'

King also remains skeptical that her opponent threw the match. Riggs was an overwhelming pick in Las Vegas and bookies could barely entice any action on King, despite long odds.

'People who were unhappy - guys who lost money,' she told ESPN. 'And a lot of people, men, particularly, don't like it if a woman wins. They don't like it. They make up stories. They start just thinking about it more and more. It's hard on them. It's very hard on their egos.'

Riggs was 77 when he died on Oct. 25, 1995, just months before his death he said: 'People said I was tanking, but Billie Jean beat me fair and square.

'I tried as hard as I could, but I made the classic mistake of overestimating myself and underestimating Billie Jean King.'
