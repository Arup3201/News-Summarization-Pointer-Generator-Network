Rafa Benitez still hopes he can convince Manchester United flop Marouane Fellaini to join Napoli - and says new Reds boss Louis van Gaal has 'nothing to do' with his move for the midfielder.

Former Liverpool and Chelsea manager Benitez was in a bullish mood after his side's 1-0 friendly win over Barcelona and was convinced that Fellaini's decision will hinge on his view of the 'project' in Naples.

The Spaniard's comments seemed to hint that Napoli would wait for the Belgian midfielder to hand in a transfer request at Old Trafford rather than wait for Van Gaal to approve the loan move.

Keen: Rafa Benitez missed out on Javier Mascherano but now hopes to bring in the Manchester United man

Benitez failed in a bid to reunite himself with former Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano this summer and was asked after the friendly win why the Argentine would not be moving from Barcelona.

'It didn’t depend on the Coach, but on the project. That will be the case with Fellaini too: Van Gaal has nothing to do with it,' Benitez said.

The United boss is expected to make a decision soon over which players to cut from his bloated squad ahead of his first season in the Premier League - and £27million flop Fellaini is prime for the chop. 

When asked if the Belgian was close to a move Benitez said to Sport Mediaset: 'Is he? I don't see him.'Our squad is strong, but clearly we are still missing something. We must continue to form a strong group to recover the lost ground from Juventus and Roma.'
