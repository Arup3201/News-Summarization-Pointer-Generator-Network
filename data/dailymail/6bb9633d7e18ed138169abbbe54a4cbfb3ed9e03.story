It was nice work while it lasted.

A software developer making six-figures was fired after his bosses learned he outsourced his work to China so he could spend all day goofing off on the web, it was revealed today.

The lazy but inventive worker, called 'Bob' and identified as being a mid-40s family man in a security report by Verizon, was even praised by his superiors for being 'the best developer in the building.'

Beating the grind: A US-based software developer making six-figures was able to outsource all his work to China. Instead of slaving away at his computer, the man watched cat videos and surfed social media

'His code was clean, well written, and submitted in a timely fashion, the case study said.

'Quarter after quarter, his performance review noted him as the best 
developer in the building.'

The man typically began his 'work' day at a 'critical infrastructure' company with a two-and-a-half-hour marathon session of surfing Reddit and watching cat videos.

Here's how the software developer spent a typical workday:

After that strenuous work, the man, whose name or where he worked was not released, would take a 90-minute lunch break.

Then the man, who was described as 'inoffensive and quiet. Someone you wouldn’t look at twice in an elevator', would then spend about browsing deals on eBay.

After that, the long-tenured employee would check social media by posting Facebook updates and checking people's profiles on LinkedIn.

Once the end of the day came, he sent out an e-mail to management updating them, presumably on the work that others had done in China at his behest.

The report said he was somehow able to pull this scam off at multiple companies, earning several hundred thousands of dollars a year while paying out approximately $50,000 to the Chinese consulting firm.

Beats working: The lazy worker was able to watch hours of cat videos a day, much like this one of two cats leaping around as they swat at a toy

His ruse was uncovered last year when the developer's US-based company noticed that network activity was originating in Shenyang, China.

Fearing a security breach, they contacted Verizon to get to the bottom of it.

The Verizon investigators noticed the suspicious activity was occurring regularly and often spanned the entire eight-hour workday.

Mystery solved: Verizon investigators were the ones who discovered the software developer's tricks

They then spoke with the employee, whose credentials were being used to sustain the network connection in China, and searched his company.

They found invoices for the Chinese firm and searched his web history which confirmed 'the whole story,' the report concluded.
