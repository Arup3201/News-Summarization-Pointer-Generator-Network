Victory: Iain Duncan Smith's Department for Work and Pensions today announced 8,000 people had found work thanks to the benefit cap

One in four of those whose benefits 
were due to be cut as a result of the Government’s cap on state handouts
have now found work.

Figures from the Department of Work 
and Pensions are the first concrete evidence that the crackdown on 
welfare is encouraging people to ditch a life of dependency.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain 
Duncan Smith said they proved his radical reform of the welfare system 
‘is having the desired impact’.

From next Monday the Government will 
impose an annual cap of £26,000 a year – £500 a week – on household 
benefits in four London boroughs, with the scheme going nationwide in 
September.

Single people will see their benefits capped at £350 a week.

Officials originally predicted that 
56,000 would see their benefits cut as a result of the cap, which is 
pegged to the average earnings of those in work.

But when the DWP wrote to those people
warning them that their taxpayer-funded handouts were set to be 
trimmed, 16,000 of them decided to act.

Some 8,000 potentially capped 
claimants have now got jobs through Jobcentre Plus and another 8,000 of 
them have dropped off the welfare rolls.

Officials say the latter group are 
likely to be working in the black economy and have decided to ditch 
benefits rather than face scrutiny of their earnings. While ministers 
are keen to crack down on the cash-in-hand culture, they are encouraged 
that so many will no longer be claiming taxpayers’ money that they  
don’t need.

In total 25,000 of the 56,000 warned they would be hit have accepted help to find a job.

Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘The Benefit Cap
sets a strong incentive for people to move into work and even before 
the cap comes in we are seeing thousands of people seeking help and 
moving off benefits.

Back to work: Jobcentre Plus has contacted those affected by the cap and helped them find employment

‘We have a very clear message: we will
provide support to those who need it, but the days of outrageous claims
giving people incomes far above those of hard-working families are 
over.’

He told the Mail: ‘We have to end the 
crazy situation where people are worse off going to work. We need to 
make going to work the default choice for people, give people an 
incentive.

‘Already we’ve seen 8,000 people who 
would have been affected by the cap move into jobs. This clearly 
demonstrates that the cap is having the desired impact.’

He added: ‘Our Jobcentre Plus advisers
have been working closely for a year with people who will be affected 
by the cap, including offering employment support to help people into 
jobs.

Outrage: The benefit cap is targeted at cases similar to those of Heather Frost, an unemployed mother of 11 who is having a £400,000 house built for her family at taxpayers' expense

‘So far 25,000 people have taken up 
our offers for help. We are engaging people who have never before 
thought going to work was an option for them.’

The Government has exempted people on 
disability benefits from the cap and those on widow’s pensions. Nor will
it apply if someone in the household is in work and claiming Working 
Tax Credits.

The statistics will give the Tories further ammunition in their battle with Labour in the run up to the 2015 general election.

Ed Miliband’s party has opposed every 
welfare cut made by the Coalition, but many in his own ranks are 
concerned that Labour’s soft stance is alienating potential voters.

Mr Duncan Smith told the Mail last 
night: ‘The cap will limit benefit claims to the average salary of a 
working household, at £500 a week. This is a fair amount. Fair to the 
claimant and fair to the taxpayer.

‘Labour voted against the Benefit Cap.
I am not clear whether it is giving people an incentive to work that Ed
Miliband and his colleagues object to – or if Labour are simply opposed
to making sure the welfare system also offers fairness to hard working 
taxpayers? That is a question only Labour can answer.’
