The drug Tamiflu gets flu victims back on their feet faster and reduces complications, claim researchers after the most exhaustive investigation to date.

A major analysis of all published and unpublished trials found it shortens symptoms by a day and cuts the risk of ancillary infections and hospital care.

Controversy has raged over the effectiveness of the drug, with allegations that regulators, researchers and doctors did not have access to vital information from clinical trials.

Controversy: Debate had raged over how effective Tamiflu was - but the new study claims that it cuts hospital admissions for flu by 63% and shortens symptoms of the virus by a day

Last year, a review concluded Tamiflu and Relenza did not reduce admission to hospital or complications from flu such as pneumonia – a key reason for Governments worldwide to stockpile them to reduce the impact of a pandemic.

But new evidence published in The Lancet journal shows Tamiflu is more effective than previously thought.

The research by the University of Michigan, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Alabama found the drug shortens the duration of symptoms by about one day and reduces by 44 per cent respiratory infections that sometimes develop.

Study co-author Dr Arnold Monto, the Thomas Francis Jr. Collegiate Professor of Public Health at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said ‘This is the first patient-level analysis of how well this drug works.

‘Previous research has questioned its success and use in light of the side effects of nausea and vomiting, but the other studies combined those infected with influenza and those without, which diluted the positive effect in treatment.’

Researchers conducted meta-analysis of data from all published and unpublished clinical trials – made available by manufacturer Roche - from 1997-2001. More than 4,300 patients were involved – more than half of whom were treated with Tamiflu.

The drug shortens the duration of symptoms by about one day and reduces respiratory infections that sometimes develop by 44 per cent, researchers found

The drug, also known as oseltamivir, was shown to reduce the duration of the illness by 21 per cent. With the drug, symptom alleviation occurred, on average, at 98 hours compared with 123 hours with placebo.

In addition to reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections requiring antibiotics, like pneumonia (4.9 per cent had complications with the drug compared with 8.7 per cent on placebo), the drug decreased hospital admissions by 63 per cent.

The researchers also found some of the same complications of the drug noted in previous research, with an increase in nausea (3.7 per cent) and vomiting (4.7 per cent).

They did not find more neurological or psychological disorders in those taking the drug.

Professor Peter Openshaw, Director of the Centre for Respiratory Infection at Imperial College London, said: ‘The important thing about this study is that it shows that Roche were not hiding skeletons in its cupboards.

‘As a full review of the published and unpublished data, it leaves the conclusion unaltered that oseltamivir reduces symptom duration by about a day while causing nausea and vomiting in a minority of recipients.

‘Oseltamivir is not a perfect drug but does what you might expect of an antiviral given relatively late in the course of an acute infection and after the illness has already become established.

‘The finding that it reduces hospitalisation by 63 per cent is especially important, reinforcing the call for family practitioners to use antivirals early rather than resorting to antibiotics, which are of no proven benefit in uncomplicated flu.’

Dr John McCauley, Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza, MRC National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), said the use of antiviral medicines can have an important role in reducing the impact of flu.

He added: ‘The authors of the current study concluded that oseltamivir treatment resulted in shorter periods of illness, and moreover, because of the ability to put together the results from many trials, the authors concluded that influenza patients treated with oseltamivir had a reduced risk of being hospitalised or having antibiotics prescribed for lower respiratory tract infection.

‘However, the authors also noted that treatment with oseltamivir induced an increased rate of reporting nausea, and pointed out that the risks and benefits of oseltamivir use still need to be considered carefully.’
