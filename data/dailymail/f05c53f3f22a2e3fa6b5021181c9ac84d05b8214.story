There are few things more humiliating than when a pickpocket makes a monkey out of you . . . it's only worse when that pickpocket's a monkey.

That's what happened to photographer Pete Oxford, from Torquay, Devon, when he visited a market in Puerto Misahualli, in Ecuador's Amazon rainforest.

He said it came right up to him and rifled through his pockets, completely unconcerned by the shoppers - and police - milling around him.

The bold capuchin even sneaked up on a group of children playing football and stole their ball to show off some skills of his own.

Street cap-urchin: Photographer Pete Oxford, from Torquay, Devon, said the plucky monkey's tricks were hilarious to watch - even when it started picking his pockets

Mr Oxford said: 'We were staying in a jungle lodge when we heard about a troop of capuchin monkeys that sometimes run amok in a nearby town.

'Capuchins are South America's most intelligent monkey. Armed with a ferocious set of teeth and a will to bite they can also be quite intimidating.

'The locals have learned the hard way that what the monkeys want, they get.

'On the one hand they are totally endearing and always hilarious to watch, but on the other they are like a band of mischievous thugs.

'This would-be victim cracked up laughing when she spotted the monkey, as there was nothing in her pocket for it to take.

'The fact is, the monkey knows if there's going to be anything to take, it will be in a pocket.'

One monkey also climbed onto a parked car, scrambled all over it and spent a couple of minutes lost in thought gazing at his own reflection.

Mr Oxford said: 'Eventually he got bored and went back to a life of crime.

'From an anthropromorphic point of view I thought the whole thing was hilarious.

'And from a biological viewpoint, it's the zenith of foraging behaviour.

'Capuchins almost never surprise me - you always have to expect the unexpected with them.

'But it is hard not to always be laughing at them. I love my photos as they illustrate to me how clever and underrated these monkeys are.

'My favourite is of the little guy standing on the football. He was showing off with what he could do with a football that the kids couldn't.'
