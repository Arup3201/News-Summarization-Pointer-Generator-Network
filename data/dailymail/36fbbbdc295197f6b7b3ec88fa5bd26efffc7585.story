A 67-year-old man has described the terrifying moment his boat started sinking off the coast of Mexico after a collision with a whale so powerful that the stern of the 22-ton vessel was lifted out of the water.

Max Young returned home to Sacramento on Friday, ten days after the breaching whale slammed onto the bow of his 50-foot boat during a solo voyage.

Mr Young, was on the final leg of a journey from the East Coast to Emeryville, California, when the 55-foot-long whale hit the boat just after dark on June 12.

'The head of that whale would have 
had to have cleared at least 12 feet (from the water) before he came 
down on the boat,' said Mr Young.

'I could 
see its head. It must have been a young whale because he only had a few 
barnacles.'

Mr Young was not hurt in the collision, 
but the steep angle of the boat sent him sliding down the deck toward a 
pile of sea bags.

He said he was only about 10 feet away from the whale 
at the time of impact.

Within a few seconds the whale slid 
back into the water, but not before causing severe damage to the 
sailboat and leaving behind evidence that it had been injured in the 
encounter.

'I saw a piece of rubbery type of material,' he said. 'It was skin from the whale.'

But Mr Young had other things to worry 
about.

Water was gushing in through what he later discovered was a 
massive crack, the boat's steering was damaged and any possible help was
hours away.

Mr Young said he was about 40 miles off 
the western coast of Mexico, or about 400 miles southwest of San Diego.

While the boat's bilge pumps struggled to pump out the ocean water, he 
went to work trying to get the boat back on course.

Young activated an emergency beacon, 
which alerted the U.S. Coast Guard.

With that information, officials at 
the command center were able to direct a merchant ship, which was about 
60 miles away, to the sinking craft.

Mr Young had a life raft on board and a 
larger inflatable boat, but neither was inflating sufficiently to be 
seaworthy.

And the freighter redirected by the Coast Guard, was still a 
few hours away.

'I started making my peace with God,' Mr Young said. 'I thought I was going to die.'

It's when his spirits were lowest, when Mr Young first spotted the rescue ship off in the distance.

'About that time I could see the freighter coming,' he said. 'I knew I was going to be OK.'

The Coast Guard also dispatched a 
HC-130 Hercules aircraft to help guide the rescue ship to the stricken 
boat.

When the plane arrived and circled overhead, the air crew could 
see Young bailing out water.

When the ship arrived, crewmembers 
helped hoist him off his boat.

Young, who has spent most of his life on 
the sea, was unharmed during the ordeal.

'This case is one of those success 
stories,' Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Pamela Boehland said 
earlier this month, just after the rescue.

'A man went out prepared, the
worst happened to him and he was able to respond.'

Young spent six days on board the 
freighter as it steamed to Panama.

He arrived back in Sacramento Friday,
just two days before he and his wife, Debra, were to celebrate their 
23rd anniversary.
