Steven Gerrard will announce on Friday that he is ending his 26-year association with Liverpool at the end of the season.

The Anfield captain, who joined Liverpool when he was eight years old, is wanted by Major League Soccer’s LA Galaxy.

The 34-year-old Kop idol has turned down a contract extension at Liverpool and became free to negotiate with overseas clubs from January 1.

Gerrard has enjoyed a brilliant career at Anfield. The Premier League title has eluded him, but he inspired Liverpool to their incredible Champions League final comeback win against AC Milan in 2005.

Relations between the captain and Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers have improved in recent months, but the midfielder will insist on Friday that his decision to quit is in the best interests of his career.

Rodgers had suggested Gerrard would finish his career as a central defender at Anfield, but his view has changed recently.

Instead, the player was warned he will no longer feature in every game and the club offered him a new package on different terms for 2015-16.

LA Galaxy, who signed David Beckham in 2007, are among a number of clubs interested in signing Gerrard this summer. New York Red Bulls, who employ former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier as their sporting director, are also in the hunt.

Gerrard insists he has made no decision about his next club but has assured Liverpool he will not join a direct rival, as Frank Lampard did when he quit Chelsea for New York City, then joined Manchester City.

The Liverpool legend's availability will alert clubs across Europe, though, and he has a massive decision to make. Monday’s FA Cup third-round tie at AFC Wimbledon is the start of the long goodbye for a player who has made nearly 700 senior appearances for his only club.

Gerrard has lifted 11 trophies but he will always regret missing out on the biggest domestic prize of all. The closest he came to winning the title was last season, when Liverpool finished two points behind champions Manchester City.

Gerrard’s England career ended when they limped out of last summer’s World Cup in Brazil without winning a game, with him as captain.

Shortly after, he announced his international retirement following talks with club boss Rodgers aimed at extending the Kop legend’s career.

After criticism of his form earlier this season, particularly after Liverpool’s 3-1 defeat at West Ham, Gerrard hit back when he scored in the derby against Everton.

He insisted he wasn’t finished but Liverpool’s exit from the Champions League in the group phase hit him hard.

Now he has resolved to quit the club and look for another challenge.
