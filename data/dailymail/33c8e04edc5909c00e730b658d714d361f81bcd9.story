An estate agent called a prospective tenant a ‘f***ing liar’ and a ‘very silly little girl’ after she missed a flat viewing because her car had exploded en route, text messages revealed today.

Ashlie Hamlyn was sent the abusive messages by Clarendon Estates owner Steve Charlton after she missed an appointment when her Volkswagen Polo burst into flames while she was driving.

After the 25-year-old bar worker from Braunstone, Leicestershire, offered this explanation, the estate agent was initially sympathetic - but minutes later he sent a text calling her a ‘f***ing liar’.

Explosion: Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire had been caused by an electrical fault

She said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. I 
was shocked - not only because my car had just burst into flames two 
weeks after I bought it, but that he would be so unprofessional and 
swear at me like that.’

Mr 
Charlton then called her a ‘very silly little girl’ in separate texts after she threatened to take the story to a local newspaper.

Miss Hamlyn had been driving at about 3pm when smoke began billowing 
from the engine, and shortly after a blaze broke out.

She
 said: ‘I could smell smoke and then it started coming through the 
vents. I started to panic and all I could think was “I’ve only had this 
for two weeks”.

‘I stood 
there watching my new car burn. The windows were smashing because of the
 heat and I was panicking because I didn’t want it to blow up.’

A Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service 
spokesman said the fire had been caused by an electrical fault. A family
 took in Miss Hamlyn and gave her a cup of tea while the firefighters 
fought the flames.

Abusive: The estate agent was initially sympathetic - but minutes later he sent a text calling her a 'f***ing liar'

When she got home, she was trying to deal with the aftermath of the fire when she received a call from the estate agent.

'I was at home with my friend, Chris, in tears, on the phone to the insurance company when the message came through. It was the last thing I needed'

She said: ‘I ignored it - I really couldn’t handle it then. Then I got a text saying that I had a viewing and I replied, apologising and explaining what had happened.

‘Then he texted asking if I wanted to view on another day - that was about 5pm. Then at 5.02pm he texted saying he had two other properties I could view, and then at 5.03pm he texted and said I was a “f***ing liar”.

‘I couldn’t believe it. I texted him back
 saying, ‘excuse me?’ ‘And he had the cheek to say I “should have 
cancelled the appointment, I’m meant to be a professional person”.

‘I was at home with my friend, Chris, in 
tears, on the phone to the insurance company when the message came 
through. It was the last thing I needed.’

'Do not contact me again': Mr Charlton then called Miss Hamlyn a 'very silly little girl' in separate texts

Final message: Mr Charlton said that 'one more text or call' from her would see him 'take this further'

Mr Charlton, who runs Clarendon Estates, a small letting agents, confirmed that he sent the expletive message, but claimed he did it because Miss Hamlyn had already reserved another house.

'I did send the message, and for that I have apologised to Ashlie. However, I only said it because I had found out that she had reserved another house in the morning - and that’s why I called her a liar'

Steve Charlton, Clarendon Estates owner

He said: ‘I did send the message, and for that I have apologised to Ashlie. However, I only said it because I had found out that she had reserved another house in the morning - and that’s why I called her a liar.

‘We had confirmed with her earlier in the week that she had a few appointments on the morning of the messages but she never turned up.

‘The car incident happened in the afternoon and I had spent a good hour of my day trying to rearrange other times for her to view the houses.

‘As a result I was really annoyed that she didn’t have the decency to let us know. On top of that I had found out about some personal issues and it all resulted in a stressful afternoon.’

4.28pm - Steve Charlton: ‘You missed a call from me at 16.28, May 21. This is a free Call Alert from O2.'

4.29pm - Ashlie Hamlyn: ‘Who is this?’

4.30pm - Mr Charlton: ‘Steve from Clarendon Estates. We had a viewing booked’

4.43pm - Mr Charlton: ‘????’

4.45pm - Miss Hamlyn: ‘Oh sorry, my car has just gone up in flames. I’ve had to sort that out. Sorry.’

4.58pm - Mr Charlton: ‘Ouch I’ve had that happen before. Your insurance should sort it. Sorry about your problem. When would you like to go?

4.58pm - Miss Hamlyn: ‘I won’t be doing today, sorry. Will have to get back to you’

5.00pm - Mr Charlton: ‘Another day?’

5.02pm - Mr Charlton: ‘We also have two others you may like’

5.03pm - Mr Charlton: ‘F***ing liar’

5.06pm - Miss Hamlyn: ‘Excuse me?’

5.08pm - Mr Charlton: ‘Just spoke with Fran that you couldn’t be bothered to cancel the appointment I find that so rude’

5.12pm - Miss Hamlyn: ‘Safe to say I won’t be using you as an agent. Maybe you should remember who your potential customers might be.’

5.31pm - Mr Charlton: ‘Your not a customer you were a tenant which we were helping and you didn’t show any respect cancelling the appointment you are meant to be a professional person’

5.44pm - Miss Hamlyn: ‘My car set on fire you obnoxious p****. If you want to drive past [an address] and check out the black 1.0 polo which burnt out before my eyes do if you want proof. Forget that, I’ll got to the local paper about this. How dare you.’

5.47pm - Mr Charlton: ‘How dare you!’

5.52pm - Mr Charlton: ‘Very silly little girl’

5.53pm - Miss Hamlyn: ‘I don’t see how that would be silly. And calling me a ‘little girl’ isn’t very clever either. There’s no chance I’m going to forget this now...’

5.53pm - Mr Charlton: ‘Now do not contact me again’

5.58pm - Mr Charlton: ‘I’ve asked you not to contact me one more text or call I will also take this further’
