Natalie met Shaun Marshall, 25, online in June last year and the couple got engaged just four months later

A woman who suffers from an incurable condition that causes her her bones to dislocate up to 300 times a day has vowed the walk down the aisle on her wedding day.

Wheelchair user Natalie Allan, 23, is thought to be the only person in the UK and just one of 30 people worldwide to suffer from a rare form of Ehlers Danlos syndrome.

The condition, commonly known as EDS, causes weakness in the collagen fibres that support joints resulting in multiple dislocations.

Law student Natalie experiences 
anything from 150 to 300 dislocations a day, forcing her to physically 
pop fingers, toes, ankles, hips, neck or her shoulders back into the 
joint.

But things took a
 turn for the better for Natalie when she met Shaun Marshall, 25, online
 in June last year and the couple got engaged just four months 
later.

Now Natalie, from Edinburgh, has vowed not to let her illness stop her walking down the aisle to wed Shaun next year.

She said: 'I'm always in pain and can't remember a day when I've not been taking morphine.

'On
 a good day I might dislocate up to 150 times and it can be anything 
from a little finger right up to my wrist, jaw, ankles, shoulders, hips 
or knees.

'Something like coughing or sneezing can make my joints dislocate. Life has been hard, but you just have to get on with it.

'When Shaun and I started chatting online he seemed really nice.

'I was honest straight away as I needed to know if he could cope with dislocating joints and seizures.

'And he is really wonderful and very supportive.

'We started going out and then discussed marriage in October.

'Then we went to the jewellers to pick out each other's rings and asked each other the next day.'

Natalie and Sam met online in June and he proposed in October - she says she will not let her debilitating illness stop her walking down the aisle on her wedding day

She added: 'All I want now is to be able to walk down the aisle to Shaun.

'It will be incredibly painful and I'll need help from my dad David and brother Peter.

'Shaun is so proud of me for being so determined to reach my goal.Â 

'Money is tight but we are hoping to have the wedding next year.

Shaun says: 'Natalie is like my Humpty Dumpty because I help put her together again. I'm so proud of her and she never lets this beat her'

'My condition is getting significantly worse every day and I don't know what I'll be like in 12 months.

'But this is my one dream and I am determined to take those steps down the aisle.

'I love Shaun so much and it would mean so much to be to be able to do it.'Natalie, who was diagnosed with the incurable condition at age 14, takes over 25 tablets a day to help minimise her discomfort.

Her condition also causes her to have up to 20 severe seizures each day leaving her in agonising pain.

She started using a wheelchair three years ago as her condition worsened and she now has very limited mobility.

Shaun, from Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, added: 'Natalie is like my Humpty Dumpty because I help put her together again.

'I'm so proud of her and she never lets this beat her.

'She is determined to walk down the aisle and it would mean the world to me.'
