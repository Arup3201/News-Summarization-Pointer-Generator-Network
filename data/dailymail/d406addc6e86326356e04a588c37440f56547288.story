Facing jail: David Chatwood (above) has admitted his part in a plot to steal £1.1million in gold and silver bullion from a company in Belgium

The stepfather of The Only Way Is Essex stars Sam and Billie Faiers has admitted plotting to steal £1.1million in gold and silver bullion.

David Chatwood, 57, took part in an international conspiracy to snatch the precious metal bars in Belgium.

He was arrested last year at the home he shares with the two celebrities and their mother Sue Wells in Brentwood, Essex.

Chatwood stood in the dock of the Old Bailey to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to steal bullion between June 1 and October 14, 2011.

Chatwood appeared in court alongside Brian Mulcahy, 46, John Corley, 52, Stanley Rose, 74, Matthew Middleton, 41, Kayracos Nicolas, 30, Andreas Nicolas, 50, Sheron Mancini, 52, Gary Cummings, 50, and David Gale, 55.

Bullion lorry driver Mulcahy, Chatwood, Rose and Gale all pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to steal.

The precious metal was said to be the property of Swiss company Metalor.

Mulcahay was discovered by police locked in his vehicle in Belgium on October 4 after ringing his employers to say he had been robbed.

Chatwood was seen to contact some of the other accused conspirators four days later at a Harvester restaurant in Dartford, Kent.

Nine days after the robbery, most of the bullion was discovered in an apartment and a hotel room in Antwerp which had been rented by Rose, the court heard.

Judge Peter Rook told the men: 'This is a very serious matter and a custodial sentence is inevitable.'

They will be sentenced later this year following the trial of Corley, Middleton, Kayracos Nicolas, Mancini and Cummings accused of the same offence and of conspiracy to launder the proceeds of the crime.

They pleaded not guilty to both charges.

Andreas Nicolas, Kayracos’ father, was cleared of both counts of conspiracy to steal following an application to dismiss.

All ten pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to conceal, disguise, convert or transfer criminal property.

The prosecution indicated the guilty pleas of Chatwood, Rose, Gale and Mulcahy were acceptable and they would not have to stand trial.

The gold and silver was stolen from a lorry in Antwerp on October 19 last year, while it was being transported to the UK.

Chatwood, from Brentwood, Essex; Mulcahy, from Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex; Corley, from Biggin Hill, Kent; and Rose, from Pilgrims Hatch, Brentwood, were all remanded in custody.

Middleton, from Buckhurst Hill, Essex; Kayracos Nicolas, of Winchmore Hill, north London; Andreas Nicolas, from Duxford, Cambs; Mancini, of Roydon, Harlow, Essex; and Cummings, from Ilford, Essex, are on conditional bail.
