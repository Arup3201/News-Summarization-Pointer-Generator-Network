Fired: Chelsea Welch has been the subject of more than a dozen online petitions and Facebook pages eager to help Ms Welch out

A fired waitress at a Missouri Applebee's is the subject of a massive internet push to be reinstated - a week after she was fired for posting a note by an angry customer on the internet.

Chelsea Welch lost her job at the St Louis restaurant after she posted a handwritten note written for a co-worker that objected to an 18 per cent automatic tip.

Since the story erupted last week, more than a dozen online petitions and 
Facebook pages eager to help Ms Welch out.

Some ask that she be reinstated. Others ask that supporters boycott Applebee's for axing her.

A petition on Change.org demands that the restaurant chain give her the job back.

As of this writing, the petition has nearly 2,500 signatures.

Ms Welch's troubles began with the bizarre passive aggressive note that was written on the bill.

Next to the line indicating that the tip had been added to the bill, the customer, a 
local pastor, crossed out the tip total, replaced it with a 'zero' and 
wrote: 'I give God 10 percent, why do you get 18?'

She then signed the bill 'Pastor Alois Bell.'

Befuddled, Ms Welch posted a photo of the bill on Reddit.com with the headline: 'My mistake sir, I'm sure Jesus will pay for my rent and groceries.'

Backing: Numerous Facebook pages have sprung up in support of Ms Welch since the story broke

Ms Welch said she was not the waitress who received the note, and posted it on behalf of a fellow Applebee's worker.

Ms Welch was fired after she posted the bill.

After the note became an internet sensation, the pastor began to receive angry calls and emails chastising her for the memo.

That
prompted her to call Applebee's to complain. Two days after the passive
aggressive bill was posted on Reddit, Ms Welch was fired.

But as the posting took on a life of its own on the internet this week, Ms Welch was fired.

She said that she's a dedicated employee and was shocked to hear the news.

Ms Welch told The Consumerist: 'When I posted this, I didn’t represent Applebee's in a bad light. In fact, I didn’t represent them at all. I did my best to protect the identity of all parties involved. I didn't break any specific guidelines in the company handbook - I checked.

Speaking out: Pastor Alois Bell says the note was a 'lapse in judgment'

She went on: 'But because this person got embarrassed that their selfishness was made public, Applebee’s has made it clear that they would rather lose a dedicated employee than lose an angry customer. That's a policy I can't understand.'

In a statement to The Smoking Gun, Applebee's spokesman Dan Smith said: 'Our franchisee has apologized to the guest,' and that the employee who posted the bill to Reddit 'is no longer employed by the franchise.'

Speaking to KTVI-TV last Thursday, the pastor said she should have thought better of the message she wrote.

Ms Bell, who preaches at the Truth in the Word Deliverance Ministries, told the station: That was a lapse in my judgment. I should've have did that. I apologize for that. I'm human. I did that.'

She also said that despite reports, she didn’t stiff the waitress. In fact, she left two tips - the 18 percent automatic tip and an additional $6 she left on the table.
