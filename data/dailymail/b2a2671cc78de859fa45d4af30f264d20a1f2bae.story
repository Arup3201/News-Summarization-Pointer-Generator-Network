In what may be the most unlikely duo to show up at any Golden Globes after party, The Good Wife Star Alan Cumming attended HBO's Sunday night soiree arm-in-arm with none other than  Monica Lewinsky.

The odd couple looked to be having a great time, with the one-time political hopeful all in black and the Broadway performer in an all nude-colored suit.

It was a rare, and high profile, glimpse at the duo who've been the best of friends since not long after Lewinsky became the country's most infamous intern.

Nude: Cumming wore a decidedly offbeat ensemble to go with his unexpected choice of dates

'We met at a party about 16 years ago — this Marie Claire party,' Cumming divulged to Andy Cohen in October. 'They'd done a thing about her and I'd done an article for Marie Claire and we were at the same table. [We] went for dinner and we just stayed friends.'

Fast forward to today and the two are still tight. 'She's really one of my best friends,' Cumming said. 'She's lovely.'

Asked what he thinks has coaxed Lewinsky back into the public eye after all these years--the 41-year-old was almost never heard from up until last May, when she wrote a widely-read article for Vanity Fair--Cumming said its just his friend's time to return to the world.

'To actually try and hide and not be a part, not be in the world, was so difficult and was so kind of frustrating for her,' he revealed.

The pair have been friends since the late 90s, right as Monica's infamy and Cumming's fame were in their infancy

'We met at a party about 16 years ago,' said Cumming, '[We] went for dinner and we just stayed friends.'
