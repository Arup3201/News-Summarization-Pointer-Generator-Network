Arsenal wonderkid Dan Crowley has put pen to paper on his first professional contract at the Emirates, a day after turning 17.

The highly-rated midfielder, whose style has been compared to current Gunners star Jack Wilshere, joined the club from Aston Villa in 2013 and has since impressed for both Arsenal and England at youth level.

Crowley confirmed the contract news on his Twitter account, posting a picture of him signing the deal alongside his family and agent.

Roy Hodgson spoke at length with Crowley while the England senior team were training at Arsenal's London Colney training ground in November, ahead of their friendly against Germany. 

He was poached from Aston Villa in 2013, with the centre-midfielder earning plaudits there as just a 12-year-old (even playing for the Under 16's at that age), being mentioned as 'the next Jack Wilshere'.

In fact, the England international and Gunners teammate himself showed his support, tweeting: 'Everybody follow @danielcrowley24 trust me when I say this kid is a player! Big future….'

Mutual friends: Arsene Wenger (also, with Hodgson), has been impressed with Crowley since he joined the club

Arsene Wenger showed he was keen by splashing out close to £1million on the playmaker to bring Crowley to the Emirates from Aston Villa last year.

The England youth international impressed in his first season with the Gunners, playing a key role in the early stages of the FA Youth Cup campaign. His best performance came in the fourth round against Peterborough, when he scored twice and provided four assists in the 6-0 fourth round victory over Peterborough United.

He also helped the under-19s to the Uefa Youth League quarter-finals last term, making three appearances in the competition. 

Arsenal have been busy in the transfer market this summer, signing David Ospina, Alexis Sanchez, Calum Chambers and Mathieu Debuchy - and the news of Crowley's deal is another boost for Gunners fans ahead of the start of the Premier League campaign.
