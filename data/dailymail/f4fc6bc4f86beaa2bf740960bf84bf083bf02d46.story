Ted Smith thinks it was fate that first brought him to Tukurua.

He started renting a room at the sprawling beachfront estate in Cottesloe, Perth in the 1970s and struck up a great friendship with its owner, Dorothea Cass, and for years he helped her take care of the 5000 sq m property and gardens.

When Miss Cass died in 1994 she had never married or had children and she left the entire heritage-listed estate to him.

Now he's put it on the market and the iconic property is set to sell for more than $50 million.

Mr Smith, now 80, has been taking care of the property on his own for two decades and he's ready to move on.

Real Estate agent Frank Torre said the property had had a lot of interest from Chinese and local investors

'I've been here for 43 years so I think it's time to down size,' Mr Smith told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Smith, who was born in Ireland in 1934, moved into the house aged 37.

He had moved to Australia some years earlier because he suffered from emphysema and asthma and wanted to be in a warmer, drier climate.

'I never got married because I left Ireland and I was in very poor health and that's why I came to Australia,' he said.

He spent time in various parts of WA working in agriculture and catering while also trading shares on the side, but in 1971 he wanted to get more involved in the share market so he moved back to Perth and got a job in the old Swan Brewery's share registry.

For 23 years Mr Smith helped Miss Cass take care of the sprawling gardens and do repairs around the estate

At the same time he moved into Tukurua, leasing a room off Miss Cass, who was about 63 at the time.

Miss Cass had inherited the property from her parents Berry and Catherine Cass, who ran the property as a boarding house and military headquarters throughout World War II.

Heritage listing documents state that when the property passed to Miss Cass in 1943 'a condition of inheritance was that Miss Cass did not marry'.

Mr Smith said he wasn't sure it that was true.

'I don't know about that, she never told me,' he said.

'But I've heard that rumour… rumours can be good and bad. She never did get married.'

After Mr Smith moved in the pair soon struck up a friendship. He was studying metaphysics at night school and Miss Cass, one of the first women in WA to get a university degree, loved talking about religion.  

'That's where Dorothea and I had a bond, she was very interested in religious studies and metaphysics and I was too,' he said.

'It was a very interesting time, she was very, very well-educated and very qualified in English.

'So that was a bond for us both. We had a lot of discussion in the evenings and at weekends.'

Tukurua is of great cultural significance to WA, as it was built in 1896 by WA's first attorney general Sir Septimus Burt to be his holiday home

Humble beginnings: This is how the property looked before extensive restoration

When Alan Bond purchased the Swan Brewery in 1981 Mr Smith stopped working there, but continued trading shares as well as helping Miss Cass with the upkeep of the estate.

'After the brewery I did share trading and as time went on, when Dorothea got more feeble, there was more to be done as far as minding the property and doing repairs,' he said.

'And of course with 5000 sq m it's quite a large piece of land and there were always things to do, repairs to be done.'

Miss Cass moved into a nursing home in 1993, and Mr Smith stayed to take care of Tukurua.

When she died the next year, aged 86, she left the entire property to him, which he said was a 'big surprise' and something he only found out Miss Cass was planning to do very late in her life.

'Because, like us all, she couldn't take it with her,' he said.

'And because she trusted me and she always recognised that I was good with finances and I didn't squander money and I didn't drink alcohol.'

In 1994 it was valued at $4 million. Now, it is set to sell for well over $50 million.

Mr Smith spent six years between 2003 and 2009 restoring the historic property at a cost of more than $5 million.

'I didn't have any option, the house was in very, very bad disrepair,' Mr Smith said of the restoration.

'I started with the roof which was in appalling condition and we had put a whole new roof on and then we couldn't stop, one thing led to another.

'I didn't start out with the intention of a complete rebuild but it went on and on and on.'

At the time it was valued at $4 million. Now, it is set to sell for well over $50 million

When Mr Smith moves out after 43 years he hopes to find a place to live nearby in Cottesloe with a big garden

Mr Smith said there were lots of different things that could happen to the house when it sold – including it being broken up into 10 separate blocks of land and developed.

'Definitely there are lots of options and it could be a beautiful home for some wealthy people or it could be developed with quite a lot of apartments, all depending on who the buyer is,' he said.

'I can't control that aspect when it's out of my hands but it would be very nice to see say a wealthy family and big family, hopefully, having a very beautiful home.'

When Mr Smith moves out after 43 years he hopes to find a place to live nearby in Cottesloe with a big garden.

'I live a very simple, humble life and I like it that way because too many people are making too much noise,' he said.

'I like to study and read and listen to classical music, which Dorothea liked very much too.'
