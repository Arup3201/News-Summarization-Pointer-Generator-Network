A grandmother who booked a dream package holiday to Portugal arrived at her hotel only to find she’d been taken to Spain.

Thomas Cook flew June Burns, 66, and friend Susan Jones to Portugal’s Faro Airport - before putting them on a bus and driving them 100 miles over the border to Spain’s Costa de la Luz.

When June returned to England, she complained to the tour operator, who has now offered her £200 compensation.

Disappointed: June Burns, 66, (pictured) is still waiting for the trip to Portugal that she asked Thomas Cook to book for her, after she was sent to Spain instead

But Mrs Burns, from Swinton, Manchester, is still waiting for the £1,247 Portuguese holiday she paid for.

She said: 'The customer service people keep saying, "What’s wrong? Didn’t you like the hotel?" And I keep saying the hotel was fine but I wasn’t in Portugal. It’s like booking a holiday to Scotland and ending up in England.

'If I sit in a seat and ask a holiday company to book me a holiday to the Algarve I expect to end up in the right country.'

Mrs Burns, 66, booked the break at the Thomas Cook store at Manchester's Trafford Centre.

She said: 'I used to work for a cruise operator so I’ve been to most of Europe but had never been to Portugal so I was really keen to go.'

The tour operator told Mrs Burns they’d found her a seven-day trip to the Algarve - the southernmost point of mainland Portugal.

Armed
with a booking confirmation, she hurried home to pack, her head full of
the region’s beautiful hilltop villages and beaches. But after the 
flight to Faro Airport the trip took an unexpected turn.

Holiday snaps: The friends said that while the hotel and food was nice, it wasn't what Mrs Burns had asked Thomas Cook to book for them

In Spain: Mrs Burns booked the holiday for her and her friend Susan Jones, right. They wanted to visit Portugal's Algarve, but ended up at the Punta Umbria Beach Hotel, left, on Spain's Costa de la Luz, near Huelva

June said: 'During the journey, people were commenting that there were Spanish road signs but we just dismissed it. Then we arrived at the hotel and it really began to dawn on us that it wasn’t Portugal.

'I went up to the rep and said "Where are we?" And she said "Spain, is there a problem?" And I said, "yes, I should be in the Algarve". She just said it would be difficult to move us because there might not be a free hotel and that we’d definitely enjoy it here.'

With no other option, Mrs Burns and her two companions forged ahead with the holiday at the Punta Umbria Beach hotel, near Huelva.

She added: 'The food was good and clean but we were stuck in Spain in the middle of nowhere.

'It’s the type of place where everyone just sits by the pool all day. I ended up spending a fortune on day trips to Seville, where I’d been before.'

June Burns and her friend Susan Jones were flown to Faro, in the Algarve region of Portugal, then driven 100 miles to a hotel in Punta Umbria, near Huelva, in Spain

Since her return, Mrs Burns has been twice to the Trafford Centre store to complain and made three calls to customer services.

Only after the press was alerted was she offered compensation.

A spokeswoman for Thomas Cook UK & Ireland said: 'We know how important holidays are for our customers, and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that may have occurred when Mrs Burns booked her holiday with us.

'While Mrs Burns did not query her holiday confirmation documents prior to travel, whereupon we could have amended her booking, we can confirm that we are speaking to her with a view to resolving this matter to her satisfaction.'

Mrs Burns' holiday confirmation document says they are going to ‘Costa de la Luz, Algarve’.

Some travel agents do refer to Costa de la Luz as ‘the Spanish Algarve’ - but Punta Umbria Beach Hotel is not in the Algarve.

On Thomas Cook’s website it comes under the heading of Spain with no mention of the word ‘Algarve’.
