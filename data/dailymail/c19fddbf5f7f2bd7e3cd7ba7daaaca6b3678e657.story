Connoisseur: William Hague chose £150 and £200 wines to serve at an event for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee

He once boasted he could drink 14 pints of beer in a day, but William Hague’s tastes have become more refined since he gained high office.

The Mail on Sunday has discovered that the Foreign Secretary takes time off from the world stage to personally select fine wines  - some worth £200 a bottle - for official functions.

Meanwhile Ministers, officials and guests downed more than 3,900 bottles of wines and spirits in the space of only nine months last year.

The Whitehall booze bill, paid for 
with public funds, includes four bottles of Paul Jaboulet Aine 
Hermitage, normally £450 each, and two bottles of ‘a luscious and 
harmonious’ Bordeaux worth £320 each.

The
 disclosure that Mr Hague acts as the Government’s unofficial sommelier
 has been criticised by opponents who say that such lavish expenditure 
is at odds with the Coalition’s austerity agenda.

Last
 night Labour MP Simon Danczuk said: ‘I’m astonished and appalled that 
the Foreign Secretary would take time out of dealing with the crisis in 
Syria to personally select expensive bottles of wine for functions.

'Hasn’t he got more pressing matters to deal with?

'And when the government is constantly repeating the mantra that “we’re all in it together” it smacks of hypocrisy that ministers are quaffing expensive bottles of wine while ordinary people are struggling.’

The Foreign Office, which has overall responsibility for the Government’s wine cellar, released the list when The Mail on Sunday complained to the Information Commissioner after a Freedom of Information request led to a nine-month battle.

Mr Hague personally intervened to select the wine at an event celebrating the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee on June 5 last year – as he struggled with the crisis in Syria.

The event was attended by the heads of Commonwealth states and senior members of the diplomatic corps. 

On May 28, Mr Hague’s private secretary told Robert Alexander, head of Government hospitality: ‘The Foreign Secretary thought that the wine list looked good.

'For red, he suggested either Chateau Cos D’Estournel 1990, or the Chateau Leoville- Poyferre 1990, not/not [sic] the Chateau Margaux 1983.’

The two wines chosen by Mr Hague cost £150 and £200 respectively and are rated ‘A’ in the Government’s 61-page ‘stock report’, which details all the alcoholic beverages available for functions.

The bill could have been a lot higher had the Foreign Secretary not rejected the Chateau Margaux 1983, which is priced at about £400 a bottle.

Mr Hague’s office was responding to an email from Mr Alexander, in which he wrote: ‘Sorry to bother you. I know the SofS [Secretary of State] is travelling today and just wondered if there is any feed-back on the suggested wines?

‘I cannot remember if I had told you that we have re-jigged the French/English balance slightly: Champagne pre-lunch, English white, Claret, and now vintage English Sparkling (Nyetimber 2005) for dessert/toast. I have assumed FS [Foreign Secretary] will not want port or cognac offered.’

He added: ‘We need to go to print on the menu soon.’

The
 list, titled Cellar Wines And Spirits Consumption April 2012 To 
December 2012, includes 184 bottles of champagne, costing up to £200 a 
bottle, and 343 bottles of English sparkling wine, including Nyetimber 
Classic Cuvee 2005 which costs £30 a bottle.

It also shows that in June alone, Whitehall officials and their guests consumed £11,750 worth of the Chateau Cos D’Estournel 1990, one of the tipples chosen by Mr Hague.

Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Wine and Spirit Group, said: ‘These are very top dignitaries that we are entertaining, prime ministers, presidents and foreign ministers from all over the world.’

The MP, who said he spends only £5 on wine for himself, added: ‘We need to serve them a reasonable quality, but of course there does need to be a balance.’

A Foreign Office spokesman last night was unable to clarify at what function guests drank the £450  bottles of wine.

She added: ‘The Government Hospitality Wine Cellar is now self-financing.

'The Foreign Secretary and Ministers are occasionally consulted on options for wines for Government events, as they are on all the planning details.’
