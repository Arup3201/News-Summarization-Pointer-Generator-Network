Ravel Morrison has risked the wrath of West Ham supporters after the controversial midfielder posted a picture of himself on Instagram wearing an Arsenal shirt.

But he was quick to tweet a message to calm any irate Hammers fans, insisting he loves his current club and the manner in which they have stood by him.

He wrote: 'West Ham is I'm [sic] my (heart) Love the Club and the way the have stood by me.'

The 21-year-old was in Manchester Magistrates Court on Thursday where he was facing charges for two counts of common assault after allegedly attacking his former girlfriend.

The court heard that the England Under 21 international threatened to throw acid in Reah Mansoor’s face and blow up her house in a course of harassment.

Morrison, who spoke only to confirm his name, age and address, sat in the dock at the court for the brief hearing as the harassment allegation was also added to the charges.

District Judge Khalid Qureshi bailed Morrison to appear at Manchester Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on August 28.

His bail conditions are that he lives in Canary Wharf, London, does not contact directly or indirectly the two women complainants, does not go on to the street where they live, and does not enter the Greater Manchester area except for a court appearance, to see his lawyers or to visit for a West Ham game in the area and to return to London immediately after the match.

But hours after his court appearance, Morrison uploaded an image on the social media site wearing the kit of the Hammers London rivals seating in the driver’s seat of a Ferrari sports car.

Morrison, who joined West Ham from Manchester United for £650,000 in January 2012, has admitted before that he is a Gunners supporter and is understood to have followed the club since childhood.

But with his future at Upton Park uncertain, Hammers fans are unlikely to favour his choice of clothing ahead of the start of the new season.

The Hammers face Arsenal later this season on December 28. But Morrison, who underwent minor groin surgery last month, is unlikely to feature at all in West Ham’s first Premier League match of the season is against Tottenham on August 16.
