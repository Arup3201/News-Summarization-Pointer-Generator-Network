The list included £8,000 for killing his wife Heather McGarry and £500 for setting fire to their matrimonial home.The price increased to £50,000 if they managed to kill his wife, their children and Mrs McGarry's friend. 

Andrew McGarry, 39, was already serving a long sentence in prison for ramming a car into his matrimonial home and then setting it on fire - but had still decided to wage a 'reign of terror' upon his 28-year-old wife, Bolton Crown Court heard.

Andrew McGarry was serving time in prison for ramming his car into his wife's home in Bolton and setting fire to it when he drew up a 'price list' he gave to two inmates with details of how he wanted her to be harmed 

Andrew McGarry, an architect, is accused of handing the 'price list' to inmates at  Forest Bank Prison 

The court heard he even dished out detailed floor plans of the family home, detailing the layout of the rooms, the location of valuable property and even the alarm code. 

He later gave an inmate his wife's parents address and said he wanted revenge as it was a year to the day after they had complained to police about him, it is alleged.  

McGarry, a father of three, approached two inmates with a list of payouts for varying degrees of attacks which could be carried out on his former wife and their next door neighbour named as Andrea, and make it look like a burglary.

The list included £100 for causing damage to the windows at both addressees, £500 for setting fire to the matrimonial home, and £8,000 for killing his wife.

One of McGarry's lists read 'If you get Heather herself £8,000 and if you get Andrea, £1,400' claiming he had the money in a trust fund and said the fee would increase to £50,000 if both were killed along with his children.

Police were called in after one of the inmates handed over details of McGarry's plans to guards at Forest Bank Jail in Salford, the jury was told. 

The jury was played CCTV footage which showed McGarry ramming his car into his wife's home in Bolton

The court heard McGarry had previously ploughed his Vauxhall Zafira into his £120,000 end-terraced house after the breakdown of his marriage.

He had married Heather in August 2006 and the couple had three children Lewis, eight, Lacey, six and Elliott, four.

But she described him as 'a Jekyll and Hyde type personality' in the course of their marriage.

The court heard there was domestic violence by him and she was granted a non molestation order on 14 June 2012 for one year - a form of a restraining order.

She filed for divorce in July 2012. 

However on July 24 that year dramatic CCTV pictures from cameras, installed by McGarry himself and shown to the jury, captured the moment the blue hatchback clattered into the front garden and then into the house before the vehicle burst into flames.

Neil Fryman, prosecuting, said just a month after McGarry was sentenced in February 2013 he befriended fellow inmate James Plaice and told him the reasons he had been sent to prison. 

Then just a few weeks later he started asking if he knew anybody who would be willing to 'do damage' to his house where his wife was still living.

The car is shown on the footage (left) being rammed into the house, and then bursting into flames. It then set fire to the house, causing a lot of damage to the end terrace home in Bolton where Mrs McGarry was living 

Mr Fryman added: 'He explained he wanted damage caused at the windows of the property in order to force her out. Not content with what he had done, he wanted further damage. He offered to pay James Plaice cash if he arranged someone on the outside to do it. 

James Plaice was provided with the address and played along with this and said would carry out when he had no intention of doing so.' 

Days later the pair met again and McGarry gave Plaice tobacco in payment, seemingly accepting damage had been done to his wife's home. The conversations that escalated and McGarry told his fellow inmate he wanted someone to break into the house and steal items of property and then to set the house on fire.

Mr Fryman said: 'He told James Plaice if he couldn't have the house then nobody could. He went see him in his cell and handed him detailed plans of the house, showing the layout of the house and the location of valuable property and coloured pictures of his house retained from the court case.

'He told James Plaice he would pay him about £2,000 if he arranged for the house to be set on fire. He went on to explain that items of property could be stolen as payment.' 

The court heard McGarry gave Plaice details of his alarm code and code for the safe. He said he wasn't bothered if his wife was in the property if it set on fire. 

However he did tell of specific days his children would not be there.

Mr Fryman added: 'James Plaice played along saying he wanted a Playstation console. James Plaice became increasingly concerned that he was intent in getting someone to set fire to the house and getting his wife harmed. He played along but realised McGarry's wife was in real danger.' 

Mrs McGarry's home in Bolton was left badly damaged after Mr McGarry rammed his car into the house

Mr McGarry allegedly told an inmate he also wanted revenge on his wife's parents and wanted a fire arranged 

Plaice later told another inmate Colin Brady about the plot and handed him the plans and paperwork. Brady later approached McGarry to ask him what he wanted. 

McGarry told him 'a reign of terror on both my ex-wife and her next door neighbour'.

Mr Fryman added: 'He said to Colin Brady that he wanted his ex-wife dead and wasn't bothered how it was done or who got in there. Colin Brady led him to believe that he would sort it out and carry out the plans. He asked him to write down what he wanted doing.

'He wrote down addresses and a list of what he wanted doing and the price he would pay him.

Brady took the paper and passed it to a prison officer because he was so concerned, the jury heard. 

Mr Fryman told the court 'Colin Brady handed to the police the plans and paperwork along with the list of prices that he had received. 'If you get heather herself £8,000 and if you get Andrea £1,400.' The prosecution say these were very detailed plans and when one compares and contrasts to 24th July they are very determined plans where the defendant meant business.'

McGarry continued to approach Brady, unaware the police were investigating him. 

Last March he told Brady it was coming up to the first anniversary of the day Heather's parents went to police to complain about him.

'He said the date was 31st May and as a result he wanted Heather's parents' house damaging and their cars setting alight,' said Mr Fryman. 

'He handed to Colin Brady a piece of paper with Heather's parents' address in Rochdale and a hand drawn map. McGarry told Colin Brady that he now wanted as many windows as possible breaking at heather's house and drew a sketch.' 

But on April 3 McGarry spoke to Brady again and said he now wanted his wife, children and his wife's neighbour all dead and wanted someone to arrange a fire. 

Mr Fryman said:  'He asked to arrange a fire at Heather's address as soon as he could and said he would pay him an increased amount of £50,000 and would be able to pay him because he had a trust fund from his father in excess of that amount.'

McGarry who ran his own design and architect practise denies two charges of soliciting murder and three charges of encouraging or assisting the commission of criminal offences.

The trial continues.
