A 29-year-old Moscow lawyer shot dead five people in front of his ex-girlfriend who had ended their relationship ten months ago.

Several hours before his frenzied attack on Wednesday, Dmitry Vinogradov posted a hate-filled manifesto on the web vowing 'to destroy as many parts of the human compost as possible'.

Shooting from a gun in each hand, his trail of destruction left three men and two women dead, and severely wounded another man and woman.

Witness: Anya Kaznikova saw her colleagues shot in the head by her ex-boyfriend, ten months after she broke up with him

Ex-girlfriend Anya Kaznikova, 26, witnessed part of his sickening killing spree but was not wounded during the attack, it was reported, contradicting earlier reports in the Russian media that she had been shot.

All the dead victims were shot in the head at a Moscow pharmacy company where he worked.

Among his victims were her finance department colleagues who, he claimed, advised her to end their relationship.

A
 former World Wildlife Foundation volunteer who saved seagulls from an 
oil slick in 2010, he was finally overpowered by workers and security 
men after he ran out of bullets, and armed police arrived to arrest him 
at the scene of his murderous attack.

Police sources claimed the motive for his killing spree was being spurned by Ms Kaznikova, but his sinister manifesto, posted at 4.56am, drew immediate comparisons with Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik, who shot dead 69 people at a camp last year.  

Police say Vinogradov came to the Rigla plant at Chermyanskaya Street, Moscow, where his ex-girlfriend worked, at 9am and was allowed in as a lawyer for the company.

Miss Kaznikova said Vinogradov was initially nice, buying her cinema tickets and her favourite pancakes, before becoming possessive and angry

The killer then went to the toilet where he changed into army fatigues and went out into the depot with a Saiga hunting rifle and an Italian-made Benelli shotgun.

He gunned down two men on the stairs before going into his ex-girlfriend's office where he shot his other victims. 

In a chilling confession, he later told police: ‘We were dating for a long time but in January this year we split up.

‘I tried to get her back but failed. In March I bought a rifle and 200 bullets and a uniform. 

‘My colleagues are to blame - they advised Anya to split with me.

‘I came into the office where Anya worked and said: “Hello, colleagues”, and she saw how I began to shoot all of them. 

‘I wanted them to see how strong I was and then I planned to kill myself.’

His male victims were named as Alexander Biryuk, Andrei Tertiakov and Denis Moiseev, all 33, and the women were Elena Lapshina and Natalia Plekhanova, both 25.

Yaroslava Sergenyuk, 24, was struck by a bullet to her chest which pierced her lung, and another which damaged her nose. She was rushed to hospital by helicopter and is fighting for her life.

Nikita Strelnikov, 29, suffered bullet wounds to his lung, liver, stomach and both legs after acting as a human shield seeking to prevent bullets striking the women.

Ms Kaznikova said after the attack: 'We started dating in summer last year. He made me little sweet presents, took me to the cinema but he was too romantic for me, wenever got too close.

'We finally split up in winter when he started being angry. He was really jealous. In January he sent me a text message and blamed me formaking him feel angry. He also called me rude names.'

She did not speak about the shooting, though newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said she was in her office during the horrific killings.

Vinogradov’s mother Elena Vinogradova revealed on Wednesday that the couple had rowed before breaking up over a romantic trip he had booked to take her to Scotland.

She said: ‘He quarrelled with that girl Anya from finance department. He is from the law department.

'I understand it that his shooting was in the finance department. It is likely that they mocked him somehow.

‘Before they split up, he bought her a trip to Edinburgh, ordered everything, paid for it all, and some two days before it she said: “I'm not going”.

'He was in a horrible depression after that.’

He had been on medication to cope with his depression but had not taken it the day before the shooting.

Ms Vinogradova said: ‘He was absolutely quiet yesterday,’ adding she had tried to discourage his interest in shooting.

In his manifesto posted on a Russian social site which also included racist images, Vinogradov declared:  ‘I hate human society and I am disgusted to be a part of it! I hate the senselessness of human life! I hate this very life! I see only one way to justify it: to destroy as many parts of the human compost as possible. 

‘This is the only right thing which everyone of us can do in his life, it is the only way to justify it, the only way to make this world better.

‘The way of surviving and self-perfection of a man is a mistake, it leads to a dead end, to destroying of all the rest, of all what is really alive.

Another life: Vinogradov is pictured saving a seagull from an oil slick in 2010 as a World Widelife Foundation  volunteer

‘Evolve! Become aware of your real 
meaning and place in this world! Understand that you are aliens here, 
you are the genetic rubbish which should not be here, rubbish which 
appeared accidentally, as a result of a mistake in evolution, rubbish 
which must be destroyed.’

One image carried the slogan 'End Racism Kill Everyone', featuring a black child with a gun.

He
 described his views as ‘ultra-conservative’ and also said on his site 
that the ‘main thing in life’ was ‘making the world better’.

He listed shooting as an interest and is believed to have legally owned the firearms he used.

One of his favourite films was listed as Natural Born Killers. 

He
 hated television, describing it as the ‘sewage of human intellect’.  
His favourite quote is listed as ‘hope is the worst evil because it 
prolongs human suffering’ by Friedrich Nietzsche.

A police statement said: ‘Three men and two young women sitting at their desks died on the spot.

‘One more man and another young woman were wounded, they are receiving medical help.’

A source said: ‘He told investigators that he had fallen in love with a girl who was a pharmacist, but his feelings were not reciprocated.

‘Because of that he drank for five days and today he came in and opened fire.’

Another source said he would undergo psychological assessment. He said: ‘He is of course not Breivik but the analogy suggests itself.’

He graduated in 2009 from the Academic Law University in Moscow and worked as a company lawyer for the Rigla chain of pharmacies.
