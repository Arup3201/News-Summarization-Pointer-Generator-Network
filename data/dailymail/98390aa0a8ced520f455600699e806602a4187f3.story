The scale of the leadership crisis engulfing Ed Miliband was revealed yesterday when Labour was forced to wheel out Neil Kinnock to defend him.

Lord Kinnock, who led the party to two crushing general election defeats in 1987 and 1992, sought to blame the media for the leader’s woes.

His desperate defence came as allies claimed Mr Miliband’s leadership is only being criticised because he is  on course to become Prime Minister next year with a Commons majority of at  least 40 seats.

Mockery: Ed Miliband's similarities to Lord Kinnock led the Guardian to publish this photomontage of him morphing into his predecessor

Loyal Shadow Cabinet members took to the airwaves to allege that a mysterious nexus of ‘vested interests’ involving banks, energy firms and the media were seeking to undermine Mr Miliband because they felt threatened by him.

But Mr Miliband was rocked by more disastrous poll results. A YouGov poll found that 51  per cent think he is a weak leader, 56 per cent think he is out of touch with ordinary people, and 60 per cent think he would not  be up to the job of leading the country.

Lord Kinnock condemned the ‘vindictiveness’ of the media attacks on Mr Miliband. But he added: ‘It won’t stop him; his genuine strengths of thought, action and toughness will get through and help to win victory.

‘Ed has great personal and political courage. The way in which he’s taken on [Rupert] Murdoch, big energy, banks,  and effectively prevented  our military engagement in  Syria – just some examples – shows that. He’s got high  intelligence and articulates  deep concerns.’

When Mr Miliband defeated his brother David to become leader in 2010, Lord Kinnock was said to have exclaimed, ‘We’ve got our party back.’

On Saturday the Left-leaning Guardian newspaper highlighted the similarities between them  by publishing a photomontage  of Mr Miliband morphing into Lord Kinnock.

A Conservative spokesman said: ‘You know things are getting desperate when Labour resorts to rolling out Neil Kinnock to shore up Ed Miliband.

‘Ed Miliband’s supporters  can blame the media all they like, but people in the Labour Party are realising he is a weak leader who just isn’t up to the job.  Miliband has no plan for  the country. He is a shameless opportunist. The only thing he stands for is more borrowing and higher taxes.’

Yesterday there were damaging claims of fresh tensions between Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who is said to want to install his wife Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, as party leader.

And John Denham, a former Labour frontbencher who  has long argued Labour needs  to try to rebuild support in  the south of England, warned that the party is losing working-class voters.

It emerged that he told a conference earlier this month that working-class voters ‘don’t believe they are in any story that Labour is telling about the future of this country’.

Senior figures inside the party have been voicing doubts about Mr Miliband’s ability to connect with the electorate  for months, following poor  local and European election results and a series of gaffes, including a photocall in which  he struggled to eat a bacon sandwich.

Yesterday, Phil Taylor,  a former speech writer for Mr Miliband, said his relationship with Mr Balls was ‘just as bad as the Blair-Brown era’ and Labour’s economic policy was ‘nonsense’.

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham told BBC Radio 4 that pressure was only increasing on Mr Miliband ‘because he has put us in a position where we can win in ten months’ time’.

He said ‘vested interests’ in the media, big business and the financial sector were using their ‘powerful influences’ to ‘destabilise’ the Labour leader, who they felt threatened by.

Labour’s work and pensions spokesman, Rachel Reeves,  told the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme: ‘Opinion polls  today show that if there was a general election today we’d  have a majority of more than  40. Ed’s going to win next year and he’s going to make a great prime minister.’

Labour will ‘pause’ the Government’s flagship welfare reform if it wins power, pending a review by spending watchdogs, Miss Reeves said.

She said her party supported the principle of universal  credit, which is gradually  replacing six out of work benefits and tax credits, and hoped to ‘rescue’ it.

Miss Reeves claimed the programmes had been in ‘chaos’ under Iain Duncan Smith.

But the Work and Pensions Secretary said implementation of universal credit, which is designed to ensure it always pays to take a job or more hours while on benefits or tax credits, was now ‘working well’.
