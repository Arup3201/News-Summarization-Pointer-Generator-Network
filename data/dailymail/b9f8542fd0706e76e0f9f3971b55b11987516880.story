Andy Murray continued his quest to reach the season-ending ATP World Tour finals by booking his place in the quarter-finals of the Shenzhen Open in China.

Murray started the week in 11th place in the Race with only the top eight guaranteed a place at the lucrative event at the O2 Arena in November.

His desire to qualify took him to Shenzhen where he began his campaign with a comfortable 6-3, 6-3 win over India's Somdev Devvarman on Thursday.
