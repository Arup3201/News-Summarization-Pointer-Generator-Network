They have traditionally been shunned from the world's catwalks in favour of stick-thin women.

But the rise in popularity of plus-size models is gathering pace as London Fashion Week prepares to host its first show featuring only 
fuller-figured women.

Taking place between 15-16 February 2012, the first London Plus Size Fashion Weekend (LPSFW) is being organised by fashion boutique Trapped in a Skinny World and plus size magazine Evolve.

First of its kind: London Plus Size Fashion Week will feature fuller size models, just like Mark Fast does in his shows

Split between Beach Blanket Babylon and Shoreditch Town Hall in East London, the event hopes to attract over 500 people and will showcase the work of designers, speakers, models and retailers focusing on curvy women who wear dress size 14 and above.

LPSFW will be sponsored by popular plus size clothing line Simply Be and models from Milk Management will strut the catwalk donning collections from all over Europe and America.

Main stage: The event will take place in February's Fashion Week and is sponsored by Simply Be

Aside from the show itself, there will be a whole host of activities taking place such as a styling masterclass and plus size pop-up shops, as well as a discussion on the plus size market with panelists like Velvet D'Armour, the first plus size model to walk in a Jean Paul Gautier show and Jessica Kane, chief executive of American plus size magazine Skorch.

The London Plus Size Fashion Weekend 
will provide a platform to bring the various elements of fashion aimed 
at the plus size market together.

This will be the first event of its 
kind, creating a community of beautiful and successful plus size women 
to mingle, talk clothes and feel comfortable about themselves

Speaking about the exciting plans, organiser Remi Ray said: 'The idea behind the London Plus Size Fashion weekend came to me a few years ago.

'I had always felt uncomfortable trying to fit into mainstream fashion when my shape didnâ€™t conform to what is perceived to be mainstream sizes.

'After completing my fashion degree I decided to look further into supporting the plus size market and started Trapped in a skinny World, which is a plus-size vintage fashion boutique.'

However, Remi, who studied at London College of Fashion, wanted to go further and put a spotlight on the plus size market by hosting the London Plus Size Fashion weekend show around the same time as the world famous London Fashion Week when fashion's focus will be on the capital.

Remi added: 'We are working night and
 day to make sure the first ever London plus size fashion weekend event 
will be a huge success and the first of many.

'If
 our event makes at least one plus size woman overcome her fears and 
encourages her to indulge in her love for clothes and feeling great, 
then we will have done our job!'.

Editor
 of plus size magazine SLiNK Rivkie Baum said: 'We think it's fantastic 
that there will be a fashion show that recognises plus size women and 
designers this February.

'However
 until we see designers within mainstream fashion shows using models of 
different sizes across the catwalk plus size women remain segregated 
from the fashion industry.

'But this is a good step in the right direction.'

Sponsors: Simply Be will be sponsoring the new fashion show, Gok Wan has designed clothes for them before, as captured by SLiNK magazine
