Amanda Knox will never return to Italy to face justice, her grandmother has declared, and nor will any other member of the Knox family.

Elisabeth Huff, Knox's maternal grandmother and closest confidante, whom she wrote to often from prison, said that her granddaughter had been 'persecuted' in Italy.

Knox, and former boyfriend Raffaelle Sollecito, 29, spent four years in prison for the 2007 murder of her British flatmate Meredith Kercher, who was found with her throat slit in the cottage they shared in Perugia.

face retrial , her grandmother Elisabeth Huff (right)Â  has said

The pair were freed on appeal in 2011, but Italy's highest court this week dramatically quashed their acquittal, ordering a retrial.

Knox does not need to return for the new trial, but if found guilty, Italy could demand her extradition.

Mrs Huff, the first member of her 
immediate family to speak out about the family's true feelings, said 
that Italian prosecutors' pursuit of her granddaughter amounted to 
'harassment'.

Meredith Kercher, 21, was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house she shared with Knox in November 2007

She told the Italian newspaper La Stampa: 'It's a persecution. She has already been tried twice. Why reopen it.

The prosecutors want to find other guilty parties at any cost and they will never give up. That is the view of Amanda and our entire family.

'Because of this Amanda will not return to Italy for the new trial. She will never go back. No one in our family will.'

Mrs Huff, who was with Knox at her mother's house when she was told of the retrial, told how her granddaughter wept.

'She was hurt, sad, in pain, Mrs Huff remembered, 'She had thought that the nightmare was finally over.

'She cried, she repeated that she was innocent.

'She said she was scared and that it was impossible to live a normal life like this.' It's difficult to move on when you are 'constantly harassed' she added.

Knox's book, due out on April 30, will explain her innocence, her grandmother said.

Sollecito,
 who has already released a book about his experience, has registered a 
company which will re-examine and solve cold cases, according to Italian
 media.

Knox and her then boyfriend Raffaelle Sollecito, who always professed their 
innocence, were initially found guilty in 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 
25 years in prison respectively
