Bethenny Frankel's new boyfriend was expelled
from an exclusive college after being accused of raping a fellow student, it
can be revealed today.

Financier Michael Cerussi III - who at 34 is
nine years younger than his new girlfriend - was kicked out of Union College in
Schenectady, NY, in 2000 after a freshman accused him and a fraternity brother
of having sex with her against her will.

He fought the case until 2003.

MailOnline is not naming the alleged victim
out of respect for her privacy and due to the nature of the allegations. She
declined to comment.

Controversial past: Cerussi was kicked out of Union College in Schenectady, NY, in 2001 after a freshman accused him and a fraternity brother of having sex with her against her will

Denial: Cerussi challenged the claims and sued the college for defamation and discriminating against him because he was a man. His two year legal battle saw his case dismissed

Close: Bethenny and Michael Cerussi III - nicknamed 'Mac' - enjoyed New Year's Eve together at the Mondrian in South Beach, Miami

Cerussi, 34, the son of a prominent New York
lawyer, was seen this week frolicking on the beach with Real Housewives of New
York star Bethenny, 43, on a sun-soaked New Year's Eve trip to Miami.

The couple were seen sharing a tender kiss on New
Year’s Eve at the Mondrian Hotel in South Beach in Miami and have been staying
together at the Delano Hotel.

Cerussi goes by the nickname 'Mac' and works
in financial services, but back in 2000 he was a student at the prestigious UC,
which dates back to 1795.

The school charges $58,000 a year - meaning it
ranks among the most expensive colleges in America.

According to court documents filed at the
Southern District of New York court in Westchester County - and seen by MailOnline -  Cerussi was a 22-year-old senior
at the time when he and fraternity brother Frederik Bailey met the victim on
November 11 2000, a Friday night, at a bar near campus.

The documents allege: ‘(The alleged victim)
accompanied them back to their fraternity house and had sexual intercourse with
both men.’

The following night the victim got a call
from John Gregory, another of Cerussi’s fraternity brothers, inferring he knew
what she had done.

The alleged victim then went to a nearby hospital and
told a nurse she had been raped.

Cerussi and Bailey were suspended whilst
Kathleen Schurick, an associate dean of students at UC, carried out her own
internal investigation and found them both guilty, the court documents state.

A second hearing was held during which,
surprisingly, Cerussi was allowed to personally question two of the victim’s
roommate and close friend, but he was found guilty again.

Both he and
Bailey were expelled in December 2000.

The case only came to light because Cerussi sued UC and alleged that ‘because he is male, Schurick and (associated dean Patricia) Williams discriminated against him and pre-determined his guilt, thereby violating both UC's Disciplinary Procedural Guidelines’.

After numerous legal issues the case was dismissed in January 2003 with the approval of UC, Cerussi and the alleged victim.

The case was dismissed ‘with prejudice’ meaning it can never be reopened. There are not details of a settlement, if one was reached.

Today, a source close to Cerussi told MailOnline: 'Michael was expelled after a girl accused him of sexually assaulting her and the school expelled him.

'However, she never made a claim to police, she never got a rape kit and she never filed a police report.

'Michael actually sued her and the school for defamation of character.'

In the end, the source claimed that Michael was invited back to the college, but chose to enroll at the University of Connecticut, from where he eventually graduated.

The Schenectady Police Department records office said that there was no record of any incident with Cerussi’s name on it dating back to the start of 2000, the year the alleged rape took place.

Union College declined to comment.

Cerussi’s aunt Nancy Mcenaney 
dismissed her nephew’s past behaviour and said Bethenny was lucky to 
have him because he was a ‘great guy’ who loved older women.

Mrs Mcenaney, 58, told MailOnline: ‘He’s got a good heart. Everything about him is great.

‘He
 treats me like a sister. I don’t think the age gap (with Frankel) is a 
problem - Mac is like a brother to me...he likes to go on holiday with 
his mum’.

She added that 
Cerussi’s father Michael - a feted corporate lawyer who died in 2011 - 
was ‘tough’ on him and that he wanted him to go to law school after 
Union College.

However, Michael made his own way in the world and entered into finance.

Speaking about the alleged rape, Mrs Mcenaney said that ‘nothing came of it’ and that ‘it was all dropped’.

She said: ‘All college kids get into some sort of trouble’.

The good life: The couple orders snacks and drinks as the staff hover over them

Ceruissi’s
 friend added: ‘Michael’s not looking for fame, or to be a celebrity. 
He’s just a guy Bethenny met and they’re hanging out – he’s a great guy.

Meanwhile, Bethenny - who is going through a bitter divorce from husband Jason Hoppy with wholm she has daughter Brynn - has ben clearly enjoying her time in 
Miami and posted a number of positive tweets including 'a nice beach day
 in Miami. Jumping into the ocean to plunge info the new year (sic).'

She is also determined to make 2014 better than last year. 

She wrote: 'In 2014, promise yourself to go get 'em, never settle, and always try to come from 'A Place of Yes'.

'Happy
 new year!!! I am so grateful for u and love u so much. 013 was a mixed 
bag. I can feel the energy & 014 is going to be great! Xo
