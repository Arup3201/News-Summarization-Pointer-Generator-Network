New child protection policies could see Santa banned from taking present requests  on his lap after parents and activists call for increased levels of regulation during the festive season.

Queensland parents on social media sparked the debate, expressing concerns regarding the tradition of young children posing for photographs or whispering their wish list on Santa's lap in the lead up to Christmas.

Hetty Johnson, spokesperson for child abuse prevention organisation Bravehearts, has demanded that shopping malls update their protection policies, leaving commentators divided over whether the practice should be reconsidered, or whether the issue is an example of political correctness taken too far.

New child protection policies could see Santa banned from taking present requests on his lap after parents and activists call for increased levels of regulation during the festive season

Ms Johnson said, 'What we would like to see is shopping centre owners updating their child protection policies,' reported the Courier Mail.

'The directive would be for children to stand beside Santa, unless parents or children request to sit on his knee. Shopping centres have duty of care to protect children on premises.'

One 'Santa', who has had over a decade of bringing the 'Ozzie Santa'  experience working for Singing Telegrams with the Sydney Children's Hospital, Channel 9, and Channel 10, said that while he understands that parents might be concerned, children are never forced to sit on his lap.

'The little ones tend to be a bit frightened, because they don't know who I am but they soon figure out that I'm the person who gives presents,' he said.

'From my own personal experience, what we're having is a tradition that parents have taken from their own childhood that they want their kids to have,' he said. 

'Parents get the children to stand next to me or try to put them on my knee. Sometimes they cry and are quickly taken off.'

'The experience does vary, so while they generally sit on my knee, it's personalised depending on what the parents want and how the children react.' 

Charmaine Ohl, 32, used to work as a photographer for a Christmas experience company, and  has a two-year-old daughter.

Every state in Australia requires checks and certification for those who work with minors, including Santa's, youth group leaders, and church volunteers, among other professions

Charmaine Ohl, 32, said that she grew up sitting on Santa's lap and had never had a bad experience

The full-time mother and receptionist, from Rockhampton in Queensland, said that she grew up sitting on Santa's lap and had never had a bad experience.

'When I worked as a Santa photographer, they never force kids to sit on Santa's lap. Kids just won't do what they don't want to do,' she said. 

'All the 'santa's' are police checked, it's perfectly safe. All the workers are checked, no one has a criminal history,' Charmaine said. 

Every state in Australia requires checks and certification for those who work with minors, including Santa's, youth group leaders, and church volunteers, among other professions.

In NSW particularly, updated laws were introduced in 2013 mandating that anyone working or volunteering with children had to have a Working With Children.

The ID checks and application processed is managed by the RTA and was implemented to address gaps in who was able to access children.

Leah Bromfield, Deputy Director of the Australian Centre for Child Protection, said that parents should have the right to assume that this minimum standard has been met for every person who dons a Santa suit.

'Typically, at a minimum a National Police Records or 'Working With Children Check' will be required to ensure that people working or volunteering with children do not have prior convictions that would make them a risk to children's safety,' she said. 

'Child protection don't need to get involved, it's up to parents to decide what is best for their child. Parent's need to be able to make decisions, and choices are being taken away in a lot of different situations,' said Charmaine.

'Ozzie Santa', from Singing Telegrams, said that children are never forced to sit on his lap

'I actually want my daughter to sit on Santa's lap, but she doesn't like Santa and that doesn't bother us. If children start crying, the helpers sympathise, they don't force the issue,' she said.

'The whole experience is already very varied, and it's been like this for generations. I went and asked other parents and they all felt the same way I did.' 

In April this year, a 77-year-old man from Adelaide was charged with five aggravated accounts of indecent assault for abusing five girls while he worked as a shopping mall Santa in 2012.

William John Graham Webster worked at Southgate Plaza in Morphett Vale and Kalara Reserve in Davoren Park where the prosecution alleges he used his position as 'Santa' to assault the girls.

Mr Webter's legal council said that the evidence did not 'make sense' because several parents did not intervene to stop the alleged abuse while it was happening in front of them, reported Adelaide Now. 

'It just does not make sense that a mother would sit around and watch a person fiddle with their daughter’s vagina for five minutes and not do anything,' said Heath Barclay.

'The risk would be of inappropriate touching of the child, which would need to occur in the brief time the child was on "Santa's" lap for the photo, under the observation of the parent, with the potential to be caught on film, and with the potential for the child to speak out,' said Ms Bromfield.

'We know from the work of researchers like Professor Stephen Smallbone that child sex offending is often opportunistic and perpetrators will choose circumstances in which the chance of detection is low,'

'Theoretically, the Santa photo would seem to me to be a low-risk scenario, largely due to the heightened risk for detection.'

Charmaine said that parents were observant and looking after their kids while the photo was being taken.

'We need to stop bubble wrapping kids, we're not stupid. We know what's right and wrong,' she said. 

'I do wonder about the legal stance of dictating what people can and cannot do with their own children, and I'm incredulous as to what some people say in the modern world,' 'Santa' said.

'Having said that, most kids sit on my knee. The only people who actually sit on my lap are office workers at Christmas parties.'

All Santa's are checked for criminal backgrounds, and laws introduced in 2013 brought in even more thorough regulations for anyone working with minors
