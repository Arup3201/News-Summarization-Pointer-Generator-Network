Britain is working with the US on a dramatic rescue mission to save tens of thousands of trapped Yazidi refugees in northern Iraq, it emerged tonight.

Ministers are ‘hardening up’ plans to evacuate desperate families who have fled rampaging Islamic State forces massacring non-Muslims.

Government sources told MailOnline they were putting a plan together to get people off Mount Sinjar, amid growing alarm over the safety of up to a quarter of a million people trapped in the area.

‘We are working as fast as we can. It’s clearly a complicated operation, but plans are firming up’ a source said. The operation – if it is given the go ahead – will be led by the US with close co-operation with forces in Turkey and Kurdish Iraq.

The revelation - which came after the Government announced it was sending Chinook military helicopters to the region - will increase calls for Parliament to be recalled to give MPs a say on the UK's role in escalating humanitarian catastrophe.

Ministers insist any action under discussion is purely humanitarian and does not merit the recall of Parliament from its summer recess.

A Number 10 spokesperson said: ‘Our focus remains the humanitarian situation, particularly those trapped on Mount Sinjar.

‘As part of our efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering in Iraq, we are sending a small number of Chinook helicopters to the region for use if we decide we need further humanitarian relief options.

‘Meanwhile urgent planning to get those trapped on the mountainside to safety will continue in the coming days between ourselves and US, the Kurdish authorities and other partners.’

Number 10 also revealed the Government had agreed to transport some critical military supplies for Kurdish forces to fight Islamic State fighters. 

The developments tonight expose the Government's rapidly developing response to the sweeping advance of Islamist extremist threatening to massacre thousands of non-Muslims.

Chinook helicopters, which could be used to rescue Yazidi refugees trapped on Mount Sinjar after fleeing rampaging Islamic State fighters, would join two RAF C130 Hercules planes already carrying out aid drops.

A squadron of up to six or eight Tornado jets are also understood to be on their way to the region  amid growing alarm over the plight of up to a quarter of a million people trapped in northern Iraq.

The proposal to send the Chinook helicopters was being discussed in a meeting of Government’s emergency Cobra committee this afternoon.

The meeting was chaired by the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, with David Cameron still on holiday in Portugal and the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg with his family in Spain.

Defence sources said the helicopters could be sent to the region in case they were needed at short notice.

The RAF Hercules and Tornado aircraft are flying aid missions from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, but the Chinooks may need to operate from a much closer base.

Up to a quarter of a million people have fled the advances of Islamic State fighters who crossed the border from Syria to create an Islamic ‘Caliphate’ stretching across the region.

Iraqi Christians and members of the Yazidi sect have been given an ultimatum to convert to Islam or die. 

Reports have claimed many victims have been beheaded – with women and children even being buried alive. 

An RAF Hercules delivered emergency aid air to the people in Northern Iraq overnight after having to abort a mission on Saturday because there were too many refugees crowding the plane

Tens of thousands of refugees are trapped in desert with no food, water or shelter.

Growing alarm in the UK over the humanitarian crisis unfolding has increased pressure on the Prime Minister to return from his holidays to get a grip on the Government’s response.

RAF Tornado jets left the UK for Cyprus this afternoon, from where they are set to help efforts to deliver aid to the fleeing refugees.

Three aircraft left shortly after 2pm and will carry out surveillance ahead of airdrops to refugees from Hercules aircraft.

The MoD has stressed the jets would be taking on a humanitarian role and helping to identify safe areas on the ground on Mount Sinjar for supplies to be dropped.

The Tornados have been equipped with reconnaissance pods, which will be used to carry out surveillance to help the RAF C-130 Hercules cargo planes target where humanitarian supplies should be dropped.

The Ministry of Defence said the RAF cargo planes dropped a further two consignments of aid overnight, following a successful drop on Saturday.

A total of three air drops have been carried out - one on Saturday and two last night - following the aborted attempt in the early hours of yesterday morning.

British forces have dropped three rounds of aid to thousands of people trapped on Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq

The Department for International Development said latest drops included 3,180 reusable water purification containers filled with 15,900 litres of clean water and 816 solar lamps that can also be used to charge mobile phones.

And Downing Street has indicated that the Government is also looking at how it can play a role in getting equipment to Kurdish forces so they are better able to counter IS, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis).

But voices continued to be raised in favour of a more direct military intervention - and for MPs to be recalled from their summer break to debate and vote on it.

Tory MP Mark Pritchard became the latest to join politicians and former military chiefs in urging a stronger response, including targeted air strikes and drone attacks - but falling short of sending ground forces back to the country.

He predicted a recalled Commons would vote in favour of the escalation.

It comes as former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell has added his voice to mounting calls for Parliament to reconvene to discuss Britain's response.

‘The government would be well advised to recall Parliament,’ he said, to share with MPs ‘everything that the government has done and - at the moment at least - is intending to do’.

The Islamic State, which has declared a caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria, has prompted tens of thousands of Yazidis and Christians to flee for their lives during their push to within a 30-minute drive of the Kurdish regional capital Arbil

Arriving before the Cobra meeting, Mr Hammond was asked by reporters if MPs should be recalled to Westminster, but replied: ‘Not for the moment, no.’

A poll released tonight showed British voters now support taking part in air strikes against Islamic State fighters sweeping through northern Iraq slaughtering non-Muslims.

The Government has refused to rule out joining a US military assault to protect civilians fleeing the jihadists - but has insisted its focus is on getting aid to refugees.

But a ComRes poll for ITV News has revealed support for UK troops to bomb the fanatics.

Some 45 per cent of Britons approve of the RAF taking part in air strikes – while 37 per cent disapprove.

Last August 50 per cent of the country was opposed to missile strikes on Syria – with just 25 per cent in support.
