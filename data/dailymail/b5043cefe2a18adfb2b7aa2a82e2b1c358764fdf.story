A card-playing pair of German doctors have attacked a ban for cheating with cough signals - saying one of them simply had asthma.

World champions Michael Elinescu and Entscho Wladow were condemned by the World Bridge Federation last month for a scam which closely resembled the 'coughing code' of infamous Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? winner Major Charles Ingram.

But gynaecologist Dr Wladow attacked the ban - which has rocked the sedate world of bridge - and insisted: 'I have asthma, so of course I cough a lot'.

Dr Wladow was speaking to German newspaper Der Spiegel after the pair were banned from playing as a team for life and as individuals for 10 years by the Disciplinary Commission of the World Bridge Federation.

He said the ban was 'an impudence', adding: 'In 10 years I could already be as dead as a mouse.'

He and GP Dr Elinescu, 61 - both of whom vehemently denied the claims from the start - are planning to challenge the ban, the newspaper reported.

The pair, known as the German Doctors, triumphed for Germany last September at the world bridge championships in Bali, Indonesia.

But suspicions were raised about their 
frequent coughing during matches by American player Eddie Wold, who made
 a complaint to the World Bridge Federation.

Hidden cameras were installed which led to a two-day disciplinary hearing last month in Dallas, Texas.

The doctors did not appear at the hearing, but sent a number of letters challenging its legitimacy.

The eyes of the bridge world were on the hearing as the panel heard evidence from opponents, CCTV footage and experts that the pair had coughed whenever they were weak in a certain suit.

'The evidence showed that there was a clear pattern in the way that Elinescu and Wladow communicated information to each other,' the panel's report said.

'On each and every occasion when one of them held a shortage in a suit, this was communicated by coughing. This coughing took place when it was that player's turn to bid.

'The number of coughs indicated in which suit there was a shortage. If there was no shortage there was no coughing.'

Partners in top-level bridge games, where pairs must work in isolation but also as a team, have footboards between them under their tables and are not allowed to look at each other, said Robb Gordon from the American Contract Bridge League.

And as Law 73B of 
the game states: 'The gravest possible offence is for a 
partnership to exchange information through prearranged methods of 
communication.'

The pair were stripped of their title and the world champions were named as the American runners-up instead.

They were also made to pay the costs of the hearing against them.

The case has striking similarities to that of 'Coughing Major' Charles Ingram who, in 2003, was found guilty of cheating in the TV game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?

He, his wife Diana and accomplice Tecwen Whittock were convicted of fraud after the pair communicated answers to him from the audience by coughing on national television.
