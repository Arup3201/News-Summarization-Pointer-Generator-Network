Apps may have already conquered earth, and now they are set to take on space as well.

NASA has unveiled a new project to create tiny, cheap satellites by using the innards of a mobile phone.

Called PhoneSat, it will use a specially modified Nexus S handset running Google's Android software.

PhoneSat is designed to send the 
cheapest and easiest-to-construct satellites into orbit while running on
Google's Android operating system.

'Out of the box smartphones already offer a wealth of capabilities needed for satellite systems, including fast processors, versatile operating systems, multiple miniature sensors, high-resolution cameras, GPS receivers, and several radios,' said NASA.

Under the program, the space agency will launch three smartphones into space, and take photos of the earth with its camera.

It will also publish the plans to allow anyone to create their own satellites.

Wired.com reported that the initial test - PhoneSat 1.0 - cost about $3,500 to construct and used a Nexus One smartphone.

PhoneSat 2.0 will involve a Nexus S phone.

NASA issued a challenge in April to find the person who can deliver the most effective application for the PhoneSat to use. 

While the app’s design will be mostly up to its creator, NASA insists that the app include a star tracker, fire locator, altitude determination app and a radiation monitor.

Also important to the agency is a 'single event upset (SEU) detector’ app, which would increase the PhoneSat’s reliability.

Three PhoneSat systems, will be sent into space by the Orbital Sciences Corporation’s Antares rocket later this year, according to NASA.

Each phone will be contained in CubeSat, a four-inch metal box that will protect the smartphone as it orbits in space.

However, the agency is also publishing the plans, and has already begun world on PhoneSat 3.0, which uses a foldable design and can link together dozens of satellites.

NASA has opted to use Google's software as it is more open and easier to customise.

The news came as Google attempted to 
ease the concerns of shareholders who fear that Apple may now target 
them after the success of a patent lawsuit against Samsung.

The
search engine giant issued a statement in the wake of the $1billion 
victory that Apple won from a California court, saying that the portions
of Samsung's smartphones which were found to be copied do not apply to 
their software.

If that is the case, then Apple will have no case against Google.

'The court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims. Most of these don't relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the U.S. Patent Office,' Google officials said in a statement on Monday.

Google provided their Android operating system to companies like Samsung for free, and allowed the companies themselves to make their own tweaks to the software.

Mission: The PhoneSat systems, three in total, will be sent into space by the Orbital Sciences Corporation¿s Antares rocket later this year, according to NASA
