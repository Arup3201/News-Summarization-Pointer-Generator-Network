A Florida man plunged to his death in a 30-foot fall from an attraction at a shopping mall Wednesday.

Horrified shoppers looked on, screaming, as Robert Belvoir, 52, of Lake Mary, fell to the concrete floor of the Artegon Marketplace in Orlando's Sky Trail ropes course. 

The course includes zip lines built along the roof of the mega-mall. Belvoir and a female relative of his decided to join other mall-goers on the Sky Trail course. 

Soon, what was supposed to be a fun Christmas Eve outing turned tragic.

A female relative of Belvoir's was reportedly with him and witnesses heard her bloodcurdling screams as she watched Belvoir plummet 30 feet from the top of the course.

'I think he had a family member that was actually there at the ride, and they must've just gotten off, and then he went on,' Lovetta Quinn-Henry, of the Orlando Police Department, told WESH.
