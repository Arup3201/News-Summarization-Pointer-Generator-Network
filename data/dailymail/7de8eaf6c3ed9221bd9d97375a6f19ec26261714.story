Just before last summer's World Cup I hosted a show alongside England manager Roy Hodgson. He took calls from England fans, and fair to say that show was more of a success for Roy than the tournament itself.

On Tuesday I will be on talkSPORT from 4pm until 7pm alongside a man who works with Roy, the Sky Sports expert and one of the most decorated players in the English game, Gary Neville.

If you haven’t got a question for GNev then you’re not a genuine football fan. You can send across your questions via Twitter, using the hashtag #askgnev.

We’ve met before and get on well, I’ve interviewed him several times too, but this is the first time he has come into the radio station to present a show with me. I can’t wait.

As with any other show we will be looking at the breaking news and issues of the day but there will be so much more.

I’ve got about a million questions to ask him on all sorts of subjects including Manchester United, what went wrong in Brazil, and how long he can continue combining coaching with punditry.

But what I’m really looking forward to are the questions from the listeners: there were some sharp and intelligent ones posed to Hodgson when he came in, I’m expecting the same for Neville from the amazing talkSPORT faithful.

So listen to the show and ask Neville that question you’ve always wanted to ask.

A mutual friend of ours told me last week that Neville is nervous about working with me. No need to be Gary, although we may have one or two surprises planned for you.
