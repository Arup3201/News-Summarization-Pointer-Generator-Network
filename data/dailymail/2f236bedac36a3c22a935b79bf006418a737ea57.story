Nigel Farage is certainly no shrinking violet.

And if these photos are anything to go by, neither is his mother.

Barbara Stevens, 74, is the rather game lady reclining in the roses and lazing by the lavender in a series of risque calendars to raise money for charity.

Spanner in the works: The Ukip leader's mother has appeared in a number of calendars for her local Women's Institute

On at least four occasions since 2005, the Ukip leader’s mother has posed in various states of undress on behalf of her local Women’s Institute. 

Coincidentally, she has chosen colour themes that cover the political spectrum. For her first calendar appearance in 2005, it was Lib Dem yellow, as she posed in nothing but a hard hat, pearls and heels behind a hydraulic machine.

In 2007 she was photographed with several well-placed pots of lavender – appropriately Ukip purple.

For her Miss July portrait in 2009, she was covered in pink body paint and clutched a bunch of Labour-red roses.

Two years later, having passed the age of 70, she struck a more modest pose on a Tory blue chaise longue – but was still naked beneath a profusion of feathers and net.

Today Miss Stevens, a former Conservative voter, says she is a fully paid-up Ukip member.

She said that she has no plans to pose naked again, adding: ‘I don’t think Nigel needs that sort of publicity to be honest.

‘But they were tastefully produced – we weren’t aiming for the top shelf.

‘We raised a net profit of £42,000 over the years, and it was a wonderful achievement.’

Blushing: Mr Farage did not comment on his mother's naked posing, but his spokesman said he was happy with her charity work

Mr Farage's half sister Melanie Thomas (pictured posing as Pocahontas in 2009), 43, does not shy away from nudity either

Miss Stevens' daughter Melanie,  Mr Farage's half-sister, appeared three times. In 2007 she laid back on a bench and stroked a cat

Miss Stevens admitted her son, Mr Farage, 50, and his brother Andrew, 48, were not entirely delighted about her readiness to get her kit off.

‘My sons wonder what their mother is going to get up to next,’ she said.

Her escapades began ten years ago when she asked neighbours to join her ‘Downe Dames’ calendar group, named after the village of Downe near Orpington, South-East London, where she brought up her sons after divorcing their father. She also has two other children from her second marriage. 

Miss Stevens, who uses her maiden name, is a regular speaker at WI events, where her calendars are a favourite topic.

Mr Farage’s half-sister is no wallflower either. Barbara Stevens’s daughter Melanie Thomas, 43, portrayed American Indian immigrant Pocahontas in 2009 

Asked about his mother’s nude modelling, Mr Farage last night said: ‘I’m going to make no comment about it myself.’ 

But a spokesman for Mr Farage said: ‘Nigel is very happy with how much money his mother raises for charity.’
