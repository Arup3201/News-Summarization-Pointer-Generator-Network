A three-year-old boy with cancer received a special surprise on Sunday when the mariachis at a restaurant he frequently visited made him an honorary member of their band.

Renvek Larson from Sutton, Alaska, suffers from ganglioneuroblastoma - a rare form of cancer that affects children - and was on one of his regular trips to receive treatment in Portland, Oregon, when he and his family stopped at Raul's Family Mexican Restaurant.

The band, who had seen that Renvek always danced and smiled when they played their music, presented him with a sombrero, vest, boots and mini guitar, and invited him to play along with them.

Biggest fan: Three-year-old Renvek Larson from Sutton, Alaska, was happily surprised on Sunday when his favorite mariachi band presented him with his own costume and instruments

Honorary member: The six-piece band, who saw that Renvek always danced and smiled when they played their music, decided to surprise him on his Sunday visit to the Mexican restaurant where they perform

Renvek was overjoyed, and he strummed on his child-sized guitar as the band played another song.

The surprise was organized by Eileen Carner, a videographer for Mariachi Portland who said she was enchanted by the boy when she saw him for the first time weeks earlier.

'He was trying to imitate their foot movements and everything,' Mrs Carner told OregonLive.com of his regular visits to the restaurant. 'The guys were kind of captivated by him.'

So she and the six-piece band all decided to prepare something special for the next time Renvek came to visit them.

Brave: Renvek suffers from ganglioneuroblastoma - a rare cancer that affects five out of every million children each year - and he has to regularly receive treatment in Portland, Oregon, where the mariachi band is based

They set out in search of a mini mariachi costume for the boy, so he could feel like part of the band.

After a few weeks, they had collected boots, pantalons, a belt, a hat, three maracas and a small guitar - some of which had been given to them for free once people heard about Renvek.

'He captures anybody who reads [his story] and looks at him,' explained the videographer, who found out more about Renvek by looking at a Facebook page dedicated to updating others about his condition.

The website features pictures of Renvek and his family, details about his treatments and how he is feeling, and events to raise money for him.

According to the National Institutes of Health, Renvek's rare condition affects fewer than five in a million children every year.
