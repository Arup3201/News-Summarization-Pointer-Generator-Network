A hair-raising four-minute computer animation reveals what it will be like to descend 570 feet at speeds of up to 65pmh from the top of the world's largest rollercoaster.

Until the aptly named 'Skyscraper' opens in 2017, thrill seekers will have to settle for the video.

Released by US Thrill Rides, the company behind Skyscraper, the clip shows the Orlando rollercoaster in all its glory.

The world's tallest rollercoaster is set to open in Orlando, Florida, in 2017 - and thrill-seekers are in for a treat with this towering metal monster named Skyscraper

Tumbling and twisting at speeds of up to 65mph, this is one rollercoaster that is not for the fainthearted

The video shows the ride taking off from inside the Skyplex entertainment complex and climbing skyward through twists and turns until it reaches its incredible 570-foot peak.

The simulation then shows the cars drop, dip and dive down the track, which is spiraled around the tower overlooking Orlando.

'Skyscraper will not only take riders higher than ever before, but also introduce one thrill right after the next - there's no 'down time' on this four-minute coaster experience,' Bill Kitchen, founder of US Thrill Rides told the Orlando Sentinel. 

'It is an absolute cutting-edge engineering marvel that will deliver pure adrenaline unlike any roller coaster in the world today.'

The  rollercoaster, which will be the centre of the new $200 million Skyplex entertainment complex, is not only designed to be the tallest in the world, but the most thrilling too.

'The unique design of the coaster means more incredible, heart-pounding inside and outside loops, dives, spirals and inversions in a vertical area than riders have ever before experienced,' Mr Kitchen added.

For those who aren't sure they can stomach the twists and turns of the rollercoaster, there will also be a look-out point 535ft above ground, accessible by glass elevators and offering panoramic views of Orlando.

And next door to the rollercoaster, the 420ft Orlando Eye Ferris wheel will offer another sedate lookout option. 

The towering roller coaster will not be housed in any of Orlando's most famous theme parks - instead it will be the star attraction at the city's International Drive, which is an area normally reserved for hotels and eateries.

International Drive's new $200 million, 495,000-square-foot Skyplex entertainment complex will begin construction in 2015 and is set to feature simulators, shops rock climbing, bars and restaurants.
