This is a unique glimpse into the heart-warming relationship between a couple and their clan of movie-star grizzly bears.

While other pet owners are walking the dog or laying out cat food, Doug and Lynne Seus are rolling around their Utah ranch with three 650kg beasts.

Or preparing them for their next blockbuster.

Star: Bart 2's numerous talents have landed him roles in movies like Evan Almighty and Dr Doolittle 2

As professional bear trainers, the couple have worked for four decades providing towering beasts for shows like Game Of Thrones and films like Legends Of The Fall.

They started in 1973 with Bart The Bear, a 9ft Alaskan, who counted Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt among his co-stars.

He also presented an Oscar with Mike Myers in 1998.

Now, 40 years later, after Bart The Bear died of cancer in 2000, they have continued the legacy with brother and sister Bart The Bear 2 and Honey Bump, as well as Tank.

Their filmography is extensive, and their work tireless.

Tank, a 7'2" Brown Bear who starred as Archie in Dr Doolittle 2, works daily on his moves to be able to do things like 'wave bye-bye' and do yoga.

Honey Bump, a 6'4" Alaskan Bear, made her name in Evan Almighty with Jim Carey, and can do ballet gymnastics.

Her brother Bart 2, who towers over the rest at 8'6", recently starred in the hit HBO series Game of Thrones.

The clan are also ambassadors for Doug and Lynne's charity Vital Ground, which helps protect wildlife

Danger? Most people would be fearful of giant claws near their throat, but Doug is happy to roll around

And behind the scenes, an unusual, loving relationship has grown between the humans and the powerful animals.

Their ease around humans means they have been able to live side-by-side with the Seus's all their life, cuddling and playing all day long.

The bears are also ambassadors for Doug and Lynne's charity, Vital Ground, which helps to protect key landscapes used by grizzly bears and other wide-ranging wildlife.
