Ben Amos has confirmed he expects to leave Manchester United this summer.

The 24-year-old goalkeeper is on loan at Championship side Bolton but out of contract at Old Trafford at the end of the season.

Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Amos has made six appearances on loan at Bolton

He said: 'Being a United fan, I’ve always believed I can play for Manchester United and always aspired to be a Manchester United player.

'Pre-season, I was told I was number two. With the cup games, if I'd got a sniff of that, that would have made it worthwhile sticking around for.

'As soon as Victor Valdes was brought in, I was essentially demoted to fourth really - you've got to move on.

'Being 24, I can leave on a Bosman so that gives me a little bit more flexibility of where I can go. I'll assess the options in the summer, see what is about and see what the best thing for me is. 

Sir Alex Ferguson handed Amos his first team debut in a League Cup tie against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford in 2008.

He played against Valencia in the Champions League and made his top flight bow in a 2-0 home win against Stoke in 2012.

Amos has made six appearances for Bolton after replacing injured Andy Lonergan against Nottingham Forest.
