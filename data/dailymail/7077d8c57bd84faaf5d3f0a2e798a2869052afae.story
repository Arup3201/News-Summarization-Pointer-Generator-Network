As the nation reflects on the centenary of the start of First World War tomorrow, there is one name that will be forever  associated with the early part of the conflict that shaped Europe's path - John Parr.

The teenager was the first British soldier to die in the war, which would end up taking the lives of almost a million more of his countrymen before it ended in 1918.

Tomorrow, his grave at St Symphorien military cemetery in Belgium will be visited by Prime Minister David Cameron, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge for a special ceremony.

Private John Parr, 17, set off on his reconnaissance bike on the lookout for German troops amid the rolling farmland and woods south of Brussels in August 1914. It was the last anyone saw of him.

The grave of Private John Parr, the first British soldier to be killed in action on the Western Front. He was just 17. Right, Iris Hunt, his great-niece, will pay her respects tomorrow

No pictures of him exist, and little is known about his short yet significant life.

Parr was born on July 19 1897 and grew up in poverty with 11 siblings - five of whom died before they turned four - in Finchley, north London.

His father was a milkman and his mother did laundry for wealthier families and also acted as a midwife.

The teenager was a butcher's boy and a golf caddie before lying about his age and joining the 4th Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment when he was 14.

During tomorrow's ceremony Iris Hunt, one of Parr’s great-nieces, will stand by his headstone to read a letter sent by the teenager's mother, Alice, in a desperate bid for information about her son.

The 75-year-old treasures a photograph from the 1940s of herself, aged about two-and-a-half, holding her great-grandmother's hand.

She told the Sunday Telegraph: 'In that picture, I am holding her hand. So I feel that I am guiding her back to where her son was.

'He was a young lad, so perhaps it was a simple adventure, not knowing what he was getting himself into. It would have been quite exciting.'

Mystery surrounds the circumstances of Parr's death. Military experts suggested his death may been an accident at the hands of his French and Belgian allies.

On the night he died, Private Parr is believed to have been at least 10 miles away from members of the German cavalry.

Jon Cooksey, a military author, told The Sunday Times: 'There was no German soldier around to shoot at him. John Parr must have died either as a result of friendly fire or an accident.'

He said opposition troops would have rushed to take credit for the death, because of their eagerness to be commended and praised for their actions. 

Prime Minister David Cameron is urging Britons to switch off their lights for an hour tomorrow evening to mark the 100th anniversary of Britain’s declaration of war on Germany in 1914.

The Lights Out initiative will be the culmination of a day of commemorative events across the country and in Europe, with members of the Royal Family fully involved at home and abroad.

Millions of homes, offices and public and private buildings, such as Tower Bridge and 10 Downing Street, will be included in the ‘shared moment of reflection’ between 10pm and 11pm, leaving just a single candle or bulb illuminating a window as a symbol of ‘continuing hope in the darkness’.

Parr was last seen on the night of August 21, three weeks after war had been declared, when he was sent out to look for missing platoons.

Mr Cooksey, who studies German troop patterns, added: 'No contact with the British Expeditionary Force near Mons had been reported that day.'

Meanwhile King Philippe of Belgium attended Thimister Cemetery in the country's Walloon region today. He paid tribute to the monument of Cavalier Fonk, the first Belgian soldier to fall in the war.

The last British soldier killed in action was Private George Ellison. He was shot at Mons, just before the official ceasefire at 11am on November 11, 1918.
