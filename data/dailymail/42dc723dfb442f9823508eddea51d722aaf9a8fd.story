Farmers are calling for cavolo nero to be rebranded as 'black kale' in a bid to boost sales.

Something posh, something Italian, a type of cheese... all answers given when UK shoppers were asked what cavolo nero is.

It is, in fact, a type of dark kale. I'm sure you know that. 

But 60 per cent of people asked didn't, and poor cavolo nero is feeling left out as we all go crazy for blending bunches and bunches of the green stuff.

Originally from Tuscany, the black leafy veg is now grown in the UK too and farmers are calling for a name change to 'Black Kale' to help bump up its popularity to superfood superhero. 

It tastes a little sweeter but is still a good source of lutein, vitamins K, A and C as well as significant amounts of manganese, copper, fibre, calcium, iron and the B vitamins.

Kale website Discover Kale (yes, this exists, and it's actually pretty good, um, if you're a kale fan) explains: 

'Cavolo nero is a close cousin to kale, which means it has the same nutritional profile and like its British counterpart, it is really versatile, easy to use and great value. 

From the research it seems though that the Italian name is sending the wrong message to our customers, who are confused as to what exactly cavolo nero is and are perhaps failing to appreciate that it is now grown in the UK. 

By renaming cavolo nero black kale, we are making it really clear that it shares the benefits of kale and we hope that this will encourage consumers to try this brilliant home-grown brassica.'

OK then... time to stick it in a smoothie:

Prep time: 5 minutes

Serves 1 

Place all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and blitz until smooth.

Or for a creamier drink try replacing the pineapple with banana and add some mint.
