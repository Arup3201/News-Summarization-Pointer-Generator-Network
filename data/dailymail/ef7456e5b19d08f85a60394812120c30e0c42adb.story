The follicly challenged can now regain a full head of hair in a day thanks to the world's fastest hair transplant. Scott McCrum went baldly into the record books this week - after undergoing the procedure in just 16 hours.

Scott followed in the footsteps of football superstar Wayne Rooney and Scots millionaire Duncan Bannatyne to have the Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) treatment.

But unlike the celebrities, who underwent the process over a period of up to three days, Scott, 30, had the hair transplanted in one single operation.

The surgery works by removing thousands of individual hair follicles from the back of the head, where hair is usually thicker.

The surgeon then uses very small micro blades or fine needles to puncture sites for receiving the grafts. Placing them in a realistic pattern.

The healthy hairs are then 're-planted' them into thinning patches.

The patient is awake during the procedure, having received a local anaesthetic. 

After the operation the hair will start to gradually grow and the full results will be seen in eight to 12 months.

He spent £12,500 for the op and had the FUE at The Glasgow Clinic for the FUE which involved 2,684 grafts.

The
 operation was a success and Scott, from Alloway, Ayrshire, who began to
 lose his hair in his early 20s, is looking forward to combing the 
results.

Scott said: 'I’m a pretty confident guy but I found I was beginning to get self-conscious about it.

'It began to go at the front so I used to have expensive hairstyles to try to cover it but then it started going at the crown so I admitted defeat and shaved it off, but I prefer the way I look with hair.

'The operation wasn’t so bad. It hurt a little but I just watched a film and let them get on with it.

'It feels good now and I am looking forward to it growing in and seeing the results.

'I didn’t set out to be the first in Scotland but it feels great that I am, and hopefully this type of surgery will be available to the wider public in the future.'

Scott began to research having the surgery earlier this year after becoming fed up of his receding hair line.

His surgery started at 7.30am and Scott didn’t leave the operating table until 12.30am the following morning.

The surgery works by removing individual follicles at random from the back of the head, where hair is usually thicker, and transplanting them into thinning patches.

The operation is normally done over two to three days but Scott’s surgeons decided to complete the procedure in just one day, setting a new world record for speed.

Scott’s hair will take at least three months to grow in but he said he is delighted with the results so far.

The Glasgow Clinic was set up by businessman Fraser Christensen, who launched the business in Scotland after having the operation himself.

The operation, which was only available in London and abroad until now, was carried out by Dr Emorane Lupanzula.

He said: 'It’s been an extremely successful operation and we’re delighted to be the first to have carried this out in Scotland.

'Our qualified and experience team have really set the bench mark high with this surgery in terms of achievement and results across the hair transplant world.

The operation is similar to one undertaken by Wayne Rooney - but over several days.

'Our aim is to change the perception of hair transplantation and educate those seeking a solution.

'In Scotland and across the whole of the UK we need to create an awareness of the FUE procedure.

'It’s a revolutionary technique that is so advanced it has taken hair transplantation to a completely new level.

'Opening a clinic in Glasgow gives UK patients an alternative to travelling abroad for FUE treatment and having to wait on long surgery lists.'
