Improper treatment: Doctors are reported to have been shocked at the lack of motherly attention shown to baby Stella and a prison source said medical staff were appalled at the baby's dirty condition 

'The mother appears not to have been washing her properly, if at all, ' the source told Dailymail.com exclusively. 

It is understood there are concerns that because the baby has not been kept clean the area where the umbilical cord was cut might become infected.

'The baby's high fever is more of a concern than the jaundice,' said the source. 

Miss Mack, 19, obtained permission from the Bali Prosecutor’s office to return, under guard, to the Sanglah Hospital - where she gave birth to Stella Schaefer last week - after pleading for the baby to receive ‘proper hospital treatment’. 

After baby Stella developed a high fever and her skin took on a yellowish colour - an indication of jaundice - the child was taken on Wednesday to the clinic inside the walls of Kerobokan prison.

With Miss Mack and her co-accused boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer - the baby’s father - looking on, clinic staff treated the baby with medicines, but her condition did not improve.

Throughout Thursday, Miss Mack pleaded to be allowed to return to hospital with the baby, but she was told this would not be allowed until the Prosecutor’s office gave permission.

She had to wait a further 24 hours before that permission was given - and today Miss Mack was helped into an ambulance with the baby and taken to the hospital.

Jaundice in new-born babies is most commonly caused by immature livers being unable to remove bilirubin from the blood.

Baby Stella was born several weeks early in a caesarian operation and medical experts say early births can result in jaundice, which will eventually go away.

But prison sources said today that while this was explained to Miss Mack, she is understood to have been concerned about the baby’s high temperature.

She is also understood to be under pressure from her boyfriend’s mother, Ms Kia Walker, to make arrangements for the baby to be taken away from the prison cell and raised in a healthier environment.

It is not known whether Ms Walker has offered to take care of her grand-daughter, but Miss Mack made it clear before the baby’s birth that she intended to keep her daughter with her for the permitted period of two years, should she still be in prison during that period.

She and Tommy Schaefer, 21, are facing separate trials for the same crime - the murder of Ms Mack’s 62-year-old socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack, who was murdered in a Bali hotel room last year.

The prosecution alleges that Schaefer killed Mrs Wiese-Mack by battering her about the head and face with the metal handle from a heavy fruit bowl, after which Miss Mack helped him to force the body into a suitcase which was then loaded into the boot of a waiting taxi.

The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit.

They tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel - and Mrs Mack was allegedly the only person who had permission to open the box.

Miss Mack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel.
