It's often said that politicians are all mouth and no trousers. But eyebrows were raised when Labour MP Ben Bradshaw turned up in cycling shorts for a grand political event.

Mr Bradshaw, 52, had arrived late for the champagne reception given by former Foreign Secretary Mr Miliband before he moved to the US.

Guests were shocked by  the skin-tight shorts, with one describing them as ‘bordering on the obscene’.

But the former Culture Secretary hit back at claims that his attire for David Miliband’s London farewell party was ‘disgraceful’ – saying it’s simply what he usually wears on the party circuit.

Dignitaries at West End restaurant Ozer last Tuesday included former Chancellor Alistair Darling and ex-Home Secretaries Alan Johnson and John Reid.

A party-goer said: ‘It was a disgraceful way to dress to any function – let alone one intended to pay homage to David’s many achievements in the Labour party and the country.

What was Bradshaw thinking?’ Exeter MP Mr Bradshaw said he had already attended two other receptions that night and Mr Miliband’s was his last.

He said: ‘I was dashing between events on my bike as it is the best way to get around London in a hurry.

‘Obviously I was not going to be cycling in a suit in this weather. David’s party was not all that formal and he is used to me turning up for things wearing them.’ 

Mr Miliband will live in New York as he takes command of the charity International Rescue Committee.
