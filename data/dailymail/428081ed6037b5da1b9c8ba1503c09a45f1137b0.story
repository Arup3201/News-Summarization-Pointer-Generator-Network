Wikileaks founder Julian Assange walked into the Knightsbridge embassy to claim asylum

Ecuador's President said today the 
South American nation would have to consider 'whether Julian Assange's life is at 
stake', with a decision on his asylum claim expected to be made later 
today.

The Wikileaks founder spent a second night at the Ecuadorian Embassy last night, after making a last-ditch plea for political asylum.

Mr Assange, 40, is attempting to evade extradition to Sweden, where he faces sex attack allegations, and walked into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London two nights ago, claiming political asylum and citing his human rights.

President Rafael Correa told BBC Mundo the country 'defends the right to live'.

President Correa also said: 'We are analysing Julian Assange's asylum request in a very serious and responsible way. We can't give an official response until the analysis of his request is complete.'

A police source today confirmed Assange will be arrested if he leaves the Ecuadorian Embassy.

There are currently no arrangements in place to provide him with safe passage out of the UK should he be granted asylum by the South American country.

President Correa told Venezuela's Telesur TV network in Rio de Janeiro: 'He wants to continue his mission in a country, and I cite it textually because the sentence impressed me a lot, that he wants to continue his mission of free expression without limits, to reveal the truth, in a place of peace dedicated to truth and justice.'

Meanwhile, Assange's celebrity backers faced an embarrassing £240,000 financial headache following his bid to avoid extradition to Sweden over alleged sex attacks.

The WikiLeaks founder walked into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London claiming political asylum and citing his human rights.

But Scotland Yard said he faced arrest for breaching his bail conditions – while a list of high-profile supporters, led by socialite Jemima Khan, risk losing tens of thousands of pounds they put up to keep him out of jail.

The desperate move by Mr Assange, 40, stunned Miss Khan, who confirmed she was one of those who put up the cash for him.

Asked on Twitter whether she was 'on the hook' for his breach of bail, she replied: 'Yes. I had expected him to face the allegations. I am as surprised as anyone by this.'

Bianca Jagger, film-makers Michael Moore and Ken Loach, and journalists John Pilger and Tariq Ali were among those who offered to support Mr Assange's bail while he fought a legal battle to avoid being sent to Sweden, where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in 2010.

Among those believed to have been accepted as guarantors are journalist Phillip Knightley, magazine publisher Felix Dennis, Nobel Prize winner Sir John Sulston and Labour peer Lord Evans of Temple Guiting.

Miss Jagger said on Twitter: 'I would like to set the record straight. I didn't post bail for Julian Assange.'

Film director Ken Loach and socialite Jemima 
Khan are just two of the celebrity backers who are believed to have put 
up £20,000 each so that Julian Assange could keep his freedom in 
December 2010

Those who did stand surety for Mr Assange – freed on bail in December 2010 after spending nine days in Wandsworth jail when held under a European arrest warrant issued by the Swedes – risked losing their money the minute he walked into the Knightsbridge embassy, just yards from Harrods, on Thursday evening.

Embassies are regarded as 'safe havens' which British police cannot enter. While Mr Assange remains inside the building he is safe from arrest – and extradition.

He requested political asylum under the UN Human Rights Declaration, ironic given Ecuador's poor record on human rights and free speech.

But Mr Assange is friendly with the 
South American country's socialist leader Rafael Correa.

Last month the 
Australian interviewed him for his new TV series The World Tomorrow, 
broadcast on the Russian state-sponsored Today TV channel, in which the 
president – who has clashed with Washington – praised WikiLeaks and the 
two men laughed and joked.

The dramatic move to seek refuge 
inside the embassy came days after the Supreme Court rejected Mr 
Assange's appeal against extradition. He was expected to be sent to 
Sweden within a fortnight.

He denies the Swedish allegations but 
fears it may lead to him being sent to the US to face charges over his 
whistle-blowing website, for which he could face the death penalty for 
espionage.

The Metropolitan Police said it had 
been told at 10.20pm on Tuesday that Mr Assange had breached a bail 
condition, that he stay at a specific address between 10pm and 8am.

'He is now subject to arrest under the
 Bail Act for breach of these conditions,' a spokesman said. 'Officers 
are aware of his location at the Ecuador Embassy.'

Mr Assange's friend Gavin Macfadyen, 
from the Centre for Investigative Journalism at City University, emerged
 from the embassy at lunchtime.

He said: 'He is in very good humour and 
grateful for the hospitality of the embassy. He is meeting with the 
lawyers now to discuss all of it.'   

Ecuador has already said it is 
seeking the views of the UK, Swedish and US governments before deciding 
on the asylum application.

If they decide not to hand Mr Assange 
back there will be a messy diplomatic spat, with Britain and Washington 
putting pressure on the Ecuador government and stressing there is no 
humanitarian or legal reason for keeping him inside the embassy.

÷ Corruption, inefficiency and political influence have plagued the Ecuadorian judiciary for many years.

÷ In a referendum held in 2011, President Rafael Correa obtained a mandate for constitutional reforms that would significantly increase government powers to constrain media and influence the appointment and dismissal of judges.

÷ Ecuador's laws restrict freedom of expression, and government officials, including Correa, use these laws against critics. Those involved in protests marred by violence may be prosecuted on inflated 'terrorism' charges.

÷ Police often attribute murders to a 'settling of accounts' between criminal gangs, with prosecutions and convictions rare.

÷  in April 2010 a gang of hitmen composed of active-duty police was exposed. It was claimed that the officers involved were part of a 'social cleansing group' that killed delinquents in Quevedo, Los Rios Province.

÷ The majority of child workers in the banana industry quit school before the age of 15 and are often forced to work gruelling hours for little pay. Some children work 12-hour shifts in hazardous conditions, experience sexual harassment and little in the way of sanitation.

÷ The country's security forces have been accused of using excessive force, sometimes with impunity amid claims of isolated unlawful killings.

÷ Social problems include aggression against journalists; violence against women; discrimination against ethnic and gay groups; people trafficking; sexual exploitation of minors and child labour.

÷ Vigilante justice remains a problem. Such violence occurs particularly in indigenous communities and poor neighborhoods of major cities.

÷ While the constitution and laws prohibit torture and similar forms of intimidation, some police officers have reportedly tortured and abused suspects and prisoners.

÷ From 2007 through to August 2010, the National Police held 503 disciplinary tribunals for abuses committed by police. As a result, 367 police officers were dismissed, 171 were arrested and 68 were sanctioned.

÷ Prisons and detention centres are overcrowded by 93 per cent. As a result a number of prisons experienced serious outbreaks of disease.
