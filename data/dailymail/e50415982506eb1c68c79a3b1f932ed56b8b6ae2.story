A haul of sketches and paintings by one of the world's most prolific art forgers - whose work was described as often more beautiful than the original - has been put up for sale.

Eric Hebborn duped art dealers and galleries world-wide with his paintings in the style of Renaissance greats such Rubens, Van Dyck, Corot and Michelangelo. 

His work was so convincing that dealers sold them on as genuine originals, and much of his undetected work still hangs in galleries and museums around the world.

After he was murdered in 1996 his sister retrieved all of the work left in his studio, including scores of 'doodles' or preparatory drawings in ink, crayon and watercolours which appear to show Hebborn practicing imitating the old masters' hand.

Now, 236 drawings are being sold in individual lots, ranging in price from £100 to £500 each by Webbs of Wilton auctioneers in Wiltshire.

In one sketch, the master forger has almost exactly copied Michelangelo's Prophet Jeremiah.

Other drawings are in Renaissance style but not specific to a particular artist.

Hebborn was never prosecuted by police for fraud. He was murdered after being beaten about the head with a blunt instrument by a mystery attacker in Italy in 1996.

Auctioneer Simon Wingett said: 'Eric Hebborn was probably the world's best ever art forger - he was as good as it got when it came to drawing.

'He created his own pictures in the style of the old masters.'

Hebborn, from London, maintained he never tried to convince people his works were originals but he also never signed them and was happy to let art dealers believe that they were by old masters.

Lot 244, a water sketch of two figures based on Michelangelo.  Hebborn created around 1,000 drawings and paintings in the style of Renaissance greats such Rubens, Van Dyck, Corot and Castiglione

Lot 365, an ink and wash sketch of two figures wrestling an animal to the ground. His work was so convincing that dealers sold them on as genuine originals

Beneath one of the drawings in the style of landscape and portrait painter Jean-Baptiste Corot, he wrote: 'Only the experts are worth fooling, the greater the expert the greater the satisfaction of deceiving them.'

Mr Wingett said: 'He never really set out to deceive but was led down that path by dealers who wanted to make whatever they could out of him. 

'They were happy to believe they were originals as were the museums they sold them to.

'Some rather famous names in the art world were involved and some rather famous museums all over the world that have Hebborns in them without realising.

'Even if they had their suspicions they are never going to want to be proved wrong because of their reputation.

Lot 369, a pencil sketch of Daniel in the Lion's Den. Hebborn's drawings are being sold in individual lots, ranging in price from £100 to £500 each by Webbs of Wilton auctioneers in Wiltshire

Lot 366, a pencil and wash sketch of two prostrate figures. Much of his undetected work still hangs in galleries and museums around the world.

A watercolour of a coastal scene and wrecked wooden fishing boat, signed in pencil by Hebborn. He studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in the 1950s and turned to forgery after critics failed to appreciate his own work

'His was the highest quality work. These drawings were part of his loose works or doodles of his. Some of them are preparatory drawings for bigger work, such as a finished oil paintings that may be hanging in a museum somewhere.'

Hebborn studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in the 1950s and turned to forgery after critics failed to appreciate his own work.

His deception was revealed in 1978 when a curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, examined two drawings from an established dealer of old master work and noticed they had been executed on the same kind of paper

His deception was revealed in 1978 when a curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, US, examined two drawings from an established dealer of old master work and noticed they had been executed on the same kind of paper.

Hebborn confessed to making forged work in 1984 but insisted he had done nothing wrong and instead blamed the art dealers for allowing themselves to be deceived.

Mr Wingett added: 'These drawings provide a fascinating insight into somebody who made a lot of money for people and deceived some of the finest art institutions in the world.

'While many people would quite like to forget Eric Hebborn there is a new generation of art enthusiasts who don't know who he was and would be interested in these drawings.'

The sale takes place on October 22.
