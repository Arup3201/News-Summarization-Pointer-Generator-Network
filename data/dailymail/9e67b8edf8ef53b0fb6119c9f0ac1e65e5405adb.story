A two-year-old Ohio boy was so overwhelmed during a meeting with his heroes, he completely lost it during a moment that was captured in a priceless photo. 

Little Quincy Kroner didn't fall apart during a visit with Dora the Explorer or SpongeBob; it was two garbage men from Cincinnati that made him go to pieces.

The Cincinnati Public Services workers, Eddie Washington and Mark Davis, agreed to meet with Quincy last week as a special prize after he successfully completed potty training.

Cincinnati Public Services is working on a special recognition of Quincy and his friends but 'it has not been settled yet', according to a spokesperson 

Quincy also got a garbage truck he wanted to show the men. 

While a photo was being taken of Quincy and his heroes in front of their truck, 'he became undone'.

In a Facebook post of the photo, his dad Ollie Kroner wrote: 'Quincy's been waiting all week to show the garbage men his garbage truck. But, in the moment, he was overwhelmed in the presence of his heroes.'

Kroner said his son knows that Washington and Davis will be driving by every Friday, according to ABC News. 

Washington and Davis know that Quincy will be watching, so they honk, wave and 'put on a show' for him. 

Quincy's father said: 'From the moment he hears them from blocks away he runs to the window, climbs up on the couch and watches them.

'They've developed a kind of relationship through the window.'

Cincinnati Public Services told Daily Mail Online: 'These sanitation professionals are part of a new generation of Public Works employees who understand that their work is essential for the quality of life of our citizens.'

CPS is working on a special recognition of Quincy, Eddie an Mark, but 'it has not been settled yet'.
