A father was horrified after his daughters opened a Frozen karaoke machine and discovered a pill inside it. 

Samuel Wilkes Read gave the toy to daughters Isabella, six, and Lola, four, after his sister-in-law bought it for them in America. 

The 33-year-old from Cambridge was shocked when they opened the gift to find the small green and purple tablet inside.

Lola and Isabella thought the tablet (left) was 'a magic pill' when they found it in their Frozen karaoke machine

Mr Wilkes Read, an airline pilot, said if he hadn't been there to see them open the gift one of the girls would have swallowed the pill and become ill. 

'The girls were so excited to open the gift.

'They quickly said there was a magical pill at the bottom stuck in the sellotape and the plastic, it was a green and grey capsule and stood out quite a bit.

'I Googled what it was and it seems to be a diarrhoea tablet, probably the equivalent of Imodium or something similar.

'I assumed it has fallen in as they packed the toy away, no one has spotted it, there is no quality control.

'Because it was a Disney toy they assumed it was part of it and were asking if they could eat it.

'If they could have got at it they would have done but I took it away fairly quickly. It could have made our girls very ill.'

The singalong toy was bought by Mr Wilkes Read's sister-in-law. He believes the pill must have fallen in while it was being packaged

Mr Wilkes Read said he was glad he was there when the girls opened the gift as one of them may have swallowed the pill

The Singalong Karaoke was bought by Mr Wilkes Read's sister-in-law Leanne in Target in New York.

She quickly snapped it up to bring home for the girls, unaware of what lay inside.

As Isabella and Lola quickly ripped into the present morning, desperate to sing along to their favourite Disney movie songs, they found the slightly bashed pill. 

Using the colouring and markings the girls' father discovered it was a prescription diarrhoea pill, which could seriously harm their daughters

'I jumped on it pretty quickly and removed it before they could do anything with it," the pilot added.

'I can't believe it was in there, it is appalling really. They should really check these things, it could have made my girls really ill if we hadn't have spotted it.'
