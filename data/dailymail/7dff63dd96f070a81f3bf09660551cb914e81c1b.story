Sir Elton John was thankfully still standing after a comical fall during the Mylan World Team Tennis Smash Hits charity event at the Royal Albert Hall on Sunday.

There were audible gasps from the crowd as the 67-year-old singer fell backwards off his chair as he watched Team Elton John take on Team Billie Jean King in a tennis exhibition event held to raise funds for his AIDS Foundation.

But Elton quickly brushed himself off and got back to his feet before watching his team suffer a 22-16 defeat as former British No 1 Tim Henman rolled back the years with a clinching victory against former US Open champion Andy Roddick.

The team tennis concept has been well-received in Asia recently through the newly-launched International Tennis Premier League - and it also proved a hit in London with the crowd lapping up the entertaining tennis on show.

The format featured one set of men’s and women’s singles, men’s and women’s doubles and mixed doubles with sets being played as the first to five games with a best-of-nine-point tiebreaker at 4-4.

Every game counted towards the overall score and to make sure that play did not drag on too long, a number of rules variations were introduced with sudden death points at deuce and no let serves.

And it did not take long for them to have an impact in the first match of the evening as Team Elton John’s Martina Hingis and Heather Watson took on Kim Clijsters and Sabine Lisicki.

Former world No 1 Hingis could only smile as she forgot about the no let rule and stopped after her serve hit the net cord with Clijsters taking full advantage by stepping up and putting away a forehand return.

But Hingis made up for her faux pas with some impressive volleying as she and Watson won the match 5-4 (5-2).

Andy Roddick - who earlier in the day lost the final of the ATP Champions Tour event to Chilean former world No 5 Fernando Gonzalez - then teamed up with John McEnroe but the Team Elton John pairing were hammered 5-0 by the British combination of Henman and Jamie Murray.

Former Wimbledon finalist Sabine Lisicki was too strong for 22-year-old Brit Watson as the German won 5-3 in their singles clash to put Team Billie Jean King in control at 14-8.

But Hingis, the 34-year-old who still plays on the professional doubles tour, and McEnroe gave Team Elton John a lifeline with a 5-3 victory against Murray and Clijsters.

Any hopes of a comeback, though, were dashed by Henman, aged 40, who, despite facing booming serves of 130mph plus, beat 32-year-old Roddick 5-3 in their first meeting for ten years.

Henman said: ‘It’s just been such a fantastic day. It’s my debut in World Team Tennis and Billie Jean and Elton just do such a fantastic job.

‘It’s brilliant. The matches are moving along quickly. It’s got a great history and hopefully the event can go from strength to strength and we can continue to raise some amazing funds for a great charity.’
