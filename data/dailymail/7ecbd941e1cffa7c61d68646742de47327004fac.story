Fasten your seat belts and prepare for lift off.

It's all part of teenage pilot Holly Adams' daily routine, who wakes up every morning to travel to Macquarie Anglican Grammar School via her customised pink and white Jabiru 2200 aircraft.

As she flew 3,500 ft above the ground, the 16-year-old looked down and giggled at her fellow classmates who were on her regular 40-minute bus ride from Narromine to Dubbo in NSW.

Flying on her first solo flight to school on Tuesday, Holly, who is one of Australia's youngest flyers, performed a smooth landing at Dubbo Airport just 10 minutes later.

'It's a good feeling not having to catch the bus,' Holly told Daily Mail Australia.

Meet 16-year-old Holly Adams, who has just begun travelling to school via her Jabiru 2200 aircraft

The plucky pilot said one of the most challenging parts of learning to fly was learning how to land

'Some of my friend's didn't believe me when I told them I was flying in for school but they were really excited.

'My family know I’m confident with flying and were thrilled to hear I landed safely – and all my teachers and my boyfriend have all been super supportive.'

It all started at the tender age of 15 when she started taking up flying lessons with professional instructors after watching a pilot show with her dad one night in September 2013.

'We saw all these pilots flying around farms and crops and dad asked: "Do you want to go for a lesson?" and I said: "Yeah, I'd love to,’ she said.

'And I've loved it ever since.’

But within four months of training, she turned her backyard hobby into a short commute to school. 

'It's quite common to see young kids fly out  in rural areas,' Holly said. 

While she has perfected her navigation skills overtime, the plucky pilot said one of the most challenging parts of learning to fly was learning how to land.

'It was one of the most difficult things to learn but once I had done the land on my own, I knew I could do it from here on,' Holly said.

'I had to learn all the instruments, like how to switch it on and warming the engine up before flying.'

After seeking permission from her school principal Craig Mansour this week, the brace student will be flying to school every day from Monday.

Her plane, which was given to her as a gift from her parents for Christmas last year, is decked out with her own personalised designs along with her name 'Holly' printed on the tail. 

Despite her fast-track to school, Holly's boyfriend Alex Panetta or a family member nearby will be waiting outside the airport each day to drive her the extra kilometres for class.

'I'm currently on my L's but I do see myself flying for as long as I can,' Holly said.

As Holly is not old enough for a driver's license just yet, she said the age to qualify for a RA-Aus license is just 16-years-old.

'I've been flying solo for a few months now - taking my close friends and family up in the air,' Holly said.

With the privilege of flying anywhere in Australia, Holly has already started a bucket list of places to go, including a trip to Western Australia with her family or to Nyngan in NSW, where she was born, to visit relatives.

'It's nice knowing if I ever wanted to go to the beach, I can just fly to the beach,' Holly said.

'I'm just excited to fly anywhere I want in Australia.'

She plans to get her helicopter license when she turns 17 and then her commercial license at 18 as well as a career as a commercial airline pilot when she finishes school.

'I would like to go into the helicopters, commercial airlines or private jets,' she said.

'I actually have work experience lined up with Qantas this month so I'm looking forward to that.'

And for all those youngsters interested in flying, Holly said: 'Definitely go for it!"

'You need to be committed and train every day - don't drag it on because it's something you can't put off for weeks or even months as you start to forget things,' she said. 

'It feels amazing to start learning at such a young age and you could turn it into a career when you're older - so start saving.'
