British model and presenter Alexa Chung has added yet another string to her already-impressive bow, making her musical debut in a new short film directed by Gia Coppola. 

The video, which was shot at Coppola's home in the Hollywood Hills, was created exclusively for online retailer MyTheresa.com as part of their new Tunes campaign in order to promote the 31-year-old New York-based model's new Alexa Chung for AG denim collection.

Appropriately, the leggy brunette is seen singing her own version of Stevie Nicks' 1994 hit Blue Denim in the clip, and also takes the opportunity to poke a bit of fun at herself; Chung's karaoke performance is seen clearing a crowded party after she insists on repeating the song over and over again.

'Oh no, not again, please,' one party-goer is overheard saying as the opening chords of the song begin to play. 

'It's like the 90th time that she has played this song,' a second person adds. 

'She's so cute, but she's singing it again,' a woman chimes in. 'How many times have you heard this song.'

Chung boldly ignores the frustrated glares from her fellow guests and continues with her rendition, throwing herself into the performance and swaying in time to the music, not once needing to glance at the screen behind her, which bears the classic song's iconic lyrics.

Despite the lighthearted comedy aspects to her performance however, it's clear that Chung's interest in music extends beyond the realms of this one short film. 

In fact, the former MTV presenter actually recorded a version of the hit at a studio in New York, before stepping in front of the camera to film with Coppola.

Chart-topper in the making? As well as performing the song in the video, Chung also recorded a version of it while in New York

Dream team: The clip was made exclusively for online retailer MyTheresa.com, who enlisted the help of Pao Alto director Gia Coppola 

'The choice of song was inspired by Alexa’s new collaborative collection of denim pieces with LA based label AG,' a spokesperson from MyTheresa.com said. 

'Alexa Chung’s Blue Denim was recorded in New York in November 2014 and produced by famed musician Dev Hynes. 

'To accompany the track mytheresa.com commissioned Gia Coppola to direct the music clip, shot entirely in her Hollywood Hills home.'

Although impressive, Chung's performance is by no means the first time that a fashion superstar has dipped their toe into the music industry. 

In particular, model turned actress Cara Delevingne has made no secret of her desire to pursue a career in music - and has lent her husky singing voice to more than one high-profile fashion campaign.

Happy holidays: Chung has recently been posting images of herself and her close friends, including Pixie Geldof (pictured) enjoying a sun-soaked vacation in the Maldives

Most recently the 24-year-old model, who is close friends with Chung, performed a specially-written song with chart-topper Pharell Williams for a short film, titled Reincarnation, directed by Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld.

But this short film is the first time that Chung has ever shared her own vocal talents with the world - and if the overwhelmingly positive response on Twitter is anything to go by, many are hoping it will not be the last. 

'Alexa Chung is pretty skinny and funny and now she can sing as well this is so unfair,' one user wrote, while another added: 'Alexa Chung's ad for MyTheresa.com is so good. Now I wanna wear denim and sing karaoke.'

The launch of the film comes just days after Chung was pictured enjoying a sun-soaked New Year's vacation in the Maldives alongside close friends Pixie Geldof, daughter of Bob Geldof, radio presenter Nick Grimshaw and model Daisy Lowe.
