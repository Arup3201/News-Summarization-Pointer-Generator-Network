A boy of 11 has died after he slipped and fell into a canal as he and classmates tottered across a narrow pipe in a tightrope-style game of dare.

Robbie Williamson was inching along the disused former water pipe running alongside a bridge when he lost his balance and tumbled into the water.

Friends looked on in horror as the youngster hit his head on the canal bank as he fell - knocking himself unconscious.

A neighbour alerted by their screams jumped into the Leeds-Liverpool Canal in Burnley, Lancashire, after seeing him lying face down in the water.

The youngster was pulled out and appeared to recover after being revived at the canalside following CPR.

But his condition deteriorated in the ambulance and he was pronounced dead in Royal Blackburn Hospital. A post mortem test was due to be carried out to establish how Robbie died.

Today Lancashire Police said the incident at 7pm on Tuesday was not being treated as suspicious.

His father Dean Williamson, 36, a joiner, mother Nicola and older brother Morgan, 16, were being comforted.

Robbie Williamson's devastated father Dean Williamson and step-mother Claire lay flowers at the scene of the death of the 11-year-old. He described Robbie as Robbie 'the best, he was cheeky and smiley he was a lovely lad.'

A heartbreaking message written by Dean Williamson, following the death of his 11-year-old son, Robbie

Mr
 Williamson arrived at the scene in his car with his current partner 
Clare and broke down in tears saying: 'Robbie was the best, he was 
cheeky and smiley he was a lovely lad.'

Robbie’s
 uncle John Williamson, 37 said: 'Robbie was a really active lad and 
full of life. He was always out on his motorbike always being 
mischievous.

'All
 I know is that he was on a pipe and he has slipped off and has gone 
face down into the water. He was adventurous.He has a brother Morgan who
 is 16.

'Dean is devastated, all the family are. They can’t stop crying. On the way there he was apparently shouting and screaming.

'When
 he got there they took him for a brain scan then his heart stopped. 
They revived him but his heart stopped again. We’re all absolutely 
distraught.'

The tragedy occurred after Robbie had finished classes on the first day of the summer term at the 957 pupil Shuttleworth College in Padiham where he was in Year Seven.

He was larking about with friends when he got into difficulties whilst trying to cross the canal via the rusting pipe. Neighbour Peter Graham heard the commotion and dived into the water.

Ex-soldier Mr Graham, 44, a carer who learnt first aid in Royal Artillery said: 'I tried my hardest for that lad - I feel really upset.

'You can replace time but you can’t replace a life. I think he was walking across the pipe and got across and then slipped and whacked his head. There were three lads there.

'I heard someone shouting “there’s a kid in the canal” and I ran downstairs and outside. I saw a white Tshirt in the water and the other children.

Bunches of flowers and heartbreaking messages of condolence have been left along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Burnley at the spot where Robbie Williamson plunged into the water

'I don’t know how long he’d been in the water. I just jumped in, i didn’t have my shoes on. I didn’t think I just did what I could.

'The water is waist deep but it was raining yesterday so I think he’s slipped. I just didn’t think, all I thought was that it was a kid and jumped in.

'The boy was crouched over in the water and the kids on the bridge screaming. I pulled him out but he was blue and appeared not to be breathing so me and my brother Stephen were pressing his chest.

'I got him breathing and colour started to coming to his face. I was pushing his stomach and he was sick and started wheezing and I could hear him breathing.

'The ambulance took about eight minutes and took him to hospital but the next thing we knew he had died. It’s such a tragedy, my 11-year old daughter Shannon was sat with him at school earlier that day.

Sarah Stevenson, mum of Robbie’s best friend Josh said: 'The boys clamber onto the pipe in a game of dare.

They said they have all done it but it shouldn’t be that easy - that pipe needs blocking off.

'Robbie was Josh’s best pal - he was a cheeky chappy. I can’t believe it, it’s just devastating.'

Another neighbour who didn’t wan to be named said: 'The pipe should be removed as it serves no useful purpose and is a danger to children.

'I live in this area and I see kids walking up and playing on the pipe. It’s not in use anymore. The kids mess around on it all the time. It’s appalling.

'The kids don’t have anything to do in Burnley and they assume walking along the pipe is a game because they hey want an adventure.

'They are daft and don’t see it from an adults point of view about how dangerous it is.'

Lancashire Police said: 'The boy had been crossing the canal bridge, walking across a pipe where he has lost his balance and fell into the water.

'A passer-by jumped into the water and pulled him out. He was given CPR until the emergency services arrived.

'The boy was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital where he sadly later died. The death is not being treated as suspicious.'

An inquest is expected to be opened and adjourned.
