An elderly couple have been found beaten to death inside their Texas home, police have said.

Don Rentz, 83, and his wife, Reda, 80, were discovered dead on the floor of their Atascocita house on Saturday after their concerned children, who live elsewhere, asked a neighbor to check on them.

They had both suffered 'extremely traumatic' injuries and had been dead for several days. Police have launched an investigation into the murders, but so far they have no suspects nor motive.

However, investigators are reportedly looking at robbery as a possible motive after finding the grandparents' belongings strewn around their home and several drawers seemingly rifled through. 

Police were called to the property in the 6700 block of Pacific Crest Court after a neighbor checked on the Rentzs at the request of their two children, who had not heard from them for over a week.

The neighbor had knocked on the couple's front door and received no response. When officers arrived at the scene at about 12.30pm, they apparently discovered the back door was unlocked.

After entering the house, police found Mr and Mrs Rentz lying dead on the floor. They both had injuries that were consistent with violent beating deaths, officials said.

Detective: 'Both of them had been there several days. It appears that they have both suffered from extreme trauma,' said Detective Ben Beall (pictured), adding that some drawers had apparently been rifled through

'Both of them had been there several days. It appears that they have both suffered from extreme trauma,' Detective Ben Beall, of the Harris County Sheriff's Office, told KHOU.com . 

He added: 'There were some areas of [the house] that looked like somebody had gone through some of the drawers but at this point we are not even sure what if anything is missing.'

The victims were last seen alive when they were sitting on their front driveway in lawn chairs in the sunshine on February 26, Click2Houston.com reported. It is unknown exactly when they died.

They were both retired and lived alone.

Following Saturday's grim discovery, Harris County Sheriff's detectives and forensic teams spent more than 24 hours searching for evidence at the property, which has been cordoned off. 

However, officials said on Monday they are yet to identify any suspects or determine a motive in the brutal murder case, it is reported. Neighbors said they were 'shocked' by the couple's deaths.

Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the Harris County Sheriff's Office Homicide Unit at 713-967-5810. They can also call Crimestoppers anonymously at 713-222-TIPS (8477).
