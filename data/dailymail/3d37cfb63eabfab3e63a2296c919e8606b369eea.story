A young Yazidi woman forced into sex slavery by the Islamic State begged the West to bomb the brothel where she was being held after militants raped her 30 times in just a few hours, it is claimed.

The unidentified woman is understood to have been kept as a prisoner of the jihadists somewhere in western Iraq having been captured by ISIS during the Sinjar massacre in early August.

A group raising awareness of ISIS' persecution of women in the vast swathes of the Middle East under its control said the woman had contacted Kurdish peshmerga fighters by telephone to plead for the brothel to be bombed to put the women held as sex slaves out of their misery.

She allegedly told the fighters she had been raped so frequently that she could no longer use the toilet, adding that the ordeal has been so harrowing that she plans to commit suicide even if freed.

Horror: The woman said she had been raped so many times by ISIS militants (pictured) that she could no longer use the toilet, adding that the ordeal has been so harrowing that she plans to commit suicide even if freed

No life: 5-7,000 Yazidi women are also being held in makeshift detention centres by ISIS, where they either been taken away and sold into slavery or handed over to jihadists as concubines

Details of the woman's brutal experience at the hands of the Islamic State emerged during an interview with Kurdish activists staging demonstrations in London to raise awareness of the plight of women in the Middle East.

During an interview with BBC World Service, a man identified as Karam described how a friend embedded with the peshmerga took a phone call from the Yazidi woman.

Describing the woman as crying on the phone, Karam quoted her as saying: 'If you know where we are please bomb us... There is no life after this. I'm going to kill myself anyway - others have killed themselves this morning.'

'I've been raped 30 times and it's not even lunchtime. I can't go to the toilet. Please bomb us,' he claimed the woman added.

Brutal: Last week the UN confirmed that thousands of Yazidis were slaughtered in scenes reminiscent of the Bosnian Srebrenica massacre when ISIS swept through northern Iraq in August

The group of Kurdish activists to which Karam belongs have been staging protests in central London to raise awareness of the plight of women living under the brutal oppression of the Islamic State.

Among their recent demonstrations was the establishment of a mock-slave market where niqab-wearing women were seen chained together while masked men used loudspeakers to auction them off to the highest bidder.

A video of the group's fake slave auction -  run to shock those living in the West into confronting the grim reality of ISIS rule - has already been viewed more than 265,000 times on YouTube

The group says they used information provided by sources on the ground to help them portray the scenes authentically.

Last week the UN confirmed that thousands of Yazidis were slaughtered in scenes reminiscent of the Bosnian Srebrenica massacre when ISIS swept through northern Iraq in August. 

Researchers, piecing together reports of attacks, have now concluded that more than 5,000 Yazidi were gunned down in a series of massacres by jihadist.

A further 5-7,000 women are also being held in makeshift detention centres, where they either been taken away and sold into slavery or handed over to jihadists as concubines.

Five detention centres in the town of Tal Afar is thought to hold around 3,500 women and children.

An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane.

Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'. 

Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles.

Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'

Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network. 

In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place. 

Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally.

Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene.  

Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying

Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies.

In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups.

Shim described herself as 'surprised' at the accusation, 'because I have nothing to hide and I have never done anything aside my job.'
