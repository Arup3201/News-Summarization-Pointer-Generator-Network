Two of the arrested suspects accused of gang-raping a 51-year-old Danish tourist in New Delhi have appeared in court with their faces covered.

Police and officials had to hold back an angry crowd that had gathered outside as they were led in.

The suspects were ordered to
 be held in police custody for three days for further investigation.

Two other suspects were picked up 
Wednesday night and accused of taking part in Tuesday's attack, which 
lasted nearly three hours and involved six men.

It happened near Connaught Place, a popular 
shopping area in the heart of New Delhi, police spokesman Rajan Bhagat 
said.

‘We have identified the culprits. All of 
them are vagabonds,’ a police official said, according to the Press 
Trust of India news agency.

The two men brought before the court in New Delhi were part of a gang of six that allegedly raped a Danish tourist

It's a case that highlights the plague of sexual violence in the country and threatens to tarnish its tourism industry.

Violence
 against women in India has caused increasing alarm since the fatal gang
 rape of a 23-year-old Indian physiotherapy student in New Delhi in 
December 2012. Several foreign tourists also have been targeted in 
attacks that often get international attention, although Indian women 
are assaulted far more frequently.

Tourism
 figures fell significantly in the three months following the 2012 gang 
rape, with visits by women dropping 35 percent, according to the 
Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. Although the 
industry appears to have bounced back, recent attacks on foreign women 
could have another chilling effect.

Tourism accounted for 6.6 percent of India's GDP in 2012, the latest year for which figures are available.

Last
 week, an 18-year-old German charity worker said she was assaulted on a 
train in southern India by a fellow passenger.

She said she was too 
scared to shout for help from the other passengers asleep in her 
compartment, police said.

The teen was attacked during a 
train journey from Mangalore to Chennai, according to police. She was 
travelling there to carry out volunteer work.

A man from Bihar has been arrested for the attack.

In
 March, a Swiss woman reported being gang-raped in central India as she 
and her husband camped out in a forest after bicycling from the temple 
town of Orchha. And in June, a 30-year-old American woman was gang-raped
 in the northern resort town of Manali as she was hitchhiking to her 
guest house after visiting a friend.

Police
 said the Danish tourist was raped at knifepoint Tuesday after she 
approached a group of men for directions back to her hotel. Instead of 
helping her, the men lured her to a secluded spot and raped her 
repeatedly, according to police.

One
 of the suspects in custody was found with the victim's glasses case and
 1,000 rupees ($16) in cash, a police statement said.

Last
 year, the Tourism Ministry launched an ‘I Respect Women’ campaign to 
reassure travelers. Some hotels also have introduced new programs 
focused on safety. Anasuya Basu, director of marketing at Le Meridien 
Hotel in New Delhi, said the hotel has designated rooms for single women
 and recommends that women only take hotel taxis.

Public
 fury over the 2012 rape case has led to more stringent laws that 
doubled prison terms for rape to 20 years and criminalized voyeurism and
 stalking. But many women say daily indignities and abuse continue 
unabated and that the new laws have not made the streets any safer.

Still,
 there has been a surge in the number of rapes being reported recently, 
suggesting women are emboldened to speak up. Between January and October
 last year, 1,330 rapes were reported in Delhi and its suburbs, compared
 with 706 for all of 2012, according to government figures.
