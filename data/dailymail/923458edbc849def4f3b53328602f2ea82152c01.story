A father-of-two who tried to make a batch of home-made rocket fuel was left with horrific burns when it exploded. 

Chris Monger, 26, decided to create the substance for 'a laugh' after seeing a recipe for it on a YouTube video. 

But the joke backfired when the upper half of his body was scorched with flames after the mixture he was preparing in a saucepan erupted into a fireball.

Mr Monger, 26, who lives in Bradwell, near Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, suffered horrific burns after trying to make home-made rocket fuel he saw on a YouTube video 

The father-of-two tried to create the substance for 'a laugh' but said: 'It is the most stupid thing that I have ever done'

Mr Monger, who lives in Bradwell, near Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, dropped to the floor and rolled around to put the flames out, before his mother hosed him down. 

The father-of-two suffered severe burns to his body and face and spent five days wrapped in bandages in hospital. 

He said: 'It is most stupid thing that I have ever done.

'I only tried to make this stuff so I could set it off in the garden and create lots of white smoke for a laugh - but it all went horribly wrong.

'I could easily have been blinded and I consider myself very lucky that my injuries were not far more serious.'

He added: 'I just want it to be a lesson to people not to mess around with fire because the same thing could happen to them.

'People should take care when they try and copy things they see on YouTube. I will not be doing it again.'

Mr Monger tried to create the rocket fuel after seeing instructions on how to make it using basic household ingredients. 

He said: 'I decided to give it a go and I made about four batches in an old saucepan without any problem.

'But the saucepan I was working with was a cheap one and the bottom had all scratched away and some of the inside metal was getting thinner and thinner.

'I was caramelising the mixture into a paste and I'd pulled it off the hob slightly, but there was one edge that was still on and that got red hot.

'When I went to put it back on the hob and stir it one last time, the bottom fell off the saucepan and the mixture hit the hob. 

'That's when it went bang. It lit instantly and blew up in my face.

'Most of the flames were sucked up by the extractor fan, but they also engulfed my body as I did not have a shirt on.

'My mum screamed and I just dropped to the floor and rolled around to put out the flames.'

Mr Monger, who works as a mobile phone technician, then went into the back garden so his mother could hose him down while his sister Dina, 24, phoned an ambulance.

He was taken to the James Paget University Hospital at Gorleston-on-sea near Great Yarmouth and from there, he was transferred to the St Andrew's specialist burns unit at Broomfield Hospital, in Chelmsford, Essex.

He said: 'It did not seem to hurt at first, but then the paramedics put a special cream on my burns in the ambulance and I was in agony.

'My neighbours who are five doors down could hear me screaming in the back of the ambulance - but within five or ten minutes it felt a lot of better.' 

He was discharged last weekend following the accident on Saturday, August 3.  

Doctors have told him he should not suffer any scarring and he is now concentrating on recovering.
