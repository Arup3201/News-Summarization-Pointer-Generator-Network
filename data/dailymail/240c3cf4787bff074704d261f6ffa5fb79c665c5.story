Two of Muhammad Ali's daughters have played down concerns regarding the former heavyweight boxing champion's health.

Ali, often regarded as one of the greatest fighters of all time, was diagnosed with Parkinson's syndrome in 1984 and speculation has been rife in recent years that his condition is deteriorating.

He appeared frail while attending the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, while his brother, Rahman, said in an interview in February last year that his sibling could die within days.

Ali recently posted a picture on Twitter with the caption: 'Don't believe the hype. Feeling great earlier today'

But Maryum and Hana have revealed that while their father continues to battle with the progressive neurological condition, the 72-year-old is otherwise doing fine.

'Most stories come from people who don't understand Parkinson's,' said Maryum to BBC Sport.

'He has never been on his deathbed. He has Parkinson's, he has had it for 30 years and it is a progressive degenerative disease but he does well and is healthy outside the Parkinson's.

'For some people it is so hard for them to see the old Ali and this Ali suffering with Parkinson's but he is doing well. He enjoys his life and he is clear-minded - he doesn't have dementia or Alzheimer's and understands who you are.'

Indeed, according to Hana, Ali is enjoying the attention at the rumours.

'He likes being talked about. He thinks it is funny and says he isn't dying,' said Hana.

'Even when these stories come out he gets excited and thinks he is going to make the front page of the papers.'
