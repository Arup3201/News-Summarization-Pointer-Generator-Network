A teenager who had an affair with his teacher has told how he was driven to the brink of suicide by feelings of guilt after she was jailed for the relationship.

Jimmy Pallais, now 17, had a series of trsysts with married former Houston English teacher Kathryn Murray, 31, before the pair were eventually caught in bed at the family home.

She was jailed for a year this week, after a court heard how their relationship began when when Murray was assigned to help Spanish-speaking Pallais after he was adopted from Costa Rica and brought to America by his parents at age 14.

Thoughts of suicide: Jimmy Pallais, now 17, said he thought of killing himself to make the fallout with his affair with married Kathryn Murray, 31, 'go away'

The pair were separated after Jimmy confessed to having a crush on her, but a relationship began after he kissed her in school. The pair had sex in Murray's classroom at Memorial Middle School several times, booked into a hotel and were finally caught in the family home by Jimmy's 12-year-old brother.

As Murray faced jail, Jimmy told ABC's 20/20: 'that maybe if I [would] kill myself they [would forget] about this.'  

The show also revealed new details of the events leading up to the pair's affair.

As Jimmy's feelings for Murray grew, he wrote her a letter confessing his love before tearing it up and giving it to Murray to throw away. But she ended up reading it anyway and told him: 'I read you're letter. I really like you, like, for real.'

Jimmy's parents suspicions grew as he told them how 'pretty' Murray was at home and the pair were separated.

But the pair continued to chat online and the affair started when Jimmy walked up to Murray in her classroom and kissed her, before walking to his first class. When he saw her again, Murray said she could kiss him again - and the affair developed with a series of sexual liasions in her classroom and a hotel.

They were discovered when Jimmy's little brother found them in bed together and Jimmy's parents found a text from Murray reading: 'You know I love you... I don't know what we're going to do, but we're going to be happy together... I'm worried about how obvious we are at school. I'm miss you.'

His parents said: 'She robbed him of his childhood.I think it took his innocence away, because...that was his first time having sex.'

The inappropriate relationship began in February 2012 when Murray, who is still married, was tutoring the Spanish-speaking eighth grader and the two went on to have 'repeated' sexual encounters, according to KHOU.

On one occasion, Murray picked up the teen from a school dance after his dad dropped him off and took him to a hotel where they had sex for two hours.

The couple were caught the following night by the teen's younger brother who found them in bed at the family home while their parents were away.

Murray was fired that month following the allegations but remained free on $50,000 bail.

Police discovered that the two had sex in a classroom at least twice and that prior to her arrest, Murray had closed her bank account and planned to skip the border to Mexico.

At school: In the course of their investigation, police discovered that Murray had sex with the 15-year-old student she was tutoring at least two times in a classroom at Memorial Middle School

Despite being barred from seeing the teen by a judge, the affair continued.

In January 2013, Murray was arrested again when she was found with the teen at her father's home.

When police showed up at the house, the teen, then 16, tried to escape through the back door.

She was charged with harboring a runaway and this time her bond was revoked.

Sentencing in the case happened on Tuesday.

Won't stop: Murray's affair with the boy continued even after she was arrested. Police found the then 16-year-old with Murray at her father's house and she was charged with harboring a minor

Murray attended Memorial Middle and High School and had been working in the Spring Branch ISD for the previous three years as a language arts teacher. 

Records say she is still married to her husband and they live at the same address in Houston.

To this day, the teen she had relations with insists that they are in love but his mother calls him a victim.

'We are not good, we are very hurt. My son is really confused, hurt. We working with him very closely but he’s not good, not good at all,' the mother said.
