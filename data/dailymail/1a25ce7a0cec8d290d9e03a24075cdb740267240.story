Scandal on Sesame Street: Kevin Clash, pictured with Elmo, allegedly had sex with a 16-year-old boy when he was 45

The voice of Elmo in Sesame Street sent graphic emails to a sexual partner who claims the puppeteer slept with him when he was underage.

Kevin Clash exchanged messages with his accuser in 2010 in which he apologised for constantly talking about sex and promised to make all of his 'dreams come true'.

Clash, who has left the show in the wake of the accusations, told the man almost 30 years his junior that he loved him and offered to buy him a ticket to visit him in New York, it has emerged.

The Sesame Street stalwart, who has worked on the show since the mid-80s, admits to having a sexual 
relationship with the accuser but insists it only took place after the younger man was an adult.

Clash, 52, took a leave of 
absence from the children's show after the 23-year-old contacted the programme's lawyers and told them he had a sexual 
relationship with the puppeteer seven years ago.

At the time of the alleged relationship, Clash was 45 and the boy was 16 - with the age of consent 17 in New York.

In the latest emails published by TMZ, sent well after the accuser turned 18, Clash wrote: 'I'm sorry that I keep talking about sex with you, its driving me insane.'

He added: 'I want you to know that I love
you and I will never hurt you. I'm here to protect you and make sure 
your dreams come true...

'I'll have my assistant book a ticket for you to come to NY and we can talk about this in person.'

Clash said he will now focus on fighting the allegations, which he described as false and defamatory.

He said the relationship was between two consenting adults that he was deeply 
saddened that the younger man was 'trying to make it into something it was not.'

Allegations: Clash has left the popular children's show to fight the accusations

The 
accuser reportedly felt he was being silenced after his initial meeting with Sesame Street lawyers.

He is now being represented by Andreozzi and Associates - the firm that worked with one of the victims
in the Jerry Sandusky child rape case.

In August, the accuser's lawyers wrote a
letter to Sesame Street accusing the programme of trying to 'discredit 
the victim in order to protect its 
employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters.'

The letter also claimed the show's attitude 'places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of
a young man.'

Sesame Workshop officials, however, said they found the  the allegation of underage sex was 
unsubstantiated after a thorough 
investigation.

They say that rather than trying to hush up the accuser, they asked for evidence of his allegations, which was not received.

TMZ reported they had seen an email supposedly sent to the accuser by Clash, 
acknowledging they had the affair when he was 16, but officials believe it is fake as they say the
accuser never mentioned such an email existed.

Sesame Street disciplined Mr Clash 
for inappropriate use of company email after they found his messages to 
the accuser, but they reportedly did not indicate an illegal sexual 
relationship.

They said the divorced father of a 19-year-old girl had shown poor judgment, but claimed 
his leave of absence was to allow him to defend his reputation in the wake of the damaging allegations. 

Clash's ex-wife, Gina, declined to comment, but a friend who answered the door at her Baltimore home told the New York Daily News that the former nurse is 'surviving'.

A neighbour who did not wish to be identified defended Clash, saying: 'He was really good to her and the family. He's a really nice guy.'

Sesame Workshop insisted the scandal surrounding Clash does not mean the end of Elmo.

'Elmo is bigger than any one person,' the company said.

Clash has been Elmo's puppeteer for two decades, performing on the show as well as for PBS specials, DVD releases and TV movies, while earning nine Daytime Emmy Awards.

He eventually assumed the title of Sesame Street's Senior Puppet Coordinator and Muppet Captain, while also directing and producing show segments and TV specials.

He published an autobiography about his career in 2006 called My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud.

Earlier this year he appeared in Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey, a documentary detailing Clash's journey from a childhood obsession with puppets to assuming his role on the iconic show.
