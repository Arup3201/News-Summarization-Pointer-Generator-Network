As the US Open begins we're almost as excited about the prospect of marvelling at Kim Sears' glossy hair and courtside chic as we are about watching the tennis matches.

And Andy Murray's long-term girlfriend didn't let us down on day one, offering up a masterclass in dressing down in style as she watched her tennis beau beat Robin Haase of the Netherlands during his men's singles first round match  at the USTA Billie Jean King National.

The 25-year-old showcased a light summer tan and went make-up free at the match. She wore a classic black shell top teamed with trophy trousers, accessorizing with  black Ray-ban sunglasses and an exciting new piece of arm candy.

We've missed you, Kim! Miss Sears arrived at USTA Billie Jean King National to watched Andy Murray beat Robin Haase - she was armed with her new £475 arm candy by Milli Millu

Clearly bored of her  Mulberry Willow and Aspinal of London Marylebone totes, the Surrey-born artist was championing little-known British brand, Milli Millu.

Kim's £475 bag, The Luxembourg, is described on the brand's website as a 'striking shoulder bag with a modern edge.' 

The black, green and off-white grained calf leather comes embellished with an oversized front pocket and pale gold lock.

Fans of the brand include Brit girls Pippa Middleton,  Sienna Miller, Kate Moss and Cheryl Cole, who wore hers in her latest L’Oreal TV ad.

When Pippa was pictured with one of the brand's day bags earlier this year they sold out out within hours and waiting lists were created for the women of West London. 

Bare-faced beauty: The 25-year-old went make-up free at the match and showed off her summer tan as she watched her beau tensely 

Tense: Kim watched nervously as Andy Murray's played Dutchman Robin Haase and, saving three break points, somehow managed to close it out by extracting errors from his opponent

Number one fan: Andy's long-term girlfriend never misses one of his matches and has been credited for keeping him grounded off the court

Enjoying the sun: Kim, who opted for a pared-back look at the match, showed off a healthy glow as she sat courtside 

The brand was established by Mireia Llusia-Lindh, a Barcelona-born, London-based designer and entrepreneur.

After working as a strategy advisor to numerous consumer and luxury goods firms such as Burberry and LVMH, Mireia set up her own brand. 

Every one of her bags comes with 'interior design' equipped to store a laptop/ work essentials and they are handcrafted in the south of Spain using the finest Italian and Spanish materials. For every bag purchased, Milli Millu funds a set of lifesaving vaccines and treatments aimed to save the life of a child in need.  

Murray now meets Germany's qualifier Matthias Bachinger.

Errol Douglas MBE, hair stylist to multiple A-list clients spanning film, fashion, music and business, shares a few tips on achieving that fabulous finish on a blow dry in between salon visits.

PREPARATION IS CRUCIAL – ALL WASHES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL

'It’s really important to select the right shampoo and conditioner that begins the journey to the ultimate polished finish – a shampoo and conditioner that clean and hydrate without harshness or weighing hair down – it’s a crucial balance. Water temperature is also vital to get right – make it luke warm to cool. Hot water opens the scalp’s sebaceous glands which stimulates an unhelpful grease risk.'

EASY ON THE PRODUCT – LESS IS ABSOLUTELY MORE

'This really is the most common blow dry blunder: overloading the hair with too much product. It’s true that damp hair is the first step in introducing something that assists styling, but when you select the right product you really do need very little of it. Before applying squeeze and pat dry with a towel, avoid rough drying. Also place the product in the centre of your hand and warm it before applying first at the roots through the middle and to the ends.'

Errol recommends: Moroccanoil Treatment Light (for fine or blonde hair) – 'Apply a small amount from mid-length to ends. An extra tiny amount can be applied after blow drying to tame any fly-aways or condition dry ends even more.'

DIRECTION? BACK TO FRONT – LITERALLY

'Divide the hair into two sections, start atthe back and work your way forward. This technique contributes significantly to how long the blow dry lasts. If you’d like some movement in the end result, pin the section your not working on up, this gives that lift Kim has at the root that gives body but not bouffant.'

TENSION IS A GOOD THING – FOR A BLOW DRY!

'Introducing tension and pressure at the root with a barrel brush with dryer nozzle pointed downwards to smooth the hair shaft as it goes gives the shine in the finish (equally a dryer than dries quickly helps here. The Errol Douglas Infrared dryer dries from the inside out so locks in moisture and helps minimise frizz and drying time). The super sleek end result is entirely down to firm pressure with the right brush as you blow dry. It creates root movement, and this very movement at the root is like the scaffolding of the blow dry you construct. Use a top quality anti-static round brush from the beginning until just before the polish stage.'

Errol recommends: Morocconoil Luminous Hairspray – 'Those looking for extra volume can spray a little on the roots at this stage of the blow dry.'

SWAP BRUSH & ADD SHINE – IT’S ALL IN THE FINISH

'Change tools here as your prepare to really invest in a high shine,clean finish for your blow dry. Use a paddle brush to dry the remaining ends, and then comb through each section with straighteners. Spray hairspray up and in as opposed to directly onto the crown – it'll weigh it down.'
