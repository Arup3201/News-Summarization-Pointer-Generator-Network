A 'missing' hour from the timeline of the final day of a young woman who was burned to death in her car that could hold the clue to solving her murder, investigators say.

At 6.10pm on December 6, 2014, Jessica Chambers was driving on Highway 6 into Batesville, Mississippi. Twenty minutes later, at 6.30pm, she was in her home town, Courtland.

By the next time she was seen, she was lying on a rural road by her blazing Kia Rio sedan, dying after suffering 98 per cent burns.

She wasn't found until 8.09pm, but investigators place her at that scene by 7.30pm. Now they are focusing on the final hour before she arrived, in the hope it will provide the key to her murder. 

Horrific: Jessica Chambers, 19, was burned alive in December by an unknown assailant. Authorities have released a timeline of her final hours in the hope it might jog the memory of potential witnesses

Grief:  Miss Chambers' mother, Lisa Daugherty, has said her daughter went out at 5pm on the day of her murder, after telling her she was going to buy food and clean her car

Panola County District Attorney John Champion has released details of Miss Chambers' final hours. He hopes they will the memory of  witnesses who can plug the gaps in the investigation.

The 19-year-old was alive when firefighters reached her at 8.15pm that night. She slipped away in a Memphis hospital the next day, with her mother by her bedside.

But months after Miss Chambers death, and despite a mammoth investigation, her murder remains unsolved.

'We just don't know where she was between 6.30pm and 7.30pm,' Mr Champion said yesterday. 'We're releasing this timeline in hopes it will generate some leads and memories. This case is obviously unusual for this area.' 

Mystery: Miss Chambers' Kia Rio sedan. She was found alive next to the vehicle just after 8pm

The crime scene: Investigators place her here by 7.30pm, but don't know what happened in the hour prior 

Miss Chambers' mother, Lisa Daugherty, has said her daughter went out at 5pm, after telling her she was going to buy food and clean her car.

After she was seen on cameral buying gas, Miss Chambers visited a home in Courtland, then drove the 10 minutes to nearby Batesville, where another video camera spotted her.

By 6.30pm, she was back in Courtland. An hour later she was at the scene where someone set her on fire.

'We've gotten leads on where she might have been and every one of them has been followed up on,' Mr Champion said. 'The problem is the one-hour gap.'  

Investigators have used witness statements, video camera footage and cell phone metadata to narrow down Miss Chambers' movements throughout the day.

'We're certainly using her cellphone records and using some technology we have available to pin some of this stuff down,' Mr Champion was quoted as saying by the Jackson Clarion Ledger. 

Despite a $54,000 reward for information no viable tips have been received, the paper reported, citing officials. Locals have reportedly said people are unwilling to come forward for fear they could be the next victim.

Investigators believe the killer is probably local.

Assistant US Attorney Chad Lamar said there is potential for a 'witness security program' to be made available to any informants. 

CCTV: Before she died, Jessica Chambers went to a gas station in Courtland to fill her car with gas

Last week Miss Chambers' mother revealed the final words she spoke to her daughter as she lay dying.

'I just looked at her and said, 'I know you're in pain, Baby, if you want to go, you can go.'

 Then, Ms Daugherty said, 'she took her last breath.'
