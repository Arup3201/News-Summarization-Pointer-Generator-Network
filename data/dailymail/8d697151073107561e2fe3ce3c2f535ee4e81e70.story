Judge Howard Crowson showed no sympathy when he was told Anthony Hall (pictured) had been injured when he attempted to commit a burglary

A burglar who was beaten up after breaking into a former rugby player's flat got what he deserved, a judge told him.

Anthony Hall was left bloodied and bruised when he tried to attack the homeowner who caught him attempting to steal his television in the middle of the night.

Jailing him, Judge Howard Crowson told the 22-year-old it was 'inevitable' he would be beaten up, adding: 'That's the risk you take.' Hall, a serial criminal, broke into Stephen Waterfield's home in Redcar, near Middlesbrough, in September.

Mr Waterfield, 48, woke at 12.30am to find Hall in his living room and confronted him. Hall tried to claim he was in the wrong house, saying he believed the property was his friend's.

He then lunged at Mr Waterfield, who is 6ft, 13½ stone and used to play at flanker for Redcar's rugby union team.

He instinctively defended himself as Hall bombarded him with kicks and punches, prosecutor David Crook told Teesside Crown Court. Mr Waterfield overpowered Hall and turned to find his phone to call police.

But the burglar kicked him in the face and tried to flee. 'Mr Waterfield managed to strike him from behind to try to detain him,' Mr Crook said. Hall, who fled empty-handed but was subsequently arrested, was left with two gashes to his head, a blackened left eye and a swollen cheek.

But Judge Crowson said he could not use his injuries in mitigation after he admitted burglary. Jailing Hall, of Newcastle upon Tyne, for three years and four months, he added: 'The police are never able to encourage members of the public to act in this way. But I'm afraid it is inevitable if someone like Mr Waterfield finds someone like you in his home, that something like this might happen.

'Having challenged you, he was effectively attacked by you. As it happens, he seems to have managed to inflict more injury on you, than you did him.'

Steve Waterfield, 48, the burly rugby player  fought back against burglar Anthony Hall when he found him in his home

Hall had attack the householder at his Jameson Ave, Redcar, flat but was overpowered and fled into the night empty handed

Structural engineer Mr Waterfield, who suffered a swollen arm and wrist as well as facial bruising, described Hall's sentence as a 'good deterrent'.

'I was glad that the judge took the point of view that he got what he deserved,' he said.

'An Englishman's home is his castle and he made a big mistake when he decided to come into mine. I think it's any homeowner's right to defend themselves and their property in the best way they can.'

Mr Waterfield said of his own injuries: 'I've had injuries on the rugby field that were a lot worse than anything he could have inflicted.' 

Tony Martin was convicted of manslaughter for killing burglar Fred Barras after he broke into his home

The most famous case of a homeowner defending himself against a burglar is that of Tony Martin.

In 1999, the Norfolk farmer  shot two burglars in the back after allegedly having his property raided on ten previous occasions.

Martin killed 16-year-old Fred Barras and seriously injured Brendan Fearon, then 28, with a shotgun after the pair broke into his farmhouse

He was first convicted of murder and later manslaughter following an appeal.

He was released from jail for good behaviour in 2003. 

Public outrage over the case was such that it finally prompted a change in the law to allow homeowners the power to use reasonable force' to defend themselves.
