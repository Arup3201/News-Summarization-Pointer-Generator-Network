A Dallas police officer involved in the shooting of a mentally ill man, that was caught on camera, has been fired.

Surveillance video shows Cardan Spencer was 20 feet away from paranoid schizophrenic Bobby Bennet when he shot him in the stomach.

The police officer and his partner had maintained their story: that they were forced to shoot after the man threatened their safety by lunging at the pair with a knife.

Officer Spencer has now been fired pending a criminal investigation after a neighbor released surveillance video capturing the incident that showed nothing documented in the police report actually happened.

Injured: Bennett is pictured falling to the ground after being shot by an officer who claimed he lunged at him

Mr Bennett never raised his arms nor moved forward to approach the officers, yet just 20 seconds after the officers arrived he was shot in the abdomen four times.

Bennett was charged with aggravated 
assault with a deadly weapon on a public servant, but Police Chief David
 Brown announced that the charges would be dropped.

Mr Bennett's mother, Joyce Jackson, said in an interview  that her 52-year-old son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and that he was off his medication at the time of the shooting.

Ms Jackson said she was arguing with 
Bennett when she called the police. She was told that officers who have 
been trained in dealing with the mentally ill would arrive to assist 
her.

The officers arrived outside her 
southeast Dallas home at about noon to find Mr Bennett sitting on a 
chair in the street holding a knife. At this point, accounts of the 
incident differ.

Officer Spencer wrote in a police report that Mr Bennett refused to drop the knife and moved towards him and another officer 'in a threatening manner'.

He said that was when he fired at Mr Bennett four times from about 20ft away, wounding him.

The police had no idea that they were being filmed by a neighbors surveillance camera and the footage tells a different story. Although the police report says Mr 
Bennett 'lunged' at the officers with a knife, in the video he stands up
 from the chair but then doesn't appear to move at all until the gun is 
fired and he falls to the ground.

The
 surveillance video doesn't include audio, and Officer Spencer wrote in 
his report that Mr Bennett yelled at them, 'You all are gonna need more 
officers than this!'

But it doesn't show that the incident 
'escalated, which led an officer to fire his weapon upon the 
individual', as police spokesman Warren Mitchell said in a statement a 
few hours after the shooting.

Officer Spencer's partner, Chris Watson, wrote in his police report that 'Bennet Stood Up and held the knife in his right hand

After being given verbal commands Watson wrote , 'Bennet took several steps towards us with the knife in a raised and aggressive manner.'

It was a blatant lie.

Police Chief David Brown has promised that Officer Spencer will be subjected to a 'thorough criminal investigation'. At a press conference Chief Brown all but apologized for his officers behavior.

'Officers are not above the law. We, as a police department, are not going to look the other way,' he said.George Milner, an attorney representing Bennett's family, spoke to reporters Thursday saying, 'What happened 10 days ago should have never have happened in the first place, and I want to make sure it never happens again.'

Milner says Bennett was shot in 'cold blood,' according to the station.

'I don't see how he could not be charged with a crime, Milner reportedly said of Spencer.

Ron Pinkston, the police union president, said a shooting investigation normally takes several months, but in Spencer's case was done in nine days 'because of the media and political pressure associated with it.'

'Spencer has a right to due process in a fair and impartial investigation,' Pinkston said. 'Because he's a police officer that right was taken away.'

Jackson's attorney, George Milner, said Brown had no choice but to fire Spencer in light of the video. He also questioned whether there was a 'deficiency in training' that prompted the shooting and said there may have been negligence on the part of the Police Department.

Officer Christopher Watson, who was with Spencer, is the subject of an internal police investigation, Brown said. Watson's explanation of the encounter with Bennett changed after he watched the video, Brown said.

Brown added that the shooting has prompted him to consider equipping all officers with body cameras.

Ms Jackson said she and her son had 
been arguing about whether he could take an ink drawing of a rose he had
 done for his late grandmother. The drawing is framed on the wall of her
 home.

The argument soon escalated to the point where Ms Jackson felt she needed police assistance.

'I'm devastated that I felt the need to call 911,' she said.

Ms Jackson said her son struggled 
with mental illness and often left her home to sleep on the streets, but
 said he is an avid artist and reader and isn't violent.

According to state criminal records, he was convicted of larceny, 
vehicle theft and forgery in the 1980s but has no recent arrests.

'I was expecting help from someone that's a lot more knowledgeable than me,' she said.

Mr
 Mitchell, the police spokesman, declined to say whether the two 
officers sent to Ms Jackson's home had any specific mental health 
training.

Ms Jackson, who 
was inside her home when she heard four gunshots, said it was a 
'miracle' that her neighbor's camera recorded the incident. Otherwise, 
'I wouldn't have had a leg to stand on,' she said.

Maurice Bunch installed the surveillance camera two years ago after a trailer was stolen from his driveway.

'The videotape just cries out for an independent investigation,' Bill Wirskye, a former high-ranking Dallas County prosecutor, told Dallas News.

'Maybe there’s something that’s not in the video that would justify the officer’s actions, but at least based on the videotape and the documentation that I’ve seen, it’s not a justified shooting.'

Bennett remains hospitalized in stable condition. He initially was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on a public servant, but Brown announced last week that the charge would be dropped.

Investigators interviewed Bennett in his hospital room last week and he told them he was suicidal at the time and wanted to be shot.
