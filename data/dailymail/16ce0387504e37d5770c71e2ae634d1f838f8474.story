Arriving at a reception for foster carers in Islington this morning, the Duchess of Cambridge was resplendent in a brown silk shirt-dress.

But while the frock might have looked a million dollars, its real price tag was a snip: £169 in the run-up to Christmas but now selling for just £50.

It came from what is fast becoming the Duchess' go-to label for everything from glamorous evening receptions to hot weather international tours - Hobbs.

Favourite label: The Duchess of Cambridge wore a discount £50 Hobbs shirt-dress for a visit to Islington

Not the first time: The British label, which is entirely designed in London, is a favourite

Once a die-hard fan of Zara, of late the Duchess has swapped the low-cost high street store for the more upmarket Hobbs, which sits alongside another budget favourite, L.K Bennett, in her wardrobe.

'The Duchess of Cambridge likes to play it quite safe when it comes to her wardrobe, pre and post baby and Hobbs is the perfect brand for her,' explains fashion pundit Simon Glazin.

'Not only is it uber British, with everything designed in-house in London, it also dovetails with royal fashion protocol: not too revealing, neutral colours, and affordable.' 

As well as today's outing, the Duchess wore a delicate polka dot velvet top by the brand for a Place2Be reception at Kensington Palace in November.

On that occasion, she deployed one of her favourite styling tricks and combined the budget top with a glamorous silk skirt by Jenny Packham for maximum sartorial effect.

Elegant: Earlier the same month, the Duchess wore a black dress by the brand during a visit to Wales

She had repeated the trick two months earlier when Kate, then just recovered from a bout of severe morning sickness, opted for a black dress by the label for a visit to the Valero Refinery in Pembrokeshire.

Partly hidden by her baby blue Matthew Williamson coat, it was yet another example of her ability to transform a high street frock into an upscale ensemble by mixing and matching her pieces. 

But although Wales, Kensington and Islington are the most recent outings, they are by no means the only ones for the Duchess' Hobbs wardrobe.

Most eye-catching was the recycled Hobbs dress, last seen in the run-up to London 2012, for a trip to Uluru with the result she looked both cool and practical in the baking desert heat.

The Wessex dress, which was worn by the Duchess to play ping pong at a London sports club, was a bargain when she bought it and had been discounted to a cut-price £35 in the brand's sale.

But the grey and white Wessex dress isn't the only Hobbs number to have been worn several times by the Duchess.

One of Kate's cupboard staples is a £369 brown wool coat, bought at a cut-price £182, which made its debut during a visit to Liverpool on Valentine's Day 2012.

Cool: She looked cool and polished in the belted dress, despite the Australian desert heat

First outing: The £35 dress was first worn to a London sports club in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics

Faithful friend: This £369 chestnut brown coat made its first appearance in Liverpool in 2012

Stylish: The coat was bought for a cut-price £182 and was styled with a black jumper on its first outing

Worn over a cosy black polo neck, the Duchess accessorised the piece with her favourite black opaque tights and court shoes combination, a trick that she repeated today in Islington.

A year later and Kate, by then pregnant with Prince George, was back in the same coat once more, this time for a trip to Grimsby.

Although six months pregnant, she had no problems stretching the coat over her bump and even managed to fasten the belt.

Hobbs also proved the label of choice for Kate's final public engagement ahead of Prince George's birth, with the 33-year-old opting for an eye-catching - and roomy - dalmatian-print coat.

The £169 coat was worn to launch cruise ship Royal Princess in Southampton and, like everything else she wears, promptly sold out. 

'Hobbs and the Duchess of Cambridge are a match made in heaven,' adds fashion expert Stephanie Hirschmiller.

'The label beloved by the Home Counties crew is a safe bet for the royal bump, a real go-to for classics and fashion without the inverted commas.'
