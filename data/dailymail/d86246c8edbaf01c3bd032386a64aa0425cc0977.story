Business Secretary Vince Cable said internet firms had to do more to police what people could search for and view online

Senior politicians and child welfare  campaigners have demanded Google show ‘moral
leadership’ and block child porn.

As research revealed one in six men who view the vile sites
go on to abuse children, Vince Cable last night broke ranks to become the first
minister to call on the internet giant to do more to restrict access. 

His intervention came as John Carr, a leading adviser on
online child safety, said there were 
simple measures that search engines could take to make it harder for
paedophiles to find illegal pictures.

Mr Carr, of Children’s Charities Coalition on Internet
Safety, said: ‘If you stop them viewing child porn, you stop much of the
physical abuse as a result.

'Google’s moral leadership is essential here. They
are the biggest player in this space in the world.

'They can and should be
proactive – if they did it, I think others would have to follow.’

Mark Bridger, who was jailed for life on Thursday, collected
a ‘library’ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on Google and
Microsoft’s Bing in the weeks before he abducted and murdered five-year-old April
Jones.

Both he and Stuart Hazell, who murdered 12-year-old Tia Sharp, had no
previous convictions for sexual offences and progressed from viewing child porn
on the internet to committing child murder.

Business Secretary Mr Cable said yesterday: ‘Mark Bridger
appears to have been influenced by watching child pornography on the internet.

‘Where there is some scope for taking action is getting the
companies that host these sites, Google and the rest of it, to be more
proactive in policing what is there.’

There was no response from Conservative ministers as critics
pointed to the party’s close links with Google.

Shadow media minister Helen Goodman said:
‘Search engines and other technology companies need to be more proactive in
preventing access to child pornography.

The industry should be making safe searches the default. If
technology companies are unable to make progress by a set date, we need to see
action from the Government.’

Tory MP Claire Perry, who is David Cameron’s adviser on
parenting and childhood, said: ‘This is a hugely complex problem and there is
no magic bullet, but government, industry and internet users have got to do
more to avert more of these terrible crimes.

However, Mr Carr claimed search engines were reluctant to
act because any access restrictions could lose them millions of users, causing
advertising revenue to fall.

Experts say Google can combat abuse by paedophiles by simply
popping up messages when users type in search terms such as ‘teen sex’ or
‘barely legal’, warning them that they may be about to access illegal material.

People who view child porn, who thrive on anonymity, may be frightened into
going no further, they claim.

Mr Carr also suggests search engines should reset their
default search setting to the safest option, which would automatically block
access to all hardcore pornography.

To view these sites users would have to set
up a personal account with Google.

He added: ‘They could at that point ask them to verify that
they are 18 or above. That would be a huge deterrent for many of these guys.

'That would stop them getting on the pathway that led to the child abuse images.

‘This is not an attack on free speech, this is not
censorship. It is about making child pornography less easily available.

'Pornography has always been around but Google has made it available on a scale
never seen before.’

Mr Carr, who plans to confront Google at a forthcoming
meeting and raise the subject at the next gathering of the Government’s
internet task force, said while the site does not run adverts from
pornographers, bosses may be concerned that blocking porn would mean ‘people
would go to other search engines and this would affect revenue’.

He pointed to a British study from 2007, which found a
‘substantial minority’ of those who watch child porn go on to attack children.

David Middleton, of De Montfort University, analysed 213
online offenders and 191 paedophiles who had physically abused children.

‘The
majority of people [who watch child porn] don’t appear to escalate their
behaviour. But a substantial minority do,’ Professor Middleton said.

‘Various
studies have looked at this and put it somewhere between one in six and one in
ten.’

Over the past month, Mold Crown Court heard how Bridger
murdered April after becoming obsessed with online child porn.

Internet giant: Google says that it operates a 'zero tolerance' policy towards child porn

He found shockingly violent images by searching on Google
and Bing for simple terms, including: ‘Naked young five-year-old girls’,
‘nudism five-year-old’ and ‘pictures of naked virgin teens’.

Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select
committee, said online images of child sex abuse needed to be removed. Jim
Sheridan, who sits on the culture committee, added: ‘I know it’s extremely
difficult to ban it (but) I think with the political will and the technology,
if you can do it, we should be doing it.’

Phillip Noyes, acting chief executive of the NSPCC, said:
‘For some time we have been concerned about the growing number of these obscene
images which are becoming more easily available and can fuel the fantasies of
offenders like Bridger.’

Google insisted it does all it can to prevent child
pornography coming up on searches, adding that it employs a ‘zero tolerance
policy on child sexual abuse content’.

Spokesman Scott Rubin said: ‘We work with organisations to
proactively find this material, so while safe search might filter this out we
think it is important to go beyond that and we do that all the time. Any
implication that we don’t is simply wrong.’

Asked what they do if they find such sites, he added: ‘We
immediately remove it and report it to appropriate legal authorities.’
