'I lost my bearings': Vladimir Martynenko, whose snow plough clipped the wheel of a private jet taking off in Moscow on Monday, causing it to crash

The driver of the snowplough in the Moscow plane crash which killed French oilman Christophe de Margerie and three crew has admitted straying onto the runway after losing his bearings.

Vladimir Martynenko's lawyer also acknowledged the 60-year-old may have consumed a 'remedy' which included 'a few drops' of alcohol after yesterday angrily denying official claims his client was 'drunk'.

In video testimony, the grey haired driver stated: 'When I lost my bearings, I myself didn't notice when I drove onto the runway.'

Mr de Margerie, the 63-year-old boss of French oil giant Total, was killed alongside the three crew of his Falcon business jet when the aircraft exploded into a fireball at Vnukovo Airport.

It was also revealed today that a 'girl trainee' air traffic controller gave the signal to the doomed business jet that it was clear to take off - moments before it hit Martynenko's snowplough.

The unnamed controller was being supervised at the time by a senior colleague called Alexander Kruglov, said a source at Vnukovo airport.

Kruglov, 40, is an experienced air traffic controller who famously averted a serious crash in 2007 by halting a Tu-204 takeoff when he noticed flames coming from the plane.

The revelations came amid suspicions of an official campaign to gag Martynenkov's lawyer and family - who deny he was 'drunk' at the time of the crash - from highlighting alleged blunders by airport controllers.

In particular, his lawyer argued that the controller should have seen that his vehicle was on the runway when the Falcon was permitted to start its takeoff, but other disturbing claims have also come to light.

Martynenko is expected to face a Moscow court today when a judge will be asked to approve his formal arrest.

'The plane was running up to takeoff and I practically couldn't see it because my equipment was on. There weren't even any lights, nothing,' he said, with a shrug.

'I didn't see it, and the collision happened.'

It was not clear if he meant the lights on the runway or the plane or on his vehicle. The crash was at several minutes before midnight on Monday.

A report by newspaper Izvestia appeared to confirm speculation that an inexperienced air traffic controller was involved.

'The aircraft's actions were really run by girl trainee,' said a source at Vnukovo airport. 'The instructor actually controls all the actions of the trainee,' and can intervene at any time.

'In addition, there is also a flight director who supervises the work of air traffic controllers,' said the unnamed source. 'However, in the case of the Falcon crashed at Vnukovo air traffic controllers were not able to do anything.'

Another insider said: 'No one could see the vehicle. There was strong fog.'

But this source complained the 'quality of display equipment' was 'very poor'.

'As a result, when the vehicle moved out onto the runway unauthorised, it was not seen.'

The snowplough driver was supposed to listen to radio communications between the tower and plane and 'had to hear' if a plane was given the go-ahead to takeoff, it was claimed.

Fellow workers at Vnukovo have disputed the claim Martynenko was drunk, but there was a suggestion today that he consumed 'coffee with liquor' shortly before the crash.

Investigators warned that senior officials at the airport bore ultimate responsibility for errors by ground staff, arguing 'criminal negligence' was involved.

Experts were today obtaining information from the plane's black boxes.

'The information extracted from cockpit voice recorder will be sent for transcription and voice identification. The data from flight data recorder will be deciphered and submitted to technical experts,' said Sergei Zaiko, deputy chairman of the Moscow-based Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK).

Meanwhile, lawyers for Martynenko claimed that their attempts to hold a press conference have been stonewalled by a number of pro-Kremlin media organisations.

A report by Ekho Moscow radio said: 'A news conference by Martynenkov's lawyer and his wife and son was scheduled to take place at the offices of the Argumenty i Fakty weekly.

'However, it was cancelled for technical reasons without any details given, says RBK [business daily].

'No agreement could be reached with Moskovskiy Komsomolets [daily] either, the lawyer representing the snowplough driver told Ekho Moscow.

'Requests were sent to a couple of other places: at first they agreed, but then called back and refused.'

Alexander Karabanov, Martynenko's lawyer, later told the station he has not been given the name of the air-traffic controller on duty. He also claimed that he was denied access to his client soon after the crash.

He fears that in the 20 hours Martynenko spent in custody alone he was forced to sign documents without his lawyer present. 

'I realise that right now we are in situation of conflict of interest between the airport and the driver, because if the investigation finds out that the fault was on the airport's air traffic controller, there is the prospect of millions worth of legal actions,' he said.

'My client is a very convenient figure from this point of view. If he is found guilty the threat of legal actions and losses is far smaller. We understand we will be fighting company with huge administrative and financial resources.'

He claimed a subtle change has been made in the name of the company employing Martynenko in a possible bid to distance it from the airport.

Until yesterday it was called called ZAO 'Aeroservice'. Today it is known as OOO 'Aero-service'. The first is a closed joint stock company, the second is a public corporation.

'On other strange moments in this investigation, we still don't have name of chief engineer whose duty was to look after snow ploughing brigade,' he said.

'Martynenko is just an ordinary driver, he had no access to overall picture of what's been happening at the airport at that point.'

'He is in a state of shock, even though visually there is not a single scratch on him. I have requested medical check up to see if he might have brain concussion or internal damages.

'He can't put together his actions with what happened... 'I don't understand what happened, I was following my route', he keeps saying.' 

Mr Karabanov earlier told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: 'We still have not seen the documents on the medical examination of Martynenko.

'I can imagine that they do not exist. Probably, the investigators could conclude that there was 'intoxication', based on Vladimir's diction and behaviour and reported it to their superiors.

'But the man was in shock. He was almost killed.'

Alexander Karabanov, Martynenko's lawyer: He said he believes there was no medical carried out on his client that could definitively prove he was drunk

Mr Karabanov added: 'Vladimir is a simple man. He is the most basic technical performer. He has no understanding of what is happening in the air and on the ground.

'Even if we assume that Martynenko was lost in the fog, he did not go there of his own initiative.

'He was sent by people who should have known that the Falcon was preparing for take-off.

'There are internal rules, according to which the air traffic controller has full responsibility for everything that happens in the air and on the ground.

'Even if we assume that Martynenko lost landmarks as a result of weather conditions, it is the dispatcher who had to control him, direct his routes.'

Martynenko's son, Roman, said: 'My father never complained. It's his job. He does not do any dirty tricks. Just worked honestly, and that's all.

'He served in the army, worked as a driver, a crane operator. For a while, he led a garage cooperative. And this work in Vnukovo - in fact he was paid very little there.

'But it was important to him - to do something, to work. Just not to sit at home. He and my mother still do not want to retire.'

Respected political analyst and editor Yevgenia Albats said today that the crash could signal the 'beginning of collapse' for Vladimir Putin's system of government.

'How could it happen that a snowplough was on the runway? How could it happen that the plane was allowed to go along the runway and hit this snowplough? It is very symbolic,' she said.

Such 'chaos' will stop business from coming to Russia, she warned.

'They can't get rid of the chaos here. Chaos on the runway.

'It is such a symbolic thing that I strongly feel it is the beginning of collapse.'
