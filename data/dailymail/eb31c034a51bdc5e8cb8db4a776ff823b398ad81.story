Stuart Lancaster hailed Sam Burgess’s ‘winning attitude’ as the rugby-league convert played a full part in a feisty England training session on Wednesday ahead of this Saturday’s Calcutta Cup clash.

Burgess, who signed for Bath from the South Sydney Rabbitohs last year, has joined Lancaster’s squad to gain more experience of his new code in the hope he can be fast-tracked into England's World Cup training camp this summer.

Lancaster earlier this week ruled out any possibility of Burgess featuring against Scotland - and on Wednesday afternoon named his starting XV which sees recalls for Mike Brown and Courtney Lawes – but admitted he has been impressed by the 18 stone centre’s contribution.

‘It’s the first time I’ve coached him,’ Lancaster said. ‘He played in the Saxons game (against Ireland in February) for which I was an observer but not coaching in.

‘He came in after that game for camp but was injured and didn’t train. I’ve been impressed by just how quickly he’s picked things up. 

'Clearly there’s a new calling system for him to work with. He’s got a very good manner about him and clearly he’s got a physical presence.

‘We talked yesterday and he was one of the first contributors to talk about what it takes to win. That winner’s attitude is something you need in your team.

‘Whether he can have enough time to learn the game and challenge for a World Cup place we will have to wait and see. But he’s certainly got that winner’s attitude and that’s an important quality to have.’

Lancaster put his squad through a 15-a-side training session at their Pennyhill Park base and, with George Kruis, Alex Goode and Nick Easter omitted from the squad that lost to Ireland, the England coach was encouraged by the ferocity on show.

‘You can describe it as a backlash or whatever you want but we had 15 v 15 training today and I had to calm it down,’ Lancaster said. ‘You have 15 people who want to be in the starting 15 and it was me blowing the whistle in the end to make sure we didn’t play the game too early.’
