Arsenal are bracing themselves for a battle with the Home Office as they look to seal a move for Gabriel Paulista.

The Gunners were on Wednesday close to agreeing a deal with Villareal for the central defender, who has a £15million release clause.

But the biggest stumbling block towards a deal will be securing the Brazilian a work permit.

The 24-year-old has not played a senior match for his country, and hence will have great difficulty in obtaining a work permit.

However, Arsenal are set to appeal any such decision in their attempts to land Paulista this month.

Should the FA, who rule on behalf of the Home Office in such cases, refuse to grant the defender the necessary paperwork to play in the UK, the Gunners will then have to prove Paulista is an 'exceptional talent' in their bid to land him a permit.

This will be easier said than done, however, given the Paulista has not played for Brazil.

Rules state that only players who have played 75 percent of matches for a nation inside FIFA's top 70 within the past two years are eligible for work permits.

Arsenal's attempts to secure the green light for Paulista to play in this country will make interesting viewing for the club's rivals.

Seemingly, given the South American falls short of meeting the Home Office's criteria, other clubs would have reason to be perplexed should Paulista be granted permission to play in the Premier League.

However, the Gunners could use Leicester's recent signing of Andrej Kramaric as precedent in an appeal process.

There were major doubts over Leicester's capture of Kramaric earlier this month given he has just four caps for Croatia to his name. But the Foxes successfully argued to the FA that Kramaric was of 'exceptional talent' and eventually saw Wembley chiefs endorse their application.
