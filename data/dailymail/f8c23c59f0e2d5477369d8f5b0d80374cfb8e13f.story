The multi-millionaire founder and bassist of heavy metal band Iron Maiden is selling his Essex rock star mansion which includes its own pub called the Horse and Cart.

Steve Harris's £6.75million house also has an indoor swimming pool surrounded with garish murals of voluptuous women, vikings and Gothic pictures on the walls, which wouldn't be out of place on one of the band's horror album covers.

Outside there is an old-fashioned red telephone box, floodlit tennis court and a full-sized football pitch with home and away changing rooms. 

For sale: Iron Maiden bassist Steve Harris has put his mansion in Sheering, near Harlow, Essex, up for sale for £6.75 million

In action: Steve Harris is well known for his love of the football team West Ham and has their badge on his guitar - pictured left while playing with Iron Maiden at Sonisphere in 2010.  Harris has five children and is pictured right with his daughter Lauren backstage at the Lokomotiv Stadium  in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2007

Football mad: The West Ham fanatic also created a full-sized football pitch in the grounds of the property with home and away changing rooms

The seven-bed mansion in Sheering, near Harlow, is described as an 'outstanding country house in a highly sought-after area' with parts of the current structure dating back to 1427 and records of a property on the site mentioned in the Domesday Book.

The property, which is on the market through Hamptons International, is a mixture of old and new with its own arcade games lounge, music studio, media room and koi carp pond plus old fashioned, wood-panelled rooms which have to stay because of its grade II listed status.

On some of the walls are Harris's gold discs won through his 38-year career with Iron Maiden - one of Britain's top heavy metal bands.

Harris first founded the group in east London in 1975 and they've gone on to release 15 albums and sell 85 million records.

The self-taught guitarist wrote many of the band's songs - including their latest, The Final Frontier, which has made it to No.1 in 28 countries - and is reputed to be worth £28million.

Fancy a pint? The property comes with its very own pub called the Horse and Cart

All the necessary luxuries: The mansion comes with its own indoor swimming pool which is surrounded by Gothic art - and some naked women - painted on the walls

Match point: The country house also has a tennis court with flood lighting so residents can practise their serve at any time

Variety: Much of the properly has original wood panelling and beams in stark contrast to the mod cons in the house such as a music room and games lounge

He is the only member of Iron Maiden 
to have remained in the band since their inception and, along with 
guitarist Dave Murray, to have appeared on all of their albums.

Other
members have come and gone, and then returned back to the band - such 
as Bruce Dickinson who is also a qualified airline pilot and often flies
the band's chartered Boeing 757, dubbed 'Ed Force One', which has been 
specially designed to carry their equipment between continents.

As well as their music, the band are 
well-known for their album cover artwork and mascot Eddie the Head who 
appears on nearly all them.

Long-haired Harris, 56, who released his
first solo album last year called British Lion, is said to be selling 
up because he now spends too much time abroad.

Harris had four children with his ex-wife Lorraine - Lauren, Kerry, Faye and George - and two more children - Stanley and Maisie - with his current partner Emma.

He was unavailable for comment.

Memorabilia: Awards and gold discs won by Steve Harris during his 38-year-long career decorate the walls of many rooms in the mansion

Piece of history: The property, which has a unique combination of old and new, is Grade II listed with parts of the building dating back to 1427

A look into the past: There are records of a property existing on the same site in the Doomsday Book
