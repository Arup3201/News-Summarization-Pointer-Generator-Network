A 26-year-old Colorado man has pleaded guilty to causing the death of his ex-girlfriend's toddler son after beating the child so aggressively that his intestines ruptured.

Justin Keel faces 24 to 36 years in prison for child abuse resulting in the death of 19-month-old Owen Reak, who passed away on April 11 of internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to his abdomen.

Social services had investigated reported abuse at the home just 19 days before Owen's death, after he was rushed to hospital with a broken leg while in Keel's care. Keel claimed the boy's leg got stuck in his high chair and the child was allowed to continue living with his mother, Amber Reak, and Keel.

Reak, who was in the process of obtaining a divorce from Owen's father, agreed that she wouldn't leave the child alone in Keel's care again.

But less than three weeks later, Owen suffered fatal injuries at the hands of the man, while his mother was in the shower.

According to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, Reak said she heard two 'booms' while she was in the bathroom on the morning of April 10.

She found Keel holding the boy who he described as being 'fussy' after falling off his bed.

Keel initially denied hurting the 
child to authorities and later claimed his dog, a boxer named Rusty, could have been 
responsible for the Owen's injuries.

After the incident, the couple dropped the boy off at daycare at around 10.30am. But shortly after, the daycare provider, who happened to be Reak's father Jim Milligan, called and insisted Owen be taken to hospital.

Doctors at Community Hospital in Grand Junction gave him an X-ray but said everything looked OK and that he likely had a stomach flu.

Owen eventually succumbed to his 
injuries while sleeping that night at his grandparents home.

According to the Daily Sentinel, his grandparents said Owen appeared sick and kept a close eye on him the night of April 10 after he wouldn't eat, had been throwing up and 'appeared in abdominal pain.' They also noted 
bruises around his face.

They last checked on him around 1:30am on April 11, and the child was breathing at the time. But at around 4am they called 911 and reported Owen was cold to the touch and stiff in his crib.

A forensic pathologist later determined that Owen's internal bleeding may have been missed 'if the X-rays were done shortly after the time of injury,' according to The Denver Post.

The pathologist said the injuries could have been caused by someone punching or kicking the child's stomach, or being struck with an object.

On Tuesday, Keel pleaded guilty to child abuse resulting in death after prosecutors added a first-degree murder charge to his list of charges. If convicted of the murder charge, Keel could have been sentenced to life without parole.

The charge Keel pleaded guilty to 
referred to abuse stretching for about six weeks, from the beginning of 
March to the day Owen died.

He will be sentenced on February 15.
