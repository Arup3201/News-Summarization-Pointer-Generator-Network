Koppenhaver has not come forward but he has tweeted about the incident.

'@ChristyMack I love you and hope you're okay. I came him (sic) early to surprise you and help you set up for your convention. I can't believe what I found and can't believe what happened.

'I'm so heart broken...in all ways. I will always love you.'

TMZ reports that Mack is 'in very bad shape' after the attack and can barely speak from her injuries.

A representative for the porn actress told TMZ that Mack's friends and relatives are offering a $5,000 reward to anyone who can provide clues as to Koppenhaver's whereabouts.

Welterweight Koppenhaver, who appears on the FOX show Ultimate Fighter, has been released from his contract with MMA tournament group Bellator.

Bellator's president told TMZ that Koppenhaver would not be welcome back.

'We have a zero tolerance policy here at Bellator when it relates to any form of domestic violence, and after learning of this latest incident involving (Jon Koppenhaver) War Machine, Bellator is releasing him from his promotional contract with the organization,' Bellator president Scott Coker told TMZ.

Koppenhaver served a year in jail in 2012 for an assault in a San Diego nightclub.

Mack has previously tweeted about her boyfriend's violent tendency.

Fox Sports reports that last November she wrote that Koppenhaver 'threatened to kill' her.

She deleted the tweets not long after and Koppenhaver tweeted that she had been joking.

Later, she tweeted that she had endured 'several slapping, choking unconscious, smothering, kicking and throwings' at his hands.
