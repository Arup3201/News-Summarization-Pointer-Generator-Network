The younger brother of Kings Cross nightclub identity John Ibrahim is back behind bars for breaching parole conditions, nearly two weeks after being shot near his home in Sydney's CBD. 

Convicted killer Michael Ibrahim was shot in the shoulder after bullets were fired at him in Macquarie Street in Sydney's CBD on January 4. in August last year he was released from jail  with twelve months still to serve of a nine-year sentence for the manslaughter of Robin Nassour at Chiswick in Sydney's inner west in 2006.

However, ABC News reported that the New South Wales Parole Authority said Ibrahim had breached a non-association condition of his parole order and was on his way back to jail.

On January 4 at around 10.30pm Michael Ibrahim suffered a gunshot wound to the shoulder after bullets were fired at him outside his Macquarie Street home on one of Sydney's most prestigious strip of apartments.

Police had initially investigated whether the shooting was linked to a feud between the Ibrahims and other notorious criminal families. But no motive has yet been found for the attack.

At 36 years old he is the youngest of the family and was jailed for the killing of Robin Nassour in 2006, but was released on parole in August last year.

He was released after serving more than seven-and-a-half years for his role in the fatal stabbing.

At his August 2014 parole hearing Michael Ibrahim vowed to move on with his life.

He told the board he wouldn't break the law if released from jail and would abide by the ‘most stringent’ parole conditions.

Being behind bars while his mother was treated for cancer was a 'wake up call', he told the parole board.

He was granted parole, reportedly subject to a range of strict conditions, including electronic monitoring and keeping away from Kings Cross and other parts of Sydney. However, now he is back in prison.

Michael's brother John Ibrahim, 44, is known as the ‘King of the Cross’, for the number of establishments he owns in the nightclub district, and has never been convicted of a serious offence.

However, in 2004, a police bail submission presented to court on a charge of threatening a witness described Ibrahim as ‘a major organised crime figure’ who was ‘the subject of 546 police intelligence reports in relation to his involvement in drugs, organised crime and association with outlaw motorcycle gangs’.

His life is apparently now the basis for a new $15 million TV series.
