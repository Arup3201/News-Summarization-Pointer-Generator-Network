The South Korean ferry that overturned last month killing 269 people was caused by excessive cargo, it has been reported.

The news comes just a day after officials confirmed a civilian diver helping to recover trapped bodies in the wreckage died after losing communication with the task force.

The Sewol ferry was carrying 467 passengers and crew, including more than 300 high school students on a school trip when it capsized on April 16.

Investigators believe that the Sewol ferry, pictured, capsized last month as the ship was carrying excess cargo

According to the country’s coastguard, 35 people are still missing.

Now it is thought that authorities believe the cargo aboard the vessel was double the ship’s limit and wasn’t tied down correctly.

Senior prosecutor Yang Joong-jin told CNN: ‘The lashing devices that should have held cargo goods steady were loose, and some of the crew members did not even know how to use them correctly.’

A joint investigation by South Korean Police and a prosecuting team also believe that it wasn’t the first time that the ferry had excess cargo adding that the Sewol carried more cargo than it should have 139 times on the Incheon to Jeju route since March 2013.

Four employees of the ferry's owner, Cheonghaejin Marine Co., have already been indicted over the last two weeks, including a senior executive.

Recovery teams are still searching for the bodies of people who are unaccounted for and yesterday, a diver involved in the search died.

The civilian diver, named as Lee Kwang-wook, died in hospital after becoming unconscious following searches off the southern cost of South Korea, where the Sewol sank.

Some task force team officials say the 53-year-old diver was pulled to the surface by fellow divers after losing communication.

Searches for bodies have been hampered by strong currents and floating debris inside the ship.

Today, the South Korean prime minister called for underwater searches to be completed by the weekend.

Chung Hong-won told a cabinet council meeting that workers must ‘resolve to finish searches’ by Saturday as tidal currents are forecast to be weak until then.

The slow searches have deepened the anguish of families of missing people, who have been camping out at a nearby port waiting for the news of their loved ones.

Last the weekend, South Korean President Park Geun-hye visited the port where the rescue operation is based to console families and encourage divers.

It has been reported that mattresses and clothing from the ship have been found up to nine miles away from the accident site.

Trawler nets were being set up to catch any items that may float away from the ship.
