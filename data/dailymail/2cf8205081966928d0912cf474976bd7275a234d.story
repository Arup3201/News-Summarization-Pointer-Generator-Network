Noah Kagan was employee number 30 at Facebook but was fired after only eight months in the role

A 23-year-old Mark Zuckerberg used to walk around the Facebook offices with a samurai sword pretending to threaten employees if they produced bad work, it has been claimed.

The revelation, along with the claim an angry Zuckerberg threw water all over an engineer's computer, is made in former Facebook employee Noah Kagan's new ebook.

Kagan was the employee famously fired eight months into his stint at Facebook just as it became a global sensation.

It occurred before his stock options had vested and is estimated to have cost him $100million.

In his book, according to Business Insider, Kagan claims a 23-year-old Zuckerberg would walk through the offices carrying a samurai sword, pretending to attack employees if they produced bad work.

'He’d come around and pretend to cut you, joking if you take down the site he’ll chop your head off.

'You have to remember you have a 23-year old uber nerd running one of the fastest growing sites on the web.

'As mature as he could be he also was still immature.'

During another incident, Zuckerberg allegedly threw water all over an engineer's computer after his work was not up to scratch.

The younger Zuckerberg's abrasive and socially awkward style of management was detailed in the 2010 movie The Social Network. However, he appears to have made amends - last year he was ranked the most popular CEO in the world.

Although Kagan missed out on a fortune when he was fired from Facebook, he has since gone on to found several other successful companies.

Four years ago he created AppSumo, a daily deals website which specializes in digital goods for the apps market.

Kagan, who is still running AppSumo, was the 30th employee at Facebook when he was hired by founder Zuckerberg as a product manager.

Even though he estimated he could have earned $100million if he had remained at the company, he has said he has no regrets.

Having worked at web firms such as Mint.com and KickFlip before starting AppSumo, he says of his departure from Facebook: 'It is what it is.

'Ultimately, I appreciate where I am now and all the experiences I got from not being there.'
