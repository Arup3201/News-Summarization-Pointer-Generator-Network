Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard has promised that he will move to New York City FC at the end of the Premier League season.

Lampard, 36, was due to move to the MLS on January 1 but his impressive form for Manchester City led the English club to force though an agreement with their sister club in the United States.

New York City announced last summer that Lampard had signed a two-year contract but he has now described it as a 'commitment'.

He had originally been set to join New York Ciy in time for the beginning of the MLS season in March and it has led to a furious reaction in the States, where supporters believe they were misled.

Writing on his Facebook page, Lampard said: 'I want to make it completely clear as I have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days.

'When released from Chelsea last year at the end of my contract I signed a commitment to play in NYC FC for two years starting January 1, 2015.

'I was then offered the chance to train and be part of the Man City squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into New York.

'This period has since been extended by Man City and I now will start playing for NYC FC at the end of this current Premier League season.

'There has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone.

'I can say that I am very excited about arriving in New York and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the MLS as soon as possible.'

Liverpool legend Steve Nicol has led the chorus of disapproval in the United States after Lampard delayed his move.

Nicol, who was the coach of fellow MLS side New England Revolution until 2011, told ESPN on New Year's Day: 'It is a disaster for that new franchise, a disaster for the MLS.'

The 36-year-old midfielder has scored seven goals since joining Manchester City

I want to make it completely clear about my situation as I have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days. 

When released from Chelsea last year at the end of my contract I signed a commitment to play in NYC FC for two years starting January 1 2015. I was then offered the chance to train and be part of the Man City squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into New York.

This period has since been extended by Man City and I now will start playing for NYC FC at the end of this current Premier League season. There has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone.

I can say that I am very excited about arriving in New York and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the MLS as soon as possible. 

Thanks everyone for your ongoing support and I wish everyone a healthy and happy 2015!
