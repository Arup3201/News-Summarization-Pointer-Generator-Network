An OAP 'nightmare neighbour' has been evicted after she threw her china plates at her 83-year-old neighbour.

Violet Skinner, 77, waged an eight-year campaign of harassment against Joseph Doyle and his wife Ragnfrid, 78, and tried to use a garden hose to soak their beloved hardwood floors.

In a fit of anger the pensioner even hurled her best Royal Worcester dinner plates at the couple.

In the past Mrs Skinner has been hauled before the courts for trashing her neighbours fence and screaming abuse at them when she was 'paralytic’ on home-brewed 'hooch'.

The same year the neighbours almost came to blows when Mrs Skinner threw stones at Mr Doyle’s car when he complained about her noisy cockerel.

The pensioner, who lives alone with four cats, has also been accused of assaulting police officers and council staff.

Yesterday the retired horticulturalist who denies any wrong doing, was told she has just 28 days to pack her things and move out of her bungalow, in Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire.

Father-of-five Mr Doyle described his relief at learning his nuisance neighbour was finally being forced to leave - as Mrs Skinner threatened to move into a camper van on their street.

He said: 'It’s been an absolute nightmare - I feel sorry for her and have some sympathy for a woman of her age being evicted but she brought it on herself.

'I don’t know anybody in the world who could live next door to her.'

Mrs Doyle said: 'I’m so happy - I’ve got no pity for her, no sympathy, I just can’t wait until the day when she is gone.'

The feud started when Mrs Skinner moved next door to Mr and Mrs Doyle in 2004, after the trio had started out as friends.

But rows over snide comments, damage to their partition fence and Mrs Skinner’s noisy cockerel soured their relationship.

In 2009 Cambridge Magistrates’ Court heard Skinner threatened to kill Mr Doyle and threw stones at his car after a dispute.

Mr Doyle told the court Skinner aimed a hose at him and his wife as they left their house in a bid to soak their hardwood floors.

Skinner denied it, but was found guilty of criminal damage by magistrates.

South Cambridgeshire District Council say Skinner has even assaulted police and local authority workers.

A council spokesman said: 'Mrs Skinner has a substantial and serious history of anti-social behaviour, including damage and physical attacks on her neighbours, our staff and the police'.

Skinner still denies any wrongdoing and says the decision to evict her willforce her to have to live in a camper van.

She said: 'It’s wicked and evil because none of what is said is true and none of it is my fault but I’m the one with the blame and who has to get out.'

At Skinner’s court appearance for criminal damage inflicted on her neighbours’ fence, in 2009, magistrates heard she had made false accusations to police about the Doyles more than 50 times in five years.

The court heard angry Mrs Skinner had chopped branches off a tree in her garden and shoved them through his garden trellis - ruining it.

That evening, Mrs Skinner then hurled Royal Worcester dinner plates over the garden fence and smashed them against the Doyles’ house, Mr Doyle claimed.

He described life next door to Mrs Skinner as 'terrible, absolutely dreadful'and said his wife, Ragnfrid, had become a 'nervous wreck' because she was frightened of Skinner.

Mrs Skinner denied any aggression against Mr Doyle and also denied criminal damage.

She told the court: 'For some reason he hates me. All he ever does all daylong is to see how he can rile me.'

She claimed Mr Doyle had once said to her: 'I see you haven’t paid your bills recently.

'I see you’re still taking the ugly pills.'

Magistrates found Mrs Skinner guilty of criminal damage, handing her a 12-month conditional discharge and £100 costs.

Bizarrely the relationship had started as a friendship, with Mr Doyle’s wife,Ragnfrid, helping Mrs Skinner after a hospital stay.

Mrs Skinner has previously said: 'I do like him. I just wish he could be afriend again.'
