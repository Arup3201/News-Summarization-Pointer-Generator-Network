Aurimas Medvedevas, 23, has been jailed for a minimum of 22 years for murdering his nine-week-old daughter, Aukse 

A father who murdered his nine-week-old daughter by biting her forehead and launching her against a wall in a 'brutality that defies belief' has been jailed for life.

Aurimas Medvedevas, 23, left little Aukse to die in agony in her cot for up to six hours after beating her to death at the family home in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

The savage attack took place in September last year, on the first day Aukse's mother had returned to work since giving birth.

The Lithuanian delivery driver left his child with a catalogue of shocking injuries, including a bite on her forehead.

The baby was also left with internal bleeding, head injuries, five fractured ribs and a lacerated liver due to being violently shaken and thrown against a hard surface before her death.

Today, Medvedevas was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years after being convicted at the Old Bailey last week of murder.

He had previously denied the charge, claiming his daughter had died accidentally by falling out of bed. He changed his plea to guilty two days into his trial. 

Dzesika Urbikaite, 22, the child's mother, wept in court today as Judge Timothy Pontius told the court that baby Aukse suffered considerably for hours before her eventual death.

He said the circumstances 'demonstrated a callousness that is as incredible as it is inhuman'. 

He said: 'The murder of any human being is always a tragedy, the murder of a defenceless child of any age, the more so.

'The murder of a helpless infant only a few weeks old in circumstances of brutality which almost defy belief is an appalling crime beyond comprehension.' 

He went on: 'This defendant has, albeit belatedly, accepted that he can't pretend with any chance at all that he can fool a jury that he didn't intend to cause harm to his daughter, when he gripped her, shook her aggressively, and threw her against a hard surface. This caused serious eye and brain injuries. 

'The responsibility - his alone - for so horrific a crime will, I imagine, weigh heavily upon his conscience for the rest of his life and so it should. The extent and nature of the injuries set out are clearly shocking.’ 

The court had previously heard how Ms Urbikaite, an agency worker, had returned to the house she shared with Medvedevas  to find their daughter dead in her cot.

She rushed the youngster to hospital but doctors were unable to revive her. She was pronounced dead the same evening. 

Defence lawyer Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC told the court that Medvedevas had shown 'heartfelt' remorse for what he had done to his own daughter.

She said: 'The horror of having realised that his child was badly hurt will never leave this young man. What he does recall is holding her.

'He recalls she died in his arms and afterwards he was terrified as to the hurt he had inflicted on her and his girlfriend who he loved very much. He was in a state of utter terror and hurt.'

She said the defendant was a 'loving and caring' man who had suffered a 'clear mental disturbance'.

At the time of the murder he was struggling to find work and 'matters were really at quite a desperate state' financially, she said. 

Jurors had previously been told how Medvedevas had denied causing the fatal injuries when questionned by police, but that he gave no explanation about how they were caused.

He later claimed that Aukse had fallen off the bed and hit her head while he was asleep.

Then, on the day his trial was due to start in May, he produced a radically different account, accepting for the first time that he caused the injuries, the court heard.

He said he had shaken his daugher and thrown her on the bed. From there, she fell to the floor, he claimed.

But the prosecutor said that Medvedevas had still failed to account for all the injuries Aukse suffered.

An examination of one of the bite marks showed it matched the defendant's teeth imprint, the court heard. 

Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC had told the court that baby Aukse was a 'helpless infant, entirely dependent upon the love and care of her parents'.

He said: 'She suffered very serious and extensive injuries - to her head and body, both externally and internally.

'The nature of these injuries tells you what the person who inflicted them intended.

'All those injuries occurred when she was in the sole care of her father.

The court had previously heard how Ms Urbikaite, an agency worker, had returned to the house she shared with Medvedevas, pictured together above, to find their daughter dead in her cot

'As he committed those acts of violence against Baby Aukse, he must have intended to kill her or to cause her really serious harm - that is murder.' 

After changing his plea during today's hearing, the judge told the jury that they had heard Medvedevas' 'clear and voluntary confession of guilt'.

He told them: 'This is a distressing case and a tragic one. You are relieved of the burden of listening to that evidence.'  

After the sentencing, Superintendent Jon Hutchinson, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: 'The appalling nature of this crime has been reflected in the sentence handed down to Medvedevas today.

'Medvedevas did not want to look after his daughter and his response was brutally violent. The baby's injuries were likened to those suffered in a car crash or as a result of being dropped from a one-storey building.

'He failed to seek assistance that could have saved her life and then refused to tell the truth on arrest and right through the legal process.

'Aukse's mother is continuing to rebuild her life and I hope the conclusion of the legal process today and the knowledge that justice has been done makes that process a little easier.'
