A couple returning from their dream holiday were forced to endure a three-hour wait for their luggage at Birmingham Airport in the early hours of the morning with their two young children.

Carl and Emma Macdonald, from Solihull, West Midlands, say their plane landed just before 1am on Monday but their suitcases did not arrive on the carousel until 4am.

In that time, they were 'stranded' with their two young children and around 100 other passengers in the baggage reclaim hall, after staff allegedly told them they could not leave and pick up their luggage the next day.

Angry Carl and Emma Macdonald endured a three-hour wait for their luggage at Birmingham Airport

Long wait:  Mr and Mrs Macdonald got to Birmingham airport just before 1am and only left at 4am

Carl, 36, and Emma, 33, had spent £3,000 on a two-week holiday in Cyprus with daughters Taloula, aged one, and Summer, nine.

They flew back with Monarch Airlines and landed in the early hours of Monday morning after a four-and-a-half-hour flight.

Mr Macdonald, who works for a glasses company, said: 'We'd originally booked with Thomson but their flight was overbooked so they put us on a Monarch plane instead.

'We got to Birmingham just before 1am, went to the baggage reclaim hall and sat and waited for our suitcases to come on the carousel. We waited and waited and eventually they came out at 4am.'

According to Mr Macdonald there were around 100 other passengers in the same position, many with young children.

Mr MacDonald asked if  his family could leave the airport and return later, but the airport staff said no

'Taloula's nappy needed changing but we didn't have any spare nappies in our bags so couldn't change her,' he said.

'We kept asking the airport staff what the delay was and all they'd tell us was that it was due to only having three baggage handlers on duty. 

'But a Thomson flight arrived from Tenerife while we were waiting and they all got their suitcases straight away.'

Mr MacDonald explained that they asked if they could go away and pick up their bags later and were told no.

'She told us we couldn't leave the airport without our suitcases so we were stranded there all night even though we only live five minutes away,' he said. 

'In that time, we didn't get offered so much as a glass of water.'

A spokeswoman for Monarch said she was unaware of any delays getting baggage at Birmingham during that time. 

'But if customers have any feedback, it's helpful they let us know through our customer services team so we can look into any issues,' she said.

The couple had booked with Thomson but their flight was full so they were put on a Monarch plane

A spokesman for Menzies Aviation, which handles Monarch's baggage, apologised to the Macdonald family. He said: 'Two inbound flights made substantially delayed arrivals at around 12.30am, alongside another which was scheduled to land at the same time.

'This created a period of heavy congestion for our baggage team at the airport, which had a knock-on effect on the handling of baggage for the Larnaca flight when it arrived at around 1.10am. 

'Further to this scheduling issue, our eight-person crew also sustained two sickness absences.'
