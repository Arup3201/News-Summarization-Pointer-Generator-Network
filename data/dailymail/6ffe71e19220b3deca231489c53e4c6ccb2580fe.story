A fire has broken out a new Â£125million entertainment venue in Glasgow.

It is thought the blaze started in the roof space of The Hydro, which is still under construction and due to open in September.

Around 40 firefighters attended the scene after the Scottish Fire & Rescue Service started receiving calls from the public around 3.20pm about thick plumes of black smoke billowing from the site.

Firefighters used two high reach platforms to spray two separate areas which were alight.

A fire service spokesman said: 
'Firefighters were met with a developing fire within the roof space of 
the building which is currently under construction and, in recognising 
the complexity of the structure in relation to where the fire was 
located, the incident commander immediately requested additional special
high reach appliances to attack the fire.'

There are no reported casualties and the fire service has yet to establish a cause for the fire.

It was recently announced that Rod Stewart will play the opening concert at the 12,000-seat venue on September 30.

Operators want it to become part of the top five busiest indoor music arenas in the world alongside the likes of London's O2.

Located next to the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) on the banks of the Clyde, The Hydro is also scheduled to host some Commonwealth Games events next year.
