A mother from Essex has been told that she is not entitled to a British passport because her father is not named on her birth certificate.

Christine North has lived in Britain since she was seven years old, and is the daughter of a British Army soldier who met her mother while stationed in Germany.

She is married to an Englishman, has done jury service twice and has voted at every election since she turned 18.

But the 32-year-old is officially not a citizen of the UK because she is unable to prove that her father was in fact British.

Denied: Christine North has been told she is not eligible for a British passport despite having an English father

Her mother Beate Toepke met her father, Mancunian soldier Alan Griffiths, at a British Army base in Dortmund, Germany.

However, because they had a turbulent relationship, Ms Toepke did not name Mr Griffiths as Christine's father on her birth certificate.

She later married another British soldier, Kevin Johnson, and moved to the UK when her daughter was seven.

Mrs North, who lives in Clacton, Essex, says she regards herself as entirely British - but when she first applied for a passport, she discovered she was not entitled to one.

Father: But Alan Griffiths, pictured, was never named on his daughter's birth certificate

'I was told I might not be a British citizen,' she said. 'I was dumbfounded. I was passed from passport information to border control and on to immigration.

'At one point they told me I might be deported. I was scared they would just take me away from my family one day.

'For some time I was claiming disability benefits due to a long-term health issue and they said I might have been ineligible and have to pay it all back.

'In the space of a few hours on the phone, my world was turned upside down.'

Mrs North later realised that the problem was that her father was not listed on her birth certificate - even though he had paid child support while she was growing up.

'He was not put on the birth certificate because of difficulties between him and my mum,' the mother of two said.

'As far as I'm concerned I'm English. I was brought up and educated that way and have lived here from a young age.'

She has met with German officials in an attempt to secure a German passport so she can travel abroad, but is adamant that the law should be changed to allow her to take British citizenship.

As it currently stands, Mrs North would have to take a test on 'life in the UK' in order to qualify for a British passport through residency and her marriage to Stephen, her husband of five years.

She added: 'It is absolutely ridiculous that I am being told that I should take a citizenship test with questions about Shakespearean plays and naming kings and queens of old.

'I am being made to pay because my biological father was not interested in hanging around. I spoke to officials at the German Embassy and they just laughed and said, "Why would you belong to us?" - and they are right because I am British.

'I just want my passport and will not stop till I get one. At the moment I am stateless. I don't have a home.'

Her local MP, Conservative backbencher Douglas Carswell, described her plight as 'bizarre', and has vowed to lobby the Government over the issue.

'Christine appears to have fallen through a ludicrous loophole in the law,' he said. 'She is as British as anyone here, a Clacton woman through and through, and the situation is bizarre.

'I have done everything I can, including writing in the strongest terms possible to the Home Secretary Theresa May.'

'If these rules don't allow for some human wiggle room then there is something profoundly wrong with the system.

'Anyone who knows the facts of this case knows how silly it is - but when you point this out to the officials they just shrug. It is quite insane.'
