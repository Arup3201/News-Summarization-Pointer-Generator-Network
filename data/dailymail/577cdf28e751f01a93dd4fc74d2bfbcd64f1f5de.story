Patients who undergo planned operations at the weekend rather than a Monday are 82 per cent more likely to die.

Shocking findings show that death rates for elective procedures increase throughout the working week.

This will add to mounting concern about NHS patients receiving poor care during ‘antisocial’ hours when consultants are off duty.

The study has led to calls for a rethink on whether elective surgery should take place at the weekend

The study suggests for the first time that some weekdays are safer than others, with Friday and the weekend being most hazardous for planned surgery.

Researchers from Imperial College London looked at four million elective operations in NHS hospitals in England between 2008 and 2011 with at least one night spent in hospital.

Elective surgery normally involves procedures such as heart bypass, hip and knee replacements, gastric operations and hysterectomies.

Altogether 27,500 patients died within 30 days of surgery, with the risk lowest for those having it on Monday and rising on each subsequent day of the week.

The extra risk on Tuesday was minimal, but went up to 15 per cent on Wednesday, 21 per cent for Thursday patients and 44 per cent on Friday (all compared with Monday).

Almost one in 20 operations was performed at a weekend, when the increased risk reached 82 per cent, said the study published online at bmj.com.

The study found that the risk from elective operations in the NHS increased throughout the week

Lead researcher Dr Paul Aylin said: ‘The
first 48 hours after an operation are often the most critical period of
care for surgery patients. A failure to rescue the patient could be due
to well-known issues relating to reduced and/or locum staffing and 
poorer availability of staff over a weekend.’

Frailer patients were at even higher risk at weekends.

Dr Aylin said: ‘Unlike previous studies, we included both deaths in hospital and deaths after discharge, so this eliminates a potential bias of counting only in-hospital deaths.

'We tried to account for the possibility that different types of patients might have operations at the end of the week, but our adjustment made little difference.

‘This leaves us with the possibility 
that the differences in mortality rates are due to poorer quality of 
care at the weekend, perhaps because of less availability of staff, 
resources and diagnostic services.’

The Imperial College London study found frailer patients were even more at risk at weekends

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week condemned the scandal of out-of-hours care

Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week condemned the scandal of out-of-hours 
care, with patients seldom able to see their own GP as opposed to locum 
doctors ‘who don’t know you from Adam’.

Canadian doctors writing a commentary on the study said there should be a rethink on whether any elective surgery should take place at the weekend.

They wrote: ‘Although emergency procedures such as the repair of ruptured aortic aneurysms cannot be controlled, the scheduling of elective procedures, such as knee replacements, is wholly within our control.

‘If weekend care proves to deliver poorer outcomes than its weekday counterpart, it might be argued that elective procedures should not be scheduled at weekends at all.’

Previous research found that hundreds of deaths could be avoided every year by putting consultants in charge of care, regardless of the day of the week.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘We know  of cases where patients get admitted  on a Friday night and, if there’s a bank  holiday, they don’t get any proper  care until Tuesday morning because of the lack of experienced staff and  diagnostic facilities.

‘Quite apart from the human cost, this costs the NHS because they may need more treatment as a result.’
