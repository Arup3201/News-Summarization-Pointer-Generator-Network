First came the 99p party dress from OMGfashion.co.uk then Bid TV tried to better it by offering the 1p party dress for fashionistas on a tight budget.

Although seemingly ridiculously cheap, both items came with a minimum delivery price of £7.95.

Now one company has gone even further in their quest to offer the best bargain by unveiling the 1 penny party shoe with free delivery.

The diamante studded black and nude stilettos are only 1 penny and have no delivery fee

UK based fashion brand Internacionale say
they are going ‘All American’ 
and are celebrating Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving synonymous 
in the U.S. with mega discounts, with a 'practically priceless party 
offer'.

For just one day only, the nude and black diamante-studded stilettos will be slashed from their original price of £24.99 to just a penny, with free UK delivery.

The company describe this as 'the best offer in the Shoeniverse' and have a limited amount of 500 shoes up for grabs (although only one pair can be purchased per customer).

The brand are likely to be hoping for the same result that online fashion retailer OMGfashion.co.uk experienced when they led the way with the 99p party dress.

It was a huge PR success with 300 dresses sold in just 15 minutes and 100,000 new visitors to the site over one weekend.

Although the company lost money on every dress sold, the amount of increased traffic to the site and subsequent sales of other items meant the style stunt was a huge commercial success too.

First came the 99p party dress (L) followed by the 1p party outfit but both had hefty delivery costs

Speaking about the cut-price offer, Georgina Whalley, Head Of Marketing at Internacionale said: 'With 50 per cent of Brits planning to cut back on spending this Christmas the ‘Party Shoe For A Penny’ offer gives our customers the chance to treat themselves, without dipping into their present budget.

'And with the shopping madness of Black Friday looming in the U.S., we thought it was the perfect time to launch such an amazing offer.'

The offer will run online only from 9am - 12 midnight on Friday 23rd November 2012.

Whatever next? The 1p wardrobe?
