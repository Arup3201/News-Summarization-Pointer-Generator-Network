A former American school teacher is being extradited to the United States to face prosecution in Illinois on sexual assault charges, the U.S. Embassy in Bosnia said Wednesday.  

American Michael R. Vucic is charged with predatory criminal sexual assault and criminal sexual assault while employed at a public school in Ingleside, Illinois.

Vucic allegedly assaulted a girl in 2012 while teaching at Gavin South Middle School in Ingleside.

At the time she was one of Vucic's students and in his class, The Chicago Tribune reported.

Vucic was an 18-year veteran of the middle school and his arrest was issued August 29, the newspaper reported.

'[T]he victim told her grandparents that Vucic had inappropriate sexual contact with her multiple times in 2012,' according to The Tribune.

The U.S. embassy says the 41-year-old teacher fled the country in August, was found hiding in Bosnia, and arrested in September.

The Foreigners Affairs Service apprehended the man outside the city of Mostar, the embassy says.

Vucic was being escorted by the U.S. Marshal Service back to the United States Wednesday, the embassy said in a statement.

The embassy said 'The United States Embassy in BiH applauds the excellent work of the Foreigners Affairs Service on finding and apprehending Vucic, and the Border Police who facilitated his departure.

'This case highlights the continued cooperation and positive relationship between the U.S. Embassy and host government law enforcement agencies in Bosnia and Herzegovina.'
