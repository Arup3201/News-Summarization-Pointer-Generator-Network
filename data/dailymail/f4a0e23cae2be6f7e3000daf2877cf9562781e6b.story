The man who allegedly beat to death the 'secret' son of Minnesota Vikings' star Adrian Peterson has a history of domestic violence, it was revealed today.

Joseph
 Robert Patterson, 27, the mother's boyfriend, was charged on Friday with aggravated assault and aggravated
 assault on an infant. 

The two-year-old boy, named locally as Ty, passed away on Friday at a South Dakota hospital after being 
admitted on Wednesday. The football star's father Nelson confirmed that 
the boy who died was his grandson.

Patterson appeared in court on Friday to be arraigned on the felony charges. Additional charges may be added now that the child has died, South Dakota State’s Attorney's office said.

The little boy was brutally beaten on Wednesday while in Patterson’s home at Platinum Valley Apartments, Sioux Falls where he had recently moved with his mother. Patterson was the sole caregiver at the time.

Initially,
 police were told that the child had choked on candy. Only later did it 
emerge that his brain injuries were the result of being violently shaken.

The arrest was made 
after police found the little boy with injuries 'consistent with 
abuse'.

Patterson is being held in Minnehaha County Jail, South Dakota on $750,000 cash bond.

He is scheduled to appear in court on October 23 but a grand jury indictment is expected before then.

South Dakota State’s Attorney Thomas Wollman filed motions on Friday ordering Patterson to serve two year-long sentences that had been suspended on prior domestic assault charges.

Patterson had pleaded guilty in 2012 to simple assault in an incident involving an ex-girlfriend and her three-year-old son.

The woman requested a protection order saying that Patterson had spanked her little boy so hard that she had to ice the welts on his buttocks, according to the Argus.

She also said that he choked and punched her, threatened her with a knife
 and held her in the bedroom against her will, according to records.

She asked for the protection orders prior to the birth of the son she has with Patterson.

As part of his prior charges, Patterson was ordered to undergo family violence training and to stay
 away from the woman until completing it.

A different woman requested a protection order against Patterson in 2004 in Jackson County.

It is believed that Patterson only recently began a relationship with the mother of the child he allegedly killed.

A candlelit vigil was held in Sertoma Park, Sioux Falls to remember the little boy on Friday.

One woman told the Argus Leader that Ty 'was a spunky boy full of life, who was ''always running, jumping and into everything... but whose big brown eyes made it hard to be mad at him'.

Another attendee, Vanja Srdic, 27, described the two-year-old as 'very happy, very strong-willed, so much potential, a go-getter little boy. His mom was his world'.

Following the news of his son's death, NFL star Peterson tweeted: 'Thank you to my family, my fans and fans of other teams for their support.

'The NFL is a fraternity of brothers and I am thankful for the tweets, phone calls and text messages from my fellow players.

Peterson added: 'God Bless everyone and thank u so much.'

Peterson has been 
pictured publicly with his son Adrian Jr, who is two, but it was another two-year-old boy who died on Friday.

The football star, who also has a ten-year-old daughter Adeja, was spotted in Sioux Falls, South Dakota on Thursday.

Other sports stars quickly offered their condolences following the child's tragic death.

Basketball
 star LeBron James tweeted: 'My deepest condolences goes out to Adrian 
Peterson and his family! Sending prayers up for you homie! Nothing I can
 say can help u through.'.

Baseball player Bryce Harper wrote: 
'Prayers go out to @AdrianPeterson and his family! What a cruel world we
 live in! Truly unbelievable! #GodBless'

A friend of the boy's mother in Sioux Falls told CityPages
 that the mother of the child had a casual relationship with the NFL 
star when she lived in Twin Cities but had since moved to South 
Dakota.

A recent paternity 
test revealed that Peterson was the little boy's father. The child has 
his mothers' last name and the father is not identified on the birth 
certificate.

Peterson knew that he was the father of the child before he was tragically killed.

In a phone interview with the Pioneer Press, Nelson Peterson said the injured boy is not Adrian Jr., but is his grandson.

'All
 I can say is, we are asking for prayers and for respect for our family 
as we deal with this tragic situation,' Nelson Peterson said.

Adrian Peterson spoke to the media on Friday afternoon and thanked everyone for their support. He told reporters he was dealing with the situation and has asked for privacy.

'I really appreciate all the support that I’ve been receiving from fans, the Vikings organization,' he said.

'This
 is a private matter and I would ask you all to please just respect my 
privacy and not ask at all about the situation at hand. Thanks.'

Patterson was charged with assault in 2012 and ordered to undergo family violence training

Asked
 about his mindset, Peterson said: 'Football is something I will always 
fall back on. It gets me through tough times. Just being around the guys
 in here, that’s what I need.'

He said that he will be playing for the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday in a home game against the Carolina Panthers. 

However a Viking source told ESPN that following his son's death that 'could change'.

Sioux Falls Police Department spokesman Sam Clemens said many people have asked about the identity of the boy's father.

'At
 this point, we're not going to confirm anything. Who the father is does
 not come into play in this investigation, so we’re not going to be 
releasing any information as far as that goes,' he said.

'We're
 not here to talk about the parents of this child,' said Lincoln County 
Attorney Thomas Wollman. 'We wouldn't talk in a normal case about who 
the parents are.'

Lincoln County State's Attorney Tom Wollman asked that people respect the family's privacy.

'The parents and extended family are suffering greatly,' he said.
