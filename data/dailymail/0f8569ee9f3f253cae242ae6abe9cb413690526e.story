Alexis Sanchez fired Arsenal to a late 1-0 victory over Southampton at the Emirates Stadium to narrow the gap on the Barclays Premier League top four to two points.

Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham rated the players' performances at the Emirates. 

Arsenal (4-2-3-1) 

Martinez - 6

Confident performance from the stand-in goalkeeper with minimal experience. Looked the part in Arsenal's goal.

Chambers - 6.5

Another assured performance from the defender against his former club, without being exceptional.

Mertesacker - 6

Dealt well with the power and presence of Pelle in the middle up front for the opponents.

Koscielny - 6

Similar to his central defensive partner handled Southampton's threat going forward.

Monreal - 6

Tried to get forward as much as possible but at times was more of a hindrance to the team in attack and broke up moves.

Flamini - 6

Quietly went about his work to hold the midfield together and firm.

Ramsey - 5.5

Really needs to get his confidence back since returning to the side. His goal-scoring seems to have left his game.

Cazorla - 6.5

Lovely ball threaded through to send Welbeck one-on-one in the first half and looked like scoring.

Oxlade-Chamberlain - 6

Forced a good low stop from Forster with an effort in the 26th minute. There were boos from home fans for the decision to take him off in the second half, due to his display.

Sanchez - 7.5

A constant thorn in Southampton's side, dribbling with the ball at pace and threading balls through and popped up with the winner late on.

Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck struggled to make an impact against Southampton

Welbeck - 5.5

Wasteful on the ball. Missed a glorious early chance when through on goal.

SUBS

Giroud - 6

Instant impact after coming on in the second half, adding the extra threat to Arsenal's attack which they were missing in his absence. Denied with a ferocious near-post strike and a looping header by Forster.

Podolski

Only had the final 10 minutes to influence the game, and failed to do that.

Southampton (4-3-3) 

Forster - 8

Superb reaction save to tip Welbeck's header over the bar just on the stroke of half-time to keep the scores level going into the break and made an even better one-handed save in the second to deny the Arsenal striker again. Also kept out Giroud twice in one the best performances of his life.

Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster was in inspired form at the Emirates

Clyne - 7

Yet another commanding, dominant performance down Southampton's right flank. Excelling, once again, since his England debut.

Alderweireld - 5

Moved into defensive midfield after Cork hobbled off with an injured ankle and picked up a yellow card for a foul on Sanchez.

Fonte - 6

Controlled Southampton's defence from the middle, yet another in a long line of decent if not outstanding performances.

Bertrand - 6

Another good game at left-back. Bertrand dealt with Arsenal's attacks down his flank well.

S Davis - 6

Great clipped pass to set Pelle free early on but the striker fired over.

Wanyama - 6.5

Strong and solid in the centre of the south coast club side's midfield. Doing what he does best – frustrating and hassling the opposition.

Cork - 5

Unfortunate to injury his ankle early in the first half after returning to the side.

Long - 6

Worked tirelessly up and down the right and left flanks, switching sides with Tadic at times to confound Arsenal.

Pelle - 6

Should've done better with an early chance but fired over. Cut a frustrated figure, but still looked a dangerous outlet up front.

Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand put in another solid performance

Tadic - 6

Substituted just after the hour mark, having not been as effective as he usually is for the side. Still a solid performance.

SUBS

Yoshida - 5.5

Did well after coming into the centre of defence midway through the first half. So often a weak link in Southampton's defence but stood up to the test.

Mane - 6

Added pace to Southampton's play when he came on in the second half.

Mayuka

Came on for the final 10 minutes and did little
