Music fans who go to concerts only to spend half their time filming on their mobile phones are 'weird' Roger Daltrey has said, as he and The Who guitarist Pete Townshend were launching the band's 50th anniversary tour

The Who frontman, 70, admitted he struggled to understand why modern gig-goers spent so little time watching the show

'Looking at 
life through a screen and not being in the moment totally - if you’re 
doing that, you’re 50 per cent there right?

'It’s weird. I find it 
weird.'

Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend were launching the band’s 50th anniversary tour.

Townshend added: ‘If you’ve been to Glastonbury this weekend I hope you enjoyed the music rather than feeling you have to build a Facebook story about it.’

Townshend said he always embraced new technological developments but found it difficult to come to terms with the mobile phone viewers

The performance artist Marin Abramovic recently barred visitors to her current exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London from bringing in their devices in order for them to focus on the art she was creating.

Many bands find themselves facing an array of cameraphones rather than meeting the eyes of the crowd, while members of the audience further back find themselves staring at the illuminated screens which are held aloft in front of them.

Townshend said he always embraced new technological developments but found it difficult to come to terms with the mobile phone viewers.
