A real-life mermaid dances in tandem with a giant manta ray off the coast of Isla Mujeres, Mexico.

These breathtaking shots were taken by 42-year-old Emmy Award-winning cinematographer and photographer Shawn Heinrichs, from Boulder, Colorado.

The underwater images feature Australian-born 'professional mermaid', model and ocean environmentalist Hannah Fraser, who works under the name Hannah Mermaid.

'One of the first animal encounters I ever had underwater was with a manta ray. I was swimming upside down underneath its huge wingspan, blowing bubbles up onto its belly, which it seemed to love,' Hannah said

'I aspire to be as graceful and beautiful these gentle, intelligent animals who are harmless and social. They are the ballerinas of the ocean.'

Shawn and Hannah spent over 30 hours in the open ocean, treading water for up to six hours at a time.

'Capturing this intimate ballet with Hannah and these graceful giants was a sight to behold,' Shawn said.

Species: The larger species of manta ray, Manta birostris, can grow to a width of more than 20 feet and can weigh more than a tonne

'To capture these unique images, we had to approach the mantas on their terms,' said the photographer

Style: While the images may look too good to be true, they are in fact 100% authentic, with only basic adjustments made in post-production

'Often the mantas would twirl and loop below, up and over Hannah's head, their wingtips gently brushing within inches of her face.

'And then for a moment their eyes would lock, reassuring each other of their mutual acceptance.'

'To capture these unique images, we had to approach the mantas on their terms,' Shawn said.

'That meant slow, patient and non-threatening interactions, allowing the mantas to approach us and hopefully begin their dance.

'For every dozen attempts, perhaps one would result in a possible image.'

Global manta populations have been ravaged over recent years due, in part, to demand from the Chinese medicine market.

In March 2013 they were listed for international protection by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Appendix 2.

'The goal of this project was to highlight the beauty and grace of manta rays, using art and dance to feature their charismatic and gentle nature in a way the world can relate with,' Shawn added.

'Manta rays are under severe threat because of unsustainable fisheries for their gills, meat and skin. The future of manta rays rests in our hands.'
