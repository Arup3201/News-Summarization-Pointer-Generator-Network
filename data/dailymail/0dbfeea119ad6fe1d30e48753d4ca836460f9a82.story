Honduras lost their third match of the World Cup and then their coach on Wednesday as Luis Fernando Suarez stepped down after losing 3-0 to Switzerland.

Suarez, a Colombian who led Ecuador to the second round of the 2006 World Cup, quit following a third straight defeat in Brazil after losses to France and Ecuador in their opening two games.

It was clear Suarez blamed himself, as he said: 'I'm sorry I didn't manage more. I'm sad because I had a dream about this World Cup.'

The star of the show was Xherdan Shaqiri who bagged a hat-trick against the struggling side.

Honduras, though, played better as the match wore on but couldn't get the goal needed to change the momentum.

'We had more control of the ball than they did,' Suarez said. 'But that didn't lead to a result.

'I'm leaving with a good conscience. I don't think this is a defeat.

'I leave with a clean soul and conscience thinking I gave my best.'

In earlier matches at the World Cup, the Hondurans lost to France 3-0 and then fell to Ecuador 2-1, finally getting their first goal at a World Cup since 1982.

'This team is good for Honduras, but then another person can take this position and do better things,' Suarez said. 'A new coach will definitely realise that they have a very good material.'

Suarez said his contract with the football federation would expire when the team were eliminated from the World Cup, but decided to step aside regardless.

'It's not a resignation. It's not an issue with the contract,' Suarez said. 'I unilaterally take the decision of not continuing.'
