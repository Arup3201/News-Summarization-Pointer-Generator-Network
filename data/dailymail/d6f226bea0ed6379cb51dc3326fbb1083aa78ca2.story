Pippa Middleton is set to be questioned by Paris police after the driver of a car in which she was travelling waved a pistol at a photographer.

Disturbing images of the incident were captured on Saturday as Prince William’s 27-year-old sister-in-law travelled in an Audi convertible in the centre of the French capital.

The driver of the car, who has not yet been identified, can clearly be seen pointing what looks like a semi-automatic pistol at a photographer on a moped.

It came just hours after Miss Middleton attended a 
lavish fancy dress party to celebrate the 29th birthday of Paris fashion entrepreneur Arthur de 
Soultrait. She left the bash at 6am.

In the top picture, Mr Soultrait can be seen sitting in the back of the Audi wearing a blue baseball cap. The other backseat passenger has yet to be identified.

Both Arthur and his brother Marcy, who was seen with Miss Middleton afterwards, were today said to be 
‘mortified’ by what had happened, and were preparing to ‘explain 
themselves’ to the authorities, said a close friend.

The man who actually waved the gun, 
meanwhile, was said to be ‘keeping a low profile’ and hoping that 
‘everything will calm down’.

If the gun turns out to be real, all those involved in the incident face up to seven years in prison, while even if it is a fake they could be sentenced to two years.

France is currently on heightened 
security alert after Islamic terrorist Mohammed Merah used a handgun to 
murder seven people in the south west of the country last month.

Two men were also arrested in the 
Paris area at the weekend in connection with four murders carried out 
with a pistol in the nearby Essonne department over the past five 
months.

Pippa, whose 30-year-old sister is 
Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was being driven to the Gare du Nord 
station to board a Eurostar high speed train to London.

At least one witness has made a formal complaint to Paris police, providing pictures of what happened.

These have been handed over to judicial police who will have to decide whether to alert an examining magistrate.

If they consider that there is enough 
evidence for a prosecution, then Pippa and the three men will be among 
those summoned to give evidence.

A judicial source said: ‘If the 
evidence points to (Pippa Middleton’s) involvement, she will be 
prosecuted.

'Anybody involved in the illegal use of a handgun in public 
is liable to arrest and interrogation.'

A police source said that it was ‘absolutely forbidden’ for anyone to use a gun to ‘warn people off’ in France.

He added: ‘If someone has a licence 
then for a weapon then it must be kept covered at all times, and away 
from members of the public.’

Many of the illegal guns in France are
bought on the black market from Eastern European criminals who drive to
France from countries like Russia.

‘People have been able to pick up 
pistols for as little as 200 euros,’ said the source. ‘Everything is now
being done to control this trade.’

Security was stepped up in Paris at the weekend because of the French presidential elections.

Nicolas Sarkozy was speaking at an 
open air rally in the centre of the city on Sunday, while his Socialist 
rival Francois Hollande was at another open-air meeting just two miles 
away.

Fame: There has been a huge interest in Miss Middleton following her appearance at the Royal Wedding last year

Pippa arrived in Paris on Friday to 
attend Arthur de Soultrait’s party at a theatre in the St 
Germain-des-Pres district of Paris, which had been turned into a 
nightclub.

Some 300 guests took part in a Louis 
XIV and Marie Antoinette themed evening, which included three dwarves 
serving champagne and canapes.

A man dressed as a Cardinal was also present, but he carried a copy of the Kama Sutra sex guide, rather than a Bible.

During the evening, Pippa told a 
journalist ‘I’m here to enjoy myself,’ while Arthur said: ‘I love 
decadence. Nowadays you have to make people dream.

Towards the end of the evening, a 
fire-eating brunette jumped out of a cake and performed a striptease to a
‘remix’ of God Save the Queen.

Guests at Friday's party wore fancy dress in  keeping with the theme of the do, which appeared to be based on fashions from centuries ago.

Though her outfit wasn't quite as overt as some of the other guests at 
the party, Miss Middleton still appeared to have made an effort with her bright 
pink costume.

After the bash, she continued celebrating at the exclusive Chez Raspoutine club in the centre of Paris.

For her late-night 
outfit Miss Middleton threw on a leather jacket over her period costume,
with a pair of leggings and gold flats.

Viscount Arthur de Soultrait is an old friend of Miss Middleton's - she stayed 
with him at his Paris apartment last May after attending the French 
Open.

The French aristocrat is the man behind Vicomte A, a label that sells 
brightly coloured preppy clothing and sportswear all around the world.

He is designing the ties for the French Olympic team in 2012, the slogan of his label is 'L'Instinct Chic'.

The firm was started when de Soultrait was left high and dry after a 
company he'd began working as an intern for in the U.S. went bankrupt 
after just a week of him being there.

He sold a selection of ties he'd brought with him to the States and 
managed to raise enough funds to return home, and create his own line of
100% silk ties.

A selection of brightly colored polo shirts followed, attracting the business of affluent young businessmen.

Following her appearance at the Royal Wedding last year, there has been huge interest in Miss Middleton.

As a result she is often followed by photographers and is  known to guard her privacy when in the UK
