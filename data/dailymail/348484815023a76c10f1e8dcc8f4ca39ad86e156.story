This mother of five has never been in labour for more than two hours - and she remarkably manages to beat her delivery record every time she gives birth.

Mary Gorgens, who has never been given much warning before she goes into labour, has continued her stretch of speedy deliveries giving birth to her latest child in just two minutes. 

Even though the 35-year-old from Sydney has earned herself a reputation of rapid-fire births, nothing could have prepared her for the latest delivery on January 30. 

Mary Gorgens, 35, was given just two minutes warning before she gave birth to her son Brody  on the floor of her Sydney bedroom on January 30

Rapid fire births: Mary and Simon Gorgens have had five children (Ava, Mila, Brody, Max and Sienna) and all births have been quicker than the last

Ms Gorgens went to the toilet in the early hours of the morning after feeling a slight twinge but had to quickly 'waddle' back to the bedroom when she felt her son's head starting to come out. 

She woke her husband Simon who stumbled to the bathroom thinking he had some time.

When he came back, the 40-year-old found his wife on all fours and two minutes later he was holding his son Brody in his arms.

'I had no inkling, no feeling, no pain. He was two days early, I really wasn't expecting it that day,' Ms Gorgens told Daily Mail Australia. 

Luckily, the Gorgen family are used to these rapid-fire births.

When she gave birth to their first child Max in December 2008, Ms Gorgens made it to the hospital with just 12 minutes to spare. 

The couple's eldest son Max was born in December 2008. It took just two hours from the time Mary felt the first twinge and they made it to the hospital with just 12 minutes to spare

It took 90 minutes for baby Ava to arrive in August 2010 when she was born on the way to the hospital. She was still in her amniotic sack and the midwife found her inside her mother's pants 

'I wasn't even sure I was in labour. I called my husband and then the pain came really quickly. By the time he got home I was ready to push and I could feel the head,' she said.

'We waddled up to maternity and they ran out – I was screaming at that point. They rushed me into delivery and threw me up on to the bed. 

'One push and the head was out and one more and then his body came out. We got to the hospital at 10.22am and Max was born at 10.34am.'

It took two hours for Max to be born from the time Ms Gorgens felt the first twinge.

'The next two were born in the car and the other two at home,' she said. 'I haven't had any pain relief in any birth because there hasn't been enough time.'

The couple's second child Ava was born in 90 minutes in August 2010. 

Sienna was born in December 2011 when her dad pulled onto a median strip en route to the hospital. Mary was 50 minutes into labour when Ava arrived

Mary and Simon didn't even make it to the car when Mila was born in March 2013. The couple were given 10 minutes warning before the baby popped out on the bedroom floor

Mary went to the toilet  after feeling a slight twinge but had to quickly 'waddle' back to the bedroom when she felt her son's head starting to come out. Her son Brody was born just two minutes later in her bedroom

'My hubby got home again and I already felt like I needed to push. We got in the car but I told him I didn't think we would make it,' she said. 

'She was born at some point along the way, but she was still in her amniotic sack.

'I was fully clothed and she slipped past everything I was wearing... even my underwear. It was very bizzare.'

The midwife who met them at the hospital pulled Ms Gorgens' pants down in the car and she found baby Ava.

'We couldn't hear her because she was still in her sack. I was a little scared to look because we couldn't hear crying,' she said.

'She was perfectly okay - Simon cut the cord when we were still in the car.'

When it came to Sienna's birth in December 2011, the couple attempted the hospital dash again.

'Simon managed to stop on the median strip, he ran to my side and her head was already coming out,' Ms Gorgens said.

'He grabbed her and delivered her... then we rushed to the hospital again. Sienna only took 50 minutes.' 

Mary hasn't had pain relief in any of her five births because there hasn't been enough time

Simon has delivered the three youngest children because they couldn't make it to the hospital in time

Mila, Ava, Brody, Max and Sienna (L-R) were all born healthy despite only the eldest being born in the hospital

But the couple's fourth child was considerably quicker and they didn't even made it to the car.

'Mila was born on our bedroom floor in 10 minutes,' Ms Gorgens said.

'It was at night in March 2013 and I had just finished cooking - everything was fine. I had seen the midwife that day and she said any time now.

'I put the two girls to bed and Max was still getting ready. I started pacing in our bedroom and all of a sudden it just ramped up.' 

She screamed out for her husband to grab some towels and the couple had to lock themselves in their bedroom so their four-year-old son wouldn't see.

'I got on all fours and pushed. Sienna was still in her sack as well and Simon had to break it with his fingers as he guided her out. He wasn't even sure what he was supposed to do.'

Mary has never been given much warning when she goes into labour but even she couldn't be prepared for Brody's rapid-fire birth in January

 The couple aren't looking to have more children right now and they don't think they could beat the record

Ms Gorgens hasn't had pain relief in any of her five births because there hasn't been enough time.

'I don't have pains for hours on end beforehand. It's intense for a short amount of time. It's pretty crazy. I've had five go that way and they have all been quicker than the last.

'My friends joke that I could sneeze and a baby would pop out.'

The mother of five considers herself extremely lucky with some of her friends going through 40 hours labours. 

'I'm lucky because even though we weren't in hospital, at the end of the day they went smoothly and they were all healthy. 

'It's amazing what your body can do.' 

The couple aren't looking to have more children right now, but aren't prepared to close the door just yet. 

'I definitely don't think I could (deliver) any faster though,' Ms Gorgens said.
