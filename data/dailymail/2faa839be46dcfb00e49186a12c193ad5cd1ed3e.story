Upset: Anthea Turner is said to be considering divorce proceedings against 50-year-old Grant Bovey after claims he cheated on her with heiress Zoe de Mallet Morgan, pictured

He has broken Anthea Turner’s heart with a woman young enough to be his daughter.

And yesterday it emerged that Grant Bovey is linked to his alleged 24-year-old lover through his own children.

Miss Turner is said to be considering divorce proceedings against 50-year-old Bovey after claims he cheated on her with heiress Zoe de Mallet Morgan.

But as the former GMTV presenter told how she was ‘devastated’ by her husband’s apparent infidelity, it emerged that his daughter Amelia shares friends on Facebook with his new flame.

A girl called Natalia Shand is friends with both Amelia, 19, and Miss de Mallet Morgan on social networking sites.

According to her Facebook page, Miss Shand was a pupil at the private Hurtwood House school near Dorking in Surrey, which Bovey’s eldest daughter, Lily, 20, also attended.

And Miss Shand is not the only link. Another of Miss de Mallet Morgan’s friends on social networking sites, Olivia Stovold, is also friends with Miss Turner.

Miss Turner is very selective about whom she allows as friends on Facebook, requesting that those who are ‘not a family member or a close friend’ do not contact her.

It is not known where Miss de Mallet Morgan went to school and she has now removed her Facebook profile from the site.

The revelations come as friends of Miss Turner say she has been desperately trying to work out how her husband could have met Miss de Mallet Morgan, her initial suspicion being that they met at a race meeting in Ascot last year.

The romance is believed to have started while Miss Turner was working on a TV programme in Canada.

Rumours of Bovey’s extra-marital relationship with Miss de Mallet Morgan first surfaced as early as two years ago.

At the time Bovey publicly boasted about being home alone while his wife worked abroad trying to keep the family afloat after he was made bankrupt.

‘In Guildford having lunch with my children Anthea in Canada!!’ he wrote in the first message at the end of  May 2010.

Then, on June 7, he wrote  ‘AT [Anthea Turner] in Canada’, before adding a minute later: ‘Anthea in Canada On my own for a few weeks!!!!’.

After no further tweets for a week, he then posted: ‘AT in Canada at home tonight with some mates watching footie!!’

In September Bovey sent another message remarking on his wife’s absence, but this time before she had even gone. ‘Anthea back to Canada in two weeks!!’ he wrote.

Miss de Mallet Morgan is thought to be out of the country. Yesterday a friend said: ‘We have no comment.’

Miss Turner, whose career includes stints on Blue Peter and GMTV, married property developer Bovey 12 years ago after he left his wife Della for her.

He is no longer at the couple’s £5million mansion in Esher, Surrey.

A friend of Miss Turner’s said: ‘Anthea is getting into the angry phase now. She’s going away for a few days to celebrate her step-daughter’s birthday and she will decide what to do then.

'She was devoted to Grant and only went away to earn money because he lost all of their money.’

Another source said Bovey’s alleged affair may have gone on for longer than originally thought, saying: ‘A couple of years ago there was a rumour going around Surrey that they were seeing each other.’

Interior designer Miss de Mallet Morgan comes from wealthy country stock. Her parents Tommy and Louise are millionaires.

Miss Turner, who has also had stints on reality shows including Celebrity Big Brother and Hell’s Kitchen, talked several years ago about the financial pressures she and Bovey had faced.

The one-time TV golden girl had to sell her £10million estate in 2009 and a year later Bovey was declared bankrupt after the collapse of his property company.

Last night, Bovey declined to say whether he has been seeing Miss de Mallet Morgan for two years, telling the Daily Mail: ‘I don’t want to add any fuel to the fire.’
