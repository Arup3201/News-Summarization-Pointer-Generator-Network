As you sit down in front of your hi-tech television, you may think you are the only one watching.

But as you catch up on your favourite shows, your internet-enabled 'smart TV' could be harvesting your personal data or even filming you through a camera, the Ofcom chairman warned yesterday.

Dame Colette Bowe, who is stepping down from her post at the media regulator later this month, warned of the risks posed by new televisions that contain cameras and microphones, suggesting companies could use them to spy on customers.

She told the Lords' Communications Committee she was concerned about the 'relatively unknown risks and dangers that consumers face'.

She continued: 'If you have a smartphone you are carrying a computer around in  your pocket. A smart TV may well have a camera and a microphone in it. It is there in your living room. What is that smart TV doing? Do people realise that?'

As head of Ofcom, Dr Bowe is in charge of overseeing the regulation of most of the UK's television industry, as well as its mobile telephone networks and internet providers.

She warned the problem of protecting consumers' data was the biggest challenge the sector currently faces, but stopped short of calling for new laws to protect privacy.

She said: 'In terms of big challenges coming towards us it is in the area of data, privacy and people's willingness to yield up information about themselves and place themselves in positions of some risk, because of poorly understood uses of this technology. It is a major challenge, though whether it is a legislative challenge I'm not sure.'

In November, smart TV manufacturer LG was accused of collecting data about its customers' viewing habits, even after they enabled privacy settings on their sets.

An IT consultant claimed his set was monitoring the channels he was watching and had uploaded information about the contents of devices he connected to it.

The South Korean manufacturer announced an investigation into what it called a 'possible data breach', but insisted: 'Customer privacy is a top priority'.

The Information Commissioner's Office also launched an investigation into the  firm for a possible breach of the Data Protection Act.

Many new TVs include built-in cameras to allow people to make video calls from their living rooms.

But experts have warned it is possible for voyeuristic hackers to access cameras installed in some TV sets remotely, and spy on users in their own homes.

On March 31, Dr Bowe will step down from her post after five years to be replaced by former BBC policy director Patricia Hodgson. She used one of her last public appearances to call for changes in the way the BBC is run.

Recommending that the corporation appoints a board of non-executive directors, she said its current management structure is a 'mistake' and 'highly regrettable'.

And she suggested rival broadcasters such as Channel 4 ought to be allowed to use BBC technology such as iPlayer to distribute  their programmes.
