Claims: Ariel Castro, a 52-year-old former school bus driver suspected of keeping three women captive inside his decrepit house for a decade

Ariel Castro left a special needs student on his own on the school bus he ordering the teen to 'lie down bitch.'

The details emerged as the 52-year-old prepares to appear in court today on kidnapping and rape charges.

Castro worked as a Cleveland school bus driver for over 20 years until last fall when he was fired from his job.

'I enjoy working with children,' the accused Cleveland predator wrote on a job application before he was hired in February 1991.

'I plan to drive a bus, and working (sic) with young people.'

The trouble began in Castro's job a year after he allegedly abducted his first victim Michelle Knight, 32, who was 20 years old when she vanished in 2002.

In 2004 Castro abandoned a special-needs student on his bus so he could get fast food.

He told the teen 'Lay down bitch' before going into Wendy's - Castro was suspended for 60 days as a result.

He kept his head down for five years, until 2009 when he was suspended for another 60 days after making an illegal U-turn with a busload of kids on a busy Cleveland street.

On February 14 last year when used the school bus to do some grocery shopping and caught carrying three full bags of food.

A written summary of the incident showed Castro freely acknowledging that he used the official vehicle for personal business.

'When asked, in front of six union officials, if he makes a habit of stopping at (the store) on his bus, his answer was yes,' the summary recounted.

'At one point, one of the union representatives told him to stop talking.'

In September he parked his bus with the door unlocked and ajar outside a school and left it unattended for four hours.

When he was questioned about the incident he told his supervisors: 'I went home to rest. ... I felt tired that day.'

There
was only one other incident highlighted in his personal file - on March
16, 1998 a fight between students on his bus, but passengers told 
Castro was listening to music on a pair of headphones, ignoring the 
incident.

Castro led a double life through the past decade.

Born in Puerto Rico, Ariel Castro played bass in Latin music bands in the area.

Neighbors and those who know Ariel Castro said he joined in the search for Gina DeJesus nearly a decade ago and comforted her mother just a year ago at a vigil.

'When we went out to look for Gina, he helped pass out fliers,' said Khalid Samad, a community activist who said Castro was friends with DeJesus' father.

As recently as 2005, Castro was accused of repeated acts of violence against his children's mother.

A domestic-violence court filing at the time accused Castro of twice breaking the nose of his children's mother, knocking out a tooth, dislocating each shoulder and threatening to kill her and her daughters three or four times in a year.

Neighbors say Castro played bass guitar in salsa and merengue bands and gave neighborhood children rides on his motorcycle.

Juan
Perez, who lives two doors down from the house, said Castro was always 
happy and respectful. 'He gained trust with the kids and with the 
parents. You can only do that if you're nice,' Perez said.

Another neighbor, Francisco Cruz, said he was with Castro the day investigators dug up a yard looking for the girls.

Castro told Cruz, 'They're not going to find anyone there,' Cruz recalled.

His two brothers, initially arrested 
as suspects in the case, were not charged, and police said investigators
had determined they had no knowledge of the abductions or captivity of 
the women.

The three victims, abducted 
separately from the surrounding neighborhood and completely cut off from
the outside world during their captivity, were found alive together 
when neighbors were alerted by cries for help from one of the women, 
Amanda Berry.

She told police that her escape two 
days ago was her first chance to break free in the 10 years that she was
imprisoned in the house, during which time she conceived and gave birth
to a daughter, now 6, authorities said.

The little girl was rescued along 
with Berry, 27, who was a day shy of her 17th birthday when she 
disappeared in 2003, and the two other women - Gina DeJesus, 23, who 
went missing at age 14 in 2004, and Michelle Knight, 32, who was 20 
years old when she vanished in 2002.

Chilling new details of their 
captivity emerged as two of the women were treated to jubilant 
celebrations with relatives - Berry and her daughter arriving at her 
sister's house and DeJesus at her mother's home in separate homecomings 
captured on national television.

Knight remained in a Cleveland hospital, where she was listed in good condition.
