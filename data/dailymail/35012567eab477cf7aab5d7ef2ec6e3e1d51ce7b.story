Republican Todd Akin paid for his 'legitimate rape' remarks, losing last night to Democratic Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill.

Though McCaskill was considered the most vulnerable incumbent, Akin severely damaged his candidacy in August when he said women's bodies have ways of avoiding pregnancy in 'legitimate rape.'

He deeply hurt his campaign after saying on a St Louis television show this fall: 'If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.'

Akin took only 39 percent of the vote, with 55 percent going to Macaskill, and 6 percent going to a third party candidate.

In his concession speech, Akin compared himself to people who have 
suffered from cancer, saying people like him 'suffer of cancer, loss of a
job, house, loved ones and they press on.'

He continued: 'They're the backbone of 
America. When called, they'll risk their lives for their country or 
their community, but they don't think of themselves as particularly 
special. They don't look to government for special deals, but they do 
think that the government should respect our hard-earned tax dollars 
that it collects. In short, they love God, they love their families and 
they love our country.'

Akin added, 'You know, we believe that life, liberty and the pursuit 
of happiness come from almighty God, not an almighty government ... and 
we believe that the Constitution is not a list of suggestions.'

Meanwhile, Indiana's 
Republican senate hopeful Richard Mourdock lost to Democrat Joe 
Donnelly, following his ill-received comments that pregnancy from rape 
is 'something God intended.'

In Indiana, Democratic Rep. Joe Donnelly triumphed over tea party-backed state Treasurer Richard Mourdock, whose own clumsy comment about rape and abortion in the closing days of the race damaged his chances of securing the much-coveted seat.

With 61 percent of the vote, Donnelly was ahead by about 3,000 votes.

Democratic candidates grabbed the lead in two Republican-held Senate seats in Massachusetts and Indiana on Tuesday, complicating the GOP's drive to seize control of the Senate.

Independent Angus King won the GOP Senate seat in Maine to add a dose of uncertainty to the fierce fight for the majority.

Democrat Elizabeth Warren held the edge in Massachusetts over Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who stunned the political world in January 2010 when he won Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's seat. With 29 percent of the vote, Warren held a 52-47 percent edge.

Republicans set their sights on three Democratic-held seats - Nebraska, North Dakota and Virginia. GOP candidates in those states grabbed the early lead.

Beat: Chris Murphy, right, beat Republican opponent Linda McMahon, left, for the Connecticut Senate seat that was held by Joe Lieberman, an independent who's retiring

King prevailed over Republican Charlie
Summers and Democrat Cynthia Dill in the race to replace Republican 
Sen. Olympia Snowe, who blamed partisan gridlock in Washington for
her unexpected decision to retire after 18 years in the Senate. The 
Associated Press called the race based on interviews with voters as they
left polling stations.

In Ohio,
Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown survived an onslaught of outside 
spending, some $30 million, to defeat state treasurer Josh Mandel. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey survived a late scare from businessman Tom Smith, who invested more than $17 million of his money.

Democratic Rep. Chris Murphy won the Connecticut Senate seat held by Sen. Joe Lieberman, the independent who was the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee in 2000.

Murphy's win marked the second 
straight defeat for former wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who spent 
$50 million of her own wealth in a failed effort against Sen. Richard 
Blumenthal in 2010 and more than $42 million this election cycle.

Texas sent tea party-backed Ted Cruz to the Senate as the Republican won the seat held by retiring GOP Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.

In Florida,
Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson triumphed in his bid for a third term, 
holding off a challenge from Republican Rep. Connie Mack. Republican 
groups had spent heavily against Nelson early in the race, but the 
moderate Democrat was a prolific fundraiser with wide appeal among 
Democrats and some Republicans in the Panhandle.

Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders won a second term in Vermont. Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse in Rhode Island, Ben Cardin in Maryland and Tom Carper in Delaware were all re-elected.

Cruising to another term were Democratic Sens. Debbie Stabenow in Michigan, Kirsten Gillibrand in New York, Bob Menendez in New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar in Minnesota.

In West Virginia,
Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin won a full term even though his state went 
heavily for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.

for Sen. John Barrasso, and Republican Roger Wicker captured another 
term in Mississippi.

Win: Angus King, an independent, has won the Senate race in Maine

Former Gov. Angus King has won the Senate race in Maine, running as an independent.

King will take over the seat held by retiring Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe.

Another independent, Vermont's Sen. Bernie Sanders, also has been re-elected.

Four Democrats senators have also won re-election: Bill Nelson in Florida, Sheldon Whitehouse in Rhode Island, Ben Cardin in Maryland and Tom Carper in Delaware. Republican Sen. Bob Corker was re-elected in Tennessee.

King hasn't said which party he will caucus with, but Republican groups have spent millions of dollars opposing his candidacy.

King has resolutely refused to say 
which party he'd side with if elected, and the outcome of the 
presidential election and the final Senate lineup could influence his 
decision. Members of both parties have indicated that they expect King -
former governor and one-time Democrat who supports President Barack 
Obama - to align with Democrats.

One factor could be the million-plus 
dollars that Republican-leaning groups such as the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce and Karl Rove's organization spent on ads criticizing King.

Democrats currently hold a 53-47 edge
in the Senate, including the two independents who caucus with them. 
Republicans need a net of four seats to grab the majority, three if 
Republican Mitt Romney wins the presidency.

The caustic campaign for control of 
the Senate in a divided Congress was marked by endless negative ads and 
more than $1 billion in spending by outside groups on races from 
Virginia to Montana, Florida to New Mexico.

The outcome in Ohio and Virginia was 
closely linked to the presidential race. Republicans and Democrats in 
Massachusetts, North Dakota and Montana hoped that energetic campaigns 
and personality would lead to ticket-splitting by voters.

Republicans were on the defensive in Indiana, where tea party-backed state treasurer Richard Mourdock was locked in a close race with Democratic Rep. Joe Donnelly.

With 50 percent of the vote, Donnelly
held a narrow lead, 48 percent to 46 percent. Libertarian Andrew 
Horning, a potential factor in the final results, grabbed the remainder.

Mourdock had been considered the 
favorite after knocking out six-term Sen. Richard Lugar in the GOP 
primary in May. But he damaged his chances when he said in a debate that
pregnancy resulting from rape is ‘something God intended.’

Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who 
stunned Democrats in January 2010 by capturing Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's 
Massachusetts seat, was the underdog against Democrat Elizabeth Warren 
in one of the nation's costliest races. The two candidates agreed to no 
outside money by super PACs and other independent groups then together 
spent $68 million on their campaign.

The arithmetic was daunting for 
Democrats at the start of the election cycle - they had to defend 23 
seats to the GOP's 10. Further complicating the calculation were 
Democratic retirements in Virginia, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Hawaii, 
Nebraska and New Mexico as well as the retirement of Lieberman.

Republicans had to deal with retirements in Arizona, Texas and Maine.

Republican hopes of reclaiming the 
Senate suffered a major blow when the GOP candidate in Missouri made 
awkward remarks about rape and abortion.

Democrats and Republicans in a dozen 
states faced an onslaught of outside money that financed endless 
negative commercials and ugly mailings that left voters exasperated.

The
record independent spending - $50 million in Virginia and $40 million 
in Wisconsin in addition to $33 million in Ohio - reflected the 
high-stakes fight for the Senate.
