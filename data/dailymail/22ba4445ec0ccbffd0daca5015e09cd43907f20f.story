Dangerous cure: Herbal pills are a common treatment for menopausal symptoms

Health watchdogs have warned of the potential danger of a herbal remedy used to  treat menopausal symptoms – after one woman became so ill that she needed a liver transplant.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is concerned about products containing black cohosh, a native American plant.

It is understood the woman, who has not been named, developed liver failure after starting to use it.

It has not been confirmed how much she consumed before becoming ill.

Black cohosh is the second most popular herbal ingredient in the UK and is used to treat symptoms of the menopause such as hot flushes, night sweats, poor sleep, mood changes and irritability.

It is also often recommended as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy – and is available in capsules in most high street chemists, health food shops and supermarkets.

Richard Woodfield, the MHRA’s head of herbal policy, said: ‘It is important people with a history of liver problems do not use black cohosh herbal products.’

The latest case reported to the 
regulator is suspected to be directly linked to the woman using a 
product containing the herbal remedy and an investigation is ongoing.

The
 MHRA said it had received a total of 53 reports of adverse reactions 
suspected to be associated with the use of black cohosh products – the 
majority involving liver problems.

Black
 cohosh is registered as a herbal medicine with the MHRA under its 
Traditional Herbal Registration scheme, which was introduced last year 
to impose more stringent controls. But in some cases, the MHRA has found
 it being sold as a food supplement at more than 50 times the 
recommended dose.
