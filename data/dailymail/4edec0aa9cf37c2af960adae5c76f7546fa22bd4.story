Wildlife workers in a remote Devonshire beauty spot were horrified to discover an injured white goose had been shot with a crossbow bolt.

The animal, which was found at the Sheepstor Dam in the Burrator Reservoir on Dartmoor, is not native to the area and is thought to have been dumped there.

Warden Kit Hancock and RSPCA officer Simon Kite took a boat to the water to recover the distressed goose, which had been shot all the way through its body.

Despicable: An injured goose is seen to by vets after an unknown person shoots them with a crossbow bolt

Mr Hancock said: '[The goose] was still swimming. We managed to net it after about ten minutes and get it aboard. it didn't put up much of a fight as by then it was so worn out. Its partner was naturally not very happy and after the injured goose was taken away by the RSPCA it kept honking, calling for its mate, for about three hours afterwards. I've been doing this job for five years and thankfully incidents like this are very rare occurrences.'

Neil Reeves, countryside manager for Dartmoor, said: 'It is disgraceful behaviour to do something like this to a wild animal. I just don't understand why anyone would want to. Perhaps they wanted it for their dinner but to carry around and use a crossbow in this manner is deplorable.'

The goose was taken by Mr Kite to Drakes Vets in the nearby village of Yelverton.

Vet Ulrika Hoffman-Johnson who treated the animal said: 'The arrow went through its body just behind the legs and the tip came out the other side, just missing its ribcage and the vital organs. We gave it an X-ray, antibiotics and painkillers and stitched it up.'

The goose was returned to the RSPCA where it is now recovering at the West Hatch Wildlife Sanctuary in Taunton, Somerset.

Diana Roberts, a spokesperson for the RSPCA, said that it would rest there until fully recovered and is expected to be returned to Burrator Reservoir and its mate sometime in the next week. She said: 'We would like to know if anyone in the area saw someone carrying a crossbow at the time. Some nasty person has gone out of their way to shoot a defenceless animal.

She has appealed to anyone with any information to please contact the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018.

The police have also been notified, and they are anxious for information. Contact Sgt Dave Anning at Tavistock Police Station by calling 101. Crime reference 184 02/05/13.
