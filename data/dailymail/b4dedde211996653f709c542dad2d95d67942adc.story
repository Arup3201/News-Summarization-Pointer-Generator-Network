City streets left abandoned, desolate Ferris wheels turning with no-one on board and traffic lights aimlessly switching from red to green without a single car in sight to see them change.

These are just some of the haunting images from a short video by French filmmakers showing what post-apocalyptic Paris could look like.

Called Hypocentre, the four-and-a-half 
minute film shows the usually bustling areas around the Eiffel Tower, 
Champs Elysees and the streets of Montaparnasse empty and devoid of 
people and cars.

French producers Menilmonde filmed timelapse videos around the city, including near the Eiffel Tower, pictured, before using photo-editing tools to remove the people and cars. The video was designed to highlight what the city would look like if life ended

To create the video, the two filmmakers converted the frames of their footage into thousands of photos.

Using
editing tools, Menilmonde found shots where certain parts were 
empty and merged these empty regions onto the other images until all the
people and cars were removed.

They then ordered the images so it 
appeared the traffic lights were changing colour, or the wind was 
blowing through the trees.

Claire and Maxime from Menilmonde filmed timelapse shots of various locations around Paris before removing 'the life' from the City of Light.

'What if Paris was emptied,' explain the filmmakers. 'Imagine if the action of man was more harmful to our fragile planet.'

Paris.

The left image, shot from on top of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, shows the Champs Elysees with cars and people. The right-hand shot shows the Champs Elysees after all the cars and people had been removed

'To clear human activity, there's no need to use neutral
density filters or long exposures,' explain the filmmakers.

'You don't need to only film at 
6:00 am. All you need is a good tripod and a video camera, 
and to shoot a static scene for about around five minutes.'

The pair said the project was inspired by the Running on Empty video by Ross Ching. Ching's project emptied the main streets of Los Angeles in 2010 using timelapses.

The film uses sounds taken from free audio archives, as well as whispers recorded in a church, that were then reversed to add the eerie backing track.

Quotes about human life and space that run throughout are by Stephen Hawking.

This shows the area around Porte D'Orleans before and after editing. The short Hypocentre film contains over 7,500 photos stitched together. Once the life had been removed, the images were orded so it appeared traffic lights were changing colour, or the wind was blowing through the trees
