The family of Eric Garner, who died after a police officer placed him in a chokehold, said Tuesday it was suing New York City and the NYPD for $75million, according to Agence France-Presse.

His death brought claims of police brutality after video showed the 43-year-old being choked by an officer while being arrested for selling loose cigarettes in July.

Garner, who was severely overweight and asthmatic, suffered a heart attack shortly after losing consciousness and was declared dead after being transferred to a hospital.

In the notice of claim sent to city comptroller Scott Stringer, the family blamed the death on 'negligence, recklessness and carelessness.'

The filing is the first step necessary to sue the city, and it also names eight officers and the NYPD in the claim.

In July, officers confronted Garner, who was selling untaxed cigarettes in the northeastern Staten Island neighborhood of Tompkinsville.

When Garner resisted attempts to arrest him, NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in a chokehold and along with several other officers, pushed him to the ground.

The man began to complain of having trouble breathing and died of a heart attack  

Chokeholds were banned by former NYPD chief Ray Kelly in 1993, though a report released Tuesday by the Civilian Complaint Review Board shows their use continues under different names.

In August, the city medical examiner ruled Garner's death a homicide, with compression of the neck and chest and the position of Garner's body causing his death.

Two days after Garner was killed, officer Pantaleo, an eight-year member of the NYPD, was stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty pending an internal NYPD investigation.

Staten Island residents and critics of NYPD's use of force tactics protested after Garner's death,

A grand jury in Staten Island is currently considering whether to bring charges against the officers.
