Nick Clegg yesterday demanded a £9billion tax raid on ‘serious unearned wealth’ to pay for tax cuts for low and middle income earners.

The Deputy Prime Minister pointed out that billionaire oligarchs with £20million properties do not pay much more council tax than people in homes worth a fraction of that price.

He also pushed for new taxes on air travel and pollution.

Time for a cut: Nick Clegg has implored the Government to adopt the Liberal Democrats' mansion tax to pay for tax cuts for middle and lower income earners

The Liberal Democrats are privately backing ‘super’ council tax bands above the current top band, I, which kicks in on homes which were worth more than £424,000 when the bands were created in 1991.

This is a variant of the party’s demand for a ‘mansion tax’ on properties worth more than £2million, which has been rejected by the Tories.

Mr Clegg insisted that his planned reforms were aimed at the super-rich. He said: ‘I know the mansion tax is controversial, but who honestly believes it is right that an oligarch pays just double the council tax of an average homeowner, even if their house is worth 100 times as much?

‘And who seriously thinks we would kill aspiration through a levy on the 0.1 per cent of the population who own £2million homes?

‘The mansion tax is right, it makes sense and the Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case for it. We’re going to stick to our guns.’ However, local government secretary Eric Pickles is opposed to  tinkering with council tax bands because he fears it will spark a nationwide revaluation process that the Tories have promised to avoid.

Mr Clegg said he did not want to discourage hard work by raising taxes on income, but added that those with ‘serious unearned wealth’ should be forced to pay their fair share.

‘The UK’s tax system cannot go on like this, with those at the top claiming the reliefs, enjoying the allowances, paying other people to find the loopholes, while everyone else pays through the nose,’ he said.

‘This is about fairness in the middle. More money in the pockets of the people who need it. We support taxes on unearned wealth, precisely to lighten taxes on the wages of the hard-working.’

The Lib Dem leader demanded that the Coalition go ‘further and faster’ in raising the threshold at which people pay income tax from £7,475 to £10,000 – which will cost £9billion. The current deadline for this is 2015. The Lib Dems are likely to go into the next election demanding that the threshold is increased again to £12,500 – at a potential cost of a further £10billion.

Mr Clegg said the changes are necessary because family finances have reached ‘a state of emergency’.

It is understood that he has already won the support of Chancellor George Osborne to close a tax loophole which allows the wealthy to dodge stamp duty when they move by taking homes into company assets – raising around £1 billion.

The Deputy Prime Minister also demanded a crackdown on tax avoidance and other allowances and reliefs enjoyed by the wealthiest in society, which he hopes will raise another £1billion.

Ideas man: Nick Clegg set out his vision for a fairer Britain today

To make up the other £7billion, Mr Clegg said the Government should increase green taxes and crack down on the property assets of the richest in Britain.

Business Secretary Vince Cable announced plans for an annual tax on expensive homes while in opposition.

The policy would see owners of properties worth £2m or more pay an annual levy of one per cent of the property's value.

It would raise an estimated £1.7bn a year from Britain's 40-50,000 homes worth more than the benchmark £2m figure.

The idea was fiercely opposed by some in the Tory party who believe it will hit families and older people whose wealth is tied up in their homes.

However Mr Cable has spoken recently of his desire to introduce the tax at the next Budget.

In a speech to the Resolution Foundation think-tank, Mr Clegg said: ‘This will necessitate reform across the tax system, so that those who are better off, or who act in ways that damage our environment, pay their fair share.’

A senior Lib Dem source: ‘Property is pretty much the only asset that cannot be moved or hidden away.’ Sources said green taxes would not be imposed on motoring but would target airline flights.

In the past the Chancellor has funded a rise in the basic rate income tax threshold by lowering the level at which people start paying the 40p rate. That has dragged hundreds of thousands of people into higher rate tax.

Tories are concerned that the effect of doing this again will be that more parents will lose their child benefit under Mr Osborne’s plans to strip the handout from families with one higher rate taxpayer from 2013. 

Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Finally Nick Clegg has woken up to the squeezing of people on middle incomes, but the problem is who squeezed the middle?

‘It is this Government that has put up VAT, this Government that is cutting tax credits and this Government that is allowing energy companies to rip people off on their bills.

‘I don’t think people are going to trust Nick Clegg or this Government to help the squeezed middle.’

Nice to meet you: IMF boss Christine Lagarde with George Osborne yesterday - the latter has some work to do to stabilise Britain's economy

The odds on Britain experiencing a second mild recession, before the nation has fully recovered from the downturn of 2009, have increased.

The disclosure that output tumbled by 0.2per cent in the final months of last year will be a huge disappointment to George Osborne as he brazens it out with his policy of budget austerity. 

But the setback is by no means the disaster which Labour, the unions and parts of the media would want us to believe.

Unlike
large swathes of the eurozone, the UK emerged from 2011 with the 
economy growing at 0.9 per cent. The interest rate of British government
bonds is at its lowest level in decades and the claimant count for 
unemployment – the number of people signing up for the dole – is easing 
after several months of rises.

Clearly, the Chancellor was way off the mark when he predicted in March that the recovery would take hold in 2011.

But
no one could have predicted that the Arab Spring would keep oil prices 
high. Or that Spain, Italy and France would be sucked into the single 
currency debt crisis.

The
final quarter of 2011 was a mixed bag. Services, which make up more 
than 70 per cent of the nation’s output, were flat but picked up in the 
final weeks of the year. That should carry over into 2012. Output was 
driven down by industrial production and construction which both 
slumped. Manufacturing and exports were held back by a lack of demand 
from the European Union.

Bizarrely,
just as cold weather disrupted growth in 2010, warm weather was ruinous
over the last few months lowering the demand for energy from power 
stations.

Fears of a second recession will put pressure on the Government to do more to stave off further misery for ordinary households.

The weapon likely to be deployed is a new round of printing money by the Bank of England.

Osborne
will face calls to stimulate demand with tax cuts. The impact of 
cutting payroll taxes (the equivalent of national insurance) in the 
U.S., where the economy has taken off strongly and unemployment has 
dropped, illustrates one method of getting people back to work.

Little
impact has been seen from Osborne’s promises of lifting infrastructure 
spending and providing credit schemes to help businesses.

The
latest CBI survey suggests that business is not entirely moribund. But 
for the Chancellor to sit around, like Mr Micawber, and hope something 
turns up is not an option.

He needs to get on the front foot with bold tax reductions aimed at boosting growth and jobs.
