A hotel that was meant to host a seminar run by U.S. 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc has cancelled his appearance after a petition that attracted more than 10,000 signatures called for the move.

The change.org petition attracted more than 11,000 signatures and asked the hotel to ditch Thursday's seminar.

Mr Blanc has made a name for himself being what he describes as an 'executive coach' at a company called Real Social Dynamics, which he calls an 'international leader in dating advice'.

U.S. 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc is in Australia to teach men how to pick up women at seminars

The petition was started by U.S. woman Jennifer Li who labelled Mr Blanc's pick-up techniques as 'sexist' and 'racist'.

'Julien Blanc... has made a living by teaching men how to violate women through physical and emotional abuse,' she wrote on the petition.

Ms Li went on to say the hotel should not soil its good name by associating with 'a man who chokes women around the world as part of his pick up game'. 

She asked the hotel to stand up for the women of Australia and around the world and not to host the event which would teach other men 'how to violate and harass women'.

And the hotel seems to have received her message.

On Tuesday, The Como Melbourne tweeted it would be cancelling Mr Blanc's seminar.

'Following an objective review, we are in the process of advising Real Social Dynamics of our decision not to proceed as their event venue,' the hotel wrote. 

Twitter users commended the hotel's decision. 

Mr Blanc spreads his dating tips via videos posted online. 

One of the techniques he uses is going up to a girl and chocking them and then hushing them up

In June the 'dating coach' was charging men $3,000 each to attend one of his seminars in Miami

The Como Melbourne have ditched his Thursday seminar after the petition attracted more than 11,000 signatures

He is known for his confronting pick-up techniques, which include walking up to a woman and choking her then hushing them up.

Earlier this year in June, the 'dating coach' charged men $3,000 each to attend a seminar in Miami. 

The 25-year-old has already landed on Australia shores in Sydney and gave a talk earlier this week. 

Sian Mann thanked The Como Melbourne for making the move to scrap the seminar

'Good for you... u may just have indirectly saved someone from horror ordeal,' BFavell wrote

The Como even won over some customers by making the decision to cancel the event

Mr Blanc said he started in the pick up game when he read the novel The Game written by Neil Strauss

On his website, Mr Blanc said his interest in picking up girls started when he read The Game - a novel written by Neil Strauss.

In the book, Strauss documents his time learning about picking up women with a secret society of people led by a man only known as 'Mystery'.

'I wasn't a popular kid, and it sucked. But it didn't "really" bother me, until one day I... found a link to The Game,' Mr Blanc wrote on his website, Pimp.

'I read a few pages of it and I was HOOKED. I had to try this whole "walking up and talking to girls I’ve never met before and make them want to sleep with me" thing out... I was so off at first."

Mr Blanc has been contacted by Daily Mail Australia for comment.
