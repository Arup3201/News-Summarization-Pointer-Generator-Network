It may not be as physical as sports such as American Football and Ice Hockey.

However, that didn't stop this enormous brawl from breaking out during a baseball game last night.

The huge bench-clearing bust-up took place during a game between Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres.

Fight: A huge bench-clearing bust-up took place during a match between Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres last night shortly after Dodgers' Zack Greinke, left, pitched the ball towards Carlos Quentin, right

Trouble: After Greinke pitched the ball towards Quentin it smashed into his left shoulder

Aggressive: After Greinke appeared to say something, Quentin then charged towards him sparking the massive brawl

Dodgers pitcher Zack Greinke pitched the ball towards Carlos Quentin but it smashed into his left shoulder.

The slugger started walking toward the 
mound and, after Greinke appeared to say something, Quentin then charged towards him.

Both
players then wrestled with each other before hitting the ground. Up to 100 players and staff from both sides quickly rushed in, trying to separate the 
pair.

When they were finally pulled apart, 
Quentin was led off the field by a teammate and Greinke walked off toward
the Dodgers' dugout.  

Unhappy: The brawl was sparked following this confrontation

Anger: Dodgers pitcher Zack Greinke pitched the ball towards Carlos Quentin but it smashed into his left shoulder. This resulted in Quentin charging into Greinke

Out of control: As the two players wrestled with each other, players from both teams ran onto the field

Crazy: Quentin and Greinke quickly hit the floor as the brawl developed

Both players have a well documented 
history with each other.  Greinke has hit Quentin twice with pitches 
when they were in the American League.

Speaking to the Miami Herald, Quentin 
said: 'I've been hit by many pitches, for the amount I have been hit 
and my hitting style, I'm going to repeat: I have never reacted that 
way.'

Greinke said he never intended to hit Quentin. 'He always 
seems to think that I'm hitting him on purpose, but that's not the 
case.'

However, even after the initial brawl, the teams again began fighting.

Wild: The crowd could be heard frantically cheering as the two teams battled with each other

Chaos: The fight resulted in staff from both benches running onto the field

Dramatic: This image shows just how chaotic the brawl became

Bench-clearing: Players and staff from both teams ran from all corners of the ground to join in the brawl

After the teams started going back to 
the dugouts and bullpens, Dodgers' player Jerry Hairston Jr. came running across the 
field yelling and pointing at someone in the San Diego dugout. He quickly had to
be restrained.

Players from both teams again emptied the benches and went running to the scene of the trouble.

Quentin, Kemp and Hairston were eventually ejected from the game and play resumed after a delay of about 15 minutes.

Worrying: The fight resulted in players rushing from the benches

Following the game, it was announced that Greinke had broken his collarbone.

The right-hander joined the
Dodgers as a free agent in the off-season and signed a massive $147 million, 
six-year contract.

However, the anger had not subsided when the players left the field.

the game.

Other players again joined in to try and prevent the brawl 
breaking out again.

Los Angeles eventually went on to a 3-2 victory.
