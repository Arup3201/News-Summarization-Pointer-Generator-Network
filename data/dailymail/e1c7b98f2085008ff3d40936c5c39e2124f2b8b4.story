New mothers should be taught about the risks of sleeping with their babies to try to cut the number of babies who die from cot death, health officials said.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said families should learn about safe sleeping habits for babies to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (Sids).

About 250 babies die from Sids every year in England and Wales.

In new draft recommendations, Nice said that all parents should be made aware of the link between cot death and falling asleep with a baby up to the age of one.

Midwives, GPs and health visitors should also make parents aware that the risks are significantly higher if parents drink, smoke or take drugs, the guidance states.

Babies born prematurely or with a low birth weight are at an increased risk of cot death if they sleep with their parents.

'Falling asleep with a baby, whether that’s in a bed or on a sofa or chair, is risky,' said Nice’s clinical practice director professor Mark Baker.

'It’s imperative that all parents and carers know about the association between sudden infant death syndrome and falling asleep with a child under the age of one.

'This is especially important if parents drink alcohol, take drugs or expose their baby to tobacco smoke.'

He added: 'There is no universal agreement on the causes of sudden infant death syndrome.

'We know there is a link between Sids and falling asleep with a baby in a bed or on a sofa or chair, but studies into why this happens can often give conflicting results. And other factors are likely to play a part in increasing the risk to the infant.

'We recognise that some parents may choose to share a bed with their baby because it could make breastfeeding easier, or for cultural reasons. Or they may be forced to co-sleep because they may not have the space or money for a cot.

'This is why it’s so important for parents to understand what the risks are. The recommendations we are developing aim to help healthcare professionals inform parents and carers of the likely risks associated with co-sleeping, according to the best available evidence.'

The Nice guidance has been put out for consultation until the end of the month.
