The Australian Tax office has stepped in to reclaim a chunk of money owed to them by a former businessman involved in an alleged offshore money laundering scheme.

Despite being in a prime location, the ATO has slashed the asking price in half of former Murchison Metals director and Sydney Swans backer, Phillip Grimaldi's Sydney penthouse.

Originally purchased by Grimaldi in 2007 for $3.5 million the stunning top-floor apartment on Hickson Road in Sydney was listed by Grimaldi for $4 million last year.

However, after failing to attract a buyer, the tax office took over and it has listed the property for a bargain price of $2.6 million. 

Grimaldi made headlines in 2009 for becoming involved in a Vanuatu-based money laundering scheme.

He was subsequently hit with a $36 million tax bill as part of Project Wickenby, the nation's largest tax probe.

It was thought the business mogul had more than $55 million sitting in bank accounts in Australia and New Zealand, as well as tens of millions of shares in listed Australian companies.

Grimaldi was able to avoid tax by transferring millions of dollars through a number of New Zealand bank accounts. 

The money was then sent back to his Australian account and disguised as a consultancy fee, management fee or insurance premium.
