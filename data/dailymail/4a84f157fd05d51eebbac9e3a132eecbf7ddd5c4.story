In the grip of illness: Georgia Willson-Pemberton's weight plummeted as her life was gradually destroyed by anorexia

Blessed with brains as well as beauty, Georgia Willson-Pemberton appeared to have it all.

But the one-time child ski champion’s life was gradually destroyed by anorexia and a deadly addiction to laxatives, her despairing family told yesterday.

After a four-year battle with the eating  disorder, the former head girl of a private school died following an overdose of over-the-counter laxative pills, which caused ‘catastrophic’ organ failure.

Her weight had plunged to less than seven stone – desperately low for a 26-year-old woman who stood at 5ft 11in.

But in the grip of anorexia, she had continued to take laxatives, buying more than 6,000 over the internet from supermarkets.

Her father Robert, 62, sobbed as he told her inquest how he was helpless to save his ‘hugely intelligent’ daughter.

‘The
world was her oyster, she could have done anything,’ he said. ‘Her 
ambition just disappeared. This disease just consumed her. That’s all 
she thought about.’

Her 
worried parents paid for treatment at several of the world’s leading 
eating disorder centres, including a three-month stay at the Monte Nido 
Centre in California, which charges up to £33,000 a month and has 
treated celebrities including Ally McBeal actress Portia de Rossi.

But
Miss Willson-Pemberton continued to lose weight and died in hospital in
December after collapsing at her parents’ £2million home in Putney, 
south-west London.

She told doctors she had taken 50 
laxatives several days earlier and surgeons at the Chelsea and 
Westminster Hospital found her gullet, stomach, small intestine and 
liver had been irreparably damaged.

Intensive
care consultant Michelle Hayes said she believed the ‘catastrophic 
organ damage’ was caused by the overdose and long-term ‘chronic laxative
abuse’.

Miss 
Willson-Pemberton had been a star pupil at the £29,000-a-year Heathfield
School in Ascot, Berkshire, becoming head girl as well  as a junior 
skiing gold medallist  in national championships.

She
was pictured with her mother Elizabeth on the website of ‘society 
bible’ magazine Tatler, and her brother Alexander, 29, reportedly 
attended a prestigious cookery school with Pippa Middleton.

She
developed anorexia in 2008 while studying for a degree in international
marketing at the European Business School in central London.

'Hugely intelligent': Georgia Willson-Pemberton spent four years 'in and out' of hospital as she battled anorexia

Miss Willson-Pemberton gained weight 
as an inpatient at centres in the US and Britain, including the Priory 
rehabilitation clinics and Life Works in Woking, Surrey, but she never 
lost her fear of eating and learned how to deceive doctors.

During
one stay in the Priory she smuggled in 200 laxative pills inside a 
padded bra, and she worked out methods of influencing weigh-ins and 
blood test results.

She also
began drinking heavily and hid vodka bottles underneath her parents’ 
sofa and behind a radiator at one treatment centre.

Her mother nursed her at home after she became ‘too clever’ at fooling doctors.

Mrs
Willson-Pemberton, 61, was praised as a ‘brilliant’ carer who could 
spot her daughter’s tricks, but ultimately could not save her.

Mr 
Willson-Pemberton, a company director, said the eating disorder had 
taken over the family’s life, adding: ‘I know she felt guilty for what 
she was doing to us but through it all she was just a loving child.

‘We
couldn’t understand, bearing in mind the privileges in life she had 
had, how she had managed to get to this point. We did everything in our 
power to try to sort it out.’

After
her death, her parents discovered she had bought more than 6,000 
laxative pills online, which were delivered to her flat in South 
Kensington, west London.

Her father questioned why she had been able to buy so many without any checks, such as those in place for buying painkillers.

Assistant
deputy coroner Darren Stewart said he did not believe  the overdose was
a suicide attempt. Recording a narrative verdict, he said Miss 
Willson-Pemberton had died after the overdose caused multiple organ 
failure.
