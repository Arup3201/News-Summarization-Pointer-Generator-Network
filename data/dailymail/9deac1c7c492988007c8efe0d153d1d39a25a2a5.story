Volunteers and law enforcement agents searching for kidnapped 12-year-old Missouri girl discovered a body Wednesday afternoon believed to be the missing Adriuanna Horton.

News of the tragic find in the Golden City area came just before 4pm, but Sgt. Jason Pace, of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, would not say where or when the body was found, or how the victim died.

Officials have yet to confirm that the remains were those of Horton pending a positive identification, but the girl's father said his daughter was found dead more than 24 hours after she was allegedly snatched from a local park by a family acquaintance.

According to James Horton, a search party came across the body at around 2.30pm, the station KSPR reported. 

Bobby
 D. Bourne Jr., 34, of Lockwood, was charged with kidnapping Adriaunna 
and booked into a jail Tuesday night in Barton County on $1million bond.

Bourne
 was taken into custody Monday evening after being found in a vehicle 
that witnesses said had picked up Adriaunna Horton at a Golden City park
 about 90 minutes earlier.

Officers from than a dozen agencies were searching for Adriaunna.

The girl's father, Golden City resident James Horton, said Bourne had once worked for him and that their children played together.

Adriaunna's mother, Wendi Jackson, traveled to Golden City from her home in Overland Park, Kansas, and said she feels ‘lost.’

‘You always want your baby to be in your arms, to know she's safe and at home and not lost and cold,’ Jackson tearfully said.

The station KSPR reported that Adriaunna, her 8-year-old sister, Lydia, and two friends went to Hazel’s Park next to their home Monday afternoon after the first day of school.

According to the missing girl's sister, Bobby Bourne drove up to the girls three times while they were playing in the park.

Wendi Jackson, Adriaunna's mother, said that the 34-year-old man asked to girls for help with finding his own daughters.

'Adriaunna told the other girls to stay away and she went to see what was up,' Miss Jackson told The Kansas City Star.

When Adriaunna's sister, turned around, the 12-year-old was gone.

At around 5pm Monday, the girls' father, James Horton, called 911 to report his daughter missing.

About two hours later, at around 6.30pm, Bobby Bourne was found in his truck by police on the other side of town. The man was alone in the vehicle.

Velma Horton, Adriaunna's grandmother, told the press that Bourne and her son had done home repairs together, and at one time the 34-year-old was their neighbor.

The grandmother added that she did not believe her granddaughter would have willingly gotten into Bourne's car.

‘She wouldn’t get into a car with anyone,’ Velma Horton told Joplin Globe. ‘She would say she had to go ask her father, or me or her grandfather, first.’

Records show that Bourne has been on probation after getting a suspended sentence for assault and domestic assault in 2012.

On Monday night, more than a dozen law enforcing agencies and search and rescue groups sent out hundreds of people to look for the missing girl.

Volunteers scoured the area surrounding Hazel’s Park on horseback, in all-terrain vehicles, and using helicopters and dogs, while officers spent Tuesday canvassing the entirety of Golden city - a town of fewer than 800 people.

‘We are going to stay at this as long as it takes,’ said Barton County Sheriff Mitchell Shaw.
