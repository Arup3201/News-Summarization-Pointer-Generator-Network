Furious MPs are in revolt over a decision to sell off the House of Commons silver – to save a ‘paltry’ £200 a week.

Some of the silver-plated cutlery used in Commons dining rooms could be sold to tourists as souvenirs and replaced by stainless steel knives and forks made in Vietnam.

A leaked report obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveals a plan to strip the new cutlery of the traditional Commons portcullis logo to deter visitors from stealing them.

Faded: The silver cutlery used in the dining rooms at the House of Commons

A report accepted by the Commons Administration Committee says the move will save nearly £50,000 over the next five years – £10,000 a year or just under £200 a week.

But Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is leading a battle to get the decision overturned, said: ‘Selling off Westminster’s family silver to save a paltry £10,000 a year is taking cheeseparing to ridiculous lengths.

‘There is a fundamental triviality about trying to save this sort of money when we are told we need to find £3 billion to restore the Palace.

‘Dignitaries who come here rightly expect to use silver-plated cutlery – not something one stop short of plastic forks and polystyrene cups.’

Commons catering chiefs claim it costs too much to maintain silver cutlery and insist a new £17,000 stainless steel set – made in Vietnam or Taiwan – will not ‘compromise on class or elegance’.

In a report they told MPs: ‘Our silver cutlery must be sent back to the manufacturer for refurbishment annually and burnished weekly (rubbed and cleaned) to maintain its finish. This process is costly, labour intensive and it is becoming more difficult to maintain the cutlery to an acceptable standard.’

The officials say it would cost £72,400 over five years to keep the silver cutlery, including:

By contrast, a new stainless steel set will cost £17,000 to buy and £6,800 to replace items that go missing. 

When the £880 profit from selling off a few worn pieces of silver cutlery for scrap is accounted for, it produces a saving of about £47,000. But that does not include the potential profit from selling some of the silver cutlery through Commons gifts shops, which officials are looking at.

The report says ‘the best’ of the silver cutlery will be kept for ‘MP dining clubs, a Member’s wedding breakfast etc’.

MPs on the committee voted to keep the portcullis logo and have asked catering chiefs to look at buying cutlery made in the UK.
