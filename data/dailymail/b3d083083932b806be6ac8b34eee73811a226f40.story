Steven Dunn, of Burton, Staffs, was banned for four years after he was caught driving drunk on the school run

A father driving his two young sons home from school was more than three times over the drink-drive limit.

Steven Dunn, 32, consumed a ‘vast amount of alcohol’ the night before and downed five more cans of lager that afternoon, magistrates at Burton, Staffordshire, heard.

Dunn was banned for four years after he was caught driving with his sons, six and eight, in the back seat.

Emma Thompson, prosecuting, said: 'He had his two sons in the car when he was pulled over.

'It quickly became apparent that he was unfit through drink. He was more than three times the drink-driving limit.'

Dunn, of Stapenhill, Burton, claimed he felt ‘fit to drive’ even though he had been drinking for four hours straight that afternoon and had eaten nothing all day.

The two boys were picked up from Burton Police Station by their mother after Dunn was arrested.

Magistrates heard the school was just ten minutes’ walk from the family home, but Dunn had decided to drive as he was running late.

Sonia Lawrence, defending, said her client had a ‘problem with alcohol’ and had been stashing it in his car to drink secretly.

Miss Lawrence said: 'He has been drinking to excess and has had a dependency for 12 months.

Dunn was pulled over while driving a Ford Fiesta. He was found to have 110 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath when tested. The legal limit is 35 micrograms. (File photo, similar to Dunn's car)

'His wife [the boys’ mother] would 
have been horrified if she had known the extent of his drinking and she 
was horrified to find he had been drinking and then picked up the 
children.'

Dunn’s wife is due to give birth to another child in 11 weeks’ time.

He was pulled over while driving his Ford Fiesta car in Stapenhill at around 4pm on April 30.

He was found to have 110 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath when tested. The legal limit is 35 micrograms.

Dunn, who was previously convicted of drink-driving in 2008, was sentenced to a 48-month ban and told to complete a 12-month community order and a drink-driving awareness programme.

Charges of being drunk in charge of a child and ill treatment of a child were withdrawn.

Dunn pleaded guilty to drink driving.
