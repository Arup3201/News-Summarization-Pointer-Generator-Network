Her debut comedy stand-up tour made almost £7 million.

And although it has been a monetary success for Miranda Hart it appears not to have been a personal one.

For the star yesterday revealed she did not enjoy her 49-show tour, because she gets stressed about performing on stage.

Revealing her fears about being in front of large audiences, Miss Hart, 41, said: ‘Stand-up, as a genre, doesn’t really suit my personality. I’m ultimately a bit of an introvert, and I found the pressure of just me in such vast arenas a bit overwhelming.’

Miss Hart’s tour, which took around the country and to Australia, involved dates at London’s O2 and the Manchester Arena, which are two of the UK’s largest indoor venues.

According to ticket sales tracker Pollstar, Miss Hart made at least £6.9 million from My What I Call Live Show. The figures have been collated from date for 33 shows, six of which were a sell-out. There were 49 shows in total with Miss Hart performing at various venues across the country including London’s O2

The popularity of the tour saw Miss Hart add eight new dates due to demand.

However appearing on Woman’s Hour yesterday, during a listeners’ interview session, Miss Hart said: ‘I found it very draining, physically, because I’m an introvert, so I don’t feed off the audi-ence, funnily enough. I find it quite stressful, and slightly embarrassing, weirdly. Even the curtain call – I thought, I’m gonna love the curtain call, and I did, because I was thrilled people loved the show. But I was only really doing it for them, not for me. It’s weird. Then it became an act, I was acting being a stand-up.’

Miss Hart received a string of glowing reviews from critics for her performance including the Daily Mail’s Christopher Stevens who noticed her nervs and lack of experience.

Commenting on her turn at the Bournemouth International Centre earlier this year, he said: ‘The crowd cheered her to the rafters: children with their aunties and grandmas, young couples, parties of pensioners, bunches of teenagers. Miranda’s appeal is as broad as that of showbiz veterans like Bruce Forsyth, which makes it all the more surprising she has never attempted an arena tour with a stand-up show before.

‘Unlike comics who have learned their trade in pubs and clubs, honing their repartee over years, she is a stand-up virgin.

‘Three nights into her British tour, her absence of confidence is obvious. A more experienced performer could have taken this adoring audience and had them convulsed with laughter. As it was, we were merely pleased.’

Miss Hart has since released a DVD of the tour, which is Amazon’s fifth most popular comedy DVD, and 18th bestselling DVD overall.

Admitting to enjoying at least parts of the tour, Miss Hart said on Woman’s Hour: ‘I found it a hell of a thing. It was extraordinary, I announced it and decided to do it 18 months before I did it. I didn’t know what I would think of it and I enjoyed being in the room with you lovely people who supported me and the show.’

Earlier this year Miss Hart announced she was quitting her sitcom Miranda so as to ‘end on a high’, after a Christmas finale.

The comedienne, whose slapstick routine has made her one of the most popular entertainers, said she didn’t want her character to ‘keep falling over and make a complete fool of herself.

Miss Hart was educated at the Duchess of Cambridge’s old public school, Downe House. She is the elder daughter of naval officer David Hart Dyke, 72 — whose destroyer HMS Coventry was sunk in the Falklands War.
