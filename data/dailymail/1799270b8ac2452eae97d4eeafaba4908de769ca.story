During a visit to a facility of leading Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd last year, U.S. inspectors found that a black fiber embedded in a tablet may have been a hair from an employee's arm, according to documents seen by Reuters.

That and other quality concerns led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to impose an 'import alert' on its Mohali plant last week, saying the factory owned by India's biggest drugmaker by sales had not ensured manufacturing quality.

Ranbaxy, which is 63.5 per cent-owned by Japan's Daiichi Sankyo Co and gets more than 40 per cent of its sales from the U.S., did not immediately respond to a request on Wednesday for comment on the FDA observations.

Ranbaxy manufactures a wide range of drugs available in the U.S. that fight Alzheimer's, cholesterol, pain, allergies, and gastrointestinal and cardiovascular issues.

The FDA's action has dealt another blow 
to an Indian generic drug industry battered by a rash of American 
regulatory rebukes and as U.S. demand for generics grows, especially 
under President  Obama's new healthcare program.

The import alert issued to Ranbaxy prohibits it from making FDA-regulated drugs at the Mohali facility and selling them in the United States until its methods, facilities and controls are in compliance with good manufacturing standards.

The unexpected import ban on the Mohali facility sent shares in Ranbaxy plunging by one-third on Monday, and comes just a few months after it pleaded guilty to U.S. felony charges related to drug safety and agreed to $500 million in fines.

It brings under sanction all three of Ranbaxy's plants in India dedicated to supplying the United States, and followed FDA inspections in September and December last year.

During one of the inspections, the FDA concluded that a black fiber embedded in a tablet was likely either 'tape remnants on the nozzle head of the machine or a hair from an employee's arm that could be exposed on loading the machine', the documents showed.

According to the FDA, the ban means that U.S. officials may detain drugs manufactured at Ranbaxy Laboratories facility in Mohali, India.

'The FDA is committed to using the full extent of its enforcement authority to ensure that drugs made for the U.S. market meet federally mandated quality standards,' said Howard Sklamberg, director of the Office of Compliance in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in a statement.

'We want American consumers to be confident that the drugs they are taking are of the highest quality.'

Ranbaxy had said on Tuesday it would 
review the details of the FDA import alert and take 'all necessary steps
to resolve the concerns' at the earliest.

'The
USFDA had conducted inspections at Ranbaxy's Mohali facility in 2012, 
resulting in certain observations,' Ranbaxy said in the statement. '

The 
company believes that it has made further improvements at its Mohali 
facility ... and remains committed to addressing all concerns of the 
USFDA.'

The Mohali plant, 
in the northern state of Punjab, had not been making U.S. exports since 
last November, when it voluntarily recalled its generic version of 
cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor in the United States due to the 
potential presence of glass particles in certain batches.

The
FDA's ban of U.S. shipments from the Mohali plant was unexpected as the
facility is relatively new and accounted for 50 per cent of new generic 
drug filings by Ranbaxy, said Sarabjit Kour Nangra, a sector analyst at 
Angel Broking.

The latest 
action against Ranbaxy came months after the FDA imposed an import ban 
on one of the plants of Wockhardt Ltd after inspectors found torn data 
records in a waste heap and urinals that emptied into an open drain in a
bathroom six meters from the entrance to a sterile manufacturing area.

Wockhardt
Chairman Habil Khorakiwala said this month the problem at its Waluj 
plant was 'an inexcusable lapse, but we have taken swift and definitive 
action, both corrective and pre-emptive'.

produces nearly 40 per cent of generic drugs and over-the-counter 
products and 10 perc ent of finished dosages used in the United States.

In March, India allowed the FDA to add seven inspectors, which will 
bring its staff in India to 19.

In
Ranbaxy's case, the FDA inspections in Mohali also found that a tablet 
was not within the specified weight limit, the FDA inspectors wrote.

Other findings by the FDA included use 
of dirty glassware, spots and abrasions on the surface of tablets and 
potential packaging line failure that resulted in unlabeled bottles sent
to pharmacies.

The latest
Ranbaxy import ban and a weak rupee may force Daiichi Sankyo to revise 
down full-year guidance when it announces first half earnings on October
31, Atsushi Seki, an analyst with Barclays Japan wrote in a report.

'It appears Ranbaxy still has problems that need to be resolved,' Seki wrote.

Ranbaxy has lost half its value from its highest level in 2008, when it was first hit by an import ban.

Ranbaxy Laboratories's Chief Executive Arun Sawhney is under pressure after inspectors from the U.S. government's Food and Drug Administration discovered suspected 'human hair' in a pill manufactured by the company. Ranbaxy Laboratories is a major exporter of generic drugs to the U.S.
