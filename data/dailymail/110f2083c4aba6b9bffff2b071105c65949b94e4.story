Swansea say they want £45million for Wilfried Bony, Michel Vorm and Ben Davies who have attracted interest from Tottenham and Liverpool.

Tottenham have opened talks over Davies but Swansea value him at £12m.

Striker Bony is now rated at £25m and Vorm around £8m.

Price tag: Wilfried Bony is valued at £25million by his club Swansea

Warmer: Michel Vorm is currently at the World Cup with Holland

Valued: Ben Davies has also been linked with a move away

Vorm is currently still at the World Cup with Holland, where he is backup to first-choice Jasper Cilllesen.

Bony, however, has already returned home after his two goals in three games could not prevent Ivory Coast's unfortunate group stage exit.

Davies, meanwhile, has been enjoying his summer off after Wales' failure to qualify.
