A British second-hand exchange is replacing the pound with virtual currency Bitcoin for three days in one of its stores, making it the first retail outlet in the UK to let customers receive the virtual coins for products.

CeX, the high street chain that buys, sells and exchanges technological and electronic products, is switching from the pound to digital currency Bitcoin exclusively in its store in the Sauchiehall area of Glasgow. 

While using Bitcoin to buy products is becoming increasingly common in stores and online in the UK, CeX will be the first outlet to pay out in the currency, meaning customers can earn the currency for the first time, by selling goods.

David Butler, commercial director at CeX said: 'It's really exciting to be at the centre of such an innovative trial. 

'In our store, the staff and customers live and breathe technology so it's only appropriate we looked at Bitcoin as a way for our customers to buy and sell electronic goods.

Not only does Bitcoin have a number of security and access benefits, but it is also gaining popularity amongst consumers the world over.

'While we are temporarily dropping the pound from our Glasgow store, at a time when Scottish Independence is high up on the news agenda, we are doing so to give customers a choice in how they trade with us.'

Bitcoin is an entirely virtual currency that works without the need for a central bank, and can be sent over the internet. 

Coins are transferred directly from person to person and are kept in a digital wallet that can be accessed on a computer or mobile device.

Creating new coins is done through a process called 'mining' where users are rewarded with new coins for verifying transactions that take place.

The process is open source and can therefore be used by anyone, with more and more mainstream businesses now accepting the currency as a form of payment. 

According to a report by The Why Forum, the number of Bitcoin transactions globally have increased tenfold in the last year, and are now worth more than £40 million.

Several pubs as well as some taxi companies around the UK have begun to accept the currency as a means of paying for goods. 

Part of the scheme is designed to highlight the pressing issue of Scottish independence, with the country going to the polls in September to vote on leaving the UK. 

CeX says this trial will offer an opportunity to show that the country could manage without the pound. Technology expert and writer Benjamin Cohen said: 'Interest and curiosity around peer-to-peer electronic payments and digital currencies is at an all time high because there are compelling benefits for both the merchant and consumer. 

'CeX's introduction is a reflection that the demand is there and also poses the question, do we need cash? CeX is giving its consumers a genuine way to test that theory. I'm eager to see the results of the trial.'

What is a bitcoin?

Bitcoins are basically just lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. 

They are the basic unit of a new online economy which runs independently of any company, bank, or government. 

Because bitcoins allow people to trade money without a third party getting involved, they have become popular with libertarians as well as technophiles, speculators — and criminals.

Who's behind the currency?

It's a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as Bitcoin began to attract widespread attention, but proponents say that doesn't matter; the currency obeys its own, internal logic.What's a bitcoin worth?Like any other currency, bitcoins are only worth as much as you and your counterpart want them to be. In its early days, boosters swapped bitcoins back and forth for minor favors or just as a game. One website even gave them away for free. As the market matured, the value of each bitcoin grew. At its height three months ago, a single bitcoin was valued at $1,200. On Tuesday, it was around $500.Is the currency widely used?That's debatable. Businesses ranging from blogging platform Wordpress to retailer Overstock have jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of media coverage, but it's not clear whether the currency has really taken off.

On the one hand, leading bitcoin payment processor BitPay works with more than 20,000 businesses — roughly five times more than it did last year.

On the other, the total number of bitcoin transactions has stayed roughly constant at between 60,000 and 70,000 per day over the same period, according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info.Is Bitcoin particularly vulnerable to counterfeiting?The Bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals' greed for the collective good.

A network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction.

The blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional bitcoin.

As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn't be an issue.
