Stanislas Wawrinka opened his ATP World Tour Finals campaign in stunning fashion with a straight-sets demolition of Tomas Berdych.

The Swiss took just 58 minutes to beat his out-of-sorts Czech opponent 6-1, 6-1 and go top of Group A, with world No 1 Novak Djokovic and US Open champion Marin Cilic due to face off later on Monday night.

Wawrinka had arrived here having won just one of his last five matches but there was no sign of that recent poor form as he earned an early break in the second game with a nervy Berdych firing a forehand wide.

Berdych, of the Czech Republic, has not won any of his opening matches at the O2 Arena in London

Berdych has never won his opening match at the O2 Arena and it quickly looked to be heading that way again as a deep return by Wawrinka secured the double break for 4-0.

Wawrinka had a set point for a first-serve bagel but Berdych saved with an ace and finally got on the board, before Wawrinka held to wrap up the first set in just 25 minutes.

Things got no better for Berdych in the second set as a lengthy third game ended with Wawrinka claiming the break courtesy of his trademark one-handed backhand which was too powerful for Berdych to get back.

Wawrinka's victory earned him 200 ranking points as he fightsto keep his place in the world top four 

Wawrinka then reeled off the next four games in quick succession to clinch victory, as well as 200 ranking points which will prove handy as he bids to retain his place in the world's top four.

Wawrinka said: 'I didn't expect to win that easy in the score, for sure. But I was ready to play well.

'I had a great week of preparation. I worked really, really hard [in the last] few weeks with Magnus [Norman, his coach].

'Even if the result wasn't there in Basel and Paris, I was feeling the ball really well on the practice court.'

The good news for Czech fans is that Berdych has always gone on to win his second match at the ATP World Tour Finals, but the world No 7 will have to drastically improve in his next match on Wednesday if he is to continue that particular streak.

Berdych said: 'Unfortunately it was my worst match of the season and I kept it for the start here in the World Tour Finals.'
