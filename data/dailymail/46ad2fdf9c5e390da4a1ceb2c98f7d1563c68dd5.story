An imposter posing as a former Pakistan cricket star and repeatedly conned the BBC into paying him to appear on air as a pundit.

Nadeem Alam posed as ex-batsman Nadeem Abbasi on BBC World News, BBC Asian Network and Radio Five Live, despite only ever playing for his home town of Huddersfield. 

His work even included a discussion with former Indian batsman Aakash Chopra. 

Now, Mr Abbasi is furious after becoming aware of the fraudster's antics - and blasted the Corporation for not checking their facts.

Fake: Nadeem Alam repeatedly convinced the BBC he was as Pakistani cricket star Nadeem Abbasi 

Mr Abbasi, who has played three Tests for Pakistan in 1989, is furious that the pretender has damaged his country's reputation and plans to punch him if they ever meet, The Sun reported.

He told the newspaper : 'If I ever find Nadeem Alam, I will punch him in the face for damaging the country's reputation.'

The 46-year-old, who now coaches a team in Rawalpindi, added: 'The BBC is a big institution and surely they must check?'

He added his only media appearance was on Pakistani television during the World Cup in 1996.

He will take some comfort in Mr Alam's reassurance that he is 'no longer pretending to be Nadeem Abbasi'.

But Mr Alam added that he believes his opinions have been 'good'.

The 46-year-old, who has admitted posing as a squash player to blag free equipment, told The Sun: 'I like to think I have been talking good cricket.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'We apologise to the real Mr Abbasi and we will be looking seriously into what has happened.'
