Adnan Syed was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 2000 when he was 18

'Serial' may be over, but the true-crime case that gripped the nation seems far from shut after Asia McClain  yesterday reasserted she was with convicted murderer Adnan Syed at the exact time Baltimore prosecutors said he killed his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 1999.

In an affidavit published by the The Blaze, Ms McClain stated that she now realized 'her importance to the case' and felt she needed to make her story 'known to the court system'.  

'The Asia letters' were first revealed on the popular podcast 'Serial', which followed longtime radio producer and former Baltimore Sun reporter Sarah Koenig's year-long investigation into Syed's case.

The 12-episode series became a national obsession with over five million downloads as people tuned in every Thursday to listen as Ms Koening reported her findings in almost real-time hour-long segments.

In one such segment it was reported that Ms McClain had written Syed two letters following his arrest, stating that he had been in the public library near their high school on the day Ms Lee was murdered.

Prosecutors claimed Ms Lee had been dead by 2.36pm, but Ms McClain stated she remembered talking with Syed from 2.20 to 2.40pm.

Ms McClain, now 33, did not stand as a witness in Syed's 2000 trial, where he was convicted of first-degree murder and given a life sentence plus 30 years.

She said she was never contacted by his defense attorney Cristina Guttierrez, and she did not write an affidavit until  Syed's family friend Rabia Chaudry approached her after the trial.

Syed, now 34, brought up the 'Asia letters' during a 2012 appeal hearing, but the case's original prosecutor Kevin Urick testified that Ms McClain had called him and said the affidavit was written under pressure from Syed's family. 

Ms McClain refutes this claim in her new affidavit. 'I never told Urick that I recanted my story or affidavit about January 13, 1999,' it states.

'In addition, I did not write the March 1999 letters or the affidavit because of pressure from Syed's family.'

Ms McClain has claimed she was unsure what to do after she was contacted by Syed's defense team in 2010 and was unaware of 'how weak' the state's case was in regard to their evidence and testimony.

McClain also claimed that she called  Mr Urick to get more information about how to proceed and he convinced her not to participate in any legal proceedings.

It was only after she listened to 'Serial' and heard what Ms Koening had discovered that Ms McClain realized her importance to the case and decided to contact Syed's current lawyer to state her story in court, she told The Baltimore Sun. 

Mr Urick, now a private attorney, said on Tuesday that he stood by his 2012 testimony and that he had never tried to convince Ms McClain not to testify on behalf of Syed - although he did say he had told her that the evidence against Syed was 'strong'.

Ms McClain also refuted Mr Urick's claim that she had told him she wrote her original affidavit (pictured) under pressure from Syed's family 

This month a Baltimore City Circuit Court denied Syed's most recent appeal, which stated that his attorney Ms Gutierrez had neglected to reach out to Ms McClain as a key witness.

The court said this 'was the result of a sound and reasonable defense strategy'  both because Ms McClain's letters did not specify the time she saw Syed in the library, and because they contradicted his version of events that day.

Syed has appealed the circuit court’s decision to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals.
