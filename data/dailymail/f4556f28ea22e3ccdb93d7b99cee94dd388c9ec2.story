Rod
Stewart's ex-wife has revealed for the first time that she was raped at knife point when she
was 18 years old.

Alana Hamilton Stewart, a former
model, was attacked at knifepoint after an intruder broke into her home in
Texas.

Hamilton, 67,
who was married to Stewart for five years, described the assault as
"shameful and humiliating.'

She
said: 'It was such a shameful thing even then, and it always is no matter
how it happens because a woman always thinks it is never going to happen to
her.

'When
it does happen, it is such a humiliating and shameful thing. Back in those
days, when the Texas police came, they made me feel like I had done something
wrong that I had let this person in or I had known them.'

Hamilton,
now 67, told Fox News 'It was so shameful I never told anyone until years
later. It was so painful that I just stuffed it down, but it was a
transformational moment for me because it is what gave me the real push just to
get out of Texas and move to New York and start a new life.

'I had
wanted to get away from my mother and her drug addiction, so when that happened
it was the final straw.”

Hamilton
talks about the rape in her autobiography 'Rearview Mirror'.

The ex-model refers her first husband George Hamilton as a 'terrific man' and is still friends with the actor.

She also
tells how she was left devastated when her married to Stewart broke up after he
fell in love with model Kelly Emberg.

'I had three small children and I was raising them all on my own and I still hadn’t dealt with a lot of my own demons so I don’t think I was emotionally as present as I wish I had been.

'I think I instilled good values in my children, and I always loved them and I was always there for them and still am, but I always feel like I could have been a better parent.'

Hamilton
had wed Stewart in 1979 and they had two children, Kimberley and Sean.

She
writes:'After my marriage to Rod broke up, I was at the lowest point in my
life. I was absolutely devastated by the breakup of my marriage. It was so hard
to pick up the pieces, everything in my life I had tried to run from just
suddenly came bubbling up to the surface.'

Stewart was
best friends with Charlie's Angels star Farah Fawcett and was with her when she
died from cancer in 2009 after a long battle against the disease.

She said: 'I had never experienced watching someone you love, slowly die. In the
beginning we never thought she was going to die – she was so strong and full of
life. She and everyone around her thought she was going to beat this thing, I
was sure she was going to beat it.'

In his recent autobiography, Rod Stewart described the dizzying social scene which Alana introduced him to at the end of the 1970s.

She was a tall, long-legged and blonde former air hostess and model with the most fantastic smile.

And she had incredible connections that took me, blinking rather wildly, into a social world to which I never thought I’d belong.

While in Hollywood, hoping to make it as an actress, Alana had met and married George Hamilton.

They separated in 1975, three years earlier.

During her time with him, Alana had exploded onto the Hollywood social scene — and now, at 33, seemed to know absolutely everyone who was anyone.

Growing up in Nacogdoches in Texas, the model left for New York soon after her rape ordeal.

Her one-time husband, Stewart recalled their early years and how they married after she became pregnant with their first child, Kimberly.

'There was no big romantic proposal, no going down on bended knee — just a joint decision that this was the right thing to do,' said the rock-star.

Describing their life together as one long surreal party, the ex-Faces frontman spoke the rarified world of celebrity Alana introduced him to.

'This was our Great Gatsby period. On the guest list would be people such as Barbra Streisand, Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson, Anjelica Huston, Albert Finney, Linda Evans, Joan and Jackie Collins, Ryan O’Neal and Farrah Fawcett, to whom Alana was very close . . . it just went on and on,' said Rod.

People say: ‘What were all those guys like?’ Well, they all seemed great to me, but, of course, I saw them only when most of us were drunk or stoned and I never saw them the morning after.'

Falling pregnant with their second son Sean very soon after Kimberly was born, Alana and Rod's relationship began to fall apart.

'So now we had two wonderful children, and a fabulous social life, and wealth and happiness, and so much to be grateful for . . . yet it all began to go wrong,' said Rod.

'The main bones of contention were: my friends, my love of football and the amount of time I spent working.

'I was less sympathetic than I might have been. I was full of energy and I wanted her to keep up with me,' said Rod Stewart.

'So, typically, I’d go off to play football with my mates on a Sunday.

'Then maybe the team would have a bit of a drink afterwards, and by the time I got back it would be mid-afternoon, the lunch would be dried up in the oven and Alana would be steaming with fury.

Their marriage eventually disintegrated in 1987 with the singer buying his now ex-wife and two children a home in Los Angeles.
