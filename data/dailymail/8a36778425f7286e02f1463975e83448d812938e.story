Anyone who has ever been to an IKEA knows that it is not exactly a half-an-hour job, so who can blame their customers for putting their feet up for a minute or two?

However, on the other side of the world from the flat-pack giant’s native Sweden, testing the furniture is rarely the reason for a sofa break.

IKEA’s Beijing store regularly turns into a slumber party, with many customers visiting the store purposely for a nap, a catch-up with families or just to get a welcome break from the summer heat.

Welcome home: It is not unusual to see people napping, meeting up with friends or having a snack in the display 'rooms' in IKEA Beijing

Visiting IKEA without the need for a 
Billy bookcase or endless storage solutions, but simply to try the comfort of a Lervik frame or the bounce of a Malm may seem ludicrous to most people, 
but in China this is an ever-growing trend.

Many
people just come to the IKEA store to enjoy the air-conditioning on a 
hot summer day and to meet rest on the comfy furniture on display.

The company hasn't taken any measures against people making themselves at home, because it sees it as a future investment.

IKEA opened up their first shop in China in 1999 and the country is now home to three of the top-five largest IKEA's in the world, only beaten by one in - where else - Stockholm.

The flat-pack chain was founded by 87-year-old Ingvar Kamprad in 1943, celebrating its 70th anniversary this year.

IKEA
is the world’s largest furniture retailer, recording an annual net 
profit of £3.2billion in 2012, achieving sales of £27.6billion in 44 
countries.

There are more 
IKEA catalogues than bibles printed each year, and it is said that one 
in ten Europeans is now conceived in an IKEA bed.
