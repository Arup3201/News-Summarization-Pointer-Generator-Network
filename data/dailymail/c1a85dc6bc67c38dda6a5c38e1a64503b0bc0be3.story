A couple who faced the four devastating miscarriages have become parents for the first time... to quadruplets.

Grace Slattery, 31, gave birth to three girls and a boy on Monday morning, with husband James by her side.

Mr Slattery, already dubbed the 'Quad Father' by friends, faced a race against time to get to the hospital after his wife went into labour earlier than expected.

But thanks to the gardaí (the Irish police force), the father-of-four made it to his wife's side, after police officers gave him an escort from the couple's home in Limerick to the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin.

Mrs Slattery had been due to have a C-section on 
Tuesday, but shortly after midnight on Monday, she called her 
husband to say her waters had broken.

The father-of-four called his parents, who gave him a lift.

En route, Mrs Slattery suggested calling the gardai, who accompanied Mr Slattery to the hospital, giving him time to run to the operating theatre for the arrival of his daughters and son at 3.54am.

Born at 32 weeks and six days, the quads ranged in weight, from the biggest, Amelia Helen at 4lbs 3oz, to the smallest Mollie Rose weighing 2lbs 15oz.

The pair were born within minutes of each other, along with their brother Lucas James, weighing 3lbs 10oz and sister Lily Grace May, weighing 3lbs 4oz.

Mr Slattery told the Mirror: 'My parents picked me up, I got in the car and we headed to Dublin, and we rang to see what they (the gardai) could do for us and they literally gave us an escort all the way to the Rotunda, and I literally ran in the door and I just made it in time.

Mr Slattery was given a police escort from the couple's home in Limerick to the hospital in Dublin facing a race against time to make the birth of his four children Amelia, Mollie, Lucas and Lily. The couple conceived naturally after suffering four miscarriages in four years

'I didn't think it would happen at all. They were brilliant.'

Despite his frantic rush to the hospital, when Mr Slattery arrived, his wife was calmly preparing herself for the arrival of her quads.

The new arrivals were much longed for, with the couple facing four devastating miscarriages in the last four years.

Mr Slattery said they had their children naturally, despite rumours they might have had IVF treatment.

'Things haven't been great for the last four years, especially on Grace, things have been tough on her.

'We had made our minds up, that after the 
fourth (miscarriage) we wouldn't go again and then we changed our minds 
and we said we wanted to try once more, and it was natural.'
