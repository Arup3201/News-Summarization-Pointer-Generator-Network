Labour would guarantee patients an appointment with a family doctor within 48 hours - and within a day in urgent cases, Ed Miliband announced yesterday.

He called it a ‘scandal’ that many patients have to wait days to be seen by a GP, and said his party would plough hundreds of millions of pounds into cutting waiting times.

But doctors warned against a ‘knee jerk’ return to the 48 hour target, which was in force under the last Labour government, saying it would increase the burden on overstretched GPs.

Ed Miliband visited Leighton Hospital in Crewe today before announcing that under Labour voters would get a guarantee to see their GP within 48 hours

Mr Miliband claimed the £100million a year needed to fund shorter waiting times would be found by cutting back on NHS red tape and highly-paid consultants.

The number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80pc to 40pc under the Coalition, he said. One in four people have to wait a week to be seen.

The Labour leader said his ‘guarantee’ would prevent patients who cannot get an appointment with their GP flooding A&E departments and would save the NHS more than £300million.

‘This will be better for patients, because they have better access to their GP surgery; better for the NHS, because it will save money currently spent in A&E; and better for Britain, because it is the kind of health service we need’, he said.

The Conservatives called it an ‘unfunded pie in the sky policy’ and said they had scrapped the 48 hour target because doctors found it counter-productive to patient care.

Mr Miliband told an audience in Manchester that Labour would allow patients to speak to a doctor or triage nurse, rather than a receptionist on the phone straightaway. If their condition is judged to need immediate attention they can see a GP the same day.

All patients would have the right to see a GP at their own practice within 48 hours if they want to, although not necessarily the GP of their choice.

Ed Miliband has hit out at the Government's 'scandalous' NHS reforms, which he claims are costing millions of pounds. He wants to scrap the changes to fund more GP appointments

Chaand Nagpaul at the British Medical Association said last year when this policy as suggested that ‘arbitrary targets, even for limited periods, are unlikely to alleviate the pressures on the NHS and could make the situation worse.

He added: ‘It is likely to result in a rush for appointments when practices open which could overwhelm GP services and restrict the freedom of GPs to schedule appointments beyond 48 hours for patients with long-term conditions.’

Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, has also warned against a ‘knee jerk’ return to 48-hour targets, but welcomed the promise of extra funding to cut waiting times.

She said family doctors regularly see up to 60 patients a day, with the majority of GPs now saying that they fear missing something serious in a patient due to unsafe workloads.

‘GPs want to provide better access for their patients. We support the aspiration that patients should be able to book a GP appointment within 48 hours, as one of a range of options that also includes, for example, the ability to wait for longer to see a GP of their choice’, she said.

‘But the way to achieve this is not the imposition of top-down targets, but tackling the resourcing crisis that is at the root of the rising waiting times affecting general practice.’

She added: ‘While we welcome Mr Miliband’s announcement it must not be another ‘sticking plaster’ solution but part of a broader, long-term, shift in investment’.

Labour sources claimed the 48 hour guarantee would not be the same as the previous target, as patients who want to wait more than two days to see their own GP will still be able to.

GPs can spend the extra funding as they see fit, by hiring more staff or asking GPs to work longer hours.

The cost would be funded by cutting £78million of administration and legal fees associated with EU competition law, and reining in the £3million a month spending on consultants by three health quangos – Monitor, the Trust Development Authority and Commissioning Support Units.

Mr Miliband also told an audience of health workers that he would repeal the Health and Social Care Act– the law putting GPs back in charge of health budgets.

A Conservative Health Spokesman said: ‘This is an unfunded pie-in-the-sky policy that Labour can't pay for and doctors can't deliver. More unfunded spending would mean more borrowing and more taxes to pay for it.

‘The last Labour Government vandalised the relationship between GPs and their patients by introducing tick-box targets and scrapping family doctors, something we are now putting right.

‘Far from improving access, another top-down target will leave GPs less time with their patients and put more pressure on general practice.’
