Vince Cable taunted the Prime Minister yesterday by saying the Government’s failure to control immigration was a ‘good thing’.

The Tories were dealt a huge blow by new figures showing net migration to Britain had rocketed by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to September 2013.

It was driven entirely by a 40 per cent leap in the number of people taking advantage of EU edicts on free movement.

Tory immigration minister James Brokenshire insisted the government could not control immigration from within the EU, but Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said rising immigration was 'good news'

The
 shock increase left Downing Street unable to say if David Cameron would
 meet his key election promise to slash net migration to the ‘tens of 
thousands’ by 2015.

And his 
opponents on the Left and Right both declared his flagship policy in 
‘tatters’. But, in remarks apparently calculated to infuriate his 
coalition colleagues, Mr Cable declared the figures were a cause for 
celebration.

The Lib Dem 
Business Secretary said: ‘Actually, those figures are good news because 
the reason net immigration is going up is because fewer British people 
are emigrating and surely that’s a good thing – people are getting jobs 
here.

‘We are getting 
people coming in from Europe to fill jobs in our expanding labour 
market, but the key point is that nine out of every ten new jobs that 
are being created are going to British workers.

'This is further proof that any quota on migration, such as the one Conservatives are pushing to get net migration down to tens of thousands, is unworkable and contradicts our aims of getting Britain back on its feet.’

Prime Minister David Cameron promised to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands' but that aim is now a long way off

Running
 salt into Tory wounds, he added: ‘Any target on migration is totally 
impractical, cannot be delivered and would do great damage to the 
economy.’

Mr Cable has 
fought long-running battles with Tory ministers over immigration 
controls and is likely to view the figures as a personal victory. 
Hailing the rise as a success twists the knife into Mr Cameron, because 
Mr Cable knows that missing the cherished target will infuriate 
backbench Tory MPs and voters.

Ukip
 and Labour both said Mr Cameron’s pledge was nothing more than ‘smoke 
and mirrors’ since EU free movement rules rendered Britain powerless to 
stop workers flooding in from the continent.

There could be even worse news to follow later this year when more up-to-date figures are released.Yesterday’s statistics pre-date the controversial lifting of border controls on Romanians and Bulgarians on January 1.

Some 24,000 citizens of Romania and Bulgaria arrived in the year to 
September 2013 – nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived in the 
previous year.

Ministers 
tried to present the figures as an economic success story as migrants 
fled the turmoil in the eurozone for Britain’s stable jobs market.

While
 migrants from Poland continue to top the list, there was a leap in 
arrivals from Italy, Portugal and Spain, where youth unemployment is at 
record levels.

There was 
also a jump of 25 per cent in National Insurance numbers handed out to 
citizens of France, and the number  given to Germans increased by 10 per
 cent, to 11,500.

The Tories were dealt a huge blow by new figures showing net migration to Britain had rocketed by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to September 2013

Overall, 
532,000 people immigrated to the UK in the year ending September, up 
from the 497,000 people in the previous 12 months. Some 320,000 
emigrants left the country, down from the 343,000 the previous year.

But
 it was a surge in European Union citizens arriving in the UK that has 
driven the overall increase, rising to 209,000 from 149,000 the previous
 year, the Office for National Statistics said.

Some
 65,000 citizens of so-called EU15 countries, that is pre-2004 members 
of the union, arrived to work in the UK, an increase of 23,000 when 
compared to the previous year.

Immigration of non-EU citizens – who need a visa from the Home Office – fell to 244,000, down from 269,000 the previous year.

Statisticians
 said this was due to fewer New Commonwealth citizens – such as those 
from India – migrating to the UK for formal study.

Mark Hilton, of business group London First, said it was ‘game over’ for Mr Cameron’s migration target.

Ukip
 leader Nigel Farage said: ‘It is utterly pointless setting immigration 
targets when you can’t even decide who comes into this country.

‘Until
 we end the open-door immigration policy with the EU and take back full 
control over our borders, nothing can really be done. It’s all smoke and
 mirrors.’

Shadow Home 
Secretary Yvette Cooper added: ‘These figures show the Government’s net 
migration target is in tatters, and their immigration policy is a mess.’

Downing Street 
insisted the Government was ‘absolutely’ committed to its target to 
reduce net migration to tens of thousands by 2015.

But
 No 10 dodged questions about whether Mr Cameron was confident that 
would happen. His official spokesman said: ‘We are putting in place what
 we believe are the right measures that go towards meeting that 
objective.’

Immigration
 Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘Uncontrolled, mass immigration makes 
it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on our public 
services and forces down wages for people on low incomes.

‘Our
 reforms have cut non-EU migration to its lowest level since 1998 and 
there are now 82,000 fewer people arriving annually from outside the EU 
than when this government came to power.
