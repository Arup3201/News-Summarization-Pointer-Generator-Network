Probe: Ex-broker Patrick Coppeard from Essex, who is accused of fleecing fellow churchgoers

A church trustee and former magistrate is being investigated on suspicion of conning his fellow parishioners out of £6 million.

Patrick Coppeard, 48, a former broker at financial giant Merrill Lynch, voluntarily attended a police station.

The father of three was accompanied by the Rector of St John’s Church in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, where reality television star Jade Goody’s funeral was held in 2009.

As detectives questioned Mr Coppeard, the rector, the Rev Dr Ian Farley, began contacting about 40 parishioners from a list of 82 who are suspected of being duped out of large sums over four years.

‘There was an initial feeling of shock when I got the call,’ said one parishioner last night. ‘Now that emotion has turned to anger. It’s not about the money, it’s about being betrayed.’

The Serious Economic Crime Unit of Essex Police is examining claims some people lost up to £250,000 after allegedly being promised rapid returns on investments, including backing the expansion of a coffee chain in the US.

A text sent to a St John’s parishioner at 10.37pm on May 8, hours before police launched their probe, reads: ‘Just put the phone down to New York. There’s a great trade. One hundred per cent money back Tuesday but need rapid answer by 9am latest. Maximum £5k per head.’ 

The investor who received the text lost £37,000.

Other alleged victims include local pensioners who lost nest eggs and teenagers who handed over savings built up to cover university costs.

Wealthy backers at St John’s have organised a five-figure hardship fund to help those unable to meet immediate needs because of their losses.

One man, who had almost £100,000 invested at one stage, said police had told him only about 40 suspected victims had so far come forward from the list, with estimated losses totalling about £3 million.

‘If everyone involved gets in touch with police, you’re looking at up to £6 million, maybe more,’ he said.

Senior church figures are also suspected of having been defrauded. St John’s Treasurer Rob Smith said: ‘Reparation won’t be possible, I’ve been told.’

One parishioner said: ‘People were talking about the best way to deal with this, and about forgiveness, but it might take some of us a little longer to get round to that.’

Mr Coppeard, who resigned in February after more than ten years as a magistrate in East London, declined to comment yesterday at his £1 million home in Loughton.

‘If you have any questions, you should direct them to the police,’ he said as the family prepared for his daughter Charlotte’s church wedding, which was held away from St John’s.

He has been released on police bail until October.
