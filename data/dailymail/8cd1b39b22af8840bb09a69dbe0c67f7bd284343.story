A suspected case of mistaken identity has left a 32-year-old man dead during a night-time romantic encounter in a Northeast Philadelphia apartment this week.

Marc Carrion was shot in the head inside a unit at the Holme Circle Apartments Monday night after police say the man who lived there found the victim hiding in his daughter's bedroom.

Carrion was rushed to Aria Health Torresdale Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries early Tuesday morning.

'Lover': Those who knew Carrion said he had been romantically involved with Brenda Jordan, 20 (pictured), and she likely invited him to her room 

Investigators believe Charles Jordan, 41, opened fire on Carrion because he took him for an intruder, but those who knew the 32-year-old claim the man had been invited into the house by Jordan's 20-year-old daughter, reported the Philadelphia Daily News. 

The 41-year-old shooter has been cooperative with the investigation, surrendering his licensed gun and submitting himself to questioning by police.

So far, no charges have been filed in the deadly shooting.

The incident took place at around 11.30pm Monday when police officers received a 911 call from the Holme Circle housing complex on Axe Factory Road about shots fired.

Responding officers entered Charles Jordan’s second-floor apartment and found Marc Carrion lying inside with a single gunshot wound to the head.

Charles Jordan told officers that he came into his daughter Brenda’s room and found the 32-year-old stranger crouching in the corner.

A struggle ensued and Jordan shot Carrion from a revolver.

Crime scene: The shooting took place inside the Jordans' apartment at the Holme Circle housing complex  

Investigators working to piece together what happened inside Jordan's home Monday night have uncovered evidence to suggest that Brenda Jordan was dating Carrion and had invited him into her room.

A neighbor told the paper that he heard a gunshot in the night followed by a woman's scream, 'No, Daddy, No!'

The woman, presumed to be Ms Jordan, was then overhead saying: 'Why did you do that? He was my best friend.'

Marc Carrion's mother, Gloria Moyett, told the paper Charles Jordan’s story about an intruder does not make sense to her, nor does his violent reaction.

Romance: Jordan and Carrion had met only recently, and on the night of the killing a neighbor overheard the 20-year-old tell her father that the victim was her 'best friend'

‘He's with your daughter, she's not screaming, and you shoot him just because you don't know him?’ she said.

Moyett said her 32-year-old son a troubled past, including a drug arrest in 2008, but he had been working hard to rebuild his life.

Carrion and Brenda Jordan had met only recently. Her Facebook page lists him as a friend. 

Carrion is survived by three young children from a previous relationship.
