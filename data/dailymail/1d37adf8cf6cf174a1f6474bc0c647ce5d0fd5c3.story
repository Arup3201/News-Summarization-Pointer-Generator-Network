A Tampa girl who lost both legs in a horrific accident in April is close to her dream of being a ballerina after having new prosthetic limbs fitted.

It is the second set of legs three-year-old Ireland Nugent has received, after a growth spurt meant she could only use the first pair for a few weeks.

The toddler lost her legs below the ankles after her father accidentally ran her over on a ride-on lawnmower.

While it has been a traumatic year for Ireland's family, the little girl seems unfazed by all the hospital appointments and changes in her life. 

'It's a new toy for her. She doesn't realize how important it is,' her mother Nicole told Click Orlando after Ireland's latest fitting.

Ireland will have to return to Orlando Prosthetics Associates every three to four months until she stops growing, but the accident has failed to stop the ambitious toddler.

On a support Facebook page, set up to help raise funds for Ireland's medical bills, the toddler has been pictured playing on a trampoline and learning to walk again.

Her mother has also talked of Ireland's excitement at being able to start ballet lessons.

In a Facebook post she said: 'Guess who will be going to register for ballet when we get legs?! US! I know she'll do great, and look beautiful in her new legs and tutu!'

Mrs Nugent added that her cheery daughter loves to dance, telling her mother to hold her up so she can twirl.

Her bright attitude is helping the family come to terms with the freak accident and long road to recovery.

'We take it day by day and as long as she's happy were happy,' Mrs Nugent said.

Her daughter recently celebrated her third birthday, with a princess themed party. 'It's just not her birthday to us, it's just a celebration of being here,' Mrs Nugent told the Tampa Bay Times.

A few days after the party last month Ireland had another surgery so doctors could shave down a portion of her right leg.

Such a surgery may become a regular occurrence while Ireland is still growing.

Ireland lost her legs on April 11 when her father Jerry rode a lawn mower up the driveway at their Palm Harbor home.

Her mother had frantically motioned for him to stop, but he misunderstood, put the lawn mower in reverse and backed over the child.

The toddler's legs were severed below the knees and she had cuts to her hand. She also broke her thumb.

Experts were worried that the little girl might refuse to walk with her new prosthetic limbs, but the Tampa Bay Times reported that the girl has already become emotionally attached to the legs.

Community effort: Supporters have raised $150,000 so far to help pay for her medical expenses

When the prosthetist said he would need the test limbs back during a June fitting, the little girl said she wanted to keep them.

The shocking case garnered national attention and photos of Ireland's bright smile warmed the hearts of thousands who followed her progress.

All told, $150,000 has been donated to the family through their support website in order to help pay for her medical bills.

'She will continue to succeed. She will do great things in her life,' Mrs Nugent said. 'This will not stop Ireland.'

When she took her first post-operation steps in June, her father was brimming with pride after initial fears that she may reject the prosthetics.

'She took it over the top ... She's not ever going to hold back,' he said. 'That's my superhero. That's my angel.'
