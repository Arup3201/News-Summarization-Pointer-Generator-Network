Move over blondes, the most beautiful women are brunettes.

A new survey has asked who the 50 greatest beauty icons of the  last 50 years are, with Audrey Hepburn coming out on top.

Overall, 33 out of the 50 were brunettes, 17 blondes and just one redhead - 1940s film legend Rita Hayworth.

Icon: Audrey Hepburn, pictured here, was voted the most desirable woman of the last 50 years

Royally beautiful: The Duchess of Cambridge's long brown hair is the envy of many women the world over

The top 10 women in the survey, which was carried out by Superdrug, Audrey Hepburn was directly followed by three blonde icons: Princess Diana of Wales, Grace Kelly and Brigitte Bardot.

But supermodel Twiggy was the only other blonde in the top 10, which featured a total of six brunettes.

Elizabeth Taylor, the Duchess of Cambridge, Angelina Jolie, Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai and actress Catherine Zeta-Jones all featured, as reported in The Sun today.

Also in the list of desirable brunettes were Kelly Brook, Mila Kunis, Jackie Kennedy, Victoria Beckham and Alexa Chung.

In the blonde corner, 17 per cent of those who voted went to Princess Diana.

Kate Moss, Holly Willoughby, Charlize Theron and Scarlett Johannson all made the list, too.

X Factor judge Cheryl Cole had twice as many votes as Nicole Scherzinger, who also sat on the X Factor panel.

Superdrug spokesperson Simon Comins told The Sun: 'The public like to look at all the attributes that make an amazing woman.'

Always an icon: Princess Diana was voted the second most beautiful woman of the last 50 years. She followed Audrey Hepburn, making her the most desirable of all the blondes on the list

Red on top: Rita Hayworth was actually naturally brunette, but died her hair to attract a greater range of roles

Rita Hayworth, who was born Margarita Carmen Cansino
 in 1918, was the only redhead in the votes.

She was, in fact, a natural brunette, but dyed her hair red as she thought it would get her more film roles.

It clearly worked, as the actress and dancer rose to international fame in the 1940s and 1950s as one of 
Hollywood's sexiest and most iconic 'femme fatales'.

An icon of early cinema, she was one of the few women who danced on screen with both Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.

She died of Alzheimer's disease in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan in May 1987 when she was 68 years old.

Breakfast at Tiffanys and Funny Face actress Audrey Hepburn was 63 when she died.

Like Rita, she was considered one of the greatest beauties and most iconic actresses of all time.
