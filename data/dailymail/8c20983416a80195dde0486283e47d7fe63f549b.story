The BBC’s former director general and two of his key lieutenants personally apologised for wasting £100million on a failed IT project yesterday.

In a grovelling appearance before the Commons public accounts committee, Mark Thompson said sorry to MPs and taxpayers for the Digital Media Initiative (DMI) fiasco ‘that meant the loss of a lot of public money.’

He said: ‘I just want to say sorry. I want to apologise to you and to the public for the failure of this project.’

Mark Thompson, former director general of the BBC, apologised for the failure of the DMI project while being grilled by MPs

Mr Thompson was joined by his former finance chief Zarin Patel and the 
head of the BBC Trust’s finance committee Anthony Fry, both of whom took
 responsibility for their part in the debacle.

But the triple apology
 was marred by the unrepentant stance of former BBC chief operating 
officer Caroline Thomson, who was put in charge of DMI in April 2011.Not
 only did she fail to apologise for wasting the money, she also refused 
to hand back a £680,000 severance payoff she was handed in 2012 – and 
boasted the huge windfall had enabled her to pursue her dreams as a 
ballet director.

The closest Miss Thomson came to admitting 
responsibility was when she said she ‘could have made a misjudgment’ by 
failing to spot DMI was struggling in 2011, although she did not accept 
this was definitely the case.

Refusing to hand back her severance 
money, she said she could ‘understand’ those who felt it was excessive, 
but insisted: ‘I did a very big and responsible job. I could have earned
 a lot more if I had been working for ITV or in the commercial sector.’ 

Damning: The BBC was accused not having a grip on the huge project which ran into trouble, costing £98million

When
 the Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was launched in 2008, it was hailed 
by BBC chiefs as 'the single most important initiative we are working 
on'.

But before a year had 
elapsed, it was floundering so badly insiders referred to it as 'Don't 
Mention It.' The BBC originally appointed IT firm Siemens to implement 
the scheme. But it ditched the company in 2009 as the project floundered
 and took it back in house.

By then, £26million had already been wasted but it is understood the BBC later recouped the cost from Siemens.

In
 February 2011, the National Audit Office condemned the corporation over
 its handling of the DMI after it ran 21 months behind schedule.

The
 public spending watchdog found the expected gains had been overstated 
and the difficulty of delivering it was underestimated.

The Public Accounts Committee criticised the BBC for awarding the contract to Siemens without putting it out to open tender.

The
 project was meant to allow production staff to access all video and 
audio material - for example last year's Olympics coverage - on their 
computers.

As hundreds of 
staff moved to the corporation's new headquarters in Salford, this would
 prevent them having to transport tapes of archive material by road from
 London, reducing production costs.

But the costs of the project continued to spiral to £98.4million until it was finally halted in May.

Asked why she had not in fact moved to ITV but instead became chief 
executive of English National Ballet, Miss Thomson boasted: ‘Thanks to 
the payoff and the size of it I don’t need to earn as much money as I 
used to.’

At the end of an occasionally acrimonious hearing – in 
which it emerged the BBC is still spending £3million a year on DMI – 
committee chairman Margaret Hodge, said the failure was ‘almost beyond 
parody’.

She added: ‘I’ve got to say, I hope to goodness this is the 
last hearing we have on a saga of this nature in relation to the BBC.

'I 
think there was a jungle of bureaucracy around at that time. Rather 
sadly there were also some half-truths floating around the place. I 
think the BBC does deserve better.’

Launched in 2008, the DMI – 
jokingly referred to among staff as ‘Don’t Mention It’ – was intended to
 digitise archives, enabling staff to share and download material 
remotely instead of using tapes.

It was scrapped last May by present 
director general Tony Hall. But it has taken until now  for those in 
charge at the time to admit responsibility.

Mr Thompson – who became 
chief executive of the New York Times after he left the BBC in 2012 – 
denied misleading MPs when he told a hearing three years ago that DMI 
was working well.

Miss Patel – who earned £337,000 a year as the 
BBC’s chief financial officer until last year – also apologised for 
failing to call a halt to the project earlier.

She said: ‘I took false 
optimism from my ability to correct things in the programme, and for 
that I apologise.’ Mr Fry admitted the failure was ‘significantly 
embarrassing’.
