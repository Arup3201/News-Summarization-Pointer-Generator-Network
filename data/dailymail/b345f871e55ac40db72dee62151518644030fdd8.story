Baby Gammy, the baby at the centre of the Thai surrogacy scandal, has celebrated his first day as an Australian citizen.

In 2014, Gammy's surrogate mother, Pattamaron Chanbua, applied for citizenship along with her son, as a way to safeguard his future.

Australian charity Hands Across the Water aided the process, previously securing a house for Gammy and his family.

Gammy first made headlines when Ms Chanbua claimed that West Australian couple Wendy and David Farnell had abandoned him in Thailand, after discovering he had Down Syndrome.

The Farnells returned to Australia with Gammy's twin sister Pipah, while Ms Chanbua remained with Gammy in Thailand's Chonburi province. 

Mr Farnell, a convicted child sex offender, retained custody of Pipah late last year after an investigation by the WA Department for Child Protection.

In November, WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said there would be 'continual and rigorous testing' of a safety plan that had been developed for Pipah. 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection confirmed on Tuesday that Gammy's application for citizenship by descent had been granted.

Ms Chanbua said that despite the official decision, she had no immediate plans to take her son to Australia.'

'I want him to be near me here so that I don't have to miss him,' Ms Chanbua, 21, said. 

'But if all of my family, including me die and if Gammy is left behind alone, at least the Australian government will help him,' she said.

Ms Chanbua confirmed that Gammy was in good health and had celebrated his first birthday in December. 

They live in a comfortable house paid for using part of the $250,000 raised for the family through public donations, which has new furniture, a television set, and plenty of kids' toys.

And apart from a few minor hospital visits the family lives a normal life, even going on trips to the beach together.

Peter Baines, founder of the charity handling Gammy's medical and living expenses, said the family had been doing well since moving into their new home in October.

'Gammy's had some health issues and that's not to be unexpected, but they're certainly in a better space then they would have been,' said Mr Baines, of Hands Across The Water.

'He had a repeat of a lung infection and spent a few days in hospital.

'Nothing as severe as what it was the first time and certainly it was treated a lot quicker and recovery was a lot better than what it was.'

Mr Baines added that Gammy loved playing with his siblings.

'He's just a healthy, happy boy who loves interacting with his brother and he's got a beautiful personality about him,' he said.

'It's not right he be defined by health issues, or what happened to him, or the fact that he's got Down syndrome.

Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of Gammy's twin sister Pipah, pictured with David and Wendy Farnell

Almost half of the $250,00 raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, where the pair will live with Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children, 100km south of Bangkok
