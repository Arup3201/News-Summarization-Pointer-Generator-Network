The father of murdered bride Anni Dewani has today marked what would have been his daughter's 33rd birthday in a hospital bed after his arm was torn off in a freak accident.

Engineer Vinod Hindocha, 65, was fixing a lift when it plunged to the ground, ripping his right arm off. 

He underwent a 13-hour operation to reattach his limb after being airlifted to hospital in Gothenberg, Sweden.

Today, Mr Hindocha posted a picture on Facebook of himself with two nurses and wife his Nilam, a cake and treats to mark Anni's birthday. She was 27 when she was shot dead on her honeymoon in South Africa.

He wrote: ‘Happy Birthday little Angel. Miss U for ever. We R celebrating this Birthday In Gothinburg  hospital,love U for EVER’

Mr Hindocha was carrying out repairs on March 3 in Sweden when a chain slipped, sending the lift cage he was standing in hurtling to the ground floor.

However, his arm was extended outside the cage at the time, meaning it was ripped off just below the shoulder. Mr Hindocha recalls seeing the limb suspended one storey above him after he fell. 

His brother Ashok, 54, told MailOnline that Mr Hindocha had recovered some movement in his fingers, but will not make a full recovery for at least 18 months, if ever.

He added: 'He’s such a good person, he’s been through so much. Bad things happen to good people sometimes.

'Nilam and Vinod have had a very difficult few months. 

'They are such a strong couple, they will get through this aswell. But it is a lot for anyone to go through. 

'We are grateful that he was in Sweden and could get to hospital so quickly and into surgery to try and save the arm. Only time will tell whether the operation will be successful. 

'Today is Anni's birthday and that fills the minds and hearts of all the family.'

Mr Hindocha's wife Nilam, 64, who is in remission from stomach cancer, was with him in Sweden at the time of the accident and had gone shopping when he was hurt. 

The horrific accident comes after a harrowing court case attended by Mr Hindocha in which details of his daughter's murder were recounted in detail. 

Anni was killed on November 13 2010 while riding in a cab with her new husband, Shrien Dewani, 35, through the impoverished township of Gugulethu, Cape Town.

The cab was hijacked by two gunmen who threw Shrien out before driving away. The vehicle was discovered the next day with Anni's body in the back seat. She had been shot in the neck.

Shortly afterwards taxi driver Zola Tongo, 35, was arrested. He confessed to his part in the death, naming Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe as the men who carried out the fatal attack.

The tragedy came after Mr Hindocha saw Shrien Dewani, the husband of his murdered daughter Anni, acquitted of ordering her killing (pictured, Shrien and Anni together before they wed)

However, he also said Shrien had ordered him to carry out a hit on his new bride, claiming he wanted out of the marriage.

After years of delays and legal wrangling during which Shrien claimed to be suffering from depression, he was finally extradited to South Africa to stand trial last year.

During the short case, the judge heard that Shrien had been bisexual and had visited gay porn websites and chat rooms exploring his homosexual fantasies.

The trial also heard testimony from several key witnesses, though one of the men serving time in jail for killing Anni, Xolile Mngeni, died of a brain tumour before he could give evidence.

Eventually the judge threw the case out, telling prosecutors their argument was riddled with contradictions. 

Anni's family said they had been failed by the justice system and condemned the acquittal.
