Perhaps all India’s batsmen should have spent their first practice day studying policing skills instead of preparing for the final Test. It certainly did not appear to do their captain any harm as MS Dhoni stood firm against England.

Dhoni can appear a detached, uninterested figure when things are going badly for his side, as in the last two Tests, but there was no doubting his commitment to the Indian cause while all around him collapsed at the Kia Oval.

If it were not for Dhoni, who spent Wednesday at a police training centre in Kent rather than training at the Oval, India would already be all but beaten, with England’s recovery from a 1-0 deficit to a 3-1 series triumph near complete.

As it is, despite the India captain bristling defiance while scoring 82 of his side’s 148 all out, England are very much in control of the fifth Investec Test, Alastair Cook and Sam Robson reducing the deficit by 62 by the close.

This was the bowling performance England badly wanted after naming an unchanged side, with Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes vindicating the faith placed in them by playing a full role in support of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.

Between them England’s attack were far too hot for a deflated India to handle on a greener than usual Oval pitch and with conditions very much in the bowlers' favour after Alastair Cook had won an important toss.

Even though England took nine wickets in that last session at Old Trafford to hurry India to defeat they were disappointed Jordan and Woakes could not fully grab the chance presented to them by injury to Broad and illness to Anderson.

They could have easily decided the time was right for the re-introduction of Steven Finn or the return of Ben Stokes but instead were conscious of the need to provide proper opportunities for emerging players to establish themselves.

Jordan in particular seemed to benefit from a longer run than his first in Test cricket, which ended abruptly after two Tests against Sri Lanka, as he looked much more like the man who made such an impression in one day cricket.

It was here in south London this time last year that Woakes made an unexpected debut in the last Test against Australia and the jury has been well and truly out on him during three Tests where he had taken just two wickets.

This, however, was much more like it, the frailties of an Indian batting line-up who seem to think their job was done after they took the lead at Lord’s helping Jordan and Woakes to six wickets between them as England made hay.

With Anderson taking two of the eight wickets he needed to overtake Sir Ian Botham and become England’s leading wicket-taker and Stuart Broad proving his fitness with two victims of his own Cook was very much in control.

India assisted the England captain, too. It is difficult to over-estimate the transformation in this series since England collapsed in a heap on the last day of the second Test and Cook’s captaincy appeared to be hanging by a thread.

MS Dhoni’s side had a wonderful chance to make history in winning a five-Test series in England but they have fallen apart ever since while losing focus over their obsession with the spat between Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja.

England were excellent on Friday but India were woeful, no-one other than Dhoni, and his partner in a last-wicket partnership of 58 in Ishant Sharma, showing any sort of application or stomach for the fight.

The tone was set when Anderson removed Gautam Gambhir, trying to leave a brute of a delivery, with the fourth ball of the match and it was reinforced when Broad removed another brick in the wall that was Cheteshwar Pujara.

Enter Jordan who continued where he left off at Old Trafford, where he ended the Test with two wickets in successive balls, with two wicket maidens here to remove both Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane. At which time, across the two Tests, Jordan had taken four wickets without conceding a run in 14 balls.

And so it continued until Ishant, badly missed by India in the last two Tests, joined his captain and held England up in yet another productive last-wicket stand, even though India should never have reached three figures.

There was a suspicion Dhoni had edged one early in his innings that England failed to appeal for while Ian Bell spoilt an otherwise perfect day for the new-look slip cordon by spilling Ishant off Jordan when India were on just 95.

Yet it was only a mild irritation for an England side who maintained the initiative they first claimed in Southampton and maintained in Manchester under a captain in Cook who has come through such a searching examination.

Cook’s luck changed when he was dropped on 15 by Jadeja before going on to 95 in Southampton and he received another slice here on nine when England replied as Paul Reiffel turned down an lbw appeal from Bhuvneshwar Kumar that Hawk-Eye suggested was plumb.

The England captain lived to fight another day and if his side bat all day on Saturday then they really will be almost home and hosed.
