Fernando Torres is trying to make a permanent move to AC Milan with the Spain striker's representatives in talks with Chelsea over severance pay.

The £50million Chelsea flop's agent held talks with the Serie A giants on Thursday morning over Torres filling the gap left by Mario Balotelli, now at Liverpool.

Torres has two years left on his £150,000-a-week deal at Stamford Bridge, but wants a lump sum in order to leave the club.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho wants to offload Torres in order to bring in another attacker before Monday's transfer deadline.

Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani confirmed his club was in talks over Torres on Tuesday.

He said: 'Our goal is to take a great striker. Fernando Torres? He is a great striker. Let’s see if he comes or someone else. We are actively working.'

The Italian side also wanted to recruit Dutch star Marco van Ginkel from Chelsea on a season-long loan deal, but the midfielder has opted to stay in west London.
