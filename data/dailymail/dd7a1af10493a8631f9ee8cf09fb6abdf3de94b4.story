'Hi, baby,' Catherine La France cooed as she swept granddaughter Arianna into her arms and danced around the California Folsom prison yard with the 3-year-old.

She pulled her two daughters into a bear hug, and the girls burst into tears. La France hadn't seen Arianna's mother, 18-year-old Samantha La France, in six months, and she last saw Summer La France, 14, nearly three years ago.

They soon dropped into easy banter as barbed concertina wire high above them glinted in the sun and guards armed with pepper spray discreetly patrolled nearby.

'This is my birthday present and 
Mother's Day at the same time,' Catherine La France said at the stark, 
concrete-block-walled prison for low-risk offenders where she's been 
locked up for nearly two years. La France turned 39 two days earlier and
 won't be released for three more years, when she completes a sentence 
for petty theft.

Three 
generations of La France women got 4 Â½ precious hours together at Folsom
 Women's Facility east of Sacramento more than a week before Mother's 
Day, which is Sunday.

It happened through a free, nonprofit program 
called Get on the Bus that arranges for children to visit their 
incarcerated parents in California prisons around Mother's and Father's 
days.

Get on the Bus appears
 to be unique in providing free transportation to children around the 
two holidays and in offering counseling and other support, said Ann 
Adalist-Estrin, director of the National Resource Center on Children and
 Families of the Incarcerated at Rutgers University, Camden.

A handful 
of programs in other states, including Florida and New York, provide 
transportation to kids as part of a larger mission to help prisoners and
 their families.

'We have 
kids every year that are meeting their moms or dads for the first time,'
 California program organizer Hilary Carson said, while others have not 
seen their parent in years.

The organization's survey of participants, 
who average 8 years old, shows that more than half wouldn't otherwise be
 able to see their imprisoned parent without the program.

On Saturday, 40 minors and four 
young-adult children of inmates made the trip to Folsom Women's 
Facility. Tears of joy streamed down mothers' smiling faces as their 
kids arrived, and lingering, emotional embraces came before the bus 
pulled away. The trip began before dawn in San Jose, and the bus made 
stops to pick up children along the way.

It's
 the second Mother's Day the bus chartered by the nonprofit Center for 
Restorative Justice Works visited the prison designed to house 400 
low-risk women. But this year there were about half as many children, 
Carson said. Not enough participants from Southern California signed up 
to justify chartering a second bus.

Similar
 buses fan out to 10 of the state's 34 adult prisons each year. On 
Friday, more than 250 children plan to visit two prisons in central 
California.

At Folsom 
Women's Facility, Erica Carmona, 21, tirelessly chased her 3-year-old 
son the entire visit, grinning as he kicked a soccer ball around the 
yard or tugged her along with a jump rope. Other children played 
pingpong on two concrete tables, had their faces painted and played 
pickup games with footballs and basketballs.

'I was worried he would forget who I was,' said Carmona, who is serving a sentence for assault with a deadly weapon.

When the youngsters boarded the bus for the ride home, they each received a teddy bear and a letter written by Mom.

With
 their time together running out, Lisa Mercuri, 33, sat quietly blowing 
soap bubbles with her 4-year-old son, Noah, on a bench bolted to the 
prison wall. His face was painted like a pirate, with an eye patch, 
roguish handlebar mustache and goatee.

'Let's get your car and go,' he said suddenly, tugging at her. 'Get your car. Let's go.'

The car is long gone, and Mercuri won't be going anywhere until January, when she completes her sentence for forgery and fraud.

'How do you explain that to a 4-year-old?' she wondered aloud.'I just tell him I'm on a big-girl timeout.
