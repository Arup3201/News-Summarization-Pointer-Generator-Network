TACKLE KEOWN SPECIAL: What it was like to be Invincible 

When Arsenal were Invincible - a recollection of an unbeatable team 

It's 10 years since Arsenal's spectacular unbeaten 49 matches  in the Premier League came to a close and when Graham Poll, who was at the top of his game for over 25 years, took charge of high profile fixtures across the globe.

Having seen many of the world's finest players in action, former referee Graham Poll was lucky enough to officiate during the era when Arsene Wenger guided the Arsenal 'Invincibles'. Here's his take on members of that record breaking run...

Graham Poll referees a fiesty clash between Arsenal and Manchester United during the 'Invincibles' era

Having refereed six of 'The Invincibles' 49-match unbeaten run, including the last one they won, I got to know how close the team worked and it was that incredible team spirit and total belief in one another that enabled their fine run.  

Poll, having a word with keeper Jens Lehmann, knew the opposition would play on the German's temperament

JENS LEHMANN

Whenever you refereed Arsenal against Bolton you knew it would be a battle. Sam Allardyce played on the big German's fragile temperament and put Kevin Nolan on him, literally, at set pieces.

In December 2003 I was aware of the ill feeling between the two sides when Nolan kept chipping away at me telling me that I shouldn't give Arsenal anything as he knew they didn't like me. 

Fortunately I ignored his advice when pulling him up for treading on Lehmann's toes at a corner. Penalising that kept Lehmann in the right mood.

Defender Sol Campbell, celebrating a goal for the Gunners, made Poll doubt his own decision during a match

SOL CAMPBELL

Campbell was a very level headed footballer who said very little to me or any referees. I must have really tested this when giving a penalty against him for a foul on Alan Shearer late into a game Arsenal were already losing 2-1.

Campbell just looked at me astonished and shook his head. That had more effect on me than him screaming in my face. I knew I'd got the decision wrong.

Left back Ashley Cole was an integral part of Arsenal's rock solid defence but was never short of a word

ASHLEY COLE 

Cole was perhaps the opposite of Campbell; never slow to tell you how you'd made a mistake or how bad you were. His comments were usually laced with abuse but issued in such a way that left you wondering if he meant to offend or was just not very bright.

Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp, celebrating for the Gunners, was a pain to referee says Poll

DENNIS BERGKAMP 

An absolute genius on the ball but the Dutchman could be a real pain for referees. A couple of seasons earlier I remember calling then skipper Tony Adams to me and asking him to help me shut Bergkamp up. 'Just book him, we think he's a pain as well,' Adams advised me with a smile.

Robert Pires, who scored four times in Poll's six 'Invincibles' games, asked the referee to call him Bobby

ROBERT PIRES 

A French gentleman who was polite, calm and friendly to deal with, telling me to 'Call me Bobby'. Pires scored four times in those six games, the goal at the Reebok was an absolute cracker.

It was the French connection, with Arsene Wenger's influence, which led to an embarrassing incident for me. In Cesc Fabregas' first season he was down injured and I approached him to ask, 'Ca va?' Fabregas replied, 'I'm fine and SPANISH!'

Poll says Gilberto Silva was a gifted player but was left frustrated when he missed a penalty at Old Trafford

GILBERTO SILVA 

Another gifted player who was never in the face of referees but disappointed me in one game when he failed to convert a penalty at Old Trafford. Referees are accused of not giving penalties to away teams at Manchester United so when we do you could at least score.

Highly influential winger Freddie Ljungberg knew exactly how to wind up the opposition, according to Poll

FREDDIE LJUNGBERG 

Another gifted wide player who had the ability to get under the skin of opponents by winding them up. I remember sending Mikael Silvestre off when playing for Manchester United at Highbury after being tormented by Ljungberg time and again, he resorted to butting the Swede.

Alex Ferguson was livid and as Silvestre approached him leaving the field demanded to know what he was supposed to have done. 'Sorry boss, he p***** me off so I nutted him' came the honest appraisal. Ljungberg's job was done.

Arsenal legend Thierry Henry (right) was the best centre forward to play in the Premier League says Poll

THIERRY HENRY 

The best centre forward ever to play in the Premier League, perhaps down to his speed of thought as much as his pace over the turf. I remember allowing the Frenchman to take a quick free-kick against Chelsea which went straight into the unguarded corner of the net – he saw the opportunity and asked permission which I gave him. 

Two years later I made him wait for the wall to go back at Wigan and after I blew my whistle he just lifted the all up and over the wall and bent it into the top left corner for a wonderful goal. Nothing seemed beyond him except recognising referees! 

After one defeat at Highbury, Henry went absolutely ballistic trying to get to me to blame me for the defeat. 'You cost us in the Cup final and now tonight it's enough!' Unfortunately I never refereed Arsenal in a Cup final so clearly players are guilty of mistaken identity as well as referees.

Former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira was part of the tunnel clash with Roy Keane, which Poll oversaw

PATRICK VIEIRA 

The hard man of the team but a real Jekyll and Hyde character; tough as nails on the pitch, considered and polite off it. There was of course the infamous tunnel clash with Roy Keane which I oversaw which stands out but by then we had established a mutually respectful relationship. 

Building that was difficult as Vieira's combative tackling was always going to cause issues with referees and I sent him off twice, both for second yellow cards. Some players adjusted their style when on a yellow but not Vieira. He knew one way and that was uncompromising and hard.

Two off field incidents spring to mind; the day after the tunnel incident I bumped into Vieira in the British Airways lounge at Heathrow. We chatted for a few minutes about the previous evening's game and Vieira said he felt they lost the game by winding-up United and Keane in particular.

I then refereed Vieira in a Champions League game in Turin when he was at Juventus and he took the time and trouble to pop into my dressing room after the game to thank us and tell us how much he missed English refereeing – interesting given his style of play.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, still at the helm in north London, won his third Premier League title in 2004

ARSENE WENGER 

Tactically superb but temperamental. Wenger often used the tactic of planting a seed of doubt in a referee's mind at half-time when throwing a comment at you in the tunnel about what you were failing to see. Hard as you would try you found yourself looking for that early in the second-half so the tactic worked.

My most stark memory was after a League Cup semi-final defeat in which I cautioned lots and dismissed Vieira, Wenger made it clear how disappointed he was with my officiating.

I offered to visit him at the training ground and go through the DVD with him and the team to help them see why I had done what I had. He declined saying that he didn't want his team to change their approach by considering a referee's decisions. His conviction was absolute and his belief unwavering then as it is now – hence why he has seen so many red cards for his players.
