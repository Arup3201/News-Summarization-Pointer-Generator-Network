A photographer has documented the struggles of California women who give birth while in jail and others who are bringing up their children in prison.

Photojournalist Mae Ryan captured the images of women at facilities in Chino and Pomona who were among the estimated four per cent of state and three per cent of federal inmates that are pregnant. 

Her photos expose the complicated lives of many inmates who are separated from their children after only hours together or others trying to be good mothers while behind bars.

Ms Ryan's work explores two centers in California, where 200 mothers gave birth while incarcerated in the state between 2011 and 2012.

The pregnant women the photographer met in 2013 are given pre-natal care by a resident gynaecologist before their births.

They are then taken to local hospitals for their births, which cost the state between $6,500 to $14,000 per birth, according to Feature Shoot.

However, the time after giving birth can be harrowing for the mothers.

Women, waiting for photos or news of newborns that they gave to relatives, develop post-partum depression. 

Others struggle with physical pain of pregnancy while watching their children given to foster care.

Christina Bray already had three children when she went into labor while being arrested for embezzling money from a banking client. 

She said through tears that she held her daughter Lola Mae close to her heart before having to let her go, according to KPCC.

Women who deliver while incarcerated are given between 24 and 48 hours with their newborns.

'There's really no after care here. They just handed me a Kotex pad and said have a good day,' inmate Britney Bass, in prison because of a parole violation, said two weeks after giving birth. 

She said she was happy to finally be able to sit down without pain after being whisked back to the prison 48 hours after she delivered her baby and handed it over for adoption.

The resident gynaecologist at the California Institute for Women, a state prison in Chino, said that many pregnant women come off the street and have not received any treatment before going to prison.

Corazon Navarro said that the prison cannot afford to give inmates exceptional quality of care, but said that she tries to do the best she can.

But pregnancy in prison often presents issues not thought about by those on the outside.

Inmates getting ready to give births face worries beyond those normal for first-time mothers. 

Regina Zodiacal, who was five months pregnant when she was arrested for shoplifting and forgery, told Ms Ryan that they worried about going into labor while in their cells and wardens will not hear them, leaving them alone for the ordeal.

Advocates for the rights of expectant women in California prisons also won a victory in 2012  when the state legislature passed a law prohibiting women from being shackled during their pregnancies.

While many women give their children to relatives to take care of, some prisoners have the opportunity to live with their children in special facilities such as the Community Prisoner Mother Program in Pomona.

The 24-bed facility only allows a select group of incarcerated mothers and has no armed guards and no barbed wires.

It does, however, have a kindergarten.

Inmates with children under six are allowed to live with their kids while developing 'skills necessary to become a functioning, self-sufficient family that positively contributes to society' according to the California Department of Corrections.

An estimated 250,000 children are separated from their mothers because of incarceration, according to AETN. 

The Pomona center is designed to keep mothers and children together while the prisoners learn skills to help them reintegrate into society

Inmates are allowed to take their children to the playground or away from the facility for doctor appointments

Only 46 per cent of mothers in prison reported having a personal visit from their children since being incarcerated. 

However, inmates at the Mother Program are allowed to take their kids to a playground at the facility or even leave for doctor appointments.

The women are required to do chores as they would in prison, but they are also able to read their children bedtime stories.

Though children are thought to do better when not separated from their mothers, the environment is not often 'child friendly' and can seem more like a medical clinic than a home, according to a study from Legal Services for Women with Children.

The advocacy group has pushed for better food and medical conditions at the facilities.

Despite problems, the mothers said they wouldn't want their children anywhere else.

Mrs Bray was eventually able to be reunited with Lola Mae after 13 months apart after she was accepted to the Pomona program. 

'There is no home without a mother,' she said, adding that prisoners deserve second chances. 

Luckily for women at the facility, the situation is often temporary.

Woman accepted to the program must be sentenced to 36 months or less.

The same women accepted to the nursery program are often good candidates for being transferred to community supervision rather than prison.
