America's second richest man has shown his support for abortion by donating more than $1.2 billion to pro-choice groups in the last decade, it was claimed today.

Billionaire Warren Buffett, the so-called 'Sage of Omaha', has pumped cash into a series of trusts and charities offering family planning advice and care between 2001 and 2012.

Planned Parenthood, NARAL and Buffett's own charity, The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, which is named after his first wife who campaigned for women's rights, were among the beneficiaries.

Buffett has given $289,811,421 to Planned Parenthood alone since 2001, Fox News reported

According to its webside, Planned Parenthood promotes a 'commonsense approach to women’s health and well-being, based 
on respect for each individual’s right to make informed, independent 
decisions about health, sex, and family planning'.

In 2006, two years after his wife died, Buffett gave the foundation that bears her name a substantial gift. He said that he expected the gift to increase the foundation's annual expenditures by $150 million.

In fact, the New York Times reported, total giving by the foundation, where two of the Buffetts' children sit on the board, increased from $202 million in 2007 to $347 million in 2008.

Tax returns show that most of the foundation's spending goes to abortion and contraception advocacy and research.

According to Access Philanthropy, a research institute that focuses on the giving preferences of foundations and corporate donors, family planning is one of the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation's main purposes.

The foundation's non-profit 990 tax form shows that in 2008, Planned Parenthood and its affiliates in the U.S. received about $45 million; the international arm of the organization got about $8 million.

There is no line item for the Ryan program or the Family Planning Fellowship. But the foundation paid out around $50 million to universities with one or both of the programs.

Mr Buffett has never spoken publicly about his views on abortion.

But in the 1990s, according to The Wall Street Journal, the Buffett Foundation helped finance the research and development of the pills that induce abortion.

The foundation also helped finance a lawsuit to overturn the ban on so-called partial-birth abortion in Nebraska, Buffett's home state and the headquarters of his company, Berkshire Hathaway.

In Thompson Buffett's only television interview, which was broadcast after her death, she told Charlie Rose: 'Warren feels that women all over the world get shortchanged. That's why he's so pro-choice.'

According to sexual health study group the Guttmacher Institute, 1.06 million abortions were performed in 2011, down from 1.21 million abortions in 2008, a decline of 13 per cent.

Research also shows the number of U.S. abortion providers declined four per cent between 2008 (1,793) and 2011 (1,720).

The number of clinics providing abortion services also declined 1 per cent, from 851 to 839.

Overall, 89 per cent of all U.S. counties lacked an abortion clinic in 2011, while only 38 per cent of women live in those counties.
