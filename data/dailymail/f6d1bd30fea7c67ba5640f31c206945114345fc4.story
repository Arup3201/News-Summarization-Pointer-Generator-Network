Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire News Corp chief, has tweeted his dissatisfaction with the news coverage of the burgeoning conflict in Gaza.

The 81-year-old media tycoon, who is an avowed supporter of Israel took to Twitter to call the coverage of events in the Middle East by CNN and the AP biased to the point of 'embarrassment.'

Stirring up controversy, Murdcoch also questioned, 'Why is Jewish-owned press so consistently anti-Israel in every crisis?' and asked if President Obama's 'friends in Egypt' could stop the shelling of Israel.

Reaction to the tweets was swift with BuzzFeed political reporter Andrew Kaczynski saying he wanted whatever 'Rupert Murdoch is smoking' and New Yorker political reporter Ryan Lizza tweeted simply 'wow'.

Murdoch's controversial tweets came as
 the White House on Saturday said that Israel had the right to defend 
itself against attack and decide how to respond to rocket fire from the 
Gaza Strip.

The White House is blaming the ruling Islamic militant Hamas group for starting the conflict.

‘We believe Israel has a right to defend 
itself, and they'll make their own decisions about the tactics they use 
in that regard,’ deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told 
reporters during the president's flight on Air Force One to Asia.

Israel on Saturday hit Gaza with nearly 
200 airstrikes, expanding an aerial assault to include the prime 
minister's headquarters, a police compound and a vast network of 
smuggling tunnels.

Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are in agreement that a de-escalation of the violence is preferred, provided that Hamas stops sending rocket into Israel, Rhodes said.

The Israeli government has called up thousands of reservists and massed troops, tanks and other armored vehicles along the border with Gaza, signalling a ground invasion could be imminent.

Israel launched the offensive on Wednesday by assassinating Hamas' military commander, but Rhodes said the U.S. believes 'the precipitating factor for the conflict was the rocket fire coming out of Gaza.’

He added, 'These rockets have been fired into Israeli civilian areas and territory for some time now. So Israelis have endured far too much of a threat from these rockets for far too long, and that is what led the Israelis to take the action that they did in Gaza.'

Obama has spoken with President Mohammed Morsi of Egypt and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about the situation.

‘They have the ability to play a constructive role in engaging Hamas and encouraging a process of de-escalation,’ Rhodes said.

‘We wouldn't comment on specific targeting choices by the Israelis other than to say that we of course always underscore the importance of avoiding civilian casualties,’ Rhodes said.

‘But the Israelis again will make judgments about their military operations,' he added.

Forty-two Palestinians, including 13 civilians, and three Israelis have been killed in this past week's fighting.
