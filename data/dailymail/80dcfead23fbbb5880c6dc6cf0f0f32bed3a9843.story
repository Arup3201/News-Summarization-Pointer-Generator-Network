Authorities say an explosion has leveled a home, damaged several others and rattled a suburban northwest Chicago neighborhood.

Sergeant Gianni Giamberduca of the Lake County Sheriff's Office tells The Chicago Tribune that no one was injured in the explosion that happened about 10:40 p.m. Friday in Long Grove.

Don Thorp, who lives next to the damaged house, tells the Chicago Sun-Times that a 'second boom' knocked him off his feet and damaged his home.

Explosion: The blast leveled a large family home Sunday night, but fortunately no one was inside at the time

All hands on deck: Fire departments in the area worked together to contain the flames

At 1:20 a.m. Saturday, firefighters from several departments still were working to contain the blaze and some homes had been evacuated.

A gas line at the home continued to shoot flames several feet high two hours after the explosion. Insulation from the home was found as far away as half a mile.

The explosion was possibly caused by a gas leak.

Leveled: The home collapsed from the force of two explosions, thought to be caused by a gas leak

Widely affected: Many residents thought the blast that rocked their homes was an earthquake

Extensive damage: Many of the surrounding homes had their windows blown in

'We had people calling in thinking it was an earthquake,' Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sergeant Gianni Giamberduca said.

It was loud enough to be heard two towns away, Giamberduca said.

A woman who lived in the house that was leveled had either stepped outside at the time of the explosion or managed to escape before her home collapsed around her, he said.

A neighbor of the home at 4771 Trenton Court said there were two explosions, the first a smaller blast and the second the one minutes later that reduced the home to rubble.

'I was knocked off of my feet by the second boom,' Don Thorp told the Sun-Times. 'All my bathroom windows were blown out.'

Thorp and his wife were unable to return to their home after the explosion Friday night.

Numerous fire department from the region responded to the incident, with tanker trucks brought in to drain water from ponds to help contain the fire.Â 

About 25 to 30 other homes were damaged by the explosion.
