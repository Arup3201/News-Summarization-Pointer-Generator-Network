Anthony Marshall, who served time in prison last year for looting the estate of his multimillionaire philanthropist mother Brooke Astor, has died aged 90.

Marshall, a decorated World War II veteran who later became a diplomat and Broadway producer, died on Sunday morning in New York, his attorney Kenneth Warner said.

Warner didn't have information on the cause of death, but Marshall had suffered heart problems for years and he was granted medical parole last year after doctors said he had Parkinson's disease. 

His wife Charlene announced his death in the New York Times on Monday in a cryptic obituary that failed to mention his socialite mother, who passed away in 2007 at the age of 105, or his two adult sons, Philip and Alec, who testified against him in his trial in 2009.

Marshall, who was Astor's only child, was convicted in October 2009 of exploiting his mother's dementia to loot her $200 million fortune in the final years of her life.

Prosecutors said that after her Alzheimer's diagnosis, he bought himself lavish gifts, including a $920,000 yacht, with her money.

He also took valuable artwork off her walls and engineered changes to her will that gave him control of most of her estate, including millions previously earmarked for her favorite charities. 

Brooke Astor had married Vincent Astor, a descendant of one of America's first multimillionaires, and gave away eye-watering sums of money to the St Regis Hotel, the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Art Museum, as well as other charities.

She received the nation's top civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was a fondly regarded fixture in the city's society set.

But she was left to spend her last days in allegedly heart-breaking conditions - she was forced to live on pureed peas and oatmeal, while she slept in her own urine at her Park Avenue apartment, according to Marshall's son Philip.

Philip brought a guardianship case against his father in 2006. The allegations of physical neglect were never substantiated, but they led to the criminal case over Astor's finances.

His trial plunged jurors into a world of Park Avenue apartments and sprawling estates. Witnesses included Astor friends Henry Kissinger and Barbara Walters.

Marshall's lawyers said he had the legal power to give himself gifts with his mother's money, and he believed she wanted him to have them. The defense lawyers also argued that Astor was lucid and acting out of love when she altered her will to benefit her son.

Jurors disagreed and found Marshall guilty of grand larceny and scheming to defraud.

He was sentenced to one to three years in prison - but years of appeals and legal wrangling off his sentence for years.

In that time, Marshall urged a judge to spare him a prison sentence. He described in court papers an often sad, if privileged, childhood. He painted his father - Astor's first husband, New Jersey state Sen. J. Dryden Kuser - as an alcoholic who pushed the pregnant Astor down a flight of stairs.

After they divorced, Astor married stockbroker Charles Marshall, who virtually banished her son to a series of boarding schools and summer camps, Anthony Marshall claimed.

But he could not get out of the prison sentence and, following the delays, he started serving time in June 2013.

He was granted medical parole two months later, with a state parole board finding that he was suffering from debilitating and permanent, though not terminal, illness.

The board asked whether he had regrets about the events leading to his imprisonment, according to a transcript. 'Well, regrets, yeah,' he said. 'Naturally.' 

He told parole commissioners he was unable to stand up or walk for long. While he said he was fuzzy about the date and how long he'd been in prison, he said his memory overall was 'fair'.

But when asked whether he recalled the allegations that led to his conviction, he didn't hesitate.

'I remember it,' he said according to a bedside interview with the parole board. 'All too well.'

At the time, he told the board he 'loved' his mother and 'found her to be an extraordinary person.'

'We had lots of things in common, particularly a sense of humor, and we went on lots of trips together,' Marshall continued, singling out their frequent summer vacations in Italy.  

As well as his declining health, the parole board also considered the $14.5 million in restitution he had paid for stealing from his mother to fund a Maine estate and 55ft yacht, among other luxuries. 

The Astor family made their money in the fur trade in the 1700s.

Marshall's step-grandfather, John Jacob Astor, was the wealthiest passenger to die on the Titantic, where he was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck. 

Final years: Marshall's son accused his father of neglecting Astor (pictured left in 1991 and right in 2002, when she was 100) and leaving her to sleep on a urine-soaked bed. The allegations were never substantiated

While his obituary, for which his wife paid, fails to mention his two sons,  it speaks of his fondness for his stepchildren, Arden, Inness and Robert - 'particularly his stepson Robert with whom he formed an everlasting and most loving bond'.

It continues: 'During the course of his life, he helped countless young people get their own start in life by introducing them to those who could provide internships or jobs or sometimes he would write a check to tide one over until they could make it on their own. And then he relished in their success.' 

It lists other achievements including working as a 'talented wildlife photographer... an early conservationist, author of seven books and a highly respected three-time United States Ambassador.'

He also served his country as a young Marine, and earned a Purple Heart, before working as a decoder at the State Department, Consulate General to Turkey and then for four decades with the CIA and the U.S. Ambassador to Madagascar, the Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, and Kenya.

'Tony had the tenderest of hearts, a brilliant mind and an outrageous sense of humor. It was my honor to love and be loved so tenderly by Tony for more than 25 years,' his wife Charlene wrote.
