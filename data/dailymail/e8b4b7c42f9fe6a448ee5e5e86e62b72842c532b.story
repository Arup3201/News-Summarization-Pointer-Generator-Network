The family of stricken F1 legend Michael Schumacher has issued a statement saying they are 'speechless' at the continued love and support of fans worldwide as he continues to struggle to regain normality at his mansion home in Switzerland.

On his reactivated website wife Corrine, 45, and children Mick, 15, and Gina-Maria, 17, say: 'Every day wishes for his recovery arrive and the extent of sympathy for him makes us speechless. We can only say thank you for that, that you fight with him and us together. We remain confident and hope for the best for Michael. Your strength helps us continue to support him in his fight.'

The message was posted on Schumacher's re-booted website - http://www.michael-schumacher.de- which was launched again today.

But it contained no new information about the state of his health as he battles to recover from the catastrophic brain injuries he suffered while skiing in the French Alps on December 29 last year.

Schumacher, 45, was not expected to last the night after smashing his head on to rocks hidden beneath snow. 

But after two emergency operations following the accident he spent months in the University Clinic in Grenoble, followed by a short stay at the rehabiliation clinic in Lausanne, Switzerland, before being transferred to a purpose-built medical suite in his mansion at Gland in September where he is cared for by a team of 15 medical experts.

It is understood he has still not regained the power of speech and has just limited movement of his limbs. The team caring for him includes:

1) Kai Schnapka, 35, his long-term physiotherapist, leads three people charged with massaging his muscles which have wasted during the months of immobility, trying to coax co-ordinated movements out of him during his limited moments of awareness of his environment.

2) They in turn are supported by four carers responsible for turning, cleaning and feeding him, cleaning his mouth, eyes and skin and changing his catheters.

3) There are three nurses, each working an eight hour shift: he is never left alone. Their primary task is to watch out for the urinary and airways infections that are the greatest risk to patients like him in a state of 'minimum consciousness.'

4) There are two doctors on call around the clock, monitoring physical and mental progress. Both are trained in neuropsychology, the study of the structure and function of the brain as they relate to specific psychological processes and behaviors.

5) An airways management and ventilation therapist is on hand to regulate the machinery he still needs to breathe for long periods of time, particularly during the nighttime hours. This respiratory therapist (RT) is responsible for setting up the ventilator, doing the daily checks, changing ventilator settings based on physician's order and performing general ventilator maintenance.

6) Not based at the house but in constant video and telephone contact is Gérard Saillant, a physician and friend of Schumacher. He is the founder and president of a brain Institute and operated on his broken leg suffered at Silverstone in 1999. He was formerly the chief of trauma surgery at the Paris hospital Pitié-Salpetriere. He advised the brain specialists who treated Schumacher at the Grenoble University Clinic where he was treated for the first 154 days following the accident last year.

In addition to the medical team the security team at the house has been beefed up from two to six following a media scrum outside its gates at the start of September which resulted in the local police being called to assist.
