President Obama's top military general told a U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday that American troops might soon provide Iraqi forces with 'close combat advising' in the fight against the ISIS terror army.

That clarification of the Pentagon's mission in the Middle East could mean that U.S. soldiers and Marines are embedded with Iraqi army units, helping them conduct warfare. 

Gen. Martin Dempsey, who chairs the military's joint chiefs of staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the American military is currently serving a purely advisory role. But in certain circumstances, he said, they might provide 'close combat advising.'

Citing a hypothetically urgent mission focused on 'retaking Mosul' as anti-war protesters provided frequent interruptions, he said he could envision U.S. troops 'accompanying that mission.'

Asked by New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte whether the president has ruled out the use of American ground forces in a combat role, Dempsey responded, 'Yes. But he has told me as well to come back to him on a case-by-case basis.'

He said that if needed, he 'would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of ground forces.'

In his opening statement, he said that 'if we reach the point where I believe our advisers should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific ISIL targets, I will recommend that to the president.'

ISIL is an alternate name for ISIS. 

President Obama has maintained that American forces won't have a combat mission in Iraq.

But Oklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe said Tuesday that he's not convinced the White House is true to its word.

'It will take an army to beat an army, but instead the President presented a limited counter-terrorism strategy,' Inhofe said during the hearing.

'His claim of "no boots on the ground" is an insult to the men and women in Iraq today who are serving in harm’s way. We already have boots on the ground in Irbil and in Baghdad and throughout Iraq.'

Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel faced multiple questions from lawmakers in the first high-stakes hearing examining Obama's expanded military campaign to counter the relentless terrorist threat from Middle East extremists.

The U.S. military conducted strikes near Baghdad against ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. ISIS has seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria. 

Obama is seeking congressional support to train and equip vetted Syrian moderates fighting both the Islamic militants and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.

Dempsey said the United States is prepared to strike Islamic targets in Syria.

'This will not look like "shock and awe" because that is not how ISIL is organized. But it will be persistent and sustainable,' Dempsey said, referring to the air bombardment at the start of the Iraq war in March 2003.

Hagel seconded him.

'Because ISIL operates freely across the Iraqi-Syrian border, and maintains a safe haven in Syria, our actions will not be restrained by a border in name only,' he said.

Several lawmakers have their doubts about the United States being pulled into a larger war, with increasing numbers of American troops. The president has already dispatched more than 1,000 Americans three years after combat forces left Iraq.

Many Republicans and Democrats have expressed reservations about the ability to identify moderates in a country awash with rebel formations and shifting alliances. The Islamic State grew out of the al-Qaeda movement, but the two are now fighting. In some instances, the moderate Free Syrian Army has teamed with al-Qaeda's local franchise, the Nusra Front.

Hagel said the U.S. will monitor them closely to ensure that weapons don't fall into the wrong hands.

'There will always be risk in a program like this, but we believe that risk is justified by the imperative of destroying ISIL – and the necessity of having capable partners on the ground in Syria,' the defense secretary said.

Anti-war protesters filled the front rows at the hearing, chanting 'No more war! No more war! No military solution!' at the start of the session and repeatedly interrupting testimony.

'War is not the answer!' one activist yelled as Hagel was introduced. Committee chairman Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, snapped.

'Would you please now leave? I'm asking you to please leave. You're acting very warlike yourself,' Levin told them.

Hagel said the involvement will not be 'an easy or brief effort. We are at war with ISIL, as we are with al-Qaeda.'

Gen. Dempsey said President Obama 'has told me ... to come back to him on a case-by-case basis' about whether American troops need to escalate their involvement in Iraq

Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met in the Oval Office with retired Marine Gen. John Allen, who is coordinating international efforts to combat the Islamic State militants. Brett McGurk, a top Iraq adviser at the State Department, also took part in the meeting. 

Racing to finish its work and leave Washington for midterm campaigning, House Republicans finalized legislation to authorize the mission to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels.

The authorization under consideration will be included as an amendment to a spending bill Congress must pass to keep the government open until mid-December. That would give lawmakers the opportunity to hold a separate debate and vote on the matter – something members of both parties want. Votes could come as early as Wednesday.

Bowing to congressional fears that any vote is tantamount to a war vote, the legislation includes a provision stating that 'nothing in this section shall be construed to constitute a specific statutory authorization for the introduction of U.S. armed forces into hostilities or into situations wherein hostilities are clearly indicated by the circumstances.'

The provision reflects a congressional divide between hawks seeking tougher action than that proposed by Obama and lawmakers weary from more than a decade of U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The measure compels the Pentagon to present Congress with a plan 15 days before any training begins and requires ongoing updates every 90 days.

The U.S. plan is to develop moderate Syrian forces at Saudi Arabian training sites before helping them return to the battlefield. It's unclear how long they would need to be trained to be battle-ready or how the U.S. could ensure their attention remained on fighting extremists and not just the Syrian government.
