Goods seized from criminals including a replica German armoured vehicle and a diamond Rolex watch have been sold by police on eBay. 

The armoured tank, which was a replica of those used during the Second World War, was confiscated by officers from David Barrett, a convicted drug dealer from Nottinghamshire.

Barrett was jailed for 13 years in April 2011 for conspiracy to supply heroin and amphetamines.

He denied the charges but was found guilty by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court.

According to the ebay listing, the tank was not road worthy but was thought to have been built on a 110 Land Rover chassis and had a turbo diesel engine.

The SDKFZ 222 'Helga' tank was taken under the Proceeds of Crime Act and then posted on eBay by nearby Leicestershire Police, who specialise in goods recovered under the act.

The vehicle then sold on the auction site for £5,205, with the money being ploughed back into crime fighting work.

The armoured car is among a number of items that have been sold by the Leicestershire force, who have raised £1million in online sales of goods seized from criminals.

Other popular items have included a DB Aston Martin, which went for £63,000 and a diamond Rolex bought for £13,000.

Anyone interested has until June 4 to place their bid for the jet ski, which has a starting price of £500

Currently advertised on their eBay page is a Kawasaki jet ski and trailer, which has a starting price of £500 and expires on June 4.

The items for sale have usually been obtained by criminals through legitimate channels, but have been paid for out of the profits of drug-dealing, fraud, or other cash-generating offences.

Paul Wenlock, the head of Leicestershire Police's economic crime unit, said: 'Leicestershire Police was the first force in the country to set up its own eBay shop, and it has been a huge success.

'We have generated possibly twice as much from these sales than if we had sent the same items to auction.

'The site is also a daily reminder that we will take civil as well as criminal action to ensure criminals do not benefit from their crimes.

'In some cases we have been able to seize goods and sell them where we have not managed to secure a criminal conviction.

'All the money that the site generates goes back to fund crime-fighting work.

'Often the enquiry starts from information from members of the public. If you know anyone who appears to be living a lifestyle beyond their visible means, we would like to know. They may be living on the proceeds of burglary, money-laundering, fraud or drug dealing.

'We can take both civil and criminal action to be sure they do not benefit from these activities.'
