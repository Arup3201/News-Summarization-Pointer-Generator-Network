Since exploding on to our screens on The Only Way Is Essex, Ferne McCann has become one of the show's standout cast members and  her sense of style and inimitable personality won over the nation.

Much like her co-stars, who have all ventured into various style and beauty businesses, Ferne has channeled her love of fashion and food into a new website. 

The reality TV star promises that Fashionable Foodie is the go-to destination for all things fashion and food - her two greatest passions.

Ferne McCann has fused food and fashion with her new website, aptly named The Fashionable Foodie, with styling, beauty and eating out guides after being 'inundated' with fan requests

Ferne, 24, says she will bring readers exclusive content including fashion, recipes, hair and beauty tips, make-up tutorials, restaurant reviews, celebrity foodie interviews and much more. 

The former hair stylist says she was inundated with requests for fashion and beauty advice so created the site to offer followers her top style and make-up tips. 

She plans on keeping her fashion fans up-to-date with her latest outfit choices with her very own style diary. 

As well as a round-up of all her top looks from the week and her style crushes, 'Ferne on fashion', as it's dubbed, will also be out in force on the red carpet, covering events and premieres.

Ferne will keep followers posted with her ‘#Wear2Eat’ guide, which she describes as the ultimate fusion of food and fashion where she will diarise her look to suit her choice of restaurant or bar. 

Following the latest food trends, recipes and inspirations, she will document her favourite food news on a cookery video page called ‘Demo-lition’, list her favourite foods in ‘Culinary Cult’ and share her eating guides in ‘Ferne's Fridge’ on the website. 

Speaking about her latest venture, Ferne, who has already designed her own range for Lasula, said: 'I am really excited to announce the launch of my official website blog, Fashionable Foodie. 

'I always get approached for advice and tips and I wanted to create a free and accessible go-to guide for all things fashion and food.'

Ferne McCann's official website blog 'Fashionable Foodie' is now live, visit www.fernemccann.co.uk and visit @fernemccann for Twitter and Instagram.
