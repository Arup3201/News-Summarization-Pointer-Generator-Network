A husband, who booked a surprise wedding anniversary camping trip for his wife and five children, died alongside two of his sons on a freak hiking accident in Reynold's County, Missouri, while on the holiday.

David Decareaux, 36 of Millstadt, Illinois, died alongside Grant, 8, and Dominic, 10.

Reynolds County Sheriff Tom Volner said Decareaux, an experienced hiker and an Air Force veteran, took a wrong turn while exploring the Ozark Trail with his sons and pet dog on Saturday. 

He was found dead at the scene and his two boys were declared dead later in hospital after paramedics fought for hours to save them.

Happily married: David Decareaux had arranged his family's hiking trip to surprise his wife of 14 years, Sarah. He got lost with his two sons on Saturday and their bodies were discovered on Sunday morning

Conditions on the trail changed suddenly on Saturday evening with the temperature dropping from 60 degrees to the 20s and heavy rain making it impossible to navigate around the area.

Decareaux had been wearing only a light jacket, while one of his sons was clad in a fleece pullover, and the other a sweater, all three died of exposure to the elements.

A passer-by spotted the hikers more than three hours into their journey and asked if they needed a ride back to the Brushy Creek Lodge near Black, where Decareaux's wife and their three other children – ages 11, 4 and 2 – were staying. But Decareaux declined, telling the man they could make it back, the sheriff said.

'They just missed their turn back to the lodge,' the sheriff said. 'By that time, their light played out. You don't have any ambient light down here because there are no cities or towns. When it's dark you can't see the back of your hand.'

The trip had been organized by Decareaux to surprise his wife for their wedding anniversary. 

'That was just something they would do,' his father-in-law, Keith Hartrum, of Waterloo, told stltoday.com, 'They are very adventurous.'

Sarah Decareaux told the website about the paramedics' struggle to save her children: 'They took my babies and worked on them for more than two hours.'

'We are a Christian family,' she told the local news site. 'I know where they are now.'

Ms Decareaux raised the alarm when her husband failed to return and officials at the lodge called the sheriff's department about 7 p.m. Saturday.

A search involving more than 50 volunteers on foot, horseback and in vehicles lasted until about 12:30 a.m. Sunday, when flash-flooding in creeks forced searchers to back off until daylight.

The bodies of Decareaux and the boys were found soaking wet Sunday morning, their dog was alive beside them.

The tragedy crushed Decareaux's father-in-law, who described the family as tightly knit, "always on the go and adventurous."

Decareaux was a doting father and spiritual man who had retired from the Air Force in recent years and was working with the Defense Department in a job he couldn't discuss, even privately, Mr Hartrum said.

Decareaux and his wife, Sarah, were married about 14 years ago after a chance meeting that was 'love at first sight,' he said.

'They had a strong, good, healthy marriage,' he said, noting the Decareaux was an experienced hiker 'who just got caught up (last weekend) in a freak situation' that proved fatal.

'Dave was a great guy, a good father, son-in-law and husband,' Hartrum said. 'Those two boys were just precious – smart, very nice kids.'
