A local Catholic church official said: 'We believe his love for women is an expression of God's wonder in making them beautiful. He is still a celibate priest as his calling dictates.' The priest is seen in the middle. 

In his Facebook profile there are also others pictures less controversial but also a few striking ones, such as one where you can see the priest is dressed up as fighter or where he is driving a quad bike

The priest, who comes from the Mexican state of Guadalajara, said in his Facebook profile when he arrived to the new parish: 'I thank wholeheartedly all my friends that are happy for me because I am in a new parish. Thank God I am here with them'

In that picture Raquel Patricio, one of his followers, said 'Father, did you borrow this pretty car?

'I do not know how much a priest can earn but I know one or two and they are very humble and do not have the money for this kind of thing.'
