England gave their full backing to one-day captain Eoin Morgan after he was caught up in a bizarre attempted blackmail plot over his personal life.

Morgan was due to lead England against Australia here at the Bellerive Oval  despite Scotland Yard becoming involved in a botched plan to demand £35,000 from Morgan over a relationship he had with a Hobart woman.

The ECB are satisfied that Morgan has done nothing wrong but the blackmail plot was an unexpected and unwelcome distraction for an England team who were looking to build on their comprehensive victory over India in Brisbane.

The ECB received an email demanding money or details of Morgan's past relationship would be revealed

One of the more unexpected dramas involving an England cricketer emerged when the ECB attempted to defuse the potential embarrassment of the saga by going public on the details of the scam.

The fiancé of a woman Morgan had a relationship with five years ago, before he met his long-term Australian girlfriend Tara Ridgway, sent two emails to the ECB threatening to release details of the fling unless he was paid £35,000.

Nick Emery said he would release ‘sexually charged’ messages and videos involving Morgan and his now fiancé Brooke Tsakirakis, unless he was paid the money before the start of this morning’s Tri-series match here in Hobart.

The ECB immediately told Scotland Yard about the plot and British detectives were able to track the man down within 24 hours. Emery then withdrew his threat, saying he was ‘in a bad head space.’

Paul Downton, England’s managing director, was then forced to deal with the latest and perhaps most extraordinary drama of an eventful first year in the job which has seen him oversee the departures of Andy Flower and Kevin Pietersen, the appointment of Peter Moores and the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain which led to Morgan’s appointment last month.

The ECB confirmed no further action would be taken against Morgan's would-be blackmailer

‘There were references to a relationship Eoin Morgan had five years ago with a single Australian lady,’ said Downton. ‘It was a brief relationship and this appears to be a fairly deliberate attempt to extort a sum of money from the ECB. The man has now apologised saying he did not intend it to go this far.’

The ECB decided not to press charges against Emery and consider the matter closed but Morgan will be very much under the spotlight in front of Australian crowds now.

The Irishman is a cool, calm character who keeps his private life very much to himself and takes satisfaction from the fact that not even many of his team-mates know much about him or even where he lives.

There was no suggestion that he would miss the upcoming game and his failure to appear before the media on the eve of the game was hardly unusual as the one-day captain does not always give the pre and post match press conferences. He will shrug off any barracking he may receive.

But England, who have had a traumatic year ever since they were thrashed 5-0 here in Australia during the last Ashes, must wonder what on earth will come next as they attempt to have a more settled 2015 than last year. This is the most unlikely of distractions before a big match.
