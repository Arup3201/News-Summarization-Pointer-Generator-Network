Posing in beachwear at a sun-soaked South American resort, they look like ordinary British holidaymakers rather than the hostages of a drug baron.

Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, both 20, claim they were kidnapped in Ibiza and threatened at gunpoint by a Colombian gang who told them to smuggle £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru.

But the two face difficult questions after photographs emerged of them posing on a balcony and with beers on a beach days before they were arrested at Lima airport.

Carefree: Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly happily pose on a balcony in Peru where they are accused of smuggling cocaine

The women claim they were told to take photographs of themselves smiling at various tourist spots in Lima to convince border control officers and hotel staff that they were ordinary travellers.

Miss Reid, from Glasgow, says Colombian henchmen who watched their every move even told her she was ‘not smiling enough’ as they photographed themselves on the Inca Trail in the Andes.

But detectives in Lima say their story is ‘illogical’ and prosecutors are likely to use the pictures to claim they were offered cash and a luxury holiday to Peru in return for smuggling cocaine.

Miss Connolly, from Northern Ireland, has admitted that they were flown first class to Lima. It was also claimed yesterday that the women were seen going on a huge spending spree there.

Melissa’s father William Reid, 53, who flew to Peru to be with his daughter as she faces several years in jail, admitted the photographs were ambiguous.

He said: ‘I want to know who took that picture of them on their balcony. Was it taken by a third person or by a minder, and who was drinking the beer? 

‘That isn’t Melissa’s beer in the photo because I have never in my entire life seen her drink beer.

'She drinks a lot of water and, if she is drinking, it would be vodka.’

Mr Reid protested his daughter’s 
innocence and said she had told him that the gang forced them to try to 
blend in with other tourists during their five-day stay.

Mr
Reid, a manager at a gas company, said: ‘I believe the trip to the 
beach was part of the set-up – that they asked them to smile to build up
a portrayal of them as happy holidaymakers.

‘Melissa
said they said they had been told by the men that they weren’t smiling 
enough in the pictures and they told them to look happier.

‘I can only go by what I have been firmly told by the girls.

‘The
two girls’ stories are very tight, very consistent, with a lot of 
detail and they seem to be telling the truth as far as I can gauge.’

His
daughter had never shown any interest in travelling to Peru, he said. 
‘She was already on her dream holiday with her friend from home and she 
was so excited about going to the discos and the clubs.

It was also claimed yesterday that the Michaella (pictured) and Melissa were seen going on a huge spending spree there

‘Melissa would never plan visits like this. 

‘To me that suggests she was not there willingly.’

A taxi driver told how he chauffeured the ‘relaxed and happy’ girls around Lima as they spent thousands of pounds on shoes, clothes and jewellery in a three-day shopping spree.

Mr Reid protested his daughter Melissa's innocence and said she had told him that the gang forced them to try to blend in with other tourists during their five-day stay

Martin Huaroto, 45, who works for the Hotel San Agustin Colonial, where the girls stayed, said: ‘They seemed incredibly relaxed and happy – not at all as if they had the world on their shoulders.’

Miss Reid has told the Mail that they feared hotel staff could be linked to the gangs so did not dare ask anyone there for help.

The pair will go before a judge this week, who will decide if they should be charged with drug-trafficking, an offence that carries a jail sentence of up to 25 years. 

They would then wait up to three years for their case to be heard at the Superior Court.
