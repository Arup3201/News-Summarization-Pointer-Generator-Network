If he had won he would arguably be the greatest of all time -  instead Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning barely kept his temper in check during an interview after Super Bowl XLVIII when asked if he felt he embarrassed himself during the game.

The 37-year-old five-time MVP became visibly irritated when asked by a reporter if he thought that the Broncos 43-8 loss and his worst performance of an otherwise record-breaking year was humiliating.

Manning held his cool to answer back that after all his team mates hard work this season, to put the defeat in front of an estimated 100 million viewers worldwide into that context was insulting to him and his fellow Broncos.

Difficult question: Peyton Manning is asked straight out whether he believes his performance in the Super Bowl was embarrassing - to which he replied he believed that suggestion was insulting to him and his team mates and struggled to keep his emotions in check

'It’s not embarrassing at all. I would never use that word,' he said with a stern look at the interviewer.

'There’s a lot of professional football players in that room, that locker room, who put a lot of hard work and effort into being here and into playing in that game.

'The word embarrassing is an insulting word, to tell you the truth.'

Manning has carried around criticism that he has always failed to live up to his potential and last nights performance was arguably his worst defeat.

'It’s not an easy pill to swallow, but we have to,' he said. 'I don’t know if you ever really get over it. You have to find a way to deal with it and process it.'

Indeed, Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman rushed to his defeated opponent's defense last night in the aftermath of the criticism aimed at Manning.

'Peyton is the classiest person/player I have ever met,' wrote Sherman on Twitter. 'I could learn so much from him! Thank you for being a great competitor and person.'

Sherman, who caused controversy with his tirade at Michael Crabtree in which he declared himself the 'best corner in the game', followed his support of Manning up in a subsequent tweet.

'There is no reason to bash him on here. Please Seattle let's just enjoy this one!!! He is still a future HOF player.'

Manning himself blamed the noise of the Seattle Seahawks fans or their famous 12th man for the bungled snap within the first 12 seconds that ended up in a safety and the fastest scoring play in Super Bowl history for any team.

The failed play seemed to set the tone for the rest of the game when center Manny Ramirez snapped the ball when Manning wasn’t expecting it. The football sailed past Manning and bounced into the endzone.

Broncos running back Knowshon Moreno dashed back, got the ball but was tackled by Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril.

'We were using the snap count on the play and due to the noise no one could hear me,' Manning said.

'I was walking up to the line of scrimmage to sort of make a change and get us on the same page and then the ball was snapped.'

The Broncos quarterback still seemed bewildered by the play in the aftermath of the game and even referred to himself in the third person when speaking about it.

'So, really just an overall … nobody’s fault. Not Manning’s fault. Just a noise issue that really caused that play to happen,' he said.

'It was a crazy start,' Manning said.

And
 a crushing end to the greatest season by a quarterback in NFL history, 
one in which Manning shattered several records, most notably throwing 
for 55 TD passes and 5,547 yards.

For his part, Ramirez admitted that he would take the full blame for the embarrassing mistake.

'You never expect anything like that to happen. I believe we’ve had a very good year as far as being able to control the snaps and all that. Of course, I’ll take full blame for that,' he said.

'They capitalized on it and we weren’t able to get going for the rest of the game.'

Despite Manning completing 34 of 49 passes for 280 yards and a touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas - he simply couldn't find a way past the Seahwak's 'Legion of Boom' defense.

'We played a great team. We needed to play really well in order to win, and we didn't come anywhere close to that,' Manning said.

The loss put Manning 1-2 in Super Bowls and 11-12 overall in the playoffs - but Broncos coach John Fox denied that his quarterback had tainted his career.

'I can't really say it out loud, right here, because I get into trouble,' Fox said to ESPN.

'Ludicrous would be proper English.'

More Seahwaks rushed to the defense of Manning - with Seattle defensive end Michael Bennett refuting any criticism.

'Peyton's still the greatest quarterback to ever play the game,' Seattle defensive end Michael Bennett said. 'This doesn't destroy his legacy.'

Broncos tight end Julius Thomas was realistic about how Peyton would remember this season in years to come.

'By no means are we blaming him,' Thomas said. 'Peyton's the reason we're here.'

Over his two seasons 
in Colorado, Manning engineered the greatest comeback in NFL history: 
recovering from neck fusion surgery that weakened his throwing arm to 
win his fifth MVP award this season.

But he 
couldn't match that with the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history 
after falling behind 36-0. Manning hadn't trailed by that much since 
2002.
