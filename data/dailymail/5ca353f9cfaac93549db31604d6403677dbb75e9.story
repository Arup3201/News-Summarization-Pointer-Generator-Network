An American has become the sixth wingsuit flyer to die in the Alps in as many months, it emerged today.

The 33-year-old from California, who has not been named, plunged to earth near the French resort town of Chamonix on Saturday.

His horrific death follows that of former British soldier Mark Sutton, who performed the James Bond stunt at the opening ceremony at the London Olympics last year.

An American has become the sixth wingsuit flyer to die in the Alps in as many months. The 33-year-old from California, who has not been named, plunged to earth near the French resort town of Chamonix on Saturday

Like Mr Sutton, the American was wearing a wingsuit when he jumped from the top of a 2500 meter cliff near the summit of Brevent.

He got into difficulties on the way down, and his lifeless body was later found by mountain rescuers. 

The accident has increased calls for the authorities to reinstate a ban on wingsuits – jumpsuits made of a special fabric which increase the surface area of the body, so allowing users ‘to fly’ after launching themselves from a mountainside or high building, or from a plane.

The idea is that sportsmen can enjoy the feeling of flying before opening a parachute and landing. Mr Sutton, who was Daniel Craig’s double in the hugely popular Olympic stunt, died when he hit a ridge near the Swiss town of Martigny, Switzerland, close to the French border in August.

Last year Chamonix banned wingsuit jumps after the death of a Norwegian jumper, who died when his parachute failed to open.

Mayor Eric Fournier said: ‘For us, adventure doesn't mean extreme risk. This is why the ban was brought in.’

It was lifted in July this year, however, following complaints from extreme sportsmen who argued that they were responsible for their own safety.

‘A new ban is a possibility,’ said a town council source. ‘The number of deaths associated with the sport is of great concern. Safety is always the priority.’
