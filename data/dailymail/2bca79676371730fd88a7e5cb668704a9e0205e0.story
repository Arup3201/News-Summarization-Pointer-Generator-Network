Snow is pounding on Adam’s face and the wind is swirling around his head. It is the first rugby training session of his life and he is forced to rush to the side of the pitch and vomit.

He has quickly realised that absinthe was not the best breakfast ahead of the first day of the new edition of the School of Hard Knocks (SOHK).

Adam is just one of the new recruits for Sky Sports’ seventh edition of the social inclusion programme which uses rugby union as a way to tackle issues surrounding unemployment, antisocial behaviour, crime and health - this time in south Birmingham.

Sky Sports rugby pundits Scott Quinnell and Will Greenwood once again feature heavily - as forwards and backs coach respectively - and they helped to train the players at Moseley RFC.

And, as former British and Irish Lions No 8 Quinnell explains, ‘rugby is less than 40 per cent’ of what the show is all about - the main thing is that it introduces people to a new way of life and aids their job prospects.

The 52-cap Welshman said: ‘The School of Hard Knocks is massively important. These guys have never picked up a rugby ball in their lives so they don’t know how to throw it, how to catch it, to throw it backwards – you have to start from scratch and they need to learn very, very quickly.

‘But it is the other things which are more important than the rugby skills. You cannot underestimate the power that rugby itself can have for these lads to help with other aspects of their lives and allow them to progress.

‘It doesn’t matter where you go around the world, if you walk into a sporting environment - particularly rugby - even if you can’t speak the language, you can have a beer and a talk with anyone from around the world. When you walk into a rugby club, whether you’re eight or 80, a brickie or a doctor, you will still be able to have a conversation with somebody.

‘We try to show these lads the positives in their lives and give them something to look forward to. To get up in the morning. To be able to think of other people rather than just in your own little world because a problem shared is a problem half. A group of friends from a rugby team can help you.

‘It’s about being honest with people and having people who can help. Wherever we do the School of Hard Knocks - these are people who genuinely want help. They want an opportunity in life and that’s the biggest thing.

‘Myself, Will and the rest want to help them in life. To have that support network is very, very important.’

Alongside Adam, Friday’s first episode introduced the audience to the other students on this season’s edition of SOHK, who include JP, who suffers from serious depression; Irfan, a devout Muslim who finds time to pray in a corner of the Moseley clubhouse; and Thomas, who was convicted of a street robbery at the age of 18 and spent three years in prison.

Over the coming weeks, the players will be pushed to the limit through intense training sessions, brutal workouts and social sessions - all with the aim of introducing them to potential employers at the end of the process. If they impress, then companies are lined up to offer these men jobs and help to transform their lives.

And this series sees special appearances from Prince Harry, who joins Paul Allen - a former Bedford and police rugby player who is the first teach coach at the SOHK - to help motivate the players and Matt Hampson, a former England Under 21 international who became paralysed in a scrummaging accident and has since raised money for charity.

‘Prince Harry was absolutely superb,’ Quinnell continues.

‘I’d never met him, Will had met him before - he’ll show you all the photos of him, trust me.

‘But Prince Harry is a tough man - he’s been in the army and he has had lots of things happen to him and he really wanted to get stuck in. He wasn’t the type of guy who stood on the sideline and just smiled. He really got stuck in and helped out.

‘Everyone had a huge amount of respect for him - the guys and the coaches. It was very, very special and everyone realised that. I’m sure that will come across in the programme.’
