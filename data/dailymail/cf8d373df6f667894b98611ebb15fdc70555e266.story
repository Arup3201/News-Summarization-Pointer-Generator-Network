Adam Stinnett had to have his military-style haircut (above) shaved off after the Bobby Ray Memorial Elementary School in Tennessee said it was 'distracting'

A school has forced a seven-year-old boy  to shave off his military-style haircut - despite being told it was inspired by his soldier stepbrother.

Amy Stinnett received a letter from  the Bobby Ray Memorial Elementary School, in McMinnville, Tennessee, the day after her son Adam visited the barbers.

It said his haircut was distracting and would have to be shaved off.

When Ms Stinnett refused to comply the principal told her that Adam would not be able to return to school, Fox News reported. 

An email to Ms Stinnett said: 'I have the utmost respect for the military and its members.

'However we are not a military school and the boy's haircut is against our rules.' 

Adam's stepbrother  served in Afghanistan and is still an active soldier.

He inspired Adam to join the military and is the reason he got the haircut, Ms Stinnett said.

The letter was even more surprising as the school is named after a Navy Corpsman  killed in the Vietnam War.

David Robert 'Bobby' Ray was awarded a Medal of Honor posthumously after using his body to shield a Marine from a grenade in 1969. 

Ms Stinnett said she wants an apology and described the situation as 'crazy' and 'bizarre'. 

She said: 'They shamed my son and they shamed a lot of military people - that's how I feel about it.'

The Warren County School District said it could not comment on the incident or the investigation as it was an internal school matter.

It added: 'Neither Bobby Ray Memorial Elementary, nor any school in Warren County School District, prohibits military haircuts.'

The letter was even more surprising as the school (above) is named after a Navy Corpsman who was killed in the Vietnam War

Navy Hospital Corpsman David Robert 'Bobby' Ray was killed in action during the Vietnam War.

He was born on February 14, 1945 in McMinnville, Tennessee. 

At the age of 21 he enlisted and spent three years serving in the Navy before he was killed.

A Medal of Honor was posthumously awarded for his actions during the Vietnam War. Officers said he used his body to shield a Marine from a grenade on March 19, 1969. The award was given to his family on April 20, 1970.

He also received the Purple Heart Medal, the Combat Action Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with star and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. 

The Warren County School District said: 'We are extremely proud that Bobby Ray Memorial Elementary was named in honor of a true American hero.'
