Just when you thought you knew everything about Dannii Minogue, she goes and admits to having worms.

The glamorous popstar turned fashion designer, who was a judge on The X Factor from 2007-2010, says she owns a worm farm.

'I've got a garden at home I use quite a lot,' the 42-year-old Australian said. 'I've got my herbs and stuff but, what people might be surprised to learn, is that I have a worm farm.

'So, if people say, "Do you have worms?" I can say, "Yes!"'

Dannii made the revelation in a brand new video for eBay, which takes viewers behind-the-scenes on her latest photoshoot for the brand.

Dannii is the face of eBay's Collections, Follow and eBay Today features, which enable people to curate and group items on eBay with the aim of having a more personalised shopping experience on the website.

Fronting the campaign along with Dannii are interior designer and Dragon's Den star Kelly Hoppen, radio presenter Reggie Yates and Blur rocker-turned-cheese-maker Alex James.

Each celebrity hand-picked items from eBay to create their own collections.

In this new footage, Dannii not only discusses her worm farm and passion for gardening, but also her love of hats.

'My go-to item that I'm always looking for is hats - particularly trilby hats,' she says of her fashion collection for eBay.

'I own a lot of them but I've got a really small head so I've got to find ones that fit. I'm also looking for the perfect hat-box to put them in.

'This is my first fashion collection I've put together for eBay. It's got a bunch of stuff from new, vintage â€“ fashion items that are in my home.'

The campaign launched in the UK earlier this month.

More than a million collections have already been created in the U.S. since the feature launched there in late 2013.
