When Roy Hodgson likened Jack Colback to Italy legend Andrea Pirlo within a few minutes of his first international call-up in August, it did the Newcastle midfielder few favours.

Before he had even had the chance to anchor England’s diamond – polishing his passes Pirlo style – he was injured.

Hodgson’s comparison had been much like an art teacher announcing to class that the new student was their very own Michelangelo, only for him to snap his brush in the first lesson.

The headlines and the hype – Ginger Pirlo proved popular – and the subsequent disappointment of the calf complaint which forced his withdrawal, did little for the player’s confidence.

Upon his return to St James' Park, the early-season form which had won him Three Lions recognition stalled. He wasn’t playing badly, but ‘Jack Colback, 6: Neat and tidy’ became the norm.

But United boss Alan Pardew – and, evidently, Hodgson – had seen something more within the former Sunderland man, who quit the Stadium of Light for his hometown club in the summer.

Only now, however, is the wider audience taking note of the combative schemer who marries graft to his craft.

It was the second time in 2014 that Colback had been on the winning side against Chelsea

For Colback, having starred in Saturday’s 2-1 win against Chelsea, is now the only player to have enjoyed a Premier League double over the Blues in 2014.

He was at the heart of Sunderland’s midfield in April when, at Stamford Bridge, he and Lee Cattermole out-fought and out-thought Nemanja Matic and Ramires in a 2-1 victory; that was the last time Jose Mourinho’s side had been beaten in the league before the weekend.

This time, he got the better of Cesc Fabregas and John Obi Mikel and it was from his tackle, forward drive and incisive throughball that Papiss Cisse poached his match-winning second. Colback had been outstanding throughout, reopening the debate about his England credentials.

But those aspirations can wait. For now, he and Newcastle are quite happy changing people’s perceptions.

‘We showed we can match it with the best,’ said the 25-year-old, who was part of the side beaten 4-0 at Southampton in September to leave them bottom of the table.

‘To be the first team to beat Chelsea this season is a great achievement and we were deserving of it. It was tough at times but we showed our quality as well.

‘A lot of people will look at that result and will probably be shocked to see it. But we matched them and didn't give them too much respect, which if you do, can catch you out.’

Chelsea were without loss in 21 this term before their trip to Tyneside - and Colback rates Newcastle’s success as greater than that of Sunderland last season.

‘They were strong in April when I beat them but they have added a lot more quality with Fabregas and Diego Costa and Didier Drogba off the bench,’ he said.

‘They have quality all over the pitch and it is difficult to see a weakness. It is a bit different to last season.

‘Going forward they are a lot stronger. Defensively they have been strong as well and have brushed most teams away, so it was a fantastic win.’

Newcastle are up to seventh following their sixth win in eight and travel to an Arsenal side on Saturday just one place ahead of them on goal difference.

Colback, though, feels the Magpies have laid down a marker with recent victories over Spurs, Manchester City, Liverpool and the league leaders.

‘We go to Arsenal with confidence,’ he said. ‘They are a similar team to Chelsea in the way they play and we have just got to settle it down like we did on Saturday and we can be dangerous against any team.

‘I enjoyed it against Chelsea. It is good to test yourself against the best team in the league and come out on top.’

Forget talk of Pirlo, Colback is proving he is very much his own man right now.
