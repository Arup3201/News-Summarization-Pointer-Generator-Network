While small studio flats are nothing new in London, the rise of 'semi studios' has seen renters in the capital move into 'rabbit hutch properties' that are barely bigger than the legal minimum.

Tiny bedsits on the market for up to £1,040 a month are becoming more common as landlords divide up larger houses and flats to take advantage of the London's booming housing market.

Letting agents have dubbed these 'semi studios', and some are being let for nearly twice the average rent for a one bed flat.

Labour's housing spokesman on the London Assembly said renters were living in 'rabbit hutch properties'

Letting agents price this studio flat at £115 a person a week, but this bedroom is unlikely to fit more than one

By law, a studio flat has to be at least 70 sq ft to house one tenant, while two adults have to be afforded 110 sq ft of living space.

Some of these minuscule studios have such little space that they share toilets with their neighbours, but they are still described as 'charming and compact' by letting agents.

The most expensive of these flats, in West Kensington, costs £1,040 a month, but it's 'mezzanine-style' bed means its future tenant will have to climb a ladder to go to bed.

The bed is so close to the ceiling that they will have to crawl on the bed to get under the sheets.

Another of these flats, a £540-a-month bedsit in Pimlico, central London, is described as 'delightful' but with a 'compact' work space by letting agents.

Its 'very own shower room' is actually a cubicle squeezed in between a table and the kitchen worktop, standing about 3ft from the studio's single bed.

A further semi studio, in West Kensington, will set its tenant back almost £500 a month, despite not having its own toilet and having a shower cubicle crammed between a wardrobe and a window.

Tom Copley, Labour's housing spokesman on the London Assembly, told the Guardian that Londoners were increasingly being forced to pay 'extortionate rents for poor quality, rabbit hutch properties'.

He added: 'The home is at the centre of most people's lives, so the impact on quality of life is enormous. People ought to be able to expect a decent place to live for a reasonable rent.'

Property website Zoopla say the average the one-bedroom property in London sets renters back £377 a week, while four-bedroom homes are advertised for an average £1,085 a week.

This flat costs £477 per calendar month, but at least it comes with a toilet - unlike many semi studios

This means landlords can make hundreds of pounds more in rent every week by dividing up family homes into the small studios. 

Platinum Property Partners, a buy-to-let mortgage lender, said recently that landlords could make up to £38,000 in annual rental income by splitting a family home into flats, compared to around £18,000 if they did not.

Roger Harding, director of communications, policy and campaigns at Shelter, said: 'The fact that London's renters are stuck with these pitiful pint-sized properties is a reflection of the appalling state of our private rented sector.

'Sky high rents and tough competition for homes in the capital means that many renters have no choice but to take the first place they can afford, and are being squeezed into costly, cramped and claustrophobic flats that are far too small for them and their families.'

This narrow single-bed studio costs £480 a month, but is just a short walk from Earls Court Station
