Amazon has launched a web-based version of its popular Kindle e-reader to avoid new charges imposed by Apple on app publishers.

The Kindle Cloud Reader can be launched in an internet 
browser, meaning readers can instantly purchase books straight from 
Amazon without needing the Kindle app.

Since the end of June, all publishers of apps purchased through Apple's App Store must hand over 30 per cent of any profits from content they sell via those applications.

Kindle Cloud Reader: Amazon has launched a web-based version of its popular e-reader to avoid new charges imposed by Apple on app publishers

For Amazon, this meant a huge loss in revenue made by selling electronic books through its hugely popular Kindle app.

As a result, the company last month removed the 'Kindle Store' link button from its app.

Now, Amazon has launched the Kindle 
Cloud Reader, allowing users to save books for offline access and sync 
between the reader's other Kindle products.

It encourages users away from the Apple iOS app by suggesting customers add a link to their home screen.

Currently, the Kindle Cloud Reader only works on Google Chrome and Safari browsers.

Dave Addey, boss of app development 
company Agant, said: 'The store integration is substantially better than
it could ever be in an app.'

He said that most of the features Amazon needs can be accomplished in web app form.

Last week, Amazon removed the 'Kindle Store' link button from its e-book reader to prevent books being bought through Apple.

Retail giant Walmart has introduced new software to its on-demand film service in the U.S. to avoid Apple's new app charges.

Vudu.com now uses software that streams films to iPads without users buying the digital content through Apple's iTunes store.

Before the web app was introduced, users were left to navigate directly to Amazon's website to buy books for the app.

The new profit rules introduced by 
Apple have left users angry over what they see as 'shameful behaviour' 
and recent feedback on the Kindle's App Store page has been highly 
critical.

One user, MMTTCC, wrote: 'If you can't download books from the app, what's the point in having it? Nice going Apple!'

Others are more critical of Apple 
business practices, and see the move as a ploy to make users buy books 
from its own iBooks app.

Salwinder said: 'All Apple has done is
convince me never to buy any more of their overpriced books through 
iBooks ever again. I'm sticking with Kindle.

Last month, Google stepped into the 
breach with the launch of its own e-book reader that will target the 
same market as the Kindle and iBook.

It is the first e-reader to be fully integrated with Google's eBooks platform.

The product, which was launched in the U.S. two weeks ago, will be called the Story HD and will have a built-in QWERTY keyboard.

Amazon's Kindle has proved popular, 
but some analysts believe the e-reader's days might already be numbered 
due to tablet computers.

Apple is currently working on enhanced
eBook features for its iBooks platform according to Patently Apple, a 
blog that tracks the patent applications made by the firm.

It found one such submission that 
'describes systems, methods, and techniques for interacting with text 
displayed on a touch screen, such as text in an electronic book ('eBook'
or in Apple's case, 'iBook')'.

This opens the door, the blogger states, for images, animations, video and interactive content.
