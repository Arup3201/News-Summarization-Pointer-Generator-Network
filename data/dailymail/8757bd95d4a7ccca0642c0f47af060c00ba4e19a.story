Jamie Oliver's cook books have topped the Christmas bestseller list for the last two years but can he retain his title as top TV chef with this year's offering, Save With Jamie?

His latest cook book, published by Penguin, contains recipes showing families how they can cook 'tasty, nutritious food on a budget'.

Released in August, it has already had strong sales - even outselling popular fiction such as Helen Fielding's latest Bridget Jones novel, Mad About The Boy.

King of sales: Jamie Oliver has had the best selling Christmas book for the last two years and is in the running again with Save With Jamie. But could Paul Hollywood take his crown with his Pies and Puds cookbook?

So it's no surprise Oliver's book is expected to make it into thousands of stockings this Christmas.

But Bloomsbury believe they can topple the 'Naked Chef' off his perch with their contender for the Christmas number one - Great British Bake Off's Paul Hollywood.

His latest recipe book, Paul Hollywood's Pies and Puds, was released this week and the publishers expect sales to soar off the back of the popularity of the BBC show.

Bake Off dominance: A recipe book tied in with the popular fourth series of the show is already on sale, left, while a 'Winter Kitchen' edition will be published in November. There are also plans to publish recipes from this year's finalists

The book includes recipes for savoury dishes such as meat and potato pie, rosemary suet pudding, and sausage plait as well as sweet treats like queen of puddings and 'chocolate volcanoes'. 

But Hollywood will face stiff competition from other titles associated with the baking show that has made him a household name.

In November, Great British Bake Off: Winter Kitchen, by Lizzie Kamenetzky will hit the shelves. The book, published by Ebury, will contain recipes for pies, breads, soups and casseroles, as well as 'showstopping' Christmas dinner and dessert ideas.

The winter recipe edition follows the success of the BBC book, The Great British Bake Off Everyday, launched over the summer to coincide with the start of series four.

Healthier options: Lorraine Pascal's Lighter Way To Bake will appeal to those who want a guilt free treat while High Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage Fruit Every Day  will help you get your five-a-day

Contender: Tom Kerridge's Proper Pub Food is also expected to be a festive hit

Featuring recipes from Mary Berry and Hollywood (again), it contains some of the signature bakes, technical challenges and showstoppers they set for this year's contestants.

After 9.1m tuned in to watch the final of the show on Tuesday, the book could see a resurgence in sales before Christmas from fans suffering withdrawal symptoms.

Meanwhile, the Great British Bake Off website states that recipes from the finalists - Ruby Tandoh, Kimberley Wilson and winner Frances Quinn - will be available in November. But they they do reveal if this will be in an entirely new recipe book or an updated version of the Bake Off Everyday title.

But it's not all about Bake Off and Oliver. Other recipe books expected to be festive bestsellers include Lorraine Pascal's A Lighter Way to Bake.

The HarperCollins published cookbook features ways to create lower fat versions of indulgent foods including a reinvention of her chocolate brownies.

Also hoping to corner the market of healthy eaters is Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall with his book released this month, River Cottage Fruit Every Day.

The recipe tome follows on from the success of his River Cottage Veg Every Day - but isn't predicted to shift as many copies as Oliver or Hollywood's offerings.

Meanwhile, other contenders for the Christmas number one include Tom Kerridge's Proper Pub Food, which has already topped the charts on Amazon since it was published in August, and Rachel Khoo's My Little French Kitchen.

It's a recipe for success for publishers with Bloomsbury revealing this week that they've already seen a rise in profits thanks to cookery titles.
