Nick Bonnie and his girlfriend Leah Wilkins. Four friends charged over his death have walked free from court

The distraught mother of a Prince’s Trust worker who died after taking ecstasy on a night out with four friends said her family was irreparably ‘broken’ today as she watched them spared jail for lying to police about the tragedy.

Nick Bonnie, 30, who had been pictured with the Prince of Wales and visited Highgrove and Buckingham Palace through his work with the charity, collapsed after taking the drug while the quintet were enjoying a ‘lads’ weekend’.

As his friends took a taxi to the hospital where he lay dying, they agreed to lie to police about who had supplied the drugs, each sticking to their story as they were questioned while he suffered a fatal heart attack in intensive care.

When they appeared in court yesterday, Mr Bonnie’s mother – who herself works in drugs rehabilitation – movingly addressed the judge about how the family’s lives would never be the same again after the loss of ‘our beloved, beautiful son’.

And Pauline Bonnie hit out at how his friends’ lies had caused them ‘additional anguish and unacceptable stress’ by prolonging their ordeal for more than a year.

She said: ‘In the early hours of September 28 we were told our beloved, beautiful son, brother and partner had died,’ she said. ‘A part of us has died and our lives will never be the same without Nick.

‘We all feel cheated at not being able to see and celebrate Nick marry Leah and have children, and the bright future at The Prince’s Trust that he will never have.’

She added that his friends’ ‘lies’ had caused ‘additional anguish and unacceptable stress’ by delaying an inquest that would have enabled them to grieve properly.

‘Every day for us feels like a mountain to climb,’ she concluded. ‘We are a broken family and we will never get over this.

‘We have lost our sparkle until the day we leave this world.’

Mr Bonnie and his friends, Dean Neale, now 30, Paul Tabb, 31, James Churchill, 31, and Simon Lloyd-Jones, 29, had driven up from their homes around Stroud, Gloucestershire in September last year for a night at the Warehouse Project nightclub in Manchester.

On the way, with the exception of site engineer Lloyd-Jones, who abstained throughout, they took cocaine and ecstasy that Churchill – who owns a gym - had agreed to buy ahead of the trip, and their excitement is plain in photographs as they prepared to set off from the apartment they were renting.

But they became separated from Bonnie over the course of the night, Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester was told yesterday, assuming he had gone back to their room early.

In reality, he had been found unconscious in the courtyard area by security staff and taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary by ambulance.

By the time the quartet was traced, they were back at their accommodation, and immediately took a taxi to be with him, Rob Hall, prosecuting, said, agreeing en route to tell police they had bought the drugs from someone in the club rather than reveal the truth.

‘It may be the view of those who listen that the most obvious motive was to protect Mr Churchill, who clearly was at risk,’ he added.

Mr Bonnie, who was otherwise healthy, died at around 5am from a heart attack caused by ‘excessive consumption of ecstasy’, a post mortem examination revealed.

As a result, police resources were diverted to putting out alerts about a possibly fatal ‘bad batch’ of drugs circulating around the club when in reality the group had brought them from their home county.

It was only when Mr Bonnie’s mobile phone was examined two months later that messages they had exchanged on the WhatsApp social media platform in the run-up to the fateful weekend revealed Churchill had been nominated to supply the drugs, and they were all arrested.

At their sentencing hearing yesterday, they stared straight ahead or at the ground as Mr Bonnie’s mother stood in the witness box and read out sections of her victim impact statement, as his girlfriend Leah Wilkins and other relatives wept in the public gallery.

Barristers for the four men, who all arrived in suits and carrying hold-alls in preparation for prison, argued that they had been deeply affected by the loss of their friend and that a lie which began while all were suffering from the effects of drink or drugs had ‘snowballed’.

Judge Jeffrey Lewis described all five as ‘decent, hard-working young men’, all but one of whom had decided to ‘boost’ their enjoyment of a ‘lads’ weekend’ by taking drugs.

‘Activity of this kind is sometimes described as recreational use of drugs as if such activity were perfectly acceptable and legitimate,’ he said. ‘Quite the reverse – it’s criminal.’

He added that while what they had done may be ‘fashionable’, it was not only illegal, but it could have a profound impact, including ‘from time to time, as occurred on this occasion, with fatal consequences.’

He said they had failed in their duty to their friend to tell the truth about what had happened, but accepted that all had ‘excellent’ work records and were genuinely remorseful, agreeing to suspend their prison sentences.

Churchill, who admitted supplying ecstasy and cocaine, and perverting the course of justice, was given 12 months suspended for 18 months.

Tabb and Neale - an operations manager for a manufacturing firm - were given eight months after admitting possessing ecstasy and cocaine, and perverting the course of justice, while Lloyd-Jones was also given eight months after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice, also suspended.

The four defendants, who are all from Stroud, were also ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work in the community. 

Afterwards Detective Inspector Carl Gilbert, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘This is a very sad case – it’s five lads who’ve travelled to Manchester for an enjoyable night out, and they’re left with one of them dead and the other four in court because of the consequences of one poor choice.’ 

‘To all those who heard on the National news on Saturday 28th September 2013, a 30 year old man from Gloucestershire had lost his life in a Manchester nightclub after taking illicit substances - this was our son, local boy, young man, Nick Bonnie.

‘We don't want to have any obituary or such like printed but have decided that his life was too precious and important to go unreported.

'Everyone who knew Nick was aware he loved life'

‘He played local football for Kings Stanley Youth teams up until the age of 16, Leonard Stanley Under 18s, Brimscombe &Thrupp and finally Cashes Green. Nick was a keen sportsman, avid follower of Liverpool AFC and only last week completed the ‘Tough Mudder’ challenge for Help the Heroes in Wales. Nick was known by many as having a big heart, big personality and the most infectious smile in Stroud.

‘Nick Bonnie lost his life tragically, senselessly and needlessly in a nightclub in Manchester on a lads' weekend. This has devastated the lives of us, his parents, his two brothers Thomas and Ryan, and his beautiful and devoted girlfriend, Leah. Our family and friends, Nick's friends, work colleagues and all those who had the privilege of knowing him and those he helped in his employment at the Princes Trust.

‘Nick was born in King's Stanley and went to the local primary school. He progressed to Marling before taking a gap year and travelling around Australia before gaining his degree at University in Plymouth.

'He returned home to work with a local firm of solicitors in Stroud before embarking on the true vocation of his life, working at the Princes Trust. He has helped many young people in the early stages of his employment with them and helped raise funds and promote the profile of the Trust in his current role. He has been to Highgrove on several occasions and attended one of the Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace.

‘Everyone who knew Nick was aware he loved life, lived it to the max and in making one stupid mistake he has cost himself his life.

‘We hope that after reading this, we may have gone some way in helping anyone/ everyone in the realisation that drinking and use of any illicit drugs are a killer with consequences that will devastate lives for ever.

‘Our thanks go to all those who have taken to time to send messages of support to out family. Our lives and all those who were blessed to share a part of his are broken. Our life will never be the same without Nick and he will never be forgotten.’
