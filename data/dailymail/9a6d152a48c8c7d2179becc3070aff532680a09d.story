Santi Cazorla has been a bit hit and miss this season, but he was outstanding against Newcastle United. 

He scored twice — the perfect present on his 30th birthday — and was at the heart of an Arsenal performance that was a joy to watch. For his first goal he took an excellent touch, rode a challenge and then hit a delightful chip into the corner.

It would have been very easy for him to go down in the area, but he stayed on his feet and was rewarded with a goal.

That was good to see on a day where too many players were diving, including West Brom’s Sebastien Pocognoli, who took a theatrical tumble.

PS The diving this weekend was bad but another problem is the high foot. Last week Eliaquim Mangala was booked for an ugly high lunge and Cheick Tiote was lucky not to be sent off for catching Alexis Sanchez on Saturday. 

It’s a worry because it’s the kind of challenge that can cause serious damage.

SUPER FRANK IS AT IT AGAIN 

Frank Lampard must have an invisibility cloak. That’s the only reason I can think of to explain why so many teams still let him make those late runs into the area to score.

Lampard has hit plenty of 30-yard screamers in his time, but if you had to describe his winner for Manchester City at Leicester, you’d have to say: ‘Oh, just the usual.’

Arriving late in the box is his trademark, but still teams let him do it. When he is in the final third you have to mark him because if you don’t, he will punish you.

Esteban Cambiasso is so experienced but the way he let Lampard in made me wonder if he’d ever seen him play before. 

At this level, attention to detail is everything and you cannot afford to let a player like him have five yards of space in a crowded area. He even pointed to where he wanted the ball! It’s such an obvious weapon, but Leicester didn’t do enough to try to stop it.

PS It seems Man City will have ‘discussions’ with New York City about extending Lampard’s stay. Considering City own the New York club, it won’t exactly be a tricky conversation... 

City: Frank’s doing well, isn’t he... mind if we keep him a bit longer?

NYC: Well, you do actually own us, so in a way he’s your player...

City: Of course he is! Pleasure doing business with you!

SZCZESNY ON SONG 

Wojciech Szczesny has had his critics in the past but he made an excellent save against Papiss Cisse on Saturday night and is impressing me.

He came on to our Sky panel show, A League of Their Own, last week and he struck me as a really nice young man. He was game for a laugh, got stuck in and at 24 is mature beyond his years.

The Pole could go on to rival David Seaman (centre) as arguably Arsenal's greatest ever keeper

David Seaman was nearly 27 by the time he arrived at Arsenal and is arguably the club’s greatest goalkeeper. Szczesny has a long way to go to match that, but he has a bright future.

The only downside was his singing. He had to do a duet with Chesney Hawkes. It’s a good job his goalkeeping is better than his singing!

BURNLEY HIT BACK

Burnley bounced back from defeat at QPR with an excellent result against Southampton.

Burnley have picked up almost a point a game on average, which would ultimately see them earn  survival

Ronald Koeman has seen Saints slump after a better than expected start to his Premier League campaign

In the past 10 years, teams have needed an average of around 37 points to stay up — that’s about a point per game. So Burnley will be pleased with 15 points from 16 games, all things considered.

For Southampton it was disappointing, but that shows how well they have done under Ronald Koeman. Expectations are perhaps too high because they are doing brilliantly.

1997 - Dusan Tadic was something of a penalty specialist at FC Twente, with 11 scored over two seasons. But the Serb missed the chance to give Southampton the lead from the spot at Burnley on Saturday. The last time Southampton missed a Premier League penalty was way back in April 1997, when Jim Magilton missed against West Ham.

83.3% - Juan Mata has scored five goals from just six efforts on target this season. That puts his conversion rate at an impressive 83.3 per cent.

4th - Santi Cazorla became the fourth Arsenal player to score on his birthday after Yossi Benayoun, Robert Pires  and Paul Merson.

92 - It only took Stoke 92 seconds to equalise at Crystal Palace on Saturday. After James McArthur hit the opener for the home side, Peter Crouch replied just over a minute and a half later for the visitors.

3 - Tom Huddlestone's red card at Stamford Bridge means he has now been sent off in three straight seasons. He previously went seven seasons without a red.

63.3% - Crystal Palace completed just 63.3 per cent of their passes against Stoke. Only 10 times this season have teams completed less than 65 per cent — on five occasions it was Palace.

2 - It was not a good day for Aston Villa’s Kieran Richardson. His red card after 22 minutes was the second fastest this season after James Chester’s against Stoke. Also, his two PL red cards have come against his old clubs — West Brom and Man United.
