Rory McIlroy has plenty of work to do in his pursuit of the legendary green jacket but he will have to remain patient in his bid to complete a career grand slam at Augusta.

The world No 1 recovered from a shaky start to card a one-under-par 71 but finished seven shots behind first-round leader Jordan Spieth.

McIlroy must hope for the early runners to drop shots as he's scheduled to go out in the penultimate group with Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore at 6.48pm (BST) on Friday.
