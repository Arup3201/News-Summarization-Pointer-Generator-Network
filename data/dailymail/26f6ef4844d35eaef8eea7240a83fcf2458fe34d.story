They're 100-years-old but the Brownies still know how to party.

The girls' organisation marked their centenary with a special event at Buckingham Palace today.

Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, joined in the celebrations along with her daughter Lady Louise Windsor, who is herself a Brownie. The ten-year-old granddaughter of the Queen showed off an impressive number of badges on her sash - which Brownies earn for carrying out a number of duties and activities.

Her mother looked chic but casual in graphic print trousers and a navy blouse with a gold pin of the Brownie logo.

Sophie is President of the Brownies and had invited 50 members to the party at Buckingham Palace who were chosen following a prize draw.

Next stop Wimbledon! Brownies took to the lawns of Buckingham Palace to play tennis

Inspiration: They were joined by British tennis star Laura Robson, who couldn't play at Wimbledon this year due to injury

Don't let it tumble! A game of Jenga was played by these girls

Today the lucky winners took to the lawns of the palace to play giant games of Jenga and Connect Four.

As Wimbledon took place a few miles away, they also enjoyed a game of tennis - joined by professional player Laura Robson.

The British tennis star hasn't been able to take part in the Wimbledon tournament this year due to injury, which meant she was available to attend the Big Brownie Birthday.

Strategy: Giant Connect Four was another game played

Lucky 50: The attendees were picked following a prize draw

Still going strong: The Brownies were formed in 1914

The Girl Guides Association was formed in 1910 - led by Agnes Baden-Powell, the sister of Robert Baden-Powell who had previously formed the Scouts for boys.

In 1914, a junior section for girls under 11 was formed. They were originally called 'Rosebuds' but were renamed Brownies a year later.

Since then, millions of girls have pledged to 'do their best' in the brown and yellow uniform.
