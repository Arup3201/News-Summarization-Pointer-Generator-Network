Ever imagined what a scene from your favourite movie would look like if the state-of-the art Hollywood cameras were replaced by the one on top of Google's Street View car?

Thanks to the creative joys of the Internet and a new blogging website, you no longer have have to.

It features a range of images which mix famous film scenes with a Street View screen grab of the real life location where they were shot.

Explosion: Even the special effects-heavy Inception is not to much for the Street View treatment

Google vision: Ewan McGregor has his face blurred out as he runs down Hanover Street in Trainspotting

Creative: Thelma and Louise is among the images posted on blogging website googlestreetscene.com

Thelma and Louise, Forrest Gump, Terminator 2 and Trainspotting are among the well known film titles to get an online makeover courtesy of the panoramic map.

In the case of Quentin Tarantino's 1994 classic, Pulp Fiction, a Street View grab of Fletcher Drive in Los Angeles provides the backdrop for Marsellus Wallace - played by Ving Rhames - as he shoots at Bruce Willis' character, Butch Coolidge, from across the street.

Even the special effects-heavy explosion of a Paris cafe in the 2010 blockbuster, Inception, is not too much for Street View to handle.

And just like the interactive map, its star Leonardo Di Caprio gets the full face-blurred-out treatment - just like any other passer-by caught in the lens of the Street View car.

Other locations include County Road, Kansas, complete with the loveable dog car from Dumb and Dumber.

'I'll be back': Arnold Schwarzenegger approaches Hayvenhurst Avenue in LA during Terminator 2

There is also a shot of Hayvenhurst Avenue in Los Angeles, where motorcycle-riding, shotgun-firing Arnold Schwarzenegger gives chase in Terminator 2.

One of the more impressive images is an aerial view of Thelma and Louise, with the leading ladies being tailed by police cars as they approach the edge of the Grand Canyon.

The images are created by Tre Baker and posted on his Tumblr website, googlestreetscene.com.

He told the Daily Dot website: 'I try to say true to the Google Street Scene looking like something you would actually see on GSV

'So no night scenes. No point-of-views from inside of the car. Nothing from a high angle.'
