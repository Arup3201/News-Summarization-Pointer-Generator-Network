A newlywed who pushed her husband of eight days to his death from a cliff, is appealing her own guilty plea and 30-year prison sentence.

Jordan Linn Graham, 22, from Montana, was sentenced to 365 months in federal prison, with no 
possibility of parole after U.S. District Judge Don Molloy did not believe she was remorseful
 for the killing.

Graham's lawyers filed documents on Thursday, the deadline for an appeal, at Missoula district court. They claimed that the prosecution and Judge Molloy reneged on a plea deal where the 22-year-old would plead guilty to second-degree murder.

Graham admitted to killing Cody 
Johnson, 25, by pushing him to his death from a 300ft cliff in Glacier 
National Park on July 7 last year. 

His body was found at the bottom of the cliff three days after he was reported missing by a friend and co-worker.

After she was sentenced
 last month to the maximum of 30 years, Graham tried - and failed - to 
withdraw her guilty plea - despite the fact her attorneys asked for a 
10-year sentence in exchange for change of plea.

Her defense attorney Michael Donahoe had 
previously said in a motion that her ‘extremely reckless but 
unintentional act’ only warranted 10 years in prison.

Her
 attorney's filing this week claims that Judge Molloy failed to take 
into account that accepting the plea meant she had not premeditated her 
new husband's death. Graham's defense team also claims that the judge made improper calculations when deciding on her sentence.

Details on how Judge Molloy calculated the 22-year-old's sentence were sealed.

Before he accepted her plea in December, the judge asked Graham to tell him what happened.

Graham
 said she was having second thoughts about being 
married so young and that she and her husband went to the park to talk about it.

They went over a retaining wall along the Going-to-the-Sun Road and climbed down a rocky, steep slope to the edge of a cliff and a steep drop of a couple hundred feet to a ravine.

There,
 facing the void, she told Johnson that she wasn't really happy and she believed she should not be married,
 she said.

They
 argued and it escalated, culminating with Johnson grabbing her, Graham 
said. She thought he was going to pull her toward him - and that's when 
she became angry.

'I wasn't thinking about where we were,' she said. 'I just pushed.'

She
 said she brushed away his hand and then pushed her new husband with one
 hand on his back and one hand on his shoulder, and he went over the edge.

It
 wasn't planned, but she said it was 'definitely reckless with an 
extreme disregard' for life. Afterward, she ran back to where the car 
was parked.

She drove back home to Kalispell, 
about an hour away, without seeking help. She sent text messages to 
friends on the drive back - but told nobody what had just happened.

'At that moment, I was so scared, I didn't know what to do,' she said.

Johnson was reported missing on July 8 when he failed to show up for work.

Graham
 initially told investigators that Johnson left their house on July 7 with 
friends. But his friends testified they were suspicious of the story and
 suspected Graham played a role in his disappearance.

Graham showed police a fabricated 
email - purportedly from a friend of Johnson - that said Johnson was 
dead and to call off the search.

She
 later told Glacier rangers she had found Johnson's body near The Loop 
because it was a place he wanted to see before he died.

Ultimately, 
Graham acknowledged she was with Johnson on the cliff after 
investigators confronted her with a security camera photo of the couple 
entering the park.
