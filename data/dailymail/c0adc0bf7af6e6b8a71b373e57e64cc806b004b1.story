Around one hundred activists clutching the bodies of dead animals assembled in the centre of Melbourne, Australia, to protest violence and neglect towards animals.

The protestors, from Animal Liberation Victoria (ALV), silently held dead sheep, pigs, kangaroos, chickens, fish, ducks and other species, claiming they wish to draw attention to the ' hidden suffering of animals in Australia and around the world'. 

The carcasses were found by ALV's rescue team, many of them dead or dying inside industrial animal factories, in paddocks or hit by vehicles and left to die, according to the organisation.

ALV says the cruel treatment of animals is 'one of the world's largest social justice issues' and said similar displays of respect for the billions of animal victims have taken place in Spain, Chile, France, Germany and Peru.

'We are here today to draw attention 
to the fact that humans are currently responsible for the slaughter of 
64billion land animals around the world each year, and between one and 
three trillion sea animals,' said ALV’s campaign co-ordinator Noah Hannibal.

'Like us, these animals have an 
interest in living and not suffering and we cannot ignore their 
interests simply because they do not belong to our species.'

Animal Liberation Victoria is the Melbourne-based branch of Australian animal rights movement Animal Liberation, which operates throughout Australia.

It was founded in 1978 by Patty Mark and aims are to abolish the property status of animals, animal exploitation and 'speciest attitudes and practices'. The organisation also claims to encourage animal rights education and embrace the principle of non-violence.

It has also protested against sheep exports, whaling, the killing of animals on television by Jamie Oliver and animal deaths in Melbourne Zoo.

ALV operates the Action Animal Rescue Team, a group formed in 1993 whose purpose is 'save the lives of unattended and neglected animals who are left sick and dying in factory farms'.
