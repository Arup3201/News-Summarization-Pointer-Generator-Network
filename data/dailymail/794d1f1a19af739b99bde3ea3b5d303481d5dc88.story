When toddler Leo Fernando leapt through an open first-floor window, his horrified parents feared he would be killed.

But the 23-month-old survived the 20ft fall on to a patio with only a cut knee and a bruised forehead – and it seems his favourite movie character may be the reason.

Leo’s mother thinks he may have been trying to copy Buzz Lightyear, the astronaut from the Toy Story films who launches himself into the air with the cry ‘To infinity, and beyond!’ as he tries – mostly unsuccessfully – to fly.

His parents found him standing on the patio covered in blood - but doctors couldn't find any damage apart from a cut knee and bruised forehead on young Leo

Doctors say Leo survived because he was not scared when he jumped, so his body was totally limp as he hit the ground.

Experts believe you are more likely to
survive a fall if your muscles are relaxed.

They think it helps cushion
the impact, acting rather like shock absorbers. If the muscles are 
tense, as would instinctively happen during a fall, the force travels 
straight to the organs, spine and limbs, causing major injuries.

In car accidents, passengers who are 
asleep have been known to suffer fewer injuries than those who are awake
and brace themselves for impact.

Leo's brother Jay, 3, with mother Emma Bowden and the toddler with father Antony Fernando stand on the spot where the youngster was found

Leo had been playing with his brother 
Jayhan and father Antony, 34, when he bolted towards the open window at 
their home in Exeter.

Leo Fernando tumbled out the first storey of his home and crashed onto the patio

Despite his father’s desperate lunge to stop him, 
Leo leapt out.

His mother Emma Bowden, 27, said 
yesterday: ‘I was in the other room when I heard Antony screaming, “Oh 
my God, Leo’s fallen out  of the window”.

'I screamed and rushed to the 
garden. I didn’t know what I’d find.

'I found Leo standing up with blood 
all over his face and crying.

‘I snatched him up and hugged him and 
my mum called the ambulance.

'I was wiping the blood out of his eyes when
the paramedics arrived.

‘He was in accident and emergency for 
hours as they did X-rays on his whole body, an MRI scan and ultrasound 
checks – but he didn’t have any broken bones.

'The nurses said what saved
his life was that he wasn’t scared and didn’t stiffen up when he fell.

'He also bounced off the lower window sill, which broke his fall a bit.

‘He has been the talk of the hospital. He’s a massive fan of Buzz Lightyear so maybe he can fly too.

To infinity! By copying Buzz Lightyear, the boy managed to survive the high fall
