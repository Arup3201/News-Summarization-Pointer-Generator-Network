Birmingham FC owner Carson Yeung is facing 14 years in prison after being found guilty of five counts of money laundering by a court in Hong Kong.

The 54-year-old had denied laundering £55.4million through his bank account between 2001 and 2007.

But judge Douglas Yau said he was 'self-contradictory' in his evidence and was 'making it up as he went along'.

'I find the defendant not a witness of truth,' Judge Yau told a packed court room. 'I find that he is someone who is prepared to, and did try to, lie whenever he saw the need to do so.'

Yeung will be sentenced on Friday.

The case shone a spotlight on how Yeung made his fortune but the judge said he exaggerated the amount of profit made by his hair salon business.

The trial has also revealed Yeung's close links to Macau's casino world, both as an investor and gambler, and how that enabled business investments that helped him amass his wealth.

He maintained that he built a fortune of hundreds of million of dollars through stock trading and business ventures in China.

But prosecutors said he was unable to show where £7.7million in his bank account had come from.

The Judge's verdict said there was reasonable doubt to believe that various business deals represented 'proceeds of an indictable offence.'

Yeung bought Birmingham in October 2009 for £81.5million from David Sullivan and David Gold, now the co-owners of West Ham.

He is still the majority shareholder but resigned last month as the club's president, director and director and chairman of the club's parent company, Birmingham International Holdings Ltd (BIHL) to await the verdict.

In a statement released at the time to the Hong Kong stock exchange, BIHL said: 'Mr Yeung, with his foresight, aspiration and clairvoyance, has steered the board successfully through landmark projects such as the acquisition of Birmingham City Football club, for which the board is profoundly indebted.

'Mr Yeung unequivocally confirms that he has no disagreement with the board and that there are no other matters relating to his resignation that are required to be brought to the attention of the shareholders of the company.'

Yeung's father and co-accused, Yeung Chung, died in 2012.
