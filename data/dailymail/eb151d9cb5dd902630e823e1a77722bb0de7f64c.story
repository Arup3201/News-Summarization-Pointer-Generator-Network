Sharon Farrell knew she was overweight and struggled to walk long distances, but it was a devastating incident on a packed bus that made her realise she had to take drastic action.

The 45-year-old from St Albans, was travelling to work one cold February morning in 2010 when a passenger pointed out the spare seat next to her to an elderly gentleman.

'He said at the top of his voice: "I can't sit next to THAT! There's not enough room." I was absolutely devastated,' she says.

Weight-loss wonder: Sharon Farrell was 20st 3lb as her heaviest. She has now slimmed down to 10st 1lb (r)

In tears, Miss Farrell got off at the next stop - almost hyperventilating - and struggled into work on foot. But the size 30 worker was so unfit that the 15 minute walk took her an hour.

'I arrived at work hot, flushed and sweating for half an hour afterwards. I realised I had to do something,' she said.

Sharon Farrell is now a svelte size 10

Miss Farrell weighed 20st 3lb with a body mass index of 47.1 - which placed her in the morbidly obese category. But it wasn't until that moment that she could face up to the truth.

'I was in such a bad way 
and was just existing, not living,' she said.

Sharon had always been bigger 
than her friends as a child but her eating went out of control after a family tragedy.

'When I was 19 I lost my father. I was so close him. I didn't realise then but I started eating for comfort.'

She became a yo-yo 
dieter, losing a few stone only to put it back on - and more.

Her eating habits became even worse after her mother became seriously ill in 2004. Sharon struggled to juggle work with caring with her mother at evenings and weekends. 

'I was getting out less and less and 
eating all the wrong foods, like sausage rolls and pastries, crisps, 
chocolate and biscuits, plus a fat-laden ready meal or takeaway for 
dinner,' she said.

'If I did go out in the evening, I'd down about five or six 
pints of real ale.'

By 2006, Sharon was put on anti-depressants and took a career break to look after her
mother full time during her final months. She returned to work but by now was a size 30.

She said: 'I was so unfit I couldn't walk 
anywhere without getting out of breath but until the incident on the 
bus, I didn't have the impetus to do anything about it.'

In March 2010 she joined a local slimming club and within five weeks lost her first stone. She went to three exercise classes a week, kept a food diary and ate a little and often.

'Everything felt so much easier after I
had lost about 3st. My depression lifted, I felt happy for the first 
time in ages and was taken off medication,' she said.

After two years she had lost 9st and had slimmed down to a healthy size 12. Today she weighs 10st 1lb, having lost half her body weight, and is a healthy size 10.

She said: 'I still count my calories 
as it's second nature now. I also do 10 minutes of toning a day, with 
exercises like squats and lunges.'

Her success has earned her the title of Rosemary Conley's Over 40s Slimmer of the Year 2013. She received her award - along with 
£1,000 - from Rosemary Conley at a glittering London ceremony.

She said: 'Losing weight has had such a positive 
effect on my life.  I feel like a totally different woman now.  Last 
year I walked the Race for Life; now I plan to run it. 

'I want to do the
18-mile Chiltern Peak Walk this year and would love to do a marathon.'

Sharon is much happier with her new size. She was taken off anti-depressants after losing her first 3 stone

She added: 'My life has changed completely and I know I will never go
back to the way it used to be.'

And she has a surprising message for the man who made the cruel jibe about her on the bus.

'It kickstarted me. I'd like to say thanks to him now.'
