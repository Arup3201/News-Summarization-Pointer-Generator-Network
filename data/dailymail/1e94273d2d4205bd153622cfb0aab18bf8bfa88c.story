Steven Lewis eked past Luke Cutts in an all-English jump-off to secure pole vault gold at Glasgow 2014.

Having won bronze in 2006 and bagged silver in Delhi four years ago, the 28-year-old completed the Commonwealth set on a sunny night at Hampden Park.

The British champion's jump of 5.55 metres - 27cm shy of his personal best - proved enough after a tense clash with countryman Cutts.

Clear: Lewis pipped compatriot Luke Cutts (pictured) to gold with a jump of 5.55m

Neither managed to clear 5.60m in their three allotted leaps, so the gold was decided with a jump-off.

Having both again failed to clear 5.60m, the bar was lowered five centimetres and, having seen Cutts fall short, Lewis managed to secure gold - the perfect response to losing lottery funding at the end of last season.

Time out: Lewis lies on the track and takes a rest in between jumps during the men's pole vault final
