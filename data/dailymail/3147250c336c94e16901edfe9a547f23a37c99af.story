Native Americans are facing the final deadline in their battle to save the Wounded Knee massacre site - and expressed their outrage at the landowner 'making a buck out of miserable history.'

The land in South Dakota is where U.S. troops killed up to 300 Native American men, women and children in 1890.

James Czywczynski, whose family has 
owned the property since 1968, is trying to sell the 40-acre fraction of
the historic landmark for $3.9 million. He has given the Oglala Sioux Tribe until today to agree to the price or plans to open it up to outside investors.

Chief Joseph Brings Plenty, a former chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and a traditional chief said: 'The reason he asked 
for $3.9m is because of the land's historical significance, based on the
deaths of hundreds of our relatives. If someone turns a buck on our 
ancestors' misery then shame on them.'

Anger: The Wounded Knee Massacre site and mass grave -the site where U.S. troops killed up to 300 Native American men, women and children in 1890 is up for sale

Up for sale: The 40-acre property in South Dakota is on the market for $3.9 million (about £2.5 million)

Sale: James Czywczynski, 74, is trying to sell a 40-acre fraction of the landmark for $3.9 million to the Oglala Sioux Tribe. But leaders on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation say the asking price for a property appraised at less than $7,000 is just too much

The last major bloodshed of the American Indian wars occurred on December 29 when the U.S. troops went into the camp to disarm the men.

According to the U.S. version of the story, a deaf tribesman named Black Coyote resisted attempts to disarm him that morning and in the struggle a shot was fired.

U.S. troops then opened fire in response and a small number of Lakota fighters who still had guns fired back.

The 7th Cavalry overwhelmed the Lakota warriors and began shooting haphazardly killing men, women and children of the Lakota Sioux  - they also wounded at least 51.

U.S. Military authorities awarded twenty troopers the Medial of Honor for the massacre.

Along with its proximity to the burial grounds, the land includes the site of a former trading post burned down during the 1973 Wounded Knee uprising, in which hundreds of American Indian Movement protesters occupied the town built at the site of the 1890 massacre.

The 71-day standoff that left two tribal members dead and a federal agent seriously wounded is credited with raising awareness about Native American struggles and giving rise to a wider protest movement that lasted the rest of the decade.

He didn't return calls
this week to The Associated Press seeking information about the 
prospective buyers.

The ultimatum has caused anger among many tribal members and descendants of the massacre victims.

'I know we are at the 11th hour, but 
selling this massacre site and using the victims as a selling pitch is, 
for lack of a better word, it's grotesque,' said Nathan Blindman, 56, 
whose grandfather was 10 when he survived the massacre

'To use the murdered children, the 
murdered teenagers, the unborn, women screaming and running for their 
lives, using that as a selling pitch ... that has got to be the most 
barbaric thing ever to use as a selling pitch.'

Czywczynski acknowledges the 
historical significance adds value to each parcel of land, which have 
each been at less than $7,000 apiece, according to records reviewed by 
the AP.

Besides its proximity to the burial 
grounds, the land includes the site of a former trading post burned down
during the 1973 Wounded Knee uprising, in which hundreds of American 
Indian Movement protesters occupied the town built at the massacre site.

The 71-day standoff that left two 
tribal members dead and a federal agent seriously wounded is credited 
with raising awareness about Native American struggles and giving rise 
to a wider protest movement that lasted the rest of the decade.

Scene: This is the site where a battle was fought between the US Army and Sioux Indians. After the battle ended, there were approximately 300 dead Sioux and 25 dead soldiers

Price: Land owner James Czywczynski insists the site's historical significance adds value

The land sits on the Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation, home to the Oglala Sioux Tribe, but many of the 
descendants of the massacre victims and survivors are members of several
different Lakota tribes, said Joseph Brings Plenty, a former chairman 
of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and a traditional chief.

Brings Plenty said the tribes are not in a position to pay millions of dollars for the land.

Although tribal members are not 
opposed to development that would preserve, beautify or better educate 
the public about the land and its history, they are opposed to 
commercialization, he said.

'You don't go and dance on grandma and grandpa's grave to turn a hefty dollar sign,' he said.

Tribal members and descendants have 
reached out to President Barack Obama to make the site a National 
Monument, which would better guard the site against development and 
commercialization, Brings Plenty said.

But even if an outside investor buys 
the land with intent to develop, there will be obstacles, said Craig 
Dillon, an Oglala Sioux Tribal Council member.

Past: A picture of Wounded Knee on 28 Mar 1973. It was the site of a violent clash in 1973 between a group of native activists, the American Indian Movement and US Marshals

Massacre: U.S. Military authorities awarded twenty troopers the Medial of Honor for the massacre

Frozen: 'Big Foot,' the leader of the Sioux tribe, lies frozen on the battlefield of Wounded Knee, South Dakota

The tribe could pass new laws preventing the buyer from actually building at the site.

'Whoever buys that is still going to have to deal with the tribe,' Dillon said.

'Access is going to be an issue. 
Development is going to be an issue. I'm not threatening anybody, but my
tone is be aware you have to deal with the tribe if you purchase it.'

There are nearly 2,500 national 
historic landmarks across the country, with the vast majority of them 
owned by private landowners, said Don Stevens, chief of the History and 
National Register Program in the Midwest Region for the National Park 
Service.

Remembrance: Members of the American Indian Movement stand near the Wounded Knee Massacre Monument last month to mark the 40th anniversary of the start of the 71-day occupation

Respect: American Indians on the Big Foot Memorial Ride arrive at Porcupine, S.D n 2007 to remember the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre

Gathering: A crowd gathers to mark the 30th anniversary of the American Indian Movement standoff near the gravesite at Wounded Knee, S.D

'We advocate for preservation and we 
always express concern about potential harm for their care,' Stevens 
said, adding that the NPS does not have any legal authority.

Still, a site can lose its designation
if it does not retain its physical integrity, he said. One example is 
Soldier Field in Chicago, which lost the designation when it was 
remodeled a decade ago because it changed its physical character.

As for the Wounded Knee site, Stevens said any development could potentially affect the Historic Landmark designation.

'Certainly you would hear a hue and 
cry about that type of thing,' he said. 'And certainly if we saw 
something going up, we'd express our concern, even if we don't have a 
legal jurisdiction to intercede, we'd express our concern.'
