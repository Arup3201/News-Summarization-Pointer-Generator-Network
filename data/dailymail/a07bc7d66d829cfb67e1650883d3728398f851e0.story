Lee Chapman was found by police sleeping rough in Peterborough

Inmates at a low-security prison are allowed visits from female friends and were frequently in possession of drug and mobile phones, it has been claimed

The extraordinary claims have been made by Lee Chapman, 34, who escaped from Hollesley Bay prison, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, where he was serving a triple-life sentence for arson and burglary.

Chapman had absconded from custody and robbed six homes in eleven days. He has been given a further two years to his sentence.

The prisoner had recently been moved to the low security prison, before absconding and eventually being found by police sleeping rough in Peterborough and charged with absconding.

Chapman's defence told Ipswich Crown Court that the prisoner had found it difficult to adjust to low-security prison.

On October 8 the prisoner left his room via a drainpipe and fled by bus from the prison grounds.

While making his way back to Cambridgeshire Chapman burgled six homes in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in 11 days.

Chapman stole food and also a Nintendo games console from one home.

One householder even caught Chapman in her home eating a chocolate bar from her fridge.

When the woman confronted Chapman, he apologised, 
returned a house key he had found, and fled.

Chapman was eventually 
found by police sleeping rough in Peterborough on October 29.

He told the crown court he admitted escaping from lawful custody and burglary.

Judge David Goodin jailed him for a total of two years to be added to his existing sentence.

Hollesley Bay, Suffolk, is a category D low-security prison

After the case a Prison Service spokeswoman denied that there were drugs, mobiles and women in Hollesley Bay jail.

She said: 'It is a criminal offence 
to be in possession of drugs or a mobile phone in prison and any 
prisoner found in possession will be referred to the police.

'We take this issue extremely 
seriously and staff work hard to keep all prohibited items out of 
prisons, using a range of robust and intelligence-led measures and work 
closely with partner agencies, including the police.

As for Chapman's claim that women had slept at the jail, she insisted: 'These claims are totally untrue.'
