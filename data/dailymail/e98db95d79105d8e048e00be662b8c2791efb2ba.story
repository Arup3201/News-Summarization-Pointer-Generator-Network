Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accuses Ukip of failing to stand up for Britain in Brussels

Ukip politicians in Brussels are failing to stand up for Britain, Nick Clegg will claim today in an attack on the party’s MEPs for being lazy and ineffective.

The Lib Dem leader will accuse Ukip MEPs of being ‘happy’ to claim generous taxpayer-funded salaries without bothering to turn up to vote.

But Ukip leader Nigel Farage branded the Deputy Prime Minister a ‘hypocrite’, because he has missed four out of five votes in the Commons.

Tensions between the Lib Dems and Ukip have grown as elections to the European Parliament loom in May.

Mr Farage has accepted a challenge from Mr Clegg to go head-to-head in a debate on Europe in the next few weeks.

But in a speech today, Mr Clegg will step up his attack on Ukip MEPs, claiming they pocket their salaries without bothering to vote on the key issues facing Britain.

Mr Clegg will say: ‘Nigel Farage and deputy leader Paul Nuttall rarely turn up to vote in the European Parliament, despite being happy to take their tax-payer-funded salaries.

‘Ukip MEPs refuse to roll up their sleeves and get down to work. Nigel Farage hasn't tabled a single amendment to EU legislation since July 2009.

‘And when they’re there, UKIP MEPs don’t stand up for British interests.

‘They regularly vote against EU laws that will create British jobs, put money back in the pocket of British consumers and protect the UK from cross-border crime and terrorism.’

Ukip abstained on an EU-US trade agreement which could benefit Britain’s economy by up to £10 billion a year, voted against moves to cut mobile phone roaming charges when travelling across Europe and opposed the European Arrest Warrant, Mr Clegg will say.

Nick Clegg is to go head to head with Ukip's Nigel Farage in two broadcast debates on the European Union in the run-up to the May 22 elections to the European Parliament.

Following negotiations between the parties and broadcasters, a radio debate will take place on LBC on March 26, hosted by Nick Ferrari, and a televised debate on BBC2 on April 2, hosted by David Dimbleby.

The fiercely pro-European Deputy Prime Minister challenged Mr Farage to a debate a fortnight ago.

The Deputy Prime Minister will also hit out at the ‘myths’ being peddled by ‘isolationists’ about the EU.

He
 will argue that seeing the benefits of the EU does not mean you have to
 be blind to its faults - calling for the ‘wasteful’ second parliament 
in Strasbourg to be scrapped.

But
 Mr Farage hit back, insisting Ukip's policy of engaging ‘sufficiently’ 
with the EU to provoke debate had proved successful - and claimed his 
voting record was more than twice as good as Mr Clegg's at Westminster.

‘Our
 objective as MEPs is not to keep voting endlessly for more EU 
legislation and to take power away from Westminster,’ he told BBC Radio 
4's Today.

Mr Farage went on: ‘Our view in 15 years has been that we engage sufficiently here and we use that information to get a debate going back in the United Kingdom.

‘It seems to me, given the debate we are now having on the European Union, that the Ukip policy has been pretty successful.’

Defending his and Mr Nuttall's record, he said: ‘Both our voting records are about 50% but we are leader and deputy leader of a national party in the United Kingdom.

‘Nick Clegg himself, who actually lives in London, has only himself voted in 22% of votes in this Parliament.

‘I am the president of a group in the European Parliament. We have put down hundreds of amendments since 2009 so factually Nick Clegg is quite wrong.’

He said: ‘I am sorry Mr Clegg, but I don't think more legislation, more power to the institutions of Brussels, is good for British jobs or good for the British economy. I think we would be far better off making our own laws.’
