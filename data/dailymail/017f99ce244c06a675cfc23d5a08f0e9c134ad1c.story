A 15-year-old boy is believed to have drowned in a river while a woman died after being pulled from the sea as the heatwave water death toll rose to 15.

The teenager was airlifted to hospital after being rescued from the water at a country park in Northern Ireland yesterday but he later died.

The tragedies happened after four people drowned while swimming in rivers, lakes and quarries on Tuesday, which was the deadliest day since the heatwave began.

Double tragedy: Two people cool off at Bawsey Pits, near King's Lynn, Norfolk, despite no swimming warnings the day after a 41-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy drowned there in separate incidents

Warning: A man and a boy died at Bawsey Pits, near King's Lynn, despite signs telling people it is dangerous to get into the water

Police were called to Roe Valley Country Park near Limavady in County Londonderry, yesterday afternoon after the teenage boy got into difficulties in the water.

A Police Service of Northern Ireland spokesman said: 'The teenager is believed to have drowned after falling into the River Roe.'

This afternoon a 69-year-old woman died after being dragged out of the water behind the Beachcomber on Roman Bank 
in Skegness, Lincolnshire.

It is thought that the woman may have suffered a medical episode while in the water.

On Tuesday, a man and a 16-year-old boy died in separate incidents at Bawsey Pits, near King's Lynn, Norfolk.

Ryan Pettengell, 41, drowned after 
becoming tangled in reeds 6ft underwater while 16-year-old Umar Balogun, from east London, died after getting into difficulties in a separate lake.

It is understood Ryan attempted to swim to an island in the lakes with a broken arm.

Despite dozens of warning signs 
telling people not to get into the water because it is dangerous, more 
than 30 people still went for a swim the day after the double tragedy.

Separately, a 40-year-old woman died while swimming off the coast at Looe, Cornwall on Tuesday after she suffered an apparent medical episode.

The woman, from Saltash, Cornwall was
pulled from the water by an off-duty policeman and airlifted to 
Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, but later declared dead.

Also on Tuesday, a 21-year-old man from Shropshire drowned
in a river near Chirk, North Wales.

With the heatwave set to continue for another week, there are fears the death toll will rise higher still over the weekend.

A four-week old baby was yesterday rushed to hospital after suffering severe sunburn.

The child was seen by staff at a specialist burns unit at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, East Sussex.

A hospital spokesperson said: 'The current hot weather has led to a worrying number of admissions to our specialist burns unity.

'We have seen ten children and babies with sun burn in the past four weeks, six of whom needed specialist treatment.

Meanwhile, Jordon Graham, 21, is thought to have plunged to his death while sunbathing on the roof of a friend’s third-storey flat in Consett, County Durham on Tuesday.

And a Royal Mail postman died and collapsed of a heart attack on his round during the hot weather on Monday.

Daredevils who jumped into a canal in Blackburn, Lancashire, to cool off were condemned by police yesterday.

A group, aged mostly in their early 20s, jumped into the Leeds and Liverpool Canal as temperatures soared to 27C.

Police said the swimmers were ‘daft’ and warned that the action posed ‘obvious’ dangers.

Blackburn Police Inspector Abid Khan said: 'It is very dangerous. The water isn’t clear and you often can’t see what’s in there, among the many other risks.

'No police officer wants to tell a family their loved one has been killed doing something silly. I know it might look very enticing but go to a proper pool where there are rescue facilities.'

And a spokesman for Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'It is very unsafe and we don’t say that just to take a nanny state stance.Going from experience, we have been put in a position where we have to attempt to rescue people from canals but often we only succeed in recovering a body.

'Because the effects of cold water can be so sudden, a rescue is not possible. There is a very real risk of injury and death.'

Up to 760 people have lost their lives as a result of Britain's blistering heatwave with the figures set to rise, experts warn.

A heatwave death toll has been calculated by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) for The Times. Researchers used temperature data supplied by the Met Office and compared the figures with previous studies conducted on deaths during heatwaves in Britain.

They found that between 540 and 760 people will have perished in England alone during the first nine days of the heatwave and warn the figures could easily double in the coming days.
