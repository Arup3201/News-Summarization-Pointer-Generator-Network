A Cardiff University rugby team was banned from a P&O ferry for 'appalling' behaviour during which a trainee medic allegedly urinated on a family dining table.

A rugby team from the university School of Medicine was on a rugby tour to Amsterdam when the incident was alleged to have taken place on a ferry from Dover. 

P&O confirmed the team were barred from the return journey after their behaviour on the outbound trip.

One anonymous student told university newspaper Gair Rhydd: 'I was told that one rugby player got so drunk they urinated in someone's food.' 

Company spokesman Brian Rees said: 'It relates to a group who travelled with us from Dover to Calais in mid February. 

'Unfortunately behaviour was such that we had to explain that we would not offer them the return journey so they made other arrangements to get back. 

'The behaviour was so appalling we didn't have a moment's hesitation in banning them from coming back with us.' 

A Cardiff University spokesperson said the university had been made aware of an incident involving Cardiff Medics Rugby Team. However, no formal complaints have been made to the university. 

Cardiff University have confirmed they are investigating the incident after allegations of bad behaviour 

The spokesperson added: 'The alleged behaviour is certainly not the behaviour we expect of our students. As far as we have been able to establish we have not received a formal complaint. 

'However, on receiving this information, we are investigating the exact circumstances and will need to consider what action will need to be taken.' 

Elliot Howells, Cardiff Students' Union President, said: 'We are aware of an incident involving the Medics Rugby Team and are investigating this concurrently with Cardiff University. 

'Should any individuals be found to be responsible, appropriate action will be taken. This type of behaviour is not condoned by the Students' Union and we convey this message strongly to sports teams during their yearly induction sessions.' 

Cardiff Medics has both a first and second XV. It is not clear which team was involved in the incident.
