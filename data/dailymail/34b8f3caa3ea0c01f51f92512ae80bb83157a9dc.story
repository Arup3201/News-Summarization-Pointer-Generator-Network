It took six hours longer than they expected, but the remaining three of four San Antonio women imprisoned for sexually assaulting two girls in 1994 were freed Monday night and finally able to embrace their loved ones.

Elizabeth Ramirez, Kristie Mayhugh and Cassandra Rivera were released on their own recognizance after a judge decided to recommend that an appeals court vacate their 1998 convictions as tainted by faulty witness testimony.

The three emerged from the Bexar County 
Jail in San Antonio shortly after 8 p.m. Monday, clasping their hands in
one another's and holding them high as tearful family and friends 
surged toward them.

Each was dressed in fresh, new clothes brought to 
them in advance by their families.

Sweet relief: Kristie Mayhugh waves from a car after her release Monday after 15 years in a San Antonio, Texas prison. The women were released after a judge deemed 1998 witness testimony faulty

Faulty testimony: The three were convicted with Anna Vasquez in 1998 of assaulting two girls aged 7 and 9, in 1994. The girls testified that the women held them by their wrists and ankles, attacked them and threatened to kill them

Rivera was introduced to her 
granddaughter for the first time. ‘I'm your grandma. I'm your grandma, 
baby. You're beautiful!’ she said with a gasp.

They
walked past reporters without comment before they climbed into a 
minivan. As they left, family members repeated over and over to them, ‘I
love you. I love you.’

Before
the women emerged, Gloria Herrera was anxious about reuniting with her 
daughter, Ramirez. ‘I've seen her, but I haven't held her,’ she said.

The women have not been exonerated formally, but Bexar County prosecutors have said they do not intend to retry them if the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals vacates the convictions.

The three and their attorneys were expected to describe their next steps in their pursuit of exoneration later this week. However, prosecutors do not agree with Mike Ware, one of the attorneys for the women, that they should be declared formally innocent - a distinction that would allow them to collect money Texas pays to the wrongfully imprisoned.

The women's release was delayed for about six hours by paperwork issues with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.

The three were convicted with Anna Vasquez in 1998 of assaulting two of Ramirez's nieces, ages 7 and 9, in successive attacks during a week in 1994. The girls testified that the women held them by their wrists and ankles, attacked them and threatened to kill them.

Darker days: Ramirez (left) was given a 37-year prison sentence for the role prosecutors say she played in the 1994 crime. Rivera (right) and Mayhugh (below) received 15-year sentences

Ramirez was given a 37-year prison sentence. Mayhugh, Vasquez and Rivera were given 15-year sentences. Vasquez had already been paroled.

Their case came to the attention of attorneys affiliated with the non-profit Innocence Project of Texas more than a decade after the women were imprisoned. The group investigates potential wrongful conviction cases and Ware, who has worked on the case for two years, filed petitions on the women's behalf last month with the state appeals court.

They were convicted based on an expert's testimony that a vaginal injury sustained by the 9-year-old girl could have been caused by an assault. According to a petition filed by Ware, Dr. Nancy Kellogg testified that the injury in question happened around the time of the alleged assaults.

But her conclusions have since been discredited by current findings on science, attorneys have said. Kellogg declined an interview request from The Associated Press last week.

Texas has passed several laws to add new safeguards for eyewitness identification, DNA testing and other issues in response to a rash of wrongful-conviction cases.

Ware used one law passed this year to allow defendants to file appeals based on potential misuse of 'junk science' - something criminal justice advocates have targeted as a frequent cause of wrongful convictions.

‘It's a breath of fresh air,’ Vasquez told reporters after Ware announced earlier Monday that they would be released. ‘It's an awesome feeling. It's like a dream come true.’

Herrera said she and her daughter hadn't decided what they would do when Ramirez went free - other than she knew Ramirez wanted a pizza.

‘In the beginning there was no hope but this day has finally arrived,’ Herrera said. ‘I pray that this doesn't happen to anybody else.’
