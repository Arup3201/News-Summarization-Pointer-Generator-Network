A promising student has been jailed for stalking his ex-girlfriend and threatening to drown her in a lake after she broke up with him.

Adam Love bombarded aspiring doctor Gabrielle Onions with 200 phone calls, 400 text messages and 74 emails in just 14 hours after she told him their relationship was over.

When the 26-year-old's pleas were ignored, he started to send his ex increasingly threatening messages, a court heard.

In one text, Love told Miss Onions, 21, he would throw her into a lake and watch her drown while he had sex with another woman.

The defendant, who was once named his college's 'student of the year', blamed his actions on steroids he was taking to improve his performance as an amateur bodybuilder.

He met Miss Onions when the pair were both studying at the University of Wolverhampton, but she broke up with him because he was 'too controlling'.

Love, from Tipton in the West Midlands, was yesterday sentenced to eight months in prison after pleading guilty to harassment at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

'What you did was totally unacceptable,' said recorder Leo Pyle. 'You dominated her life and when she ended your relationship, you started the campaign of harassment in which you threatened her life.

'You subject Miss Onions to a barrage of threats and taunts and she had been beside herself with fear.'

Love was also given an indefinite restraining order which bans him form contacting Miss Onions or going near her home in Wednesfield.

Gerard Brady, defending, said that Love had been taking steroids around the time of the incidents.

'They led to him behave in an appalling way,' he said. 'It was persistent behaviour but no violence was ever used.

'He knows what he did had a devastating effect on his victim.'

Speaking after the case, Miss Onions said that the ordeal had jeopardised her medical studies, and criticised the 'lenient' sentence.

'I was living in fear and I still am,' he said. 'He became more aggressive and more controlling. I want to try and put this behind me and move on.

'I don't think eight months is enough for the stress and emotional strain it has put on me. He blamed steroid use in court but he was aggressive when he wasn't on them.

'It had a huge impact on my studies. I am in my last year now - it couldn't have come at a worse time.'
