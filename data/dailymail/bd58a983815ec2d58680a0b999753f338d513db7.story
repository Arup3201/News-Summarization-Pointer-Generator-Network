Gregory Douglas, 40, was arrested for using the counterfeit notes

State police say a western Pennsylvania man has been charged with passing counterfeit $20 bills at a yard sale, which was run by a bank teller.

Trooper Terry Geibel says the teller is trained to know the look and feel of real money. 

Gregory Douglas, 40, of Kittanning has been charged with forgery, a felony, and theft by deception, a misdemeanor, The (Kittanning) Leader-Times reported. 

He remained jailed on Friday on previous counterfeiting and other charges. There's no attorney listed for him in court records.

Amy Miller, the teller at Citizens Bank in Kittanning, tells the newspaper the bills weren't printed on 'money paper. Compared to the other twenties in my bag, it was really white.'

The trooper says the money was printed on resume paper.
