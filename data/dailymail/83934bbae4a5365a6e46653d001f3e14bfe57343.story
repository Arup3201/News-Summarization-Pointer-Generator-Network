A welder has received a five-figure compensation pay-out after his neck was sliced open with an angle-grinder as he cut steel for his employer.

Alan Bailey, 48, from Birmingham, West Midlands, had to undergo emergency surgery to stitch up the 12-inch wound after the machine slashed his throat in August 2011.

Despite wearing full protective gear at the time, Mr Bailey was 'millimetres from dying' when the machine 'kicked back against a piece of steel' and cut close to his major veins and arteries.

Alan Bailey, 48, from Birmingham, West Midlands, spent nine weeks recovering from his injuries and had to be cared for by his wife Tracy (pictured together above) after the angle-grinder slashed through his neck in 2011

The welder was 'millimetres from dying' after an angle-grinder he was using to cut steel for his employers 'kicked back' and slashed through his neck, close to his main arteries. He had been wearing protective gear

The father-of-three had to undergo emergency surgery and needed 17 staples to hold the deep wound together

The father-of-three, who was treated at Russells Hall Hospital, West Midlands, was left needing 17 staples to hold the deep wound in his neck together and suffered psychological issues as a result.

He has now won a five-figure settlement from his employer Pressvess Ltd, after the firm admitted liability for the incident.

Mr Bailey said: 'I couldn't believe it when the accident happened. I was wearing full protective gear when the machine sliced my neck

'I was shell-shocked and I grabbed my neck to try to stem the bleeding.

'I was in complete agony and a friend took me to hospital where I had emergency surgery to clear debris from the wound and repair the muscles which had been severed.

'The doctors told me I was literally millimetres from having a fatal injury which was horrifying to hear.'

Mr Bailey spent nine weeks recovering from the incident and had to be cared for by his wife Tracy.

Mr Bailey has  physically recovered from his injuries but suffers from psychological issues since the ordeal

He said: 'I needed help with every part of my daily routine which was horrific - I couldn't do anything around the house or even wash and dress without the help of my wife and three boys. 

'It was an incredibly difficult period of my life.

Mrs Bailey said the ordeal had been a 'tough time' for the family.

She said: 'I'm so glad I still have a husband and my boys still have their father.

'It was such a horrific accident and it has been a really tough time for Alan and the family.

Mr Bailey, 48, said he just wants to 'look to the future now' after receiving the five-figure compensation

'I am just so glad he has recovered from it and we still have him with us.'

Katy Bailey, from law firm Irwin Mitchell, who represented Mr Bailey, said: 'This is a horrific case which highlights the terrible consequences which can emerge as a result of health and safety failings in the workplace.

'While we are delighted to have helped Alan get the support he needed following the problems he faced, it is important that a case like this is held up as an example as to why employers need to following health and safety legislation and ensure they are doing everything they can to protect their staff.

'Too many people are injured as a result of failings which could and should be avoided and it is vital lessons are learned to ensure the same problems are never repeated in the future.'

Mr Bailey said he was relieved the incident was behind him and said he just wanted 'to look to the future now'.

He said: 'Knowing that we have secured this settlement is a massive relief and a weight off my shoulders. 

'I'm hopeful that this means I will now be able to move on with my life and put what I've been through behind me.'

Now having recovered fully from his injuries, Mr Bailey continues to work for Pressvess Ltd. 

A spokesman for the stainless steel fabrication business said: 'Pressvess takes its responsibility for health and safety very seriously and expects all employees to do the same.

'Following a full and thorough accident investigation improvements have since been made.

'Alan returned to work following his recovery and continues to be a valued member of staff at Pressvess.'
