Justin Robert Muoio is accused of pimping out a pregnant woman, 23, on Craigslist for $200 a time

A man who allegedly pimped out a pregnant women to 'fetish' clients on Craigslist for $200 a time has been charged with false imprisonment.

Justin Robert Muoio, 32, is accused of posting adverts for the woman on Craigslist as a 'pregnant prostitute' for 'fetish clientele'.

The 23-year-old woman, who says she was forced to have sex with strangers for two months of her pregnancy in 2013, is also alleged to have been kept inside Muoio's apartment on the outskirts of Miami. 

Muoio was arrested in August 2014 after a 'heated altercation' with the woman, who then tried to leave the apartment but was locked in.

She was trapped inside for 90 minutes until Muoio's mother Louise Henig-Muoio, 65, went outside briefly, the Miami Herald reported. 

But the woman later told Sergeant Misael Reyes that Muoio had 'physically forced her' to meet men for sex since 2009 through a company called VIP Escort Services.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, would meet eight to 10 men a day, six days a week, according to a search warrant.

The warrant also stated that the woman started living with Muoio and his mother, with the man taking the money she earned and 'restricting where she could go and who she could talk to'.

Investigators seized two phones Muoio is accused of using to take photos and post adverts on Craigslist, before communicating with clients.

Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said: 'Human trafficking cases, or modern day slavery, involve unspeakable and unthinkable acts of inhumanity.

'This reality sinks deeper with each new victim we rescue.'

Muoio is on house arrest awaiting trial on charges of battery and false imprisonment. He denies the allegations. 

Ms Muoio has also been charged with false imprisonment.
