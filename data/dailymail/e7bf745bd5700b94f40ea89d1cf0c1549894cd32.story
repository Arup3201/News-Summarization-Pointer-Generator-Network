A  giant turnip weighing a whopping 33lbs and measuring 4ft long across has been grown in China's Yunnan Province.

The monster vegetable, which weighs more than a three-year-old child, is so big it had been nicknamed the 'fat little girl' in the village where it was grown, The People's Daily Online reported.

Mr Li claimed the specimen, which had been grown naturally without the help of any fertilizers, had become a big attraction  and pictures of it have even gone viral.

It is not the first time these outsized vegetables have turned up in China but usually they are grown by farmers using commercial fertilizers.

Mr Li, from Eshan in Yunnan, said he shocked with mammoth turnip which at 4ft (1.2m) long was the length of his flower bed.

He explained he had just picked up some ordinary seeds from the local market and had not used any fertilizer but was careful to water it everyday.

After pictures of it were posted online, one commenter wrote: 'Radish, have you grown so big to become the King of Radish?'

Earlier this year another giant vegetable was found growing in China's Guangdong province in a Shantou village. This radish was also 33lbs in weight and measured 2ft (60cm) in length.

When asked about his secret to growing his prized specimens the farmer, Mr Chen, said:  'The most important elements for big radish is good quality fertilizer, good soil and not to grow them too tightly together and plenty of water.'

Many people like to buy radish to take home during the Chinese Spring Festival as the Mandarin pronunciation of the nickname of this vegetable is 'Cai Tou' which sounds like 'Good Start'. 

The worlds's heaviest turnip was a Mammoth Purple Top and weighed 17.7 kg (39 lbs 3 oz).

It was grown by Scott and Mardie Robb from the US who presented it the Alaska State Fair in 2004.
