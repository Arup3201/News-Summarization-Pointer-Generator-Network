A Mississippi man captured his city's attention and terrified pet owners when he posted a sign in his front yard threatening to slay any stray cat he found.

'If you have a cat, keep it in your yard or I will kill it,' the sign promised.

The man, who would identify himself to reporters only as Kevin, says the sign drew so much attention he's in trouble with the Hernando mayor's office.

'If you have a cat, keep it in your yard or I will kill it,' promises this Mississippi yard sign

'Next time, I'll put something a little nice,' he told WMC.

Kevin painted the sign enraged after a cat that regularly passed through his yard woke him up at 5 a.m. yet again by causing his dog to bark and scratch at the blinds.

On that day, he said he hadn't had his coffee yet and had 'had it.'

But now he's getting death threats from cat owners.

And the mayor's office immediately dispatched an animal control officer to deal with the situation and make sure that any wandering cats would only be corralled not killed.

Kevin told reporters he would never actually murder a feline and that the sign was painted in the heat of the moment without thinking.

But his neighbors remain unsettled, especially Hannah Ward who owns the cat that offended him to begin with.

'For a sign like that, I don't know. It's a little much," she said. 'If something happened to my cat, I don't know
 what I would do.'

The sign's painter, Kevin, said he made it in a fit of rage after neighbor Hannah Ward's roaming cat repeatedly woke him up at 5 a.m. by wandering into his yard and causing his dogs to bark

She said her cat, T.J., was a rescue cat with a sweet personality and a penchant for wandering.

The Ward's have not seen the cat since Wednesday.

Kevin said their concern just proves his sign worked.

'It took about 20 minutes and I knew who it was,' he said.

Animal control has since asked him to remove the sign.

'It's illegal. It's animal cruelty, and we are watching him and keeping an eye on the general area,' said Hernando Animal Control official Jacob Hisaw.

While Hisaw may not agree with sign's message, there is no proof Kevin broke any laws.
