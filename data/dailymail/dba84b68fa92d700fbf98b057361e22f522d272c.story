Just three months after Microsoft bought Minecraft firm Mojang, the software giant has released the game on its own range of Windows Phone devices. 

Minecraft: Pocket Edition is available now for £4.99 for handsets and tablets running Windows Phone 8.1.

It is the first time the game has been available for the platform, and means it can now be played on all the major phone operating systems.

Minecraft founder Markus Persson sold the hugely-popular game to Microsoft in September, in a deal that was said to be worth $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion).

The Windows Phone version of the game includes all of Minecraft’s mobile features, including Survival mode, Creative mode and multiplayer features when being used on local Wi-Fi networks. 

It also includes new biomes, caves, mobs and villages.

After the September deal was finalised, Mr Persson left the company. In a statement released at the time, Mr Persson said: 'I'm leaving Mojang. 

Minecraft was created in 2009. 

At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.'

They
 can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests 
and caves.

Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of 
the landscape.

Players are 
given blocks and tools to build towns and cities.

The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available.

'A relatively long time ago, I decided to step down from Minecraft development.

'Jens [Bergensten] was the perfect person to take over leading it, and I wanted to try to do new things.

'I was at home with a bad cold a couple of weeks ago when the internet exploded with hate against me over some kind of EULA situation that I had nothing to do with. I was confused. I didn’t understand. I tweeted this in frustration.

'I’m not an entrepreneur. I’m not a CEO. I’m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter.

'As soon as this deal is finalised, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments.

'Considering the public image of me already is a bit skewed, I don’t expect to get away from negative comments by doing this, but at least now I won’t feel a responsibility to read them.

'I’m aware this goes against a lot of what I’ve said in public. I have no good response to that.

'I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can’t be responsible for something this big.

'In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now. In a much bigger sense, it’s belonged to all of you for a long time, and that will never change. It’s not about the money. It’s about my sanity.'

Minecraft is also available on PCs and for Xbox Live on the Xbox 360, and in the last two years it has become the top online game for the Microsoft console.  

Mr Persson created Minecraft in 2009 before releasing it widely in November 2011.

At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.' They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves. 

Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape. 

Players
 are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player 
progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different
 materials. 

In 2012, Persson criticised Windows 8 and 
Microsoft for trying to 'ruin the PC as an open platform', he also 
separately said his price to ‘endorse cr*p’ was $2 billion dollars, 
which may explain the pricing of the deal.

In 2012, founder Markus Persson, who tweets under the handle @notch, openly criticised Microsoft's Windows 8 software (pictured). He also said 'Got an email from Microsoft, wanting to help 'certify' Minecraft for Windows 8. I told them to stop trying to ruin the PC as an open platform'

More than 16,645,000 people have bought the game, so far, and it is an online phenomenon.

There are even YouTube channels dedicated to showing people how to play the game, which in same cases make the owners enough money in advertising to quit their jobs.

Microsoft bought Nokia's phone business for $7.3 billion in April and is also seeking to boost Microsoft's Windows Phone system, which has gained little traction against Apple's iPhones and Google's Android system.

Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has made mobile phones and Internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses - Windows and Office software installed on desktops - slow down or decline.  

Persson also separately tweeted that his price to ‘endorse cr*p’ was $2 billion dollars, which may explain the pricing of the deal. The deal exceeds the amount Facebook paid for virtual reality headset firm which creates Oculus Rift
