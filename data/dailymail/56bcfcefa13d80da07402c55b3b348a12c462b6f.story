Juventus head coach Max Allegri claims that fatigue is behind Paul Pogba's recent dip in form and admits the midfielder must learn to pace himself throughout matches.

The former Manchester United man is widely considered one of the best young players in Europe and has excelled for Juve since joining the club in 2012.

After a brilliant first half of the season the France international has suffered a lull in performances and again far from his best as the Italian champions succumbed to a 2-1 Coppa ltalia defeat by Fiorentina.

And former AC Milan boss Allegri claims the 21-year-old is just suffering from burnout and admits the midfielder must learn to control games without overexerting himself.

'Any player over 40-50 games per season will have moments of fatigue, let alone a 21-year-old who has a lot to learn on how to control games and pace himself throughout 90 minutes,' the coach told reporters.

'I always tell him technique is not enough, he needs to put in a certain type of performance. Youngsters are going to have peaks and troughs, as Alvaro Morata did, on their way to maturity.'
