For 25 years, Pixar has created the likes of Toy Story, Wreck It Ralph and Monster's University using a custom-built software - and soon this program will be available for everyone.

Individual licences for the RenderMan software typically cost $500 (£300) but from August, amateur animators can get hold of the non-commercial version of the program for free.

Anyone interested in downloading the software can register their interest via Pixar’s RenderMan site.

The RenderMan software typically costs $495 (£295) and has been used by Pixar to render animations in Toy Story 3 (pictured), Wreck It Ralph and Star Wars. From August, amateur animators can get hold of the non-commercial version of the program for free

Rendering is used in 3D graphics to add the final appearance to computer models and animation.

It is also used in video games and simulators.

The software uses a combination of light physics and mathematics to plot how the final image will look to make them as realistic as possible.

For
 movie animations, several images, also known as frames, are rendered, 
and stitched together in a program such as RenderMan.

Many 3D image 
editing programs have these features, but RenderMan is considered one of the best.

RenderMan is a visual effects program used to create 3D animations and graphics. 

As well as Pixar’s own releases, the technology has been used to create effects seen in Thor, Interview With A Vampire, Jurassic Park and James Bond film, SkyFall.

The Californian firm, which was set up by Steve Jobs in 1986 after he bought George Lucas’ Computer Graphic Division, said in a statement: ‘Given the continually falling price of computing, trends point to studios and individual artists needing more and more rendering capacity.

'Reducing the cost of RenderMan makes it more cost effective to expand capacity and generate higher quality pixels. 

Students, freelancers and developers can register their interest to receive the software via Pixar's RenderMan site.

Pixar is expected to release the latest version of RenderMan, used to create the aliens in Toy Story (pictured) at a computer graphics show in August

‘Pixar has established a new price point to specifically encourage accessibility and remove barriers to growth, all as part of a long-term rendering strategy that will channel new rendering technologies from Disney and Pixar into the production industry.’

According to the site’s terms, non-commercial use is restricted to education, research and development of the software.

This means any renderings made using the software can be published, but can’t be used for profit.

Pixar is expected to release the latest version of RenderMan, which falls under the new pricing, at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics trade show in Vancouver, in August.

Rendering is used in 3D graphics to add the final appearance to computer models and animation.

It is also used in video games and simulators.

For movie animations, several images, also known as frames, are rendered, and stitched together in a program such as RenderMan, and most 3D image editing programs now have these features.
