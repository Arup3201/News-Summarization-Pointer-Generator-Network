A man allegedly armed with an axe and molotov cocktails has been arrested after driving his car into bollards at a business park next to Canberra airport.

An Australian Federal Police officer was injured, with one witness saying the arrested man had thrown petrol at the officer.

The police officer received medical attention from ambulance officers at the Brindabella Business Park on Friday afternoon.

Before his arrest, the accused man had driven his car into bollards near one of the businesses at the park, police say.

'He is being assessed as possibly suffering from mental health issues,' ACT police said in a statement.

Police dismissed reports it was a terrorism-related incident.

A source said the man was a disgruntled former employee of one of the businesses at the park.

The business park returned to normal operations after the evacuation, which went smoothly and without incident, a spokeswoman from the business park said.
