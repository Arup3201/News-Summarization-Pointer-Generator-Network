Since the Toulon Tournament was launched in 1967, a raft of top class players have progressed from games in small stadiums to become world stars.

Whether the youngsters at this year's edition can progress like the greats who have gone before them remains to be seen but one thing is certain, whichever nation lifts the trophy on June 1 will have a squad full of quality.

With England beginning their campaign against Qatar this afternoon, Sportsmail have cast an eye over the other competing nations and selected a soon-to-be-famous five.

Highly-rated: Chelsea value Lucas Piazon (right, on loan at Vitesse) and he could shine in Toulon for Brazil

Country: Brazil Age: 20 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward

Piazon
 has barely been seen at Stamford Bridge over the past 18 months since 
making his sole Barclays Premier League appearance against Aston Villa 
but do not dispute how highly Chelsea value him.

He is under contract 
until 2017 and has been away gaining experience, first with Malaga and 
then last season at Vitesse Arnhem, for whom he scored 11 times in 29 
appearances. Versatile and gifted, he can play in a number of attacking 
positions and is an exciting prospect. Other Brazilians to note are 
Marquinhos of Paris Saint-Germain and Vasco de Gama striker Thalles.

Available: Contract discussions between PSG and Rabiot (right) have stalled, alerting Arsenal

Country: France Age: 19 Club: Paris Saint-Germain Position: Midfield 

It
 has been noted by clubs in the Barclays Premier League, most notably 
Arsenal, that Rabiot is currently at loggerheads with Paris St Germain 
over a new contract and a clutch of admirers would be willing to pounce 
if given the chance. Technically gifted and energetic, Rabiot’s 
potential at PSG was spotted by former manager Carlo Ancelotti, who 
promoted him to the senior squad in 2012. Spent the second half of last 
season at Toulouse but made more than enough appearances to pick up his 
second Ligue 1 medal.

Gold reserve: Joao Teixeira is a star for Liverpool's second team and will be the 'technician' for Portugal

Country: Portugal Age: 21 Club: Liverpool Position: Midfield 

Hailed
 by Brendan Rodgers as 'the outstanding performer in our reserves' in 
the New Year, Teixeira was promptly given his debut in the Barclays 
Premier League by the Liverpool manager when coming on as a substitute 
in 3-2 win over Fulham.

Liverpool bought him for £800,000 after he had 
starred for Sporting Lisbon during their 3-0 victory at Anfield in the 
2011 NextGen Series. Fits the description of being a 'technician' and 
shows great poise in possession. Will be a key man for Portugal, who 
opened their campaign with a 2-0 win over Mexico on Wednesday.

International: Club Brugge's Nicolas Castillo has already made his full international debut for Chile

Country: Chile Age: 21 Club: FC Brugge Position: Striker 

Football
 is flourishing in Chile and Castillo has already made his way into 
European football. Enjoyed a successful time at the Under-20 World Cup 
last summer, when he scored three times including a penalty against 
England in a 1-1 draw in Antalya, and his sharpness of mind and clinical
 finishing has secured him a first senior cap, too. Started Chile’s 
opening game against France in Toulon but was powerless to prevent the 
hosts running out 3-0 winners.

Speed: Jean-Christophe Bahebeck (left) is known in France for his explosive pace

Country: France Age: 21 Club: Paris Saint-Germain Position: Striker    

Jean-Pierre
 Papin, Thierry Henry and Djibril Cisse are some of the French players 
who have finished the Toulon Tournament with the award for top 
goalscorer and Bahebeck has made the perfect start to this year's 
competition, scoring twice in the 3-0 win over Chile.

He was a key part 
in the France side that won last year’s Under-20 World Cup and while he 
has spent time away from PSG in the last two seasons, with loans to 
Troyes and Valenciennes, Bahebeck is touted in France as having a big 
future. He can also operate with speed on the wing.
