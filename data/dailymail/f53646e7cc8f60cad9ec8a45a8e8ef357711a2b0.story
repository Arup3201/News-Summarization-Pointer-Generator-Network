Brendan Rodgers and the Liverpool fans are partly to blame for Luis Suarez’s latest bite. 

By throwing his arms around Suarez last summer, Rodgers got the best out of the player, but he also fed his ego.

The fans forgot the Ivanovic bite, they swept away memories of Suarez openly saying he wanted to leave Liverpool, and they chose to ignore the fact that Suarez downed tools on his return to Melwood after the Confederations Cup. Suarez was allowed to get away with lots of bad stuff, and was treated as a legend, simply because he scored lots of goals.

Just a quick check back through the history books confirms that you have to do a little bit more than finish second to be a Liverpool legend. And it may be the lack of title success in the modern era that has lowered standards at Anfield, but those fans should ask more of their players on and off the pitch.

The irony is that the points dropped in the games Suarez missed because of suspension at the start of last season cost Liverpool the title. That ban came back to bite Liverpool on the shoulder.

The season of adulation Suarez enjoyed gave him God-like status in his own mind coming into the World Cup. The crisis when he was injured fed the ego even more, and the desperation to have him back after Uruguay lost to Costa Rica gave Suarez a head the size of South America.

Two goals and a victory later, Suarez was the self-appointed King of the World Cup. He taunted the English and punished us all - in his world. 

And then, just when it looked like Uruguay were going out of the tournament, frustration set in and Suarez’s 'God status' was threatened. He lashed out, he regressed to childhood and bit an opponent. Again.

What would Bill Shankly have said about that bite?

Well he probably wouldn’t have said anything because I suspect he would have sent Suarez packing after the bite on Ivanovic last year, described by Brendan Rodgers as an 'unfortunate incident.'

When it comes to finding the right words, there are few from the footballing world who get close to matching the articulation of Shankly the great, so Rodgers has a tough act to follow. The Liverpool boss has shown admirable deference to Shankly, and made attempts to follow his lead.

The short-termism shown by Rodgers in his treatment of Suarez has taken Liverpool back into the Champions League, but it’s also damaged the reputation of this special club. Shankly wouldn’t have stood for that. The great man once tore into Tommy Smith for wearing a bandage at training, so you can only imagine what he would have thought of a Liverpool player biting an opponent.

Back in December, Brendan Rodgers made Luis Suarez captain of Liverpool for their Premier League game at Tottenham.

The manager explained the decision by saying he wanted: '…someone who could represent me and the club.'

Stand by your man: Suarez was brought to Anfield by Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish

That is surely no longer the case.

Remember when Suarez made Kenny Dalglish look a fool over the Evra handshake? If a player thinks it’s acceptable to do that to a legend like Dalglish, he’s not fit to represent the club. Liverpool fans have forgiven Suarez too many times. 

They should now sell him, and trust their manager to spend the money wisely.

Liverpool Football Club has always held its head up high. But you can only hang that head in shame when one of your players has a habit of biting opponents. Time to let Luis Suarez walk on through his storm, and not damage the great name of Liverpool anymore.
