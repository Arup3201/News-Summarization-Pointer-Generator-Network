A woman who was so embarrassed by her weight she wore Bridget Jones control pants for eight years has managed to shed a third of her body weight - and finally throw them away for good.

Jo Tinsley, 29, was so embarrassed by her size that she even wore spanx tights under her pyjamas in a desperate bid to give her a more shapely silhouette.

But after embarking on a strict diet, Jo has shed an impressive four stone,
 shrinking from a size 16 to a size eight - and is finally confident 
enough to throw out the Bridget Jones knickers.

Jo Tinsley dropped from 12st 7lbs (left) to 8st 7lbs (right), after eight years of wearing spanx day and night

Even after almost a decade of squeezing into shape control spanx, 5ft 2in Jo, from Wrestlingworth, Beds, tipped the scales at 12st 7lb - giving her a BMI of 32, making her medically obese.

Jo said: 'I used to feel so frumpy and miserable, I'd got to a point where I was so miserable about the way I looked I was barely leaving the house.

'I discovered spanx and then I started wearing them obsessively - I wouldn't go anywhere without a pair on, hoping that it made me look a bit slimmer.

'One evening I was sitting at home in my pyjamas, and I still had my control pants on underneath, and I realised how ridiculous the situation had got.

'The only people who could see me were my parents, but I felt so disgusting that I couldn't even sit around in my own living room without feeling uncomfortable.

'I never dreamed I'd be able to lose the weight, but 18 months on, I'm thrilled that I'm finally the real me.'

Jo spent almost eight years yo-yo dieting, trying dozens of fad diets and religiously wearing her control pants, but failed to shift the pounds.

But when she noticed that a colleague had lost weight with the Cambridge Weight Plan - which initially restricts dieters to limited meals, replacing them with shakes and soups - she decided to give it a go.

Jo said: 'I'd always been unhappy with my size, and I was badly bullied at school.

'Some girls once started a rumour that I was pregnant. It was so humiliating, but I just turned to food for comfort.

'When I was 21, I went on a weekend break with my mum to Ireland, and I packed loads of clothes to go out in. But when I came to get changed, I realised how awful I looked, and I couldn't bear to go anywhere.

'My mum went out and bought some tummy-control pants for me, so I felt a bit more comfortable - and from then on, I was hooked.

'I wore them all the time, to the point where I didn't feel comfortable going anywhere without them.

'I tired every diet going to lose weight, but I could never stick at them.

Jo says starting the Cambridge diet and losing four stone has got her addicted to healthy eating and she now wants her story to inspire others to change their life

'I'd manage a few days, or a couple of weeks, and lose a few pounds, but then I'd cave in and the diet would go out of the window and the spanx would go back on.

'The worst diet I tried was a lemon, water and cayenne pepper diet that Beyonce was doing - I didn't even last a day.

'I never thought I'd manage to stick to a diet, but one of my friends from work lost loads of weight on Cambridge.

'I liked that I had a set diet every day, and I didn't have to worry about counting points or calories, so I gave it a go.

'I had a one-on-one counsellor from the diet plan too, who helped me keep going when it got tough.

'But the weight started falling off straight away - and I was hooked on healthy eating!'

A year and a half after starting the diet, Jo now weighs 8st 7lbs - and has finally thrown out the Bridget Jones pants.

She added: 'I've even inspired my dad to start the diet too - he's lost almost as much as me.

'I want to let other people out there who are struggling with their weight know that it is possible to change your life - if I can do it, anyone can.'
