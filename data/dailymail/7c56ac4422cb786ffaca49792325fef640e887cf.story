If you thought memorising irregular verbs for French tests was hell at school, then spare a thought for the young inhabitants of the Spanish island of La Gomera.

Despite protests, every primary school child on the Canary island is required to learn an archaic whistling language called Silbo, a version of which was once spoken by entire communities in the 16th and 17th century.

The language consists of just two to four vowels and four consonants and employs whistling to make all of its sounds.

Economic hardship in the 1950s put Silbo-speaking on the decline, as most Silbo ‘speakers’ were forced to move away to find an income.

By the end of the twentieth century, the whistled language was dying out.

But Silbo now has official protection as an example of ‘intangible cultural heritage’ which in part has spurred on a revival in the language.

Silbo originates from a more ancient version of the language called ‘Silbo Gomero’ and means ‘Gomeran whistling’, according to a report by Today I Found Out.

It was spoken in the Canary Islands and whistling could be heard from Gran Canaria to Tenerife  and from El Hiero to La Gomera.

The language, which was used by the native Guanche people, was spoken well before Spanish settlement but died out around the 17th century.

It is thought the Guanches originated from North Africa and brought the whistled language with them.

Today however, Silbo is a whistled 
form of Spanish. It was adopted in the 16th century after the last of 
the Guanches adapted their whistled language to Spanish.

One
 study showed that Silbo is recognised in the ‘language centre’ of the 
brain by Silbo whistlers, though regular Spanish speakers who were not 
Silbo whistlers simply recognised it as whistling.

It is thought that the whistling language of Silbo was developed as a form of long distance communication. La Gomera's landscape (pictured) consists of hills, valleys, and ravines and a whistle can travel up to two miles across such a landscape

A call for a revival in the language in recent years has been met with mixed emotions. Some locals think of Silbo as a language for peasants

As
 to why such a version of a language would originally be created at 
all, it’s thought that Silbo was developed as a form of long distance 
communication.

La Gomera’s landscape consists of hills, valleys, and ravines and a whistle can travel up to two miles across such a landscape.

When La Gomera was largely an agricultural island, crops and herds of animals like sheep would be spread out across the hills, and herders would use the language to communicate with one another across these large distances.

Silbo is not the only the whistling language. Separate languages using the mechanism of blowing air through pursed lips exists on the Greek island of Evia, in the town of Kuskoy, eastern Turkey, and in a town of the French Pyrenees

A call for a revival in the language in recent years has been met with mixed emotions. Many people thought of it as a peasant language of little use to them. 

It is now taught to young schoolchildren but there are fears that public spending cuts in Spain will affect teaching of the language at schools.
