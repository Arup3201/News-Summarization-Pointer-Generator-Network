Rory McIlroy may be known for his accuracy with a club, but even he will have to concede that one of his latest shots was a fluke.

After teeing off in Atlanta, Georgia, 25-year-old McIlroy watched in disbelief as his ball drifted to the right, hit a tree and then bounced into the pocket of a spectator.

The man was forced to stand still underneath the tree until McIlroy and a PGA TOUR official could make their way down and decide what to do next.

Rory McIlroy played an unlikely shot during the PGA TOUR Championship in Atlanta, Georgia, today after his ball landed in a spectator's pocket

McIlroy watched in disbelief as his tee shot drifted to the right of the green, hit a tree, then dropped into the pocket of a spectator standing underneath (top centre, in the red shirt)

The man waited in place until McIlroy made it over to him along with an official to decide what to do next

After placing a tee in the ground below the spectator's right pocket, where the shot had come to rest, McIlroy was allowed to drop the ball and play on without penalty.

From the rough the Northern Irishman then fired an impressive second shot on to the green and within 12 yards of the pin.

He then went on to complete a five-under-par round of 65 to keep himself in the hunt for both the TOUR Championship title and the FedEx Cup. 

Fortunately for McIlroy, golf rules state that if a ball is moved, deflected or stopped by an 'outside agent' - for example a spectator or animal - then the ball may be replaced and played without penalty

The official placed a marker underneath the spectator's right pocket, where the shot hand landed, and after McIlroy had dropped the ball back into play he took his second shot

Under the rules of golf, a player incurs a one shot penalty if a ball they played is moved, stopped or deflected either by themselves, their partner, their caddies or their equipment.

A player may continue without penalty if a ball they hit is moved, deflected or stopped by an 'outside agency', for example a spectator or animal, then it can be replaced without penalty.

If the ball is moved or lifted, then a player marks the spot where the ball landed, before dropping it back into play. 

Not to be put off the 25-year-old landed his second attempt within 12 yards of the pin, then went on to hit a round of five-under-par to keep himself in the running for the title
