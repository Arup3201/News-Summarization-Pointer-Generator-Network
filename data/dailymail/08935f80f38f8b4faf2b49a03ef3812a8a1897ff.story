After the anxiety of the first day Andy Murray settled comfortably into the US Open with a cramp-free, drama-free passage into the third round.

Under the glare the Arthur Ashe Stadium lights and in a gusting wind the former Wimbledon champion made light of a useful challenge from German qualifier Matthias Bachinger to win 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in one hour and 46 minutes.

It was a satisfactory evening all round for Murray as his first scheduled seeded opponent, powerful Spanish lefthander Fernando Verdasco, was knocked out 6-3 in the fifth set by Russian Andrey Kuznetsov, the world number 96. He and Murray have not played each other before.

Jamie Murray smashed his racket after match point when he and partner John Peers were beaten 4-6, 7-6, 7-6 by Scott Lipsky and Rajeev Ram in the first round of the men's doubles.

Murray later bounced back, though, in his mixed doubles opener as he and Casey Dellacqua fought back to beat Elina Svitolina and Florin Mergea 3-6, 6-1, 13-11.

The same could not be said of the Scot and Bachinger, who go back to the days of European junior tournaments, since when one has scaled the heights and the other carved out a journeyman’s living.

Bachinger is a decent enough player to give Murray a good workout and very decent for a world number 235 but lacked a weapon with which to hurt him.

Murray was too solid in the strong breeze on a cool evening in New York, and despite the wind his serve was considerably improved from what it was against Robin Haase, and there were no signs of the physical problems that sent him into spasm against the Dutchman.

'The start was tough in the conditions and we both struggled early on but we had some fun points in the second and third sets,' said Murray. 'It’s always special playing on this court, I’ve loved it since I first came her at 15. I struggled in my first match but I pulled up okay tonight.

'Kuznetsov is a very flat hitter and a big hitter and he’s dangerous, it will be a tough match.'

Murray has had some big nights on Arthur Ashe but in truth this was not one of them, with much attention centred elsewhere on packed Court 17, where 15 year-old American Catherine Bellis was playing.

The 2012 champion began with an ace, in contrast the double fault with which he kicked off on Monday, and from thereon put in a controlled performance with no angst-filled outbursts in any direction. His movement, always a barometer of his game’s overall health, was excellent.

Bachinger held his own until the eighth game when two break points were created. The first was saved by a 131mph ace but on the second he hit a forehand long. Murray sealed the set after 27 minutes with a 128mph ace of his own.

The Scot was cranking up his returns and that aggression brought an immediate break at the start of the second with the Bavarian, who was playing with no pressure and after winning four matches here, losing five games on the trot.

A pleasing aspect of the Murray game was his ability to lob his onrushing opponent, and he went two sets up by clinching a second break at 5-3.

The former Wimbledon champion briefly got into trouble at 2-2 in the third, when he saved three break points from 0-40 down. The German then saved six of his own in the eighth game, often with precision serving, but Murray made no mistake the next time and broke to love to seal his passage through.

An evening devoid of much incident was doubtless exactly what he wanted.
