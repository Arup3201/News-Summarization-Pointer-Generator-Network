Swansea midfielder Ki Sung-yueng wants to move a step closer to a Capital One Cup final hat-trick - and make big headlines back home in South Korea by beating Liverpool on Tuesday night.

Ki has played in the last two League Cup finals, on a winning side for Swansea in 2013 and for a losing Sunderland team while on loan at the Stadium of Light last season, and would love to make it three in a row this term.

Liverpool stand in his way in the last 16 at Anfield but Ki was part of the Swansea side which won 3-1 on Merseyside two seasons ago en route to claiming the first major trophy in the club's history.

'It was fabulous there two years ago, it was the same time of the competition in October so we are definitely looking forward to playing one of the big teams in England,' Ki said.

'I'd love to go to Wembley three years in a row if I can.

'It's going to be tough because they have some quality players but I just want to enjoy this competition and with the players here I think we have a chance.'

The 25-year-old is one of the poster boys of South Korean football having made the move to the Barclays Premier League and helping his country to the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil.

And he knows that another Swansea triumph at Anfield would send shock waves right across the globe to his football-mad homeland.

'There are more Liverpool supporters than Swansea back home in Korea as they are one of the biggest teams in England,' Ki said.

'If we win against Liverpool it's going to be big news, so we have nothing to lose and do our best.

'I think we have to put everything on this game and then we have a big chance to win.

'We don't want to waste this one because if we win we are in the quarter-final.

'If we win the cup our reputation is going up so the managers and the players are taking this competition seriously.'

Swansea manager Garry Monk played a strong side when the blue half of Merseyside were swept aside in the last round in September, Roberto Martinez's Everton beaten 3-0 at the Liberty Stadium.

And Monk is set to do the same again as he comes up against another one of his former Swansea managers in the shape of Brendan Rodgers.

Wayne Routledge and Gylfi Sigurdsson, who limped off in the second half of the league win over Leicester on Saturday evening with an ankle injury, could be rested alongside goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.

But Monk will resist the idea of mass rotation and that means centre-back Ashley Williams could play at Anfield, although the Swansea skipper admits he will not be swapping shirts with Mario Balotelli at half-time if he comes up against the Italian.

The Liverpool striker sparked controversy during Liverpool's Champions League tie with Real Madrid last week when he swapped shirts with Portuguese defender Pepe as the pair were leaving the pitch at the interval.

'If you see me swapping shirts at half-time I think you can give me a slap,' Williams said.

'Everyone's got an opinion on Balotelli. I think he's a good player and he's been difficult to play against every time I've come up against him.

'He hasn't found his feet at Liverpool yet but I'm sure it's only a matter of time because he's a top-quality player.'
