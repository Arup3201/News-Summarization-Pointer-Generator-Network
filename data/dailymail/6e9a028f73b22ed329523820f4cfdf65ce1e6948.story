Joel Tuck is devastated after two men who were arrested for burglarizing his home allegedly threw away the ashes of his daughter Whitney

A father has been left devastated after it was revealed two men who were arrested for burglarizing his home allegedly threw away the ashes of his daughter, who died 10 years ago. 

Joel Tuck arrived at his Franklin, Tennessee home on Monday to find that his back door was wide open and it's glass window had been broken. 

Two flat-screen TVs, several checkbooks and a bottle of liquor were stolen. But it was when Tuck realized a pink purse was missing that his heart dropped. 

The pink purse belonged to his daughter Whitney, who died in 2005 at the age of 19 after losing her battle with leukemia. Her ashes were kept in a box inside the purse, which had been her favorite. 

Franklin police arrested Jwyanza Weaver and Christopher Gengler in connection to the burglary. They are currently in custody.

Both men are convicted felons and Weaver was on probation at the time of his arrest, according to the Tennessean. 

According to police, the two men drove to a gas station after burglarizing the home. It was there that Gengler threw away the pink purse into a trash can.

For Tuck, who kept the purse in his room, the entire ordeal has felt like losing his daughter all over again. 

He said it will probably haunt him for the rest of his life.

'I would touch that bag and talk and different things,' he told WKRN. 'It gave me a sense of peace that she's still with me.' 

Whitney's ashes were stored inside a matte black wooden box. Also inside the purse was a second box, engraved with the name Duchess, that held the cremated remains of Whitney's puppy, who died shortly after her. 

Police searched a number of dumpsters for six hours but have still not located the pink purse. 

Chief Deborah Faulkner said the bag can be dropped off 'a police station, a fire station, or anywhere else someone will find them and call us,' no questions asked.

There is a $1,000 reward for information pertaining to the case.  

Gengler and Weaver have been charged with aggravated burglary and theft. 

As for Tuck, he said he has been left 'heartbroken' and just wants Whitney home. 

'I feel like those ashes are my last small link to my daughter.'
