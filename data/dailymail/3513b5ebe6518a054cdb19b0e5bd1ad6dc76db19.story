A law professor serving in Afghanistan has left his job at a Massachusetts university after a colleague there said it was 'shameful' to send care packages to U.S. troops.

U.S. Army Reserve Major Robert Roughsedge resigned from Suffolk University in Boston after fellow law professor Michael Avery sent an email insulting soldiers fighting overseas.

Mr Avery attacked a University effort to donate items to soldiers in what Major Roughsedge called a 'hate speech', Fox News reported.

Mr Avery wrote in the email to colleagues: 'I think it is shameful that it is perceived as legitimate to solicit in an academic institution for support for men and women who have gone overseas to kill other human beings.

'Why are we sending support to the military instead of Americans who are losing their homes, malnourished, unable to get necessary medical care, and suffering from other consequences of poverty?

'As a university community, we should debate these questions, not remain on automatic pilot in support of the war agenda.'

Mr Avery, who specialises in constitutional law, said it was 'not particularly rational in today's world' to have sympathy for American troops in a war zone.

Major Roughsedge was so upset with that sentiment he handed in his letter of resignation on Monday. The soldier told Fox 25: 'It’s basically like a five-year-old throwing a temper tantrum.

'That is not how we teach our students to rationally look at the issues.

'We want rational adult discourse and that is not something I would tolerate in my class and it is not something the school should tolerate from one of its professors.'

Major Roughsedge had been part of the adjunct faculty at Suffolk University for eight years and taught a popular course on terrorism and the law.

The university is now getting a lot of complaints from students and alumni who say Mr Avery's view does not represent that of the school.

In an 
email to Dean Camille Nelson, revealed by newspaper Hampton-North Hampton Patch, Major Roughsedge wrote: 'Professor Avery has engaged in hate speech against a class of citizens who 
ironically do not enjoy the same First Amendment rights.

'Members serving in the U.S. military 
cannot speak out on matters of politics or personal opinion if doing so would 
tarnish the reputation of the military.

'I have a moral obligation to exercise my First Amendment right of freedom of 
association and choose not to associate with Suffolk University Law School 
any more.

'This is a sad moment for me because I know that the students do not 
agree with Professor Avery and I truly enjoy teaching. However, I must go else I 
am tarnished by the association.

'The only way for the students and alumnae to 
stop this invasion of radical thought by Professor Avery is to do likewise: 
transfer from Suffolk, stop donating money and stop supporting this hate 
speech.

He added: 'Taking action against Professor Avery would in no way threaten academic freedom at Suffolk any more than firing a professor who reveals membership in the Ku Klux Klan.'

Barry Brown, Suffolk University's president and provost, said the university supported the 'free exchange of ideas and robust debate' and respected the 'right of our faculty members to exercise academic freedom.'

He added that Suffolk had always supported U.S. service personnel and that the care package project had been very successful.

Major Roughsedge left for Afghanistan in December 2010 and is expected to return home to New Hampshire next month. The father of three aims to get a teaching job somewhere else.
