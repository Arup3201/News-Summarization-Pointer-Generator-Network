Two amateur historians claim the remains of King Harold, who was shot through the eye at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, lie under an ancient parish church.

Cousins Terry Muff and Kevin McKenzie, who claim to be distantly related to the last Saxon king, have spent years researching the mystery of his fate after his death.

They are convinced his body was carried to Bishops Stortford, in Hertforshire, by his grieving lover Edith the Fair and buried at St. Michaels' Church.

They say there are four surviving, intact Norman stone coffins which have not even been seen since the 19th century in a vault under the church.

The pair are now calling on the vicar to open the vault and say they also expect to find the bones of his partner Edith the Fair and his two brothers.

Mr Muff, a retired police detective, said: 'King Harold II, his long-term wife and lover Edith the Fair and his two brothers, Leofwine and Gyrth, all, in fact, lie in a long forgotten vault at St Michael's Church.

'There are four surviving, intact Norman stone coffins which have not even been seen since the 19th century.

'It is our firm belief that, once an archaeological investigation is undertaken, at the very least, we will find King Harold's wife, Edith the Fair, who was venerated as a medieval saint, and very probably also King Harold and his two brothers.'

Shot through the eye by an arrow, he died at the hands of four Norman knights brutally dismembering his body - or so almost 950 years of history dictates.

But archaeologists are now claiming King Harold may have survived the Battle of Hastings, and lived out his years before quietly dying of old age.

The alternative version of events, put forward in a 12th century document housed in the British Museum, discounts the Normans' portrayal of his death in the Bayeux Tapestry. 

The artwork, long considered an accurate depiction of the 1066 Battle of Hastings, shows King Harold clutching at an arrow in his eye as four Norman knights hack at his body.

But now a team of historians, who discovered the remains of Richard III in a municipal car park in Leicester in 2012, are eager to dispel the long-accepted story.

Oval Film and Stratascan, whose efforts were applauded around the world for the discovery, will carry out an underground scan of Abbey Gardens at Waltham Abbey Church in Essex, the supposed site of King Harold's tomb, to look for his remains.

But the vicar of the church the Rev Derwyn Williams said he is 'unconvinced' by their claims and has refused permission for an archaeological investigation.

Rev Williams said: 'I am unconvinced by Mr Muff's claims and do not judge that it would be appropriate to devote the time and energy needed to seek permission from the diocese and then execute an investigation of this speculation, given the many demands of contemporary ministry, schools work, pastoral care, worship and mission here, to which priority must be given.'

Local historian Paul Ailey said: 'This really is of such historical importance that no objection whatsoever should be raised against a full archaeological survey of the vault and its four coffins, and that their contents be examined by medical experts.

'Bishop's Stortford could well find itself the centre of world attention if the remains of Harold, his brothers and mistress are found beneath St Michael's.

'Stranger things have happened - who would ever have believed that another past king of England, Richard III, would be found beneath a car park in Leicester?'

The reasoning behind Mr Muff and Mr McKenzie's claims remains unclear, and MailOnline is yet to get a response the cousins.

A spokesman for the Diocese of St Albans said: 'We are aware of the Vicar of St Michael's views about Mr Muff's request which quite correctly gives priority to the interests of a busy community of worshipping Christians, serving God and the people of Bishop's Stortford.

'These views would be taken into account and given due weight if there were any case lodged in the Consistory Court, which at present there is not.

'The case would be considered like any case asking for an investigation of the buried remains of any person, loved by their family in life and reverentially buried at death.

'Were a case to be brought, it would be in all likelihood considered by the diocesan chancellor, a judge.'
