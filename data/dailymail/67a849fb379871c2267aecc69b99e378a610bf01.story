Ukraine’s acting leader Oleksander Turchynov issued a warning to Russian separatists yesterday ahead of referendums in two eastern regions demanding to be ruled by Moscow.

He said ‘Yes’ votes today in Donetsk and Luhansk would mean the ‘complete destruction of the economy, social programmes and life in general for the majority of people in these regions’.

He was speaking as the Kremlin raised tensions by threatening the ‘gravest consequences’ for the independent state of Moldova if it sought closer relations with the European Union.

Ukraine was trying to do something similar before the revolution in February that toppled the Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovych.

Separatists hope that pro-secession votes in today’s referendums will persuade Russian leader Vladimir Putin to incorporate them into the Russian Federation, as Moscow did with Crimea earlier this year.

Rebels have also vowed to boycott presidential elections scheduled for May 25, which would make a political settlement to the crisis even harder to achieve.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande have warned Mr Putin of more sanctions against Russia if  the presidential election fails to go ahead.
