In an age where being a 'Protein Princess' is all the rage and 'fit not skinny' is everyone's favourite health mantra, you can't scroll through your Instagram feed without catching sight of Miranda Kerr doing a downward dog or Hilaria Baldwin perfecting her warrior pose.

But our favourite smug health conscious celebrities seem to have lost sight of the difference between inspiring and just plain showing off.

The likes of Gisele, Hilaria, Miranda and Michelle Rodriguez have been spamming our social media feeds with an array of complex yoga poses often using props such as a car bonnet, a luxury yacht or even their cooking stove.

Just practising in your back yard then, Gisele? The supermodel kills two birds with one stone by showcasing her incredible yoga skills and equally incredible view

One of the most prolific celebrities to 
post selfies in complicated poses is Hilaria Baldwin. The 29-year-old 
worked as an instructor for the NYC-based studio Yoga Vida before 
exchanging community classes for a marriage to actor Alec Baldwin and loves showcasing her skills.

Her series of Instagrams showing her posing in awkward locations such as on her stove, on the roof of a car and even on train tracks has helped cement her status as a yoga 
personality - and it seems that other stars and members of the public are following suit.

Now that's just showing off! Naomi Campbell has joined the craze too with some quirky moves on board a luxury yacht

What's cooking? Hilaria takes her yoga practise where no one has been before - to the kitchen stove

That's just train crazy! Hilaria Baldwin is leading the trend for posting crazy yoga poses with the hashtag #yogapostureoftheday

Gisele, meanwhile, 
uses her yogi snaps to keep us up-to-date with her jet-set lifestyle and
 she can often be seen practising her best tree pose against a tropical 
background. Miranda Kerr also favours this tactic, which often accrues 
hundreds of thousands of likes on Instagram.

And it seems that the general public and yoga enthusiasts are following suit - but is it safe?

Speaking about the rising trend, Rich Sturla, Owner and Director of Personal Training at Results Health and Performance, said: 'Yoga is undoubtedly the "in" thing at the moment. From Miranda Kerr to Gisele, it seems like every lithe limbed celebrity is busting some seriously impressive moves on social media, and it's catching on.

'People usually have strong positive or negative attitudes towards yoga. As
 a Health and Performance Specialist, I’m all for anything that gets 
people enthusiastic about exercise and gives people an outlet to relieve
 stress. If you’re not moving, you need to move - regardless of what it 
takes to do so.

'Undeniably, yoga can offer some 
amazing benefits. However, those benefits are only realised when it’s 
taught correctly and tailored specifically to the individual. Otherwise,
 at best, yoga can be marginally helpful and at worst, dangerous.

Humble yogi brag: It isn't just celebrities who are taking to social media to show off their moves and their holiday settings

She's at it too! Rachel Hunter shows off some casual yoga moves as she chills in a bikini in her local park

Limber: Ms Kerr, a serious yogi, makes this backbend look easy - but it is surely not

'We all know that yoga relieves stress
 and reduces anxiety. Between the deep breathing, flow of new postures 
and positive affirmations, you’ll undoubtedly feel better for giving it a
 try.

'However, yoga can over-use the wrong muscles when performed incorrectly. For 
example, the hip-flexors are heavily recruited in many yoga moves.

'Women naturally tend to carry their weight 
too far ‘forward’ and have a tendency to over-arch the lower back 
because the hip-flexors (the muscles that help us raise our legs) are 
too tight (sitting at desks all day doesn’t help). We don’t want to 
compound this potential issue.

The good life: Two yogi enthusiasts show off their yoga pose of the day, with a fairly average backdrop

A spot of sightseeing: One Instagram user uploaded this snap with the caption: 'Reaching for the sky using my yogis tools: mentally, physically and spiritually #yoga #handstandsworldwide #handstandseverywhere'

'To get the most "bang for your buck", instead of yoga, women are better served improving core stability, fixing postural imbalances and improving their strength through resistance training and metabolic conditioning.'

'Overall - if you like the sound of yoga, have no glaring postural issues
 or musculoskeletal injuries and want to see what all the celebrity fuss
 is about, there’s no harm in finding a decent practitioner and having a
 go.

'Be sure to remember however, that 
yoga is just one of a number of 
elements that a holistic health, physique transformation or sports 
conditioning exercise program should contain. Other areas, like 
resistance training for strength and metabolic conditioning for fat 
burning, are where you should invest most of your effort.'

Balanced approach: Yoga, as demonstrated by Lea Michele here, takes careful instruction and coaxing into positions

What's going on here then? Hilaria shows off some more zany yoga moves, this time seemingly posing with a workman's hose in the centre of New York

The new cultural stalwart is drawing ire from the yoga community, which 
claims that these celebrity yoga snaps are nothing more than a publicity
 stunt and do little to promote the ideals of the ancient practice.

Jennilyn Carson, a New York-based yogi who runs a site called Yoga-Dork, told the New York Post: ‘In a sense it mocks what yoga is.’

In
posting a photo and inadvertently seeking followers’ fanfare, the likes
of Ms Carson believe that celebrities negate yoga’s original purpose.

Mrs
Baldwin has spoken out in defence of her yoga photos, arguing that such
'harsh judgments' make for the most un-yogic behavior possible.

She
wrote on Twitter: 'True yogis dont make harsh judgements. So my advice 
to the haters: get on your yoga mat & breath & feel, until you 
make peace with diversity. [sic]'

Stairway to enlightenment? Some experts say that Hilaria Baldwin's Instagram yoga poses are nothing more than a publicity stunt

Rich Sturla shares his views...

Rich Sturla, Owner and Director of Personal Training at Results Health and Performance

Yoga can be good for the brain. Advocates of yoga and 
meditation say it’s great for your mind. Yoga is claimed to boost your 
memory, help you focus and increase the blood flow to your brain.

Yoga rarely differentiates between good and bad range of motion. 
Certain joints in our body - the ankles, hips, and upper back for 
instance - require more mobility training because they’re too 
stable/tight. Conversely, some joints – notably the lower back and 
shoulder joint – require a lot more stability training because they’re 
too mobile. Every joint in our body is designed to function with a 
delicate balance of mobility and stability; some need more of one than 
the other. My main concern with yoga is the tremendous amount of 
lower-back bending that occurs; this is the last thing you want if you 
have back pain. Most back problems arise when we get too much movement 
in the lower back because we lack mobility in the hips, or our core and 
glute strength is too low to prevent excessive arching or flexing of the
 lower back.

Yoga can over-use the wrong muscles when performed incorrectly. 
For example, the hip-flexors are heavily recruited in many yoga moves. Many of us spend all day sitting at a desk; as a consequence our hip-flexors are stiff and tight, and need releasing rather than extra stiffening/strengthening.

Excessively limber people get 
injured with ordinary activities like carrying groceries, and can easily
 break down in sports and worsen existing aches and pains if applying 
advanced yoga moves in the wrong areas of the body.

There are more effective ways to invest your exercise time. Most 
of us lead very busy, modern lives. We want to look, feel, move, and 
perform at our best, and improve our health, physique or sports 
conditioning in the most time-efficient way. Most women already have 
enough flexibility. I believe targeted dynamic mobility work and 
corrective exercises will give a lady all the flexibility she needs. To get the most ‘bang for your buck’, instead of yoga, women are better served improving core stability, fixing postural imbalances and improving their strength through resistance training and metabolic conditioning. Consistency, effort and determination in these areas are what get results.
