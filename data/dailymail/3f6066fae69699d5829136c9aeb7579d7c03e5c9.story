Raphael Varane was thrilled with France's containment of Cristiano Ronaldo at the Stade de France on Saturday night.

Varane, playing alongside Manchester City centre back Eliaquim Mangala, succeeded in keeping the Real Madrid star relatively quiet as France prevailed 2-1 over Portugal.

Varane, who joined Real Madrid from Lens back in 2011, received the ultimate compliment for his defensive efforts when Ronaldo was withdrawn from the action with 14 minutes of the contest remaining.

'We controlled Cristiano Ronaldo well,' the France defender said after the match. 'We all know his fantastic ability and the fact he didn't score is good for us.

'I have known Eliaquim Mangala for quite some time and we understand each other well. We succeeded in being solid at the back.'

Ronaldo, the current Ballon d'Or holder, was upstaged by his Los Blancos team-mate Karim Benzema who opened the scoring for France before setting up another goal for ex-Manchester Untied midfielder Paul Pogba.

It proved a frustrating night for Real Madrid star Ronaldo who was substituted in the 76th-minute of the game 

Varane and Mangala's defensive excellence at the back ensured France's 2-0 lead until a late Ricardo Quaresma goal set up a tense finish, but France held out for the victory.

'Even if there is scope to improve certain things from a tactical point of view, we came out of this game well,' said the 21-year-old.

'It may have been a friendly but you saw the intensity in this match and it was a real international fixture – it's always difficult to play against Portugal.

'We have carried on from our World Cup performances and we're playing good football.'
