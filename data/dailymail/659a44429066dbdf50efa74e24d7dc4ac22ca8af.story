Idea: Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle is understood to be spearheading the move

A damaging split has opened in Ed Miliband’s top team over a controversial plan to commit Labour to renationalise the railways.

Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle, who has repeatedly attacked the ‘fragmentation’ of the current train system, is understood to be spearheading the move. 

But Labour Left-wingers say the idea is being ‘stifled’ by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on the grounds that the party should not make potentially costly spending commitments two years away from the next General Election.

One senior Labour MP said: ‘Maria is simply trying to float the plan for discussion, Balls is trying to kill it off at birth. But how are we going to convince the voters if we don’t have any firm policies?’

However, others warned that nationalising the railways was a ‘multi-billion-pound plan’ that Mr Balls was right to block. 

The row comes amid hints from Mr Miliband that the party will go into the next Election on its most Left-wing manifesto since Neil Kinnock was leader.

Well-placed sources claim that Mr Miliband is being urged to capitalise on public anger over rocketing rail fares by considering returning the main ‘Intercity’ lines to public ownership.

Merseyside MP Ms Eagle has repeatedly
 refused to rule out nationalising the main rail lines, sold off under 
the Tory Government of John Major in the 1990s.

Labour MPs suggested that Mr Miliband – dubbed ‘Red Ed’ by critics for being too Left-wing – was privately sympathetic to the rail plan.

One said: ‘I suspect Miliband quite likes it. After all, passengers are getting royally screwed by the private train companies as it is, so why would it be so unpopular?’

Last night, Tory MP Jason McCartney said: ‘Rail privatisation has achieved massive improvements in infrastructure and service, with passenger numbers way up. Any attempt to reverse that would be hugely costly for the taxpayer.’

A spokesman for Ms Eagle said there had been no decision about  whether lines should be nationalised, and denied there had been any rows with the Shadow Chancellor over future policy.Mr Balls declined to comment.
