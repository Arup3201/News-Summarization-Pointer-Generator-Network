Once iOS 8 is available, users should select Update. 

It is advised that phones are connected to a Wi-Fi network and plugged into the mains. 

Users are also advised to backup their phone to iCloud, or an external drive, to make sure no photos or contacts are lost. 

Apple unveiled iOS 8 in June, and announced at last week’s launch event that the software would be released on today. The release time is based on previous software launches.

Design-wise, the software looks similar to iOS 7, with flat icons and menus.

The search function on Apple’s Photos app has been improved to make it easier to find photos, based on location, dates, or album name.

The Messages app in iOS 8 now lets users capture sounds to send in conversations, including voice notes, ambient sounds and music.

The new Messages app also takes on Whatsapp by additionally letting users send videos, start group conversations and enable Do Not Disturb to hide group notifications until a later time.

Elsewhere, users can send their location to friends, which appear on an interactive map, and send multiple photos and videos from the Camera Roll.

The launch time is expected to be 10AM in Cupertino, which is 6PM BST, 1PM EST and 3AM in Australia. In total, the software will be released in more than 145 countries worldwide

And clicking a photo or video shows all the files shared within a group conversation, without having to scroll through earlier messages.

One of the stand-out features mentioned by Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, at the unveiling in June was the Interactive Notifications tool.

Users can fine-tune edits, and the latest smart composition tools automatically straighten horizons, or crop the image.

There are also smart adjustments that modify the overall light and colour in a photo to balance exposure, brightness and contrast.

Apple has now added time-lapse video modes, accessible through the Record button on the Camera app.

MESSAGES

The Messages app in iOS 8 takes on Whatsapp by letting users capture sounds to send in conversations, including voice notes, ambient sounds or music.

To play these sounds, users can either press the Play button, or hold the device up to their ear and listen like a phone call.

The new Messages app additionally lets users send videos, start group conversations and enable Do Not Disturb to hide group notifications until a later time.

Elsewhere, users can send their location to friends, which appear on a interactive map, and send multiple photos and videos from the Camera Roll.

There is also a Snapchat-style self-destruct button for video messages. 

INTERACTIVE NOTIFICATIONS

One of the stand-out features mentioned by Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, at iOS 8's unveiling in June was the Interactive Notifications tool.

This feature let users reply to texts, emails, accept calendar invites, tweet and send Facebook messages straight from the notification banner.

This means they don’t have to open the specific app, or leave the app they were already using. 

With iOS 8, pressing the Home button twice opens the multitasking menu.

Along the top, users will now see the faces of people they’ve recently talked to, and by swiping to the right, their favourite contacts. This means they can call or text these people with one tap.

And when contacts send calendar invites, for example, they can be added to the diary from the top of the screen.

One of the stand-out features of iOS 8 is Interactive Notifications (pictured). They let users reply to texts, emails, accept calendar invites, tweet and send Facebook messages straight from the notification banner. This means users don’t have to open the specific app, or leave the app they were already using

QUICKTYPE

In iOS 8, Apple has added support for more third-party keyboards and improved its own keyboard to add predictive text.

As a user types, they’ll see a choice of words or phrases the software thinks they will type next, based on past conversations and writing style.

The software can also distinguish between informal languages uses in the Messages app, for example, and more formal language when using the Mail app.

It also adjusts the style based on the person the user is communicating with, because their choice of words is likely more laid back with a spouse than with a boss.

FAMILY SHARING

With Family Sharing, up to six people in a family can share purchases from iTunes, iBooks and the App Store without sharing accounts.

This means family purchases can be paid with the same credit card, and a child’s spending has to be approved from a parent’s device.

Photos and family calendars can also be shared more easily, and everyone on the account can contribute photos to shared albums, for example.

HEALTH

The new Health app on iOS 8 features a dashboard showing all the user’s health and ﬁtness data.

Apple has also created a tool for developers called HealthKit, which syncs other health and fitness apps together.

The Health app puts all heart rate, calories burned, blood sugar, and cholesterol information in one place, and blood type and allergy information can be accessed from the Lock Screen, in case of an emergency.

Apple has also improved its Spotlight tool, (pictured) which searches for files and information on the device, and the web.The app now considers the answer, and uses context to provide the most relevant choices

SPOTLIGHT

Apple has also improved its Spotlight tool, which searches for files and information on the device, and the web.

The tool now considers the answer, and uses context to provide the most relevant choices.

When searching for a person, item or term, a Wikipedia snippet will appear. The new Spotlight identifies hot topics, and knows what’s trending.

And typing the name of a restaurant reveals the closest branch, including phone number and opening hours, for example, too. 

This feature lets users reply to texts, emails, accept calendar invites, tweet and send Facebook messages straight from the notification banner.

It means users don’t have to open the specific app, or leave the app they were already using.

The software is compatible with the iPod touch 5, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, 5S, and 5C, and comes pre-loaded on Apple’s latest iPhone 6 (pictured left) and 6 Plus handsets (right). Users can additionally upgrade their iPad 2, iPad with Retina Display, iPad Air, iPad mini and the iPad mini with Retina display to iOS 8, too
