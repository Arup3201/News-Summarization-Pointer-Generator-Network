There are only two places on earth where  tectonic plates are visible above sea level: Kenya's Rift Valley, and in the south west of Iceland.

On Mount Hengill, an active lava field, just outside Þingvellir National Park, the striking ION hotel stands on a craggy outcrop close to where the North American and Eurasian plates meet, drifting further and further apart, each year.

Boiling water bubbles just 25ft underground here, so when it was built on the site of a geothermal power plant, its creators had to use building materials seven times stronger than standard materials used in Reykjavík.

The striking ION Hotel is situated on Mount Hengill,  an active volcano whose last eruption was around 2,000 years ago

The 45-room hotel is an extension and renovation of the old workers' quarters of the Nesjavellir geothermal power station,  bought  in 2011, with the intention of being the only hotel in this isolated - and beautiful - part of the country.

ION makes use of Iceland's unique geography in two ways: the biothermal energy is harnessed in a spectacular outdoor natural hot spring; and a glass building - the Northern Lights Bar - allows guests to admire the frequent aurora borealis displays.

Owner Sigurlaug Sverrisdóttir, who was born and raised in the region, knows all too about extreme weather, and said the Northern Lights never get old.

She says: 'This respect for Mother Nature is in our blood; our parents and grandparents certainly knew not to mess with her. One month before I was born, in January 1973, there was an eruption on the Westman Island, a small island south of Iceland.

ION is surrounded by natural hot springs, which provide geothermal hot water and energy to the hotel's own natural outdoor pool

Rooms at the ION hotel start at  £184 (bed and breakfast)

'Overnight almost the entire island was covered in lava. The rescue to move the islanders to the mainland was successful mainly due to the fact that all of the fishing boats were in harbour as these as were too rough for the locals to fish. 

'The first boat left with habitants to reach the mainland only 30 minutes after the volcano erupted. Even though I was born here, I’m still fascinated about the lava, moss landscape around ION. 

'I still feel amazed when I see the Northern Lights dancing in the sky on one of my late returns from work. Even though you have experienced it several times before it is different when you are outside of the city, it's much more intense. 

The Northern Lights bar  has floor-to-ceiling glass windows on three sides, making it the perfect vantage point for watching aurora borealis

Inside,  there's a modern, natural  aesthetic created by Icelandic wool throws, Icelandic art, and flower vases, hand-blown by local artists

'I also thrive from the energy; I find immense power in the Icelandic nature. Hence the reason we chose ION for the hotel's name.'  

Everything about the hotel screams Iceland. Inside, lava, reclaimed wood and Icelandic wool are used to furnish rooms, bathroom products are made from Icelandic herbs and everything from the bed linen to the restaurant is organic and fair trade, in line with the island's strong emphasis on preserving its natural beauty.

To experience the tectonic plates up close, the hotel offers snorkelling and diving trips to Silfra, the world's most easily accessible tectonic fissure, where visibility exceeds 330ft. It is here that you can touch the continents of America and Europe at the same time.

The restaurant - aiming to be Iceland's first with a Michelin star - serves up such delicacies such as reindeer, onions, spruce and bone marrow, smoked bone marrow ice cream, sea buckthorn and malt molasses and Icelandic langoustine, locally caught Arctic char and skyr (homemade yoghurt).

Venturing into the wilderness, guests are offered a range of activities from horse riding in mountains around Öflus, fly fishing on Lake Þingvellir, Sólheimajökull glacier tours, rafting and hot spring hikes. 

As well as excursions to the Golden Circle -  south Iceland's most famous sightseeing route, which includes the waterfall Gullfoss and the geothermally active valley of Haukadalur, containing the  Strokkur geyser  - which erupts every five to 10 minutes, guaranteeing an 'ooh' or an 'ahh' from an ever captive audience.

The geologically unstable rift valley of Þingvellir has few houses or hotels, due to its status as a national park

Iceland's spectacular Gullfoss waterfall is situated on the popular Golden Circle, a route tourists can arrange to travel through the hotel
