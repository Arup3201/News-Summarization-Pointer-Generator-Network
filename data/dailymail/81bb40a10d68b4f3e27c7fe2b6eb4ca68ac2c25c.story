A plus-size blogger who once suffered from an eating disorder has revealed why she feels she is prettiest at her heaviest weight and – and why she proudly calls herself fat – as she strips down to her underwear while on camera for a new body image campaign. 

Marie Southard Ospina, from Brooklyn, New York, sheds her clothing as a part of StyleLikeU's video series, The What's Underneath Project, in which a select group of individuals were asked to remove their clothes in order to help prove that style is really about knowing who you are and being comfortable in your own skin. 

'I try to use the word fat a lot in my writing,' the 23-year-old says in her video. 'I use it to describe myself quite a lot, and I think people's initial reaction is, "You're not fat. You're beautiful." That in itself is problematic because that just implies that you can't be fat and beautiful.'

Great cause: Marie Southard Ospina shed her clothes as part of StyleLikeU's new body image video series titled The What's Underneath Project 

She adds: 'It's a characteristic. It's not this horrendous thing.' 

When the clip opens, Marie is fully dressed and sitting on a stool in front of a brick wall. She first removes her hat and throws it on the ground before she begins to describe her past struggles with body image.   

'For a long time my style was just about kind of concealing by body and for maybe until my early twenties it was just about hiding any kind of excess fat,' she says.

Marie explains that she now likes to 'counter a lot of the rules' that plus-size women are told to follow, particularly when it comes to fashion, which means she favors tight-fitting dresses and skirts, as well as bold prints and other things 'that aren't necessarily designed to make you more invisible'.

She adds that people have been 'taught that fat is an inherently bad thing', so when they see a larger woman in clothes that show off her body, they are opposed to it.

Throughout the video, Marie removes her layers of clothing one piece at a time.

She recalls being relatively thin as a child, but says she started gaining weight when she was about nine-years-old. She remembers being bullied in elementary school and describes how her family members would make comments about how she needed to start doing sports.

Marie notes that, because she takes after her father, who is 6'2 and heavy set, her Colombian mother and her relatives didn't understand how her bone structure was different. While their idea of beauty is large breasts and thick thighs – they don’t understand women who are classed as ‘fat’. 

Lots of layers: The 23-year-old blogger was fully dressed at the start of the clip 

Newfound confidence: Marie removes her clothes as she explains that she once had an eating disorder and struggled with body acceptance

'If I was going to be curvy, I was going to be fat and as soon I started dropping weight I just became a rail and my curves were gone,' she says. 'They didn't like that either.' 

Marie says that she believed food was the problem, so she just eradicated it from her life. People didn't realize she had developed an eating disorder at first, and they would often make comments about how her body finally matched the prettiness of her face.

'I think that's the cycle with eating disorders in general,' she says. 'I think you start to get used to the praise, and so you just want to do it more and more. You want to lose more weight. You want to hear that you are doing something good.'

Two years into her eating disorder, her mom realized something was wrong. Marie was quickly told to start working with a nutritionist and was also sent to see a therapist.

She says she gained a lot of weight back in her later years of high school and when she started college she was a size 14 - but she still wasn't eating healthy.

It wasn't until she set off to spend a year studying abroad in Madrid and Prague that she started to accept her body.

'People just didn't seem to look at my size,' she says of the people she met in Spain. 'People when they talk to you they actually talk to you and they're not secretly thinking this girl's a** is so big or she needs to lose some weight.'

Marie adds: 'It was more like people actually made the effort to get to know me.'  

Nothing to hide: Marie even removes her make-up in the video after she notes that she feels her prettiest when she is 'fresh-faced' 

Final pieces: After removing her socks and pantyhose, Marie is left sitting in a lace bra and underwear 

It was there that she met her partner, who she is still with to this day.

Marie describes him is a 'thin, pretty guy' who has never been directly attacked for his body, yet he has 'a lot of problems with how beauty is perceived' and is 'really into body positivity'.

She notes that she feels her prettiest when she and her partner wake up in the morning and she is fresh-faced. 

Marie, who once used to hide in her cover-up, says she wore her first real bikini last year.

'Beauty literally comes in every shape and size and we should be able to use the word [fat] without it being tied to these treacherous connotations,' she explains.

She admits that she has gained weight in the past 18 months, but it is not something that bothers her anymore.    

At the end of the video, Marie is confidently sitting on a stool in her bra and underwear. 

'I’m the fattest I’ve ever been, but I’m also the prettiest I’ve ever been,' she says.
