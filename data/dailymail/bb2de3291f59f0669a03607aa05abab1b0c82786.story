An obese mother was inspired to lose seven within a year to stay alive to care for her daughter, who was born with Down's syndrome.

Weighing more than 20 stone, Stacie Watts, who was a size 26, was struggling to keep up with the demands of her four-year-old, Ellie-Mae.

Endless rounds of hospital appointments, the 28-year-old suffered chest pains that left her fearing for her life.

It was then she vowed to lose weight, for the sake of Ellie-Mae.  

To ensure she didn’t falter she set up a donations page and asked friends and family to sponsor her slim.

Stacie Watts has lost seven stone and dropped six dress sizes after becoming concerned that her life would be cut short and her daughter, who has Down's syndrome, would be left without a mother

Weighing more than 20 stone, Stacie Watts, who was a size 26, was struggling to keep up with the demands of her four-year-old, Ellie-Mae

Her aim, to raise money for the Children’s Heart Surgery Fund at the hospital that  saved her daughter’s life.

Today, after 12 months, Mrs Watts has shed seven stone and dropped to a size 14, raising more than £300 in the process.  

She said: ‘I’d always been big but the thought of dying and not being around for Ellie-Mae and the other children was keeping me awake at night.

‘I owed to her and the rest of the family to be the best mother I could be.

‘But I couldn’t even walk up the stairs without losing my breath and keeping up with all the hospital appointments was exhausting at my size.

'Now there’s no stopping me.’

Mrs Watts and husband Lee Watts, 29, a printer, already had one-year-old son Tyler when Ellie-Mae was born in December 2010.

She was delivered 10 days overdue and not breathing.

The newborn was rushed straight to special baby care where her breathing was stabilised but hours later doctors revealed she had Down’s syndrome.

Mrs Watts, from Louth, Lincolnshire, said: ‘ It was such a huge shock. We had heard of Down’s syndrome but didn’t really know that much about it. 

'Nothing had been picked up at any of the scans so it came completely out of the blue.

‘It made no difference to how we felt about our daughter, we loved her instantly but it was still a lot to take in.’

Ellie-Mae had been born with four holes in the heart, which meant she tired quickly and had trouble feeding.

When the mother-of-three started to suffer chest pains she vowed to make a change to her diet

She said:  I’d always been big but the thought of dying and not being around for Ellie-Mae and the other children was keeping me awake at night. I owed to her and the rest of the family to be the best mother I could'

Within 12 months Mrs Watts has dropped from 20 stone to 12 stone and lost six dress sizes, raising more than £300 for the children's hospital that saved Ellie-Mae's life in the process

The couple took her home at two weeks old but caring for her around the clock as well as her Tyler, took it’s toll on 20-stone Mrs Watts.

She said: ‘Looking after a newborn is always tiring but Ellie-Mae’s extra needs including being tube fed left me exhausted.

‘My weight left me tired just putting my shoes on so I knew I had to do something.’

But their hectic schedule of hospital appointments meant she relied even more heavily on takeaway food.

‘I told myself I didn’t have the times to diet because there was barely enough time to shop let alone cook healthy meals from scratch,' she said.

When she was six months old, on June 3, 2011 Ellie-Mae underwent urgent heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary repair the four holes.

After struggling to fit a conventional slimming club into her schedule she discovered an online plan perfect for busy mothers

Her terrified parents carried her to theatre for the five-hour operation knowing there was every chance they might lose her.

Mrs Watts said: ‘We kissed her goodbye not knowing if we would see her alive again. It was horrific.’

The couple faced an anxious wait to hear if the operation had succeeded and finally the call came.

‘We just buckled with relief and I vowed then that I had to change for Ellie’s sake,' said Mrs Watts. 'If she could go through all that, I could lose some weight.’

But it was easier said than done and the family continued to live on junk food.

Mrs Watts admits she used food as an emotional crutch. She said: ‘If it had been a hard day I would "treat" myself to a few bags of crisps and some chocolate when the kids were asleep.’

And there seemed little point dieting when she fell pregnant again with son Riley, now one.

But when she started suffering chest pains last year, she realised action needed to be taken.

‘I’d always been told my weight would shorten my life but suddenly when I got the chest pains that really hit home. It was diet or die,' Mrs Watts said.

‘Dying just was not an option for me, all my kids needed me, but especially Ellie-Mae because she will most likely always live at home with us.

‘I had to make sure I was around for as long as possible to look after her. I needed to get into shape and got on top of my health for her.

‘Worrying about not being around for her was keeping me awake at night. I thought about all she had been through in her short life and that was my inspiration.’

After struggling to fit a conventional slimming club into her schedule she discovered an online plan perfect for busy mothers like her called the Terri-Ann 123 diet plan.

It had been set up by a mother to offer help and support online to those too busy at attend a club.

She decided to sign up after Christmas in January 2014 but the wake up call came soon than expected.

She said: ‘ My father-in-law posted some pictures of me at a Christmas party on Facebook and I nearly died of shock when I saw myself on screen.

‘I looked horrendous and knew I could not waste another minute.’

She started with earnest but just to be sure she didn’t waver set up a donations page and asked friends and family to sponsor her weight loss to raise funds for the Children’s Heart Surgery Fund which supports the heart unit at Leeds General Infirmary.

She said: ‘I knew I would be less likely to give in if others were relying on me.’

Breakfast: Huge bowl of cereal with full-fat milk

Snacks: Biscuits, crisps, full-fat coke

Lunch: Sandwich or roll with crisps, biscuits and full-fat coke

Dinner: Takeaway meal followed by more chocolate and crisps

Breakfast: An omlette

Snack: Fat-free yogurt

Lunch: A Terri-Ann 123 wrap

Dinner: A Terri-Ann 123 recipe suitable for the whole family, for example  chicken fajitas followed by another 123 recipe of cake and sugar-free jelly

Baby Ellie-Mae was born with four holes in her heart and had to undergo life-saving surgery when she was three years old, at Leeds General Infirmary

Her plan worked and she found the quick simple but healthy meals slipped easily into the family’s busy routine.

‘In many ways it was quicker than getting a takeaway which surprised me and a lot cheaper,' she said. 'All the meals on the Terri-Ann 123 are designed with the family in mind so it suited everyone. I had been kidding myself all along.’

The weight fell of even quicker than she had hoped and by September she had met her first target of losing five-and-a-half-stone and has now lost a total of seven stone.

‘I can long on to the Terri-Ann 123 diet plan facebook page for support or meal ideas whenever I want which suits me.’

She has gone from a size 26 and 20 stone 5lbs to a size 14, weighing 12 stone.

But more importantly the improvement to her health has been dramatic. 

She said: ‘ I can keep up with all the children now.

‘I’m much more hands on, I can play at the park and go on rides with them but the biggest relief is the chest pains have stopped so I no longer lie awake at night worrying about dying and leaving the children.’
