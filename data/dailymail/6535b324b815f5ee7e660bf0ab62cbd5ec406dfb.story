From levies on cabin baggage to billing for printed boarding passes, it seems there's little that budget airlines won't charge for.

Now a new survey has revealed that airlines are charging up to seven times more for food and drink than your local supermarket.

Among the overpriced products highlighted were a 330ml bottle of water that cost 22p in a supermarket but £1.80 on a Jet2.com aircraft while a bar of chocolate priced at 25p on the high street totted up to £1.20 on an EasyJet flight.

Hidden cost: Budget airlines such as Ryanair charge up to seven times more for food than supermarkets

The research, which was carried out by money-saving website TravelSupermarket.com and published in the Sunday Mirror, compared airline prices to those in a typical branch of Asda.

On average, the survey discovered that food and drink were at least 241 per cent higher in the air.

Bob Atkinson, of TravelSupermarket, said: 'Passengers travelling away this summer can easily get caught out by inflated prices for food and drinks, simply by failing to plan ahead.

'Airlines can get away with charging whatever they want for simple items such as a can of your favourite soft drink or a bar of chocolate as customers have no other option once on board the aircraft.

'For those families who have worked hard for their annual getaway, these marked up prices are both unwelcome and unnecessary. Picking up a few snacks before departing for the airport or even in the airport itself can save holidaymakers significant amounts.'

Along with Jet2.com and Easyjet, Ryanair was another airline singled out for its price hikes which included charging £1.74 for a 38p can of 7UP and £1.74 for a stick of pepperami that would cost 50p at Asda.

Price hike: This 38p can of 7UP cost £1.74 on Ryanair while a £1 bag of Haribo totted up to £2.75 on Monarch

Kit Kat chocolate bar: 33p in store but £1.30 on Aer Lingus

Twix chocolate bar: 25p in store but £1.20 on EasyJet

Haribo Starmix (160g bag): £1 in store but £2.75 on Monarch

Pepperami (25g stick): 50p in store but £1.74 on Ryanair

Pepsi (330ml can): 30p in store but £1.60 on Flybe

Red Bull (250ml can): 67p in store but £2.50 on Thomas Cook

Coca Cola (330ml can): 30p in store but £1.60 on Thompson

Other offenders include Flybe, which charges £1.60 for a 30p can of Pepsi, Monarch, which prices a packet of Haribo Starmix at £2.75 compared with Asda's £1, and Aer Lingus which hiked the price of a Kit Kat from 33p to £1.30 - a difference of 294 per cent.

Also in the firing line was Thomas Cook, which charges £2.50 for a 67p can of Red Bull, and Thompson which upped the cost of a can of Coca Cola from 30p to £1.60 - an eye-watering 433 per cent hike.

Asked to comment, a Ryanair spokesman said: 'Ryanair delivers Europe’s guaranteed lowest fares and a range of affordable, top quality inflight food, drinks and snacks on our Getaway Café menu.

'Passengers are free to bring their own snacks on board if they wish.'

Jet2.com, meanwhile, argued that price hikes were the result of catering costs - allegedly much higher in the air.

'We always endeavour to deliver a quality experience, from the moment people start their holidays with us. This includes the catering in-flight where we provide hot food and healthy snacks.

'Our products are sourced from a variety of different suppliers, as are those from other airlines. The costs for supplying an aircraft are far higher than for a supermarket or restaurant and as such we believe this is a very difficult comparison to make. It’s not like for like.'

Easyjet, however, said that prices should be compared to those in restaurants but not in supermarkets.

In a statement, the airline said: 'Our prices should be compared with bars and restaurants rather than supermarkets.

'A supermarket operation will have huge economies of scale, lower cost prices along with lower supply chain and operating costs, is therefore not comparable to the service offering and specialised loading requirements of an airline environment.'
