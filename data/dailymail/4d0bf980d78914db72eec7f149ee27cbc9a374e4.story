Nick Clegg wants new laws to protect journalists' sources

Nick Clegg has demanded new laws to ban police from accessing journalists' phone records to identify their sources without a judge's warrant.

The Deputy Prime Minister has written to the Home Secretary Theresa May urging her to introduce the new protections before the end of the month.

It comes after an official government report found there were not 'adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources'.

Sir Anthony May, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, said the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act – Ripa – left journalists unprotected.

His report said: 'It is recommended that judicial authorisation is obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information.'

A review of the use of the Ripa surveillance powers was launched in October after alarm was expressed about incidents such as Scotland Yard accessing the phone records of Sun reporter Tom Newton Dunn to find who had leaked information on the Plebgate row.

The commissioner found that over a three-year period 19 police forces had sought communications data in relation to 34 investigations into illicit dealings between public officials and journalists.

Some 608 applications for such data were authorised, by a ranking officer. But the report stressed that was just 0.1% of the total applications authorised by police under the legislation.

It also concluded that police had not used Ripa to circumvent other legislation and forces were not 'randomly trawling communications data relating to journalists in order to identify their sources'.

'Generally speaking, the police forces did not give the question of necessity, proportionality and collateral intrusion sufficient consideration,' the report said.

'They focused on privacy considerations (Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights) and did not give due consideration to freedom of speech (Article 10).

'The current Home Office Code of Practice (and the recently revised draft Code said to provide protection for sensitive professions) do not provide adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources or prevent unnecessary or disproportionate intrusions.'

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said David Cameron accepted the commissioner's recommendation.

'He very much welcomes the report. He believes that the report makes the case well for the judicial oversight it recommends in cases of data comms applications that are relevant to journalistic sources and that is why the Government is accepting that recommendation,' the spokesman said.

The Home Secretary Theresa May is under pressure to introduce new laws forcing the police to get a warrant before accessing journalists' phone records

In a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called for legislation to be brought forward later this month.

'As you know, I have consistently raised my concerns about the protection of journalists' sources in relation to acquisition of communications data under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act,' Mr Clegg wrote.

'The report published today by the Interception of Communications Commissioner recommends that 'judicial authorisation must be obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information'.

'We have an opportunity to act on this recommendation at report stage of the Serious Crime Bill in the Commons on February 23. I hope that you will look urgently at drafting Government amendments to that effect.'
