Xabi Alonso has completed a £5million move to Bayern Munich from Real Madrid.

The former Liverpool midfielder had been linked with a move to Manchester United after five years at the Bernabeu, but will now link up with Spanish compatriot Pep Guardiola.

The 32-year-old will provide cover for the German champions after injuries to Javi Martinez, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thiago Alcantara and will, bizarrely, wear the No 3 shirt.

Real Madrid confirmed the move via an official club statement: ‘Real Madrid CF and Bayern Munich have reached an agreement for the transfer of the player Xabi Alonso.

Xabi Alonso is the latest Spanish player to join Bayern's ranks since Pep Guardiola took over as manager.

Javi Martinez was already at the club before Guardiola took over, but he has since brought in Thiago Alcantara, Juan Bernat, Pepe Reina and now Alonso.

Guardiola has also surrounded himself with Spanish staff, such as aide Manel Estiarte, assistant coach Domenec Torrent, fitness coach Lorenzo Buenaventura and match analyst Carles Planchart.

‘The player will appear before the media on Friday at 11:00pm in the press room at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, accompanied by the Director of Institutional Relations Club , Emilio Butragueno.’

The La Liga giants sanctioned Alonso's departure following the arrival of former Bayern midfielder Toni Kroos.Munich's sporting director Matthias Sammer believes Alonso will give Bayern new options, saying: 'If that will work, I would have a very good feeling for the club and the coach.

'After the injuries of Thiago and Schweinsteiger we have been looking for someone, who could help us immediately. And Xabi Alonso could play on top level for two years.'
