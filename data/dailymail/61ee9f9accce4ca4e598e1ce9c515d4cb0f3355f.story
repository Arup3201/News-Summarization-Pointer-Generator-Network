Starbucks has had to apologize for a poster displayed in at least one store that showed Armenian women in traditional clothing drinking the company's coffee under the crescent and star of the Turkish flag.

The posters angered Armenian-Americans because they say more than a million Armenians were killed at the hands of Turkish Ottoman forces in the early 20th Century.  

The Armenian National Committee of America posted a photo of the advertisement on Facebook and asked why the company would use such an image.

The posters, showing Armenian women in traditional clothing drinking the Starbucks under the crescent and star of the Turkish flag, angered Armenian Americans because more than a million Armenians were killed at the hands of Turkish Ottoman forces in the early 20th Century

'Why is Starbucks selling coffee using an image of women, dressed in traditional Armenian costumes, celebrating a Turkish state that systematically victimized Armenian women during the Armenian genocide, and that still denies this crime against all humanity?' ANCA wrote.

More than 1.5million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Forces between 1915 and 1918 in what is now considered Eastern Turkey. 

But the Turkish government has rejected the term 'genocide', claiming both Turks and Armenians committed atrocities at that time. 

The poster was displayed in at least one Starbucks in Los Angeles - a city that's home to more than 440,000 people with Armenian ancestry.

Starbucks has since posted an apology on ANCA's Facebook page and promised to remove the offensive advertisements. 

'Serving as a place for the community to connect is core to our business and we strive to be locally relevant in all of our stores,' a spokesman for Starbucks wrote. 'We missed the mark here and we apologize for upsetting our customers and the community.'

ANCA executive director Aram Hamparian told The Guardian that they became aware of the posters on February 18. ANCA believes posters were could be seen in at least 'two or three locations in Southern California'. 

People lay flowers at the monument to Armenians killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I in Yerevan, in April 2014, to mark the 99th anniversary of the Armenian genocide

'It became very clear very quickly that this was a very serious issue for the entire community, because we started getting a flood of concern,' Hamparian told The Guardian, adding that Starbucks had responded 'very appropriately'.

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the mass killing of Armenians under Ottoman rule, and preparations are happening world wide. 

The mass killings have been recognized as a genocide in more than 20 countries, including the United States, Germany and Russia. 

Armenian president Serzh Sarkisian recalled parliamentary protocols aimed at establishing diplomatic relations with Turkey earlier this month. 

Serkisian accused Ankara of lacking 'political will' and derailing the process with 'preconditions'.  

The killings in 1915 are regarded by many historians as the first genocide of the 20th century, and are said to have inspired Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.
