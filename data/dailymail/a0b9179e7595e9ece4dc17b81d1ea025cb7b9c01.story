A 59-year-old woman from Montclair, New Jersey, has described how she was conned out of $86,000 by a man she met on Match.com.

The two-time cancer survivor, who is pictured but did not wish to reveal her name, says that a man who called himself Maxwell Yas swindled her out of her retirement money over a six-month period in 2012.

The woman, who never met Yas, told CBS 2: ‘It felt good to have that male attention. You want to believe, because you think you’re developing a relationship.’

Scammed for money: This woman, who wished to remain anonymous, was scammed out of $86,000 through a relationship on Match.com

Yas claimed that he was a 60-year-old 
New Yorker who was stationed in Malaysia for his work as a civil 
engineer. He told his online lover that he was experiencing a great deal
 of financial trouble.

The woman admitted: ‘I cashed money out of an IRA; out of, you know, retirement money.

‘I’ve
 always been a very rational person, and everything told me: “No, you 
have to question this. It doesn’t sound right,”’ she said.

She
 insists that she has now learned her lesson: ‘No matter what they say; 
no matter what kind of tale they tell you, you really have to be brave 
and say no.’

A fake story: The man, who went by the name Maxwell Yas, told the woman that he was a civil engineer stationed in Malaysia and was having financial difficulties

Trying to recover: Though the FBI is investigating Mr Yas, the agency says that there is little chance that the woman will recover her money

Though the FBI 
is carrying out an investigation into Yas’s true identity, the agency 
says it is unlikely that the duped woman will recover her money.

Match.com
 has directed those inquiring about the case to its online safety tips, 
which recommend that users ignore all requests to send other users 
money.
