Dr Jennifer Arnold, the star of TLC's The Little Couple, has revealed she has beaten cancer in a series of excited tweets.

'It's official - ME 1 vs CANCER 0... I WIN!' she wrote on Tuesday. 'Thank you for all the prayers, thoughts, & support... What a wonderful way to celebrate #WorldCancerDay! I am done with cancer!'

The 39-year-old mother-of-two, who stars in the show with her husband Bill Klein, was diagnosed in October with choriocarcincoma, a cancer caused by a non-viable 
pregnancy she had suffered.

She underwent intensive chemotherapy treatment - and regularly updated her fans with her progress on Twitter - before announcing the great news on Tuesday.

On the mend: Dr Jen Arnold, star of TLC's The Little Couple, has revealed that she is in remission after beating a rare cancer. She shared this image of her in hospital in December after starting chemo

'I had my official last chemo treatment,' she added to People magazine. 'And while I'm hesitant to say I'm cancer-free - maybe that's common for people who have had cancer - I'm doing great. Everything is moving in the right direction. I am very excited.'

Her blood count will now be monitored weekly to ensure that her cancer does not return, then after several months, she will be tested every month, and then every year.

She added that she was able to get through the chemotherapy - which left her tired and nauseous - with the help of her husband and the joy of her children.

'Bill knows when I'm not doing well and he takes such good care of me,' she said. 'That was huge.

'That and enjoying watching my children play was a huge uplifting part of my treatment. With kids running around, you don't have much time to feel sorry for yourself.'

Joy: She shared her good news on Twitter on Tuesday as she thanked her supporters

Winner: She will now undergo weekly blod count checks to ensure that the cancer doesn't return

Arnold will now ease back into her routine at Texas Children's Hospital, where she is a neonatologist, adding: 'I am anxious to get back to my normal self.'

The reality TV star announced her diagnosis in December, shortly after she and her 
husband brought their second adopted child to their home in Texas. Dr Arnold, her husband and both of their children have 
dwarfism.

The couple had already adopted their son, Will, from 
China and they were in India to bring home their new daughter Zoey in 
October when Arnold began bleeding.

Desperate to stay with her daughter but feeling increasingly faint, Arnold made the difficult decision to return home.

Once
 back in the U.S., she was diagnosed with stage 3 choriocarcincoma, a 
cancer sparked by a non-viable pregnancy she had suffered.

Support: She said that her husband Bill Klein had taken great care of her throughout her treatment

Her
 fertility issues have been well documented on the show, and she was 
shocked when she became pregnant in August - although she said she was 
not surprised that an ultrasound showed the baby had no heartbeat.

'I had figured it wasn't going to be viable,' she previously told People magazine.

The
 embryo was removed but cells were left behind and sparked the 
quick-growing cancer. She began intensive chemotherapy while her husband
 was still in India.

But the
 mass in her uterus failed to respond to the chemo and grew four times 
its size - and then three tumors appeared in her lungs.

Arnold, who has been wearing a wig, detailed the terrifying moment that she learned something was wrong in an interview withÂ  People magazine.

Grateful: Arnold posted this photo to her Twitter account thanking her mother, right, for her support

'There
 are moments I feel just terrible,' she told the publication. 'I can't 
believe it is happening. Other times, I feel like this is just a bump in
 the road.'

Doctors were forced to give her a hysterectomy - which they saw as their last resort because of her small airway.

An initial setback came when her 
chemotherapy was postponed for a week because of low blood counts, 
but said the 'silver lining' was that she was able to have 'a better 
Xmas' with her family.

Throughout her treatment, she shared images with her followers on Twitter - uploading adorable images of her son Will, as well as photos of her in the hospital.

She also uploaded a photograph of her mother to thank her for her support.

'My parents have been a great support during this challenging time! Love them!' she wrote as her lookalike mother posed beside her in the hospital bed.
