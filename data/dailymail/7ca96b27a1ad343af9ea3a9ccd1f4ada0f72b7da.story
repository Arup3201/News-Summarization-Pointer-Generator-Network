Harry Redknapp has told Adel Taarabt to reduce weight and get fit if he wants to become a Barclays Premier League star.

The forward missed pre-season training, struggling with ankle-ligament damage after returning from a loan spell at AC Milan.

Taarabt has started only once, in the League Cup against Burton, and came on in the last minute in the league against Sunderland.

But the Moroccan turned his ankle again in training this week and Redknapp is growing frustrated that the player’s weight is ballooning when he is out injured.

Redknapp said: ‘He’s twisted his ankle, it’s sore again, so we’re back to square one with him. We just can’t get him fit.

‘It’s difficult, he keeps trying to come back and it goes again. Do you rest him for a few weeks? But then while he’s resting, is he going to put on weight? How’re you going to get him fit? It’s such a difficult job with him.

‘He missed the pre-season, that’s the problem. It’s frustrating because he’s a talent, I’d like to have him available against Stoke. He’s got great ability.’

Taarabt has already had one scan on the ankle and will soon have another if there is no improvement.

He was loaned out for all of last season – spending half the campaign at Fulham and the other in Italy with Milan – after being deemed not suited to help QPR’s fight for promotion. But Redknapp believes he is focused on the club again.

He added: ‘He probably thought he was going back to AC Milan, but he’s here and he wants to play. He loves football. We’ve got to get him fit and he’s got to get himself fit. If he does that he could be a big asset to us this year. We all want him fit.’
