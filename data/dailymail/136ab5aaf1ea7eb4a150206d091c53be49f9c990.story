Five firefighters spent an hour rescuing a 15-year-old girl who had wedged herself into a toddler's seat at a children's playground.

The youngster and a friend both squeezed into the seats designed for young children last night at a park in Ramsgate, Kent.

But when their giggling friends realised they could not escape, they had no option but to dial 999.

Playing around: Five firefighters spent an hour freeing a girl who was trapped in a toddler's playground swing

One of the girls freed herself but the other spent an hour trapped before being cut free with hand tools.

The video shot by one of the teenagers shows firefighters arriving and getting to work on the swing.

One tells the 15-year-old stuck in the swing: 'What I'm going to do is we're going to try and get a box under you, and if you stand on that, we can try and get you out.'

The girl's friends are heard swearing and laughing as she says 'ow!' and is lifted onto the box. One says: 'She is actually like full-on stuck.'

In other parts of the three-minute video circulating on Facebook, the teenagers are heard encouraging firefighters to use 'some saw s***' to 'just cut her out'.

As firefighters gather around one of the girls, she tells her laughing friends: 'This ain't even funny!'

When one of the firefighters shines a bright light on the swing, one friend says: 'They've got a f****** thingy'. Another firefighter says: 'I'll get the hacksaw', to more laughter.

A Kent Fire and Rescue spokesman said: 'We were called to Boundary Park to a female trapped in a child's swing.'

'We sent out one fire engine and the crew used small tools to release her from the swing.

'She was then given over to the ambulance service.'

A South East Coast Ambulance Service spokesman added: 'We got the call at 7.50pm. It appeared a 15-year-old girl had got her leg trapped in a swing.

'A crew attended the scene but she did not have to be taken to hospital.'
