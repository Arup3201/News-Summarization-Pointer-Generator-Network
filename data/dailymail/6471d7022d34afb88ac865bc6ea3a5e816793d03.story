A New Jersey mother has given birth to a baby boy in a nail salon after going for a pedicure and foot massage after she was already in labor.

Anna Rubinstein, 35, was not concerned about her son arriving any time soon when she went to Eden Nails in Glen Rock because she had been in labor for 42 hours when her daughter was born.

But baby Damien had other ideas.

Mrs Rubinstein, from Emerson, was having a foot massage on Wednesday afternoon when her water broke - and the little boy was born within minutes.

'There are so many old wives' tales out there and one of them is there are cetain points on your feet that if you massage them in a certain way you're going to go into labor,' she told News 12 New Jersey.

'Apparently it's not such a wives' tale anymore.'

She initially told salon employees who wanted to call for an ambulance that she had plenty of time.

With the help of staff, Rubinstein went to the bathroom and her husband Sergei arrived in time to deliver his son, which he called 'the best feeling in the world'.

An employee, Nancy Wang, told the New Jersey Record that Rubinstein's nails weren't even dry.

'The ambulance came just as she had her little boy,' Wang said. 'There was blood everywhere.'

The proud parents were surrounded by women working in the salon, including one customer who happened to be a nurse and Isabel Valdez, who had been giving Rubinstein the massage.

'I was really glad because the baby was OK,' she told News 12. 'I was so happy to be there.'

After the birth, an ambulance arrived and took the Rubinsteins, including their three-year-old daughter Danica, to Valley Hospital in Ridgewood.

Speaking to News 12 and smiling, Mrs Rubinstein apologized the salon, where she has been a regular customer since it opened five years ago.

'Guys, I'm very sorry that we had a baby in
 your salon,' she said. 'Hopefully you will take me back.'

The salon said its considering marketing the foot massages to mothers who want a quick labor.
