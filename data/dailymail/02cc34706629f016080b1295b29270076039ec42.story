The four-month ban imposed on a senior FA official for making a sexist remark to a female referee has once again exposed the outrageously lenient treatment given to former referee David Elleray.

Northumberland County FA vice-president John Cummings was suspended by an FA regulatory commission after telling referee development officer Lucy May: ‘A woman’s place is in the kitchen and not on a football field.’

May, the partner of the Premier League’s youngest referee, Michael Oliver, had asked Cummings about the possibility of officiating in the North East Sunday League.

Cummings told her she ‘wouldn’t be able to handle it’, adding: ‘It’s nothing against you personally but all the time I’m alive, a woman will never referee in my league.’

In contrast Elleray, who remains chairman of the FA referees committee and is on the UEFA referees committee, was just slapped on the wrist and told to attend a diversity training programme after telling black FA colleague Robert McCarthy: ‘You look rather tanned, have you been down a coal mine?’

It is understood Cummings plans to appeal against his sentence and will cite the way the FA handled Elleray’s racist comment.

Some on the FA council claim there is one rule for a high-profile figure such as Elleray and another for those lower down the FA pyramid.

The FA say no-one complained after the Elleray incident, so it was dealt with in-house, while a complainant in the Cummings case led to the setting up of a judiciary panel.

The most likely outcome from Monday’s FIFA task force meeting on the dates of the Qatar 2022 World Cup is a recommendation for November and December. There is no chance of UEFA’s January-February preference winning acceptance after FIFA president Sepp Blatter and IOC president Thomas Bach agreed that the World Cup must not impact on the 2022 Winter Olympics. And a World Cup in April/May will not be much cooler than a June tournament.

Sky Sports are notorious for cheerleading over their key rights coverage — when does gushing host Ed Chamberlin ever admit to showing a really bad Premier League game? So it’s a worrying new development that the five-year extension to Sky’s England rugby autumn international series contract also includes a top-level sponsorship of the RFU.

No surprises that Leeds’s trigger-happy owner Massimo Cellino took commercial advice from Matt Child, director of trading at Phones 4u, which went into administration with the feared loss of 2,400 jobs. Meanwhile, Cellino’s rash promise to Leeds fans that he would buy back Elland Road from Manchester property developer Jacob Adler for £15m has hit problems over raising a bank mortgage.

Scalpel blunted by Cup

Chelsea, having appointed former Liverpool CEO Christian Purslow as their commercial chief, are expected to join Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal in following the Manchester United ‘scalpel’ approach of dividing up sponsorship opportunities around the world.

But the United blueprint does not necessarily work for a national governing body — the FA are still looking for an FA Cup sponsor despite having brought in Phil Barker, former global sales manager at Old Trafford, at the start of the year to help apply United techniques to secure it.

In their fight against the secondary online ticket market, which is already offering Rugby World Cup seats at vastly inflated prices, England Rugby 2015 have produced a clever video apparently showing Jonny Wilkinson in familiar knees-bent, hands-clasped penalty kick pose. The figure turns out to be someone who can’t kick a rugby ball, with the message: ‘It’s not always easy to spot a fake.’

Accountants Deloitte, who have made their reputation in the sports industry with their annual football rich lists based on turnover — the financial reality is actually far more complex — are predicting a London NFL franchise would be worth £102m a year to the London economy.But that figure can only have been plucked out of the air when it is not known when or if London will field an NFL team.
