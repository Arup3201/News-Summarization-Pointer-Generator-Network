A man who says he suffered a serious heart condition after wearing a Donkey Kong ape costume is suing Nintendo.

Parker Mills was hired to play the ape character  for the launch of a Nintendo 3DS game at Los Angeles Zoo in California.

But he filed a lawsuit against the video games firm at Los Angeles County Superior Court claiming that the job ended up damaging his health.

His attorney, Tyler Barnett, said he was hired for the role in May last year for the launch of 'Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D,' the Los Angeles Times reports.

Mills claims he was denied breaks while talking to zoo guests and did not get a required ice pack to cool him. 

His lawsuit says a company ambassador hired to escort Mills did not provide proper oversight.

His attorneys say Mills suffered a tearing of his aortic walls and now has a permanent heart defibrillator.

Donkey Kong, based on the adventures of a gorilla character, has featured in a series of video games over the last three decades. 

The Times reports that Nintendo last year publicised the launch event as a chance for fans 'to take pictures with the costumed Donkey Kong character around the zoo.'

A call seeking comment from Nintendo representatives wasn't immediately returned.
