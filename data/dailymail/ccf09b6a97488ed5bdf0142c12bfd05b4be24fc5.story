A woman has been remanded in custody after appearing in court charged with giving an 11-month-old boy a bottle feared to contain bleach.

Elaine Joyner, 53, from Deptford, south-east London, appeared at Bromley Magistrates' Court today charged with administering a noxious substance with intent to endanger life, police said.

Jonjo
Freed was visiting a McDonald's in Eltham, south London with his mother
Samantha Cherry when he was given the toxic substance.

Poisoned: Baby Jonjo, now safe at home with mother Samantha and her fiance Ashley Freed, was taken ill after drinking an unidentified liquid given to him by a woman in a south London McDonald's

The
child was being watched by his grandmother while his mother Sam had 
gone to buy an ice-cream. When she returned she found her baby boy 
frothing at the mouth and vomiting.

Staff in the restaurant raised the alarm and police and paramedics arrived at the branch of McDonald's on Eltham High Street.

Jonjo was taken to hospital with his terrified mum as a search for the suspect was launched.

He was discharged on Thursday night after treatment and is now back home with Samantha and her fiance Ashley Freed.

Earlier
in the week a woman was reported attempting to give a bottle to a baby 
outside a branch of Mothercare in Eltham, but was stopped by the childâ€™s
mother.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said Joyner will appear at Woolwich Crown Court on September 21.

Scene: The McDonald's in Eltham where the incident happened on Thursday
