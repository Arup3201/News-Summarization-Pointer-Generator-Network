The jury heard part-time DJ Denver White became as popular as Madonna after fraudsters downloaded his songs in a £1m scam on iTunes and Amazon

A part-time DJ from Wolverhampton became as popular as Madonna after fraudsters downloaded his songs in a £1million swindle on iTunes and Amazon, a court heard today.

Denver White, 26, sold so many tracks he featured in the download sales charts after thousands of stolen credit cards were used to buy his music.

White - known as DJ Denver - and 11 others were involved in the scam which cost iTunes and Amazon up to £1million in royalties that were paid to the musician for each download.

Gang members used at least 24 laptops 
loaded with sophisticated software designed to disguise their location 
and bought music with stolen credit card details.

Through
Tunecore, CD Baby, and SongCast they uploaded about 20 tracks produced by White 
and a number of other artists to fleece iTunes and Amazon between 
January 2008 and June 2009.

Jurors heard eleven others including the 'main man' Craig Anderson, 24, have admitted their involvement in the con.

Prosecutor
Helen Malcolm QC said: 'It was a fraud on both iTunes and Amazon and, 
between them, these companies lost between £750,000 and £1million to a 
collection of lads based principally in Wolverhampton.

'The main man and the main beneficiary was a man called Craig Anderson.'

Anderson and fellow fraudsters discovered they could upload songs via agents on to iTunes and Amazon.

'They then bought a number of, at 
least 24, identical laptops and they got hold, in due course, of 
something called "Hide My IP" which was intended to disguise where the 
downloads were being carried out from,' Miss Malcolm said.

'They
got hold of literally thousands and thousands of compromised credit 
card details, both from America and the UK, and they used those cards to
download their own music from iTunes and Amazon.

'Every time they downloaded their own music an amount of royalties was generated.

Through Tunecore, CD Baby, and SongCast they uploaded about 20 tracks produced by White and a number of other artists to fleece iTunes and Amazon between January 2008 and June 2009

'For each download the amount was very small but, by the time you add it up to hundreds and hundreds of thousands of downloads the amount is quite high.

'They were caught, really, for two reasons; principally because they were greedy and also because the Hide My IP software did not work as they had hoped.

'The police were able to track them through PayPal accounts and email address out to the bank accounts of the 12 people.

'In all they obtained £500,000 before they were stopped.'

Miss Malcom added: 'Why the difference between £1million and £500,000?

'iTunes and Amazon lost the whole amount because they had to repay the genuine card holders the whole amount.

'The royalty payments were, by definition, going to be a portion of that.

'The total amount lost is greater than the total amount of benefit that was obtained.'

White was a part-time DJ in the Wolverhampton area and not a 'big time rockstar'.

'Somebody at iTunes noticed that a complete unknown from Wolverhampton called DJ Denver, also known as Denver White, operating entirely on his own, rather than through a record company and without any marketing that anybody could see, was selling so much on iTunes that his name featured in the volume sales charts,' said Miss Malcolm.

Denver White sold as many downloads as pop queen Madonna as part of the alleged scam, jurors heard

'He was selling so much and earning so much in the way of royalties he was selling at a rate you would expect from the likes of Madonna.'

Three other men James Batchelor, 39, Sheehan Steele, 43, and Michael Clarke, 32, were also said to be involved.

The jury was told that after the fraud was discovered royalty payments were stopped White's music was removed from the site and £113,000 was withheld.

Miss Malcolm said: 'Shortly after they were stopped Tunecore started to get a number of calls and emails from a man calling himself Daniel Thompson.

'Daniel Thompson demanded payment of the outstanding royalties.

'What he did not know was that Tunecore knew there was a fraud and they were in touch with US law enforcement.

'Tunecore hoped to persuade him to identify himself by persuading him to come to New York to collect his royalties.

'They said they were unable to pay that amount of money for tax reasons and he needed to come to New York.

'They offered to send him free air tickets and put him up.

'At that stage Thompson said that the tickets would have to be sent in the name of Denver White and he gave Denver White's real name and real address for the tickets to be posted to.

'That gave the authorities the name of Denver White and further investigation and tracking of where the money had gone to led to the uncovering of all 11 other defendants apart from Denver White, all of whom have been before the court.'

White denies one count of conspiracy to defraud between January 2008 and June 2009.

The trial continues.
