The forensic dissecting of England’s World Cup hopes by Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan looked anything but harsh on Wednesday as Alastair Cook’s ‘retro’ side were comprehensively dismantled by the defending champions.

India, such a rabble in the last three Tests, came alive once the red ball was swapped for two white ones and provided a lesson to England on how to play modern 50-over cricket in conditions that should have suited the hosts perfectly.

It was Swann who said during Monday’s washed-out game at Bristol that England ‘haven’t got a cat in hell’s chance’ of winning their first World Cup next year and, on this evidence, he was being kind to them.

But they were comments that angered his close friend and recent captain Cook, who Swann feels should no longer be one-day leader. ‘It wasn’t that helpful, especially from a so-called friend and after the summer I’ve had,’ said Cook after England’s thumping 133-run Duckworth-Lewis defeat at the Swalec Stadium.

‘Yes I am disappointed because he is a good friend of mine and has been a supporter. But it is what it is. I am going to be captain in this World Cup and we have a good chance but if we play like that we’re not going to win many games.’

Everything was in England’s favour when Cook won the toss and Chris Woakes took two wickets in an over to leave India on 19 for two in what was effectively the first one-day international of a four-match Royal London series.

Yet, under grey Cardiff skies and with the ball nipping around, the back-up seam bowlers blew their big chance to maintain the pressure on India and silence the old players who believe England are stuck in the one-day dark ages.

Chris Jordan, in particular, had a nightmare, bowling 12 wides in 10 expensive, wicketless overs and later departing second ball as England capitulated to a miserable 161 in reply to India’s formidable 304 for six.

Those Indian riches owed much to a 74-ball century from Suresh Raina, not good enough for Test cricket but a formidable proposition in the shorter game, but also to old-fashioned application that is meant to be England’s preserve.

Firstly Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane rebuilt India’s innings as Jordan and Ben Stokes, preferred to Steven Finn and Harry Gurney, bowled woefully and then Raina ran wild in company with his rejuvenated captain MS Dhoni. 

Dhoni looked uninterested and tired as England ultimately thrashed India in the Test series but here he was bristling and imaginative, a perfect summation of the modern priorities of the most powerful nation in cricket.

As, too, was the presence in Wales of a large number of Indian supporters, as many as 40 per cent of the 14,000 crowd, who were conspicuous by their absence during the five Tests, a worry for the health of the ultimate game.

England, in contrast, have always paid lip service to limited-overs cricket but have perennially struggled to find a winning formula and look as far away as ever as they embark on their extensive six-month one-day World Cup build-up.

One of their enduring problems is a lack of penetration in the middle overs and that was exposed here as Raina and Dhoni added 144 off just 16.5 overs to change the complexion of what looked likely to be a low-scoring game.

There was one huge slice of luck for India when Raina should have been given out lbw sweeping James Tredwell on 17 but, after that carnage ensued, with only Woakes and Tredwell able to limit the damage on England.

Much of the criticism from Swann and Vaughan centred on a perceived lack of power in the England line-up and certainly there was considerable expectations on the shoulders of Alex Hales on his 50-over debut.

Yet Hales acquitted himself well and showed he has a solid technique as well as power in top scoring with 40 but becoming bogged down while everyone around him floundered on a pitch that had been spiced up by showers.

Cook could at least point to an unlucky dismissal as the ball from Mohammad Shami that trapped him lbw was shown to have pitched fractionally outside leg-stump but there was little to excuse the bulk of his under-performing side.

The England captain had added 54 with Hales but after he fell his ship quickly sank, all 10 England wickets falling for 107 in just 28.1 overs. A thrashing by any standards.

‘We weren’t at the races and I don’t know why,’ added Cook. ‘It’s frustrating but it’s one game and we will now dust ourselves off and try to play better next time. We’ve got a lot of improving to do.’

When England were thrashed by Sri Lanka in Durham earlier this season they immediately came back with a convincing victory at Old Trafford. Time will tell whether they can do the same against India at Trent Bridge on Saturday.
