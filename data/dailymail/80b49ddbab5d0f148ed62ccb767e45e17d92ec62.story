Steven Hunter has been handed a restraining order banning him from all contact with Yvonne Donlan after pleading guilty to a stalking charge

A grandmother-of-nine has spoken of her stalking hell after her toyboy ex bombarded her with letters, voicemail messages and gifts after she ended their relationship.

Steven Hunter, 45, even crept into Yvonne Donlan's garden to spy on her after ignoring a police warning to stay away from the 62-year-old.

Hunter, of Salford, has now been handed a restraining order banning him from all contact after pleading guilty at Manchester Magistrates Court to a stalking charge.

Ms Donlan, a mother-of-three who works for Salford Council, said: 'It was one of my children who eventually said to me that I should phone the police.

'She said that she thought he would kill me.

'I want to say to other women please do not think it is your fault. Go to the police.'

She met Hunter in a pub in Prestwich in March 2012. She described him as ‘Mr Charming himself’, but said he later became ‘possessive and jealous’.

She said: 'We went out one night with his friends and he thought that I fancied all of them and other people in the restaurant. It was horrible. It was more than jealously, it was weird.'

Ms Donlan ended the relationship in January 2013 but then the harassment began.

She said: 'The texts and answer phone messages started almost at once. He sent me shoes, gloves, champagne and DVDs, mostly love DVDs.

'There were 33 voicemail messages in a month. When the police listened to them, they were shocked. He would say some wild things and he would often say I shouldn’t be scared.

'There was one night when I was in the kitchen talking with a friend about a Rod Stewart CD. The next day the CD had been posted through the letterbox. He would run past my house and my neighbours would see him standing at the end of the street.

'There were around 40 letters. Some were about eight A4 pages long.'

Hunter's actions were described as 'obsessional' by District Judge Paul Richardson at Manchester Magistrates Court (file picture)

Peter Casson, defending, said Hunter was ‘very much in love’ with Yvonne.

He said: 'There was no violence, there was no threat of violence. He has moved on with his life and he accepts the relationship is over.'

District Judge Paul Richardson described Hunter’s actions as ‘obsessional’. He was sentenced to a six-month community order with supervision and a £75 fine with £85 costs.
