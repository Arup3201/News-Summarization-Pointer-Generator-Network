Jules Bianchi’s crash was so shocking that it’s almost difficult to put into words. I was informed of the severity of his accident by the FIA immediately after the Japanese Grand Prix; that it was extremely serious and as such the race result became completely irrelevant. 

You would have seen that Lewis, Sebastian and I did not spray any champagne on the podium. It wasn’t a time to celebrate.

Since the race, I have spent a lot of time thinking about Jules, his family and the people who are close to him.

I will be wearing a sticker showing support for Jules on my crash helmet (right) during this weekend's race 

He has a lot of friends in the paddock – obviously being a Frenchman many of them are from France – so I have been spending some time with them, particularly Jean-Eric Vergne. I flew from Japan to Russia with the Toro Rosso driver and I am staying in the same hotel with him. We have spent that time exchanging our different stories of Jules.

I am really hoping that there is some good news on his condition, but tragically it has to be said that it is looking very serious.

As such, the mood in the paddock ahead of this weekend’s race is very different. Nobody is laughing or having a good time. Everyone is talking and thinking about Jules.

Because I speak French, I have had several chats with Jules since he made his debut at the start of last season. In the picture below you will see me sharing a joke with him ahead of this year's British Grand Prix.

I can’t say I know him that well, but what I can say is that he is highly regarded in the Formula One paddock and certainly considered to be one of the upcoming drivers of the sport.

Everyone is thinking about Jules' horrible accident in the build-up to the inaugural Russian Grand Prix 

We will be wearing stickers on our crash helmets for this weekend’s inaugural Russian Grand Prix to show to the world that we are all still with him. The stickers translate to: ‘Everyone with Jules’.

Of course his accident at Suzuka will be a big topic for the drivers when we meet on Friday evening with the FIA, like we do every race weekend, to discuss the safety of the sport and what we can do moving forward. All the drivers will be there and the focus of the meeting will be how, as a sport, we can learn from this.

On a personal note, did I think it was too dark or too wet in Japan for the race to continue? To be honest, I don’t wish to comment on any of that because it is not my position to say whether it was right or wrong. This is a time for compassion and our thoughts now must be with Jules, his family, and how the sport can move forward from this.

Lacking confidence  

Last time out in Japan I really struggled on the intermediate tyres, which was a complete contrast to the handling of the car whilst I was leading on the extreme wets.

Our car balance was completely wrong from where it should, and usually would, have been, and that is why we were really troubled as a team.

I struggled much more than my team-mate Lewis Hamilton because the balance was so far off and I had so much oversteer, which meant the rear of the car was stepping out all the time.

It was really difficult for me, and probably for the first time this year, it was a race where I really lacked confidence in the car. 

That is my conclusion and explanation for our lack of pace which was unfortunate really.

Rosberg admitted he lacked confidence in the car despite leading the early phase of the Japanese race 

Mercedes were caught off guard which made if difficult for Rosberg during the Japanese Grand Prix 

When it rains so heavily as it did in Suzuka, you go into the race in completely different conditions than you have ever driven before so you are heading into the unknown. 

You have got what you’ve got and you cannot develop your setup as you would do in dry conditions over the course of a weekend.

That made it difficult  for me to drive during the race and that is also the reason why Red Bull were quicker than us on the intermediate tyres because we got the balance wrong.

There was some suggestion we could have adopted a wet setup in qualifying, as Red Bull did, but the oversteer we encountered in the race was impossible to foresee.

It is easy to say in hindsight we should have adapted before the race because we knew the rain was coming, but it is not that easy, and the balance problem caught us off guard.

Despite now being 10 points adrift of Lewis, I still regard myself as being in a good position in the fight for the championship, now that I am the chaser, instead of the one being chased.

Russia makes its F1 bow 

Looking ahead, we are here in Russia for the first time in the history of Formula One. I have been here all week and it is certainly an interesting country.

I’ve driven the Sochi circuit in the simulator and if I was to compare it to a track we have been to before it would probably be Valencia as they have their similarities. 

It looks as though it will be a good circuit and it is always a challenge, as a driver, to adapt.

The Russian Grand Prix is making its debut on the Formula One calendar this weekend 

The Sochi circuit will evolve over the course of the weekend. The best laps will improve by four seconds 

The track has never been used before so the asphalt will get quicker and quicker as the race weekend progresses. 

Indeed we’re expecting the circuit to evolve by something like four seconds a lap between the first runs on Friday and our quickest laps in qualifying on Saturday, which is huge, a different world!

Double trouble  

Mercedes AMG could win the constructors’ championship this weekend and that was obviously one of our main targets of the year. It is great to be where we are and have the possibility to do that would be an amazing feat for our team.

After Russia we have some time off so I will spend some of it with my family and some with the team to prepare for the final three races of the season in Texas, Brazil and then the finale in Abu Dhabi.

Of course, the title could be decided on the new double points ruling which is completely artificial and strange to have such importance for one race, but I guess now that I am behind, it is a good thing. When you are in front it is not so good!
