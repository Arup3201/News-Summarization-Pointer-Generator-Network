I spent the World Cup in the same Rio de Janeiro hotel as Louis van Gaal and some of his backroom staff and, in conversations with him, it was clear he was going from Brazil straight into managing Manchester United without a break.

I thought at the time that leaving behind a highly pressurised World Cup and immediately taking over at one of the biggest clubs in the world would be quite difficult to handle. Ideally, you would want to begin such a demanding job feeling refreshed after a break.

Since then, with a staggering number of injuries to cope with, life just hasn’t got any easier for Van Gaal. And this means results in the opening third of the season were below par and almost certainly failed to meet his expectations.

In some ways it is extraordinary that United are still fourth in the table this morning. The first half-hour at Arsenal last month was as bad as I’ve ever seen them play; worse than their performances under David Moyes last season.

I was travelling for the rest of the game and I was unable to see it live so I was stunned when I heard they had won.

But if you can describe the position they are now in as par for the course — and up until this point they were definitely a few shots over — I would say that they still have some tough holes ahead and are capable of dropping some shots.

The problem for United is no matter how formidable the attacking threat, everyone feels that they have a chance against them because of their defensive weakness. Certainly Southampton will on Monday.

Ronald Koeman’s team are not just ahead of United in the league — they are ahead of them in terms of knowing what their first-choice XI is, what their tactics are and how they are going to approach the game. They, too, had an extremely difficult summer but they have settled into their new identity much quicker than United.

There is a growing assumption that United will now make the top four, which probably was the key target for the club after dipping to seventh place last season, an unprecedented low in the modern era. My feeling is that it will still be very much nip and tuck for them at the end of this campaign; that they may well make the cut but they will just squeeze over the line rather than make it comfortably.

In defence of Van Gaal, you have to allow for the extraordinary injury list with which he has had to cope. At different times he has lost Jonny Evans, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind and Luke Shaw for significant periods. Even if he had his first-choice back four, we all would have pointed to the defence as a potential weakness. Being denied his best players and with constant chopping and changing, it is hardly surprising they have struggled in that area.

David de Gea has had a really good start to the season but the reality is he has been overworked for a Manchester United goalkeeper. The side really should not be relying on him to keep them in games. 

Although United have been scoring goals, they have struggled with a constantly changing rearguard

I see now there are reports they plan to spend another £100 million in the transfer market. If they are to, then you would imagine that Van Gaal’s first priority would be to solidify the defence. Mats Hummels has been mentioned but for me he is ball-playing centre-half. I really like him, but I’m not sure that he is the player United really need.

For me, they require a stopper in the mould of Nemanja Vidic; someone whose first priority is to defend. Atletico Madrid’s Diego Godin, another name mentioned, is more suited to that role.

If you wanted to look at the positives for United, they have at least rediscovered some of their panache compared with last season. When they are in full flow, they are a joy to watch. Wayne Rooney is firing, Robin van Persie showed signs last weekend of getting his form back and Angel di Maria has been superb and they will miss him while he is injured.

If Radamel Falcao can show some fitness, with Adnan Januzaj and Juan Mata to add, Marouane Fellaini showing some form and James Wilson some promise, then they are back to what you imagine a United side to be, with attacking football at its core.

Yet despite that club tradition, United have always built on a strong defensive foundation, too. Gary Pallister and Steve Bruce, Vidic and Rio Ferdinand are as much a part of United’s folklore as their great attacking players.

Until Van Gaal can rebuild a defensive force like that, United will struggle to challenge for the Premier League title.

And if he cannot put things right quickly this season, then the top four could still be beyond them.

RODGERS HANDLING OF GERRARD IS SPOT ON

When I saw Steven Gerrard had been left out last weekend by Brendan Rodgers, I thought it was great management.

Some people would say he was dropped; I would say he was rested. When you leave out a player such as Gerrard, it’s always going to create a great fuss but the reality is that he has to manage his games these days.

And there’s another point that hasn’t been considered. Liverpool have lost Luis Suarez to Barcelona, Daniel Sturridge to injury and Mario Balotelli hasn’t worked out. So Rodgers needs to find another attacking threat from somewhere.

That means he needs to get Steven playing further forward again and, if he’s going to get in and around the box, as he has been doing in recent games, he’ll need even more energy than before. Playing the holding role is a doddle by comparison — you can play there until you’re 40!

That’s why choosing his games during this busy time is vital and I would imagine the manager and the captain would have planned when and where he plays. He’ll definitely be needed for what promises to be a dramatic night on Tuesday against Basel, when Rodgers’ decision to rest Gerrard and others against Real may be vindicated if Liverpool qualify.

And with games against Manchester United and Arsenal in the next two weeks followed by the Christmas period, Rodgers needs a fit and fresh Gerrard to get him some goals.

The failure of Mario Balotelli at Anfield means Liverpool will need to use Gerrard's talents further forward

FINALLY, OWNERS GET THE POINT

Sunday is a landmark. We are 16 weeks into the season and still no Premier League manager has been sacked. That has not happened for 18 years and, if we get to February 16, it will be a Premier League record for managers’ longevity and stability.

You hope this starts a trend. I’d like to think that owners are resisting the early panic sacking, eight games into the season, when it’s always too soon to make a judgment. In fact, I would advocate having transfer windows for managers, so you have to stick with the coaching staff you appoint at the beginning of the season and can’t make a change until January.

For this season at least, it seems owners have grasped the point. Let’s hope it continues.
