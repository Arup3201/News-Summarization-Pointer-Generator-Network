Billions of dollars are on the line 
when a federal trial opens Monday over the reams of litigation spawned 
by the nation's worst offshore oil disaster, though those whose losses 
can't be repaid are hoping for something more elusive: justice for lost 
loved ones.

Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier is pushing back the federal trial over the nation's worst offshore oil disaster by a week, saying Sunday that BP PLC was making some progress in settlement talks with a committee overseeing scores of lawsuits, according to people close to the case.

Two sources told the Associated Press that the judge said BP and the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee were 'making some progress' in their settlement talks. The steering committee is overseeing lawsuits filed by individuals and businesses in the wake of the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico.

Sheryl Revette, whose husband, Dewey,
was among the 11 killed when BP PLC's Macondo well blew out and 
triggered an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, doesn't 
have anything to gain financially from the trial. 

She wants an apology from the oil giant, something she says she hasn't received yet.

'I've never heard a word from them,' said Ms Revette, 48, of State Line, Mississippi 'But an apology isn't going to bring my husband back.'

Barring a last-minute settlement, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier will preside over a three-phase trial that could last the better part of a year.

The first phase is designed to identify the causes of the deadly blowout and to assign percentages of fault to the companies involved in the ill-fated drilling project.

The trial may not yield major revelations about the causes of the disaster, but the outcome could bring much-needed relief for tens of thousands of people and businesses whose livelihoods were disrupted by the spill.

The decisions and actions that led to the explosion and spill already have been painstakingly investigated by the Coast Guard, federal regulators and a presidential commission.

Their probes concluded BP, rig owner Transocean Ltd. and cement contractor Halliburton Energy Services Inc. deserve to share the blame for a string of risky decisions that were designed to save time and money.

Ms Revette, whose husband worked for Transocean, settled her claims against BP last year. But she and other family members plan to travel to New Orleans for the start of the trial, to make their presence felt.

'I feel like Dewey would want me to be there until the end, to see it through. That's who he was,' she said, recalling that her husband once prided himself on being the last worker to leave the rig at the end of a hitch.

'I've never heard a word from (BP). But an apology isn't 
going to bring my husband back.'

Ms Weise, 58, of Yorktown, Texas, 
won't be attending the trial. She already has plenty of painful 
reminders. Adam's birthday was in January.

April
20 will mark the two-year anniversary of the rig explosion. And her 
son's absence will be sorely felt when his older sister gets married 
this weekend.

'Going over there (to the trial) isn't going to change things one bit,' she said. 'My son is still gone.'

The Deepwater Horizon was drilling in
water a mile deep the night of April 20, 2010, when an explosion and 
fire rocked the rig. It burned for two days before sinking. 

An
estimated 206million gallons of oil spilled out of the BP-owned Macondo
well over several months, fouling sandy beaches and coastal marshes and
shutting vast areas of the Gulf of Mexico to fishing.

From the beginning of the 
disaster, many relatives of workers who died on the rig have felt that 
their tragic losses were unjustly overshadowed by corporate 
finger-pointing, legal wrangling, and concerns about the spill's 
environmental and economic impact along the Gulf Coast.

If no settlement is ultimately reached, there will be a three-phase trial that could last the better part of a year.

The first
phase is designed to identify the causes of the deadly blowout and to assign
percentages of fault to the companies involved in the ill-fated drilling
project.

Financial analysts estimate BP could wind up paying anywhere
from $15billion to $30billion over the lawsuits, and BP's chief executive
told a British newspaper that the company has set aside $40 million to deal
with fines and costs associated with the spill.

An AP analysis found that the company could conceivably face
up to $52 billion in environmental fines and compensation if the judge
determines the company was grossly negligent.

'Nobody
cares about the 11 men who died,' said Arleen Weise, whose 24-year-old 
son, Adam Weise, was killed in the blast. 'Did everybody have to forget 
about those men?'

Chris
Jones, whose brother, Gordon, died on the rig, is an attorney. So is 
their father. Mr Jones, whose family plans to drive in from Baton Rouge 
to attend the trial, said he trusts the court will ensure that the right
companies and individuals are 'taken to task' for their mistakes.

'Right
now, it is a bunch of finger-pointing, and nobody is taking 
responsibility for anything,' said Mr Jones, whose 29-year-old brother 
was a mud engineer for BP contractor M-I Swaco and is survived by a wife
and two young sons.

Mr Jones said BP has blanketed the airwaves with ads touting the billions of dollars it already has spent on spill cleanup, yet the company hasn't had the 'common decency' to apologize to his family.

'Instead, they want everybody to think everything is fine,' Jones said. 'They want this to be about money and nothing else. It is going to be about money, but I don't think it's going to work out well for them.'

A BP spokesman said the company has expressed its sympathies to the victims' families from the outset. In a press release less than a week after the explosion, former BP CEO Tony Hayward said: 'We owe a lot to everyone who works on offshore facilities around the world and no words can express the sorrow and pain when such a tragic incident happens.'

The massive scope of the case - a maze of claims and counterclaims between the companies, federal and state governments and plaintiffs' attorneys - has elicited comparisons to the tobacco litigation of the 1990s.

Remuneration: The case will in part decide how much BP has to pay for the disaster, which left marshes like this one in Port Sulphur, Louisiana coated with thick oil and made fishing virtually impossible

Roughly 340 plaintiffs' lawyers have worked on the case. BP has spent millions of dollars on experts and law firms. More than 300 depositions have been taken.

Millions of pages of legal briefs have been filed. One Justice Department lawyer said it would take him 210 years to read all the pages submitted into the record if he read 1,000 pages a day.

Barbier, a former president of the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association and appointee of President Bill Clinton, has a reputation for speedy but fair trials. 

He will hear and decide the case without a jury. Each trial phase is expected to last two to three months, with breaks in between. Even if all parties settle their claims before or during the trial, it could take several months for claims to be paid.

A payout can't come soon enough for Gulf Coast fishermen and oystermen. Mike Voisin, an owner of an oyster processing and sales business southwest of New Orleans, said few if any claims by oyster farmers have been resolved through the $20 billion compensation fund that BP created shortly after the spill.

'We need to get people back to work. It won't happen until this case gets out of the way,' he said. 'Playing the claims game and working with lawyers is not our profession, but it's what we've had to do.'
