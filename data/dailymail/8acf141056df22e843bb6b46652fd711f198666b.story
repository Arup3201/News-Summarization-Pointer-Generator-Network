These are the staggering images of one teenager's enormous contruction made entirely from K'Nex.

Nick Cottreau, from Nova Scotia, Canada, spent more than six months and used more than 25,000 of the toy pieces to create a giant rollercoaster model that fills his entire bedroom.

The fascination and obsession to build mammoth models started when Nick received his first K'Nex set at the age of five.

Obsession: Nick Cottreau (pictured) built the enormous K'Nex rollercoaster using 25,000 pieces

The
 concept behind K’Nex was originally conceived by Joel Glickman who, 
while at a wedding, wondered what he could creates with his drinking straw if he could
 connect it with others.

He and his brother Bob Glickman discussed the idea and shortly after founded K’Nex.

The
 original building system consisted simply of rods and connectors which 
could be easily attached together to make different things.

Over time the K'Nex system has become more complex, however.

Concordia
 University's Women in Engineering chapter has erected models of a space
 shuttle, the Sears Tower, and the Eiffel Tower out of K'nex.

The
 U.S. Space and Rocket Center holds a Guinness Book of World Records 
Award for the 'World’s Largest K’NEX Sculpture' and also has a huge 
space shuttle and rocket in their gift shop in Huntsville, 

Many hobbyists have even included low-power motors and wheels other than K'Nex in their constructions.

Even real bicycles - complete with wheels - have been constructed using K'Nex.

One cycle takes around seven minutes to complete and features numerous lifts, drops, spins and loops which keep the balls moving around the track.

Nick said: 'Sometimes I would work on it every day for a week, sometimes I would not touch it for more than two weeks.

'When I did work on it was either for
 just a short amount of time or sometimes I would spend an entire day 
building and planning.

'I'm
 lucky that the majority of the pieces used in the build were gifts for 
Christmas or my birthday, but if I were to buy all of the pieces new it 
would cost in execs of £2000.

K'Nex
 is a construction toy that was invented by Joel Glickman. It first went
 on sale 1993 and is designed and produced in Pennsylvania, USA.

The toy's building system consists of interlocking plastic rods and connectors, which can be pieced together to form a wide variety of models, machines, and architectural structures. 

The giant rollercoaster model fills the teenager's entire bedroom. His fascination and obsession to build mammoth models started when Nick received his first K'Nex set at the age of five

In total, 
Nick, 16, has more than 37,000 pieces of K'Nex and constantly spends his
 spare time planning out new and more extravagant designs.

He added: 'My friends and family are all generally quite impressed with the machines and find it amazing that I can build stuff as complex as they are'

Nick added: 'My friends and family are all generally quite impressed with the machines and find it amazing that I can build stuff as complex as they are.

'It's interesting to watch people's reactions that haven't seen my machines in a while, they forget how big and intricate it is.

'I've already planed out most of my current machine and I already have a support plan for my next machine.'

Nick said: 'Sometimes I would work on [the rollercoaster] every day for a week, sometimes I would not touch it for more than two weeks'
