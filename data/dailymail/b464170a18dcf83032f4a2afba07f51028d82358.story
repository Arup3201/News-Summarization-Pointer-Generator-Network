A female assistant principal who abruptly resigned after a former student accused her of sexual abuse is facing fresh allegations from a second victim.

Police said the second person came forward after a YouTube video was posted online in which a now 28-year-old mother confronts Andrea Cardosa, a school administrator in Alhambra, California, and former Riverside teacher.

Jamie Carrillo posted the video last Friday where she can be seen calling Ms Cardosa at her office.

Andrea Cardosa has been accused by a former student of sexually abusing her when she was 12 years old

Jamie Carrillo confronted a teacher on the phone last week whom she alleges sexually abused her when she was 12 years old. She said that she did so as she did not want the woman, who is still a teacher, around other children

Ms Carrillo said that the teacher (pictured right) took her on out of town trips and made her feel 'special'

The now 28-year-old mother said that she made the video post as the statute of limitations has run out for her to be able to prosecute and that she didn't want Cardosa around other children.

In the call, she tells the woman, who identifies herself as Ms Cardosa, that she did something terribly wrong at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside 15 years ago. Cardosa replies: 'Yes, and I regret it.'

Ms Carrillo then asks what the woman would do if a student told her that she was having a sexual relationship with a teacher to which she replies that she would involve law enforcement.

She asks: 'So how is that any different from what you did when I was at Chemawa Middle?'

To which the alleged molester answers: 'It's not.'

The 28-year-old alleges that her former teacher abused her when she was a student at a California high school

Ms Carrillo alleges that she was just 12 years old and a player on the school basketball team when the abuse started

Ms Carrillo goes on to tell her alleged attacker that she has children of her own and that her former teacher's actions ruined her life and that she is 'disgusting'.

When she hangs up the phone, Ms Carrillo shows that she made the call on the screen and reads out the number. She says: 'And Iâ€™m shaking like a leaf... not even an ''I'm sorry.'' Or anything. Just that she regrets it.'

Alhambra Unified School District Superintendent Laura Tellez-Gagliano released a statement saying the YouTube link was emailed to the school and they passed it to the Alhambra Police Department.

Ms Cardosa, who was named by Ms Carrillo in the, has stepped down from her job. She had worked at the school for four months, according to officials.

Ms Carrillo's lawyer questioned whether Chemawa Middle School investigated Ms Cardosa who reportedly met the young girl when she coached her at basketball.

Ms Carrillo alleges that the coach kissed her in the locker room and put her hand down the then 12-year-old's pants.

The former student then claims Ms Cardosa, who is believed to have been in her mid-twenties at the time of the alleged assaults, organized out of town trips so that she could have sex with the underage girl.

At a press conference on Monday, Ms Carrillo said that she expected others who had allegedly been abused by the teacher to come forward.

The 28-year-old told KTLA: 'Everything was stolen from me. She just completely manipulated me into thinking that I needed her and I wanted it.'
