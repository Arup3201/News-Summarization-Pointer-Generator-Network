A young mother told she was 'too young' for cancer is now fighting for her life after a delay in diagnosis allowed the disease to spread around her body.

Ashley Daly, 27, now faces a double mastectomy if she is to see her young daughter grow up. 

The 27-year-old, of Cumnock, Ayrshire, has already begun chemotherapy treatment to beat the cancer, and has to wear a wig after losing her hair.

She is now urging other young women to be aware of the disease - and believes they should demand further tests from doctors who dismiss their concerns due to age.

Experts say rates of breast cancer have more than doubled in the last 30 years, blaming the rise on lifestyle factors such as obesity,  alcohol consumption and lack of exercise.

However it is known that genetics also play a big role.

Ashley Daly was told she was too young for breast cancer when she found a lump in May 2014. Now, the 27-year-old, with daughter Sophie, faces a double mastectomy to save her life after being diagnosed

When Ms Daly first went to the GP, she was referred for an ultrasound test but doctors said the lump was due to hormones. Six months later the lump was visible, her nipple was inverted, and she was diagnosed with stage three cancer. She is pictured with her partner Adam, 29 and daughter Sophie

When Miss Daly, a supermarket worker, first noticed the lump in May 2014, she thought that, at just 26, she was too young to get breast cancer.

She only went to the GP after her partner Adam, 29, convinced her to go.

She said: 'After the first appointment, the doctor recommended that I go to the hospital and get an ultrasound.

'They reassured that because of my young age, it was probably just fatty tissue and not cancer. 

'They said it was perfectly common.'

Breast cancer is extremely rare in women in their teens or early twenties and uncommon in women under 35. 

After this, age the risk begins to increase, and the majority of women diagnosed are over 50. 

Having a family history of breast cancer increases the risk of a woman developing the condition.

Miss Daly's mother had been treated for a pre-cancerous breast condition, and has to be monitored by doctors in case it leads to cancer in future.

The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast.

Most breast lumps (90 per cent) aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by a doctor.

Her grandmother also had ovarian cancer, and a women's risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer is greatly increased she inherits a harmful mutation in the BRCA1 gene or the BRCA2 gene.

However, Miss Daly was discharged after being told the lump had been caused by her hormones, and left the appointment feeling relieved.

But six months later she found that her lump was not only still there, but had become bigger and more visible.

She said: 'I got out of the shower and grabbed a hair-band to tie my hair up when I stopped in my tracks.

'My breast had completely changed. The lump had grown so big, it was visible and my nipples looked inverted.'

Fearing the worst, she made an appointment with the GP again and was quickly referred for an emergency appointment to discover if it was cancer.

After another scan and biopsy on the lump, doctors confirmed that it was cancer and that it had progressed to stage three. 

This meant that the cancer had spread from her breasts and had invaded her lymph nodes.

She is currently undergoing intensive chemotherapy in preparation for having a double mastectomy.

Now Miss Daly needs more tests to find out if she is a carrier of the BRCA gene, which would make her daughter more likely to develop cancer.

She said: 'I've told Sophie that I am sick in a way that she understands. I told her that the medicine mummy is taking will make me feel poorly and that my hair would fall out.'

'Every time I wear my wig, she tells me to take it off because she likes my head without it. 

'She will joke about it every once in a while, saying things like I don't need need to wash my hair any more.

'She's absolutely brilliant. I want to make sure I tell her everything and she doesn't feel left out or feel she's done something wrong.'

Now, Miss Daly writes about her experiences on Facebook, hoping that more young women will get themselves checked regularly.

She said: 'I'm disappointed that I was initially dismissed because of my age. A more comprehensive test might have shown the lump for what it was.

'It just shows that you are never too young.

'You need to keep checking regularly, and don't accept age as an excuse for a lump. If you're not sure, always get a second opinion.'

U.S. research has shown nearly twice as many young women are being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer compared to 30 years ago.

A study found that the rate of metastatic breast cancer - which has spread to other parts of the body - rose around two per cent each year between 1976 and 2009 among women aged 25 to 39.

This is the most dangerous kind, with fewer than one-third of women surviving at least five years after diagnosis.

Study author Dr Rebecca Johnson said the increased number of cases of the aggressive form of the disease could be linked to the rising rate of obesity as women eat more and exercise less.

She added that hormonal birth control may play a role.

In the UK, a 2011 study found one in eight women will now develop breast cancer in their lifetime and the rate is rising.

Scientists blame obesity, alcohol and the growing tendency to delay motherhood for record levels of the disease.

Up to 47,700 women are being diagnosed every year, equal to 130 a day - double the number 30 years ago.
