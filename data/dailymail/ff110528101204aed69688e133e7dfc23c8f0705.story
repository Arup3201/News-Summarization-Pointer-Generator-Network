Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has denied a Football Association charge of improper conduct in last week's draw at Hull.

The 47-year-old was sent to the stands after a confrontation with Tigers' manager Steve Bruce as the two Premier League strugglers played out a 1-1 draw at the KC Stadium on March 3.

Gus Poyet and Steve Bruce argue during their two sides' clash on Wednesday evening at the KC Stadium 

The FA charged Poyet whilst Bruce was contacted to be reminded of his responsibilities and it is now believed Poyet will contest the charge and has requested a personal hearing.

The draw left Hull and Sunderland in 16th and 17th place respectively, with the result doing little to help either side boost their survival hopes.

Both face fellow relegation candidates in their next game as Hull travel to Leicester and Poyet's Sunderland welcome Aston Villa to the Stadium of Light.
