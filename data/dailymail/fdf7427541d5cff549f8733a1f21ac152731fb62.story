Paul Scholes believes the reason why many academy players fail to break into their first-team squads is because they are not mentally tough enough.

English clubs are investing more money into their youth set-ups but the representation of home-grown players in the Premier League continues to diminish. 

Scholes, speaking to London Live, says this is because academy products don't have a grounding whilst coming through the ranks due to them being given too much too soon.

Weak: Paul Scholes believes academy players are not strong enough to break into first-team squads

'Our lads, I just don't they're tough enough,' Scholes said. 'Academy players are picked up, taken to school, picked up to take them to the training ground.

The Manchester United legend cites the privileges that young players are given now are taken for granted as opposed to when he was coming through as a youngster in the fabled 'Class of 92' at Old Trafford. 

'They have everything done for them. When we were kids, I'm not saying it's the right thing but, I used to meet Nicky [Butt] and get three buses to the Cliff training ground just to get to training for 9 o'clock in the morning, and the same on the way home as well,' he added.

'I think we were a little more streetwise. These days I think kids are not mentally strong and they get a little bit too much done for them. They're not allowed to mop floors, clean boots, where's the grounding?

'It seems the only thing they're interested in is a little bit of money really and a nice car.

'It's ridiculous. At United it is not as stupid as at some clubs. Whether it is true or not [I don't know] but you do hear rumours.

At the Premier League UNder-21s Final last year, you were hearing Chelsea's players were on 15-20 grand a week. They had not even played a first-team game!'
