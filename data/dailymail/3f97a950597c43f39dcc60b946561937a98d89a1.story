Lionel Messi dedicated Argentina's progress into the World Cup final to Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez, the journalist who was killed in a car crash in Sao Paulo ahead of his country's win over Holland.

Messi, who was held back from celebrating in the changing room immediately after as the forward was called in for random drug testing, was reportedly close to Lopez.

The Barcelona star, the first to score a penalty in the shoot-out that fell 4-2 in Argentina's favour, called his team 'phenomenal' after setting up a final with Germany at the Maracana on June 13.

'I had the doping,' wrote Messi.

'I can't believe this moment I'm living in the locker room. I feel proud to be part of this group!

'They are all phenomenal! The team did it! What madness! We're in the final! Let's enjoy. We have one more step.

'Big hug to all the Argentina fans and a very special memory for Jorge 'Topo' Lopez.

'This victory is especially for you, my friend. A big hug to the family, lots of strength.'

Argentina's
 0-0 stalemate with Holland was in complete contrast to the 7-1 thriller 
the night before between hosts Brazil and Germany.

But Messi can go a long way to settling the debate as to whether he is the world's best footballer by seeing off Joachim Low's terrifyingly-good German side on Sunday.

Lopez, 38, was killed on Wednesday morning when a taxi he was traveling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car being chased by police.

Sport, an organisation the Argentine Lopez joined in 2000, called it 'one of the saddest days in our 35-year history' after hearing of the news.
