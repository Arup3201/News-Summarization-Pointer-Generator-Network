Tipping the scales at 43st, Zsalynn Whitmore, 43, from San Antonio in Texas was unemployed, housebound and miserable.

Zsalynn, a mother of one, had grown so large that she couldn't walk more than 10ft and was too fat to cook or do the dishes.

But after a tough run of bad luck, which included being made redundant, Zsalynn finally decided to do something about her obese frame and is well on her way to her goal weight of 200lbs [14st].

Overweight: Zsalynn tipped the scales at a staggering 43st (600lb) before deciding to change her life

Zsalynn had been a normal-sized child but began piling on the pounds at the age of eight. Although she initially embraced her size, after becoming a mother to her nine-year-old daughter, her weight began to spiral out of control, eventually leaving her housebound.

'Before I lost the weight I was basically unemployed and at home all the time doing nothing,' she explains.

'All day I just watched TV, I didn’t bother to cook or clean. I really didn’t do anything. It really made me feel worthless.'

She adds: 'Not only was
I super-obese, I was knocking at death’s door. Just walking from my bedroom

to my living room would cause me to be breathing heavy.'

Currently weighing in at 320lb [22st], Zsalynn has already lost almost half her body weight - helped along by the gastric band she had fitted last autumn.

Difficult: Her bulk made it hard for her to do normal activities such as cooking and playing with her nine-year-old

Freak show: She says that constant staring in the street and cutting comments made her feel worthless

But her real goal is to get slim enough to work again - and to be able to go out in public without enduring quizzical stares from passers-by.

'Strangers would feel the need to tell me “oh my God you’re so fat”', she reveals. 'I would expect it from children because children are curious, but adults?

'I would be walking to a restaurant, or walking anywhere, and the whole table, everyone in the restaurant would turn and stare. I was kind of like a living freak show.

'It made me feel like I was something to be gawked at, something to be made fun of. It felt normal for people to make fun of me.'

It's a far cry from her younger days when Zsalynn was proud of her size; setting up an organisation named NAAFA [The National Association to Advanced Fat Acceptance] and being squired around the world by men enamoured with larger ladies - her husband among them.

But those days are long gone and now Zsalynn is determined to achieve her goal weight, for her daughter's sake if not her own. 

30lb and counting: Zsalynn was told to lose 30lb by her doctor before she was allowed bariatric surgery

Better: After undergoing surgery to have a gastric band put in, Zsalynn says the weight has dropped off

'My husband and I have been having a really, really hard time in our marriage and in our life and my daughter and I went and stayed at our family ranch, just the two of us, and that’s when I made the decision [to lose weight],' she explains.

'I had been unemployed for, I think, four months at that point and I just decided that in order for me to be able to live a healthy life, I had to do something about it.

'No-one was going to hire me at almost 600lbs. I wasn’t going to be able to get a job, so I lost [weight] to get a better life and not wind up in bed and half dead in two or three years time.

'I feel like I probably lost my job as part of some bigger plan in the universe to put me on this path to get healthy.'

In a bid for extra motivation, Zsalynn signed up to appear on TLC documentary, My 600lb Life, which hits British TV screens tonight and charts her struggle to slim down.

She is filmed having a gastric band put in but before that could happen, she was ordered to lose 40lb by doctors.

Painful: Although the surgery caused her lots of pain, she's thrilled she can now play with her daughter

On the way: Zsalynn has now lost an astonishing 20st and hopes to reach a goal weight of 14st

'Instead of eating the fast food at night I would eat a frozen diet dinner,' she explains. 'I ate two times a day and it would be a 300 calorie frozen meal each time. Then I had surgery and the weight just started falling off.'

Now well on her way to her goal weight, Zsalynn has also added exercise to her daily regime. 'In the beginning it wasn’t like I could exercise a lot,' she admits.

'When I say exercising I mean I started being able to walk without running out of breath. I would walk to the mailbox to get the mail.

'I would park further away from my house rather than park in front of my house. I would park at the next house down -15, 20 extra steps per day. Now I go to the gym every day.'

But although Zsalynn and her daughter are both thrilled about her increasingly healthy body, not everyone is quite so pleased.

Slimmer: Zsalynn, who now weighs just 23st, with her husband. He is less happy about her weight loss

'My husband, he loves me but he loves fat women so he’s really sad,' she reveals. 'He’s sad because the woman he married is not who I am now.

'We have conversations about this probably once a week, [about] how if I had told him that I didn’t want to be a 500lb woman [when I met him], he probably wouldn’t be married to me.

'But I didn’t know that then. I didn’t know that I wasn’t going to be able to walk and I wasn’t going to be able to breathe and I was going to be the main caregiver for our only child. There’s a lot of stuff that I didn’t know.'
