Not many people will have the chance to come eye-to-eye with a whale, but a photographic exhibition with stunning gigantic images of the majestic creatures is changing that.

American artist Bryant Austin is the only photographer in the world producing life-size photos of whales, but in order to capture the breathtaking images, he spends months in waters around the Great Barrier Reef, Tonga and Dominica.

His unique process sees him immersed in the water without moving as he waits for different species of whale including sperm, minke and humpbacks to swim by so he can take the photos.

American photographer Bryant Austin has captured whales from less than two metres away and his work is currently featured in an exhibition at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney

The photographer captured the stunning photos of the animals in waters around the Great Barrier Reef, Tonga and Dominica

With the mammals getting as close as two metres away from him, the magnificent result sees Mr Austin capture the whales at their most serene as they gracefully carve through the ocean unperturbed by his presence.

The detailed portraits show the underwater giants beautifully submerged as the sun shines through the water and creating rippled shadows.

Entitled Beautiful Whale, the exhibition illustrates Mr Austin's 20-year journey exploring waters and taking photos of some of the ocean's largest mammals in all their grace.

On his website Studiocosmos.com it is stated that Mr Austin's life-long passion has been connecting humanity with the 'greatest minds in the water'.

As part of the photographic process, Mr Austin gets within two metres of the whales and this enables him to get all of the animal's intricate details, colours and tones

Mr Austin was inspired to capture the whales in full when he was tapped by a passing 45 ton female humpback whale's two ton, 4.5-metre pectoral fin in 2004

The inspiration for his work was propelled while he was floating motionless when he was tapped by a passing 45 ton female humpback whale's two ton, 4.5-metre pectoral fin in 2004.

At this point Mr Austin was prompted to start capturing the animals in their full scale.

The most crucial aspect of his work is the need to be less then two metres from the whales when he takes the photos in order to capture their true colours, subtle tones and intricate details.

Because of the proximity required, Mr Austin waits for the mammals to come near him, which can see him spend up to three months with small groups of whales.

The exhibition, which is the largest collection of Mr Bryant's work to date, is being shown exclusively at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney until February 1, 2015.

The photos life-size images provide a unique glimpse into the gigantic creatures' world, as they move through the water unperturbed by the artist's presence
