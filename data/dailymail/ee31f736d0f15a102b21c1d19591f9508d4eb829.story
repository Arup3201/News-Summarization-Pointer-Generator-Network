Her enigmatic smile has fascinated and baffled experts for centuries.

But now an amateur art historian claims to have solved the mystery of the Mona Lisa - she was a feminist, who believed that women should be allowed to become priests.

More than 500 years after after Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece, U.S. academic William Varvel has argued that the artist’s muse was a 16th-century activist who favoured a greater role for women in the Catholic Church.

It is generally agreed that the model for the Mona Lisa was Florentine noblewoman, Lisa de Giocondo, whose wealthy husband, a cloth and silk merchant, commissioned the portrait.

The painting is called 'La Gioconda' in Italian.

In a newly published book, ‘The Lady Speaks: Uncovering the Secrets of the Mona Lisa’, the academic wrote: ‘La Gioconda could be a grand statement for women's rights.’

During the course of his career, da Vinci had painted every verse of the final chapter of the Old Testament's book of Zechariah, which anticipates the rise of an ideal and equal society, Mr Varvel explains in the 180-page book.

He did so, Mr Varvel insists, ‘in order to state that women's rights to the priesthood should be recognised.’

For da Vinci, the idea of the ideal society ‘was based upon a universal recognition of both men and women of the laity to have recognised rights of the priesthood of Jesus Christ,’ Mr Varvel said.

He added: 'This perception is the secret that her smile reflects.'

Some of the 40 symbols placed into the background, middle ground and foreground of the painting would appear to back up his theory, Mr Varvel claims.

Calvary, the place where Jesus was crucified, rises from behind the Mona Lisa's right shoulder, while the Mount of Olives, from where he ascended to heaven, is on the other side.

And the folds on the arms of the woman's robe suggest a yoke - a reference to women's oppression, he said.

Other historians have claimed that the model was smiling because she had recently given birth. 

Yet Mr Varvel, a former mathematics professor from Texas, has in fact never seen the Mona Lisa up close.

He said: 'I'm not going to fight the crowd and see La Gioconda.

'If I go to Paris, the Louvre is going to give me a private showing - and if they don't, I won't go.'
