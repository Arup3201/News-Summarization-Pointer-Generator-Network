Most toddlers would face some stern words if they spewed profanities.

But you would be hard-pressed to discipline this adorable little boy who grins cheekily as he rattles off his limited range of expletives.

Clutching a paper cup, and wearing a dinosaur t-shirt, it is slightly shocking to hear him say 'c**p'.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Adorable: Clutching a paper cup and wearing dinosaur pyjamas, he looks around cheekily as he starts his list

He is responding to his uncle asking what rude words he knows, and starts strong with 'c**p'

But then, looking shiftily around, he unleashes his next: 'shut up'.

He then reels off a list of words prefaced by 'butt'.

'Butt head, butt hole, and butt crack,' he blurts out, smugly smirking after each one at the prospect of breaking the rules.

He continues: 'Butt nose, butt face, butt head, butt...crack? Butt ear, butt mouth, butt teeth...butt head...'

'Shut up' is his next expletive, before launching into a comical list of 'butt' words, including 'butt ear'

He stares bluntly at the camera as he unleashes 'butt head' for the third time in his somewhat limited list

His uncle, filming, starts to chuckle at the seemingly endless variations on words featuring 'butt'.

Finally, to round it all off, he lets out an unexpected: 'Sh**'.

It takes his uncle by surprise, who bursts out laughing.

The video has delighted YouTube viewers - although some took to the comment section to blast it as irresponsible.

Stumped, he pauses, before saying 'butt ear, butt mouth, butt teeth' and again: 'butt head'

He looks slightly baffled at his uncle chuckling away as the seemingly endless list goes on

But he sends his uncle into fits of giggles by concluding the performance with a defiant 'sh**'

Some fawn over the adorable child, with one writing: 'This kid is amazing'.

Another wrote: 'So innocent, and then the end!'

One wrote, 'awww so cute!' while another said: 'I only can hope my child will be as versed and familiar with the English language as your son.'

But a handful of commenters have berated the video.

One said: 'Do another video and ask him about good words then I'll watch it.'

Another wrote: 'Foul-mouthed little kid.'
