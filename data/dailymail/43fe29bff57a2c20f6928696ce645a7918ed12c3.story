He has already created history after the first baby was born following a womb transplant. Now Mats Brännström hopes to go one step further – by growing wombs from scratch.

The Swedish doctor is working on growing a womb in the lab.

While it may sound fantastical, teams elsewhere in the world are ‘making’ livers, kidneys and even hearts.

Given to young women who are born without one or have theirs removed due to cancer, the new wombs could allow them to achieve their dream of motherhood.

Surgeon Mats Brännström (pictured third from the right) and his team have already created history by carrying out the world's first successful womb transplant. Now he is working on growing wombs from scratch a lab within a decade

The world's first successful womb transplant saw the birth of  baby Vincent in Gothenberg, Sweden, last month after years of tireless research. He was born weighing 4lbs

The project is still in its infancy, however Professor Brännström envisages taking wombs from dead donors and stripping them of their cells, to leave little more than a living framework.

This would then be coated with stem cells – ‘master cells’ – taken from the young woman’s body. It would then be grown in the lab, before being given to her as a new womb.

Using the woman’s own cells would mean it would be an exact match for her own body – removing the need for powerful and potentially dangerous immunosuppressant drugs.

The Gothenburg University professor has successfully made a rat’s womb, however, it will be decade before he has a womb ready to put into woman.

News of the project has emerged just days after Professor Brännström announced that a baby had been born after a womb transplant for the first time anywhere in the world.

He has been called Vincent - a name derived from the Latin for 'to conquer' - to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to have him.

The breakthrough offers hope to childless women around the world, including some 15,000 in the UK alone who were born without a womb or had it removed due to cancer or other illness.

Baby Vincent’s mother carried him in a womb donated to her by a close family friend.

He is now a month old and a ‘perfect baby boy’.

His mother, who is 36, was devastated to be told at 15 that she didn’t have a womb.

She said: ‘I have always had this large sorrow because I never thought I would be a mother - and now the impossible has become real.'

Vincent’s mother, who has not been named, was one of nine to be given a new womb as part of the pioneering project at Gothenburg University.

Seven of the transplants were successful – and two of the women are just weeks away from giving birth.

In another world first, the mothers-to-be have been given wombs by their own mothers.

In other words, each baby is being nurtured in its grandmother’s womb.

The extraordinary procedure, which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant, means each womb will have carried two generations of the same family.

Professor Mats Brännström, who has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques needed for a transplant, says these two pregnancies prove that Vincent’s birth wasn’t just ‘pure luck’.

He predicts that six of the seven women will become mothers.

He said: ‘If that happens, then it’s a very effective treatment. It’s a costly treatment but it’s very effective.’

News of his success provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb.

However, close to £500,000 is needed if the first British woman is to be operated on next spring or summer.

Richard Smith, a consultant gynaecological surgeon and head of charity Womb Transplant UK, described the Swedish women – including Vincent’s mother, as incredibly courageous.

Mr Smith said: ‘It is a big step, setting yourself up for something that is a big step into the unknown.’

Professor Brännström said he was more focussed and disciplined than the UK team.

However, he believes Mr Smith’s project will be successful and predicts the first British womb transplant baby will be born just three years from now.
