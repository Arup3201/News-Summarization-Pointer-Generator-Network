Murderer: Tyasia Jackson was charged with killing her step sister after getting mad at her

A 13-year-old girl is to be charged with the death of her two-year-old half-sister, after the toddler was found dead behind their family home near Atlanta, Georgia.

Tyasia Jackson was charged yesterday with stabbing young Sasha Lamaya Ray and leaving her in the backyard of the family's home on Waldrop Trail, near Atlanta.

The teenager was looking after her siblings while her parents were out. When they returned they found Sasha at the rear of the house, police spokesman Mekka Parish said.

Their other children were in the house at the time Sasha disappeared.

Authorities
know the cause of death but have not yet disclosed the information. 
They only confirmed that the death is being treated as a homicide.

The victim's biological father, Shelton Ray, said his young daughter is in heaven now.

'She's gone on to glory now. Now it's up to me to make it to where she is,' he told Channel 2 news.

'Like I tell all my children, they have to get themselves into heaven. I have to get myself into heaven.'

He said the teenager called him Monday night around 11pm and confessed to the murder.

Ray toldÂ CBS News Atlanta that the teenager was caught with a boy inside the home while he and her mother were away from the house.

Punished: Tyasia, 13, was charged as an adult and once that ruling was made, her name was revealed

He said a neighbor went to the home and found the boy hiding inside a closet and told him to leave.

Ray said the teen told him that after
the boy and other friends left, Tyasia asked for her siblings to go 
upstairs and kept Sasha downstairs.

The teen told Ray she then took Sasha towards the back door of the home and stabbed her seven times in the chest.

She then threw Sasha's body over the balcony.

Ray told CBS TV that he has a message for his 13-year-old stepdaughter.

'If
I could say anything to her, all I would say is what you did was wrong,
and there are going to be some consequences you have to face,' Ray 
said.

'We are going to help 
you along the way while you face those consequences. But you have to 
change your attitude. As I've always told you, you have to change your 
attitude.'
