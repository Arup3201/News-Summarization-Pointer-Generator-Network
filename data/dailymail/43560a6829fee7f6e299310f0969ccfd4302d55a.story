An eleven-year-old boy has admitted the rape of a six-year-old girl near his home in North Wales.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also admitted three charges of sexual assault by touching and one of common assault on the six-year-old girl when he appeared at Llandudno Youth Court.

Last week the boy, from Gwynedd, in North Wales, had denied the charges when he appeared at Caernarfon Youth Court.

The 11-year-old schoolboy, from Gwynedd, in North Wales, admitted raping a six-year-old girl when he appeared at Llandudno Youth Court

But yesterday District Judge Andrew Shaw was told there had been discussions between the boy's parents, his solicitor and his doctor which had led to a change of plea.

Defence solicitor Nicola Jones said: 'After very lengthy discussions with his doctor, who has known him for many years, it became clear there was nothing medically that could have caused this type of behaviour.

'I have spoken at length with the boy and his parents and advised them of the consequences of a guilty plea and the decision they have taken, on the basis of my advice, is that he will plead guilty to all the charges.'

The boy was accompanied at yesterday's hearing by his father and grandmother. His dad held him close during the ten minute hearing.

A two-day trial due for March is not now needed the judge ruled.

Adjourning the matter for the preparation of reports the judge said: 'It's an extremely difficult case.'

No details of the charges were outlined in court yesterday but at the previous hearing the court heard that he is said to have told the girl to accompany him to a nearby pond to see some fish.

At that spot he is said to have asked the girl to perform a sex act on him, the basis of the rape charge.

It was also alleged he pushed her causing her to fall into the shallow pond.

The offences, which happened last August, came to light when the girl returned home crying, soaking wet and covered in mud and told her mother what had happened.

The judge allowed the boy conditional bail until the next hearing.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
