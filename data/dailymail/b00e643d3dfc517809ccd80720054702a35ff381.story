A video showing former NFL star Aaron Hernandez allegedly holding a gun and leaving his home with his two co-defendants just hours before the shooting death of Odin Lloyd has been played in court.

The footage, taken by the extensive surveillance system in and around Hernandez's Massachusetts house, was captured on June 17, 2013, the day Lloyd was gunned down in a nearby industrial park.

It shows the ex-New England Patriots tight end returning to his $1.3million property, where his infant daughter was being babysat, after celebrating Father's Day with his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins.

After arriving back home at around 12.45am, he is filmed walking through the living room carrying a large black object, before putting it in his pocket. Prosecutors have claimed the item was a gun.

Caught on camera: This video footage, which was played in Bristol County Superior Court on Monday, shows ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez (right) walking through his home carrying a large black object on June 17, 2013

Evidence: Prosecutors have claimed the object Hernandez was holding (right) at around 12.45am that day - just hours before Odin Lloyd was shot dead at an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts - was a gun

On trial: The video also shows the ex-New England Patriots tight end (pictured in court on Monday) returning to his $1.3million property with his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Their infant daughter was being babysat inside

However, when the video was played for jurors on Monday, the object was indiscernible. Hernandez and Jenkins's babysitter Jennifer Fortier, 28, then testified she had not seen the item in the room.

The footage also shows Hernandez and Jenkins being greeted the suspect's two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who are also accused of killing Lloyd, who was dating Jenkins's sister.

And it depicts Hernandez climbing into the front passenger seat of a Nissan Altima rental car and leaving his home at 1:09 am, with Wallace driving and Ortiz sitting in the rear driver's-side seat.

The latter two men have pleaded not guilty to murder. They will be tried separately from Hernandez.

At an earlier hearing, surveillance video - captured at a gas station south of Boston  an hour after the trio had left Hernandez's North Attleboro home - was played to Bristol County Superior Court.

It showed the former NFL player driving the Nissan. Prosecutors have previously said the suspects went to pick up Lloyd, then took him to the industrial park, where he was shot just before 3:30am.

Babysitter: As the video footage was played for jurors, the object Hernandez was carrying on the night was indiscernible. His and Jenkins's babysitter Jennifer Fortier (pictured), 28, said she had not seen the item at all

The Nissan was returned to the rental car agency by Hernandez later that day. It had scrapes along the driver's side, while the driver's-side mirror was missing, according to previous testimony.

Another surveillance video previously played shows Hernandez holding what is alleged to be a gun inside his living room just minutes after Lloyd, a semi-professional football player, was shot dead. 

Earlier on Monday, Judge Susan Garsh told the Fall River-based court that she had received a note from a juror. He was questioned privately at the bench. Trial then resumed.

On Friday, Diane Fife Biagiotti, a Massachusetts State Police crime lab DNA analyst, testified had she found the DNA of Hernandez and Lloyd on a marijuana cigarette recovered near Lloyd's body.

She also said she found Hernandez's DNA on an empty shell casing that had been stuck to a piece of blue chewing gum and removed from the Nissan the suspect had returned to the rental agency.

Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty to murder, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted. He was released from the Patriots hours after his arrest in June 2013.
