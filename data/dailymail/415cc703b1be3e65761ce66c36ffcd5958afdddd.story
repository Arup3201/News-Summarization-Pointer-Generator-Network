After stunning the locals with a giant Tasmanian Tiger  maze last year, a farmer has taken to the fields again to create a shape of a poppy on the sorghum crop.

More than 2000 visitors explored and unravelled the mystery of the five hectare plantation of the thylacine maze in a Hagley farm paddock in Northern Tasmania.

Back by popular demand, owners of the Rupertswood Farm  Anna and Rowan Clark wanted something special for everyone to commemorate ahead of ANZAC Day this year.

'The last service inspired me to do something that would mark a big year for Gallipoli and to reflect on all the people who fought in the First World War,' Mrs Clarke told Daily Mail Australia.

‘This is our second year for the maze so we thought it would be a good fit.

'We had a lot of positive response last year and because the Tassie tiger has been extinct for a very long time, we wanted to add that Tasmanian seam and put a good tune to it.' 

Using the latest GPS technology and a ride-on mower to design the giant poppy, Mrs Clarke said it took her husband seven hours to outline the design through the crop.

'Once the design is done, my husband goes back and forth with the mower and we trim it every week because it grows really quickly. We try to keep it at a length so you don't see each other over the crops.'

With the help from UK crop maze designer Mazescapes, the field of sorghum is carved through using a special intricate pattern on the GPS.

The  couple started the Tasmanian maze last year and received a significant amount of positive feedback

Adding a touch of games to bring the maze to life, Mrs Clarke said it’s an entertaining event for the whole family as well as attracting everyone who are living outside of Tasmania.

‘We are trying it out as an agricultural tourism opportunity and we have a great location so it generates people to come to Tassie.

‘We haven’t done anything like this before but last year, it was so much fun and we loved it – it went down really well. We’re pretty excited about our next maze and we've had a lot of interests.’

The idea came to light one morning around the kitchen table after her husband 'accidentally' cropped on their family's farm paddock.

'We just happened to have an English girl stay with us at the time and she told us how she used to spend her childhood visiting crop mazes with her family when they go away on holidays,' Mrs Clarke said.

‘So we started doing some research and we found how popular the mazes are in Europe and America so we thought we should give it a go.'

With the opening expected to go public next month, Mrs Clarke said there is still a lot of work to do.

‘It’s still a work in progress and we have a few ideas up our sleeves but we can't reveal it just yet,' she said.

‘Last year, our visitors had to find  tiger footprints inside the maze and unlock the codes and unscramble jumbled words – it was an educational aspect but entertaining for the whole family.

‘It was something that people didn’t expect but we've had a lot of people asking us to do it again.'

The Poppy Crop Maze will be open on weekends from February 21.
