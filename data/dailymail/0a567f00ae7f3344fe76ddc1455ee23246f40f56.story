With a former model mother, the face of Gucci as her cousin, and timeless beauty Grace Kelly as her grandmother, Pauline Ducruet has got a seriously good gene pool.

And while she may only be 19, Princess Stéphanie of Monaco's daughter is already showcasing some serious style credentials.

The young Royal joined her family at the Summer Monaco Fight Aids Gala 
wearing a sharp monochrome ensemble brightened up with chunky red wedges.

Making for a very handsome family, Pauline, brother Louis, 20, and their mother seemingly coordinated their matching monochrome outfits.

Pauline added a vampish edge to her look with some rouge lipstick and an on-trend ring bracelet.

Pauline, daughter of Stéphanie and Daniel 
Ducruet, has clearly taken some style tips from her former model and swimwear designer mother.

Her 48-year-old mother's fashion career began early on an apprentice programme at Christian Dior.

Just a year later, she debuted as a model in Spanish magazine ¡Hola!, followed by appearances in German Vogue and the American edition of Vanity Fair.

In 1986, Stéphanie launched a swimwear line, Pool Position, and three years later she launched her own self-titled perfume.

Pauline holds no title but is eighth in line to the Monegasque 
throne. Her grandparents are Prince Rainier III and Grace Kelly 
and her cousin is Charlotte Casiraghi - the current face of Gucci.

Like her aunt, Princess Charlene, Pauline is an excellent swimmer and competed in the Youth Olympic Games for diving.

Miss Ducret's sporting
talents are clearly inherited - her great-grandfather John Kelly -
father of her late grandmother Princess Grace - won three Olympic gold
medals for rowing in the 1920s, while her uncle Prince Albert II has
bobsleighed at five winter Olympics.

She is even reportedly friends with diving extraordinaire Tom Daley on Facebook.

The pair met in 2008 when they competed at the World Junior
Diving Championships in Aachen, Germany, where Daley's late father claimed
the young royal had a crush on his son.

Evolving style: Pictured here with Prince Albert II of Monaco, Charlene Wittstock, and her mother in 2010, it is clear that Pauline has always had an eye for fashion
