Russia's foreign ministry has hit out at Australia's Foreign Minister labeling her comments on the Russian aid convoy to Ukraine as 'absurd' and 'irresponsible'.

Julie Bishop this week accused Russia of trying to shift people and equipment into eastern Ukraine  by claiming there was a humanitarian crisis in the area.

But the suggestion that the several hundred trucks headed for eastern Ukraine could be a pretext for military intervention reportedly frustrated Russia's foreign ministry.

A statement from the Russian government department said that 'burdened by their own oversized ambitions, some members of the current Australian Government have completely lost an adequate picture of the developments in Ukraine', Itar-Tass news agency reports.

'They keep making absurd statements that the humanitarian convoy to help civilians in the south-east of Ukraine can be used as a pretext for Russia’s ‘armed invasion’ of the neighbouring country,

'Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has gone farther than others in making irresponsible innuendoes against our country even though one would think that her position presupposes building bridges between countries, not destroying them.'

Australia has imposed sanctions against Russian officials and companies over the current situation in Ukraine.

A convoy of 280 trucks is currently on its way from Russia to Ukraine.

The trucks are carrying 2,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid, including 400 tonnes of cereal, 100 tonnes of sugar and 62 tonnes of baby food.

There's also 54 tonnes of medical equipment, 12,000 sleeping bags and 69 generators headed Ukraine's way.
