Scientists have long warned that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from bleaching, caused by rising water temperatures

But there is a bigger risk to the colourful coral – and it comes in the form of exploding populations of carnivorous starfish.

Crown of thorns starfish have an enormous ‘appetite for coral flesh’ and each adult can chomp through up to 10 square metres of precious coral tissue every year.

Acanthaster planci, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns starfish, is a large, multiple-armed starfish (or seastar) that usually preys upon hard coral.

The crown of thorns receives its name from venomous thorn-like spines that cover its upper surface.

It is one of the largest sea stars in the world, the largest being probably the sunflower seastar .

The adult crown-of-thorns is a carnivorous predator that usually preys on reef coral polyps.

It climbs onto a section of living coral colony using the large number of tube feet on its oral surface and flexible body.

It fits closely to the surface of the coral - even the complex surfaces of branching corals - and extrudes its stomach out through its mouth over the surface to virtually its own diameter.

The stomach surface secretes digestive enzymes that allow the starfish to absorb nutrients from the liquefied coral tissue.

This leaves a white scar of coral skeleton which is rapidly infested with filamentous algae.

Researchers at Australia's Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in Queensland, north-east Australia, have mapped the dinner plate-sized starfish’s pattern of destruction.

They said that there is around half as much coral cover in the region as there was 27 years ago and the destruction of the reef is continuing at an alarming rate.

Dr Katharina Fabricius, coral reef ecologist and AIMS principal research scientist told the BBC World Service’s Discovery programme that crown of thorns starfish are a bigger problem than bleaching.

Corals are bleached when they are 
stressed by changing conditions – such as the rising temperature of 
water – and expel the algae living in their tissues, which causes them 
to turn white.

‘There are three main sources for the coral decline, one is storms, however 42 per cent is attributed to Crown of Thorns Starfish - and just 10 per cent due to bleaching,' she said.

Mapped: Scientists mapped Crown of Thorns populations. Blue dots indicate an area free of infestation, green recovering populations of coral, yellow a young colony of starfish and red an active outbreak of the predatory animals

‘This compares with 70 per cent due to bleaching for reefs elsewhere in the world, such as in the Caribbean.’

The starfish are a ‘major cause for coral loss’ and Australian scientist are now looking at ways to control the destruction they are wreaking by smothering coral and eating their flesh.

They think the population explosion could be down to starfish larvae thriving when their phytoplankton food is present in high concentrations after flooding.

Starfish larvae-friendly nutrients are being produced in vast quantities as a result of excessive fertiliser being used by farmers – particularly in Queensland where sugar cane is grown - that washes into the rivers and runs into the sea.

By looking at how the larvae live in a lab and analysing historical flood records, the scientists think the higher rate of survival of larvae when nutrients are readily available spawns the transportation of millions of them by ocean currents to the reefs where they settle, grow up and feast on the coral in vast numbers.

While crown of thorns starfish have always been present in the reef and their populations have fluctuated, scientists agree that the time between population explosions has lessened dramatically.

The abundance of nutrients has boosted the number of starfish larvae surviving into adulthood.

In times of phytoplankton famine very few survive, but as each female can produce between five million and 20 million eggs, starfish epidemics can be massive in numbers.

Scientists say the starfish are ‘a major threat to the long term viability of coral reefs’ and a new and effective way of controlling the invasive species is desperately needed.
