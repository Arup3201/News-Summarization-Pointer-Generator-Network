This is the moment six robbers on motorbikes horrified shoppers during a high-speed smash-and-grab.

Dressed in black and wearing crash helmets, the robbers raced through a shopping centre on three powerful motorbikes just after opening time yesterday.

The three who were riding pillion leapt off and used axes and bats to smash windows of a jewellery store.

Dramatic: This is the moment robbers on motorcycles raided a shopping centre jeweller's shop armed with axes today

Raid: The gang reportedly stole hundreds of thousands of pounds of jewellery. This image shows the smashed window at the front of Fraser Hart

Witnesses said the men sped into an upper area of the shopping centre and headed for the Fraser Hart jewellery store, at Brent Cross Shopping Centre in North London

They are believed to have taken Cartier and Rolex watches as well as other items of jewellery before speeding off. 

Witnesses described how shoppers began to panic as the robbery took place, with many people running for the exits. Some shops would not let customers leave while the incident was underway.

Michelle Webber, 36, was at the 
shopping centre when the robbery took place. She entered at the same 
entrance which the gang are believed to have used, close to John Lewis 
and New Look.

She said as she entered - about 10 minutes before the robbery took place - she heard a man behind her say: 'let the fun begin'.

Shortly afterwards she described how a wave of panic gripped the shopping centre.

'A man came running towards us shouting 'everybody out'.

'My first thought was that there was a
bomb and I just started thinking about my children and my family, my 
stomach turned. People started running out of the stores in a panic.

'There was a surge of people coming towards us. They were all running at the same time away from what was happening.

'All of a sudden the shutters started 
coming down in the shops around us and we realised that something 
serious had happened. I caught up with the guy who had been shouting and
he said there were some guys upstairs on bikes with pickaxes who had 
broken into the jeweller's.'

Probe: Police officers and security guards from the shopping centre quickly closed off the crime scene as hundreds of shoppers looked on amazed

Crime scene: A section of the shopping centre was closed off as the investigation into the robbery started

Photographer Rick Treister was on his way to the Apple store in Brent Cross when he heard the sound of screaming and breaking glass.

Seconds later the three bikes came roaring towards him past Clarks shoe store.

He said : 'I did not have time to be frightened, the whole thing did not seem real.

'It was like the James Bond film, you could not believe something like this was happening inside Brent Cross.

'I just grabbed my camera phone and 
managed to get one picture. The guy on the front bike shouted something 
at me when he went past.

'The whole place was going mad. The 
women in John Lewis were screaming and the man in the jewellery store 
ran out after the robbers shouting “You b******s!'

Shocked: Shoppers were left frightened after witnessing the robbery

Damage: As well as taking jewellery, the gang also left a trail of destruction in the shopping centre

'Watches were just dropping off the motorbikes as they went. They accelerated away and I don’t know where they went after that.'

Speaking to Barnet and Whetstone Press, 
Richard Treister, 48, said: 'It was like a Hollywood film.

'I would never
have imagined someone would do that in a shopping centre. It was like a
scene out of James Bond.'

Another eyewitness, Claire Smalley, told the BBC: 'We looked out and we saw six men, 
two on each bike so three bikes, pull up outside Fraser Hart and then 
they pulled out an axe and they were getting into Fraser Hart and 
telling everyone to stay back.'

The dramatic raid happened just 15 minutes after the centre opened to members of the public.

There were no injuries, however, an elderly man was treated for shock at the scene.

Brazen: The gang, who rode into the centre on three motorbikes, left with a haul of watches and jewellery from Fraser Hart jewellery store

A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman 
said: 'No firearms were seen. The suspects fled the scene on the 
motorbikes in the direction of Hendon Central.

'The motorbikes were subsequently found abandoned a short time later at a nearby golf course.'

A spokesman for Brent Cross Shopping Centre said: 'We can confirm that there was an incident at the centre earlier this morning when there was an attempted robbery on a store at Brent Cross.

'The police have cordoned off a section of the centre to investigate the incident and we are assisting them with their enquiries. 

'A small area is closed off to the public and Brent Cross staff are directing customers to alternative entrances.  The majority of stores remain open as normal.'
