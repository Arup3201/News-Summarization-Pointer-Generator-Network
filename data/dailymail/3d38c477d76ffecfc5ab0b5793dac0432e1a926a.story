Youth clothing retailer Urban Outfitters is causing controversy selling a cropped 
monochromatic t-shirt that has the word 'depression' covering it in 
different sized fonts.

It's described as a 'Super depressing tee from Depression topped with an allover logo graphic.'

The
 t-shirt has been reduced from $59 to $9.99, but so far has just one 
scathing review: 'Depression is not a fashion statement, UO should not 
be promoting social stigma for depression by making it a catchphrase,' 
wrote the review, giving the item one star.

Depressing: Many are offended by this t-shirt being sold by Urban Outfitters

In
 fairness to Urban Outfitters, the brand that produces the t-shirt is 
Depression, whose philosophy is 'Because living life the conventional 
way is depressing.'

'Absolutely disgusting what urban outfitters are selling. Disgraceful. I don't know how that is allowed,' one Twitter user tweeted.

'This is vile, does Urban Outfitters not know how offensive and triggering these tops are?' tweeted another.

The offensive t-shirt comes two years after the company pulled a controversial t-shirt 
from its website after angry critics condemned it online.

The offending item was a gray, V-necked t-shirt with the words, 'Eat Less' written in cursive across the front.

The cotton t-shirt was photographed on a very slim, angsty-looking model and paired with a black mini-skirt.

Offensive: This t-shirt was pulled from the Urban Outfitters website in 2011 after critics lambasted the retailer for glamorizing eating disorders

The description read, 'Eat less or more or however much you'd like in this seriously soft knit tee cut long and topped with a v-neck.'

The Twitterverse exploded in disgust at the perceived glamorization of eating disorders by the clothing giant.

Actress Sophia Bush wrote an open letter to Urban Outfitters on her blog addressing the t-shirt.

'You should issue a public apology, and make a hefty donation to a women’s organization that supports those stricken with eating disorders. I am sickened that anyone, on any board, in your gigantic company would have voted "yes" on such a thing, let alone enough of you to manufacture an item with such a hurtful message.

Not fabulous: A 'Ghettopoly' board game is held by a demonstrator during a protest outside an Urban Outfitters store in Philadelphia. Many in the black community were outraged over the game, sold by the retail chain Urban Outfitters, that has 'playas' acting as pimps and game cards reading 'You got yo whole neighborhood addicted to crack. Collect $50...'

'It’s like handing a suicidal person a loaded gun. You should know better,' she wrote, adding that she intends to boycott the store.

The hipster chain has managed to put many different groups offside with its products over the years, including Jewish people (a t-shirt emblazoned with 'Everyone Loves a Jewish Girl' and dollar signs), Irish people (St Patrick's Day shirts that read 'Kiss me I'm drunk, or Irish, or whatever') and African Americans (a board-game iteration of Monopoly called Ghettopoly).

In 2012, the Navajo Nation filed suit against the company for creating a line of merchandise including underwear and a drinking flask and called it Navajo.
