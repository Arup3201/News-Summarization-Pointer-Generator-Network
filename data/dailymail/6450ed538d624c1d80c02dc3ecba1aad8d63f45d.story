Putin, pictured earlier this week in Moscow, is believed to have visited The Hague to see Maria and was spotted in a local supermarket

Her father has been blamed by many for the death of 193 Dutch citizens.

So for Maria Putin, who lives in a smart suburb of The Hague, relations with her neighbours must be more than a little strained right now.

The 28-year-old is reported to have resided in the Netherlands for several years with Dutch partner Jorrit Faassen, 34, an executive for a Russian consultancy firm.

He owns a two-storey penthouse apartment at the top of a luxury high-security block in Voorschoten, next to an idyllic canal.

Yesterday, anti-Putin activists from around the world were posting the address on Twitter and urging Dutch people to set up a protest outside.

One wrote: ‘Dear Dutch ppl! If you want to visit Putin’s daughter, [this is the] address.’

Another posted: ‘Dutch people can express their feelings about #MH17. Ask for Maria Putin (Faassen).’ 

Among the Dutch victims were nine residents of The Hague, including a family of four, a local artist and a newly-married couple on their honeymoon.

There was also 17-year-old schoolgirl Elsemiek de Borst, whose heartbroken father Hans de Borst has spoken out about Putin’s involvement.

He said: ‘Maria Putin may have nothing to do with this.

‘However, her father is very powerful and I think he had the power to send some Russian military forces to this crash site to guard the victims over the last few days. Despite this, he decided not to.

‘Mr Putin and other parties in this, I have reason to believe that one of them is the murderer of my child.

‘Maybe indirectly, maybe it was not the intention. But the separatists were able to obtain these weapons and that was the outcome.’

The mayor of
 the city of Hilversum, Pieter Broertjes, yesterday called for Ms Putin 
to be deported from the country in a radio interview.

He
 later apologised for his comments, saying the demands were 'not wise' 
but 'stemmed from a feeling of helplessness that many will recognise'.

Maria
 is understood to divide her time between Russia and the Netherlands, 
with the couple remaining very much within Putin’s inner circle.

She
 appears to keep her distance from her neighbours and her father and his
 staff are said to keep a close protective watch over her.

Putin
 is said to be so paranoid about her safety that he has not allowed her 
to be photographed as an adult in the Russian media and sent her to 
university under a different name.

Her new enemies on social media will do little to ease Putin’s fears for her safety.

Last night, there was no answer at the buzzer of her apartment and her neighbours were reluctant to talk about her.

‘I’m sorry, I can’t help you,’ said one of the few to answer. ‘I don’t know who lives there and I don’t want to comment.’

Local residents have in the past claimed to have seen her father in the local supermarket, while one said they saw a blacked-out limousine in the underground car park.

One ominously told a local reporter: ‘The family have something dangerous about them.’

Another said: ‘There are some things that it is better not to know.’

Maria is reported to have married Fassen in the summer of 2009, although there is no official record.

He was a real estate specialist with Russian gas firm Gazprom before being appointed vice-president of Stroytransgaz, also Russian, in 2008, at the age of 28.

According to land registry documents, a year later he began buying up property in Voorschoten.

He bought the main apartment for a bargain price of £292,000 and now owns two other apartments in the same building. The apartments are now worth an estimated £545,000 each.

The district where they live is aptly named the Krimwijk, meaning ‘Crimea district’.

His connection to the Putin family is thought to have served him well when his BMW was rammed by a Mercedes owned by Russian banker Matvei Oerin in 2010.

Seven of Oerin’s bodyguards pulled Faassen out of his car and beat him up, but the banker was later prosecuted, jailed and stripped of the licenses for four of his five banks.

Faassen left Stroytransgazin 2010, his last known job was as Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of ACO MEF-Audit, a consultancy firm.

The apartment is a short drive away from The Hague’s City Hall, where grieving families and friends of the dead have been signing a book of condolences.
