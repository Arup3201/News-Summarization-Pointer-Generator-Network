After shooting to fame on Sex, Lies and Rinsing Guys, it's fair to say Danica Thrall knows how to manipulate men to get her own way.

But now her flirtatious behaviour has landed her in hot water in the Celebrity Big Brother house yet again as she faces eviction for a second time.

The 24-year-old beauty was slammed by love rat MC Harvey, incredibly without a hint of irony, for causing a 'love triangle' between former pals Mike 'The Situation' Sorrentino and Prince Lorenzo Borghese.

Emotional: Danica Thrall burst into tears as she confronted Mike 'The Situation' Sorrentino about nominating her for a second time

And she was forced to listen to every word of their criticism as Big Brother ordered the group to make their nominations in front of each other yet again.

Before the contestants even took to the sofas to deliver their verdict, Martin Kemp admitted he had been shocked by the glamour girl's behaviour in the 'Gods and Mortals' task, explaining she had been 'teasing' both The Situation and Prince Lorenzo.

Speaking in the Diary Room, he said: 'The whole argument between Danica and The Situation has been caused by Danica's bed-hopping. She teases those boys.

'It's disgraceful': MC Harvey fumed about Danica's behaviour to Prince Lorenzo following the nominations

'They think they can snog her. Danica
led Lorenzo to the point where I thought he was going to propose. She 
knows what she's doing and she's very good at it.'

But worse was yet to come when Danica's fellow housemates slammed her behaviour in front of her.

And
not one to shy from flinging the insults MC Harvey said: 'I'm sick of 
this love triangle situation, and I think she was one of the main causes
of The Situation and Lorenzo becoming distant when they used to be 
friends.'

Perhaps he was speaking from experience as the So Solid rapper is well-known for cheating on his wife, TV's sweetheart Alesha Dixon, with singer Javine Hylton - subsequently breaking up his marriage after creating his own love triangle.

And the beauty was shocked when The Situation turned against her for a second time, saying: 'Danica uses my emotions against Prince. Although I do care about her, let's see how the public feels.'

Upsetting: The housemates were forced to make their nominations in front of each other yet again

Meanwhile, Samantha Brick added: 'We've got very different views on how you treat and respect men.'

Danica was left in tears at the end of the nominations and decided to confront The Situation on why he had put her up for eviction again.

'I would never have done that to you. Never,' she said. 'I thought out of everyone I could rely on you, like I said I could.'

Upset: Danica looked on as she was nominated by Ashley, Harvey, Julie, Samantha and The Situation

But the Jersey Shore star claimed his decision was tactical, saying: 'I practically love you, but I know you have a boyfriend.'

And Danica's actions caused a further divide between the group when Prince Lorenzo attempted to stand up for her against MC Harvey.

However, the rapper immediately hit back in a scathing attack, suggesting the model's behaviour has been 'disgraceful'.

'I'm sick of this love triangle': The Celebrity Big Brother housemates fumed that they were fed up of the model's incessant flirting

He fumed: 'She's got a boyfriend and how she's acting is wrong. She's flirtatious, she's sexual with people. I've watched it.

'Do you think going into your shower and flashing your boobs at someone is OK? She doesn't carry herself like someone who has a boyfriend and I honestly think it's disgraceful.'

But Danica wasn't the only one left in tears after the night's events.

Nominations time: In turn, Danica chose to put Samantha and Ashley up for eviction

Coleen Nolan sobbed in the Diary Room after claiming former Coronation Street actress Julie Goodyear was playing a 'vile game'.

She told Big Brother: 'Julie is so f***ing two-faced. I have felt a b***h coming in here s***ging that woman off, but she is playing the game in a vile way.

'She says she loves me but p**s off, Julie. You haven't loved me since day one. But you're loving the young ones because you want to come across as a hip 70-year-old.

Sobbing: Coleen Nolan was also reduced to tears in the Diary Room after claiming Julie Goodyear was playing a 'vile game'

'I didn't nominate her because I thought she's a national treasure and thought everyone would hate me. But I don't care anymore.

'Julie's been out to get me from day one. I just wish she'd stop telling me she loves me because it makes me f***ing sick.'

Danica Thrall, Coleen Nolan and Samantha Brick will face eviction from the Celebrity Big Brother house tomorrow night (Friday).
