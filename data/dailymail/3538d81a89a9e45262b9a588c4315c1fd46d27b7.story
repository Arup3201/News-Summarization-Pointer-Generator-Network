A hopelessly lost pensioner who set off on a three-hour journey at breakfast time was caught driving the wrong way down a motorway at 4am - after 19 hours at the wheel.

Maureen Darvell, 83, travelled seven miles down the fast lane on the wrong side of the M3 as cars swerved to avoid her before she was arrested.

The pensioner got confused on a 175-mile journey from her home in Ashford, Kent, to a relative's wedding in Bristol and spent almost a day on the roads trying to find her destination.

Banned: Maureen Darvell, 83, spent 19 hours trying to get to the wedding in Bristol before she was arrested driving the wrong way down a motorway. She is now selling the car

After heading towards London, she took a wrong turn on the M25 and ended up driving towards Bournemouth.

She realised she had made a mistake 110-miles into her trip and changed direction.

But rather than heading north-west towards her destination she went north-east - back from where she had come.

Confused, she eventually pulled over on the A303 at Micheldever in Hampshire, around 60 miles north-east of Bournemouth, for a coffee in the early hours of the morning.

When she left the service station - after nearly 19 hours on the roads - she accidentally drove back down the carriageway she had arrived on - into the oncoming traffic.

She went up a slip road onto the M3 and drove a total of seven miles down the fast lane hoping to find a gap in the central reservation so she could turn round.

Lost: Maureen left her home in Ashford, Kent, on September 8 and was eventually arrested near Basingstoke on the M3 driving the wrong way down the fast lane. She was heading for Bristol

Folkestone Magistrates' Court was told the pensioner set off in her 15-year-old Nissan Micra on the morning of September 9 - and was not found until after 3.30am on September 10.

Victoria Urmossy, defending, told the
court: 'Mrs Darvell left her home in Kent at 9am and took the wrong 
turning off of the M25 and became lost.

'When she got to Bournemouth she knew she had taken a wrong turn and tried to find her way back.

'She stopped at the service station and she is still not sure what time she left - but she was extremely tired.

Lost: Maureen, 83, should have got to Bristol from her home in just three hours but got very confused - and ended up near Bournemouth

'On the dual carriageway she realised 
that she was going the wrong way so she moved to the lane alongside the 
central reservation trying to find a gap.

'She could see traffic on the other 
carriageway going the way she wanted to go so she stayed in the outside 
lane looking for a break in the central reservation crash barrier so she
could cross over.'

Neil Sweeney, prosecuting, said police
received 'lots of phone calls from drivers' about the slow moving Micra
in the overtaking lane.

He told the court: 'Mrs Darvell 
continued along the A303 and then continued along the slip road onto the
M3 travelling north on the southbound carriageway.

'She was stopped by police at junction 6 for Basingstoke at 3.50am around seven miles from where she had set out.

'When she was stopped, she confirmed she knew she had been travelling the wrong way.

'She was asked why she had not turned around and she replied "Because I did not want to go that way".

'It was then she explained to police 
she was travelling to Bristol. It was just before four in the morning, 
she had set out from Ashford the previous day.'

The court heard how Darvell, who 
pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, had been driving for 50 years and 
had only ever received one speeding ticket.

Magistrate Elaine Sawyer banned the pensioner
from driving for 15 months, telling her: 'You will be fined £100 with 
£85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge, which you must pay at £10 a 
fortnight.'

She was also ordered to retake her 
driving test if she ever wanted to be allowed out on the roads again. 
However, she told the court she was planning on selling her car and 
'upgrading to a mobility scooter'.
