A star college football player is giving up his promising senior year in the sport to support his fiancée, who is currently battling leukemia.

Ben Pike, who would have been a senior defensive lineman for the University of Toledo’s team, is hanging up his cleats and helmet to care for Ashlee Barrett.

Ms Barrett was initially diagnosed with the disease last April and had been in and out of chemotherapy. She made the heart-wrenching discovery late last month that the leukemia had returned.

Mr Pike, who is originally from Mentor, Ohio, met his fiancée at the University of Toledo. The two were an unlikely pair.

According to the Toledo Blade, Ms Barrett, now 23, transferred to the university as a junior in 2009.

Mr Pike , now 22, was a freshman and was dating another woman. The two became friends in a Bible study group and eventually started dating.

But the two were both skilled in 
athletics – Ms Barrett played for the women’s basketball team before 
being forced to quit after a career-ending surgery.

‘She’s one of the most beautiful people I’ve ever met,’ he told the Blade last October, adding: ‘She is the kindest and most caring person I’ve ever known.’

Two years later, in December 2011, the Rockets football team was in Washington, D.C. for the Military Bowl, an annual event which takes place around the holidays.

He proposed on the front lawn of the White House, having cleared it with a staffer days earlier. 

‘I knew pretty quickly she was the one,’ he told the Blade.

Opposites attract: The couple first met at the University of Toledo at a Bible study; Ms Barrett had transferred in as a junior and Mr Pike was a freshman

Ms Barrett graduated and was teaching in St Louis when she found out she had leukemia. It was April of 2012. 

From the moment he heard about his fiancée’s condition, Mr Pike planned to end his football career so he could be with the love of his life as she battled the disease.

'She's one of the most beautiful people 
I’ve ever met. She is the 
kindest and most caring person I've ever known.'

‘He’s not giving up anything,’ Mr Pike’s mother, Becky Pike, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. ‘He’s really fighting for life.’

Ms Barrett is incredibly thankful for her fiancé in her time of need. ‘I know I couldn’t have gotten through it without Ben,’ she told the Plain Dealer.

‘He’s been a rock for me throughout this whole experience.'

Now, Ms Barrett is back in St. Louis and undergoing another round of chemotherapy. The Plain Dealer reports that two donors have been found for a potential bone marrow transplant; doctors hope to operate in April.

In the meantime, Mr Pike is finishing up his last year of college, and plans to teach social studies upon graduation. He still plans to wed Ms Barret in June following her operation in April.

He visits her in St Louis on weekends, and plans to move to the Missouri city in May. 

‘I’m not sure how much she knows it,’ he told the Blade, ‘but she’s an inspiration to me every day.’
