Many consider it to be the most emotionally fraught meal of the year.

But it doesn’t need to be provided you get ‘that big sheet out’ and start planning on Monday according to Mary Berry.

According to the Great British Bake Off star preparations need to be underway for the Christmas Day turkey and trimmings by Monday December 1.

The cookbook writer, 79, said the date marks the time that hosts should be getting ‘that big sheet out’ and starting to work out the arrangements for the day.

Offering her tips for Christmas, Miss Berry said: ‘Christmas dinner is all about organisation. The more you think about it, the easier it is. It is only a big roast dinner. Monday is December 1 and that is the time to get that big sheet of paper out and start planning and the more you think about it, plan it, it is… it’s only a big roast dinner.’

She added: ‘And not on the back of an envelope mind, a proper big sheet of what you’re going to do – you do your cards by this time, what shopping you can do, what you can do for the freezer, what you can get ready and what is last minute.’

It spells bad news for anyone who thinks they can make do with a quick dash to the supermarket the week before Christmas.

Most shops are already selling their festive ranges. And Miss Berry said it’s worth spacing out the shopping and cooking by beginning it weeks in advance. It also helps spreads out the cost according to Miss Berry, whose cookery business empire is thought to be worth as much as £5million.

Miss Berry said: ‘You should be making the puddings and cakes now, although not everyone’s like that. Just do as much ahead as you can. Then it’s a nice feeling that it’s done.’

She added: ‘The more you can do ahead the better. I think really you’ve got to find out who’s coming for Christmas, how many there are and even now get in the heavy, the tinned goods. Spin out the costs.’

Ms Berry said when you consider it, Christmas is only a big roast dinner and pretty simple to prepare 

Miss Berry also said she precooks her turkey, before driving it to her son’s house for dinner. The only thing she doesn’t start on early is gift-shopping.

Speaking at the Specsavers National Book Awards, as she received a lifetime achievement award, Miss Berry said: ‘I wait for my family to give me lists. I have a very gorgeous daughter and daughter-in-law and I say please tell me what you’d like. I don’t do things out of the blue for them, because they know what they want.’

Miss Berry, who is best known as a judge on Great British Bake Off, has written more than seventy cookery books during her 50-year career. She also has product ranges at Lakeland, Sainsbury’s and John Lewis and a line of salad dressings.
