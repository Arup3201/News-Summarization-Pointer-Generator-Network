Traffic jams bring out the worst in many of us – but few will go quite this far to get things moving again.

As this man cycled along a country lane, his leisurely pace apparently infuriated one driver so much that she abandoned her car and ran after him.

In a video posted on YouTube, the red-haired woman can be seen trying to push the man over, kicking his bicycle and shouting and pointing at him.

Confrontation: The angry woman can be seen raising her leg to kick the cyclist during the YouTube clip

Quite what he had done to provoke such a reaction is not clear, but one YouTube user suggested the man was a fox-hunting supporter who deliberately held up traffic near Bibury, Gloucestershire, to delay anti-hunt campaigners. 

Officers say they do not know why the fracas took place, but revealed they were looking at the possibility it was caused because of their opposing views on hunting.

It is understood that hunt meetings regularly take place on Saturday in that area during the hunting season, which typically runs from November to the spring.

A spokeswoman for Gloucestershire Police said: 'Until we have spoken to both parties involved we can’t speculate as to why this altercation took place, however, whether it is connected to members of a hunt or hunt supporters and anti-hunt protestors is one line of enquiry.'

Police said an unidentified woman had called to report being ‘assaulted by a cyclist who had been holding up traffic’ on January 28.

A police spokesman said: 'On this day, a woman called Gloucestershire Police to report that she had been assaulted by a cyclist who had been holding up traffic.

'Officers have made a number of enquiries to locate this woman but it appears that the contact details she gave were incorrect.

'As part of their enquiries officers seized footage that had been posted on YouTube that is believed to be connected to the same incident.

Raised arms: The pair can be seen scuffling in the middle of the lane as the cyclist comes to a halt

Anger: The 23-year-old points an accusatory gloved finger at Mr Cox

'The footage shows a man cycling along a road when he is approached by a woman on foot who pushes him; they then get into an altercation.

'Investigating officers have been working to identify the individuals, but to no avail. They are now turning to the public for their help.'

Gloucestershire Police is asking those involved or any witnesses to contact them on the non-emergency number 101.
