Police in a Maryland suburb made a grisly discovery Friday morning when they responded to what authorities described as a 'very horrific and bloody crime scene' inside a home where they found the bodies of two young children.

Two other children were also found seriously injured inside the home, as well as a 21-year-old woman who police described as having superficial injuries. 

Authorities say that the mother of the children - identified only as a 28-year-old woman - currently is in custody after trying to run from the home after authorities arrived.

Grisly: Police described the scene inside this Maryland townhouse as 'very horrific and bloody'

Bloody: Authorities suspect that this knife found outside of the home could be the murder weapon

None of the children have been identified - authorities will only say that they are siblings and all are under 10 years old.

Authorities first were called the Germantown home in the 1900 block of Cherry Bend Drive about 9:30 p.m. Thursday when a neighbor called 9-1-1 to report that a child was left alone in the backseat of a car.

Before police arrived, two women came outside and retrived the child from the car - and confronted the neighbor who called 9-1-1.

The responding officers knocked on the door of the home but got no response, nor did they see or hear anything they deemed suspicious.

The officers then left the home and called Child Protective Services, which planned to follow up on the family Friday morning. 

Before CPS could visit the home, authorities were again called about 9:30 a.m. Friday in reference to blood found in the driveway where the child had been left the day before.

The night before the bodies were discovered, police were called to the home after one of the children was left in this blue car

When police arrived on the scene, they found a knife on the sidewalk leading into the home. 

Officers then had to force their way into the home, where they found the victims and a 'very bloody' crime scene. The children were each found in bedrooms, and may have been asleep at the time of the attack.

When police entered the home, a woman - presumably the mother of the four children - tried to flee out a back door.

'She was running, and we caught her,' police spokesman Jim Daly told the Washington Post.

After authorities discovered the grisly crime scene, neighbors told authorities that they heard loud noises coming from the home the previous evening, but did not call police.

The injured children were taken to Children's Hospital in northwest Washington, where they are being treated for their injuries.
