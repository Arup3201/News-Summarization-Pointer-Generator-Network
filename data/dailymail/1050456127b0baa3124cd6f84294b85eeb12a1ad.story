British woman Joy Williams died from an infection following a buttock enlargement operation in Thailand 10 days ago

Thousands of women are ‘taking a big gamble’ with their lives by going overseas for cheap buttock implant operations, leading surgeons have warned.

Popularity of buttock enlargement operations is said to have soared - with the trend said to be partly fuelled by young women trying to replicate the curvy figure of reality star Kim Kardashian.

One surgeon said the number of those having the operation had risen by 150 per cent in the past decade.

But Harley Street practitioner Dr Douglas Harrison urged women to be cautious about travelling abroad for the operation - saying their lives could be put at risk by unscrupulous providers.

He spoke out after British woman Joy Williams, 23, died 10 days ago from infection after travelling from London to Thailand for a £2,000 buttock augmentation procedure.

Dr Harrison, a member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said that using a reputable surgeon in the UK will still only cost a four-figure sum.

He said: ‘Buttock augmentation is perfectly safe if done properly, with a pretty low complication rate.

‘But if you do it in the backstreets for a cheaper rate, you are taking a big gamble.

‘Surgery in the UK with a reputable surgeon should certainly cost less than £10,000. It depends on the size of implants.’

Reality television show star Kim Kardashian, 34, is reported to have her behind insured for £13 million although she denies having it surgically-enhanced.

Dr Harrison said that he has been carrying out buttock implants for the last 15 to 20 years and when he first started, people were having the procedure ‘mostly for medical reasons’ such as muscle-wasting conditions.

‘Now it’s roughly a 70:30 ratio in favour of cosmetic surgery,’ he said.

‘It used to be a South American and African thing - in the southern hemisphere, they like shapely buttocks rather than large breasts - whereas in northern countries, the trend used to be the other way round.’ 

He believes the change started with the popularity of R&B and hip hop music videos featuring glamorous, scantily clad women with big behinds, and actresses such as Jennifer Lopez - before Kardashian’s booty stole the limelight.

According to one plastic surgery firm, Longevita, 45 per cent of women asking for bottom-enhancing procedures in the last year have demanded ‘The Kim’.

As well as female clients, Dr Harrison’s practice also attracts a large interest from gay men, who account for up to half of enquiries for buttock augmentation.

Dr Harrison says there are two safe procedures - injecting body fat or inserting silicone implants - but warns ‘not to touch with a barge pole’ a third option, liquid silicone injections.

Silicone injections are illegal in the UK and US but are still being performed in poorer countries - at huge cost.

In 2012/13, 17 women in Venezuela died from the toxic injections.

Even conventional surgery is not without dangers.

‘The risk comes from the fact that the incision for implants is close to the anus and there is always a risk of infection however much cleaning and washing you do,’ Dr Harrison says.

While none of his patients has ever suffered infection, Dr Harrison warns: ‘If you go abroad for a cheap operation, hygiene standards vary considerably.’

Another expert, Dr Graeme Perks, president of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons, adds: ‘There is also the fact that no silicone implant lasts forever.

‘Anyone contemplating buttock implants has to ask themselves whether they want to go ahead knowing they will have to have another operation to take them out a few years later.

‘I would advise against going outside the EU for a cheaper operation because you do not know what the quality of silicone implants will be.

‘And if things go wrong, people are asking why the NHS should pick up the bill for treating complications.’

No figures are available for admissions to NHS hospitals due to infected buttock implants.

But even life-threatening infection fails to put off some women.

Glamour model Mia Maffia, 23, went abroad for surgery because it was half the £7,000 price quoted in the UK - but one of her implants burst 10 days later leaving ‘litres of blood and pus oozing out of my buttocks’.

Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary had no choice but to remove the implants - although Miss Maffia begged them not to.

She said: ‘I wanted a new bum so badly, at that point I’d have preferred the fever and pain over losing my perfect bum. But the surgeons had no choice. To save my life, the implants had to come out.’

But while still in hospital recovering, Miss Maffia asked a friend to book an operation to have a replacement pair of implants.
