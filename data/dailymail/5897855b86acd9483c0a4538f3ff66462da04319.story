UNITE Union General Sec. Len McCluskey is set to demand Labour rejects austerity ahead of next year's election

The Unite union will issue an extraordinary list of demands to Ed Miliband next week in a bid to drive Labour further to the Left.

Members of the union, Labour’s biggest donor, will meet in Liverpool on Monday for a week-long conference.

Leader Len McCluskey is set to demand Labour rejects austerity ahead of next year’s election. 

A draft 
agenda reveals activists expect a clear return on the £16.2million Unite
 has given Labour since the last election, with proposals to lower the 
pension age, abolish anti-strike laws and spend tens of billions 
nationalising parts of the private sector.

Labour is also urged to reject fracking for gas.

One motion says: ‘The Labour Party is our party, it was formed by the trade union movement and we will not be pushed out.’

Activists want to cut donations by 20 per cent unless all the Coalition’s spending cuts are reversed.

Senior
 Labour figures, such as health spokesman Andy Burnham, will attend the 
event weeks before the party’s National Policy Forum meets to agree the 
outline of its election manifesto.

Mr Miliband has already accepted some Unite demands, such as new rent controls and a higher top tax rate.
