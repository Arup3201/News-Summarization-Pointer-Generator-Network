A mother-of-four who was killed in a car crash alongside two of her children, predicted her own death would occur on the very road that she lost her life.

Keisha Ann Jackson, from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, had been driving along Glenview Road with her four children on Friday night when her car slid off the wet road and slammed into a tree.

The 30-year-old died at the scene alongside her son Ryan Jackson-Cooke, 10, and her daughter Joan Jackson, 7, according to Queensland Police.

Ryan and another child, four-year-old Matilda Jackson-Cooke, were found in the grass nearby and appeared to have been thrown from the vehicle upon impact. While Ryan did not survive his sister is currently still in a critical condition at the Royal Brisbane Hospital according to police.

In the wake of the tragic incident, Ms Jackson's best friend, Krystal Percival, told the Sunday Mail that Ms Jackson had expressed grave concern about driving along the very road she died on.

'She told me "One of these days I’m going to die on this corner",' Ms Percival, 27, said.

Since news of the accident spread, family and friends have expressed their shock over the incident.

Two of Ms Jackson's children died at the scene. Her oldest son Ethan, 11, managed to escape with only minor injuries while her youngest child, Matilda, 4,died in hospital

'I wished this has never happened to you I hope I will see you in the next life in the spirit world and your kids as well. You will always be in my heart for ever,' Amanda Lando wrote on Facebook.

Ms Jackson's eldest child, 11-year-old Ethan Jackson miraculously managed to survive the crash. He only sustained minor injuries according to police, and was discharged from hospital on Saturday.

The 11-year-old managed to escape the wreck after the accident and flag down a car that was passing by, Verena Hart, an aged care nurse who had been passing by at the time, told the Northern Star.

Ethan was covered in blood, grass and mud when he flagged down some cars for help, according to witnesses, before he led them back to the scene were his mother (pictured) and siblings had been killed

'He was covered in blood and grass and mud, he was all dazed and confused,' she said.Ms Hart, Ethan and a policeman that he’d managed to flag down, then went to find the wreckage together in the dark.

It was then that they found seven-year-old Joan, caught in her seat belt and barely breathing at the scene that Ms Hart described as appearing 'like a bomb had gone off'.

She was unable to be saved by paramedics and died at the scene.

Forensic investigators are still looking into the incident, and are considering the issues of speed and seatbelts.
