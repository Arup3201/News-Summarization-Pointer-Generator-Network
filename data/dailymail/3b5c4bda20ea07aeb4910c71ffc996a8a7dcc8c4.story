'Filthy': Isabell Telford, pictured, said that her new flat, owned by East Lothian Council, was 'not fit for human habitation' when she moved in

A mother-of-three claimed a council official told her to 'find herself a man' when she complained that work needed to be done to her new home.

Isabell Telford was appalled when she moved into a flat in Newbigging, Musselburgh, earlier this year, describing it as 'filthy' and 'not fit for human habitation'.

The 40-year-old said that the property, owned by East Lothian Council, had exposed pipes in the bathroom, tiles ripped off the walls and peeling wallpaper. 

She added that nails sticking up from the floorboards and the broken fence in the roof garden made it a dangerous place for her one-year-old grandson. 

When she complained to the council, Ms Telford was told that she would have to carry out repairs herself.

But after she pointed out that she was not physically able to complete all the work, the council official told her that she should 'go get herself a man'.

Ms Telford, who works night shifts as a carer and is also a PA during the day, claimed she has also been told by council workers give up work and go on benefits in order to get charity white goods for her home. 

She said: 'There was a council worker here, I can't remember if he was surveyor or what but I was asking him how he expected me to physically do some of the repairs needed.

'He said I should go and get myself a man for a couple of months to get it done.

'He started laughing but I told him I didn't find it funny at all.'

Ms Telford moved into the flat with her sons Jordan, 17, and Daniel, 16, in May and claims it has taken her five months and hundreds of phone calls to get the council to eventually carry out some of the repairs need.

She said: 'When I first saw the flat, coming in the door I was in tears. I said I would rather sleep in a tent outside with my bairns than sleep in here.

'It was filthy, it was stinking, it was not fit for human habitation but I had no choice but to take it.

Dingy: Ms Telford said that the wallpaper in her flat in Newbigging, Musselburgh, was peeling off the walls when she moved into the flat earlier this year. She claimed it has taken months to have the repairs made

Run-down: Paint was peeling off from the walls, left, and pipes in the bathroom had been left exposed. The mother-of-three, who moved in with two of her children, said she was left in 'tears' when she first saw the flat

'Horrendous': Ms Telford said that tiles on the bathroom wall had fallen off and had not been fixed. When she told council officials that she could not carry out the repairs herself, they told her to 'get herself a man'

'It was horrendous.'

She said she was unable to look after her grandson Kye for her daughter Sarah, 23, for two weeks after she moved in due to the nails sticking up from the floorboards.

Ms Telford said when she was offered the house she and her family were homeless and living in temporary accommodation in Tranent, East Lothian, after being forced to move from their previous private let when it was sold.

Squalid: Damp on the walls and uneven floorboards made the property 'dangerous' for Ms Telford's one-year-old grandson, she said. She claimed council bosses also told her to stop working and collect benefits

She said: 'I just felt because I was homeless I was treated like scum. That's how it made me feel.

'Just because I've been in homeless accommodation doesn't make me scum. I work and I work hard and I've never been on benefits.

'I always knew the council was bad but I didn't think it was this bad.'

An East Lothian Council spokeswoman said she could not discuss individual cases.
