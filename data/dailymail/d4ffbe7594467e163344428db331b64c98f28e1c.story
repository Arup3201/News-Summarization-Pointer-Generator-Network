A fierce supermarket price war has made it possible to put a Christmas turkey with all the trimmings on the table this year for just £2.66 per person.

Shopping around for the best deals among the ten biggest chains could deliver a meal that costs £21.31 for a family of eight – 53p less than last year.

If you opt to go to only one outlet, then Iceland wins on cost. Their basket came in at £27.83 with Lidl second at £28.13, Morrisons third at £29.12 and Aldi costing £32.06.

Christmas dinner with all the trimmings could cost as little as £2.66 a person after a fierce supermarket price war

The rise of the discount chains has dragged mainstream stores into a price war that has delivered real savings on everyday essentials, such as milk, bread and eggs.

However, the battle has now been spread to the most important meal of the year and includes fresh vegetables, Christmas pudding and brandy butter.

The price comparison was made by the Good Housekeeping Institute which has been monitoring prices since 2009 when the cheapest selection of ingredients came in at £3 per head, or £24. 

Consumer director at Good Housekeeping, Caroline Bloor, said: ‘It’s a constant struggle for many to keep family food bills under control, but the current battle between the traditional supermarkets and the discounters is pulling prices down for everyone – and will continue to do so.

‘Even at the most expensive supermarkets there are still bargains to be found, for example Waitrose’s Christmas cake is 49p cheaper than Aldi’s and the cost of potatoes and carrots is broadly the same across all retailers.

‘It’s a real time of change, and we’ll be monitoring it closely to see who’s really focused on the customer.’

It said the cheapest turkey that is big enough to feed eight was the frozen Braemoor self-basting bird from Lidl, which was £9.99 at the time the survey was done. The firm’s website now offers a small frozen Braemoor turkey at £8.99, which is up to 4kg, while a medium bird of up to 5.4kg is £10.99.

The next biggest expense was a family size Christmas cake which came in at £3 from Iceland for a large iced fruit bar of 800g.

While Iceland is known predominantly for its frozen food, it also sells the normal range of fresh produce and Christmas products.

The chain is making a determined attempt to attract more middle Britain shoppers with some more upmarket special deals, such as a whole cooked lobster for just £5

The company’s Deluxe Mince Pies at £1.50 for a pack were recently named the best on the high street, even beating products costing more than eight times as much from Fortnum & Mason and Harrods.

The pies were praised for being ‘generously filled with sweet, fruity mincemeat’, while the pastry was described as buttery and crumbly.

Aldi supplied the cheapest sprouts at 49p for 750g, while its carrots were best value at 49p for 1.2kg. Lidl and Aldi had the cheapest Brandy butter at £1.49 for 200g.

Tesco was best for parsnips at 90p for 750g and its Everyday Value cranberry sauce was just 50p for 185g. The Co-op was best for potatoes at £1.50 for a 1.5kg bag of Maris Piper.

The Sainsbury’s Basics range provided two 454g Christmas puddings for £2 and eight puff pastry mince pies at 65p for a pack of eight.

The price battle for customers has also delivered savings at the quality end of the Christmas food table. The figure for Marks & Spencer is down from £51.29 to £47.04, while Waitrose is down from £53.15 to £41.05.

Given the cut-throat nature of the battle for festive food sales, there is every chance that prices will change – and fall further – through special promotions in the coming weeks.
