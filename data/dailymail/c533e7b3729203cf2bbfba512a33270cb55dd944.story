Britain’s miserable slump into autumnal weather just over a week after a 30C heatwave continued today as the country faced blustery showers and rain.

The Met Office placed much of Scotland and Northern Ireland under a ‘be aware’ weather warning for high winds yesterday - and warned of 50mph gusts today.

The coldest place in England yesterday was Hurn in Dorset, at 2.2C, but the chilliest area of Britain was Bala in Gwynedd, north Wales, where it was 1.6C.

Good morning: This was another spectacular scene today as the sun rises over Malmesbury, Wiltshire. The coldest place in England last night was Hurn in Dorset, at 2.2C

Beautiful start: Any lingering overnight rain will clear south-west England on Wednesday morning. The sunrise in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, is pictured

The average night-time temperature for
September is 9C. But overnight temperatures for England over the next 
few days are forecast to be as low as 6C.

Last night it was expected to be drier in the South-East, but thickening cloud 
will bring rain and drizzle to Wales and the South-West in the early 
hours.

Today, Scotland 
will be breezy with sunny spells and showers, while it will be cloudy 
and unsettled elsewhere in Britain with rain spreading north-east.

If you like Pina Colada: Londoners and tourists alike were caught in heavy rain this afternoon as the summer came to a definite end for the capital

And getting caught in the rain: Some unfortunate had not thought to bring an umbrella on their day out in the capital and were subsequently soaked as they crossed the Thames

Lots of soggy bottoms: The capital was caught out when the heavens opened and visitors of the London sights got to experience true British weather

London Bridge is pouring down: The heavy rain made it difficult to look further down the Thames than Tower bridge as London was hit by heavy rain

Power of the wind: The strong winds took down a tree which blocke traffic on the busy A37 on the Mendip Hills in Somerset

Roadblock: The huge tree lay in pieces following severe high winds in the region

Wrapped up warm: Hill runner David Herbertson was pictured on Cairngorm Mountain in the Scottish Highlands today, where there was a fresh dusting of snow

Chilly: Matt Rice was pictured walking on Cairngorm Mountain today after there was a fresh dusting of snow. The top wind speed last night was 65mph at Aonach Mor

Someone forgot their umbrella: Members of the public are pictured in the heavy rain in Central London this afternoon, as Britain's slump towards the autumn continues

Far from pleasant conditions: Umbrellas were turned inside out and members of the public ran to escape the heavy rain in Central London this afternoon

The rain will ease across Northern Ireland during the late afternoon, but it will be very windy in south-west England and along English Channel coasts.

Any lingering overnight rain will clear south-west England on Wednesday to leave a bright day across the UK with sunny intervals and variable cloud.

Rain and drizzle looks set to move south-eastwards over the UK on Thursday - mostly light and patchy - but north-west Scotland will see heavier bursts.

Forecast: Tomorrow, Scotland will be breezy with sunny spells and showers, while it will be cloudy and unsettled elsewhere in Britain with rain spreading north-east

Met Office forecaster Lindsay Mears told MailOnline yesterday: ‘Tomorrow we've got an Atlantic front moving in which will bring more rain to areas, making it unsettled and unpleasant.

'The temperatures are slightly lower than average for September, but it is autumnal weather. It's just a change of season'

Lindsay Mears, Met Office forecaster

‘Tomorrow winds of up to 50mph are possible, but they are more likely to be 40mph. We have a North-South split. It's actually going to improve in the North and get worse in the South.’

She added: ‘It's going to be wetter in the South and drier in the North as the week progresses.

'Temperatures will be struggling into the teens unfortunately. The temperatures are slightly lower than average for September, but it is autumnal weather. It's just a change of season.

The Environment Agency issued a flood alert for the North Somerset coastline between Gore Point and Hurlstone Point, including Porlock Weir. The top wind speed last night was 65mph at Aonach Mor, near Fort William in Scotland.

Whooper swans have started arriving at a wildlife reserve a week earlier than usual - suggesting Britain will have a freezing winter, according to folklore.

Two of the swans arrived at the Ouse Washes in Welney, Cambridgeshire, last Friday - but are normally seen at the end of September.

The adult birds were spotted at the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust reserve, which holds the UK’s largest roost of whooper and Bewick’s swans.

It is the third year the swans have arrived early - and the last two years have seen freezing winters, with some of the coldest weather in a century.

‘The first whooper swans were spotted on Friday, which is around a week earlier than normal,’ said Leigh Marshall, centre manager at WWT Welney.

‘They have had a colder than average year in Iceland where they breed and there was a north westerly wind last week which brought them over.

‘Their early arrival suggests we are in for a cold winter, according to folklore. It has certainly proved correct the last two years.’

Journey: Each year the whooper swans migrate more than 1,200 miles from their breeding grounds in Iceland to arrive at their winter refuge

Each year the whooper swans migrate more than 1,200 miles from their breeding grounds in Iceland to arrive at their winter refuge.

Mid-winter, there can be up to 5,000 at Welney. Whooper swans make the longest overseas direct flight of any swan species.

This includes a 700-mile ocean crossing over the North Atlantic. The whooper swans can complete this journey across the water in as little as 13 hours.

They make the journeys with their young who can be as little as 12 weeks old. On the way they have to cope with extreme weather and avoid hunters.
