The Danny Welbeck fan club used to seem a little short of members. There was Sir Alex Ferguson, Roy Hodgson, a handful of Manchester United fans, me… and that was pretty much it.

But now Louis van Gaal is prepared to let Welbeck leave Old Trafford, that little club has grown somewhat. It now includes Arsene Wenger, Mauricio Pochettino, Roberto Martinez, Alan Pardew, Gus Poyet, Steve Bruce and Cesare Prandelli, the Galatasaray manager.

All of those well-respected bosses now want the 23-year-old forward at their clubs, and I have yet to meet a fan of any of these teams who thinks otherwise. The Welbeck fan club is swelling fast, and with good reason.

Wanted: Danny Welbeck is in demand with Premier League clubs with his future uncertain at Old Trafford

At a stretch: The United forward in action after coming on as a substitute at Sunderland last Sunday

Welbeck is a young English striker of huge potential. He is a supreme athlete – extremely fast thanks to his long strides, and strong enough to hold off the toughest defenders in world football. 

Anyone who saw him shirtless on Copacabana before the World Cup will know that his body is the ideal shape for a modern footballer, a physique as impressive even as Cristiano Ronaldo’s.

He is also blessed with quick feet, technical agility and ability rarely seen in English strikers, and the ambition to attempt the audacious – witness his sublime chipped finish on the opening day of last season against Swansea.

He is a fine link player, plays with his head up, is always looking to bring others into the game and for quick one-twos on the edge of the box.

Bags packed? Welbeck wants regular starts and could be ready to quit United to find it

Strikes: Positions from which Welbeck scored his goals in the Premier League last season

He was thrust into the limelight when Ferguson shunted Wayne Rooney aside for the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid in February last year, and then dropped his big name star for the second leg. United lost the tie after Nani’s red card but Welbeck scored in the Bernabeu and bullied the likes of Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane.

A star was born or, at least, it should have been. Despite that sparkling introduction to the game’s biggest stage, Welbeck has not established himself at United and is on the verge of leaving the club.

He is loved by some United fans for being a Manchester born-and-bred product of the youth system, a supporter of the club who never fails to give it all to the cause, even if that means a defensive-minded shift on the left wing. 

Other United fans simply see him as not progressing as a player and another symbol of the post-Ferguson mess Van Gaal finds himself in.

To many other fans he is a laughing stock, a striker with a woeful goalscoring record who should never be near the England team. The next Emile Heskey, even (although this opinion seems to dissipate when Welbeck is linked with their club).

Withdrawn: Welbeck's average position on the pitch last season was behind the main striker

It can’t be denied that Welbeck’s goalscoring record is extremely disappointing for an international forward. In 117 appearances in the Premier League over his career to date, he has scored just 26 goals - a strike-rate of 0.2 goals per game with 262 minutes played per goal. 

He can look lost when he sees the whites of goalkeepers’ eyes – just ask Manuel Neuer after last season’s Champions League quarter-final first leg when Welbeck fluffed a glorious one-one-one chance. 

He has also been criticised – most notably by Thierry Henry on the BBC during the World Cup - for taking the easy options, playing safe passes instead of using his pace, power and vision to punch holes in the opposition. All are valid criticisms and Welbeck must improve these areas of the game.

But how is a striker supposed to become more clinical in front of goal when he is shunted on the wing, seeing even fewer sights of goal, and asked to graft in a role almost more defensive than attacking, as David Moyes asked of him last season?

When Moyes did play him further as a striker, Welbeck's goals per games ratio dramatically improved, and he scored six goals in six Premier League matches in a run between December 2013 and January 2014.

The only way Welbeck will truly realise his potential is to start games, up front or as a No 10, on a regular basis. And he need look no further than Daniel Sturridge for proof.

Sturridge, now 24, is becoming a superstar at Liverpool following four years in the doldrums at Chelsea. He too was shunted wide to play in a role that blunted his talents, or as a substitute, cast in the shadow of Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres just as Welbeck is with Rooney and Robin van Persie.

Going nowhere: Daniel Sturridge was a lost talent at Chelsea until he moved to Liverpool

Hotshot: Sturridge is now one of the most feared strikers in the Premier League and England's No 9 

At Chelsea, Sturridge scored just 13 times in 63 Premier League appearances - a strike rate of 0.2 goals per game (just like Welbeck now) and averaging a goal every 220 minutes. Last season he netted 21 goals - behind only Suarez in the goalscorers’ charts - and is England’s undisputed No 9.

Welbeck can similarly flourish if given the opportunity elsewhere and that is why his fan club now includes the likes of Wenger. 

Manchester City and their embarrassment of riches apart, Welbeck would improve the strikeforce of every single Premier League club. Buy him while you can.
