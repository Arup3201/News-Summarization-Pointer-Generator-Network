To live in Australia is to experience the devastating fury of bushfires, meaning nearly every single Australian is affected by the firefighters who fight to keep us safe.

An SBS documentary airing this week gives a glimpse into the incredible life of a firefighter - including heart pumping Go-Pro footage from the helmet of a Rural Fire Service volunteer, running through smoke with flames licking at his heels.

Australia has the largest firefighting force in the world with a volunteer army of over 200,000 - double that of the military. 

More than a million Australians have built homes in fire zone areas.  

2013 was the hottest year on record and on the verge of another sweltering summer, firefighters will be on call to save not only Australian homes, but also our lives.

Astonishingly the men and women that put their lives on the line for our are largely unpaid volunteers.

‘Many people still believe firefighters get paid. They don’t realise that they do it for free,’ Ben Shepherd, a volunteer firefighter of more than 20 years.

‘There is such a huge mix of people that volunteer with the fire service. The value of the volunteers cannot be measured.' 

‘We’re very fortunate to the time and effort given by thousands of volunteers. Their time would be worth billions of dollars if they were to be paid.’

Many people are unaware that most firefighters are unpaid and are also 'lawyers, butchers, doctors, chefs – even the Prime Minister is a volunteer with the rural service'

People are unaware that underneath the fireman’s suit, there very well could be another uniform from the volunteer’s day job.

‘Sometimes it’s a surprise for people to find out that the firefighter may well be a lawyer, butcher, doctor, chef – even our Prime Minister is a volunteer with the rural service.’

NSW Rural Fire Service Inspector Ben Shepherd was a volunteer for 20 years before he joined the service in a paid media role.

‘I have been very lucky to turn a hobby in a career. I absolutely love working here. You’re working with people that want to work here so much that they come for free.’

Mr Shepherd says that after every major fire, they are inundated by people wanting to volunteer, which makes it such an enjoyable place to work

Mr Shepherd says that after every major fire, they are inundated by people throwing their hands up to volunteer, which illustrates the spirit of the service.

When fires ripped through Mr Shepherd’s neighbourhood in 1994, he felt the pull to join the rural fire service.

‘I had family that were members are after that event, they told me to come and check it out,’ said Mr Shepherd.

‘I’ve never looked back.’

Since he joined, Mr Shepherd has been involved fighting fires all around New South Wales, working with various brigades.

The Rural Fire Service is able to assist a staggering 95 per cent of the vast state.

Australians may also be unaware that the title ‘firefighters’ is deceiving – there is much more to the job description.

‘It’s an absolutely amazing service. It’s not just bush fires, there are also house fires, motor vehicle access after car accidents, helping in search and rescues… Ways to help the community.’

Mr Shepherd is passionate about fighting fires, but admits there are moments of fear when facing a raging, unpredictable wall of fire.

‘There are definitely times when there’s the possibility the fire will do damage and the potential of being injured or killed.

As well as fighting house and bushfires, firefighters offer assistance during car accidents, search and rescues and other situations where the community need aid

‘In the Christmas fires of 2001 and 2002 there were times standing in the backyard of a property in a valley with a fast-moving fire moving towards you.

‘That was confronting, there’s adrenaline involved in that.’

In the heat of the moment, the RFS training and years of experience kick in – as does the instinctual ‘survival mode’.

‘In those incidents, your mind quickly clicks back to the training and past experiences fighting fires. You also have your team members around you.

‘But when the fire is crowning towards you with huge amounts of heat, you are thinking “Am I in a safe spot? Can I get out of it?”’

Men and women of all ages are involved with the fire service, and all are welcome. Any possible time they have to volunteer is appreciated

There is a great sense of community within the Rural Fire Service, with many volunteers making steadfast friends for life

‘You need to ensure that your life comes first and that you know when to step back.’

The challenge is that nature is completely unpredictable and despite years of experience, a firefighter must always be on alert.

‘When you’re relaxed, a fire will catch you out,’ said Mr Shepherd.

‘Every fire is different. There are always complex issues around them, like the vegetation or their location which changes how the fire behaves.’

‘They all react in their own unique way. You are always learning.’

Working as a firefighter isn’t just a physical job.

One of the most important parts of the role is being a pillar of strength to people affected by the devastation of a bushfire or another tragedy. 

‘We can be a comforter to someone going through the worst day of their life.

‘We help how we can – if it’s holding a drip during a car accident when someone is trapped inside their vehicle or giving someone advice about how to deal with incoming fire,’ said Mr Shepherd.

While these tasks may seem daunting, Mr Shepherd says it is enormously gratifying.

‘Everyone gets a sense of reward through things.

There are times when I have stopped and thought to myself, “you know, I really love this.””

Surprisingly, there are also a large number of animals who benefit from the RFS.

Firefighters saving cats from trees is certainly not a myth – it is a very regular occurrence.

'The most unusual job was saving a horse stuck in a pool. 

'We had to calm down a horse while it was standing in a backyard pool, it was definitely the most unusual call I've had!'

There are many jobs available for volunteers in the RFS, with jobs that are just as important behind the scenes including administration and administration, training and courses such as First Aid

'If you are thinking of doing it, do it,' advises Mr Shepherd. 

'Whatever time you can donate, you're welcome with the RFS. 

'They are always happy to recruit and train more volunteers.'
