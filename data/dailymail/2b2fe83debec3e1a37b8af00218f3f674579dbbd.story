Two million Britons regularly lie about their weekends to make them sound more interesting, a survey has found.

Most of us waste our weekends, only making the most of 20 of them a year, according to a survey released today.

And around 2.5 million lie about their weekend plans to sound more interesting, rather than tackling the problem head on.

Catching up on sleep: 2.5million Britains waste their weekends, then lie about what they did to make it sound more interesting

Two thirds of us say our weekends are a let-down and almost one in three regret that we have not done anything interesting come Sunday night.

And respondents claimed, on average, to spend a whole day - nearly nine hours - of every weekend in front of a TV or computer screen and admit to a £600 yearly spend on weekend alcohol.

This is in contrast to our European cousins, who can be found going to restaurants, parties, shopping, or soaking up museum culture at the weekend.

One in five of us regret not having made the most of the weekend, rising to almost one third of people who live in London, yet it’s not disposable income that’s the problem, but how we choose to spend our well-earned cash.

Party time: Brits surveyed on made the most of 20 weekends a year

Brits are most likely to spend their weekends:

* Watching TV (34 per cent)

* Catching up on sleep (27 per cent)

* Cleaning the house (11 per cent)

* Doing ‘life’ admin (8 per cent)

* Getting drunk (5 per cent)

One in four say they can’t afford a weekend break between now and Christmas but on average they are spending £600 on alcohol a year just on weekends alone - enough for a three night city break in New York or around 20 trips to the theatre.

Mark Maddock, Managing Director of lastminute.com UK and Ireland, which carried out the survey, said: 'We all enjoy relaxing and doing nothing from time to time but it’s clear that too much down time leaves people looking back on their weekends with regret.

'When work requires us to plan and stick to schedules there is a natural urge to totally kick back at weekends.'
