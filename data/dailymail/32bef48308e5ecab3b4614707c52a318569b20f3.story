Hannah Miley admits she was still suffering from her gruelling gold medal win after qualifying for the Commonwealth Games women's 200 metres breaststroke final at Tollcross in Glasgow.

The Scot won gold in the 400m individual medley on Thursday and will have another chance at a medal on Saturday night after clocking 2mins 28.22 seconds when finishing third in her heat as England's Molly Renshaw turned out the second fastest time of 2:25.75.

Afterwards Miley, seventh fastest out of eight, said: 'I was shot. I was completely knackered. It has been a whirlwind.

'It has gone so quick. I haven't had the time to reflect but I am really happy with the way things are going.

'However, I am aware that I have a job at hand with the rest of my races, the competition isn't finished yet so I have to keep myself in a bubble and try not to get too excited.

'I got through to the final, I went in ranked tenth so to make the final was going to be pretty tough and now that I have, it is a huge bonus.

'The next couple of races is trying to make finals and progress with personal bests.

'That time was a season's best I think so I'm really happy with that and hope to make it into a PB for the final so we'll see how that goes.

'It's about staying relaxed, enjoying the racing, enjoying the crowd.

'The hard work was done on day one so now it is trying to take every opportunity I have to progress.

'I get to enjoy myself after next Tuesday.'

Earlier, Scotland's Cameron Brodie went clear in the second heat of the men's 200m butterfly at the halfway mark and retained his lead to win in the fastest qualifying time of 1:57.28.

Roberto Pavoni of England also made it into Saturday night's final as last of the eight qualifiers.
