A ferry full of summer vacationers returning to Boston from Cape Cod was stranded Wednesday after the boat was hit with a huge wave that came out of nowhere.

Video of the aftermath shows the 42 passengers and crew frantically rushing to put on life jackets as water streams in from the ceiling and onto the floor of the boat.

One woman can be heard saying 'the boat is sinking'.

Passengers say the ocean was not unusually choppy Wednesday afternoon, when a green sheet of water hit the boat - causing the most damage on the captain's level, 20 feet above water. The ferry was nearing Boston, and just north of Scituate, around 4pm when the incident happened,

'People started getting life vests on, and people were crying and throwing up,' Ariel Shrum, 22, told NECN.

The wave broke seven windows on the Providence IV ferry, operated by the Bay State Cruise Company, and even caused the boat's control systems to go off line.

Seven windows on the vessel were also broken by the wave and the captain sustained a minor injury to his hand

'When the wave broke the windows, the vessel's control systems went off line for a period of time. The captain was able to bring the starboard engine up to speed but not the port engine,' the Bay State Cruise company said in a statement.

The ferry contacted the Coast Guard which sent out two vessels to aid the stranded ferry.

While the passengers waited for Coast Guard to arrive, Shrum, a Berklee College of Music student, soothed tensions by playing his trumpet. (He also plays in a band called The Interlopers.)

'I played a lot of ocean-themed stuff,' he told the Boston Globe. 'I played "Jaws," actually, just as a joke.'

Once the Coast Guard arrived, the boats engines were put back online and the ferry was able to sail to Boston harbor on its own power. The boat made port around 7pm, three hours after the incident. The ferry from Provincetown to Boston usually takes just 90 minutes.

The captain was the only person on the boat injured, and he was taken away in an ambulance after to treat a minor hand injury

'We can only imagine the amount of concern and alarm that the passengers must have felt when the vessel decelerated so suddenly and then had to wait until the propulsion came back on line,' ferry company owner Michael Glasfeld said in a statement.

'It is this that we are most focused on; the experience and safety of our passengers and our sincere regrets over having subjected them to this experience.'
