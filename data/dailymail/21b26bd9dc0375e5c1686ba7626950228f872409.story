Tana Ramsay joined her husband at the High Court in London today (above) where she said a family feud with her father had been 'distressing' 

Gordon Ramsay's wife spoke yesterday about the family feud between her husband and father, calling the fight 'extremely distressing'.

Tana Ramsay told a judge that her 'dominant' father Christopher Hutcheson had 'systematically defrauded' the chef during his time as chief executive of Gordon Ramsay Holdings.

Mrs Ramsay was speaking at a civil claim made by her husband, who is trying to avoid being held liable for the £640,000 annual rent on a London pub bought when Mr Hutcheson was at the helm of the company.

Mr Ramsay has accused Mr Hutcheson of using a ghostwriter machine, more commonly used by authors to sign books and photographs automatically, to forge his signature on a document which made Mr Ramsay the personal guarantor for the costly rent of the exclusive the York & Albany .

Mrs Ramsay, 40, who married the chef in 1996 and has four children with him, said: 'The knowledge that my father and brother had been systematically defrauding my husband was extremely distressing to me.'

She added: 'My father was someone, in my opinion, who was very, very clever at times at giving enough information to satisfy, but never all.

'I think certainly when Gordon asked questions or sort of wanted to know things, sometimes it would be a case of my father keeping him incredibly busy or out of the country with not enough time to be told everything.'

Asked by the judge if her father gave the impression that 'Gordon doesn't understand these things and trusts me to look after the financial side', Mrs Ramsay replied: 'Yes, my lord, that would be true.'

Mr Ramsay turned the property, owned by film director Gary Love, into a hotel, pub and restaurant. Mr Love has described the chef's attempt to have the signature discarded as 'absurd'.

Telling the court she was aware of the ghostwriting machine which could reproduce the chef's signature, Mrs Ramsay added: 'It did not even occur to me that the machine might be used to sign Gordon's signature on anything else.' 

But she recalled 'the shock on Gordon's face' when the couple's solicitor Larry Nathan, who works for the law firm Mishcon de Reya, told him that the lease for the York & Albany included a clause which would make him the personal guarantor for the rent on the property for 25 years.

Mrs Ramsay went on to say that her husband said the lease 'takes everything we have ever worked for'.

Mr Hutcheson acted as business manager for the Ramsay group of companies until the chef sacked him and Tana's brother, Adam, on the grounds of gross misconduct in 2010.

Mrs Ramsay, who also writes cookery books and runs a beauty salon, said she felt that the business had improved since her father and brother left their positions in the firm.

She added: 'Since the departure of my father and my brother from the business it has been a huge upheaval, but certainly myself I feel very comfortable with what the company has become.

'Whilst not immediately, it is certainly more transparent and it is on a much more solid basis.' Speaking about her family's estrangement, she said: 'I don't really speak to my father since he left the company unless it is concerning his grandchildren – we certainly don't have any comfortable conversations.'
