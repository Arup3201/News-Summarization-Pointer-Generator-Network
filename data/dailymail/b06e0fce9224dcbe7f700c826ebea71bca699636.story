A co-founder of the frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry has been sentenced to seven years in prison for beating a homeless man with a tire iron in Los Angeles.

Forty-nine-year-old millionaire, Young Lee, who is no longer affiliated with Pinkberry, was sentenced to the maximum term Friday.

A jury convicted Lee of assault with a deadly weapon last November and the judge declared him to be a significant threat to the community.

Guilty: The co-founder of frozen yogurt giant Pinkberry was convicted of beating a homeless man with a tire iron last year, while the victim

No fro-yo for him: The co-founder of frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry was sentenced Friday to a maximum seven years in prison for beating a panhandling homeless man with a tire iron

Prosecutors said Lee confronted Daniel
 Bolding in June 2011 after the transient flashed a sexually explicit 
tattoo to several people in Lee's car, including his fiancee.

Words were exchanged, and Lee drove 
away, but came back with another man who'd been in the car and beat 
Bolding.Bolding was struck twice on the head and suffered a broken arm before witnesses stopped the attack.

Lee's defense attorney Philip Kent Cohen claimed the man made threats to his client as if he had a weapon, but police say it was a sexually explicit tattoo on the homeless man that triggered Lee to get out of his vehicle and go after the victim.

According to prosecutors, court documents show Lee viewed the tattoo as a sign of disrespect.

He
 demanded the homeless man kneel and apologize, but even after the man 
consented, police say Lee proceeded to kick and beat him with the tire 
iron.

Korean-born Young Lee began frozen yoghurt chain Pinkberry with his business partner Hye Kyung Hang in 2005 - and the brand has since grown from one store in Los Angeles to more than 100 across the country.Â 

The chain's rapid growth made Lee a wealthy man and he owned a luxury home with a fleet of luxury cars including a Rolls-Royce Phantom and Ferrari 599 GTB at the time of his arrest.

A number of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian number among Pinkberry's devoted fan following, and the company prides itself on having 'groupies' across the country.

Lee left the company in 2010.

Phillip Kent Cohen, Lee's attorney, said he and the prosecutor agreed on '96% of what happened: that there was a tire iron and that [Bolding] was given great bodily injury.'

But Cohen said his client never held the tire iron, and he attempted to cast doubt on the testimony of witnesses who identified Lee as the attacker, including saying that Bolding had 'flat-out lied.'

In the initial police report, Cohen said, Bolding alleged that he was arguing with the driver, whom he identified as Lee.

Bolding said the man in the passenger seat had the tire iron. But during the trial, Bolding testified that Lee had beaten him with the tire iron.

Bolding has also filed a personal injury lawsuit against Lee seeking damages for the attack.

After the beating, Lee traveled to Korea and England. He was arrested Jan. 30, 2012, at Los Angeles International Airport by a fugitive task force.

The jury deliberated for less than two days before reaching a guilty verdict in the three-week-long trial.

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Henry Hall said that evidence during the trial showed that Lee had made significant threats to witnesses and considered him a 'threat to the community.'

During the trial, the prosecutor reminded the jury of the threat to the witness, David Lee.

'Do you remember the moment when David Lee stood on the witness stand and told us he'd been threatened?'

Deputy Dist. Atty. Bobby Zoumberakis asked the jury Wednesday during closing arguments. ''I'm going to cut the throat of your mother, your wife, your daughter and you.' And remember how the air left the room because you could tell how scared David Lee was?'

Lee was arrested after a witness called police and gave the license plate number of the Range Rover involved, which was rented in Lee's name.

Lee, a kick-boxer-turned-architect-turned-entrepreneur, co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang.

They opened their first location in West Hollywood in 2005, gaining a celebrity following and sparking a frozen yoghurt craze.

The entrepreneur was previously sentenced to two days in jail and three years probation stemming from a cocaine charge and the carrying of a loaded firearm in 2001.

Lee now begins seven years in state prison although he has been behind bars since his conviction last year as he was not granted bail.
