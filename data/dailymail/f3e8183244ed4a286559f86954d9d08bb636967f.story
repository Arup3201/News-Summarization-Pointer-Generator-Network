Thieves have stripped lead from the roof of the church where the Bronte sisters are buried, causing thousands of pounds of damage to the historic building.

The Rev Peter Mayo-Smith, has told of his 'great sadness' and claims that they may now even have to think about different material for the roof to prevent further vandalism.

He also said that the raids on St Michael and All Angels Parish Church, where the Bronte sisters' father was once the reverend, may also have contributed the problems of a leaking roof which is causing religious paintings inside to 'literally start to disappear.'

Stealing history: St Michael and All Angels Parish Church, in Haworth, West Yorkshire where thieves have stripped lead from the roof

A £1.25 million scheme is about to start to restore the 1879 fabric of the West Yorkshire  churchbut its targeting may force English Heritage to replace the North and South roofs with something other than lead to deter the thieves.

Mr Mayo-Smith said: 'My response is one of great sadness because of the lack of respect it shows not just for churches but historic buildings in general.

'Other buildings in Howarth have also been attacked for lead including the local school and community centre.

'We have suffered at least three metal thefts in 18 months. They have stripped lead from the North and South roof and over the vestry. 

'As a result we have had quite significant amounts of water come into the building.

'The damage runs to tens of thousands of pounds for the roof alone whereas the scrap value will be in tens of pounds. 

He said the main church roof was very long and it would have been been very heavy for the thieves to carry out in one job.

He also told how the church had reached its insurance limit.

'For a large amount of effort for 
very little reward they have caused so much damage to our infrastructure
and the other damage is hard to put a figure on.'

Rain had been seeping into the building anyway because the roof was reaching the end of its life.

However,
three raids by metal thieves on the North and South roofs may have 
contributed to the water damage inside the church, he feared.

He said: 'The plaster is starting to fizz and you can see the damp and stains in the plaster work.'

It was also damaging Italian style paintings depicting Biblical stories which were put up on the walls.

He said: 'They are beautiful paintings but they are literally starting to disappear.'

The church is to close on July 8 for 15 weeks for the first stage of a £1.25 million scheme backed by English Heritage to completely restore the building, including the religious paintings.

It was in the hands of English Heritage and the architects whether lead was used for the roof or another material less attractive to thieves.

He said: 'It would be a great pity if it was not lead because it is traditional and we are in a heritage site.

'But metal theft has become endemic and reached the stage where it is damaging the whole country.'

The church's modern fame is chiefly due to its connections with the Brontë sisters and the link is what attracts thousands of visitors each year.

The Reverend Patrick Brontë, father of the authors, was the incumbent from 1820 to 1861.

He died in 1861 aged 84, having outlived his entire family and having served the Parish for 41 years.

Members of the family, including Emily and Charlotte, are buried in the family vault adjacent to the present south-east chapel.

There was a national outcry from Bronte enthusiasts in 1879 when it was decided to take down the old church building and build a new one.

However, the building was unsafe and unsanitary as water from that graveyard was seeping in through the floor, so the scheme went ahead.

However, the church remains as place of pilgrimage for visitors from all over the world.

Leaflets in the church have been translated into Japanese, Chinese and Korean.
