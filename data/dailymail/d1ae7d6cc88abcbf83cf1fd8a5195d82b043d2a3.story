George Osborne is standing behind his comments about Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls

George Osborne is refusing calls to apologise for saying Ed Balls had ‘questions to answer’ over the bank rate-fixing scandal.

Demands for an apology from the Chancellor were even backed by some senior Tories, including his predecessor Lord Lamont, who said Mr Osborne had ‘overplayed his hand’, adding: ‘If there is an allegation Ed Balls was involved, it doesn’t stand up. That is clear.’

Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, a member of the Commons Treasury Committee, triggered fury in the Treasury by saying Mr Osborne had clearly made a mistake and should now say sorry.

George Osborne had tried to link the 2008 rate-fixing scandal to his opposite number Mr Balls, who was a key figure in the Labour government at the time.

But Mrs Leadsom said evidence to MPs from Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker, who insisted there had been no pressure from Labour ministers to persuade banks to manipulate their rates, had ‘completely squashed’ Mr Osborne’s allegations.

Obviously he made a mistake and I think he should apologise,’ she told BBC Radio 4’s The World Tonight. ‘I think it was a very valid discussion at the time about who knew what and it has now been completely squashed by Paul Tucker.’

Labour Treasury spokesman Chris 
Leslie described Mr Tucker’s evidence as ‘the final nail in the coffin 
of the Tory smear campaign the Chancellor led last week’.

Deputy governor Paul Tucker rejected claims Labour ministers, including former City minister Ed Balls asked him to pressure Barclays to lower Libor submissions

But
David Cameron’s spokesman insisted Mr Osborne would not apologise, 
saying: ‘The Treasury has been making the position clear that he won’t. 
He [the Prime Minister] agrees with the Treasury.’

A Treasury source said: ‘Labour protests too much. Can they say that no Labour figure was aware of Libor low-balling?

Paul Tucker, pictured, denied he was ever encouraged to 'lean on' Barclays to lower its Libor submissions

‘Can
they say no Labour figure implicitly or explicitly condoned it in 
conversations with the banks? They haven’t been able  to so far.’

Mr Tucker, who is a frontrunner for 
the role of Governor when Sir Mervyn King steps down, told MPs this week
a record of a contentious phonecall he had with former Barclays boss 
Bob Diamond about Libor gave the 'wrong impression'.

Appearing
in front of the Treasury Select Committee, the senior banker said he 
had intended to ensure Barclays was not 'inadvertently sending distress 
signals' about its financial health at a time when the market viewed the
bank as the next in line for a government bailout.

The
deputy governor rejected claims that the then Downing Street chief of 
staff Sir Jeremy Heywood, then City minister Ed Balls and former 
Treasury minister Baroness Vadera had asked him to pressure Barclays to 
lower its Libor submissions.

He 
expressed concern that the rates for borrowing in US dollars were 
falling faster than those in sterling. In one email, Sir Jeremy asked Mr
Tucker if he had heard that Libor is high ‘because Barclays are bidding
it’.

However, at no point 
do the email exchanges show Sir Jeremy encouraging Mr Tucker to tell 
Barclays to manipulate its rates artificially.

Other
figures Mr Tucker suggested had raised concerns about borrowing rates 
include Gordon Brown’s private secretary Tom Scholar, another senior 
adviser Sir Jon Cunliffe and Treasury permanent secretary Sir Nicholas 
Macpherson.
