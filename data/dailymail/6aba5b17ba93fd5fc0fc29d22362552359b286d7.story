A European court has upheld a decision not to extradite a bungling German doctor to the UK over the death of a pensioner from a drugs overdose.

A coroner's inquest in the UK ruled that David Gray, 70, was unlawfully killed in 2008 after 'incompetent' Dr Daniel Ubani, who was working as an out of hours locum, fatally administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine.

The family of Mr Gray, of Manea, Cambridgeshire, have been campaigning for Dr Ubani to face charges in the UK over the death but this has been rejected by German authorities.

The 
European Court of Human Rights today backed a German investigation into his actions and a decision he should not be sent back to Britain.

Speaking 
on Sky News, Mr Gray's son Stuart, of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, 
said he was 'bitterly, bitterly disappointed' by the decision.

He
 added: 'I think it's got wider ramifications in the UK because it means
 people can come over from the European Union and not answer to UK law.

'We need 
to digest this and go back to our lawyers and see if we can lodge an 
appeal or not. He's still licensed to practice out there, we don't know 
what he's doing.'

Mr
 Gray's other son Rory, who lives in Germany, said: 'German authorities 
convicted him of a minor misdemeanour, there was no hearing, no trial 
and Ubani never answered for what he's done.

'This is a green light for charlatans to go to other countries and do whatever they like.'

Mr Gray had been suffering renal colic when he was treated by Dr Ubani at his home on February 16, 2008

His sons says Dr Ubani, who has been allowed to continue practicing in Germany, has never faced proper justice for his actions

The Strasbourg court ruled: 'The 
patient's sons complained that the authorities in Germany, where the 
doctor was tried and convicted of having caused the death by negligence,
 had not provided for an effective investigation into their father's 
death.

'The
 court accepted that the German trial court had sufficient evidence 
available to it for the doctor's conviction by penal order without 
having held a hearing.

Dr Ubani admitted he had confused morphine with another drug and a coroner branded him 'incompetent'
and described Mr Gray's death as 'gross negligence and manslaughter'

'Moreover,
 the [family] had been sufficiently informed of the proceedings in 
Germany, and the German authorities had been justified in not 
extraditing the doctor to the United Kingdom in view of the proceedings 
before the German courts.'

Dr Ubani, a 67-year-old Nigerian-born German citizen, was on his first UK shift as a locum when he killed Mr Gray by injecting 100mg of diamorphine.

He was struck off in the UK and given a suspended sentence in Germany for death by negligence but is still able to practice there.

A European arrest warrant was issued by Cambridgeshire Police but could not be carried out because legal proceedings had begun in Germany.

Mr Gray had been suffering renal colic when he was treated by Dr Ubani at his home on February 16, 2008.

His death highlighted national concerns about the standard of locum doctors from abroad working in the UK.

Coroner William Morris described Mr Gray's death as 'gross negligence and manslaughter' and said Dr Ubani was 'incompetent'.

Dr Ubani admitted he had confused the morphine with another drug. He had flown into the UK the day before his 12-hour Cambridgeshire shift for GP service provider Take Care Now, and had only had a few hours' sleep, a GMC panel was told.

A doctor who gave him an induction expressed concerns that Dr Ubani had no NHS experience, did not know the area, and that he did not have enough time to properly train him.

The doctor had previously not been selected by Leeds Primary Care Trust because he had failed a language test.

But the GMC panel heard evidence that Dr Ubani was competent in spoken English and his employers had no problems understanding him.
