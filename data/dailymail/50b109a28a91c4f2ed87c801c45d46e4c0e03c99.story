A mother-of-four claimed £100,000 in benefits saying she was unable to work because she is allergic to shoes.

Tracy Kenny, 45, a former baker, says she had to give up working 24 years ago after developing a skin condition that made it impossible for her to wear shoes.

She said severe dermatitis caused by all her footwear left her unable to hold down a job. But now inspectors at the Department for Work and Pensions have ruled she is fit for work and told her it will stop her £440 per month employment support benefits.

Disability benefits: Tracy Kenny, 45, has been unable to work because she has contact dermatitis and is unable to wear shoes

Mrs Kenny, who lost her appeal against the decision, said it was impossible for her to work as she suffers from an allergy to rubber, glue, nickel and metal that brings her out in blisters.

She says she is so allergic to shoes  she has to wander around barefoot,  even during winter, and can only  leave her house in Eccles, Salford, on a mobility scooter.

She said: ‘I don’t know how these  people expect me to go to work or go to job interviews with no shoes on – because that is what I would have to do.

‘I can only wear shoes for ten or 15  minutes, before my feet blister and split. It stops me from doing everything.

‘I’m allergic to any chemicals in shoes. The doctors even organised for a pair of clogs to be made in Switzerland for me.

‘It took two years. They even cut  down a tree especially and made me a shoe with no dyes in. Yet they still irritate me.

‘Socks draw the glue in and slippers don’t help. It’s so unfair and stressful – I’m genuinely ill.’

Medication: Tracy Kenny is largely housebound and has to take around 20 tablets as well as applying ointments and creams

Shoe allergy: Tracy had these shoes specially-made in Switzerland - but she is allergic to them too

Tracy Kenny suffers from contact dermatitis which is a type of eczema which makes her skin red, scaly and painful.

She says her condition flares up every time she comes into contact with rubber, glue, nickel and metal.

It most commonly affects the hands, but can affect other parts of the body. One in five women will suffer from a mild form of contact dermatitis and some point in their lifetime.

The condition is usually treated with moisturisers - and 40 per cent of sufferers find out the condition goes away altogether.

Her life on benefits ended after she took a medical test and faced  a tribunal from the DWP on October 2.

Now she has been declared fit to work, though she will still be allowed to claim £200 a month in disability living allowance.

She said: ‘They’re questioning my doctor’s ability as a doctor. She sees me and knows me more than a ten-minute assessment does.’

Mrs Kenny, who lives with scaffolder husband Steve, 49, and also has diabetes, said: ‘It started when I contracted dermatitis when I was 18 or 19.

'I was working at a baker’s and suddenly my hands started coming up blistering.

‘I was referred to the skin hospital where I was told it was the detergents I was using in the baker’s. I carried on working but it got worse and started to affect my face.’

She gave up the job and began working in a shop but found she was allergic to dust. She then changed jobs again and worked in a warehouse packing leaflets in magazines but found that played havoc with her allergies as well.

Disabled: Tracy Kenny has a mobility scooter to use on the rare occasions that she is able to venture out of her home in Salford - and often does so barefooted

Proud mother: Tracy's son Joshua is returning from Afghanistan after completing a tour of duty. She has four children, the youngest of whom is 18

Skin condition: Tracy, who wears white gloves to stop her hands coming into contact with things she is allergic to, holds a letter which explains her disability benefits are being stopped

Mrs Kenny said: ‘I worked up until I was 21. Since then I haven’t worked basically because things just got worse and worse.

‘I had some more tests done. I’m allergic to nickel, I’m told not to touch keys, not to touch coins, not to use knives and forks.’

She says her contact dermatitis causes a type of eczema leaving her skin red, itchy and scaly. She shares her home with her husband and their children Jessica, 21, Aimee-lea, 19, and Lauren, 18.

Son Josh, 22, was arriving back from Army duty in Afghanistan yesterday. They also have a dog Alfie and cat Bailey.

A spokesman for the DWP said decisions to remove benefits are only taken after careful assessment and consideration of medical evidence.

Margaret Cox, of the National Eczema Society, said: ‘People don’t understand just how awfully painful a severe eczema can be.’
