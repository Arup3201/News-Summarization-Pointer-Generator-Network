A pilot has admitted falling into a 'deep sleep' twice while in charge of a passenger plane from London to Los Angeles.

The pilot, who remains anonymous, explained that he could not sleep in London the night before because his hotel room was either 'too hot or too cold' resulting in him moving room three times.

The Civil Aviation Authority said the 
pilot voluntarily submitted a 'fatigue report' confessing to falling 
asleep in the flight deck.

A poor night's sleep in London: The pilot explained that he fell asleep while flying the plane from London to Los Angeles after he had trouble sleeping at his hotel

'I suddenly, and without any warning, fell into a deep sleep.

The same event occurred twice,' he said.

The pilot then had two rests on a bunk bed, after which he 'felt much better and continued to LAX without further difficulties'.

He was one of three pilots flying a 332-seat flight from London to Los Angeles in November 2011.

A spokesman explained that the pilot had 'nodded off 
twice for around a minute and woke spontaneously'.

She insisted though that 'safety
was not compromised at any point'.Â 

A survey by the European Cockpit Association last year revealed the scale of the problem. Four in 10 British pilots said they had fallen asleep at the controls.

The Air Line Pilots' Association said it showed the importance of air crew getting 'quality hotel rest'.

Air New Zealand will not be punishing the pilot because it says it does not want to discourage staff from reporting fatigue problems.
