Leon McKenzie is targetting a maiden title fight next year after signing a new promotional deal.

The former Norwich striker has won four and drawn one of his first five professional bouts since making his debut in June last year.

And super-middleight McKenzie hopes to reap the rewards in the ring next year.

'I've signed a really good promotional deal with Steve Goodwin,' he told Sportsmail. 'They've got a deal with Matchroom's Fight Pass which is really good.

'I'm just getting through some niggles from the last fight and I'm looking to be back out in December. If it all goes to plan I'll have another one after that then a title fight in March. 

'I think we're going to be looking at the Masters title, which will be a 10-round fight. 

That could make me the mandatory for the Southern Area title. Any title is a big ask but if I win that then who knows with regards to the big honours domestically.

'This will be fight No 6 coming up and I'm still undefeated. It's exciting to be doing what I'm doing at my age. I'm 37 and there's talk of a title. 

McKenzie hopes to fight for a title next year after winning four of his first five fights as a professional 

McKenzie admits he came into the sport late but is determined to make the most of the time he does have.

'I only stopped playing football a few years ago and to be going into another profession like I am now,' he added. 'Let's be honest not many people can come into professional boxing at 35 and do well.

'Curtis Woodhouse is a former British champion. He's already ticked the box, the whole footballer becomes boxer one.

'Once I've reached that level, it becomes whole different game. He's had a bit more time than me, I can only respect and appreciate the time I do have.'
