Gun shots rang out among as many as 800,000 marijuana smokers in Denver on Saturday wounding at least two people and sending thousands running for their lives.

A man and a woman were both shot in the leg, suffering non-life threatening injuries at Civic Center Park, as tens of thousands celebrated the counterculture holiday known as 4/20, Denver Police report.

Witnesses, still wracked from the Boston Marathon bombing that killed three on Monday, described mixed recounts of what they heard, some saying they heard three shots fired while others saying up to eight.

'We were standing just in front of the 
stage when we heard three loud pops, we don't know what it was, we 
couldn't see anything, and right away people started stampeding and 
running towards us, knocking booths over,' event goer Sarina Romero told
KDVR.

'That was when we saw police running toward it, guns drawn, 15-20 police officers all heading in that direction where the shots came from in front of the music stage, right in the center of the crowd,' she said.

'Some people
were yelling "explosion," some people were yelling, "gunshots." We 
couldn't really find if it was coming from the stage or from the side 
because there were just so many people literally just running at 
people,' a witness named Kyle told 7News.

Police say they are now looking for two male suspects with a motive for the shootings not known.

Panic: As many as 80,000 marijuana smokers ran for their lives in Denver after shots rang out ultimately injuring at least two people

Injuries: One victim was shot in the leg and another sustained unknown injuries at Civic Center Park as tens of thousands celebrated the counterculture holiday known as 4/20

Shots: Witnesses describe mixed recounts of what they heard, some saying they heard three shots fired while others saying up to eight

Laura Forduno who was one of the thousands running from the scene told the Denver Post she saw one of the victims lying on a street corner.

'There was a gentleman on the floor, lying there, and he was not moving,' Forduno said. 'It was chaos.'

Dean Zimmerman told the paper that he
was one of a few who stopped to help the man after he appeared to have 
been shot in his left thigh.

'I was talking to him, telling him, you're gonna be OK, you're gonna be OK,' Zimmerman said.

He says the man appeared calm, and even 'cool about it,' in Zimmerman's words.

Emergency: Paramedics appear to be treating a victim on the ground as officers look on, now searching for two male suspects

Backup: With a nation on edge following the Boston Marathon bombing on Monday the city had ample security on hand for Saturday's festivities

With a nation on edge following 
Monday's attack, the city reported having ample security on hand for 
Saturday's festivities, including a police force on motorcycles, horses 
and undercover who were joined by private security, volunteers and 
paramedics.

Police said 
earlier this week they're especially focused on crowd security in light 
of the attacks that killed three at the Boston finish line.

'We're aware of the events in 
Boston,' said Denver police spokesman Aaron Kafer, who declined to give 
specifics about security measures being taken. 'Our message to the 
public is that, if you see something, say something.'

'It was in the back of my head,' one event goer told KDVR of his initial worry of coming out today.

Packed: The city expected up to 80,000 people to pack this park on Saturday with the crowd and smoke seen covering it from end-to-end before shots rang out

Taken over: Members of a crowd numbering tens of thousands smoke marijuana and listen to live music, at the Denver 420 pro-marijuana rally that took over Civic Center Park

4/20: April 20th has for years been a celebration of marijuana counterculture, and the 2013 Denver rally draw larger crowds than previous years

Saturday was the first 4/20 celebration since Colorado and Washington made pot legal for recreation use.

Reggae
music filled the air, and so did the smell of marijuana, as celebrants 
gathered by mid-morning in a park just beside the state Capitol. Few 
police were initially in sight, though public marijuana use is still 
prohibited here.

'People aren't afraid to come out and celebrate it, the way they used to be,' said 52-year-old Charles Bade of Denver.

Bade carried a tie-dyed flag with a 
big cannabis leaf and wore a garland of fake marijuana leaves around his
neck. He said he's been marking 4/20 privately since he was 11 but 
decided to join this year's public smoke-out to celebrate the votes by 
Colorado and Washington last year to defy federal drug law and make pot 
legal.

Authorities generally look the other way at public pot smoking here on April 20.

Organizers say the event — which drew
50,000 people last year — could bring a record 80,000 this year, since 
it's the first celebration since Colorado and Washington voted to make 
pot legal for recreational use.

Group
smoke-outs are also planned Saturday from New York to San Francisco. 
The origins of the number '420' as a code for pot are murky, but the 
drug's users have for decades marked the date 4/20 as a day to use pot 
together.

Denver's celebration this year also features the nation's first open-to-all Cannabis Cup, a marijuana competition patterned after one held in Amsterdam.

Similar to a beer or wine festival, pot growers compete for awards for taste, appearance and potency of their weed. Denver's event, sponsored by High Times magazine, has sold out more than 5,000 tickets.

Snoop Lion, the new reggae- and marijuana-loving persona for the rapper better known as Snoop Dogg, received a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' from High Times. And the hip-hop group Cypress Hill was set to perform a sold-out concert Saturday evening in Colorado's iconic Red Rocks Amphitheatre.

Colorado and Washington are still waiting for a federal response to the votes and are working on setting up commercial pot sales, which are still limited to people with certain medical conditions. In the meantime, pot users are free to share and use the drug in small amounts.

A citizen advocacy group that opposes marijuana legalization, Smart Colorado, warned in a statement that public 4/20 celebrations 'send a clear message to the rest of the nation and the world about what Colorado looks like.'

'Does the behavior of the participants in these events reflect well on our state?' asked the head of Smart Colorado, Henny Lasley.

The organizer of Denver's 4/20 rally, Miguel Lopez, said the holiday is more than an excuse to get high — it's also a political statement by people who want to see the end of marijuana prohibition.

'You don't have to smoke weed to go to 4/20 rallies. You don't have to be gay to go to a Pride festival. You don't have to be Mexican to celebrate Cinco de Mayo,' Lopez said.

'That's what this is. It's a celebration, it's a statement about justice and freedom and this movement.'
