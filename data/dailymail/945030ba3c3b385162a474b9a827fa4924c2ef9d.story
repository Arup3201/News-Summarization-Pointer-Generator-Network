A suspect in the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl who was cleared for release by a Pakistani court last week was instead taken into custody, it has emerged.

On Friday, an anti-terrorist court said there was not enough evidence to hold Qari Hashim Ali, who had been detained in the Hyderabad central jail since August 2005 over the 2002 killing.

But rather than being released, he was taken back into custody, a government official told NBC.  

'According to intelligence and police assessments, the accused is still a threat to peace,' Niaz Ali Abbasi, the Home Secretary of Sindh province, told the channel.

'We feel that the people must be protected from this man.' 

Killed: Daniel Pearl, pictured in an image sent to  media organizations by his kidnappers, was beheaded in 2002. One of the suspects in his death was cleared for release last week but was taken back into custody

Pearl, the South Asia bureau chief at the Wall Street Journal, vanished in Karachi in January 2002. A month later authorities received video footage of him being beheaded. 

His decapitated body was found in a shallow grave in May 2002.

Hashim had been apprehended for arranging a meeting between Pearl and another of the men accused in the killing.

On Friday, court official Abdul Samih told the BBC that Justice Abdul Ghafoor Memon had ordered for Hashim to be released immediately and his attorneys had expressed their relief, saying there had not been any evidence to hold him.

After he remained in custody, government officials did not expand on why they believed he still posed a threat. 

The mastermind behind the killing, British-born Pakistani Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, was sentenced to death in 2002 and remains in the Hyderabad Central jail in Sindh province.

Tragic: Pearl was captured and beheaded as he researched militant groups in Karachi. One of the men accused of his death, Omar Sheikh (pictured right om 2002) has been sentenced to death

Earlier this year, Sheikh tried to hang himself in prison, AFP reported. 

His co-accused, Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem and Sheikh Adil, were given life sentences.

Another suspect, Saud Memon, who was accused of providing the place where Pearl was held before his death, died in mysterious circumstances in May 2007. 

Daniel Pearl was 38 when he died. He had been investigating militant groups in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks when he was kidnapped in Karachi in January, 2002.

Days before his abduction, Pearl had learned that his wife Mariane was expecting a baby boy.

After he vanished, Mariane remained in Pakistan and campaigned for her husband's release throughout his capture.

But on February 21, 2002, a shocking video of his killing was delivered to U.S. officials in Pakistan and his remains were found in a shallow grave on Karachi's outskirts three months later.

His son was born four months after he died.
