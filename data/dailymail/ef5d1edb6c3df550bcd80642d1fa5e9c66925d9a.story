A 21-year-old man studying how to teach church-goers about moral decision-making has been accused of shooting dead his 21-year-old fiancee and making it look like a suicide.

Music education student Olivia Greenlee was found dead in her 2001 Toyota Corolla in the parking lot of Tennessee's Union University on Wednesday morning.

Her fiancee, Christianity student Charles Pittman, was arrested on Friday and charged with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence.

The couple, both students at the Jackson evangelical college who lived separately off campus, were planning to wed in August.

According to The Jackson Sun, police claim evidence shows Pittman shot his fiancee in her car on Tuesday night. Preliminary results show Greenlee died from a single gunshot wound.

Investigators found a gun in the car which belonged to Pittmanâ€™s friend and said it was taken without the friend's knowledge. 

Cops claim Pittman staged the crime scene to make it look like his young lover, who he proposed to in May 2013, had killed herself.

Pittman's arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday in Jackson City Court.

Pittman is a Union University senior majoring in Christian ministries. Union is a private Christian liberal arts university with about 4,200 students.

According to the university's website, ministry students are taught about Christian 
ethics, 'approaches to moral decision-making', sermon delivery and 
'marriage relationships' in order to 'equip bi-vocational pastors, staff, and laity for Christian service'.

News of the shock alleged homicide has rocked the Christian community, with mourners gathering at Union Universityâ€™s G.M. Savage Memorial Chapel on Friday.

'Many of us are baffled, in disbelief, sad and grieving, yet grieving not without hope because of our faith and our confidence in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ,' Union President Dr. David Dockery told the assembly, according to The Jackson Sun.

'The Bible tells us to weep with those who weep. And across campus this week, there have been plenty of tears.'

According to her obituary, Greenlee was a member at First Baptist Church in Dyersburg.

She
 was a member of Union University Singers, a group leader for the 
children's music camps and the Zeta Tau Alpha Sorority, where she 
participated in many community activities.

The 2010 Dyersburg High School graduate 
was actively involved the school's theater productions, including 'Just 
Another High School Play.'

She is survived by her parents, Barry and
 Tina Greenlee, and two sisters.

Tributes have flooded social media, with friends and family describing her as 'sweet' and 'beautiful'.

Greenlee's Zeta Tau Alpha sorority sisters said in a statement they were being supported through their tragic loss.

'Campus organizations and the staff at Union have provided incredible support to the ZTA chapter,' they wrote.

Meanwhile, Dockery released a statement on Saturday calling for 'understanding'.

'This tragedy, involving two Union University commuter students, is incredibly devastating and saddening news,' he wrote.

'Understanding that an arrest is not the same thing as a conviction, we now need to let the judicial process run its course. Union University continues to cooperate with authorities.'

Police have not yet said what they believe to be the motive for Greenleeâ€™s alleged shooting.
