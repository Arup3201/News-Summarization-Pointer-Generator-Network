Mrs Obama then proceeded to carefully inspect the massive fir, touching its needles and inhaling the aroma before asking her daughters what they thought of this year’s selection.

‘I love it,’ Malia said. ‘We’ll keep it.’

The first lady, who was holding Sunny – the newest addition to the first family – on a leash jokingly asked the fluffy pooch what was her opinion.

‘What do you think, Sunny?… This is Sunny’s first Christmas tree arrival,’ the proud dog owner announced.

In honor of the festive occasion, both Sunny and Bo, the Obamas’ Portuguese water dogs, wore Santa hats tied around their necks.

While during President Obama’s annual 
turkey pardoning ceremony Wednesday it was Malia who nearly stole the 
show with her green Doc Marten boots, on Friday it was Sasha's turn to 
put her best foot forward in a pair of futuristic silver-and-black Oxford lace-ups.

In an earlier interview with Ladies' Home Journal, Mrs Obama explained that the Christmas tree in the Blue Room – the largest in the house – has always been dedicated to military families, Detroit Free Press reported.

This is the third time since 2006 that the first family – first the Bushes and then the Obamas - have turned to the Crystal Spring Tree Farm for the officialsWhite House tree, NBC Philadelphia reported.

Last year’s tree came from North Carolina. This year, the Obamas tried to obtain a tree from New Jersey’s Wykoff Tree Farm, which had won the National Christmas Tree Association's annual contest, but the growers did not have anything big enough to fill the Blue Room of the White House, according to MyFoxDC.
