The night four Americans - including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens - were killed during a terrorist in Benghazi, Libya, last year, there reportedly were dozens of CIA operatives on the ground near the scene that night - and now the spy agency is going to great lengths to keep whatever they were doing there a secret.

According to published reports, since January, several CIA operatives involved in the missions in Libya have been forced to submit to multiple polygraph tests - in some cases, operatives were given a test on a monthly basis.

According to sources with direct knowledge of the situation, the agency is questioning operatives to find out whether they are talking about Benghazi with the media or with members of Congress, which just demanded that an investigation into the terrorist attack be a priority of the FBI's new director, James Comey.

What Happened? Nobody seems to know exactly what happened during the Benghazi attack - and the CIA seems to want to keep it that way

According to CNN - which broke the story about the number of operatives on the ground the night of the attack, and the CIA's frequent use of polygraphs - a CNN operative who passes information on to Congress or the media faces career-ending consequences.

One of CNN's sources described the CIA's attempts to keep elements of the Benghazi attack as 'unprecendented.'

'You have no idea the amount of pressure being brought to bear on anyone with knowledge of this operation,' one source said.

Another source described the CIA's tactics as 'pure intimidation.'

In internal communications obtained by the network, one insider writes, 'You don't jeopardize yourself, you jeopardize your family as well.'

According to former CIA operative and CNN analyst Robert Baer, agents are generally questioned once every three to four years, 'never more than that.'

'If somebody is being polygraphed every month, or every two months it's 
called an issue polygraph, and that means that the polygraph division 
suspects something, or they're looking for something, or they're on a 
fishing expedition. But it's absolutely not routine at all to be 
polygraphed monthly, or bi-monthly,' Baer continued.

The CIA denies that it is trying to keep things from Congress.

In a statement, CIA spokesman Dean Boyd insists that the agency has 'worked closely with its oversight committees to provide them with an 
extraordinary amount of information related to the attack on U.S. 
facilities in Benghazi.'

'CIA employees are always free to speak to Congress if they want,' the 
statement continued. 'The CIA enabled all officers involved in Benghazi 
the opportunity to meet with Congress. We are not aware of any CIA 
employee who has experienced retaliation, including any non-routine 
security procedures, or who has been prevented from sharing a concern 
with Congress about the Benghazi incident.'

According to one CNN source, there were as many as 35 CIA operatives on the ground in Benghazi on the night of the attack, with up to seven wounded, in some cases seriously. At least 21 were in the building known as the Annex.

The actual number of operatives in Benghazi that night remains a mystery, though, as well as what - exactly - they were doing there.

'We should have the people who were on the scene come in, testify under 
oath, do it publicly, and lay it out. And there really isn't any 
national security issue involved with regards to that,' Congressman Frank Wolf - who has been seeking answers about what happened in Benghazi for over a year.

'I think it is a form of a cover-up, and I think it's an attempt to push 
it under the rug, and I think the American people are feeling the same 
way,' he continued.

Wolf also says that in the immediate aftermath of the attack, there were several people with close ties to CIA operatives and contractors who contacted him wanting to talk. Now, he said, there is silence.

'Initially they were not afraid to come forward. They wanted the 
opportunity, and they wanted to be subpoenaed, because if you're 
subpoenaed, it sort of protects you, you're forced to come before 
Congress. Now that's all changed,' Wolf said.
