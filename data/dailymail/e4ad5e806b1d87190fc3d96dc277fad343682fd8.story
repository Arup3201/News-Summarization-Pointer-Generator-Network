The IRS, long Americans' least-favorite government agency, is likely to be a lot less popular this tax season - refunds will be slower, the risk of identity theft will be higher and there will be longer hold times to reach customer service. 

By some estimates, fewer than half of the taxpayers who call the IRS will be able to speak to a representative.  

IRS Commissioner John Koskinen revealed  to the changes to employees in a memo - saying budget cuts have taken their toll on the Internal Revenue Service. 

On the plus side, for some Americans - there will also be far fewer audits, 46,000 fewer  this year than last - and 1,800 fewer IRS enforcement officers.

Tax refunds will take longer to get to Americans, and less people will be audited

Its all the result of massive cuts the IRS has suffered this year, with a reduction of about $600million claims Koskinen in his the email, obtained by ABC News.

Oddly enough, the cuts hurt the government more than anyone, who will lose out on receiving an estimated $2billion in tax revenue - at the very least, Koskinen claims.

'We now anticipate an even lower level of telephone service than before,' writes Koskinen, 'which raises the real possibility that fewer than half of taxpayers trying to call us will actually reach us.' 

He then adds, 'we have no choice but to do less with less.' 

As for the refund check delay, it won't be too bad, with most Americans only having to wait about one extra week.

Taxes must be filed by midnight on April 15.
