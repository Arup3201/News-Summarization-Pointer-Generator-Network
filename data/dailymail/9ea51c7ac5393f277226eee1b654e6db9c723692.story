Gus Poyet insists he is satisfied Sunderland did everything they could during the transfer window to try to build a squad capable of becoming a force in the Premier League.

Poyet failed to land top target Fabio Borini during the summer after a long running saga, but did manage to add defender Sebastian Coates and winger Ricky Alvarez to his squad before the September 1 deadline.

The arrival of Liverpool’s Coates and Inter Milan’s Alvarez meant that Sunderland ended the window with eight new players and both could be involved against Tottenham on Saturday at the Stadium of Light.

Poyet is still a striker, and possibly another full-back, short of what he would have liked in his squad having strongly pushed to secure the services of Borini after a £14m fee was agreed in July.

And the Sunderland head coach, who took part in some football tennis with his squad during training, said: 'It is very easy to say that I am happy because then everyone would be delighted. I’m alright, but I wouldn't say I am happy.

'We expected to have a certain number of players, we were close to doing a couple of important things, but we tried. We tried our best. What we got was the best we could do. I don’t want to reflect on how it went because it is not fair.'

Alvarez has arrived on a season-long loan and should provide an exciting option down the left hand side, although he can play on both flanks. The Argentine should provide a different threat, although he is not a renowned goalscorer.

Poyet said: 'People will think that Ricky is the substitute for Borini, but he is not. It’s different opinions. Ricky is a player who is exciting on the ball, he will create things on his own but he is not a proper scorer.

'We can’t say he is a replacement for the other one. He is going to play in a position where Fabio played last year, but I don’t know if he will play on the left all of the time.'
