Bringing back apprenticeships: Prime Minister David Cameron will announce that work-based training will form a crucial part of this month's Budget

David Cameron will today pledge to make it the ‘new norm’ for school leavers to take an apprenticeship or go to university.

Government sources said that in the next stage of welfare reform, an ‘earn or learn’ scheme could be introduced - meaning school leavers will not be able to claim out of work benefits if they do not enter a job or take up an offer of work-based training.

An expansion in work-based training will form a key part of this month’s Budget.

The Prime Minster wants the country 
to follow Germany’s lead where apprenticeships sits alongside higher 
education as an entry point to high quality careers.

Ministers
want to create higher-level apprenticeships with the same value as 
degrees and postgraduate qualifications - allowing people to become 
accountants, airline pilots or other lucrative professions without going
to university.

Barclays will today announce a scheme 
that will give businesses free support to take on an extra 10,000 
apprentices, in partnership with the National Apprenticeship Service and
charities Tomorrow’s People and The Prince’s Trust.

During a visit to a training academy in 
Buckinghamshire to mark the start of National Apprenticeship Week, Mr 
Cameron will call on employers, schools and colleges, and his own 
ministers to expand apprenticeship opportunities for young people.

‘Apprenticeships are at the heart of our mission to rebuild the economy, giving young people the chance to learn a trade, to build their careers, and create a truly world-class, high-skilled workforce that can compete and thrive in the fierce global race we are in,’ the Prime Minister will say.

‘There are record numbers of people taking up an apprenticeship, with a million starting one in the last few years.

And as we take forward... our drive to reform and strengthen apprenticeships, raising standards and making them more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers - means that an apprenticeship is increasingly seen as a first choice career move.'

‘But we need to challenge ourselves to go even further, that is why I want it to be the new norm for young people to either go to university or into an apprenticeship.

'We need to look at how we can expand apprenticeship opportunities so that they are available to all young people who are ready and eager to take them up, and aspire to get ahead in life.’

A report from the Centre for Economics and Business Research says that between now and 2021, 3.8 million people will complete apprenticeships - adding £3.4 billion to the UK economy in productivity gains.

Every person that completes work-based training increases business productivity by £214 per week, leading to increased profits, lower prices, better products and higher wages, it says.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘This research confirms the economic importance of apprenticeships and sends a clear message that they deliver for employers, individuals and the economy.

‘Since 2010 we have had over a million people start an apprenticeship in the UK. But I want to see more small and medium businesses reap the benefits of apprenticeships which is why we have introduced a £1,500 incentive for those who take on a young person.

Charles Davis, of the Cebr, said: ‘The importance of apprenticeships to businesses and the wider UK recovery cannot be underestimated.

'Our research clearly demonstrates the significant contribution that apprenticeships can make to economic growth. 

'Raising the skills of the UK’s 
workforce translates into improved UK competitiveness in a challenging 
post-financial crisis environment.

 'This is a vital part of rebalancing the UK economy and raising the chances of sustained export-led growth.’

Ashok Vaswani, Chief Executive of Barclays Retail and Business Banking, said: ‘We’ve seen first hand how our apprentices are incredibly productive and valued members of staff, which is why we are now doubling our recruitment to 2,000.

'But we often also find great young people who want to work in other industries, and we believe we can help them into work through our vast network of business customers.

'Our new package of free support is available to any businesses whether they bank with us or not because we are aiming to make a really big difference to young people’s careers, and to our economy.’
