Manchester United are to go without a trophy for two seasons for the first time in 26 years.

Louis van Gaal's team were beaten 2-1 by Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-final on Monday night, meaning United will now concentrate on qualifying for the Champions League instead.

It makes this their longest run without winning the FA Cup since between 1963 and 1977, and Van Gaal is breaking all the unwanted records in his debut season at Old Trafford.

United went without a trophy in the 1987-88 and 1988-89 seasons when Sir Alex Ferguson was manager, but their FA Cup exit leaves them with only the top four to fight for.

Van Gaal has won a trophy in his first season at every club he's managed, except for AZ Alkmaar, but he will not be able to keep that up this year.

It was Danny Welbeck that came back to haunt him as the former United player scored the winner for Arsenal to qualify for the semi-final.
