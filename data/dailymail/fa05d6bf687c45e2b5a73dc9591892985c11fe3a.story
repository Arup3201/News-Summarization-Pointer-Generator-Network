Anthony Weiner's wife boasted in a gushing interview of how he did all the chores around the house and was the 'best husband he could be' - not knowing that all the while, he was sexting his online mistress.

The couple invited People magazine into their home in July 2012 for the first in-depth interview since Weiner resigned from Congress the year before.

Huma Abedin said she did so, because photographers were still stationed outside their home, 'as
 if we should have something to hide' - words which have 
undoubtedly come back to haunt her in wake of the recent scandal.

Despondent: New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner speaks to voters during a campaign stop on Monday, July 29, despite calls for him to step down

Smug: The campaign manager who helped to guide Weiner's bid for New York City mayor resigned over the weekend adding more misery to his woes

Frenzy: Last week, he admitted his more than six-month virtual relationship began at the same time as the People interview and has attributed his behavior to a 'rough patch' in their relationship

Sex pad: Sydney Leathers told how Anthony Weiner talked about renting her a $5000-a-month condo in Chicago

She said she wanted to let everyone know how much her husband had changed and that they had moved on, even saying she was proud to be married to him. 

'Anthony would be the first to tell you 
that he regrets the mistakes that he made and he has spent every single 
day since then trying to be the best dad he can be, the best husband he 
can be and it shows,' she said.

Devoted daddy: Weiner said quiet time with his son at 3am helped turn him into a different person

'I consider myself very lucky to be married to him. 
I'm proud to be married to him, I want Jordan to be proud of who his 
father is.

'We're a happy family. We're a couple in love and have a 
baby boy who is a reflection of that love and I want people to know 
that. I just want people to know we're a normal family.'

She continued to tell People magazine how Weiner does all the chores around the house as well as the 3am baby shift.

Though it appeared all of his time was spent on acting like husband of the year, the disgraced politician still managed 
to squeeze in some extra-curricular activities outside of 
laundry duty - this was when he started his online affair with Sydney.

'I have not washed a single piece of 
clothing ever. Anthony does all our laundry. I have not been to our dry 
cleaner. He does that,' Huma boasted.

'He makes my tea when I get up in the morning. He's just a loving, caring, thoughtful spouse and partner.'

Looking ever the devoted father and husband in the accompanying photo shoot, Weiner said: 'Every day since this has happened, I've 
tried to become a better person, a husband that Huma deserves and as 
good a father as I can be.'

Last
 week, he admitted that his more than six-month virtual relationship 
began at the same time and has attributed his behavior to a 'rough 
patch' in their relationship - a far cry from the united front they put 
on for the magazine.

'The
 fact is that it was the time that my wife and I were working through 
some things in our marriage.' he said during a press conference last 
week.

'It was a terrible mistake that I unfortunately returned to during a rough time in our marriage.'

sexting allegations emerged

The mayoral candidate also mused in the People interview how much cradling his son at 3am gave him a sense of still and calmness he never had before.

'I learned that I always had a great sense of where I was going and how to get there next but I didn’t have a good sense of just sitting and being and feeling and having a sense of peace.

'That's not my m.o. Of all the adjectives you could use to describe Anthony Weiner, "still" wouldn't be one of them. I really do feel like a very, very different person.'

But, unfortunately for Huma, for the next six months he engaged in lewd online conversations with the 23-year-old political student, exchanged explicit pictures and even promised to set her up in a Chicago condo so they could meet in person.

Though their interactions started to peter out by Christmas, she revealed he contacted her as recently as April.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline at the weekend, Sydney Leathers unashamedly lifted the lid on Weiner's depraved and bizarre sexual fantasies, and how he sighed: 'Oh baby, I want to suck your toes', while demanding photos of her feet in high heel shoes.

The man she said she once put up on a pedestal, she now brands as a ‘narcissist’, adding: ‘I don’t think he’s an ethical man. I don’t think he’s an honest man or a trustworthy man. I certainly don’t think he should be the mayor of New York City.

'He would say all sorts of things, and wanted me wearing high heels and nothing else,’ she said. 'For some reason, he just wanted me to be in heels all the time.'
