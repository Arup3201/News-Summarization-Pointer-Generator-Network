Parents will be able to compare their child’s academic performance with other pupils of similar social backgrounds for the first time with a new Government app.

Department of Education officials say that data based on exam results - such as GCSEs and SATs - is now so sophisticated it can be broken down into social groups based on factors such as family wealth.

They are working with technology companies to produce a user-friendly digital app and have launched a pilot scheme with 100 volunteer parents.

Tap to compare: The programme will allow parents to compare exam results across a wide range of factors

A DofE spokesman said: ‘The information would allow parents to have a clearer sense of how their child is performing.’

They can also see what proportion of pupils from each school or college progress to the best universities.

Smart idea: The app will also include data on which schools and college send pupils to which universities
