Aston Villa are confident they have moved ahead of Crystal Palace in the pursuit of Manchester City winger Scott Sinclair.

The Premier League champions have made Sinclair available this month and Villa are understood to be edging closer to a permanent move worth around £2.5million. Paul Lambert has been eager to secure a genuine winger to add creative spark to his team, who have scored only 12 goals all season.

Sinclair starred for Swansea and earned an £8m move to the Etihad in 2012, but has failed to make any impact. He spent last season on loan at West Bromwich Albion but played just 301 minutes in all.

This season he has made just three substitute appearances and has missed out on the matchday squad most weeks.

But Lambert feels he could get Sinclair back to his best with regular football and reinvigorate his team.
