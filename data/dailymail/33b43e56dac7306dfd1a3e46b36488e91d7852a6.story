Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has pledged to bid on Katie Price’s silicone breast implants if they go up for auction.

The 24-year-old, who had a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, said she would bid on the star’s implants because she wants to have both the first and second ‘most famous’ boobs in the country.

The unemployed mother of three’s vow came after Miss Price said she wanted to sell the implants from her six boob jobs in an attempt to raise money for breast cancer charities.

The 24-year-old took to Twitter to reveal she would be bidding on Miss Price's old implants if they went on sale

Miss Cunningham, from Leeds, who recently gave birth to her third child, took to her Twitter page to reveal her intentions to bid on the model’s assets.

She wrote: ‘OMG I’m deffo going to be bidding on @MissKatiePrice boobs! I’ve got the most famous t*ts in the country. Only fair I have the 2nd as well. (sic)

She later added: ‘I’ll be the first one bidding.’

Yesterday, The Sun revealed how Miss Price was considering selling her silicone implants as she prepares to undergo her seventh boob job.

The 36-year-old mother of five, who wants another operation to ‘perk’ up her boobs after having her recent daughter Bunny, told the newspaper: ‘I love them but I’d sell them in The Sun for a breast cancer charity. 

'You could have these very breasts right from inside me in a few weeks.

‘I can even sign them with a marker pen.’ 

She also revealed how she keeps her silicone implants in a safe at her home in West Sussex.

Ms Cunningham shot to notoriety last year when she had an NHS-funded operation to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been bullied since she was 14 for having a flat chest.

She has since gone on to make a name for herself over the past 12 months by selling a number of stories, including how she received Botox on the NHS for a 'sweat problem' and debated aborting her baby for the chance to appear on Big Brother.

She has previously admitted to not knowing who the father of her newborn child is, claiming she fell pregnant while working as a £1,000-a-night escort. 

At one point, the former escort tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cost of her NHS-funded breast augmentation but admitted she could not uphold her pledge when she fell pregnant. 

She continued to soak up public funds for some time afterwards, by receiving state-funded transport to take her children to school because of the 'negative attention' she receives on public transport.

However, Leeds City Council eventually decided to axe the service, prompting Miss Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’

Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid for by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

Miss Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

The mother of three later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

She made headlines again when she said she wanted a nose job - funded by the public.

She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

The 24-year-old claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’.

It came after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

Ahead of A-level exam results being released in August, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont).

'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.'

During her pregnancy, the former escort stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job.

She had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her own controversial breast enhancement surgery.

Using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, she said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her.

It came after she had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy.

She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'.

Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child.

Four tickets to the home birth sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000.

It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink.

But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.
