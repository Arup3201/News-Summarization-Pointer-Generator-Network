You begin to believe Tim Sherwood after a night like this. Aston Villa’s first win since December 7 came in the 94th minute through their first penalty award of the season. It was late, it was a little lucky, but it was deserved.

A roar rose out of Villa Park louder than any heard in a long while.

Sherwood, hugged and lifted by goalkeeping coach Tony Parks, looked like he was emitting the most decibels. In the instant Christian Benteke rolled the ball beyond Ben Foster from 12 yards the mood in this stadium lifted.

Seven consecutive defeats punctuated by one mighty win. How momentous it proves remains to be seen, the battle will present many turns, but this felt seismic.

Sherwood owes a large dose of gratitude to Foster, mind you.

In the third minute of added time the West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper launched into a calamitous dive after fumbling a bouncing ball, bringing down Matt Lowton in the process.

Referee Jonathan Moss pointed to the penalty spot. Benteke was the calmest man in the ground, placing the ball the other side of Foster. No longer do Villa hold the unwanted tag of only side in England’s top four divisions without a league win in 2015.

It was earned based on a display of vigour, purpose and creativity. Gabby Agbonlahor, scorer of Villa’s first, played his best game in recent memory.

Albion boss Tony Pulis conceded Foster had a ‘poor night’ but refused to blame his No 1. Foster looked shaky throughout and played a part earlier in the decisive goal by only palming Fabian Delph’s shot from long range. He saved Leandro Bacuna’s rebound but Alan Hutton collected the ball and delivered the cross that ultimately led to the penalty award.

Hutton’s involvement at this stage was moot. He should have been dismissed earlier for a nasty lunge on Saido Berahino, who received studs into his midriff. Agitated, Berahino reacted. Joleon Lescott appeared to offer Hutton down the tunnel in a ruckus. Moss booked Berahino and Hutton, meaning retrospective action from the FA on the Scottish right-back is unlikely.

Before Benteke struck, it had seemed Berahino’s equaliser would crush Villa. In the 66th minute the Albion striker applied a simple header from two yards out after Lescott had headed back Chris Brunt’s corner.

His 12th Premier League goal of the season is only three behind Villa’s total — an example of their struggles as much as his fine form.

Sherwood, who had seen his team lose to an injury time penalty to Stoke in his first home match in charge, was in no mood to downplay his first win as Villa manager. ‘It was the best feeling in the world,’ he said. ‘When I left home my missus said she had done the Euromillions. £54million. But I said I would rather have three points all day. Seriously.

‘It was massive, huge for us. We deserved to win the game but it was nice to get a slice of luck. I thought we started really well and inspired the fans. The boys in the dressing room want to give them a lot of confidence.’ At the end he checked his pulse by pressing fingers to neck. ‘I was just checking I was still alive,’ he laughed. ‘But we’re alive and kicking.’

Coming against the club that elected to employ Pulis rather than him in their own relegation fight must have offer pleasure.

Foster almost gifted Villa the lead in the 14th minute. He can thank goalline technology that parity was maintained. Delph sent over a cross that was headed back into danger by Benteke. Agbonlahor spun and hit a tame shot that Foster looked like he had collected until the ball squirmed through his legs and apparently over the line before the keeper reclaimed it. Replays showed there was an inch in it.

But Villa found confidence. In the 23rd minute the home roar was released. Brad Guzan fired a clearance high and long, Benteke leapt to win the flick-on and release Agbonlahor, whose pace left Lescott in the dust. The Villa striker raced into the box and delivered a finish through the legs of Foster, ahead of Gareth McAuley’s dive.

As Villa Park erupted, Agbonlahor ran in front of the West Brom supporters cupping his ear.

Sherwood jigged down the touchline towards the Holte End, his hands gripped in fists of delight.

It was a similar scene at the final whistle and later a disappointed Foster tweeted his apologies. ‘I love you all,’ he said.

Unfortunately for him, those feeling will be reciprocated by Villa and their fans. Not least Sherwood.
