Accused: Dr Michele Koo is at the centre of 10 lawsuits filed by fuming patients

Ten horrified plastic surgery patients are suing their doctor after finding pictures of their naked selves posted alongside their names on the internet.

The St Louis area women, aged from 21 to 58 at the time of their surgeries, have filed lawsuits against their cosmetic surgeon after undergoing breast augmentation procedures.

They said they were outraged when internet searches of their names pulled up before and after photographs of their breasts, which they say they had been led to believe would be used only anonymously.

Some found the photos doing internet searches of their own names, others were informed by friends who came across the images.

All 10 of the suits accuse Kirkwood plastic surgeon Dr Michele Koo of negligence and lawyers claim there are more than 30 other women who suffered the same mis-treatment.

The photos are used as a marketing tool by Koo's clinic. They are not publicly labeled with names but if names aren't removed from the picture file on databases then they can crop up during internet searches.

So it has now become a blame game between Koo and the company that ran her website, the St Louis Post Dispatch reported.

Long Island, New York based MedNet Technologies Inc manages sites for more than 2,500 health care providers worldwide, opening up the alarming possibility that the problem is even more widesppread than realised.

In court filings, Koo's lawyers blame MedNet, saying it failed to maintain Koo's site in a 'competent and professional manner.'

One lawyer, Jonathan Ries, said: 'Whatever Dr. Koo did do or didn't do' she had 'no intention' of linking pictures and names.

Predictably MedNet denies responsibility, claiming legal immunity under the Communications Decency Act, which protects websites from suits over postings by third parties, and insisting it was Koo's responsibility to prevent the leaking.

As the issue deepens it seems that other website-running companies may be involved as well.

Neil Bruntrager, a lawyer for eight of the patients, said he has been contacted by lawyers from four states, concerned about other companies. 'I think this is a much bigger issue,' he said.

Einstein Medical is one of them, running a website for Dr Dennis Hurwitz in San Diago. The company is already involved in a lawsuit after pictures of a patient came up in a similar issue.

Outraged: The women came across photographs of their breasts alongside their names

The women suing Koo believed the photos were taken for solely for medical purposes and say they were originally told their names would not be linked to any of the photos.

In court filing's Koo's laywers say her patients signed waivers, allowing their photographs to be used.But while patients give permission for them to be used 'for the purpose of informing the medical profession or the general public' the next line asserts that 'neither I, nor any member of my family, will be identified by name in any publication.'

The arrangement appears to comply with HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, but only if the photos do not reveal identities.

The women involved in the lawsuits are suing anonymously and say they feel violated by what has happened.

Court papers state the women suffered 'shame, humiliation, embarrassment, anxiety, nervousness, [and] loss of sleep' as a result of the pictures.

Denial: Dr Koo blames the company that runs her website

One of the lawsuits states: '[The] Plaintiff did not consent to the use of her photographs or the disclosure of her name on the internet.

'Plaintiff was not notified or advised that her photographs were on the internet either before or after the photographs and name were published by Dr. Koo.

'Defendant Dr. Koo knew or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care that plaintiff's photographs and name had been improperly disseminated and used and knew or should have known that they did not have authorisation to disseminate and use the plaintiff's photographs or personal information.'

Upset: The women said they felt violated and humiliated on finding the photographs

The victims claim the pictures are an invasion of their privacy, an exploitation of the plaintiff's images and medical information, a use of unreasonable 'publicity', and a breach of fiduciary duty and wrongful commercial appropriation.

Bruntrager said his clients are particularly eager to get every picture off the web, but there is no way to know how each may have been shared.

'There's always the possibility it will reappear,' he said. 'We will never have absolute certainty that we will have it all.'
