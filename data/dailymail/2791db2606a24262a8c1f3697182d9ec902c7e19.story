Three years ago, she was left at the altar by celebrity chef Todd English.

And now, jilted bride Erica Wang has been charged with shoplifting - after allegedly stealing $52,000 worth of clothing from the Ralph Lauren store where she worked.

Wang, 36, of Manhattan, was caught taking almost $6,000 of clothing last Wednesday and then confessed to swiping another $46,000 in merchandise, sources told the New York Post.

She had been working at the designer's flagship shop, on Madison Avenue at East 72nd Street, for nearly eight months.

According to a criminal complaint 
that cited a witness, Wang stuff nine items, worth $5,944.25, into a 
black shopping bag last week.

She was apprehended by a colleague after trying leave through the employee exit.

At this point, Wang not only confessed to the crime but also admitted her earlier theft from the shop, the complaint said.

Wang,
a former Peninsula Hotel concierge, said: 'I stole $46,194 worth of 
merchandise, not including the $6,000 I stole today,' according to the 
complaint.

She added that she 'did pay for said items and had a receipt that [she] was going to retrieve'.

But 'instead of getting said receipt, [Wang hid the] items inside of a storage room'.

She returned to the storage room the next day and hid the clothing in another location in the same room.

Wang was charged with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property.

She was released on her own recognizance after appearing at Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday.

According
to her father, Raymond Wang, she then flew to California to be with her
family for one night and then went to Hong Kong.

Asked about her alleged crimes, Mr Wang said: 'That was months ago.'

Todd
English, 51, has overseen a number of eateries including The Plaza 
Hotel Food Hall in New York, Figs in Florida, and Olives in Boston and 
Las Vegas.

The restaurateur is divorced from his first wife, Olivia, with whom he had three children.

He had planned to marry Wang in October 2009 in a lavish $150,000 wedding at the St Regis Hotel in New York.

But
just hours before the ceremony, Mr English phoned Wang and told her: 'I
know this call is long overdue, but I can’t marry you today.'

'Todd English is lucky he didn’t 
marry her,' a source told the Post.
