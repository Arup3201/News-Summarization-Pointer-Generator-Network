Mr Marsh, 64, works at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, south London

A leading neurosurgeon has spoken of the ‘torture’ of keeping a stiff upper lip in the face of the suffering he sees in his job.

Henry Marsh said yesterday that doctors had to hide the distress they feel at patients’ pain because families did not want to see them ‘weeping at the end of the bed’.

The consultant, who was made a CBE in 2010, said neurosurgery had a high potential for ‘catastrophe’. He added: ‘It’s difficult to know how people cope.

‘It’s torture. And you can’t show it. Patients and their families don’t want to see you weeping at the end of the bed.’ 

Mr Marsh, 64, who works at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, south London, has become known for his outspoken views.

Earlier this year, he questioned how effective cycle helmets were at preventing brain damage.

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival about his memoir, Do No Harm, he criticised NHS bureaucracy, saying: ‘You need management, you need regulation.

‘The problem is, it needs to be intelligent. With the bureaucracy in this country, it’s not. It’s one size fits all.’

He said: ‘It does make it very irritating when you’re lectured to by a young person about how you have to show empathy for patients and how to lift cardboard boxes. It’s grotesque.

‘If you treat stupid, you make stupid. If you get people doing silly unnecessary paperwork, as the nurses do, you damage the rest of it.’

He gave the example of nurses being needlessly forced to check the stools of neurosurgery patients, saying: ‘My criticism is of this sort of bull****. You should talk to the neurosurgery doctors and say, “what information do you need to treat your patients?”. Instead there’s a directive from above. It’s humiliating and dumb.’

Mr Marsh said useful equipment was often scrapped simply because manufacturers made it difficult to get spare parts. He said: ‘The equipment manufacturers are capitalist. They need to bring out new models all the time.

‘If you look at any hospital, you can see a huge amount of second-hand equipment basically not being used.’

And he said that reduced working hours for junior doctors were ‘wrong’ and would mean younger surgeons gained less hands-on experience. He added: ‘Surgery is a practical craft. How you learn is very important.’
