A cocktail garnished with enough food to feed an entire family has become a huge sensation at a Canadian bar.

Caesars - a Canadian take on the Bloody Mary containing vodka, tomato juice, clam juice, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce - is usually topped with celery and lime.

But the Score on Davie pub in Vancouver has piled a roasted whole chicken, burger, pulled pork Sriracha-glazed slider, onion rings, chicken wings, pulled pork mac and cheese hotdog and even a brownie to their latest concoction.

Colossal cocktail: The drink has burgers, a roast chicken, buffalo wings, a hot dog and a whipped cream-topped chocolate brownie

For just $60 (£32) the whopping 5,000 calorie 
creation can easily feed a group of friends and has sold out every day 
since the bar added it to their menu.

Owner
 Jesse Ritchie said: 'The Caesars were invented by one of our staff 
Peter Verge who was in the US and saw some people putting cheeseburgers 
on their Bloody Mary's as a joke.

'He
 came back and asked if we could execute making these to our busy pub. 
We tested Caesar after Caesar until we found the ones easy to get out to
 the table quickly and efficiently.

The Cheasar: Another cocktail on the pub's menu has sandwhiches and cheese sticks attached to it

'We
 became really well-known for our outrageous garnishes - people started 
mentioning us in comments on Instagram and Twitter and other bars 
started trying to do something similar.

'So we decided to create something more outrageous then anything out there but also something we could sell to our guests.

'It
 seems hard to balance but it's actually pretty easy, we just use a few 
skewers and some techniques we've picked up with the heaped-high Caesars
 we already sell.'

Renowned: The bar in Vancouver serves a variety of concoctions and has received worldwide attention as pictures of their creations have been uploaded on social media

Delicious drinking: Their cocktails, which are the Canadian versions of British Bloody Marys, are normally infused with deep fried food

Breakfast blend: One of their specialities includes sausage, bacon, egg and onion rings
