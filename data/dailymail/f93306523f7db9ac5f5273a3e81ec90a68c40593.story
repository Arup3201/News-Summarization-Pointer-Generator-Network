England midfielder Fabian Delph has suffered a freak injury in training and is a major doubt for Aston Villa's match at Everton on Saturday.

Delph took a fall in training and has injured his shoulder at Villa’s Bodymoor Heath complex.

Manager Paul Lambert said Delph was on his own away from teammates when he took a tumble.

Fabian Delph's impressive form for Aston Villa has earned him his first two starts for England this season

Lambert said: 'It was just an awkward fall. We need to get it checked out. He’s a real doubt.' 

Positive news for Lambert though is that captain Ron Vlaar looks certain to return after missing four games with a calf injury.

He will come in for Swiss centre-back Philippe Senderos who was injured on international duty.

And striker Christian Benteke also has a good chance of making his first start after six months out with a ruptured Achilles.
