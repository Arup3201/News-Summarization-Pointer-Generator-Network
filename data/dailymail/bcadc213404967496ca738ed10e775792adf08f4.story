Michelle Knight has revealed how Ariel Castro broke her jaw with a barbell, brutally raped her when she was strung up by metal wire and broke the neck of a puppy he had given her.

The horrifying details emerged in the 33-year-old's book Finding Me which was published on May 6. Along with the brutal physical torture that Castro subjected her to at his Cleveland home, Ms Knight described his emotional punishment, including when he told her: 'You're a person with no meaning.'

On the day that her path crossed with Castro, Ms Knight, who had a troubled upbringing where she suffered sexual abuse, was on her way to a foster-care appointment to try to get her adored two-year-old son Joey back. She had stopped to ask directions at a local store on August 22, 2002, when she ran into the father of a friend - Ariel Castro.

He offered her a ride but said that he needed to stop by his home. He asked if she wanted to come inside, just for a moment, to take one of the puppies he was keeping for her son.

Michelle Knight, pictured during an interview earlier this week, released a memoir on the anniversary of her escape, in which she describes the physical and mental abuse she suffered at the hands of Ariel Castro for 11 years

She told People: 'We stepped into a bedroom. ''The puppies are underneath the dresser,'' he said.

'I looked down to where he was pointing and then, suddenly - Slam! - he closed the door... The gentle guy who'd seemed so nice to me had turned into a madman. He pushed me to the ground. I closed my eyes and tried to prepare myself for what might happen next. To this day I still cannot believe what did.'

Ms Knight was strung from wire in a bedroom where Castro returned two days later to rape her. He then dragged her down two flights of stairs to a basement.

She wrote: 'What happened over the next three hours is still hard for me to think about. He didn't just rape me the way he had upstairs. He murdered my heart.'

Michelle Knight revealed her horrifying ordeal in her new book, published on May 6. An excerpt was included in People, out this week

Castro kept her chained in the dark basement, feeding her stale pizza and repeatedly raping her.

He would make her wear a motorbike helmet so that no one could hear Ms Knight's screams.

At the times she thought he had gone to work, Ms Knight pounded the helmet repeatedly against the pole and rattled the chains in the hope that someone would hear and call the police. As weeks became months, she wrote: 'I began to wonder if God had forgotten me too.'

When he wasn't harming her, Castro forced Knight to listen to his vile diatribes, on how he had had been bullied as a child and hated black people.

Miss Knight wrote how Castro got violent if he caught her watching a show like The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air which had black cast members.

He also enthused about his love of pornography and said: 'I wish I had gotten to that little JonBenet Ramsey first.'

He also made comments about Elizabeth Smart who had disappeared shortly before Ms Knight went missing.

After a few months at the home, Castro brought Michelle a puppy. She named him Lobo and showered him with love. Castro then broke the dog's neck while he was raping the young woman because Lobo would not stop barking.

In April 2003, Castro abducted Amanda Berry, 16, and brought her into the house of horrors.

Ms Knight, who refers to Castro as 'the dude' in her writing, recalled: 'One night Amanda's mother was on the news pleading for people to help find her daughter. The dude laughed. ''You see that? At least someone's looking for her. But who's looking for you? Not a soul. That's because you don't mean nothin' to nobody.'''

Michelle Knight got pregnant five times during her years in captivity but Castro starved and punched her until she miscarried. She also suffered a litany of other health problems. In 2012, she almost died after eating mustard which she was allergic to.

The 33-year-old has trouble speaking at times because her jaw has been left permanently damaged by Castro's punches - including the time he hit her in the face with a barbell. She has nerve damage in her arms which causes them to shake.

Boarded up and now demolished: The three women were held captive in the Cleveland home of Ariel Castro for more than a decade

In April 2004, Gina DeJesus was brought to the home by Castro. He allowed her to be kept in the same room as Michelle and the two girls developed a tight bond - holding each other's hands as he abused them.

In
 an earlier interview, Miss Knight told how Castro would keep her and 
the other women locked in an upstairs room when guests would come to 
visit - blocking them in with piles of furniture.

In 2006, Amanda Berry became pregnant  - but because Castro viewed her as his 'wife', she was not forced to miscarry as Ms Knight had been.

In her book, she writes how she delivered Ms Berry's baby girl Jocelyn on Christmas Day 2006.

As the little girl grew older, Castro loosened their chains, as he didn't want her to see the women locked up. Although they were allowed into the kitchen or living room now for a few hours on the weekend, Ms Knight wrote: 'After years of being in prison the locks move from off of your wrists and your ankles and up to your brain. And it feels like your captor is all-seeing.'

In another harrowing example of 
Castro's mindgames, Miss Knight said that she tried to escape once 
through a door Castro had left open. However, she was just not fast 
enough.

She
 revealed that following this, Castro would leave doors tantalizingly ajar, to tempt them to run, 
only to then shut them in their faces, taunting them.

Finally, on May 6, 2013 - the impossible happened - she was finally free.

Amanda Berry had taken advantage of 
Castro leaving the inner front door unlocked and had screamed through 
the storm door for help. A neighbor heard her and called 911. 

As police officers descended the stairs to their basement prison, Miss Knight 
said she turned to Gina DeJesus to tell her: 'You won't 
believe 
this. We're free. We are going home'.

Then and now: Michelle Knight (left) being interviewed almost one year ago on her escape from captivity and now (right) happier and healthier

Ms Knight was taken to hospital where she weight 84lb and was diagnosed with a bacterial infection that was eating at her stomach.

She said that once she was allowed to eat solid food, she asked for a cheeseburger from Steak n' Shake and a cheesecake blizzard from Dairy Queen. 

Miss Knight said
 that she wanted people to know that her new life is 'awesome'. She said
 that she loved nothing more than waking up in the morning, making a cup
 of coffee, watching TV and looking at the sky.

Miss Knight, who is now known as Lily
 Rose Lee after her favorite flower, said: 'You can't break 
someone that's already been been broken. You can only make them 
stronger.'

Michelle Knight's memoir was released on the first-anniversary of her escape on May 6

She also said that she was enjoying boxing training and singing, even recording her first song.

However her journey to return to the life she was snatched from, hasn't always been easy.

Miss Knight's son Joey was given up for adoption during her 11 years held in captivity by Ariel Castro at his Cleveland home. 

In her book, Miss Knight
 said that it was thinking of her son Joey which kept her alive until 
her dramatic escape.

Michelle
 Knight today said that she understands the decision of her son's new 
family not to share with the 14-year-old the identity of his birth 
mother. 

The
 33-year-old has photographs of 
her son that his new family had shared with her and that she was happy 
to see all that he had accomplished. She added that she hoped to be 
reunited with him one day.

She has chosen not to see her mother to whom she never had a good relationship but hopes one day to have a relationship with her two younger brothers.

Amazingly,
 Miss Knight is available to forgive Castro, who killed himself in prison last September just weeks into his life sentence.

When 
she heard the news of his suicide, she was saddened 
and 'confused why he wanted to hurt his children like that'.

She added: 'He was a human being... and everyone needs to be loved.'

The 33-year-old earlier revealed that she has cut ties with the women she was held captive with for so many dark years.

She told People that the three survivors have put distance between each other as they all come to terms with the ordeal they suffered.

Miss Knight said: 'I love them and they love me. Hopefully we'll all get back together again.' 

Knight had made a brave and defiant 
appearance at Castro's sentencing in August in which she told him: 'I 
spent 11 years in hell, your hell is just beginning.'

Ms Knight, who is 4'11, said that her hellish ordeal has taught her to enjoy every moment of her life.

She told People: 'I don't take things for granted 
anymore not even the little things like looking out a 
window. I went through years of torture, and now I'm back. I'm free to 
fly.' 

Coward: Ariel Castro weeps at his trial in August as he was sentenced to life for holding the three women captive for more than a decade. He killed himself in prison just weeks into his sentence
