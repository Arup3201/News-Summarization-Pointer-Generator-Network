Wedding trends: New York wedding planner Fallon Carter has predicted the 10 trends that will come over from the US this year

At one time all a bride-to-be needed was something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue. 

But nowadays it seems they want a hint of American influence when it comes to planning their wedding.

Far from the bog-standard finger buffets, couples are now looking for more adventurous ways to entertain their reception guests, inspired by celebrity ceremonies across the pond.

And from receptions with temporary tattoo stations and food trucks to upside-down tiered cakes for dessert, New York wedding planner Fallon Carter has predicted the 10 trends that will come over from the US this year.

They range from the traditional, including the return of the veil, as worn by the Duchess of Cambridge, Kim Kardashian and Beyoncé, to the quirky and modern, such as personal branded invites featuring Twitter hashtags.

For those on a tight budget, Miss Carter recommended the ‘cocktail reception’, which avoids the cost of a sit-down dinner, or mini pies instead of a cake, which might end up going to waste. 

She also said she expects to see a rise in clients asking for a ‘man caves’ where the groom and his male guest can retire, or temporary tattoo stations for the young at heart.

An upside-down chandelier cake can provide a talking point for guests at dinner, while food trucks on the lawn will be popular among grazers.

And Miss Carter said there will be a surge in aerial photography being used to capture the big day from a helicopter.

The rise in alternative wedding trends follows American celebrity ceremonies which have strayed from the traditional.

When Britney Spears married Kevin Federline, she gave her bridesmaids Juicy Couture tracksuits as gifts, while guests at Nicole Ritchie’s wedding included a live elephant.

According to Miss Carter, British weddings will start to feature more and more American twists. And her predictions for this year’s top trends feature in the latest edition of You & Your Wedding magazine.

Last night the magazine’s editor-in-chief, Maxine Briggs, said: ‘The US wedding industry is worth a reported $51 billion, so it’s no big surprise the Americans lead the way when it comes to big-day innovations. 

'We’ve seen US traditions like bridesmaids walking down the aisle first and rehearsal dinners steadily becoming more popular here. 

'Now UK brides are branching out from British traditions in their reception décor and food too, opting for the more personalised and elaborate ideas they’ve seen their American counterparts showcasing - often inspired by big-budget or A-list celebrations stateside.’

The trends range from the traditional, including the return of the veil, as worn by the Duchess of Cambridge, to the quirky and modern

1. The Chandelier Cake: A tiered cake turned upside down.

Miss Carter said: ‘I recently worked with Haute So Sweet bakery to create one – it took a lot of weighing, measuring and praying, but it was worth it. It definitely gets guests talking.

2. The return of the Veil: As seen on the Duchess of Cambridge, Kim Kardashian and Beyoncé

Miss Carter said: ‘I recommend that every bride try one on. This is the only time you’ll be able to wear one, so at least give it a go before saying no.’

3. Cocktail receptions: The alternative to a sit-down dinner, to be served with canapé-style bites

Miss Carter said: ‘It’s a great way to save money. Communicate with your guests that a full meal won’t be served and have fun with your catering.’

4. The alternative cake: Serve mini pies, cookies or cobblers instead of a traditional wedding cake

Miss Carter said: ‘Cake often goes to waste as guests are usually dancing and forget to eat their slice. This is more economical and less wasteful. Ensure you have at least two options per guest.’

5. Floral wristlets: Instead of a traditional bouquet

Miss Carter said: ‘Celebrity event planner Diann Valentine created these bouquet-alternatives for her reality TV star brides and I’ve worked with florist Nicosia Perry to create orchid wristlets. Use sturdy flowers and bold colours.’

6. Temporary tattoos: As an unusual take on a wedding favour

Miss Carter said: ‘Somehow temporary tattoos will never get old. Include a sponge, spray bottle of water, handheld mirror and application instructions.’

7. Man caves: Give the groom something to do by letting him arrange a male-only area for smoking cigars and drinking bourbon.

Miss Carter said: ‘Having different areas under one roof keeps the party interesting. If you aren’t into whiskey consider a vodka bar with an ice sculpture, or a decadent dessert room.’

8. Personal branding: Save the dates and invitations with a twist

Miss Carter said: ‘Think social media hashtags, a custom monogram or logo and even symbols, colours and motifs that are used everywhere for a cohesive décor scheme.’

9. Food trucks: Keep guests satisfied all night and helps prevent drunkenness

Miss Carter said: ‘In America, the hot options are Mister Softee ice cream trucks and delicacies like truffle fries and mini mac’n’cheese, but the possibilities are endless.’

10. Aerial photography: Capturing the day from a helicopter

Miss Carter: ‘It’s still very new, but I see this being a big trend, especially for destination weddings, where there’s a lot to be seen from above.’
