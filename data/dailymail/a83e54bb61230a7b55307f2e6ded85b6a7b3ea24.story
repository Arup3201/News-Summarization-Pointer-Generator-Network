Authority: The former top tax official in the country, Dave Hartnett, has accepted a job with major accountancy firm Deloitte

The former taxman whose ‘sweetheart deals’ allowed Starbucks and Vodafone to avoid billions in payments sparked fury yesterday by switching sides to work for the firms’ accountants.

Dave Hartnett was attacked over his lucrative contract with City giant Deloitte, which he has accepted just ten months after retiring from his post as head of HM Revenue and Customs. 

Experts said the move raises serious questions about the ‘cosy’ relationship between the Revenue and big companies accused of tax avoidance.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, accused Mr Hartnett of ‘greed’ and ‘losing all sense of what is right’.

Critics said it was little surprise that the  62-year-old had been ‘welcomed with open arms’ by the same firm which had helped big business avoid huge amounts of tax every year.

Deloitte dismissed any suggestion that Mr Hartnett had been hired to reveal insider secrets of how to beat the taxman and insisted there was no conflict of interest in the appointment.

Mr Hartnett’s tenure at HMRC, which ended last July, was dogged by claims that he helped multinational companies shave millions of pounds off their tax bills.

He was severely criticised for brokering a deal that saved Goldman Sachs £20million in interest payments. The deal was described by a judge last month as lawful, but ‘not a glorious episode in the history of the Revenue’.

Another time, Mr Hartnett allowed Vodafone – a Deloitte client – to pay £1.25billion of an alleged £6billion tax bill – figures which are disputed by the telecoms company.

After being accused of lying to MPs last year, Mr Hartnett left HMRC and joined HSBC as an adviser on honesty.

He has now accepted a one-day-a-week 
post with Deloitte – the firm that signed off the accounts for coffee 
chain Starbucks which, entirely legally, paid no corporation tax for 
three years by channelling its revenues through Luxembourg and 
Switzerland.

During his time as HMRC boss, Mr 
Hartnett met Deloitte’s senior British partner David Cruickshank 48 
times between 2007 and 2011, including meetings about Vodafone.

Mr Hartnett’s appointment with 
Deloitte was approved by David Cameron and the advisory committee set up
 to monitor the ‘revolving door’ between Whitehall and money-spinning 
jobs in the private sector.

It is subject to six caveats, 
including a requirement to ensure Mr Hartnett does not ‘draw on 
privileged information’ from his time at HMRC.

But Mrs Hodge said: ‘Doesn’t it make 
you sick? It is terrible when people’s individual greed means they lose 
all sense of what’s right.

‘He better than most knows this isn’t 
about paying a fair share of tax and playing by the rules. It is about 
manipulating the rules and aggressively avoiding tax.

‘We always called the deals he reached sweetheart deals. Maybe now we understand why.’

Fellow Labour MP John Mann added: ‘It shouldn’t be allowed.’

Murray Wood, spokesman for the group 
UK Uncut, which campaigns against corporate tax avoidance, said: ‘It is 
no surprise Dave Hartnett has been welcomed with open arms by a company 
which has helped firms like Starbucks avoid huge amounts of tax every 
year.

‘Governments have for years had a far 
too cosy relationship with giant corporate tax dodgers and the tax 
avoidance industry. It means the UK is losing out on millions of pounds 
of revenue which could be spent on public services.’

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of 
the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘David Hartnett’s appointment doesn’t 
look good given how the Revenue appeared to reach decisions in a number 
of controversial cases, especially while many others were left to 
struggle under the weight of Britain’s hideously complex  tax code.’

Deloitte pledged that Mr Hartnett ‘will not work with UK companies or with HMRC’ in his new role.

A spokesman said: ‘He will work as a 
consultant to Deloitte advising foreign governments and tax 
administrations, primarily in the developing world.

‘He has significant experience in advising such countries on the development of effective tax regimes.’

Advice: Starbucks and Vodafone, which have both faced questions over their tax in the UK, are advised by Deloitte which has just hired Mr Hartnett

Yesterday the Cabinet Office said Mr Hartnett had ‘complied with the rules’.

Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘The 
recommendation was made by the entirely independent Advisory Committee 
on Business Appointments, and the Prime Minister follows their advice.’

It approved the appointment subject to
 conditions stipulating Mr Hartnett must not advise ‘any taxpayer that 
he has been involved with whilst at HMRC’, nor have ‘involvement in 
discussions with other fiscal authorities of UK’s confidential tax 
policy’. However, critics pointed out that a condition banning him from 
‘lobbying Government’ on behalf of Deloitte expires in July 2014.

Paul Flynn, a Labour member of the 
Commons public administration committee, branded the advisory body ‘a 
pussy cat without teeth or claws’ and ‘virtually completely useless’.

He said: ‘It’s not what people do when
 they retire that is the problem, it’s what they did when they were in 
office. They may well take a soft line on the commercial companies that 
they hope to be employed by post-retirement.

‘The revolving door is more corrupt than the financial scandals we’ve had.’

There was no answer at Mr Hartnett’s £800,000 home near St Albans last night.
