A couple who trafficked vulnerable young women into the UK and forced them into sham marriages have been jailed for three years

Abdullah Saleem and his wife Anna Styputkowska were the ringleaders of a bogus marriage operation in Slough, Berkshire, where they used false advertisements of well-paid jobs to entice girls from Poland.

The girls were then set up with non-EU men who 24-year-old Saleem had lined up.

The pair were caught after one of three girls they had brought to the UK, Estera Sztogryn, who believed she was going to be working as a cleaner, escaped from a house where they were holding her.

After being arrested and then released on bail, Saleem and 21-year-old Styputkowska tried to flea the country but were apprehended at Dover where officials discovered them hiding in the back of a lorry bound for France.

Sentencing the couple at Reading Crown Court, Judge Zoe Smith said arranging sham marriages to get around immigration rules was a very serious offence.

Fake adverts were placed on Polish websites and Facebook to tempt girls into moving to the UK.

The prosecution said three girls were found when police swooped on houses in Slough, Berkshire, that were part of the ring. All from poor backgrounds and needed money.

One of them, 21-year-old Estera, needed money to pay for her mother’s cancer treatment.

She arrived in the UK on August 28 last year, where she was met by the defendants at Luton Airport and taken to a house in Whitby Road, Slough, where Saleem and Styputkowska lived.

Prosecutor Wendy Hewitt said: 'At that point she was still under the impression that the employment and accommodation would involve something like cleaning.'

She was allowed out of the house at times but only under supervision.

Estera first became alarmed about what was going on when she overheard the defendants talking about transferring her to another house and raised her fears with Styputkowska.

Miss Hewitt said: 'The conversation goes along the lines of ‘don’t make us angry about this’.

'The following day she is told to pack and the Crown says it is made plain that she is not to argue with them any longer about it.''She became tearful about it. She is told she has to go along with it.'

The girl was then taken to a house in Tintern Close, Slough, where she was left with another man, who told her she would have to have sex with her new husband to make the marriage appear real.

Estera was able to escape from the house on August 30 and call police, who then raided both addresses.

Case: Reading Crown Court heard that Styputkowska had herself originally been brought to the UK as part of a sham marriage arrangement but 'didn¿t like the look of' the man she was expected to marry.

At the Whitby Road home they found two other Polish girls, Justyna Hajkowska, aged 18 years, and Barbara Dzielak, aged 27 years.

They had originally been going to take part in a sham marriage in Ireland but did not like the arrangements and got in touch with Styputkowska after remembering her advert.

The defendants were arrested and interviewed on September 2 before being released on bail.

On September 8 they were found with 23 other people in the back of the lorry headed for France and arrested again.

'They were both trying to leave the country before any further steps could be taken in these proceedings,' said Miss Hewitt.

The court heard that Styputkowska had herself originally been brought to the UK as part of a sham marriage arrangement but 'didn’t like the look of' the man she was expected to marry. She then met Saleem and they married legitimately.

The prosecutor said there was no evidence any marriages had actually taken place as part of the defendants’ arrangement or that any money had changed hands.

Defending a tearful Styputkowska, Kate Hughes said: 'My client is regretful of the choices she has made.

'She looks forward to living a completely crime free life upon release.'

Saleem’s defence representative, Stephen Butt, said it had not been a large conspiracy and not many people were involved.

At a hearing on December 16 the pair pleaded guilty to conspiracy to do an act to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law.
