Wine sold for upwards of $15,000 a bottle was stolen from the French Laundry in Napa Valley, a restaurant that has twice been named the best in the world.

The theft occurred on Christmas Day at Chef Thomas Keller's famed restaurant that is known for twice daily serving nine-course tasting menus, none of which uses the same ingredient more than once. 

Keller released a statement saying Domaine de la Romanée-Conti and Screaming Eagle wines were stolen.

Grinch: The proprietor of the French Laundry restaurant revealed Tuesday the restaurant had been robbed of $300,000 worth of wine during a Christmas Day break-in

'The French Laundry wine program is, as many of you know, singular and distinct,' he wrote on Instagram. 'We are confident that if and when any of the stolen bottles appear in public, they will immediately raise questions and red flags among the wine knowledgeable.'

Grubstreet notes that 63 of the 76 bottles stolen bore the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti label including vintages that auction on the private market for several thousand dollars each--up to $15,000 or more.

Certain vintages of another beloved label sold at French Laundry, California's Screaming Eagle, retails for over $7,000 a pop.

Sadly, the theft occurred just a day after the beloved restaurant served its final meal for the indefinite future.

The Christmas Eve closure came as the 20-year-old restaurant embarks on a series of renovations and changes including a ticketing system and state lottery for diners hopeful to get a seat at an establishment bombarded by hundreds of reservations phone calls per day. 

Knew what he was after: Most of the 76 stolen bottles bore the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti label.  Some vintages of these wines can auction for $15,000

Chef Thomas Keller remained confident the authorities would find the culprit, who broke in just a day after French Laundry served its last customer for an indefinite amount of time to undertake renovations

In 2003 and 2004 the French Laundry was named best restaurant in the world by Restaurant Magazine. Police are investigating.

In his posts, Chef Thomas' remained confident that, given the rarity of the wines, the culprit will be brought to justice.

'We have complete trust in the authorities leading the investigation, and we welcome any information our community may have regarding the event,' he said.

And if they never get their precious trove back? Chef simply doesn't see that happening.

'We look forward to rebuilding our cellar in the meantime and plan to get to the bottom of this disheartening act immediately.'

'We are confident that if and when any of the stolen bottles appear in public, they will immediately raise questions and red flags among the wine knowledgeable,' Chef Keller said of his boosted vintage wine
