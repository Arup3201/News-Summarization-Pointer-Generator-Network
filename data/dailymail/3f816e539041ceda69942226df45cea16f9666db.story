Attack: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin criticised the U.S. at a youth camp yesterday

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has launched a scathing attack on the United Stated and accused them of being a 'parasite' on the world economy.

Putin said the superpower was living beyond its means 'like a parasite' and said dollar dominance was a threat to the financial markets.     

The remarks from Russia - one of the world's strongest emerging markets - comes amid speculation that the struggling U.S. will this week have its AAA credit rating downgraded.  

'They are living beyond their means and shifting a part of the weight of their problems to the world economy,' Putin said.

'They are living like parasites off the global economy and their monopoly of the dollar,' he told the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi today.

US President Barack Obama earlier announced a last-ditch deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling and avoid a crushing default that would have repercussions around the world.         

The deal initially soothed anxieties and led Russian stocks to jump to three-month highs, but jitters remained over the possibility of a credit downgrade.        

'Thank god,' Putin said, 'that they had enough common sense and responsibility to make a balanced decision.'       

But Putin, who has often criticised the United States’ foreign exchange policy, noted that Russia holds a large amount of U.S. bonds and treasuries.        

'If over there (in America) there is a systemic malfunction,  this will affect everyone,' Putin told the young Russians.      

'Countries like Russia and China hold a significant part of their reserves in American securities ... There should be other reserve currencies.'     

U.S.-Russian ties soured during Putin’s 2000-2008 presidency but have warmed significantly since his protege and successor President Dmitry Medvedev responded to Obama’s stated desire for a 'reset' in bilateral relations.   

Talking tough: Putin poses as he take part in arm wrestling during his visit to the Summer camp. During the visit he said that the U.S. was effectively punching above their weight on the world stage

Putin's attack on the U.S. comes as lawmakers there passed an 11th-hour bill last night to raise the U.S. lending limit and avoid a calamitous debt default.

Despite successfully passing the rescue package, the President must now deal with criticism from both sides of the aisle over the uneasy compromises that were made to pass the legislation.

Both Republicans and Democrats saw the bill as an unpalatable necessity and were only able to reach acceptable terms after weeks of bickering and brinkmanship.

The deal thrashed out between party 
leaders will see America’s legal ‘debt ceiling’ rise by up to 
£1.46trillion – from the £8.71trillion limit it formally reaches today –
 which will take the country beyond the election and into 2013.

More bad economic news and finger-pointing in Washington quickly overshadowed early optimism on Wall Street over the debt deal – with fears persisting that America will still see its credit rating downgraded this week.

Putin criticised the U.S. during a trip 
to the youth group Nashi while he was touring its lakeside summer camp 
some five hours drive north of Moscow. 

Commentators said that the swipe at the 
ailing U.S. economy looked like early campaigning before parliamentary 
and presidential polls.

Partner: Putin may not stand aside for President Dmitry Medvedev (pictured)   

Casually dressed in khaki trousers and a striped white shirt, Putin flew by helicopter to the tented camp as part of a string of appearances that are being closely watched in the run-up to the elections.            

He did not say whether he plans a return to the Kremlin or will stand aside for Medvedev, his partner in Russia’s leadership tandem, to run for a second term.        

But young people crowding round Putin, caught up in the campaigning spirit created by huge portraits of Putin hung from trees, were not shy about saying who they wanted as president.  

'Russia’s next president will be small, bald and look like Putin,' 17-year-old Ilya Mzokov joked with reporters. Asked why Medvedev was not paying a visit to the summer camp, he said: 'Only serious people come here.'

Youngsters chanted Putin’s name and applauded his remarks as he strolled round the camp, where US-style business seminars, extreme sports and political mudslinging were among the topics on offer.         

Putin, whose macho image appeals to many Russians, briefly swung himself up the first half of a climbing wall, filmed by a gaggle of state television cameras.     

Nashi, which means 'Our People', was created by the Kremlin to counter popular dissent after youth activism helped topple a pro-Moscow government in Ukraine’s 2005 Orange revolution.        

The group has worked to spread a personality cult around Putin and regularly campaigns against Kremlin critics.          

Opinion polls show Putin, still widely viewed as the country’s paramount leader, retains near 70 percent approval.         

But his United Russia party is trying to reverse a slide in popularity before December parliamentary polls, hoping to use a strong showing there to help Putin in the March 2012 presidential vote.
