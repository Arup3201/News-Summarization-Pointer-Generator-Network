An 86-year-old man who shot and killed his 83-year-old wife in her hospice bed before turning the gun on himself had decided he couldn't live without her, authorities believe.

Elwood Osman shot dead his beloved wife of 64 years, Mildred Osman, on the fourth floor of Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania shortly after 1 p.m. on Tuesday.

Staff heard gunshots and when they entered the room, they found Mrs Osman dead in her bed and the body of her husband, in what authorities are calling a murder-suicide.

Relatives have described how the couple 
were inseparable, and how Mr Osman had struggled to cope after his wife suffered a stroke earlier this month. She moved to the hospice last week.

'Madly in love': Relatives said that the couple was inseparable and acted like teenagers in love

Mrs Osman was left paralysed on her left side and could not walk, feed herself or go to the bathroom alone, her family members told WFMZ.

Her husband was left 'absolutely devastated, completely beside himself,' according to the couple's granddaughter, Sarah Kehm. '[He] had no idea what to do.'

She said that, even in their 80s, they looked like a young couple in love.

'They were madly, madly in love with each other,' she told WFMZ.

Their daughter, Linda Mullin, added: 'They were always together. Never went anywhere without each other.'

Happy days: The Osmans, who were married 64 years, are pictured on their wedding day in the 1940s

Family: The couple lived in Allentown, Pennsylvania, surrounded by their family, including their children

Hospital authorities agreed Mr Osman shot dead his wife as he could not cope without her.

'It's a love story,' James Geiger, senior vice president of the hospital, said. 'The elderly gentleman could 
not bear to see his wife suffering, and the family, I believe, have 
observed that he just could not envision living without her.'

The Lehigh County coroner's office said autopsies on both are 
scheduled for Wednesday, but authorities said each had a single gun shot wound.

Geiger added that he was not aware of any note left behind.

In love: Relatives said Mr Osman was 'beside himself' when his wife suffered a debilitating stroke on March 1

Nothing without her: Mr Osman shot himself because he could not imagine life without her, authorities said

Clues: Neighbours near their home, pictured, said Mr Osman had been upset to put his wife in the hospice

No other patients or staff members were harmed or threatened, and the hospital wasn't evacuated, officials said.

No one witnessed the shooting, and the man gave hospital staff no 
indication that he was about to harm his wife, who had entered the 
hospice more than a week ago, said police Capt. Glen Dorney.

'The first thing that drew their attention was the sound of the 
gunshot,' he said. 'They heard a second gunshot and came to 
investigate.'

Like most hospitals, Lehigh Valley Hospital doesn't use metal 
detectors to screen visitors, though wands are used when hospital 
security has reason to believe a patient has a weapon, Geiger said.

'Murder suicide': Authorities respond to the scene at Lehigh Valley Hospital on Tuesday afternoon

Shock: Staff at the hospital said Mr Osman gave no indication of the tragedy that was to follow

Crime scene: Police vehicles outside the Pennsylvania hospice, where Mrs Osman had been for a week

Patients in the hospice unit are 
those with a terminal illness, those with less than six months to live 
and those who wish to be comfortable rather than cured, according to the
 hospital's website.

Staff at the hospital expressed their sadness at the shooting on Tuesday afternoon.

'This is a very tragic event and our
 hearts go out to the family of the deceased and our Lehigh Valley 
Health Network colleagues who were involved,' the hospital said in a 
press release.
