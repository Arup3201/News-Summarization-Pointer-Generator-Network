Model Abbey Clancy is furthering her fashion credentials as she designs and poses in another clothing collection for Matalan, giving the brand some serious va va voom.

The ‘Abbey by Abbey Clancy’ range designed by the Strictly star features statement maxi gowns as well as bodycon dresses and - of course - Abbey's favourite slinky LBDs.

Like phase one of her collection, which was launched in October, the fashion forward look is a far cry from Matalan's regular ranges, which are generally considered cheap and cheerful.

The 27-year-old, who has been wowing audiences on Strictly Come Dancing in recent weeks, shows off the results of a gruelling dance regime in the pictures.

In an exclusive selection of images from the shoot the mother-of-one channels '70s glamour, evoking images of Jerry Hall in her heyday with her bright red lips and her long blonde hair wild and loose around her face. 

Abbey has previously designed bikinis for the retailer - leading to a 30 per cent rise in sales.

Abbey says of her latest venture into the fashion world: ‘I am so excited about the next stage of my collection.

‘I
wanted to include more staple classics within the range that can be 
dressed up or down, including the racer back dress and timeless LBD which
has always been my reliable go to wardrobe piece.’

Abbey has previously named Kate Moss, Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as her style inspirations, Abbey wears maxi dress £20

Speaking previously about her celebrity fashion inspirations, Abbey said: 'I am a massive Bridget Bardot fan! I love her. My fashion icons now… I love Blake Lively, and the way she dresses, I just think she is gorgeous, she always looks amazing, dead girlie and sexy.

'And of course Kate Moss always looks amazing. And love Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.'
