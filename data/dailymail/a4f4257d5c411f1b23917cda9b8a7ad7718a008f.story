West Ham manager Sam Allardyce received a huge boost on Tuesday night when influential midfielder Alex Song announced his international retirement, meaning he will be available to play in Barclays Premier League and FA Cup matches for his club this month rather than participating in the Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon.

Allardyce was at Goodison Park speaking about his side's 1-1 FA Cup third-round draw against Everton when news broke that Song had told his national association that he didn't want to play for them any more.

The Hammers manager had to choose his words carefully so that he or West Ham couldn't be deemed by FIFA to be putting any pressure on the player but he will be delighted at the prospect of Song returning home from Cameroon in time for their match against Swansea on Saturday.

Alex Song released a statement on his Instagram page detailing the reasons for his decision 

Song has starred for West Ham this season since his loan-move from Barcelona during the summer

Allardyce said: 'Alex is doing his own talking over there in terms of what they want from him and what is expected of him.

'He is going to make a decision with the manager or has made a decision with the manager on what the situation is.'

Song, 27, then clarified the situation by announcing on Instagram: 'I have taken the decision to retire from International football.'

The Barcelona midfielder, on loan at Upton Park, was disappointed to be originally left out of the Cameroon squad for the Africa Cup of Nations even though they then tried to make a U-turn. 

'Since the World Cup in the summer and my subsequent exclusion from the Cameroon squad for the Africa Cup of Nations I have taken the decision to retire from international football,' he said.

'It is true that there were some discussions of late to include me in the squad for this tournament but I feel after a lot of careful thought and numerous discussions with my family this (international retirement) is the right decision. 

'My love for my country will never change but I want to take time to focus purely on domestic football and start to rebuild my career at West Ham United. I wish Cameroon all the best and the team will always be in my heart.'

It is great news for Allardyce who face Swansea, Hull, Liverpool and Manchester United in the Premier League and Everton in an FA Cup replay while the Africa Cup of Nations takes place in Equatorial Guinea. He is already without midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate who will represent Senegal. 

The Senegal FA have accepted striker Diafra Sakho can't go because of a back injury that Allardyce expects to keep him out for several weeks.

Alladyce felt his side were unlucky not to progress at Goodison having taken a second-half lead through James Collins but for Everton boss Roberto Martinez, the injury-time equaliser by Romelu Lukaku was a potentially season-defining moment after a run of four defeats.

'It was real satisfaction rather than relief,' he said. 'We could have felt sorry for ourselves but we kept the right attitude and frame of mind. It could create a snowball reaction because a result like this gives you confidence. It felt like a win and the finish and contribution from Rom (Lukaku) was very good.'

Allardyce has seen Lukaku score in four successive games against his team. 'It is always seems to be him,' grimaced the Hammers boss after the Belgian had turned in Bryan Oviedo's cross.

'But we should have scored at 1-0. Enner Valencia had a chance that players of his quality normally score.'
