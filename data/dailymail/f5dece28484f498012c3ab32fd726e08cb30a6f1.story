Sunrise co-host David 'Kochie' Koch has been bombarded with abusive comments on social media in what seems to be a case of mistaken identity.

The TV personality asked any Twitter followers from the States on Friday to 'unfollow' him if they believed him to be the conservative American businessman of the same name.

'Okay. Any followers from US. Listen carefully. I am NOT one of your Koch brothers. I am a bloke from Australia. Unfollow and leave me alone’, the financial commentator wrote.

Australian TV personality David Koch has been receiving abuse on Twitter from people who believe him to be someone else

The Sunrise host sent out this tweet on Friday in an attempt to make it clear to others they had him mistaken

He has been mistaken for conservative American billionaire, also called David Koch but pronounced differently

Australia's David Koch co-hosts popular morning TV program Sunrise on the Seven Network with Samantha Armytage.

The pair host the show which covers news, current affairs, and often hosts guests for segments and performances. 

Kochie is also chairman of the Port Adelaide Football club and hosts his own show on the weekend called Kochie's Business Builders.

American Koch brothers David and Charlie are known for their huge influence and massive donations to conservative organisations, and just last week it was announced that their political network will spend nearly $900 million during the 2016 US campaign cycle.

David and Charlie are two of Fred Koch's sons - a chemical engineer and later founder of Koch Industries.

The second largest privately owned company in the US, Koch Industries primarily deals with oil but has numerous other ventures.

The brothers' Koch Industries produces everything from Dixie cups and toilet paper to jet fuel and fertilizer. They're personally tied for fourth place on Forbes magazine's list of the wealthiest Americans, with assets estimated at $41.5 billion each.   

Another company founded by David Koch is Americans For Prosperity and is reportedly one of the largest not-for-profit organisations funding the Tea Party Movement. 

The American billionaire, 75, does not seem to be active on social media, nor does his brother Charles - who turns 80 this year.
