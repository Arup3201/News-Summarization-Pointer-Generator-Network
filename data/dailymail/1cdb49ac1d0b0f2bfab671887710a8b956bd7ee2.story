Army Captains Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr hold no grudges against their wedding crasher - President Obama.  

The military couple planned to get married on the 16th tee box of the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course on Sunday, but learned the day before their ceremony that it would have to be moved because the president was in town and wanted to play the course with his friends.

On Tuesday, the couple spoke with the Today show to make it clear that they were not upset with the president for the wedding day surprise.

Happily married: On Tuesday, the couple spoke with the Today Show and said they were not at all upset at the last minute change of plans 

'We knew that there were two things that could mess up the wedding and one was weather and the other was the president,' Heimel told Today. Couples who plan their ceremony on the course are allegedly warned that the president can cause last minute changes of plans 

'I'm sure that his staffers didn't let him know that there was a wedding.'

The president claimed he didn't know his golf game interrupted their wedding when he called the couple just after they said 'I do' on Sunday. 

Their wedding instead took place on the green lawn of the military base where the golf course is located, and has an even better view of the ocean than their original location.

'Congratulations on your wedding. I feel terrible. Nobody told us. I hope the wedding went ok anyway,' the president told the newlyweds. 

'It did, thank you very much' Mallue responded. 'It was a blessing in disguise.'

The president went on to say that if he had known, he could have just skipped the 16th hole, and ended the day with a better score.

He revealed to the couple that he shot an 84, and would have pulled a 79 if he just skipped the tricky 16th hole.

On Tuesday, avid-golfer Mallue joked that he could 'probably' beat Obama on the Marine Corps course. 

When asked by Today if they wanted to 'yell' at Obama after hearing their wedding would be moved, Heimel said 'Not at all'.

Heimel and Mallue both attended the prestigious United States Military Academy at West Point, and met while stationed in Germany in 2011. They have both served tours of duty in Afghanistan.

They are putting off plans for a Honeymoon for now, instead spending some time with their wedding guests on the island of Oahu for the New Year.

The bride and groom learned of the decision the day before their ceremony was planned to take place at the 16th tee box of the course, which has picturesque views of the Pacific Ocean. 

Ironically, the couple knew the president would be in town and sent him an invite on a whim, and received a polite decline just hours before they learned they could no longer get married at their desired location. 

'It was emotional, especially for [Heimel]—she’s the bride and in less than 24 hours they had to change everything they had planned,' the groom's sister Jamie McCarthy told Bloomberg.

The wedding instead took place on the green lawn of the Marine Corps base where the golf course is located, and many attendants posted pictures of the ceremony online with the hashtag #ThanksObama. 

President Obama and his family are currently vacationing on his home state of Hawaii for the Christmas holidays, and he has played golf six times in the past nine days. 

On Sunday, he played the Kaneohe Klipper course with friends Mike Ramos, Greg Orme and Bobby Titcomb.
