Gwyneth might be the most beautiful, but Mila Kunis is the sexiest woman in the world, according to FHM.

The actress – who is dating Ashton Kutcher  - beat 99 other female celebrities from across the globe to top the 2013 poll, taking the crown from the Brits for the first time in four years.

In last year's list, Mila, 29, was placed at number 14, but after starring in Ted, Oz: The Great And Powerful, and Friends With Benefits, it's no surprise she's gone up to number one.

FHM 100 Sexiest Editor, Dan Jude said: 'Not only is [Mila] naturally stunning, but she has a great sense of humour and isn’t afraid to poke fun at herself. 

'The nation has spoken, and the verdict is that she is officially the perfect girlfriend.'

Surprisingly, Helen Flanagan was named Britain's sexiest woman by FHM readers.

But what isn’t a surprise, is the 
ex-Corrie star’s reaction to the win:

‘I'm absolutely thrilled to be 
voted the Sexiest Woman In the UK. It's a lovely confidence boost, 
especially when there are so many beautiful girls out there.’

‘Rosie Webster would definitely be impressed!’ the 22-year old exclaimed.

Obviously
 the constant photo shoots and saucy Instagram pictures have paid off 
for Helen, who leads the majority of Brits making up the top 100.

Rihanna, 25, takes the runner-up spot, rising one place from her 2012 result. but there were more UK entrants than ever before with 53 of the 100 women from the home countries, compared to 46 last year.

Three
 of these new entries were 19-year-old Perrie Edwards from Little Mix at
 55, BBC Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid, 42, at number 96, and 
interior designer and TV personality Linda Barker.
