It  was the night after Liverpool had been put to the sword by Manchester United and Raheem Sterling was at home in turmoil.

He was trying to unwind by watching television but his mind was back at Old Trafford.

Sterling had squandered three glorious chances during a 3-0 defeat that left Liverpool in 10th place and he felt personally responsible.

Some players are able to move on swiftly but Sterling had been sent clips of his duel with David de Gea by Liverpool’s analytics department and he wanted to see how he had been outwitted, so he pressed ‘Play’. He watched them so much it was as if they were on a permanent loop.

It made uncomfortable viewing, but triggered the required response. On December 14, Sterling had just three goals to his credit but he will face Besiktas in the Europa League this evening having moved his tally impressively to 10. That bleak afternoon in Manchester was a watershed.

‘That day for me was massive,’ said the England international.

‘I had a few chances to win us the game and I missed them. I was devastated. I went home and watched the clips over and over again. I watched it just to see what I could have done better.

‘United was a low day because everyone at this club wants to win those games and I had missed the chances that would have helped us do that. It was definitely a real low and I had to pick myself up quickly.’

Sterling responded by scoring a brace in Liverpool's next game, a 2-0 FA Cup victory against Bournemouth

Two goals immediately after at Bournemouth, in a Capital One Cup quarter-final, helped rebuild his confidence but it was his finish in the Boxing Day win at Burnley that demonstrated progress; when Philippe Coutinho sent him scurrying through on goal, he didn’t look like missing.

‘The manager told me I was up front against Bournemouth and I was really focused,’ Sterling explained. ‘I wanted to improve my finishing and said next time I will be a bit more relaxed.

‘I said to myself the next time I get into the position like I did against United that I would just stay calm if that chance came.

‘My form has been a bit stop-start but for a young player it is natural. If I want to get to the next level, I need to be consistent. I have got 10 goals but I could easily have had 15 if I’d taken half of my chances. When the penny drops hopefully that will improve my game.’

Sterling has been a hot topic for much of Liverpool’s season, primarily because the contract he has been offered by the club — one which Brendan Rodgers recently described as ‘a wonderful deal’ — remains unsigned. The 20-year-old, however, insists it is not a distraction.

‘I speak to my representative every day and he has told me to concentrate on playing football and he and the club will deal with it,’ said Sterling.

‘Hopefully it will be done soon. I’m focused on winning games and trying to do my best for this football club.’

It remains to be seen whether Sterling starts as Liverpool look to defend their 1-0 first-leg lead as Rodgers will need to make changes, given that his side face Manchester City 56 hours after they return from Istanbul.

Rodgers travelled to Turkey without 10 established players, including Jordan Henderson (ankle), Steven Gerrard and the rested Philippe Coutinho, and he accepted that Manuel Pellegrini’s side will have an advantage for a game which will start at noon.

‘There wasn’t a great deal we could do about it,’ said Rodgers. ‘The Europa League is tough, especially when you don’t get help. It is unfortunate but we will do our best.’
