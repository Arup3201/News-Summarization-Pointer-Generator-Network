It is the annual stock take that sees workers note down each and every one of the 17,000 residents at London Zoo.

The mammoth task takes staff a week to complete and tiny creatures such as ants and locusts are, thankfully, counted in colonies.

The zoo is home to more than 750 species, from red-kneed spiders to Sumatran tigers, and all must be accounted for. 

The yearly stock-taking is required under the license terms for all British zoos and means workers have to coax, corral and count each resident in the famous zoo.

New arrivals this year include 10 young Humboldt penguins, three tiger cubs and six baby Philippine crocodiles - the first of the reptiles ever bred in Britain.

The count is expected to take about a week. Tiny creatures such as ants and locusts are counted in colonies, but all others are recorded individually.

'You need a quick pair of eyes,' said zookeeper Amy Heath as she counted a group of skittering squirrel monkeys. 

'Usually an extra pair of eyes helps, but I've been counting them for quite a few years, so I'm quite good at counting them.'

Data from the count, and others around the country, will be entered into an international computer database of animal collections and used to plan zoo management and breeding programs for endangered species.
