A Chinese builder survived an horrific accident which saw a foot long metal bar impaled in his head.

Jin Hongping was working in the city of Linxia in northwest China's Ganua province, when the 40 cm bar dropped from a height and went through his skull.

The bar entered the back of Mr Hongping's neck and exited from the corner of his right eye.

The builder was rushed to hospital where emergency staff had to call on firefighters to cut the bar.

Horrific injuries: Amazingly builder Jin Hongping survived being impaled through the head with a 40cm metal bar

Delicate emergency surgery saw the bar removed from Mr Hongping's head.

He is said to be in a critical but stable condition in hospital.

Mr Hongping is not the first Chinese worker to suffer such horrific injuries this year.

Back in January, a 17-year-old intern
at a factory in northern China's Hebei Province was seriously hurt when
a heavy metal file fell on his head and became embedded in his head.

He was diligently working away when 
the 35cm long file, shaped like a spike, was dropped from high above and
plunged point first into the top of his head.

Wang was rushed to hospital where 
x-rays revealed that the 35cm long file had penetrated 3cm through his 
skull and into his brain.

To remove the file doctors first cut off the protruding length before drilling out a 3cm round section from Wang's head.

The city of Linxia, where Mr Hongping's accident happened, was previously known as Hezhou and has a population of around 250,000.
