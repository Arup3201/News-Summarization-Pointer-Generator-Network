As it turns out, Paula Abdul doesn't have much to be thankful on the eve of Thanksgiving...in regards to her show, X Factor, that is.

The 49-year-old former choreographer's entire category has been wiped out after tonight's shocking double elimination.

Her one remaining group, Lakoda Rayne, was given the boot alongside Nicole Scherzinger's contestant LeRoy Bell.

Double elimination: Lakoda Rayne have been eliminated from the competition

Bye bye Leroy: The youngest-looking 60-year-old on the planet was also sent home during tonight's elimination

Not a happy camper: Paula Abdul's entire category was eliminated with Lakoda Rayne tonight

The ladies - Paige Elizabeth, 18, 
Hayley Orrantia, 17, Cari Fletcher, 17, and Dani Knights, 22 - sang Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me last night but received the overall lowest amount of votes.

Simon Cowell's act, 14-year-old Drew, was also pulled up alongside the girls but was quickly sent to safety.

They appeared to have channelled Swift's graciousness as well, as they gracefully accepted defeat, saying: 'The dream is not over. You'll be seeing Lakoda Rayne in concert everywhere.'

Paula, though furious to be out of the running, will remain on the show as a judge and commentator though she is not personally invested in its outcome.

The second elimination came after a sing-off between the second and third lowest vote-getters: Bell and Marcus Canty.

The Maryland native, who dedicated last night's performance of Boyz II Men's A Song For Mama to his mother, wowed the crowd by singing Christina Aguilera's You Lost Me.

60-year-old Bell also dedicated his song, Sarah McLachlan's Angel, to his mother but failed to impress the judges with his version of The Beatles' Don't Let Me Down.

The X Factor: Canty apparently has it, Bell did not as America decided who to keep around

Like a prayer: The former Pussycat Doll seems to be praying that Bell won't be eliminated

The ride is over: Nicole Scherzinger says goodbye to her contestant, Bell

The 20-year-old's mentor, L.A. Reid, staunchly stood by his contestant, saying: 'If we're talking about a massive star, we're talking about Marcus Canty.'

Bell's own mentor, former Pussycat Doll Scherzinger, defended her contestant, saying: 'I know right now you're singing for your life. I have to send home Marcus.'

Given that she had nothing to lose, Abdul also chose to send Canty packing. She told the young singer that he was one of her 'favourites' but that LeRoy 'really sang for his life'.

Still kicking: Simon's whole group, including Drew, Melanie Amaro and Rachel Crow, are still competing

Safe! L.A. Reid's group of Chris Rene, Marcus Canty and Astro are moving on again in the competition

With his vote as the deciding factor in a tie for Canty and Bell, Simon Cowell opted for the older contestant, bringing the vote to a deadlock.

In a 'Deadlock', America's votes determine the winner - and America determined that Bell should go home.

Like Lakoda Rayne, the Tacoma, Washington native bowed out with his head held high.

Stronger: Former American Idol champ Kelly Clarkson sang her new single, Stronger

Soulful singer: Bruno Mars performed his new single from the Twilight soundtrack, It Will Rain

'I'm actually feeling OK,' the teary-eyed singer claimed, before his mentor butt in to steal the show, as always.

The 33-year-old singer grabbed Bell's mic and yelled: 'He did amazing! Let's hear it for LeRoy!'

In between the glaring double elimination, viewers were treated to performances from Kelly Clarkson and Bruno Mars.

The former American Idol champion sang her latest single, Stronger, in front of gigantic cartoon fists.

Singing circus: The remaining nine contestants performed a medley of Pink songs

26-year-old Mars sang his latest hit, It Will Rain, off the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 soundtrack.

Before the final elimination, all nine contestants performed a medley of Pink songs while dressed as circus performers.

The remaining contestants now stand at seven - Canty, Drew, Melanie Amaro, Rachel Crow, Josh Krajcik, Astro and Chris Rene.

Cowell and Reid's entire categories remain intact.

The judges table: Paula's category is done, but Nicole, Simon and L.A. are still around
