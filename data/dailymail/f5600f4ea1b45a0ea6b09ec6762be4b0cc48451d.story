CCTV footage at the Costcutter store in Essex captured the would-be thief who was wearing the Rod Stewart style mask

A shop worker was left terrified after a man wearing a Rod Stewart mask pulled a gun out on her during a daylight robbery – but ended up leaving empty handed after botching the raid.

Trina Arthur, 31, was working alone in the Costcutter store when the man walked in wearing a mask in likeness to the famous blonde rocker.

The mother-of-two, who was cashing up behind the counter when she felt someone lean over and ruffle her hair, looked up to find the man pointing a handgun at her.

He then attempted to lean over the counter and grab cash from the till but was spooked when Miss Arthur screamed and hit the panic button. 

The would-be thief ended up fleeing empty handed and police believe he may have run off towards a nearby alleyway in Maldon, Essex.

A police helicopter, armed officers and dog units were scrambled to the scene in a bid to find the masked man following the incident on March 27.

Miss Arthur, who has worked at the Costcutter store for three years, said: ‘I initially thought it was one of the regular customers having a joke when I looked up and saw the Rod Stewart mask.

‘Then I saw he had a gun and I just started screaming.

‘As soon as he saw me hit the panic button, he ran out of the shop.’

The terrifying incident has left the shop worker on edge.

She said: ‘I am petrified now. I have not been able to sleep. I keep seeing him with the gun. It felt like forever until the police arrived - I have never been so scared.

‘It’s not something that you think will ever happen to you.’

The shop’s owner Mustafa Demirci, 34, said: ‘Luckily no-one was hurt and he did not get any money.

‘As soon as Trina called me, I knew it was serious from the tone of her voice but I never expected it to be an armed robbery.’

The store was able to provide police with CCTV of the incident which shows the man in his bizarre mask.

Essex Police said the suspect was around 5ft 8ins tall, of medium build and was wearing a grey and white top and black coat.
