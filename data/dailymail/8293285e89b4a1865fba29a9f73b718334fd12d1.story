Extreme winter weather has been causing problems for millions across the East Coast, but it has also made for some beautiful sights.

Among those beautiful sights is Niagara Falls, which has now frozen over due to temperatures which dropped to 16F on Wednesday.

And it looks like the popular tourist destination may stay frozen, as temperatures are expected to drop even lower come Thursday.

Yet another arctic blast is set to strike the central and eastern United States on Wednesday evening, bringing sub-zero temperatures to many parts.

Them things are going to get even colder. 

In fact, almost the entire East Coast, including parts of Florida, will reach below freezing temperatures on Thursday night.

In New York City, temperatures will stay in the teens all day Thursday and by nightfall will be in the single digits and possibly even below 0, making it the coldest it has gotten in the city during this already brutal winter.

The cold weather will also bring with it high winds, this time some reaching 40 mph in areas.

This as Boston continues to be hit harder than any city in the country, though many seem to have a sense of humor about the situation and have taken to social media to post amusing photos and videos.

Meanwhile, the effects of the winter storm that hit the South on Monday are still being felt by the 330,000 people without power in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.

The storm system left more than a foot of snow in parts of the South, while an accompanying ice storm caused a number of fatal road accidents.

There were three traffic deaths in Tennessee, two in Virginia, one in North Carolina, one in Indiana and one in Kansas - all blamed on the storm, The Weather Channel reported.

All government offices in Washington DC were closed on Tuesday due to the dangerous blend of snow and ice that has made travel increasingly difficult.

Coleman, Kentucky, is believed to have been the worst hit, with 18 inches of snowfall.

Meanwhile, Strawberry Plains, Tennessee, saw a ¾-inch coating of ice, according to NBC. The ice also became a huge problem for Lauren Adamski of Cabot, Arkansas as she and her husband David drove to the hospital Sunday night after her water broke.

Because of the ice on the roads the two did not make it in time, and Adamski gave birth in her truck. In the end, the couple had a healthy baby boy they named Brennan. In New Jersey, one unlucky plow even fell into a sinkhole, becoming almost entirely swallowed up.

In Philadelphia, a medical center is set to be demolished as after a fire broke out the water used to put out the blaze has caused thick ice to form all over the structure.
