There is a convincing argument to suggest that Simon Mignolet isn’t good enough to a Liverpool goalkeeper. If that is the case then logic tells us his understudy Brad Jones isn’t either.

Jones hadn’t played a Barclays Premier League game for more than 18 months prior to Sunday’s game at Old Trafford. Such are Liverpool’s problems at the moment, though, that the Australian was handed perhaps the biggest challenge of his rather modest career.

When Liverpool reflect on what went wrong, they will perhaps not focus too much on their stand-in goalkeeper. He is not the reason they lost. Manager Brendan Rodgers will focus on chances missed by Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli and ask why defenders Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren made basic errors.

David de Gea denies Mario Balotelli in the second half in what was an impressive display from United No 1

Nevertheless, while United goalkeeper David de Gea made three or four crucial saves that helped his own only fleetingly effective team over the line, it is very much the case that Jones offered Liverpool very little, or anything, of the same ilk.

De Gea - United’s player of the season so far – made two good saves – both from Sterling – and one outstanding one from Balotelli. Undoubtedly, United would not have won without them.

The first save stopped his team falling behind and 25 seconds later they were ahead. His stop from Balotelli, meanwhile, came at the start of the second half and prevented Liverpool assembling a comeback that was beginning to look likely.

Jones, on the other hand, was largely helpless, if not quite hopeless.

His very first contribution was to slice a clearance first time up in the air. Given that distribution has been one of Mignolet’s recent problems, this did not bode well. Soon after, he was picking the ball out of his net, having dived the wrong way as Wayne Rooney struck firmly towards goal from the edge of the penalty area.

After that, there was a rash dash from goal at a corner – he got nowhere near the ball – and a routine take from a low Rooney cross before he could do nothing about Juan Mata’s decisive second goal scored from an offside position just before half-time.

De Gea was actually the busier goalkeeper for much of the game and perhaps that didn’t help Jones. Goalkeepers – like to outfield players – like to find a rhythm, especially if they haven’t played for a while, and Jones was unable to do that here.

The save he made from a Rooney shot as United broke early in the second period was comfortable enough but shortly after De Gea’s saved from Balotelli, Jones stumbled in trying to adjust to Lovren’s error and Robin van Persie was able to slide the third goal in to an empty net.

It wasn’t a decisive mistake. It wasn’t even that noticeable at first. But it was indicative of Liverpool’s afternoon. Not good enough. But then we knew that. About Jones and the indeed about the team he represents.
