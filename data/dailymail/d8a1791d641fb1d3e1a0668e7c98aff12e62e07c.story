It’s sad that it had to end like this for the vintage steam roller - but at least the pub is still standing.

The operator of the 10-ton machine was forced to crash into the historic 16th century Bankes Hotel in Corfe Castle, Dorset, to avoid crushing a car that suddenly pulled out in front of him.

The driver operating the 'Lord Kitchener'-plated vehicle hit the side wall of the Grade II listed pub after the car turned onto a downhill road in front of him without warning.

Smoking: Water had to be hosed over the black Fowler D2 steam roller to keep it cool after the crash in Dorset

Vintage model: The steam roller collapsed to the ground after its iron casing sheared off in the collision

Quite a scene: The roller is thought to have been travelling at just 2mph after pulling away from traffic lights

But because the pub is made of robust local Purbeck stone it thankfully suffered hardly any damage.

Instead
the hulking traction engine came off worse, with the roller collapsing 
to the ground after its iron casing sheared off in the collision.

Water
had to be hosed over the black Fowler D2 steam roller to keep it cool 
while it took two hours to recover the machine by a mobile crane.

The steam roller is thought to have been travelling at just 2mph after pulling away from traffic lights.

Witness
Nick Squirrell, 49, spoke to the shocked steam roller operator 
afterwards, who told him he could have killed the car driver had he not 
taken the evasive action.

Mr Squirrell, a conservation adviser 
for Natural England, said: 'I saw the aftermath of the accident and 
spoke to the guy driving the steam roller.

‘He said he was driving down the hill
and somebody pulled out in front of him, probably thinking the steam 
roller was travelling very slowly.

'There
wasn't that much damage to the building, mainly because it is made of 
Purbeck stone, but the front of the steam roller came clean off'

'His
option was to go straight into the back of the car and crush it or 
swerve into the pub. The machine didn't fail and it wasn't driver error.

'Surprisingly
there wasn't that much damage to the building, mainly because it is 
made of Purbeck stone, but the front of the steam roller came clean 
off.’

Sam Hill, manager of the Bankes Hotel
in Corfe Castle, Dorset, said: 'I was in the flat upstairs when I heard
a massive noise. The floorboards physically moved and I initially 
thought a bomb had gone off.

'But then it went very quiet. About 30 
seconds later my phone started ringing and a member of staff told me 
what had happened and that I should come and take a look.

'The steam roller was almost in half 
with damage that must cost thousands, yet there was almost no damage to 
the building apart from a bit of chipping.

'The stuctural engineer has said everything is fine - it's a very strong building which was built in 1549.

Sam Hill, manager of the Bankes Hotel

'What I think happened is the steam roller stopped at the traffic lights nearby and was pulling away, so it can't be going more than 2mph. I think it misjudged the turning and then ploughed into the wall.'

And Nick Field, who took photos of the crash, told MailOnline: 'I heard the steam roller coming down the road, so I took my four-year old daughter out into the street to have a look and take a picture.

'We were standing at the exact point the roller hit the wall and moved out of the way at the last moment when I realised what was happening.'

Customers and staff inside the pub, which had recently reopened after refurbishment, reported feeling the building shake.
