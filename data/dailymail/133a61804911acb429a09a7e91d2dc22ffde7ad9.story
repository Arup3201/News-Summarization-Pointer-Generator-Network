The bizarre event which inspired Alfred Hitchcock's cinematic masterpiece The Birds has finally been explained.

The director was said to have based the 1963 film on a creepy incident in California, where flocks of frenzied, dying birds flew into the windows of homes in Monterey Bay.

Scientists have come up with an answer for the freak of nature - that the birds had been poisoned by toxic plankton.

'I am pretty convinced that the birds were poisoned,' said ocean environmentalist Sibel Bargu of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge to USA Today.

The scientists came up with the theory after studying the stomach contents of marine life from the time of the birds' deaths in 1961. They discovered toxic algae on three-quarters of the plankton the birds ate which damaged nerves - causing seizures, disorientation and finally, death.

The algae were believed to have become poisonous after being infected from leaky septic tanks, installed quickly during the housing boom in the Sixties across California.

At the time, police officer Ed Cunningham had been on patrol when a deluge of dead birds began to land on his squad car at around 2:30 am.

The officer told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in 1961: 'By the time I had stopped the car they were raining down all around me.

'They were big birds and they were 
falling so fast and hard they could have knocked me senseless. I thought
 I had better stay in the car and that's just what I did.'

The horror/thriller classic The Birds tells of a
 wealthy woman (played by actress Tippi Hedren) who follows a potential 
love interest to his home town in Northern California which comes under a
 plague of vicious birds, killing and maiming residents and forcing them to hide inside boarded up homes.

The title came from a short story called
 The Birds written in 1952 by Daphne Du Maurier but Hitchcock was said 
to have requested copies of newspapers in California around the time of 
the real-life bird deaths.

Hitchcock's 49th film was met with critical acclaim, receiving a prestigious debut screening at Cannes and was nominated for an Oscar for special effects.

Alfred Hitchcock developed a dangerous obsession with Tippi Hedren – star of The  Birds – which blighted both their careers.

A new drama, The Girl (starring Sienna Miller, pictured, as Hedren) is currently being filmed and depicts an infatuated Hitchcock, 62, sexually harassing the blonde starlet, 31.

He controlled all aspects of Hedren's life including her diet and off-set wardrobe, even forbidding her to drive with male co-stars.

She finally quit when he made it 
clear that she would never work again unless she 
gave in to his sexual demands.

Tippi’s
 decision to walk away stalled her career because Hitchcock kept her to 
her contract and refused to allow her to work with other directors.

But 
the collapse of the couple’s working relationship also had a 
devastating impact on the director, whose long run of hit, classic 
movies dried up.

Tippi Hedren, a model who was in her first starring film role, won a Golden Globe for best newcomer.

Hundreds of birds (gulls, ravens and crows) were trained for the film, while mechanical birds and animations were employed in other scenes.

The film embodies typical Hitchcock techniques to ramp up the suspense. There is no musical score just an electronic soundtrack of bird cries and flapping wings.

The British director's skilled filming techniques were also employed giving the audience the impression of the camera looming over them or putting viewers on edge by using a distorted perspective. 

Hitchcock had originally wanted Cary Grant and Grace Kelly to play the lead roles in The Birds.

Grant had previously appeared in the celebrated North by Northwest while Kelly was equally successful in Rear Window (1954).

He opted for Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren - who he had spotted by chance in an soda advert.

He tied the actress into an exclusive contract for several years and later became dangerously obsessed with her.

The Birds also contains one of Hitchcock's famed cameos. In this film, he is the man walking dogs out of the pet store at the beginning of the movie.

As with many of Hitchcock's masterpieces, the end of the film is riddled with ambiguity.

The reason for the birds' attack is never revealed - and mysterious forces are alluded to.

The freak bird fall which inspired the Hitchcock horror film has not been the only recorded incident of strange deaths.

Randall Cerveny, a professor of geography at the School of Geographical Sciences & Urban Planning at Arizona State University in Tempe, listed several examples for USA Today.

One of the earliest examples was in Baton Rouge, July 1896, when wild ducks, woodpeckers and catbirds fell from the sky and cluttered the streets. One theory is that a strange windfall drove the birds inland from the Florida coast and a sudden change in temperature killed them en masse.

On September 11, 1948 in New York City, thousands of different kinds of birds were killed when they crashed into the Empire State Building.

An explanation was never worked out as 'there was no fog and weather conditions were good during the night and morning' according to a book written in 1961, Mysterious Fires And Lights.

The Master of Suspense: The Birds (1963) was British director Alfred Hitchcock's 49th film and based on a freak incident when birds fell from the sky in California several years earlier
