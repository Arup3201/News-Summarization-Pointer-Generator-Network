A bungling police worker put out an APB for a Police Constable World after coming across a wad of cash with PC World written on it.

The civilian police worker was sorting through bundles of evidence when she mistakenly read that the officer involved was PC World - when in actual fact it was the scene of the crime, the computer store PC World.

The cash had been seized after a raid at PC World in Stockport earlier this year and had been placed in a police safe ahead of criminal proceedings.

PC World, the computer store, not to be confused with 'Police Constable World'

As the police worker was sorting through evidence, however, she didn’t put two and two together and put out a search for a constable World to contact her about the cash.

It was only when another officer pointed out to her that she had ‘misread’ the paperwork that the bungle was realised. 

A police source, who asked not to be named, said today: 'The staff member has got a lot of stick about this with officers going up to her asking her is she’s seen Dixon of Dock Green or DCI Gene Hunt.

'She’s worked here long enough to take it on the chin though and is in good humour about it.'

According to Police magazine this week the female staff member was ‘very experienced’ and the error was ‘most unlike her’.

The magazine reported: 'A very experience member of support staff based in Stockport was recently checking with a colleague the cash seized.

'While going through paperwork she came across a bundle of cash and the form attached.

'Having skim-read the form she asked: ‘Do we have a PC World on this division? I’ve never heard of him.'

A call was put out to track down the mystery cop, but there was no record of him working in the area.

It was only when a colleague of the red-faced worker pointed out that PC World was the ‘crime scene’ not the officer in charge that the search for PC World was called off.

The magazine added: 'The form was read again and it became apparent that the money had been seized from the retailers PC World.'
