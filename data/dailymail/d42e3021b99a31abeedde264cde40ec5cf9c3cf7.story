Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta apologised for his red card in the clash with title rivals Chelsea - but insists Diego Costa should have followed him down the tunnel. 

The Argentina full back received his marching orders for a second booking following a clash with Costa, who was only shown a yellow card. 

Zabaleta tweeted a picture of the Chelsea striker with his hands around his throat with the message: 'I would like to apologise to everyone for my red card today.

'However after seeing this image I can't believe that Diego Costa remained on the pitch.' 

Zabaleta's sending off came moments before Andre Schurrle gave Chelsea the lead, with Costa involved in the move leading to the goal.

However, Frank Lampard came off the bench to rescue a point for the 10-man champions against his former club.
