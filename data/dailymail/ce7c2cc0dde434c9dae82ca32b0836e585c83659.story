A mother-of-three has credited being obese with saving her life - after routine scans before weight loss surgery revealed a massive cancerous tumour on her left ovary.

Emma France, 45, was 22 stone and a size 26 when she decided to book the bariatric surgery.

She said: 'I’ll always be thankful that I decided to have the operation. If I hadn't, my ovarian cancer would never have been discovered and I wouldn’t be here today.'

Obese: At a size 26 and weighing 22 stone, Emma France decided to undergo weight loss surgery in the Czech Republic

Lucky: But a routine ultrasound before her weight loss surgery revealed a 17cm cancerous tumour on her left ovary

After struggling to control her weight gain for years, Ms France, an accountant from Woking, Surrey, decided to have surgery to lose weight once and for all.

She said: 'I’d always been a big girl. Over the years I’d tried every diet under the sun and would lose weight only to put it all back on again.

'I was stuck in a vicious cycle I just couldn’t break.

'I knew if I had any chance of losing weight I’d have to have surgery. I realised I wouldn’t be eligible to have surgery on the NHS but I couldn’t afford to get it done privately in the UK.

'Luckily I discovered a British company which sends patients abroad for surgery, which was a much cheaper option.'

After seeking advice from her private consultant, Ms France decided to have a gastric wrap, which transforms the stomach into a narrow tube, restricting the amount of food patients can eat.

Shock: Ms France (before her operation) said: 'The consultant told me he had discovered a mass near my ovaries, and I had to go back to the UK and see my GP straight away'

In November 2011 she flew to the Czech Republic to have her surgery, having used all of her £5,500 savings to fund the operation.

She said: 'I had mixed emotions, I was nervous but determined and excited, too.

'In the back of my mind I did wonder if the whole thing was too good to be true. I had phoned the clinic a few times and found it hard to get through, so I was wary, but I went anyway.'

The symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise, especially in the early stages of the disease.

This is because the symptoms are often very similar to those of less serious conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome.

The
 most common symptoms are an increase in abdominal size and persistent 
bloating, persistent pelvic or abdominal pain, and difficulty eating.

Other
 symptoms include back pain, frequent urination, loss of appetite, 
nausea, unexplained weight gain, changes to bowel habits and pain during
 sex.

Some patients also experience abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Before seeing the consultant, Ms France had a series of pre-operation checks, including a routine ultrasound.

She said: 'The consultant told me he had discovered a mass near my ovaries, and I had to go back to the UK and see my GP straight away.

'I was in a state of confusion. I was dozy from the drugs and found it hard to understand exactly what the surgeon was saying because of the language barrier.'

On her arrival back in England, Ms France was referred to a gynecologicalcancer specialist and underwent an ultrasound, MRI and CT scan.

She said: 'The oncologist told me I had a tumour on my left ovary. I was in shock but tried not to fear the worst.

'I just didn’t understand how I could have cancer when I had no symptoms at all. I didn’t feel ill.'

On December 15th 2011, she underwent a two-hour operation during which a 17cm cancerous tumour was removed, and she had a hysterectomy.

Ms France, who has children aged 21, 20 and 14, said: 'Luckily the cancer hadn’t spread. I was told I didn’t need to have chemotherapy, just regular checkups for five years.

'I thanked my lucky stars the cancer had been discovered early. I told friends that my tummy had saved my life.'

After recovering from an infection, Ms France decided that she still wanted to go ahead with the weight loss surgery.

On April 24th 2012 she flew back to the Czech Republic for the procedure.

Relief: After successful surgery to remove the tumour, Ms France later underwent gastric bypass surgery and has since lost 7 stone

She said: 'The operation went to plan. I had to have liquids for two weeks before introducing tiny portions of mushy food into my diet.'

Ms France also changed her diet drastically. Having habitually snacked on crisps, chocolate and cakes, she swapped to porridge for breakfast, soup for lunch and meat and vegetables for dinner.

By January 2013 she had lost seven stone. Today she weighs 15st 7lb and can fit into size 16 clothes.

She said: 'I've felt better than I have in years. I have more energy and I’m able to wear the kind of clothes I’d always dreamed of. I feel like a different person.

'I used to dress in black and try and cover myself up, but now I have a wardrobe full of coloured, fitted dresses, which I wear with pride.

'I’m so grateful my cancer was caught early. I now intend to live life to the full.'
