Fluctuating: Mother-of-four posh Spice is well known for her boob job and subsequent removal

When it comes to breast implants, more and more British women say that bigger is better - and are instructing surgeons to increase their bust by four of more cup sizes in a single operation.

The number of females opting for such ‘super boob jobs’ has doubled in the past three years.

According to the latest figures collated by a leading implant manufacturer, ten per cent of Britons  are now asking for the four-cup boost. In 2010, the figure was just five per cent.

But surgeons sometimes face a hard task 
trying to meet the demands of women – not only do they want bigger 
breasts, they also want them to look natural rather than opting for the 
‘bolt-on’ implants favoured by model Jordan.

Miles Berry, a cosmetic surgeon and 
author of The Good Boob Bible, said: ‘Women come in clutching pictures 
of celebrities such as Victoria Beckham and say they want a similar 
look. They are emphatic that they don’t want to look like Jordan or 
Pamela Anderson. Victoria epitomises the more subtle have-I haven’t-I 
look.’

He added: ‘Women want 
bigger, more pert breasts, but they don’t necessarily want people to 
know they’ve had something done. The majority of my patients are 
slightly older women who have had babies.’

The British figures are in contrast to those from Asia. In Hong Kong and Japan 80 per cent of women paid for a one cup-size increase.

Venezuelan women have the biggest desire for the pneumatic look – 20 per cent of them go for an increase of four cup sizes.

Breast augmentation is the most commonly performed cosmetic surgery in the UK, with 9,854 procedures carried out in last year alone.

Demand has continued unabated despite the recent PIP scandal, in which the sale of faulty implants caused a global health scare.

The data was collated by implant manufacturer Global Consolidated Aesthetics from 800,000 operations carried out worldwide.’
