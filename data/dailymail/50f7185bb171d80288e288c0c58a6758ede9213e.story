Thousands of wild badgers could be shot in the coming weeks after the first culling licence was granted yesterday.

The Government will allow farmers to start controlling them on 300 farms in West Gloucestershire over the next four years to prevent the spread of tuberculosis.

The animals are blamed for spreading the disease to livestock, devastating cattle herds, and costing dairy farmers and the taxpayer millions of pounds a year.

Badger culls in England are to go ahead in a bid to tackle tuberculosis in cattle

However, the decision angered animal charities which prefer a vaccination programme for badgers or cattle.

But Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: ‘We would all love to have a vaccine but we haven’t got one.’

Controlling TB in cattle has cost the
taxpayer £500million in the past decade, and costs could spiral to 
£1billion over the next ten years without action, according to the 
Department for Rural Affairs.

A start date for the cull has not 
been set. It must run for six weeks before next February 1 but is likely
to begin sooner rather than later while the weather is warmer.

The cull is intended to tackle the scourge of tuberculosis, which saw 26,000 cattle slaughtered last year
