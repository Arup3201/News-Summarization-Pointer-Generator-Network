They say imitation is the best form of flattery.

Following in the tradition of Spain’s annual La Tomatina festival, thousands flocked to Brooklyn Saturday to toss tomatoes at each other in the sweltering heat.

A food fight for the ages, everyone in the massive crowd was covered from head to toe in tomato.

Holy Tomato!: 5,00 people attended the hour-long tomato bash in Brooklyn

An estimated 5,000 people attended the hour-long tomato toss, according to reports. Some wore goggles, other rode on the on shoulders, but no one left Brooklyn's Aviator Sports and Event Center at Floyd Bennett Field clean.

It didn’t take long for the ground to turn into a sea of warm tomato juice on the almost-100 degree day.

What a mess: 5,000 people tossed 100,000 tomatoes at each other in only one hour

Pow!: The tomato thrower was nailed in the head by a thrown tomato

Revelers paid $50 each for the privilege of covering each other in crushed tomatoes, plus $10 for a shuttle from a local subway station. Over 100,000 tomatoes were used, but organizers said they were all overripe and would otherwise have been thrown away, according to reports.

La Tomatina, Spain’s tomato festival held every August in the small town of Buñol, was the inspiration for Saturday’s sea of red. It normally sees tens of thousands of revelers pitching tomatoes at each other.

There was only one rule for the day, all tomatoes had to be crushed prior to being thrown.
