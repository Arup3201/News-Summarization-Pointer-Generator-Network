Tragic: Dylan Cecil was playing on a slipway when he lost his footing

The grieving mother of a four-year-old boy who was swept out to sea has hit out at internet trolls who set up a Facebook page containing fake messages from her son.

Dylan Cecil’s body has still not been found since he fell from a slipway into treacherous waters during a family visit to the seaside.

His parents, Darren Cecil and Rachel McCollum, both jumped in to the sea after their son fell but could not save him, and have since been keeping a vigil on the beach at Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset.

A page on the social networking site called ‘RIP Dylan Cecil’ contains a message from a user masquerading as Dylan that reads: ‘To my mum, my daddy and sisters and seaside grandparents I love you all. Am in heaven waiting on you all.’

It continues: ‘I’ll be looking down on you :-) x Sent from the rainbow and flowers and sunshine in heaven...X.’

Miss McCollum, 27, who had previously used her own Facebook account to say her ‘heart, soul and life [have been] ripped apart’, later responded to the false messages.

She wrote: ‘How low can people be? I tried saving my son and a page [is] set up speaking like they are him.

‘I’m distraught he is still missing at sea, I ain’t slept at all and to find someone pretending to be my son has destroyed me even more.’

Other internet users expressed their disgust at the Facebook group, with one responding: ‘I’m reporting this page – you are disrespectful trolls.’

Another added: ‘Take this page down, you insensitive ghoulish t**** – he is not your child to mourn and debate, the parents have enough anguish already.’

Before he was swept out to sea, Dylan 
and his sisters, Faith, three, and one-year-old Alice, had been staying 
with their grandparents, while Miss McCollum and Mr Cecil, 30, took a 
short break in Dorset.

The couple returned from their break on Sunday 
and took their children to the shore that evening, when Dylan fell off 
the slipway into the water, in an area which is notorious for its low 
visibility and powerful currents.

Miss McCollum said yesterday: ‘I can’t get closure. He is still lost. What can I do? I did all I could.

‘He was playing on the end of the jetty and he was less than a metre away from me and he slipped.

‘He lost his footing. He went under. I jumped in straight away, as did his dad, but we both got pulled by a whirlpool.

‘He went straight away. He never came back. I got dragged myself. I knew. I knew he was gone.’

Anger: Dylan's devastated mother Rachel McCollum immediately made her feelings known once the fake profile emerged

Looking out to sea, she added: ‘He was beautiful. He was absolutely beautiful. I couldn’t ask for a better kid.

‘He was polite, well-mannered, 
gorgeous. I don’t want him lost at sea. He needs to be with me.’ Placing
 an arm around her shoulder, her father told her: ‘He will come back.’

But she replied: ‘He won’t  come back.’

Yesterday a witness told how she 
helped pull Mr Cecil and Miss McCollum out of the water after they had 
frantically tried to save their son.

Claire Holbrook, 28, a nurse who had 
been visiting the beach with her seven-year-old daughter Leah, said: ‘I 
heard a scream [and] noticed two adults, who had walked past us earlier,
 in the water.

Outpouring of sympathy: Dozens of wellwishers have left candles and flowers at the scene where Dylan was last spotted on Sunday evening

Helpless: As more passers-by laid flowers at the scene, Dylan's desperate mother said her four-year-old son 'needs to be with me'.

‘The woman was yelling, “Help me, my little boy is dead” and the dad claimed he was stuck.

‘A group of people rushed to help the mum, and another man and myself helped the dad.

‘By that time he was nearly gone 
himself – he was just so exhausted – so we dragged him out and put him 
in the recovery position. It wasn’t until about ten minutes later that 
we realised that there was also a little boy in the water – there was 
just no sign of him.’

She continued: ‘[The] mum was frantic. She was just absolutely inconsolable – but they fought until the end.

‘I think deep down we all knew he was 
dead straight away because he never came back up. It was like he had 
gone somewhere.’

Miss McCollum has also placed a small Winnie the Pooh 
teddy bear among the numerous flowers in place on the sea wall, close to
 where a huge heart with Dylan’s name written in the middle has been 
carved into the sand.

An onlooker said: ‘She said that her 
daughter went up to her last night with the teddy and said that it was 
now called Dylan.

'She looked absolutely exhausted. She put a well-loved 
Winnie the Pooh teddy on the wall and told a police officer that it was 
her kids’ favourite show.’

An official search to find Dylan – 
involving the RAF, RNLI, coastguard and local hovercraft crews - was 
called off on Monday afternoon, but volunteers continued to scour the 
water yesterday.

A Facebook spokesperson today said the fake profile has been removed, as it violates the site's rules.

The
 spokesperson said: 'Impersonating others is against our terms, and we 
encourage people to report such activity to Facebook via the reporting 
links located on every page of the site.'
