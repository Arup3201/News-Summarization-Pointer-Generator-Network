Desperate singles are always told to play it cool to snag a date - but it's a different story for the lucky in love.

According to a new Recovery.org study, men are more likely to hit on women online who are actively looking to cheat on their partner.

And the more brazen the cheating profile the better, with affair-seekers reportedly turned on by the prospect of readily available 'fresh, immoral meat'.

Study: Research shows OkCupid users in the five most unfaithful U.S. cities were more likely to message 'brazen cheaters'

Honey trap: The self-confessed 'brazen cheaters' attracted the most interest on OkCupid

For this experiment, 40 fake profiles (20 men, 20 women) were created on dating website OkCupid, using photos of real people, identifying themselves in one of four categories:  'brazen cheaters', 'married maybes', 'recently taken' and 'sincerely single'.

The fake daters stated they lived in the most adulterous U.S. cities, as identified by married dating 
site Ashley Madison - Oklahoma City, Miami, 
Houston, Austin, Texas, and Washington D.C.Â 

Recovery.org is a site for people 
struggling with drug and alcohol addiction.

The study, called 'To Catch A Cheater', found the female brazen cheats were the most popular group, receiving 998 messages in a month compared to 890 for single women, 355 for married maybes and 284 for the recently taken.

While the men received drastically less messages than the women overall, the male brazen cheats also received more messages than any other group.

And the brazen profiles were incredibly brazen.

'My profile lists me as single but I'm not going to lie to you, I AM in a relationship right now. I'm here because I want to meet someone new but I don't want my current partner to know about it,' one fake user wrote.

The responses were mixed:

'You are the most striking woman I have laid eyes on in years. Let me know if I can fill any holes in your relationship for you,' one potential cheater wrote.

'We are in the same boat lol,' another claimed.

However of the 44 messages the male cheaters received, 36 were insults or inquiries into whether their adulterous ways were really true.

Messages ranged from 'I presume this is a joke. If not then wow' to 'Do you have any idea how unattractive your profile is?'
