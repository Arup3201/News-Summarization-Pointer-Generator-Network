President Obama suffered a fresh blow with figures revealing that the economy grew by just 1.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2012

President Obama has suffered a fresh setback as new figures reveal that the economy grew by just 1.3 per cent in the second quarter of the year.

The growth rate for the period from April to June has been was lowered from a previous estimate of 1.7 per cent,  the Commerce Department said today.

Mr Obama will take some solace from the latest benefit claims statistics which show the number of people who filed first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments fell by 26,000 last week.

Overall, however, it is the disappointing growth rate which will be the President's major concern.

The severe drought that reduced farm production in the Midwest is thought to account for half the downward revision to the growth rate with the estimate for crop production being slashed by $12 billion.

But slower growth in consumer spending and exports has also weakened the overall growth rate.

Economists said the Midwest drought would be likely to hold back growth in the July-September quarter.

But Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics, said once the drought eases and crop yields rebound to normal levels, the farm sector will provide a boost to economic growth.

The new figure shows that growth slowed from 2 percent rate in January-March and isn't expected to exceed that level for the rest of the year.

In addition to a fall in the number of first time unemployment insurance claimants, the number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits fell by 4,000 to 3.27 million in the week ended September 15, Labourr Department figures revealed today.

A turnaround in claims rates, which have 
been on the rise since July, suggests that U.S. businesses may be 
growing more confident that sales will pick up.

But at the same time, the jobless rate may
 be slow to fall after exceeding 8 percent for 43 months without a 
pick-up in the pace of hiring.

Growth at or below 2 percent is typically
 too slow to lower unemployment, which was 8.1 percent in August and 
most economists expect it to remain at that level for the 
rest of this year.

'The labour market is not getting any 
worse,” said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro 
Research LLC.

'But jobless claims only tell you one side of the 
equation, so they don’t automatically mean that hiring is going up.'

A weak economy and high unemployment could hurt President Barack Obama's re-election chances and bolster Republican nominee Mitt Romney's campaign.

High unemployment and sluggish growth prompted the Federal Reserve last week to announce several major steps to boost the economy.

Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed 
will buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a month until there 
is 'substantial' improvement in the job market.

A
 separate report from the Commerce Department today showed demand for 
capital goods rose in August while failing to make up for declines in 
the previous two months, signaling slowdowns in business investment and 
exports threaten to further restrain the U.S. economic recovery.

Orders
 for non-defence capital equipment excluding airplanes rose 1.1 percent 
after decreases of 5.2 percent in July and 2.7 percent in June. Total 
orders for durable goods, those meant to last at least three years, 
plunged 13 percent, the most since January 2009, paced by a plunge 
decline in demand for civilian aircraft.
