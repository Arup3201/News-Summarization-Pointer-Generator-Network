He was one of Scotland's most famous explorers and a national hero.

And to mark the 200th anniversary of Dr Livingstone's birth, an exhibition has opened today to commemorate his life and legacy and will run until April next year.

Among the objects going on display at the National Museum of Scotland are the hats reputedly worn by David Livingstone and journalist Henry Morton Stanley when they met in Africa in 1871, leading to the famous line: 'Dr Livingstone, I presume?'.

The collection houses around 100 artefacts, documents and artworks - brought together for the first time - and charts Livingstone's life story from humble beginnings working in a cotton mill to becoming a missionary in Africa and building strong links between Scotland and Malawi.

Some of the objects on display at the museum were collected by Livingstone himself such as a weaving loom and artefacts from Africa.

Others are on loan from the David Livingstone Centre, the Royal Geographical Society, Glasgow Museums, the National Library of Scotland and private individuals.

The cross on show was made from the wood of the tree under which Livingstone's heart was buried, after he died from dysentery and malaria in 1873, in what is today Zambia.

The chief of the village where he passed away agreed to having the explorer's body returned to Britain but insisted that his 'heart belonged to Africa' - and it was duly cut out and interred at what is now the site of the Livingstone Memorial.

Also on show are the tools of Livingstone’s trade, both as a missionary and an explorer. 

The collars and chains he removed from African slaves are testament to his vehement opposition to slavery.

Livingstone was born to a working-class family in Blantyre, south of Glasgow in 1813.

Livingstone was attacked by a lion (drawing

and married Mary Moffat (pictured right with their children in

Aged ten, he started working in a 
cotton mill - and was schooled in the evenings by the mill company which
owned the building in which the Livingstones lived.

In 1836, he studied medicine and theology in Glasgow, and set his heart on becoming a missionary doctor.

Posted to the Kalahari desert in 1841, he would go on to explore much of central and southern Africa - becoming the first European to see, and name, the Victoria Falls.

After returning to Britain in 1864, he left for Africa once again two years later to find the source of the Nile - during which nothing was heard of him for several months.

It was then that Henry Stanley sensed a scoop, and was commissioned by the New York Herald to find him.

Born Rowlands in Denbigh, Wales in 1841, Stanley moved to America aged 18.

While there, he found a rich benefactor, from whom he took his surname.

He finally found Livingstone, who had been missing for five years, in 1871, in what is today Tanzania - and is then said to have uttered the famous line, which gives the exhibition its name.

Livingstone died in what is now Zambia, in 1873, suffering from malaria and dysentery.

Stanley wrote a bestselling account of his adventure, then became an MP and was knighted in 1899. He died in 1904.

Sarah Worden, curator of African 
collections at National Museums Scotland, said: ‘Through Doctor 
Livingstone, I Presume? we’re delighted to bring a new focus to the man,
the myth and his legacy.

‘This
exhibition brings together exciting new research, National Museums’ 
spectacular African collections, and Livingstone’s personal possessions 
to recount some of the epic exploration and achievements which led to 
his rise to celebrity in Victorian Britain.’

National Museums Scotland is working 
with National Museums of Malawi, and with the support of the Scottish 
Government, to create a Livingstone display in Blantyre, Malawi next 
year.

The exhibition in 
Edinburgh, which runs until April 7, is accompanied by a programme of 
events and talks, and the publication David Livingstone: Man, Myth and 
Legacy.

The famous meeting of Stanley and Livingstone in Africa, 1871

It has gone down in history as one of the most memorable greetings of all time.

'Doctor Livingstone, I presume', said Henry Stanley after months of searching the African bush for the long-lost explorer.

Stanley made great capital out of his remark on 19th-century lecture tours, and it helped to make him a major celebrity.

But he probably never said it at all, according to biographer Tim Jeal.

In his 2007 book, Stanley: The Impossible Life of Africa's Greatest Exploree, Jeal says Stanley invented the phrase to help define his image as the archetypal reserved, stiff-upper-lipped English explorer.

'Stanley told lies, that is the problem,' said Jeal. 'And a liar can never subsequently tell the truth.'

The son of a Welsh prostitute, Stanley re-invented himself several times, becoming first a newspaper correspondent in America, then an adventurer and explorer of the African continent before finally becoming a politician.

It was while working for the New York Herald that he was asked to find the Scottish missionary explorer David Livingstone, who had been missing for five years.

Stanley succeeded in locating him in 1871, in what is today Tanzania, to land one of the greatest scoops of the century.

But his diary does not mention the greeting. It refers only to 'a pale-looking white man in a faded blue cap'. More tellingly, the next two pages have been ripped from the book.

Jeal asked: 'Why else did he tear up those pages?'

The author insisted he was not out to rubbish the reputation of Stanley and maintained he was a great man. 'He was our greatest land explorer and I can say that as I am Livingstone's biographer too,' he added.

Jeal revealed that Stanley had always been impressed by the tight-lipped Englishness of army officers, and he particularly loved an anecdote about two English gentlemen who had passed each other in the wilds of Palestine and merely lifted their caps to each other.

As a result he invented the famous phrase about his meeting with Livingstone, having asked himself the question: 'What would a gent have said?'

The phrase first appeared in the New York Herald in 1872, and Stanley subsequently repeated it many times.

A handwritten manuscript of a lecture was sold at Christie's in 1999 and gave a standard version of events: 'Doubtful of the temper he would receive me,' wrote Stanley, 'I simply bowed and said, "Dr Livingstone, I presume?"

'He held out his hand in token of kindly welcome and in a few minutes we became warm friends.'
