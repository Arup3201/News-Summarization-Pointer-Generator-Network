The Prince of Wales has recorded a spoof video mocking the well-known meltdown by a television presenter during a royal interview in 1977.

Ian 'Molly' Meldrum famously stumbled over his words when he was joined by Prince Charles in the studio for popular Australian music show Countdown almost 40 years ago.

In the interview, the journalist and record producer exclaimed: 'Your Royal Highness...oh, oh, I'm sweating like a pig' and became more anxious as the interview went on - swearing at his own slip-ups.
