Despite some experts claiming it can’t be done, the race is on to build a robot with the same kind of consciousness as the human brain. 

Google, Apple and IBM are just some of the tech giants developing systems designed to be more autonomous and intelligent than what’s come before.

But according to one analyst, there is a clear leader; a firm that will reach the pivotal milestone before anyone else - and that's Google. 

An analyst believes Google is in the best position to create the first ever conscious machine and already has related projects in the place. It recently bought a number of robotics firm, such as Meka pictured, for example. The analyst claims conscious machines could be developed within the next 20 years

Machine consciousness differs from machine intelligence.

There
 are already intelligent machines that can learn from their mistakes and
 fix errors, but many of these are programmed to do so.

For example, world chess Grandmaster, Gary Kasparov, was defeated by IBM’s ‘Deep Blue’ supercomputer in 1997.

Another IBM-developed computer, called
 Watson, won the TV game show, Jeopardy, in 2011 by answering general 
knowledge questions posed in natural language. It has more recently been
 used as a customer call centre agent.

Apple Siri, Google Photo Search and Google’s 
self-driving cars are further examples of machines that exhibit 
behaviour similar to that exhibited by intelligent humans.

To become conscious, Sheehy said systems would need to be able to look at the rules the humans had programmed, to identify 
inconsistencies or gaps and report back.

Alternatively, they would be able to discover errors in algorithms and consciously fix them without being asked.

‘We can already see evidence of machine learning and machine intelligence in existing Google products like Google Now, the search function that forms part of Google+ Photos and Google’s self-driving car project,’ explained Andrew Sheehy from Generator Research.

‘A string of recent acquisitions in the field of robotics and machine intelligence, along with the recent hiring of Ray Kurzweil as a director of engineering shows that Google is by no means done with machine learning: it is clear that the company is just getting started.

‘Taking into account the present scale of Google’s computer network, the size of its user base and its capital reserves, Google is well placed to take on something as ambitious as machine consciousness.’

Apple Siri, Google Photo Search and Google’s self-driving cars are further examples of machines that exhibit behaviour similar to that exhibited by intelligent humans.

Google Now, in particular, uses predictive analysis to make educated guesses about what phone owners need - from traffic information, diary appointments and weather reports.

The comments were made by Andrew Sheehy, pictured, who is chief analyst at Generator Research

‘If we define an intelligent machine as something that exhibits useful behaviour that is understandable, predictable and controllable, then a conscious machine is not just intelligent but it can autonomously adapt and optimise within its own environment,’ continued Sheehy.

‘IBM’s Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov using a ’brute force’ approach, which involved running through millions of possible outcomes for each move. Deep Blue’s ‘intelligence’ arose from its ability to apply a set of human-defined rules.

Within this narrow sphere, Deep Blue exhibited signs of intelligence, but it was not conscious.’

inconsistencies or gaps, and report back.

Intel, IBM and Qualcomm are each already working on neuromorphic computing, which uses new physical structures to replicate others.

The Geneva-based Human Brain Project, meanwhile, has attracted €1.5 billion of EU money to deliver an electronic-software model of the human brain in 10 years.

Although several years behind Europe’s Human Brain Project, the U.S. government has also committed initial funding to the BRAIN initiative, which is working to ‘revolutionize our understanding of the human brain’.

Earlier this month, researchers from Stanford University created the Neurogrid, pictured - a computer chip based on the human brain that is 9,000 times faster than current computers. The $40,000 (£23,600) circuit board mimics the brain on the power it takes to run a tablet computer

In 2011 IBM's Watson computer competed against Jeopardy's two most successful contestants, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. During the practice match Watson was given the same questions as the other contestants and could virtually press the buzzer to answer. In the majority of cases Watson beat both contestants

Last week, a mathematician announced robots will never have feelings and never develop consciousness.

This is because a mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness proves it is impossible to build an emotional machine.

Professor Phil Maguire, from the National University of Ireland in Maynooth, said computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling.

This is because the mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last decade by Professor Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, states the ability to integrate information is a key feature of consciousness.

‘Many people, including highly respected people in the tech world – like Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, believe that we will never be able to create a conscious machine,’ added Sheehy.

‘I used to think that way, too, but I no longer do.

'Instead, I now believe that the question is not whether artificial machine consciousness will arrive, but when it will arrive and what form it will take.’

Even ‘partially conscious’ machines, according to Sheehy, would transform the world when combined with their ability to process vast amounts of information almost in real time.

He added that although the thinking behind machine consciousness can create issues with the belief of humankind and spirituality, he sees it as ‘just another phase in the evolution of the human species.’

The consensus among supporters on when machine consciousness will be achieved is between 10 and 20 years.

‘While that is a long time, it should be remembered that this is shorter than the age of the mobile communications industry and, certainly at 10 years, is close enough for this technology to have an effect on the valuations of companies, including Google,’ continued Sheehy.

The stage on from machine consciousness, is machine self awareness.

Andrew Sheehy from Generator Research said: 'We can already see evidence of machine learning and machine intelligence in Google's self-driving car project,' pictured. He added few companies have such a track record in investing in visionary technologies as Google

Sheehy added: 'A string of recent acquisitions in the field of robotics and machine intelligence, along with the recent hiring of Ray Kurzweil as a director of engineering shows that Google is by no means done with machine learning: it is clear that the company is just getting started.' Kurzweil is pictured

Sheehy defines a self-aware machine as one that is ‘intelligent, conscious and can also take autonomous action to increase its own intelligence or consciousness.'

‘If there ever was a Holy Grail in tech, then it would have to be machine consciousness.

‘Google’s development path strongly indicates that this company will be the first to find the Grail and see what’s inside – at which point everything changes.’

'Whoever reaches consciousness first will be able to race ahead of the competition: the victor will be able use their conscious machine to accelerate its own rate of progress.

'The further ahead the leader gets, the faster he is able to run. Eventually, competitors are left so far behind that they cannot catch up.'
