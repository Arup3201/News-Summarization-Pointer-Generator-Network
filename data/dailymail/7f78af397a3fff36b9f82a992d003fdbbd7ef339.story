Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola has refuted reports suggesting he could return to Barcelona if Joan Laporta is re-elected as president of the La Liga giants.

Luis Enrique's position at the Nou Camp is said to be up in the air due to apparent unrest among the players - including Lionel Messi - at the club.

However Guardiola has ruled out a move back to his former side by stating he does not think he is the 'solution' for Barcelona.

The Spaniard, speaking at Bayern's winter training camp in Doha, told Mundo Deportivo: 'Laporta hasn't said [he is going to appoint me]. You've read it somewhere but he's not said it.

'There are a lot of options and the right people will make the right decisions to keep Barca up there among the best clubs in the world.'

Barcelona will be hoping to follow up their comfortable 5-0 Copa del Rey win against Elche on Thursday with a victory against La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid.

Spanish publication Sport have urged Barcelona fans to forget about 'internal conflicts' during Sunday night's match at the Nou Camp.

Both Barcelona and Atletico Madrid are currently four points behind leaders Real Madrid.
