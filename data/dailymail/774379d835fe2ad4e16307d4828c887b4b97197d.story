If you haven't started your Christmas travels yet, you likely know someone who already has.

This week marks the start of the holidays, with many children starting their school breaks and joining their families across the globe.  

As many as 116,700 passengers are expected to depart from London's Heathrow airport on Friday December 19, with 698,438 expected to fly out over the following five days.

Holiday travel is in full swing as of Dec 19, when 116,700 passengers are expected to depart from Heathrow

During this time, 65 per cent of all Heathrow passengers will be travelling to visit family and friends, which is nearly double the rest of the year.  

And outside of London, over five million travellers will take to the skies in the next seven days to spend the festive season with their loved ones.

To celebrate this incredible mass travel schedule, Heathrow has created an animation to show the movement of people from the UK across the world in the week leading up to Christmas Day - including a special journey from Santa himself on Christmas Eve.

Over the next week 43,405 flights will depart and arrive from UK airports with 22 per cent of these flights departing from Heathrow and mainly to long haul destinations.

Normand Boivin, Chief Operating Officer at Heathrow said, 'Heathrow is proud to help take passengers further on their journey around the world for the festive season. 

'This is such a busy and exciting time at the airport and the visualisation captures the service we provide for the world.

'As an added treat, on Christmas day we will also be offering festive flyers specially created boiled sweets in three flavours – turkey, sage and onion stuffing and Christmas pudding – so travellers don't miss out on their dinner at 30,000 feet.'
