Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola has refuted reports suggesting he could replace Manuel Pellegrini at the helm of Manchester City.

The former Barcelona boss has been linked with a move away from the Allianz Arena as talks over a new contract have been put on hold until the summer.

Guardiola, whose current deal at the Bundesliga giants is due to expire in 2016, has revealed he wants to remain at Bayern Munich for a 'long time'.

Guardiola has ruled out the possibility of replacing Manuel Pellegrini at the Etihad Stadium 

The 44-year-old, speaking in a press conference, said: 'Manchester City? I hope to stay at Bayern Munich for a long time.

'I have a contract with this wonderful club and aim to fulfil that. I have not received any offers.

'We will see what happens after next year. I am very happy at Bayern.'

Current Manchester City boss Pellegrini has dismissed claims suggesting he has to win a trophy  if he is to remain in charge of the Barclays Premier League champions.

Manchester City manager Pellegrini does not believe he is under pressure to win a trophy this season 

Pellegrini said ahead of Manchester City's league encounter against Leicester City: 'I am not under any pressure to win an amount of titles or win a title every year.

'I don't feel any pressure.

'I only feel pressure when I don't see my team playing the right way.

'All the other things are not important.

'When I signed my contract nobody told me about winning five titles in five years. That was what [chief executive] Ferran Soriano said [to the media]. But that doesn't have to be one a year.'
