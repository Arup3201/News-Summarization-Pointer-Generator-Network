Two brothers have died within less than a year of each other, leaving their parents devastated. 

David Butler, a serving soldier, died on November 24 last year following a two-year battle with cancer.

His younger brother Rob was found dead earlier this month - just days before his 28th birthday and weeks before the brothers' parents Mel, 68, a retired engineer and Anne, 60, prepared to mark the first anniversary of David's death at their home in Sittingbourne in Kent.

David Butler died in his early 30s and had spent 14 years with the Royal Signals, completing two tours of Afghanistan. He had also recently married.

Henry Durban-Haskins a friend of the family said: 'Rob coped as best as he could when Dave died. They were very close and he found it very tough.

'When Rob died there were no signs, no warnings. Rob was unbelievably fit - he was well-known for it.

'And then there's the timing - almost a year on from Dave passing away - as the family were thinking about that.

'They had had an enormous amount to cope with over the last year. 

'So this happening at this time is just tragic. The odds are unbelievable. We're struggling to get our heads around it all. 

Rob Butler was found dead by his girlfriend just days before he was due to celebrate his 28th birthday

Rob Butler had been travelling with friend Henry Durban-Haskins along the Pacific Coast Highway in America

'Rob will be dearly missed by me and by so many people. I'm just thankful for all the great memories.'

Rob Butler was found dead in bed by his girlfriend on November 2. He died of unknown causes.

The younger of the two brothers was in the middle of studying for a masters in physics the University of Kent, and was also a barman.

Mr Butler was studying for a masters in Physics at the University of Kent before he died on November 2

Several years ago Rob had won an apprenticeship with BAE Systems, the research and engineering giant.

Mr Durban-Haskins added: 'He decided on studying a degree in physics – something he could use in his career. 

“He worked hard and was a gifted student. The degree led on to a masters degree. He was specialising in optical lenses.

“His father had been an engineer, so it maybe ran in the family.”
