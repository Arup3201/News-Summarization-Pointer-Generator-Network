It was one of the original lads' mags famed for its coverage of music and sport - and its shots of scantily-clad women.

But the publishers of Loaded  have announced the magazine is closing down after 21 years - and its April edition will be the last.

At its height, the title – set up in 1994 – was one of the leading players in the booming sector, commanding a six-figure readership.

But the most recent edition, which came out on March 26 - featuring Noel Gallagher and novelist Irvine Welsh - is to be its last, bosses have revealed.

Deputy editor Lia Nicholls revealed the closure on Twitter in a post which included pictures of the first and last editions of the magazine.

She said: ‘The very first and unfortunately the last issue of @loadedmag. Sad day. Loved every minute.’

At times during its 21 year life, Loaded ran into controversy attracting criticism over the number of scantily-clad women it included in each edition.

Circulation fell as it went through a number of different ownership changes, but after a relaunch last year, Loaded said it would be ‘far more discerning and sophisticated’ in its depiction of women, the BBC reports.

The Telegraph reports that circulation topped 500,000 for its 50th edition in June 1998.

Lads' mags may have taken off in the mid-1990s, but some of the many titles that became synonymous with the booming sector had already been around for some time.

The likes of FHM and Arena had been catering for the male market since the middle of the 1980s and more emerged in the following decade. 

But although many titles prospered in that era and continue to do so, circulation for some of the best-known magazines started to suffer with the rise of the internet.

Men's monthly magazine Arena was set up in 1986 with the aim of providing a mix of fashion and style.

But circulation declined in its last decade and it was closed down by publishers Bauer in 2009.

In the same year, it was announced that the UK print edition of Maxim would be closed after 14 years having been launched in 1995 by Dennis Publishing. It was reported at the time that the US version would be sold on British news stands. 

In 2004, two new weekly titles, Nuts and its rival Zoo, were launched within weeks of each other leaving more established lads' mags reeling - but they often encountered controversy for their portrayal of women.

Although many titles prospered in the 1990s and continue to do so, circulation for many of the best-known magazines started to suffer with the rise of the internet

Front pages predominantly featured pictures of scantily clad women and in 2013 it was reported that Co-op would no longer sell Nuts. It came after the title rejected an ultimatum to use 'modesty bags' or be removed from shelves, it was reported at the time. 

Despite having a weekly circulation of more than 300,000 at its height, the circulation of Nuts was in decline by 2007 and in 2014, IPC Media announced that it was closing the title down.

Zoo, published by Bauer Media Group, is still operating as it another well known lads' mag title from the era, FHM, which started in 1985 as For Him Magazine, 

But sales plummeted to about 35,000 in 2011, the last officially audited figures for the magazine.

It was one of a number of lads’ magazines that became popular in the 1990s along with the likes of FHM and Maxim and, later, Nuts and Zoo.

The magazine’s publisher Simian said in a statement: ‘As of the current April issue, published on March 26th, Loaded will cease to trade as a printed magazine.

‘We would like to pay tribute to our customers, staff and especially our contributors and editorial team.’

One of its initial 1994 launch editors, James Brown, told his Twitter followers that the closure was 'a pity' adding: 'The last team seemed to have made a real go of it.'
