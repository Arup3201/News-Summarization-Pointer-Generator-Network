Steve Bruce claims players diving threatens the honesty of the Premier League that makes it admired across the world.

The Hull manager said he was not convinced by calls to introduce a panel to review diving incidents, as has been suggested by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, but said action does need to be taken.

Chelsea have been at the centre of renewed controversy over diving this week and, during their match against Hull on December 13, Diego Costa and Willian were both booked for supposedly taking a tumble, while Bruce compared a Gary Cahill dive to 'something out of Swan Lake'.

Bruce said: 'It's very difficult for referees when you have people like [Eden] Hazard and Willian, who are genuinely quick and take you on with a low centre of gravity - the slightest tap can take them over.

'But when you see a blatant dive, I think you have to take action. The reason why the Barclays Premier League is the league that it is, is for its honesty, its integrity and ferocity.

'You must remember that people enjoy the honesty of the Premier League all over the world. We can't make it like every other league - it's a different culture.

'I'm not so sure about a panel, but we have to start taking action against it.'
