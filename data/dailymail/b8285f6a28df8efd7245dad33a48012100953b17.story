Stopped: The Duke of York was ordered to 'verify his identity' by armed police officers in Buckingham Palace gardens

Scotland Yard today came out in support of armed police who challenged the Duke of York in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.

They stopped Prince Andrew less than 48 hours after a break-in at the historic house and asked him to 'verify his identity'.

It is the second time the Duke has had a run-in with police under similar circumstances. He has also been denied entry to Sandringham after he failed to show his official pass, which all royals are expected to carry with them.

A source told the Evening Standard that the officers were 'doing what they are supposed to do', particularly so soon after a break-in.

Former royal protection officer Ken Wharfe told the paper: 'I think this was a straightforward challenge at a time when there were probably extra patrols deployed. I do not think that guns would have been drawn.

'I could see Prince Charles having a joke about it, but Prince Andrew may have lost his rag a bit.'

Prince Andrew reacted with fury at the two gun-wielding officers who confronted him as he walked in broad daylight through the grounds, sources revealed last night.

The fifth-in-line to the throne stood his ground asking the officers 'Don't you know who I am?' and was said to have ‘made his thoughts plain’ during the highly-charged confrontation that followed.

A royal source said: ‘He was incredibly, incredibly angry. It was very much a case of guns being pointed at him and “halt who goes there”.’

Yesterday police issued a humiliating apology to the Duke of York over the extraordinary error.

According to the Daily Mirror, a source said that the Duke was red faced as he shouted at officers like a school teacher.

Incident: Prince Andrew had gone for a walk around the gardens in Buckingham Palace when the two officers stopped him

They said: 'It got pretty heated because he just kept repeating himself "Don't you know who I am?".

'He felt the officers had sneaked up on him and believed they had behaved disrespectfully towards him.'

They added that when the penny dropped they apologised to Prince Andrew. But this was not enough.

The
 source added: 'He gave them a proper dressing down, shouting at them 
like a schoolteacher before he walked back to the main house - 
completely livid.'

It was 
the second police fiasco within three days at what should be one of the 
most secure estates in Britain. Just 48 hours earlier officers 
discovered a mentally ill man attempting to smash down a door with a  
fire extinguisher after he scaled a 12ft wall and broke in.

Yesterday
 Scotland Yard revealed senior officers had personally apologised to  
Prince Andrew in a bid to draw a line under the latest matter.

In
 an unprecedented statement, a spokesman said: ‘We are grateful to the 
Duke for his understanding and have apologised for any inconvenience 
caused.’

Scotland Yard
 declined to comment on reports that the officers shouted at the 
53-year-old royal, telling him to ‘put your hands up’ and ‘get on the 
ground’.

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh attend church yesterday. They were accompanied by Prince Charles

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were in Aberdeenshire for the 
Braemar Gathering where they attended a church service yesterday morning

A source said it 
would not be ‘uncommon’ for police to shout when challenging someone, 
but added that they did not know if he was ordered to lie down.

In return, Prince Andrew issued a 
conciliatory statement, saying: ‘The police have a difficult job to do 
balancing security for the royal family and deterring intruders, and 
sometimes they get it wrong.’

But
 hinting at his anger over the confrontation, he added: ‘I am grateful 
for their apology and look forward to a safe walk in the garden in the 
future.’ 

Break in: Victor Miller was arrested inside the palace

Royal sources
 said Andrew had been ‘infuriated’ by the fiasco. They continued to 
insist that weapons had been drawn by police, who were in a state of 
high tension following the previous security breach.

One source said: ‘[Andrew] has calmed down now but it wasn’t a pleasant experience at all, and he was furious at the time.’

Another
 palace aide told the Mail: ‘The police have acknowledged the incident 
and apologised and he is happy to move on. He knows they have a 
difficult job to do and is supportive of them.’

However,
 senior palace sources also made clear that the prince had not been 
willing to make a public statement until he had received a full apology 
from the Met.

The prince had just 
returned from a two-week holiday in Spain with his former wife Sarah, 
the Duchess of York, and their daughters Beatrice, 25, and Eugenie, 23.

The
 pair of uniformed marksmen challenged him after discovering him near a 
perimeter wall in a relatively isolated area of the palace garden.

Royal
 staff are said to be incredulous that those involved failed to 
recognise the prince, although officially police chiefs are saying they 
did nothing wrong.

One 
source said: ‘Once it was clear who Andrew was, he certainly made his 
thoughts plain about what had happened.

'It has been the subject of a lot
 of conversation, especially as Andrew is not exactly known for 
suffering fools gladly.’

His former protection officer Ken Wharfe describes him as rude, bossy and terse.

At
 the time of the incident, the Met’s Royal protection unit was on high 
alert after Victor Miller, 37, was caught inside the ornate State Rooms 
on Monday night.

The complex can be accessed only through an inner 
courtyard at the heart of the palace.

The
 DJ and sound engineer – who claims to have worked with stars including 
Amy Winehouse, N-Dubz and Tinchy Stryder – is being held in a secure 
mental health unit after being arrested and questioned on suspicion of 
burglary, trespass and criminal damage.

A suspected accomplice, a man aged 38, was found outside the palace and arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary.

No royals were present when the break-in took place but experts are incredulous that Miller got so far before being stopped.

The
 two incidents highlight the tension between police and the royal family
 over security.

The Queen – who is currently staying at Balmoral Castle 
with Prince Philip – has made it clear she wants the palace to be 
accessible to the public as possible.

Former
 Scotland Yard Commissioner Lord Blair played down the Prince Andrew 
confrontation as he said it was impossible to make any site completely 
secure.

‘They will have to look at this,’ he added. ‘The story of the 
burglar is a much more difficult story than the Andrew story.’

Last
 night, former royal protection chief Dai Davies said of the Prince 
Andrew incident: ‘[The officers] were alert and that was good, but 
saying that, they should know who His Royal Highness is.

‘It
 is a very big garden and we don’t know where he was and who he told, 
but you would expect officers to be aware if he had gone out.

'Why wasn’t
 anybody aware that he was having a walk about?

‘They
 are right to challenge anybody they don’t know, quite obviously if they
 don’t and something happens … they are criticised.’

A
 Metropolitan Police spokesman declined to comment on whether the 
officers would face any disciplinary action or ‘words of advice’.

He 
said: ‘Uniformed officers approached a man in the gardens of Buckingham 
Palace to verify his identity. The man was satisfactorily identified.

‘No
 weapons were drawn and no force  was used.

'We can confirm that the man 
 spoken to by officers was the Duke of York. We are making this public 
with His Royal Highness’s permission.
