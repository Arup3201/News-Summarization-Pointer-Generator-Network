An Army soldier confessed that he killed his pregnant wife by persuading her to wear handcuffs during sex and then suffocating her with a plastic bag over her head, according to the testimony of his former Army buddy heard during his court martial.

Prosecutors at Fort Stewart on Monday used testimony alleging the confession to open their case against 22-year-old Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, who is charged with murder as well as killing an unborn child.

He faces an automatic life sentence if a military judge convicts him of murder in the July 17, 2011, death of Sgt. Deirdre Aguigui.

Capt. Janae Lapir, an Army prosecutor, said in her opening statement that Isaac Aguigui wanted to be free from a rocky marriage and coveted the $500,000 in life insurance and benefit payments he received from the Army after his wife was found dead in their apartment on the southeast Georgia Army post.

She called him 'a schemer' who tricked his wife into letting him handcuff her.

'Sgt. Aguigui never had a chance to fight back because she never saw it coming,' Lapir said.

Civilian prosecutors say Aguigui used the insurance money to buy guns and bomb components for an anti-government militia group, F.E.A.R. (short for Forever Enduring Always Ready), which he started by recruiting other disgruntled soldiers.

F.E.A.R members had stockpiled assault weapons and bomb components and discussed plotting attacks on a crowded landmark in nearby Savannah, poisoning the apple crop in Washington State and even assassinating President Barack Obama.

Aguigui is already facing the death penalty in the state of Georgia after he was charged with ordering the cold-blooded murder of soldier Michael Roark, 19, and his girlfriend Tiffany York, 17, in December 2011 - eight months after he allegedly killed his wife.

The young couple were found shot in the head near Fort Stewart.

Aguigui pleaded guilty in a civilian 
court last summer to murder charges in the slayings, saying he feared the soldier would turn on F.E.A.R.

Investigators also  three other soldiers â€” Sgt. Anthony Peden, Pvt. 
Christopher Salmon and Pfc. Michael Burnett â€” and charged them in the deaths.

Salmon and Peden, who prosecutors say fired the killing shots, are still awaiting trial.

Friends of the Army couple testified Wednesday about constant fighting in their marriage over Aguigui's drug use and infidelities by both husband and wife.

Deirdre Aguigui, 24, was about seven-months-pregnant when she died, and friends said her husband had questioned whether the child was his.

Testimony in pretrial hearings showed the Army was delayed in bringing charges because the military's autopsy failed to identify a cause of death for Deirdre Aguigui.

Last year, a Georgia state medical examiner reviewed the case and gave a second opinion, saying she must have been choked or suffocated because every other potential cause could be ruled out.

He noted marks on her wrists indicated she struggled violently as her hands were cuffed behind her back.

'She had kicked him out of the house 
for reasons of infidelity and drug use,' said Chief Warrant Officer 
Justin Kapinus, an Army criminal investigator, said of the pair last 
year. 'It was very evident they had a rough marriage.'

Aguigui
 called 911 on the evening of July 17, 2011, saying he found his wife 
unconscious and unresponsive on the couch, with chunks of a potato she'd
 eaten for dinner in her mouth, Kapinus said.

Kapinus
 testified in a preliminary hearing that initial results of an autopsy 
on Deirdre Aguigui were inconclusive. A second look by a medical examiner for the Georgia Bureau 
of Investigation concluded someone killed the woman by choking her or 
otherwise blocking her airway, Kapinus said.

When
 she died, Deirdre Aguigui had small cuts and abrasions on her wrists 
and investigators found a pair of handcuffs on the bed, Kapinus said.

The bed was also covered with sex toys, leg restraints and other 
paraphernalia. The investigator said Isaac Aguigui told investigators he
 and his wife had used the handcuffs and other items during sex a few 
hours earlier. Kapinus said he suspects the bedroom scene was staged.

He
 said, 'It seemed excessive.'

Aguigui's friend Michael Schaefer testified that Aguigui at first told him his wife died from a blood clot.

About a month later, after they had been up all night using cocaine, they got into an argument.

Schaefer said he asked his friend point-blank what really happened to his wife.

'He told me he had strangled her with a bag,' Schaefer said. 'He handcuffed her, put a bag over her head and strangled her' while also sexually assaulting her.

Capt. Scott Noto, one of Aguigui's defense attorneys, noted that Schaefer never mentioned a confession during several previous interviews with Army investigators or when he testified at a pre-trial hearing for Aguigui last summer.

Schaefer said he was afraid to speak up until Army prosecutors granted him immunity from prosecution in Deirdre Aguigui's death.

Investigators said the young couple had been separated until not long before Mrs Guigui, a promising Army linguist, died.

'She had kicked him out of the house for reasons of infidelity and drug use,' said Chief Warrant Officer Justin Kapinus, an Army criminal investigator.

'It was very evident they had a rough marriage.'

Charged: Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, pictured at his preliminary hearing on August 30, 2012, was accused by prosecutors in 2011 of plotting attacks as leader of an anti-government militia group

Aguigui called 911 on the evening of July 17, 2011, saying he found his wife unconscious and unresponsive on the couch, with chunks of a potato she'd eaten for dinner in her mouth, Kapinus said.

The investigator said about eight hours before Aguigui's wife died, he had sent a text message from his cellphone to an old girlfriend that said: 'We'll have plenty of money.'

Lieutenant Colonel Kristin Brown, an Army obstetrician who treated Aguigui's wife during her pregnancy, testified that she had complained that her husband had been unfaithful and that they planned to get a divorce.

Investigators also learned that Deirdre Aguigui had sought confidential counseling for domestic abuse.
