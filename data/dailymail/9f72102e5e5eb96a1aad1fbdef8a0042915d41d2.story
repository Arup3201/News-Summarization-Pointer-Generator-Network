A boxing commentator and radio host has been suspended from his job with ESPN-LA Radio following a conversation he had on-air.

Max Kellerman was on the Mason and Ireland show which leads into his afternoon drive program when the subject of Ray Rice's domestic abuse of his wife arose.

Kellerman admitted on-air that he hit his girlfriend many years ago.

The New York Daily News reports that ESPN suspended Kellerman following the 'inappropriate' comment.

ESPN issued a statement Friday afternoon neither confirming nor denying that Kellerman had been suspended.

'Max Kellerman will return to ESPN-LA Radio and SportsNation on Thursday,' it read.

The startling admission occurred as Kellerman related a story about his then-girlfriend, now wife Erin Kellerman.

According the the Daily News, he said that the pair were at a college party and both had too much to drink.

The situation escalated and his girlfriend hit him. He hit her back, he said, but the incident was a one-off and they have been happily married for 20 years.

While Kellerman's admission of having hit a woman was upsetting, the reason for his suspension is for discussing Ray Rice's domestic abuse, which is extremely controversial after Stephen A. Smith's recent debacle.

Kellerman's suspension comes three days after Smith was suspended for comments he made while discussing the same case.

Smith condemned domestic violence but advised women not to 'provoke' men to it.

'Let's make sure we don’t do anything to provoke wrong actions,' he said, presumably to his female viewers.

'...I think that just talking about what guys shouldn’t do, we got to also make sure that you can do your part to do whatever you can do to make, to try to make sure it doesn’t happen.'

He later issued a taped apology calling his comments the most 'egregious error' of his career.
