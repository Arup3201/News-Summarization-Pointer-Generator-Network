Police have released chilling images of an armed robber threatening a betting shop employee with a hammer before fleeing with cash.

The man, who was dressed in a pinstripe suit jacket, raided the Ladbrokes bookmakers in Boscombe in Bournemouth, Dorset, at 6.24pm on Wednesday.

He threatened a male member of staff with a hammer and demanded money, which was handed to him.

The man, who was wearing a white shirt, suit jacket and jeans and carrying a laptop bag, then left the betting shop.

Detective Inspector Mark Samuel, of Dorset Police, said no one was injured during the incident.

'We were able to obtain very high quality CCTV images very quickly in relation to this incident,' Mr Samuel said.

CCTV showed the man threatening a member of staff with a hammer before making off with money

'I am hoping that somebody will be able to recognise the suspect from these photographs. I would ask anyone who recognises him to contact Dorset Police urgently.

'I am keen to speak with anyone who has any information about the incident or may have seen the man in the area of Christchurch Road.'

The man is described as white, in his mid-thirties, about 5ft 9ins tall with short black hair.
