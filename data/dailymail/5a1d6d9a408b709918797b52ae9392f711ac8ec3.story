Two burglars responsible for targeting more than 30 homes in South Wales - including that of Swansea City's head coach - are today behind bars for a total of 10 years.

Ben Llewellyn, 28, and James Green, 34, were caught in the act, raiding a woman's home in Alltwen, near Swansea.

Detectives then matched imprints of their footwear taken at the scene, to forensic evidence gathered at the home of Garry Monk, former Swansea City defender and the club's interim manager, in the aftermath of a break-in.

Appearing at Swansea Crown Court, Llewellyn and Green were sentenced for a string of more than 30 house burglaries across the city and in neighbouring Neath.

After their arrests the pair confessed to committing more the spree of crimes dating back to 2002.

Llewellyn, from Morriston, was jailed for six years at the court on Friday, while Green, also from Morriston, received a four-year prison sentence.

Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Constable Chris Grey, of Swansea CID, said: 'From an early stage of our investigation into the burglary in Alltwen it became apparent that Green and Llewellyn were involved in burglaries across the whole Swansea and Neath Port Talbot area.

Garry Monk's home was one of more than 30 targeted by Llewellyn and Green since 2002

'We have utilised every investigative 
tool available to us to link them to unsolved burglaries - some of which
 date back over a decade.

'We have contacted all the victims of these crimes to inform them and in some cases we have been able to return substantial amounts of stolen property to them.'

After the pair were arrested, officers executed search warrants in Swansea and Neath, Port Talbot, where they seized stolen property.

Two women were arrested and later pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods.

Donna Williams, 33, from Bonymaen, admitted handling items taken from the burglary of Mr Monk's house, namely a £3,500 Chanel watch, which she bought for £20.

Samantha Davies, 38, from Port Talbot, admitted handling stolen goods and will be sentenced at Swansea Crown Court on March 10.

Police discovered a photograph of her wearing a watch belonging to Mr Monk's partner.

Detective Chief Inspector Jane Mackay added: 'Getting burgled is an upsetting experience and we always pursue every line of enquiry to trace those responsible and return stolen property to victims.

'We currently have one of the highest detection rates for house burglaries in the country and we are determined to maintain our record and continue to deliver the best quality of service to victims of crime.'
