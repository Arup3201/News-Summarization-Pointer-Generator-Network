A woman has become the first person to be charged under a new 'revenge porn law' after posting a naked picture of her ex-boyfriend's new partner online. 

Rachel Lynn Craig, 28, is facing charges under 'the unlawful dissemination or sale of images of another' legislation, which was established in July in Virginia.

Craig, from Augusta County, allegedly took a picture of the 22-year-old woman off her ex's phone and posted the naked image on Facebook.

Accused: Rachel Lynn Craig, 28, is facing charges under 'the unlawful dissemination or sale of images of another' legislation, punishable by up to a year in prison

The woman whose naked picture was put online was informed by people who saw it. 

Craig admitted to stealing the picture, Waynesboro Police Department reported.

To charge an individual under the act, police must prove 'the intent to cause substantial emotional distress'.

Waynesboro sergeant Brian Edwards told NBC29: 'What was the intent of Ms. Craig for posting this? She considered the victim a romantic rival for this one individual's affections and she said that she did it out of anger.'

MailOnline was awaiting a response from the Waynesboro Police Department today.

Craig, who works for a home healthcare company, is facing up to one year in jail and a $2,500 fine after being charged on Saturday and released.

The 28-year-old, who is believed to have three young children, is a prolific social media user. In one selfie image, she wrote alongside: 'Your either on my side, by my side or in my f******* way choose wisely.'

The woman also posted last month: 'I wish u could fall outta love with someone as fast as u fell in love with them...' 

Virginia joins Utah, Alaska, Idaho, Texas, California and New Jersey in banning revenge porn. Maryland and Wisconsin are considering making the practice illegal.
