The first twin giant panda cubs to be born in the United States and survive have been given names that come from a Chinese idiom meaning 'something indescribably beautiful and magnificent', zoo officials in Atlanta said on Wednesday.

The names - Mei Lun (may loon) and Mei Huan (may hwaan) - were announced when the male cubs reached 100 days old, in keeping with ancient Chinese tradition.

More than 51,000 people voted on ABC television's Good Morning America website to choose from five sets of names suggested for the pair by staff at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in China, Zoo Atlanta officials said.

The panda cubs, born in July at Zoo Atlanta, will not be on public view until late fall

'We're delighted to finally be able 
to place names with two youngsters who have not only made an indelible 
mark on the history of Zoo Atlanta, but who have also made history in 
the U.S.,' said Zoo Atlanta President and Chief Executive Raymond King.

The panda cubs, born in July at Zoo 
Atlanta, will not be on public view until late fall. Until then they can
be seen live via a webcam on the zoo's website, said zoo spokeswoman 
Keisha Hines.

The cubs were the fourth and fifth 
babies born to mother Lun Lun and male Yang Yang, both 15. All five cubs
were the product of artificial insemination, according to zoo 
officials.

Giant pandas are an endangered 
species that only live in the wild in a few mountain ranges in central 
China. An estimated 1,600 live in the wild and about 300 in captivity, 
mostly in China, zoo officials said.

The twin boy cubs were a shock to 
staff at Atlanta Zoo when they arrived. The zoo was expecting just one 
new arrival based on a recent ultrasound, but were thrilled when 
15-year-old mother Lun Lun delivered twins.

The cubs were the first giant pandas to be born in the United States in 2013.

Surprise! 15-year-old Lun Lun was to be a mom for the fourth time, but ended up birthing a set of twins Monday to the surprise and joy of Zoo Atlanta staff 

Atlanta Zoo is one of just four in 
the U.S. which has pandas on loan from China. Zoos must be able to 
demonstrate that they will carry out research to help the species 
survive in the wild and in captivity and getting their hands on a panda 
is highly competitive among zoos.

Fulton County Zoo's panda programme began in 1999, according to the Washington Times.

Visitors flock to see the unusual creatures, especially when new arrivals go on display.

Zoo officials are working with animal
care workers from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, 
where Lun Lun and her 15-year-old partner, Yang Yang, were born.

When the two arrived, Raymond B. 
King, Zoo Atlanta's president and CEO, said: ‘This is a success we share
with all of our fellow zoological organizations working to understand 
and protect this iconic species, and we share our joy with our local 
community and with our colleagues in China.'

‘Twins are an entirely new scenario 
for Lun Lun, Zoo Atlanta and our animal care teams, who will no doubt be
extremely busy over the next few months,’ his statement added.

Lun Lun had been artificially 
inseminated in March and has been under 24-hour observation by a camera 
providing a live video feed from her den. Zookeepers weren't immediately
sure of the genders of the cubs.
