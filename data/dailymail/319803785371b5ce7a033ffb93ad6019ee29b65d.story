The woman whose massive personal closet supposedly full of luxury goods was robbed earlier this month has admitted some of her personal items are in fact 'costume.'

The Houston Press reported that it received goods from the supposed thief that broke into Theresa Roemer's 'she-cave' August 2.

That individual used a New York City-based disposable phone - and a voice modulator - to call the weekly August 12, The Houston Press said. 

'I contacted Theresa Roemer and explained
 to her that her items were fake,' the person reportedly told The Press. 'I
 requested over half a million dollars to return her items and not 
expose her to the news. During the meet, it seemed as if she contacted 
authorities. The deal never went through. I'm following through with my 
threat.'

In response, Roemer told ABC13 'He claims that whatever it is that's in there is fake. Well, you know, if you walk into any one woman's closet there's gonna be valuable things, and there's gonna be costume things, and there's gonna be vintage things.'

Homeowner: Theresa Roemer has revealed that some of the items inside her massive 'she cave' closet are not as expensive as others. The person who reportedly robbed Roemer earlier this month has said the items in her closet are fake

Ransom plot: The bracelet and watch were among some 10-15 valuables stolen earlier this month from the home of Theresa Roemer

Personal memento: The loot included this silver heart-shaped locket with a lock of light-brown hair inside that supposedly belonged to Roemer's deceased son

Shakedown: The burglar allegedly asked Roemer to pay up $500,000 to stop him or her from revealing to the media that her valuables were worthless, but the former Miss Texas refused

'It's one thing to be robbed but now it's
 another for someone to hold me for ransom for my belongings,' she also 
told the affiliate station.

Roemer also defended herself to ABC13, saying 'If this crook really knew me and did the research on me, he would know I'm as authentic as they come. What you see is what you get.'

Houston Press reporter Craig Malisow told The Houston Chronicle that speaking to the mysterious individual 'was kind of odd.'

'It sounded like he felt like he was wronged - because when he went to go fence this stuff, he was allegedly told this was fake ... it kind of felt like he was the victim here,' Masilow told the newspaper.

Masilow, speaking about a heart-shaped locket sent to The Houston Press that supposedly held the hair of Roemer's dead son, told ABC13 'I think that hair would be the key to finding out whether or not it's fake.'

Reporter: Craig Masilow of The Houston Press says he was contacted by an individual who claimed to have robbed Roemer's 'she cave'

Police have released security camera footage showing the thief who robbed former Mrs. Texas United America of nearly $1 million in jewelry, bags, and valuables from her luxurious 'she cave'

Surveillance footage recorded a small man dressed entirely in white and wearing gloves in the house, taking four trips to move all the goods outside

On Saturday, Roemer told HoustonCultureMap her closet contained both expensive and inexpensive goods.

'It's like any person's closet. You mix and match,' she told the website.

'In my closet, I have a Donna Karan dress next to one from the Gap. My stylist had some vintage jewelry there from back in the '60s. Not everything is a million-dollar design.'

Montgomery County Sheriff's Office investigators have retrieved the items sent to The Houston Press.

'As soon as we got the news [about The 
Houston Press], we made contact to get up there and we're trying to 
identify whoever sent these items in,' Lt. Brady Fitzgerald told The 
Houston Chronicle.

Roemer said she used the space to host charity events and that it took her a whole 45 minutes to get ready

Citing an infrared camera, Roemer told The Houston Chronicle 'That's why it is so unclear and we can't tell the exact color of [the thief's] clothing.'

Roemer told the newspaper she and her husband failed to turn on their home's security system the night of the robbery.

'I don't think anybody can go through life without doing something careless when they're flustered and hurried before leaving,' she told The Houston Chronicle.

'But now I lock all my doors and have lights on, inside and out. The alarm is set, and I'm having more lights and cameras installed.'

Roemer said that because she was only away from her home a short while she did not arm the security system

Roemer said she and her husband were only away for 90 minutes to eat dinner at a nearby country club

The luxurious 'she cave'  cost
 roughly $500,000 to build, The Houston Chronicle reported in July.

'It
 started years ago when I had a closet party and all the girls came over
 and they said, "I just wish it was bigger,"' she told the newspaper at the time. 'Since then it's just been getting bigger and bigger and bigger, it's like a ''she cave.''

'The
 third floor houses all my furs and big hats, you come down the spiral 
staircase to the second floor which is where I get my hair and make up 
done, it also houses all the shoes from Louis Vuitton and Gucci, to my tennis and work out gear,' she said.

'Then

 you come down a floating staircase, which is just magical, and the 
first floor is where you pick out your jewelry and bags,' she continued.

'My daughter always says that she doesn’t need to go to the store; she can just shop my closet!' she once told Neiman Marcus's blog. 'And of course I do let a few, very special friends borrow my Birkin bags.'

It appears the thief gained entrance by using a glass cutter to get into the bathroom
