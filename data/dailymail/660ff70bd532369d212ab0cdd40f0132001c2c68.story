Warning: Customers on 02 have been told not to talk about private matters on mobiles after a systems glitch

Mobile phone customers are being warned not to discuss private or financial matters during a call after a systems glitch means that strangers can listen in. 

Dozens of 02 customers are being connected to strangers’ calls in error, raising concerns about security.

The phone giant’s users can not be heard but can listen into a conversation.

Customers began reporting the 'crossed lines,' which also affects people being called on other networks by O2 users, on Monday.

Users have also reported being switched from the call they were on to an unknown person in mid-conversation.

The network provider said the glitch has hit customers in the Birmingham area, reported The Sun.

Disgruntled users took to the internet voicing their annoyance on Twitter and forums.

Jeni Cantle tweeted: 'I was on the phone to my partner on Monday when I was added to a completely different conversation.'

the past few days. Both times I was mid conversation when the voice 
changed from my husband's to that of a womans. Could cause all sorts of 
trouble! You could tell it was a crossed line as it sounded distant but 
really bad news for o2.'

the conversation, and the person i am calling can hear the same 
conversation, but they cannot hear me.'

'This morning I attempted to make a call and instead of a dial tone I 
found myself listening to what sounded like one half of a very private 
conversation in Russian. What on earth is going on O2?'

MoneySavingExpert.com creator Martin Lewis said: 'While on the surface this may seem a minor inconvenience, there is a risk of having your private or financial information overheard and suffering a loss on the back of it.

'Until O2 sorts itself out, the sensible precaution would be to think carefully what you say if you're speaking to someone via the O2 mobile phone network.

'If I were to boil this down, don't be too afraid to use the phone but best to avoid banking and bonking conversations.'

Reports of similar problems on O2 go back to 2010, pointing to a long-term problem that flares up at intervals.

An 02 spokesperson said: 'We had a problem with a network card responsible for transferring call traffic in the Birmingham area which resulted in a handful of customers experiencing crossed lines during phone conversations. 

'Our engineers identified that a cable linked to the card was not working correctly and fixed the problem at 6.15pm on Tuesday. We have been monitoring the situation closely with no further reported issues. We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers.

In July, hundreds of thousands of 02 customers could not use their phone for 24 hours after a glitch.
