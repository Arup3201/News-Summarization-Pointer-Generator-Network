A bizarre Russian Roulette-style game in which players take turns drawing cards from a deck of cards featuring exploding kittens, weaponized enchiladas and back hair has received almost $2million in funding.

The game, a brainchild of Matthew Inman, the creator of the cult comic Oatmeal, gathered the funding via its Kickstarter page within only a few hours after being launched.

Originally called Bomb Squad, it wasn't until Mr Inman became involved that the game truly found its quirky appeal.

The Exploding Kittens card game has proved hugely popular, with players claiming its Russian Roulette-style suspense is extremely addictive

As the creators' explain: 'Exploding Kittens is a highly strategic kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game.

'The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.

'So if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.'

The Kickstarter, launched with the modest goal of attracting $10,000, surpassed even its creators' wildest expectations when it hit $1,734,000.

Created by Mr Inman, Elan Lee and Shane Small, the game's appeal lies in its suspense as it edges closer to completion and the chances of drawing an exploding kitten card increase.

Mr Inman told The Washington Post: 'I've wanted to make a card game for a long time, I just don’t know how to make one with great mechanics and replay value, and Elan and Shane created something really fantastic.

'I suggested that we change the name to Exploding Kittens, and add cards like unicorn pigs and Sasquatches and weaponized back-hair and a bunch of other weird Oatmeal-inspired attack cards. 

'From there, our little game was born.'

It's not the first time Mr Inman has created a stir among fans for his outrageous ideas.

In 2012 after being served with papers for a $20,000 lawsuit filed by rival website 'FunnyJunk', he decided to ignore the legal wheels and produce his own response.

After being served with a $20,000 lawsuit in 2012, Exploding Kittens creator Matthew Inman raised the money, photographed himself with it (pictured) and gave it to charity rather than pay the claimaints

He said: 'I'm going to try and raise $20,000 in donations. I'm going to take a photo of the raised money.

'I'm going to mail you that photo, along with this drawing of your mom seducing a Kodiak bear. I'm going to take the money and donate one half to the National Wildlife Federation and the other half to the American Cancer Society.'

He later made good on his claim, posting a selfie of himself next to a stack of $20,000 in cash.

Mr Inman's cartoons have made him extremely popular across the internet, with examples of his work such as '10 Words You Need To stop Misspelling' and 'What It's Like To Own An Apple Product' being shared widely on social media such as Facebook and Twitter.
