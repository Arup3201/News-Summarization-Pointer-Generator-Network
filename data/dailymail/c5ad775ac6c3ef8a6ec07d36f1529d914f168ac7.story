A foreign currency trader accused of masterminding a £5.5m fraud to fund his playboy lifestyle was dubbed 'King Popper' after he sprayed £32,000 worth of champagne at revellers in a nightclub.

Alex Hope, 25, allegedly concocted the £5.5m Ponzi fraud which he used to fund his gambling habit and penchant for spending tens of thousands of pounds on champagne at exclusive nightclubs, Southwark Crown Court heard.

The former catering manager racked up a bill of £2m in just 13 months after visiting the clubs, buying large bottles of champagne and going to an exclusive Mayfair casino.

Prosecutors described Hope's spending - which included splashing out almost £50,000 on a single bottle of champagne on one occasion - as 'eye-watering'. Today jurors were shown a video of his alleged activities.

They said the amount of money he was spending must have represented  part of investors' money who had been persuaded to invest in his scheme after he offered huge returns.

Hope reinvented himself as a currency markets expert and was promoted by Raj Von Badlo as a talented trader and financial whizzkid, it is claimed. Von Badlo has already admitted enticing people into fraud and making misleading statements.

The 25-year-old set himself up as a successful Forex and currency trader, promising investors huge returns on cash funnelled into his scheme. In just 13 months he managed to take £5.5m.

But many of his investors lost considerable sums of money - including Jamaican international footballer Marvin Elliott who lost £50,000. He is accused of running the scheme in a 'Ponzi fashion' - using new investors’ funds to pay off those who wanted to leave it. 

The court heard that on one evening alone he spent £32,000 at the five-star Grange Hotel near St Paul’s Cathedral earning him the title ‘King Popper’.

Prosecutor Sarah Clarke said: ‘According to the receipts he managed to spend about £32,000 in one night in February 2012 at something called the Champagne Spray event. 

‘The was an event that was organised where people could go to this hotel and buy bottles of champagne and, in effect, spray them over each other.’ 

In a video shown to the jury Hope is seen wearing a drenched blue t-shirt and black beads as dozens of bottles of expensive champagne are sprayed around the room by revellers.

And in a further example of excessive spending Hope spent almost £50,000 on a Midas sized bottle of champagne while partying at the Playground Hilton in Liverpool.

‘Mr Hope spent £45,987 in one night, and the lion’s share of that went on this bottle, this Midas sized bottle, of Ace of Spades champagne that was opened effectively as a publicity stunt by him,’ said Ms Clarke.

‘The nightclub PR in fact ran up a bill of something like £200,000 and then it was put out in the press that this high-roller spent £200,000 in one night.

‘The truth was that he only spent a mere £45,000, £40,000 of that going on this bottle of champagne,’ she said.

On another night he spent £65,113 at the Aura nightclub in Mayfair, close to Buckingham Palace and the Ritz.

Hope also funnelled just under £1m to the Palm Beach Casino, whose website brags it is the ‘most exclusive casino in Mayfair’.

Between joining the casino in November 2011 and his arrest in April the following year, he visited the lavish venue 81 times, jurors heard.

Dozens of revellers are shown throughout the video spraying champagne and waving bottles with sparklers 

He lost £353,600 after playing games where more than £5m was passed backwards and forwards over the table, it was said.

‘What that figure does seem to suggest is that he was an extensive and prolific gambler during that period,’ said Ms Clarke. 

‘The amounts of money that were being lost... when he lost you may think he lost big.’ 

But £604,400 simply disappeared from the cash deposited with the casino, probably in cash withdrawals, and has not been traced, the court heard.

‘Were any of the investors told that their money was going to be put into a casino and then withdrawn in cash for it to disappear?’ asked Ms Clarke.

Receipts unearthed at Hope’s address showed just a ‘snapshot’ of his allegedly wild spending.

‘The sums of money being spent is, the prosecution say, eye-watering and must have represented in whole or at least in very substantial part investors’ money and again you might want to ask yourselves if any of the investors were told that is what was happening to their money,’ said Ms Clarke.

Hope also treated himself to luxury trips around the world, travelling to Miami, New York and Dubai, jurors heard.

He spent £130,327 on a stay at beach front resort the Fontainebleu in Miami and racked up bills of £38,838 on night at the Cirque du Soir in Dubai.

Ms Clarke added: ‘The Fontainebleu Miami trip was not the only luxury foreign travel experience that he treated himself to during this period with, we say, the investors’ money. 

‘Bear in mind of course this was really a relatively short period of time as well.

‘We know he was enjoying them because he recorded some short films on his mobile of one particular trip he enjoyed to New York,’ she said.

The video shows Hope in his suite at the five-star Trump SoHo hotel in New York. He pans around the luxurious suite and ends pointing the camera at the bed which is strewn with money and designer clothes.

‘Here is the bedroom,’ he says, ‘just being silly, laying some money out, you can see the 50s and the 100s.

‘Did a little bit of shopping today as you can see, bought some Ralph [Lauren], bought some trainers as well, bought some Burberry... yeah, this is me.’

Other short videos taken from his mobile show him panning stacks of cash, in one he brags ‘£28,000 profit, boys’ and in a second ‘£50,000 profit, boys, ten, 20, 30, 40’ before the video cuts out. 

Nearly £64,000 was spent on ‘upper class’ travel to destinations including Las Vegas and New York, it is said.

And the spending did not stop there, with Hope allegedly using investors’ cash to fund a taste for designer clothes - particularly Christian Louboutin shoes and watches. 

Hope, of Canary Wharf, is on trial for fraud at Southwark Crown Court and has denied the single charge 

Ms Clarke added: ‘This gives you a snapshot of the ways in which he was enjoying himself, treating himself with investors’ money during the period of the fraud.

‘His trading really wasn’t keeping pace with what was coming in from investors and what was going out. As the money from investors was increasing and his expenditure was increasing, in fact the amount of money that was being deposited on trading platforms in the first place was drying up to virtually nil.’

Jurors heard Christopher Millard, a retired teacher, ploughed £25,000 of his own money into Hope’s scheme which saw him lose £15,000.

Hope promised him: ‘I am a man of my word, I have never not paid anyone, let’s get that straight first and foremost.’

Jamaican international footballer Marvin Elliott, 30, was also drawn into the scheme.

Hope is pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court where he is on trial for fraud, which he denies  

The midfielder, who plays for Crawley Town in Football League One, handed £50,000 to Hope after he promised 50 percent returns in just three months, but lost his investment, jurors previously heard.

Ms Clarke said Hope told a ‘pack of lies’ and added his trading was ‘spectacularly unsuccessful’.

Van Badlo, who does not appear in the dock with Hope, acted as the ‘promoter’ for the fund.

He used PR companies to present Hope as a ‘talented and successful trader’, drawing £4,292,000 into the alleged scam.The pair also allegedly blew £3,000 a month of client’s cash on publicity provided by London PR firm Full Portion Media, jurors heard.

Hope set himself up as a successful Forex and currency trader, promising investors huge returns on cash funnelled into his scheme. Through his deception, he took an ‘eye-watering’ £5.5m in just 13 months, between March 2011 and 3 April 2012, jurors heard.

‘The truth was this was not a successful trading scheme, in fact it wasn’t a trading scheme really at all - it was a fraud,’ said Ms Clarke.

‘Mr Hope was not a successful trader, investors funds were in fact paid into his personal bank account and they were used by him as his personal piggy bank,’ said Ms Clarke.

Hope was allegedly using new investors’ funds to pay off those who wanted to leave the scheme, in the classic Ponzi fashion. Hope has admitted violating City rules which state he must have a licence from to work on behalf of others, although he is allowed to trade currency for his own profit.

After suspicions around his Forex fund grew, the Financial Services Authority intervened and arrested him. 

Hope, of Canary Wharf, east London, denies one charge of fraud. He has pleaded guilty to carrying on a regulated activity when not an authorised by the FSA.

Von Badlo, of Buckinghamshire, admitted making misleading statements and communicating an invitation or inducement to encourage investment activity following the collapse of the first trial.

Jurors were told this is a retrial and that jurors at the first trial were discharged before retiring to consider their verdicts. The trial continues.
