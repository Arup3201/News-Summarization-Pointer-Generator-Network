A video allegedly unveiling Subway's deceptive marketing tactics has been mysteriously leaked by an unknown source.

It was uploaded on Tuesday by an anonymous user but was allegedly created by former Melbourne franchisee Arun Singhal as part of a suspected $35 million blackmail plot against the sandwich giant.

Mr Singhal's initial concerns of Subway's business practices allegedly prompted him to create a number of videos and a website to reveal the franchise's trade secrets, called 'The System', reported The Age.

A restrained video allegedly unveiling Subway's deceptive marketing tactics has been mysteriously leaked by an unknown source

The released video may have violated the injunction order obtained by the company in May after Subway made claims about Mr Singhal's intentions, prohibiting certain information from being released. It is unclear whether the leaked video is subject to the court order.

It isn't suggested that the 30-year-old breached the court order. Mr Singhal has said his laptop was stolen some time ago.

Mr Singhal also denies any plot to blackmail Subway and claims he is the victim of the 'Sandwich Mafia', as he was forced to declare bankruptcy after the company allegedly promised him that if he closed his store he would be able to open a new one elsewhere. No new store became available.

'After they took my authorisation to close the store and I closed the store, then they completely changed their words,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was told that they don't have any new location right now and I might have to wait for two to three years for a new location.'

He said he lost his lifetime's savings due to Subway's 'as usual' deceptive behaviour'.

'Here a family man lost $350,000 in Subway's investment. They left me with no option then to declare bankruptcy. I told the "Sandwich Mafia" that if you don't compensate me for the loss of business, I am going to media to tell everyone about my story.'

He said '$35 million' was Subway's estimate of its losses if its trade secrets were revealed.

The company claims Mr Singhal wanted to destroy Subway's reputation or cause it loss, reported The Age.

'They lodged a lawsuit against me that I am blackmailing them in the lieu of secret recipe,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'Subway systems are the mastermind of the whole plan but they put that accusation on me.'

A Subway spokesman told The Age they were disappointed Mr Singhal had 'taken this route' and they would not be commenting any further.
