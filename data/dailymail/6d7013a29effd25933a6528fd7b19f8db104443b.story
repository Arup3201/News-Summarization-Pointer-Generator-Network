Veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis today said that his 'nightmare' was set to continue as it emerged that he will face a retrial over two sex charges.

Earlier this month, the star was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault, but jurors were unable to reach a verdict on one charge of indecent assault and one of sexual assault.

Today the Crown Prosecution Service told a court that it plans to prosecute Travis over the two remaining charges in a fresh trial.

He said outside court: 'The nightmare is now going to go on. All I can say is, this whole thing started when I was 67 and I just hope it will end by the time I'm 80.'

Trial: Dave Lee Travis, pictured outside court with his wife Marianne today, is set to face a retrial over one charge of indecent assault and one of sexual assault

Following a short hearing at Southwark
 Crown Court, the 68-year-old was bailed until March 28, when he will return to the court.

Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC told judge Anthony Leonard: 'The prosecution is seeking a retrial for two outstanding counts.'

Wearing a black suit and burgundy shirt and tie, Travis was allowed to remain seated in the dock as the matter was discussed.

Travis was previously accused of indecently assaulting 10 women and sexually assaulting another in alleged incidents dating back to 1976.

After
 more than 20 hours of deliberation, on February 13 jurors acquitted him
 of 12 charges, but were not able to agree on a charge of indecent assault against a woman in the early 1990s along with an 
alleged sexual assault on a journalist in 2008. 

Bail: Travis was told to return to the court on March 28 for the next hearing in the case

Ruling: Travis was cleared of 12 assault charges but jurors did not reach a verdict on two others

Mr Leonard told Travis today: 'You are to return to this court on the 28th March. You are re-admitted to bail as before.'

Ms Moore told the court a retrial would be likely to last just over two weeks.

Marianne, Travis's wife of more than 40 years, supported him from the public gallery during today's hearing.

After being cleared of the 12 counts earlier this month, Travis said he had been through 'a year and a half of hell'.

Speaking
 outside the court moments after being found not guilty of the 12 
offences, he said the case had cost him his reputation along with so 
much money that he has had to sell his house.

Travis,
 who went on trial under his birth name David Griffin, said: 'I don't 
feel like there is a victory in any way, shape or form.'

'Hell': Travis speaking outside court on February 13 after he was found not guilty of 12 indecent assault charges

The 12 charges of which Travis was 
found not guilty related to nine different women, none of whom can be 
named for legal reasons.

One
 alleged victim told the court she was an 18-year-old clerk at the BBC 
in 1976 when Travis started offering her lifts in his yellow Pontiac, 
then molested her in the studio.

He told the court he did not give lifts to junior members of staff around the time of the alleged incident.

One
 of the witnesses said that Travis attacked her during a Showaddywaddy 
concert when she was just 15, saying 'I love big boobs' and flicking her
 nipples.

Another 
alleged attack was caught on camera, the court heard, as a 17-year-old 
claimed the DJ 'had a fumble' up her skirt while he was presenting Top 
of the Pops in 1978.

Travis
 suggested that if he had been seen touching the girl, 'the book would 
have been thrown at me and I would have been out of the BBC'.

In
 the early 1980s, he allegedly stood behind a trainee radio announcer as
 she was introducing Women's Hour on Radio 4 live on air.

However,
 Travis said that although he and his fellow DJs were keen on practical 
jokes he would never have interrupted a BBC broadcast.

In court: A sketch of Travis at Southwark Crown Court during his original trial

Travis was accused of assaulting a receptionist in his room at a hotel in Bude, Cornwall, as he toured the country with Radio 1 in 1983 or 1984.

Around the same time, he was alleged to have molested a student union official when he was performing at Nottingham Polytechnic University.

He denied both claims when he was on the stand.

The DJ was also alleged to have assaulted a British Airways worker on two occasions when he hosted corporate events for the airline in the 1990s.

The woman, who was 23 at the time, said Travis singled her out on the dancefloor and made her dance the lambada with him, and claimed he became aroused as he 'grinded' against her.

Asked about the BA employee's claims in court, Travis replied: 'Am I allowed to laugh? Because I’m sorry, it’s a situation which did not happen.'

A former employee of Chiltern FM, which shared a building with Classic Gold when the DJ was working there, said that she confronted Travis in the newsroom, calling him a 'pervert' after he put his hand up her skirt.

He insisted the claims were 'completely 100 per cent fabricated', adding that any physical contact must have come when he accidentally brushed against her during an argument.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
