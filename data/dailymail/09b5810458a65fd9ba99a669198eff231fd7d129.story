A fitness fanatic has been crushed to death by weight-training equipment he had only just bought, to 'save on gym fees'.

Chris Bailey was found sprawled on the work out bench trapped beneath the weight of the heavy bar, which was laid across his chest.

It was believed he had been dead for several hours before his body was discovered in the garage of his home.

Police said they were treating the death as 'unexplained' while they waited for the results of a post-mortem examination today.

Mr Bailey had bought a workout bench just weeks before the tragic accident took place

Mr Bailey, who had spent the evening drinking with friends, was last seen alive by his landlord Oliver Steer heading into the garage where he kept his gym equipment at 3am.

The grim discovery of his body was made just before 1pm on Sunday.

Mr Steer, 57, said: 'I found him on the bench with the bar across his chest.'

'I tried to wake him but I knew he was dead. I had to try and lift the weight off him which wasn't easy because it was so heavy.

'I tried to resuscitate him but he was gone.

'Police told me he must have been dead for at least five hours when I found him. I don't think he had gone to bed. He was still wearing the same clothes.'

Safety: It is recommended that weight lifters always have someone 'spotting' them while they train who can help them if they get into difficulty (picture posed by models)

Mr Steer said his lodger, who he described as a 'lovely kid', had only

bought the workout bench six weeks earlier.

He said:'Chris was right into his fitness stuff, he had a bike and he loved to ride it.

'I think he bought the kit to save money on gym fees.

'He should never have tried to lift weights those heavy by himself, he should have had someone to spot him.'

Mr Bailey, who was originally from Nottingham working at a bakery near his home in Portslade, West Sussex.

A police spokesman said: 'Police were called to a house in Mill Close, Portslade, following reports that the body of a 28-year-old man had been found in the garage on Saturday May 19.

'Officers received a call from the owner of the property at around 12.45pm and on arrival the man was found lying on a weights bench in the garage. He had been dead for several hours.

'The death is currently being treated as unexplained and the matter has been referred to the coronerâ€™s officer.'
