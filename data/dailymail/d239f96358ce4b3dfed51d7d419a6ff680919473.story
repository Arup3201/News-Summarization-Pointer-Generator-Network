Arrested: Raymond Michael Miranda, 14 (pictured) has been accused of viciously beating an 87-year-old woman at a California nursing home

A 14-year-old boy accused of brutally beating an elderly woman while she slept in her nursing home bed, has been arrested following a nearly week-long manhunt in California.

Police nabbed Raymond Michael Miranda in a Temecula hotel room last night over the April 17 attack which left an 87-year-old woman fighting for her life in hospital.

Raymond and a 15-year-old boy allegedly broke into the unidentified woman's room at the Camelot Independent Living complex in Hemet and violently beat her in a botched robbery attempt about 2am. Some reports also claim they splashed bleach on the victim.

While officials are legally prohibited from identifying juvenile suspects, investigators made an exception with Raymond who they say is dangerous.

While the 15-year-old boy was arrested on the day of the attack, officers were forced to circulate fliers with Raymond's name and photo in order to find him.

A neighbor told police they spotted the teenage boys outside the woman's living quarters on West Oakland Avenue in the early morning hours of April 17.

'It's
 an 87-year-old victim minding her own business in the safety of her own
 home,' police Lt. Dean Evans told the Riverside Press-Enterprise.

'(She was) accosted and beaten severely and is now in critical condition. The feeling is, if they’ll do that to an 87-year-old lady, they’ll do it to anyone else they come across. So we feel the public might be at risk and we want to prevent that.'

Investigators said it appeared the victim was not specifically targeted and they don't know how long the 'torture' lasted. They believe burglary was the motive.

Evans told Riverside Press-Enterprise that Raymond has had 'extensive contacts' with Hemet police.

'I know he has some contact with the juvenile justice system,' the lieutenant said, but did not provide details.

Raymond's arrest warrant alleges attempted murder, burglary and torture.
