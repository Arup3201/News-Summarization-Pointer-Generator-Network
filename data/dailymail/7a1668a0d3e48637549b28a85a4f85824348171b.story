Jo Keeling was inspired to write a series of children's books after her daughter Isabelle (now five) saved her life

A toddler who saved her mother's life by dialling 999 when she collapsed has inspired her to write a series of fun books teaching children what to do in an emergency.

Isabelle Keeling was just two-years-old when she called an ambulance after her mother Jo suffered a life-threatening anaphylactic shock.

Isabelle was able to recite her name, phone number and address perfectly and even opened the door for paramedics when they arrived to treat her mother.

Afterwards Ms Keeling realised Isabelle had saved her life and thought other parents could benefit from teaching their children how to respond in an emergency.

She has written six books for children based around the characters Izzy and Ollie (named after her two children), who are placed in emergency situations.

The first publication, 'Adventure in an Ambulance', focuses on how to call an ambulance.

Others in the collection discuss car seatbelts, talking to strangers, and not running away from parents.

Ms Keeling, 37, a police officer from Bournemouth, Dorset, said: 'My initial plan was to write a children's story for a website so other parents could print it out.

'But a nursery advised me to turn it into a book which I thought could work, and I have spent the last two years working on that.

'When Isabelle called the ambulance in 2009 people were calling her a genius when in fact it was something all children should know.

Jo hopes her books will help other parents teach their children how to respond in an emergency

'As a mum and a police officer I taught her to remember her name and address by using the 'Frere Jacques' tune.

'We had practised using the phone together before and played a pretend game where I called an ambulance after her little brother was ill.

'She had also watched an episode of the Tweenies just a day before I had the reaction which must have triggered her memory.

'Since then other parents have told me they used the techniques on my website to teach their children how to use the phone.

'I hope the books can help someone with any problems they might have, for example diabetes or a heart condition, when you might not be able to get to the phone yourself.'Her first book will cost Â£7.99 is available to buy through Amazon and her website www.izzyandollie.com
