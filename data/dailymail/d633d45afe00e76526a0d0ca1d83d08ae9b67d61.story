Hundreds of motorcyclists dressed up in festive fancy-dress took part in a charity drive yesterday.

The bikers hit the road dressed up as Santa, elves, and even a Christmas dinner, on rides kitted out with fairy lights, tinsel and Rudolph noses.

Charity Santa’s On A Bike attracted up to
 600 riders on 400 vehicles travelling in convoy through Bristol to 
raise money for Children’s Hospice South West.

The fancy-dress charity ride has been an annual event since 2004 and it is organised by Rolls Royce worker Will Brown.

Speaking to The Bristol Post before 
the event he said: ‘We know there are people coming from 
Birmingham, Swindon and Lyme Regis to join in.

‘I think it's because we're the only 
one in the South West and we are inclusive – we have teenagers with 
their L-plates and we have pensioners on bikes that are older than me.

The 52-year-old from Bradley Stoke emphasized the event's focus on helping the children and raising money for the hospice.

‘We ask the hospice who will be there and what presents the children would like, to make sure we get things that are suitable.

‘It's a really emotional day. We've 
had occasions when we've bought presents on a Monday and the child has 
died on the Thursday and there is another child there on the Friday.’

Last year the Santa’s On A Bike raised a record £10,000 and hope to match the figure.

Several charity events involving 
Father Christmas took place this weekend, including the annual Santa Dash
 in Liverpool earlier today and an American ski resort filling its 
slopes with revellers in red.

The Santa Dash is a Liverpool Christmas tradition with a twist, as it sees many runners forgo the traditional red suit for a 
blue one.

The reason for the 'Blue Christmas' is one of loyalty, as supporters of Everton FC refuse to run in the colours
 of rival football team Liverpool FC.

This year's run, which saw 8,000 people take part, raised money for ITV's Text Santa appeal which is supporting six UK charities, including Age UK and Marie Curie Cancer Care.

At a U.S. ski-resort in Maine, nearly 300 skiers and snowboarders in full Santa gear gathered for the 13th annual Santa Sunday.

The event, held at the Sunday River resort in Newry, raises money for the local Rotary Club’s holiday toy drive.
