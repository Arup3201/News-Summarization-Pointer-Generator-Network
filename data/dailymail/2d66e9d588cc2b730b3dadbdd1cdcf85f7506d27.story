Flying into fresh controversy: Presenter Jeremy Clarkson pictured at Heathrow Airport on Thursday

There were growing concerns yesterday about Jeremy Clarkson’s ‘vulnerable state of mind’ and the precarious state of his 18-year marriage after he provoked a fresh storm of protest.

The Top Gear presenter made offensive comments about people who commit suicide – the second time that he has been at the centre of controversy in the space of a few days.

One senior BBC insider, who asked not to be named, last night said Clarkson had moved out of the  family home he shares with second wife Frances and wasn’t in ‘the best possible place at the moment’.

He said: ‘There is a feeling that he’s in a more vulnerable state than he should be and that’s why his judgment isn’t A-grade at the moment.’

Clarkson, who is reportedly paid £1million a year by the BBC, used his weekly column in The Sun newspaper to expand on comments he had made about suicide on The One Show on Wednesday night. He wrote that ‘foxy woxy and the birds’ should be left to ‘nibble’ at the ‘gooey parts’ of people who die by jumping in front of trains.

Last night three of the country’s leading mental health charities  said they would complain to the Press Complaints Commission about the remarks, which they said intruded on private grief and breached PCC guidelines which restrict what newspapers can report about suicides for fear of encouraging copycat incidents.

Clarkson, 51, had already provoked uproar on Wednesday by joking on The One Show about suicides and then calling for striking public  sector workers to be shot in front  of their families.

The One Show immediately issued an on-air apology for the star’s remarks about suicide but did not address his comments about strikers.

The BBC subsequently apologised over the remarks about the strikers, after it received more than 21,000 complaints.

It was widely assumed that Clarkson had also apologised for the remarks. But he denied having done so in his column yesterday.

Corporation bosses had hoped the apologies would draw a line under the storm but Clarkson’s decision to return to the subject of what he called ‘Johnny Suicides’ in his newspaper column has only plunged him deeper into controversy.

Paul Farmer, chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said: ‘Jeremy Clarkson’s article in The Sun is extraordinarily tasteless and shows an utter lack of understanding of the tragedy of any suicide.

‘Many people who have contemplated suicide seriously or lost loved ones will be shocked by his insensitive tone and needless graphic detail.’

Under the heading ‘Think of the poor driver before your leap in front of Ivor’, Clarkson said he had every sympathy with those who felt the need to take their own lives.

But he went on to argue that  suicide victims who ‘hurled’ themselves in front of trains were self-ish and disruptive because they inconvenienced other members of the public.

He wrote: ‘It is a very selfish way to go because the disruption it causes is immense. And think of what it’s like for the poor train driver who sees you lying on the line and can do absolutely nothing to avoid a collision.’

Clarkson then bemoans the fact that trains which are involved in a collision with a person must stop until the full aftermath of the incident has been dealt with and all remains have been recovered from the vicinity.

He wrote: ‘The train cannot be moved nor the line re-opened until all of the victim’s body has been recovered.

‘This is the part I don’t understand. It’s not like the poor soul is going to get any better.

‘Change the driver, pick up the big bits of what’s left of the victim, get the train moving as soon as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble away at the smaller, gooey parts that are far away or hard to find.’

Clarkson advises potential suicide victims to kill themselves quietly and privately.

Catherine Johnstone, the chief 
executive of the Samaritans, which is campaigning to reduce the number 
of suicides on the railway network, said the comments in the column went
beyond what he had said about suicide on The One Show and were far 
worse than anything he had ever said about striking  public sector 
workers.

Clarkson's first wife: Alex Hall married him in 1989 but the couple separated a year later

She said: ‘His 
notion that suicide  is a selfish act shows how little he knows about 
the subject because, if he did, he would know that when a person 
attempts suicide they are so distressed that they genuinely believe 
their families will be better off without them. The fact that he has 
chosen to add fuel to the flames of the comments he made on The One Show
again beggars belief.

‘It’s one thing to joke about people on strike, it’s in an entirely different realm of poor taste to joke about  suicide.’

Clarkson’s column also sparked an avalanche of complaints on Twitter and other social networking sites.

One fan tweeted: ‘Please stop. Shooting the strikers is one thing, but this is pretty indefensible. Beware sarcasm in print.’ Another added: ‘Really shocked by the  “train suicide” comments. Used  to like Jeremy Clarkson. Not so much now.’

But there were some signs of  support 
on Twitter and elsewhere. Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain,  of Maidenhead 
Synagogue, said: ‘I am totally sympathetic to the black depression that 
overtakes  those who commit suicide, and  certainly want to prevent any 
future ones, but Clarkson has done us a favour by saying out aloud that 
while people have the right to end their lives, they should not do so in
a way that scars others.’

News
of Clarkson’s marriage  difficulties comes nine months after 
allegations surfaced that  the presenter had been having  a 14-month 
affair with events organiser Philippa Sage, who works for a company 
which helped produce the Top Gear Live show.

Two
months later the millionaire presenter was forced to deny reports he 
had been thrown out  of the marital home in Chipping Norton, 
Oxfordshire, by his  wife after he wrote about the delights of living in
an unfurnished flat in Central London. A day later Clarkson said that 
he had simply been using the flat as a bolt-hole while he was filming in
London.

The BBC last night declined to comment on Clarkson’s column in yesterday’s Sun.

A
BBC spokesman was unable to comment on anything relating  to the 
presenter’s private life and was unable to reach Clarkson because he was
in China.

One of the first rules of being a  high-profile media talking head is  that when you’ve gone too far you apologise – and move on.

But Jeremy Clarkson appeared to be digging himself into a deeper hole yesterday when he denied that he had apologised for his comments about striking public sector workers.

In his column in The Sun, Clarkson insisted that while he had apologised for his remarks about suicide on The One Show he had not said sorry for his demand that strikers should be shot.

No regrets: Clarkson denied that he ever apologised for comments me made about striking public sector workers

He wrote: ‘According to Twitter, Facebook and all the other modern-day versions of the Clapham Omnibus, the BBC were forced to apologise this  week after I went on The One Show and said that all public service workers who went on strike should be executed in front of their families. This is not true.

‘I backed the strikers and then, to make a point about the need for impartiality, said they should be shot. In fact, the BBC apologised about my later remarks about people who jump in front of trains.’

Sources close to Clarkson have claimed that the presenter warned The One Show production team about what he was intending to say on air in one of the regular briefing meetings immediately before transmission.

They claim fault for the controversy lies not with Clarkson but with the BBC which allowed the item to go ahead.

However, insiders on the programme, which is watched by five million viewers every night, dispute this.

They insist that Clarkson was told that he should avoid anything that was likely to provoke controversy.

One, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Every guest who comes on to The One Show is briefed about the running order of the programme. It is a live programme which features topical news reports and it is only fair guests know what to expect. In the briefing, Jeremy did make reference to comments about shootings and killings as well as a load of other stuff.

‘The producer dealing with the briefing made it clear in no uncertain terms that Jeremy should avoid any comments that would be controversial.  

‘He was also reminded of the need  to ensure that his comments were balanced. The One Show team member dealing with the briefing left that room assured that their advice had been taken onboard.

‘It is telling that when Jeremy did make the comments about the executions he very deliberately  made a reference to balance.’

Sources say that The One Show production team were horrified by the comments and gave Clarkson the opportunity to apologise on air. The presenter declined.

Insiders also say Clarkson was briefed on the show’s running order four days earlier. The source said: ‘He promised not to say anything controversial. His only concern was that he would finish the programme so he could make his plane to China on time.’
