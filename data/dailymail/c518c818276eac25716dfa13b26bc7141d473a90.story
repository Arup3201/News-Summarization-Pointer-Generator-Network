Kevin Pietersen has offered one-on-one coaching to a young cricketing prospect after receiving a heart-warming letter at his book signing on Tuesday evening.

Pietersen posted the letter on his Instagram account on Wednesday, where the young boy named Rohan said he had been chosen for Cheshire Under 11s and couldn't afford £10,000 to be coached by the former England star.

He offered £1,000, but Pietersen insisted he was delighted to do the session for free. The money, it must be said, would normally go to charity.

Read the letter below:

He said: 'I received this letter at my signing session last night. I have never profited from a one on one. Only ever done them for charity but this letter touched me. 

I would be delighted to coach you at The Oval and I will organise all your transport so that it doesn't cost you a penny, Rohan!' 

The 34-year-old's book, KP: My Autobiography, was released on Monday and in it he lacerated the likes of Andy Flower, Matt Prior and Graeme Swann.

Pietersen said he would give the coaching session for free, as he says he always does
