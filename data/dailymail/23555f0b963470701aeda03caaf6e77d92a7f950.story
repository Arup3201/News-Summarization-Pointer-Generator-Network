Bradford goalkeeper Ben Williams said the Bantams were 'living the dream' after beating Sunderland to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals.

A 2-0 win for the League One side over their Premier League visitors was secured by an early John O'Shea own goal and Jon Stead's strike against his former club.

'It was thoroughly deserved. The boys have performed fantastically well. We limited Sunderland to hardly any chances,' Williams said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

Valley Parade was packed out for the fifth-round clash, after Bradford's win over Chelsea last month, and the celebrations were under way even before the final whistle.

'You can see the scenes here. It's fantastic for everyone involved,' said Williams.

'We've performed fantastically well - the boys don't need any encouragement. We're playing against brilliant opposition and they're all up for it. A full packed house and everyone's up for the game.

'From the first whistle everyone ran their socks off, worked hard for each other, and it's thoroughly deserved.

'With the form we're in at the moment well take anyone at home (in the quarter-finals).

'Being in this position, in the quarter-finals of the cup, it's a massive reward and bonus for everyone. We're just living the dream at the moment.'

Stead added: 'We've done it again and we're obviously buzzing.'
