Expectant mom Chelsea Clinton was full of smiles on Saturday afternoon, as she strolled through the May sunshine in New York with husband Marc Mezvinsky.

With only a slight hint of a bump on show, the 34-year-old looked relaxed and healthy as she and Mezvinsky walked their Yorkshire terrier through Madison Square Park.

Appearing still very much in love four years after their wedding, the soon-to-be parents were spotted laughing and chatting together.

On show: A hint of a baby bump could be seen as Chelsea Clinton strolled through Manhattan with her husband, Marc, on Saturday afternoon

A gently bulging baby bump was on show under the loose-fitting top Clinton had teamed with dark jeans and a maroon coat.

At one point, she cradled her terrier as her husband stopped to buy a snack from a food vendor.

Clinton had been spotted earlier on Saturday too, as she headed out for breakfast in the Flatiron district.

Make up free, and with her blonde hair loosely tied back this morning, the vice-chairwoman of the Clinton Foundation looked relaxed as she wrapped a large beige cardigan around her bump.

Clinton announced that she and Mezvinsky are expected their first child, during a Clinton Foundation event in April.

She told guests at the event, set up to empower young women: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.'

'I certainly feel all the better whether itâ€™s a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders...

'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.'

Hillary Clinton followed the announcement with an excited Twitter post. She wrote: 'My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be! @billclinton and I are thrilled that Chelsea and Marc are expecting their first child!'

Husband Bill echoed her words with a tweet of his own, reading: 'Excited to add a new line to my Twitter bio...grandfather-to-be! @hillaryclinton and I are so happy for Chelsea and Marc!'

Chelsea Clinton has showed no signs of slowing down with her charity's work during this early part of her pregnancy.

On Tuesday she was pictured next to Robert F Kennedy Jr, son of the late Bobby Kennedy, as she was recognized for her work promoting clean and safe water in New York City.

For that event, Clinton opted for a black skirt suit and ruffled white shirt that cleverly disguised any sign of a growing bump.
