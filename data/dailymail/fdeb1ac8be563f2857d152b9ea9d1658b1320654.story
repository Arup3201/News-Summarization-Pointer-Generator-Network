Barcelona defender Gerard Pique has agreed a three-year contract extension that ties him to the club until 2019.

The Spain international has been an integral part of Barcelona's success, helping the club win two Champions Leagues titles and five of the past six league trophies since his arrival in 2008.

Barcelona did not release financial terms of the deal, which the club says will be signed 'in the next 10 days.'Â
