Security has been stepped up around French president Francois Hollande after a gun-wielding man tried to break into the Elysée Palace.

The would-be intruder, who has not been named, was arrested at the gates of the head of state’s official Paris home on Sunday afternoon.

It led to fears that the 30-year-old was trying to mimic an attempt on the life of former French president Jacques Chirac a decade ago.

Visitors walk in the gardens of the Elysée Palace in Paris, the official state home of President Francois Hollande, on Saturday. The next day a man wielding a gun tried to break into the building

Mr Hollande and his companion Valerie Trierweiler leave the palace to greet the public on Saturday, which was Bastille Day in France. Every year on July 14, the Elysée Palace is open to visitors

Referring to the latest incident, in 
which no-one was hurt, a police source in the French capital said: ‘The 
man was carrying a gun, which turned out to be a replica 7.65mm pistol.

‘He
was carrying false papers, and provided no motive for what he did. He 
remains in custody, and the Paris prosecutors’ office has recommended 
that he receives psychiatric care.

'In the meantime, security has certainly been tightened around the President.’

The
French were celebrating their national Bastille Day holiday at the 
weekend – a time traditionally associated with attempted attacks on 
politicians.

Many who 
attended the military parade in the Champs Elysée on Saturday commented 
on what appeared to be lax security around Mr Hollande, a down-to-earth 
Socialist who styles himself as ‘Mr Normal’.

At one stage he mingled with members of a crowd who had not undergone any kind of security checks.

Flashback: The incident led to fears that the man was trying to mimic an attempt by Maxime Brunerie, pictured being arrested, on the life of former French president Jacques Chirac in 2002

Mr Hollande was away from the Elysée 
Palace on Sunday when the attempted break-in happened, but was kept 
fully informed about what occurred.

In
2002, Maxime Brunerie, a 25-year-old management student and neo-Nazi, 
tried to assassinate Mr Chirac during the annual Bastille Day parade.

He
pulled a gun from a guitar case and got a shot off as Mr Chirac was 
driven by in an open-topped jeep, but the would-be killer was restrained
by onlookers.

Brunerie later admitted that he had been depressed and was seeking infamy as the murderer of a famous politician.

He
was found guilty of attempted murder, receiving a relatively light 
ten-year sentence on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He was 
freed in 2009, after serving seven years.
