When it comes to 'dancing' these giraffes are definitely head and shoulders above the rest.

The beautiful creatures appeared to be performing an elegant routine as they crossed their necks and 'swayed' in time to the music in a series of synchronised moves.

Despite their size the giraffes appeared to create perfect symmetry in what looked like a graceful dance number.

Two giraffes in Kenya appeared to be dancing as they were photographed fighting for dominance

The behaviour of crossing their necks is known as 'necking' and is used to establish strength in the group

But while the gentle giants appeared calm and graceful, the pair were in fact fighting for dominance.

Known as 'necking', the two males are seen swinging their huge necks in an attempt to take out their opponent.

But incredibly, despite the duo's aggressive behaviour, the giraffe's movements still managed to be easy on the eye.

Still, the behaviour is graceful and quite rare to observe, yet was snapped by a Russian wildlife photographer

Taken by wildlife photographer, Andrey Gudkov, 42, on the plains of the Masai Mara, Kenya, the Russian managed to snap the giraffes from the safety of his safari jeep.

Andrey said: 'Sometimes this behaviour is known as dancing but actually, the two males were fighting to see who is the strongest in the group.

'These fights can be very brutal and can last from a few minutes up to an hour.

The stunning movements, made in unison, are quite unusual to see for yourself in the wild

'I believe it's the job of the photographer to show the world these amazing moments,' Andrey said

'It is fascinating to watch and even though they are in battle they are still incredibly graceful in their movements.

'Generally, these type of moments are very interesting and it is quite unusual to see for yourself in the wild. 

'Looking back the giraffes to appear to move in unison making for some very beautiful photographs.

'I believe it is the job of the photographer to show the rest of the world these amazing moments.'
