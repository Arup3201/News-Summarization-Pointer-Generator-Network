A Florida man running for a seat in the state legislature is standing behind a Tweet where he wrote 'It's time to arrest the President and 'hang him high.'

Josh Black says he did not expect all the attention he got over his Tweet. He's says he's Tweeted negatively about the President before and he's not backing down on his opinions.

'I know that we don't use hanging as a method of execution here in the U.S. anymore, so be it. Whatever method is applicable for the situation, I just want justice to be served,' said the candidate.

Black says he was having a Twitter conversation with others who oppose many of the President's actions.

High him high: 'I know that we don't use hanging as a method of execution here in the U.S. anymore, so be it. Whatever method is applicable for the situation, I just want justice to be served,' said the candidate, Joshua Black

Bring him to justice: Joshua Black explained in his opinion the President has committed multiple crimes and if he's tried and convicted, President Obama should be killed

In regards to deadly drone strikes against US citizens in the middle east, Black wrote, 'I'm past impeachment. It's time to arrest and hang him high.'

His tweet, where Black agreed with someone who said the president should be 'hung high,' came from anger over a 2011 drone strike that killed Anwar al-Awalki, an American-born al Qaeda planner in Yemen.

Al-Awlaki's son died soon after in a strike officials later admitted was a mistake.

'I believe that every murder should face the death penalty. When George Zimmerman took out Trayvon Martin everyone wanted justice, ok, so we stick him in front of a jury and put him on trial and we give the evidence to a jury and we see what they say. If they say guilty. Death penalty,' said Black.

Blinded by his views: The political newcomer said he doesn't fear U.S. Secret Service agents showing up on his doorstep. Many voters might agree with his position, he said, adding: 'I guess they're going to call me a racist now.'

Crazy: Joshua Black, who is running to represent District 68 in the Sunshine state, argued that President Barack Obama should be executed for his foreign policies, according 'I¿m past impeachment,' Black wrote on Twitter. 'It¿s time to arrest and hang him high.'

Extremist: Despite widespread criticism for his comments, Black is not backing down. ¿He should be executed for treason,' Black said. 'I think the appropriate punishment is death.'

The man currently in office, Dwight Dudley says is flawed that anyone would tweet about hanging the President, but he was shocked it turned out be his opponent in the race to represent District 68.

'I think people reveal themselves in what they say. They reveal there true feelings and beliefs, I hope he doesn't truly believe that the President should be hung. I think that's outrageous and wrong,' said Dudley to ABC News.

Among others lashing out at the black, Republican candidate house candidate Chris Latvala took to Twitter, writing 'I know you are crazy but good heavens. U R an embarrassment.' He called him the 'loser of the week.'

Criticized: Joshua Black certainly didn't make any friends with his outspoken Tweets and Facebook comments

Defending his comments: Hours after the tweet, Black defended his comment. Obama should be held responsible for ordering a drone strike that killed a U.S. citizen overseas, he said

Black, a former street minister, now drives a taxi to make a living,

He says all this attention is weighing hard on him and his pregnant wife. But he spent Tuesday answering to his Tweet and even meeting with the Secret Service.

He says he isn't in any trouble with the government or anyone else and doesn't believe his remarks incite violence against the president.

'Not with all the guns he has around him, no. That's the whole reason for having Secret Service, that's the whole reason for having firearms, is personal protection.'

'When you say something you got to own it. And I said what I said, and I'm gonna own it,' Black said.

Despite of all the negative attention, he is still continuing his campaign for the State House as a Republican candidate.
