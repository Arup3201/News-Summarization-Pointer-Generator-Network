Convicted rapist Luke Lazarus has told a courtroom that he believes he could have been a CEO and had the 'world at his feet' before his conviction.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the 23-year-old lived a very lavish lifestyle in Vaucluse with his parents and held a graduate marketing position with beverage company Lion.

Lazarus' father is known for owning prominent nightclubs in Kings Cross and Bondi Junction.

'I essentially had the world at my feet,' he told Sydney's District Court.

'My life, at least in Australia, has been completely destroyed and now I have to live the rest of my life knowing every single person in Australia, or at least Sydney, knows I have been convicted of a sex offence,' The Daily Telegraph reported Lazarus as saying before breaking down in court.

Lazarus still believes that the incident in May 2013 was completely consensual.

During the trial, the jury were told that Lazarus told the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at his father's club, the SOHO, before and ushered her into an alleyway.

The woman attempted to go back inside but Lazarus forcefully told her to get down on the ground on all fours.

He then sexually assaulted her for ten minutes and afterward, put her phone number in his phone.

She informed police the next morning who seized CCTV footage from the venue which confirmed Lazarus led the woman into the alleyway.

Text messages from the evening show Lazarus messaging a friend saying he had no recollection of the night but he did take a woman's virginity and it was a 'pretty gross story.'

Lazarus told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement.'

He also added that it made him physically ill to think that the incident was not consensual.

The 23-year-old was allegedly seeing an American woman but ended the relationship due to his parent's disapproval of her not being Greek.

Psychiatrist Dr. Christopher Rikard-Bell, said Lazarus was suffering emotional symptoms as a result of the break up. Lazarus is to be sentenced on Friday.
