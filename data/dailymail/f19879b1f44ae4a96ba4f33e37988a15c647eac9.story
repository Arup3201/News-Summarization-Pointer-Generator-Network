The great big glass feathers clank heavily when you set them off. 'Aren't they gorgeous?' says chandelier specialist Amanda Holly. They are hypnotic — hanging from the ceiling like giant shards of ice. Lit up they must be quite something.

These days everyone can have a show-stopping light at home and there are chandelier reproductions all over the High Street.

But if you want something extra special, or a bit of guidance on what will work best, then interiors website rubyinthedust.co.uk is a good place to look for inspiration.

Glitzy: One of Amanda's murano glass chandeliers adds character to this room

Amanda, who set up the company, knows how to add glamour to a setting. There is lashings of sparkle in her house, which is filled with crystal-studded mirrors that light up in theatrical style and Seventies' chandeliers.

Think of the styling in the film American Hustle, or the glittering decadence of The Great Gatsby, and you get the idea.

Amanda sources her lights, furniture and mirrors from the UK and Europe, gives them a thorough clean-up and has them re-wired.

Most of the chandeliers are French or Italian. And her favourite projects are for individuals, who want a touch of daring in whichever room, but need some direction.

It's a bit like getting a personal stylist to choose the right outfit. 'I ask women how they dress — if they wear a large, statement necklace or are happier with a simple drop pendant — that will give a clue to what they feel comfortable with,' Amanda says. It also depends on what sort of ambience you are aiming for at home — whether you favour a soothing retreat or something more showy. It's important to get a piece as flamboyant as a chandelier right.

Amanda has always been a collector — beginning with her grandmother's jewellery, and moving on to glass. 'The thrill of the find' inspires her to scour markets and fairs year-round. She is a great advocate for injecting nostalgia, stories and a personal touch into our living spaces with antique pieces. 'You wonder who has looked into those mirrors before you,' she ponders.

If you live in a flat or suburban semi, there is no need to shy away from a big chandelier. Quite the opposite. A statement piece can create the illusion of space and distract from less interesting features. And you can achieve the look without spending a fortune — with prices starting from £500.

Amanda suggests trying a wall-mounted style. She has an example in her dining room — a Triedi Murano chandelier — which cascades like a waterfall down the wall.

You could also try hanging a light over the staircase — where there is plenty of room for the drop. And for low ceilings, she advises flush mounted lights, which won't intrude too much, or pretty crystal wall lights to shimmer in a hallway. Globe pendants work well in Victorian flats with high ceilings, she adds.

Some people follow mathematical rules when it comes to proportions (size of chandelier versus height of the room) — but Amanda believes it's best to trust your instinct.

Muted colours and minimal style are beginning to go out of fashion, says Amanda.

Now the recession is easing, people are starting to spend again, and they want luxury — and even a touch of extravagance.

Glittering: If you have a tall enough ceiling, you can go for it with a gigantic, feature chandelier

It's a perfect fit for 'Hollywood Regency', which is how Amanda describes her style. It's a look which harks back to the glamour associated with the film industry — crystals, silks, over-the-top details — combined with classical furniture.

The term was originally coined in the 1930s and made popular by celebrities like Joan Crawford and the first lady, Nancy Reagan.

The idea is that the home is a display designed for entertaining, while hinting at the personality of the owner.

Amanda's lights are not short on character.

She has a peacock lamp (complete with real feathers captured between the blue green glass) in her cloakroom.

That, as they say in the industry, is a good 'talking point'. No doubt her dinner party guests would agree.
