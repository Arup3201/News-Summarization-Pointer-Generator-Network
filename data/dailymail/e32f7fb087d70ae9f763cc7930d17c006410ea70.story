When Michael Ware's 15-year-old daughter killed three friends in a tragic Labor Day weekend car crash, her father told police that she took the SUV without his permission.

It's now been revealed that Ware was lying, and actually encouraged his unlicensed daughter to go for the joy ride to a local barbecue restaurant with five friends - as long as she brought him back a sandwich.

Now both father and daughter are facing charges for the crash that killed 15-year-old Pennsylvania boys Cullen Keffer, Shamus Digney and Ryan Lesher the morning of August 30. 

Responsibility: A 15-year-old girl from Westchester, New York killed three boys of the same age in a car crash last labor day weekend.  It was originally reported that the driver, who did not have a license, took the car without permission. It has since been revealed that her father, Michael Ware, let her driver her friends in his SUV that day and even asked her to bring him back a breakfast sandwich

Victims: Michael Ware was arraigned Wednesday on several charges related to the August 30 crash which claimed the lives of 15-year-old Pennsylvania boys Cullen Keffer (left), Shamus Digney (center) and Ryan Lesher (right)

On Wednesday, Ware was arraigned in court on charges of involuntary manslaughter, endangering the welfare of children, welfare endangerment, making false reports and allowing an unauthorized person to drive his SUV. He is out on $100,000 bail. 

His daughter, who turns 16 on Saturday, was also arraigned this week, but since her case is in juvenile court, the charges have not been publicly released.

Ware and his daughter were charged after two of the friends who survived the wreck, came forward to tell a different story than what was originally reported at the crash scene. 

A 16-year-old girl who was vacationing with the Wares says the father allowed his daughter, who was not licensed at the time, to drive her friends in the 2001 Chevrolet Suburban to a local barbecue restaurant.

She says Ware's dad walked them out to the car and even asked them to bring back a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich while seeing them off. 

Furthermore, she says her friend drove most of the journey from their suburb north of New York City to the Poconos  house.

The teen says that morning, she and Ware's daughter went to Dunkin' Donuts around 9:30am and then returned to the house. 

The girls then went to pick up the boys staying at Lesher's house. Lesher had friends Cullen Keffer, Shamus Digney, Ryan Lesher and another 15-year-old male friend from Council Rock South High School in Newton, Pennsylvania spending the weekend with him.

Classmates: Keffer, Digney and Lesher were all sophomores at Council Rock South High School in Newton, Pennsylvania 

On the way back from the restaurant, the teen was speeding when she rounded a corner and lost control of the SUV, which went off road and then flipped to land on the driver's side. The driver, her female friend and Lesher's other high school friend were able to escape the vehicle while Lesher, Keffer and Digney were trapped. 

Witness Marie Drobnicki, who lives on the road where the crash happened, told police that she heard boys' voices yelling 'slow down' before she heard the SUV flip. 

Lesher's friend who survived the accident also confirmed that the driver was 'flying' and that he and his friends told her to 'slow down,' according to court documents. 

Drobnicki ran to the scene and says she found one boy lying in the road, another pinned under the SUV and one who looked dead, lying on her lawn.  

Keffer died at the scene while Digney and Lesher passed away later that day at the hospital. 

Michael Ware arrived at the scene soon after the crash and told police that he was cleaning his home that morning when his daughter took the car without his permission. 

His daughter overheard the statement, and says she and her friend 'thought they were supposed to say they had the car without permission so as not to get him in trouble'. 

His daughter even dramatically admitted to speeding and asked police to arrest her.

'I was driving too fast ; arrest me,' she told police according to court documents, while holding her hands out in front of her 'as if waiting to be handcuffed'. 

Police found a breakfast sandwich in the vehicle, the one Michael Ware asked for, but didn't realize the  'evidentiary value' at the time.

'This was a horrific tragedy and, unfortunately, one that could have so easily been prevented,' Wayne County District Attorney Janine Edwards said in a press release, reported by Calkins Media. 'The law must be followed in order to prevent such a tragedy in the future.'
