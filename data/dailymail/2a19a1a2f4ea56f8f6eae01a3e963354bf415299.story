A close friend of the young woman who disguised herself as a boy to date girls has revealed how she narrowly escaped the sex offender.

Emily Barker, 18, spent months texting 'Luke Jones' - without realising 'he' was actually her friend, cross-dressing Gemma Barker, 19.

The trickster created alter egos so she could have sexual encounters with a 15 and 16-year-old victim.

Emily, 18, from Cobham, Surrey, told how she became smitten with 'Luke' after Barker showed her 'his' Facebook page.

She spent months flirting with 'him' 
via text message - but never met up with her friend posing as a boy, the
Daily Mirror reported.

Emily
went off the idea of going out with 'Luke' - who she described as very 
good-looking - when Barker said he was dating other girls.

Emily told the Daily Mirror: 'All the time I was texting Luke, it was Gemma. I have had a lucky escape.

'We would have met up on a date and it terrifies me to think what she may have done.'

Another friend, Natalie Frank, 18, who is gay, said it was a shock when she discovered that Gemma Barker was a lesbian and had been posing as a boy.

'Gemma knew I was gay but I never suspected she was interested in girls - she always told me she had a boyfriend,' she said.

'Luke Jones' was one of three alter egos that Barker, from Staines, Surrey, adopted as she carried out her extraordinary deception.

She also went by the names Aaron Lampard and Connor McCormack.

She tricked her victims by talking like a boy and wore boysâ€™ baggy clothes, hats and hooded tops.

Her two victims were completely taken in by her disguise - even though they had been to the same school as her.

Eventually
the two victims called police after becoming suspicious that their 
'boyfriend' was the same person - but neither realised that they were 
dating a girl.

Barker, who admitted two counts of sexual assault and one of fraud, is facing a possible jail term.

She has been released on bail ahead of her sentencing in March.
