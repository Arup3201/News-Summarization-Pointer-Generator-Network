Gender-neutral bathrooms will now be mandatory in West Hollywood following a law change aimed at making people with a non-traditional 'gender identity' more welcome.

The ordinance which takes effect tomorrow requires that restrooms with only one stall in restaurants, businesses and public places be gender neural. Under the change, the rest rooms can not be restricted to a specific sex either by signage or fixtures.

Existing businesses have 60 days to make changes, but new ones must heed the requirements immediately.

The Los Angeles suburb, which has a significant gay and transgender population, passed the ordinance in June. It doesn't apply to multiple-stall restrooms.

A statement released by the city said: 'Gender-specific restrooms can be unwelcoming and potentially unsafe for many people whose gender identity falls outside of traditional gender norms.'

The city said the law will also prove beneficial to 'people with disabilities or with personal attendants, people with children of a different gender, and to the many people who have waited in line for a gender-specific restroom' when stalls for the opposite sex are empty.

A similar law was passed in 2006 in Washington, D.C. Philadelphia passed a measure in 2013 that requires new or renovated city-owned buildings to include gender-neutral bathrooms.
