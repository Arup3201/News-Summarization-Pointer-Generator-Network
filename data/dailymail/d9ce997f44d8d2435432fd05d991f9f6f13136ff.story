A defining phenomenon at this World Cup for me has been the impact of special managers who have moulded their players into more than the sum of their parts. They all have a clear vision of how they want the game played, they get their teams playing like that.

And then - the truly magical part - they do this while maintaining group harmony.

The stand-out individuals in question have been, in no particular order, Jorge Sampaoli of Chile, Jose Pekerman of Colombia, Jurgen Klinsmann of the USA, Jorge Luis Pinto of Costa Rica, Miguel Herrera of Mexico and Louis Van Gaal of Holland, who made that extraordinary substitution on Saturday night, bring on Tim Krul for penalties..

Master: Holland boss Louis van Gaal has made an impact with key decisions during the 2014 World Cup 

But not Roy Hodgson, to whom we’ll return in a minute.

Herrera steered a stuttering team to the finals but has restored order from chaos by imposing his will.

He did not succumb to public demand and play my former Manchester United team-mate Javier Hernandez, aka Chicharito, despite him being a predator among predators.

Instead he had a belief in a system that worked well and refused to accommodate his star man. He had the respect and belief from all his squad, Chicharito included, and they reached the knockout stages.

Leaders: Jose Pekerman and Jorge Sampaoli were crucial to their team's impressive World Cup campaigns

Follow my lead: The Holland players seem to have total belief in their manager

Sampaoli is the Argentine in charge of a Chile side who were unlucky to lose to Brazil in the last 16. He got the job after  winning three titles with one of Chile’s biggest clubs, Universidad, and his side played the high-tempo, pressing game last seen under Marcelo Bielsa.

Two other words sum up Sampaoli’s transformative powers: Gary Medel. It seemed he couldn’t even pass the ball at times last season as Cardiff City were relegated from the Premier League, but he was intrinsic and superb at these finals.

Pekerman, Colombia’s Argentine coach, and Pinto, the Colombian in charge of Costa Rica, have each taken groups of players with few star names and instilled in them the confidence to express themselves in styles that play to the strengths of the collective, rather than to any  individual.

Klinsmann was always clear that his squad - from Seattle and  Hertha, from Toronto, Rosenborg, Puebla and other unheralded places in between - would never be less than competitive.

He was true to his word. He made a huge call even before getting to  Brazil by leaving Landon Donovan behind because he felt the team would benefit without a man who had earned 156 caps.

And they gave it a really good shot, getting out of a group they had no right to escape — at least on paper.

It was always likely England might struggle, as I wrote before the tournament. And there are all kinds of underlying issues to be addressed, as I outlined a fortnight ago. A visionary manager would help.

Hodgson is a pleasant-enough man, extremely intelligent and has a CV with enough clubs and countries to show how widely he is respected. But if I’m brutally honest then, for me, he lacks that extra ingredient to set him apart.

He’s certainly no maverick, he doesn’t change matches with inspirational substitutions and I see little evidence of a collective buying into a master plan for England, if there even is one.

It’s not just Hodgson who has failed to shine as England boss, of course. Fabio Capello’s boot camp approach was badly flawed, Steve McClaren was scarred by his failure, Sven-Goran Eriksson hit quarter-final buffers, Kevin Keegan himself admitted the job was too big for him.

So we’re left with Glenn Hoddle, the last England manager who had something really different about him — that vision. Certainly he was the best England manager in my personal experience. He didn’t have the best personality, and he wasn’t the most diplomatic at times. But he knew what he was trying to achieve tactically, and had a vision of how his unit should work.

I could imagine myself as part of bigger whole under him. Before Hoddle, even though I wasn’t an England player at the time, it’s clear Terry Venables also had a vision and the charisma to transmit that to his players.

What’s clear from some of the outstanding ‘lesser’ teams at this World Cup is that the team takes precedence over individuals and personalities in a way it didn’t for England.

Wing: Wayne Rooney (centre) was played out of position and England seemed to pay the price

Compromise takes you only so far. It was a compromise to play Wayne Rooney out of his favourite position. Build your side around your best player or drop him. But don’t fudge. The other managers above didn’t fudge and that’s what marks them out.

Van Gaal doesn’t fudge either. I’m sure you’ve heard all the stories of how eccentric he can be but I’ve not heard a bad word about him from any player he’s worked with.

He’s a hard man, strong, big on discipline within the football environment. But he also trusts his players.

The other night I was in a bar with some of his Holland squad. They were mixing with the public, having a bite to eat. They knew their curfew and would respect it.

He believes in his players. They believe in him. Having faith in the man in charge is a huge part of achieving success in our game. The best managers earn that faith.

Relaxed: Holland seem to have found the perfect balance between discipline and downtime in Brazil
