A five-year-old boy smuggled a kitchen knife into his primary school and told classmates it was for 'stabbing bad teachers'.

Horrified staff at Patrington Church of England Primary School, in Hull, East Yorkshire, overheard the pupil telling friends he had a knife in his schoolbag - before confiscating the weapon.

The boy was excluded from school for a week - but parents were outraged after the school hushed up the incident, and failed to tell them what had happened.

One parent, who did not wish to be named, said: 'You expect this type of thing to happen in American high schools, not an East Riding primary school.

'If there is an incident involving a knife at my child's school, I want to be told about it by the headteacher.'

The boy is believed to have taken the knife from his bag on arrival at school and showed it to two classmates before staff confiscated the weapon.

Although no direct threat was made to staff or other pupils and no one was injured, parents say they only learned about it after talking to one another at the school gates.

The unnamed parent said: 'I believe the school handled this completely wrong. Parents should have received a letter.

'The boy pulled the knife out of his bag at the start of the school day, in the cloakroom area.

'He showed the knife to two other small children. He was not jabbing it or anything like that, but he apparently told two other children that it was to stab the bad teachers with.

'My partner says when she dropped our son off at school the next day she saw a child crying. That boy's mum told her that he was scared he might be attacked if he misbehaved.

'Apparently, the school wanted to deal with it all internally, but I believe a meeting should have been arranged to discuss what happened.'

Staff at the school refused to answer enquiries but Eleanor Course, spokeswoman for the Diocese of York, said the incident happened on the morning of Monday, October 13.

She said: 'A child was overheard by a teacher at the school door of Patrington CofE Primary Academy saying he had a knife.

'A teacher located and removed a kitchen knife in the academy's cloakroom and the child was excluded for a week.

'The academy has been working with the child, his parent, and all appropriate safeguarding and behavioural support from the local authorities, to ensure the child is receiving all possible help.

'At no point were any children or staff in danger from the child in question, so the academy decided not to inform all parents.

'Patrington CofE Primary Academy is sorry that this decision has caused concern among parents, and would like to apologise for the worry this decision has created.

'However, the academy cannot inform the parents of the full details of the case, as the privacy and wellbeing of the child concerned and his family need to be taken into account.

'The academy wants to reiterate that no children were, or are, in any danger, and all possible steps have been put in place to ensure this incident will not be repeated.'

In April, mother-of-two Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed to death as she taught a classroom of pupils at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds. A memorial service was held last month to celebrate the teacher's life.

In America there has been a tragic history of killings in schools including at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut in 2012 when gunman Adam Lanza claimed 28 lives.

Earlier this year, 21 people were injured in a stabbing spree at Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania.
