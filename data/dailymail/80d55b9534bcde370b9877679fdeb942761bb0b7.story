A Connecticut teacher who repeatedly had sex with one of her teenage students in her car threatened to fail him when he tried to break off their affair, police have said.

Danielle Watkins, who is married with two young children, also sent the 18-year-old nude pictures during their eight-month relationship and supplied him and a friend with marijuana, cops said.

The 32-year-old teacher, who taught English at Stamford High School, turned herself into authorities in Stamford on Thursday and has been charged with sexual assault, among other charges.

The affair was revealed when the teen told a school counselor about their relationship in June. The counselor then alerted the Department of Children and Families and the Board of Education.

The boy waited until he had finished classes before going to authorities because, when he previously tried to call off the affair, Watkins said she would fail him and accused him of seeing someone else.

The pair allegedly had sex numerous times in her car as it was parked off school property during school hours, The Courant reported.

Watkins, a teacher for nine years, also allegedly bought marijuana for him and a 15-year-old friend - whom she also taught - and let him drive her car while knowing he did not have a license.

Her two students smoked the drug during school hours, sometimes on school grounds, the older boy told police.

On June 26, three days after telling the counselor about the affair, he went to Stamford Police to make a statement about the relationship. The 15-year-old boy also gave a statement to police.

On June 27, police officers pulled over Watkins' car and inside they found marijuana and a cell phone, which contained evidence she had sent naked photos of herself to the boy.

Lt. Diedrich Hohn, in charge of the 
case, told MailOnline that she was 'hostile' and 'verbally 
combative' during the search.

As cops pulled her over, she had tried to hide her cellphone under the 
passenger seat, he said.

Watkins allegedly exchanged more than 2,000 text messages and hundreds of phone calls with the teenager.

On Thursday, she was charged her with sexual assault and sale of marijuana in regard to the first victim and sale of marijuana and risk of injury to a minor in connection with the younger boy.

She was released on $100,000 bond and she is scheduled to appear in court July 31.

Superintendent Winifred Hamilton said Watkins has been placed on administrative leave until the investigation is complete.

'We are aware of the allegations,' Hamilton said. 'We take these issues very seriously and always act to protect the welfare of our students.'

Address records show Watkins, lives with a man, Jermaine, whom she is believed to be married to. Facebook images suggest they have two children together.

She was also 
arrested earlier this year in her home town of Norwalk after 
prescription pills were found in her car after a minor accident. 
Neighbors say the married mother-of-two then went into rehab.
