Hundreds of headteachers stepped into the row over GCSE grades yesterday demanding a 'total re-mark' of all English papers taken by their students this year.

The move comes amid growing optimism within the teaching profession that thousands of pupils will, in the end, be awarded higher grades in English than those they were awarded on Thursday, amid claims they were unfairly marked down.

One of Michael Gove's favourite headteachers, Joan McVittie, who is the outgoing president of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said she had been contacted by more than 100 secondary heads in recent days.

They said they were so furious they were now demanding re-marks of all English papers.

Headteacher Joan Mcvittie who teaches at the White Hart Lane School in Tottenham, London, said she has heard from more than 100 headteachers who demand a total re-mark of English exams

Glenys Stacey, the chief regulator of Ofqual, wrote to head teachers to say that there were 'questions about how grade boundaries were set' in units

She told The Observer: 'The authorities will not be able to handle that.

'There is huge anger out there. The whole thing is so unfair on pupils whose lives will be affected by these results.'

Meanwhile Glenys Stacey, the chief 
regulator of Ofqual, wrote to head teachers to say that there were 
‘questions about how grade boundaries were set’ in units.

She promised to ‘look closely’ at the way candidates had been treated.

The move came after heads called on 
Education Secretary Michael Gove to set up an independent inquiry into 
this year’s GCSE results, which have seen the exam boards threatened 
with legal action.

Just 
63.9 per cent of pupils achieved grades of A* to C this year in English,
down 1.5 per cent on last year – meaning that 10,000 fewer students 
achieved the results required for A-level entry. 

It could also lead to hundreds more schools being put into ‘special measures’.

It
is the first time the A* to C measure has fallen since GCSEs were 
introduced  24 years ago.

Unions claim about 4,000 pupils expecting a C 
grade pass in English were downgraded to a D.

In her letter to the National 
Association of Head Teachers, Ms Stacey wrote: ‘We recognise the 
continuing concerns among students, parents and teachers about this 
year’s GCSE English results.

We
will look closely at how the results were arrived at. We will do this 
quickly, but thoroughly, so that we ensure confidence is maintained in 
our examinations system.’

Ms Stacey said she expected to gather evidence over the next week and that Ofqual would then meet awarding bodies to discuss its findings.

A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ‘We welcome this move.’

The row comes as a leading head teacher argues in today’s Mail on Sunday that GCSEs should be scrapped.

Dr Martin Stephen describes the qualification as ‘rotten through and through’.

Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg also  welcomed Ofqual’s inquiry, adding: ‘The crucial test is whether it addresses the unfairness of similar work getting a C in January and a D in May.’
