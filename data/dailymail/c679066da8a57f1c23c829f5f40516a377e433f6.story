A family of five desperate to stay warm in the current cold snap accidentally burnt their house to the ground after leaving four stove top burners blazing.

Fire consumed the one-storey house on the Southwest side, Indianapolis, in the early hours of the morning causing $70,000 worth of damage, the Indianapolis Star reports.

The five members of the family all escaped unharmed with their pit bull, Sable, from the Kappes Street house but another mix-breed family dog, called Yoda, is still missing.

Fire officials believe it began because the family were using their stove burners in a bid to stay warm.

Firefighters reminded members of the public that cooking equipment shouldnâ€™t be used in an attempt to heat property.

A fire was also reported on Belmar Avenue where another family of five watched their home go up in flames.

They had light a fire in a wood burning fireplace and firefighters believe a gap in the metal firebox let embers spread into the wall.
