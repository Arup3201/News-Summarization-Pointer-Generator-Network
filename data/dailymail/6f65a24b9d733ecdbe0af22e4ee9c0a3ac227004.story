A rare fish, which inspired stories of sea monsters, has died after becoming beached in Mexico, just days after the rare species was videoed swimming by onlookers.

A giant 15 foot oarfish was spotted swimming in shallow waters in the crystal waters in the Sea of Cortez, in the Baja California area in the west of the country.

Tour guides from company Un-Cruise adventures were then able to get up close to the creature and record it gliding through the turquoise water.

The stunning fish is said to have inspired tales of sea monsters because of its impressive size

But less than 48 hours after the sightings the fish became beached on nearby Isla San Francisco and died.

The expedition leader said they believed the fish had become worn out. He said the fish was then attacked by scavenging birds.

Regalecus glesne, is the world’s longest bony fish and can grow up to 56ft (17metres) long.

The
 oarfish is seldom seen by humans as it typically lives between 650ft 
and 3,000ft (198 metres and 914 metres) below the waves.

The one spotted in the Sea of Cortez, Mexico measured around 15ft (4.5metres) long.

When
 the creatures swim into shallow waters they tend to die soon afterwards
 as they only expose themselves in such a way when they are injured or 
dying.

The fish’s dorsal fin runs the entire length of its body, which one researcher has claimed can give off electric shocks.

Oarfish can be found in almost all temperate and tropical oceans but are rarely seen.

They are thought to be the ‘sea serpents’ described in old stories.

The rare fish, which is seldom seen by humans, has an incredibly long, undulating body.

The Oarfish,
 Regalecus glesne, is world’s longest bony fish but evidence of its existence deep beneath the waves is only known thanks to a handful 
of videos and drawings, as well as specimens of the dead creatures that 
have washed up on beaches over the years.

While the animal is not the largest 
specimen to be seen, there is little video footage available for living 
oarfish for scientists to study, as the creatures typically live between
 650ft and 3,000ft (198 metres and 914 metres) below the waves where 
there is little light.

Oarfish can grow up to 56ft (17 metres) long and have a distinctive dorsal fin that sticks up out of the water in the video.

Lia Stamatiou, expedition leader for Un-Cruise Adventures said: 'I learned about the oarfish as one of those fish you study but never see.

'Seeing it swim up to us on the beach I was completely stunned.

'It was one of the most surprising and beautiful animals I had ever seen, with fantastic iridescent blue skin and a vibrant red dorsal fin.

'The fish resisted attempts by our crew to orient and push it off the beach.

Oarfish are more commonly found in open water at depths of up to 3,000ft, and can grow up to 36ft in length.

Most are observed dying or dead onshore and little is definitively known about their ecology.

Historians believe oarfish sightings may be responsible for stories of sea serpents in maritime folklore.

In awe: Oarfish, Regalecus glesne (pictured) are the world's longest bony fish but evidence of their existence deep beneath the waves is only known about by a handful of videos and specimens of the dead creatures that have washed up on beaches over the years

Like a fish out of water: A video has surfaced of a 15ft (4.5metre) long oarfish, swimming effortlessly in the shallows of Mexico's Sea of Cortez crystal clear waters - far from its usual environment of deep waters thousands of metres below the waves. The video was taken by guests and crew from Un-Cruise adventures

The creature’s swimming action sees 
it rhythmically undulating smoothly and historians think that the animal
 is probably the source of stories about sea serpents.

Its dorsal fin begins just above the creature’s small eyes in a reddish crest and runs the entire length of its body.

Researchers from New Zealand have claimed that it can give off electric shocks when touched.

Oarfish can be found in most of the world’s temperate and tropical oceans, but are hardly ever seen.

They eat plankton and tiny shrimp, jellyfish and crustaceans and are themselves hunted by large oceanic carnivores.

'The fish resisted attempts by our crew to orient and push it off the beach,' the tour guide said

A charter tour boat, as pictured here, spotted the fish swimming in shallow waters

The video, which was taken by tour company Un-Cruise, shows a 15ft long oarfish swimming in shallow water close to humans in a kayak (pictured). The fish are seldom seen by humans

Stuff of legend: The creature's swimming action sees it rhythmically undulating smoothly and historians think that the animal might be the source of stories about sea serpents. This image  of 'a great sea serpent' looks like an oarfish and was found in Hungary Bay, Bermuda centuries ago
