A Sydney fisherman has filmed himself in a titanic battle with a human-sized yellowfin tuna he landed in stormy weather  off the coast of Sydney.

Battling torrential rain and two-metre swells, experienced angler Josh Stuckey caught the 76kg fish after it latched onto a rod specially rigged-up for the one-man fishing expedition 40km off Sydney's coastline.

After initially planning to 'call it a day' after an uneventful Saturday morning on the water, Mr Stuckey headed for home before his prized-catch, a caught hold.

Josh Stuckey was fishing 50km off the coast of Sydney when the Tuna took hold

The experienced angler battled the tuna for more than an hour in rough seas

Navigating  through 'torrential rain' in his 4.5 metre runabout, Mr Stuckey filmed himself reeling the fish in with a GoPro camera mounted to the front of the boat at Browns Mountain - a section of sea popular with game fisherman.

The daring angler wrote in a fishing blog he was 'about to call it a day' when a mate called him over to a spot where he was having more luck.

En-route to the new location, Mr Stuckey suddenly leapt to his feet when he heard the line to one of his eight rods start spinning ferociously.

He wrote how he had 'happily been chugging along, through a couple of torrential downpours' before his luck turned.

Preparing for what would eventually be a one-hour wrestle, Mr Stuckey de-rigged the remaining tackle on board to give him more room to manoeuvre around the boat. 

He filmed the whole ordeal on camera which showed just how much of a fight the tuna gave him before he finally brought it to the side of the boat. 

After bringing it to the boat he battled to haul it aboard and used various solo fishing techniques

Mr Stuckey was holding on to a large hook attached to the tuna's mouth when he brought it in

'Just as stuffed as the fish:' He used every once of strength to haul it on deck

It was at this point he  declared in the Fishing World blog that he was 'just as stuffed as the fish' and admitted that he almost lost it when he took a rest.

'The fish was stuffed and didn't do a great deal and so I tried to skulldrag the fish up and over the gunwale,' he wrote. 

'Just as stuffed as the fish' Mr Stuckey admitted he almost lost the prized-catch when he sat back down and dropped it overboard, because he didn't 'quite have the huff 'n' puff left in me to go the extra yards.'

'I got the head and shoulders up and over the height of the gunwale but I was just as stuffed as the fish and didn't quite have the huff 'n' puff left in me to go the extra yards.' 

'Reluctantly I dropped the tuna back to the water back to the water and made a couple more attempts without success,' he wrote.'

The whole episode was filmed with a GoPro mounted to the front of the boat 

He said he  waited for a decent swell to come up which helped him heave it on board

When he finally secured it with some rope and a ski hook, his only move was to then reef it over the side without managing to hook himself in the had. 

'I took a moment to catch my breath, dropped the tail rope off the ski hook and drew the fish's head up to the gunwale.'

'I just waited for a decent swell to come up and heaved on the fish, getting him half up and over the gunwale and reefed back and the fish came spearing into the boat.'

'He said I was pumped,' before sitting on the boat's floor to reflect on his monster catch.

'I sat there on the floor for a moment before moving the fish around and getting some GoPro footage holding the fish up.

'This is the downside of fishing solo, no one to get good quality pics while the fish is still lit up and looking its best,' he wrote.

On his way home he took the fish to be weighed at a station near Watsons Bay, in Sydney's east, where it was gutted, and shared between two of his friends.
