The father of an Ohio soldier who was kidnapped in Iraq ten years ago and later killed has urged an Iraqi judge to fully prosecute the man accused of taking his son’s life.

Keith Maupin, 63, of Cincinnati, took part in a video teleconference from the Pentagon in the case of a man in Iraqi custody, whom U.S. officials say confessed to the killing of Sgt. Matt Maupin.

The 20-year-old soldier was kidnapped when insurgents with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms ambushed his fuel convoy near Baghdad in 2004.

Answers: Keith Maupin, who refused to shave while his son was still missing, wants to know why Matt was killed

At the time, video of the young Maupin was released showing him sitting on the floor surrounded by masked gunmen.

The soldier's family held hope he was still alive, but his remains were later found in a shallow grave near Baghdad in 2008.

On Tuesday, the initial hearing in the case was closed to reporters.

Mr Maupin, who refused to shave for more than four years as he waited for news of his son's fate, said he appeared by videoconference and spoke via translator to the Iraqi judge, who asked to hear statements from the family.

Afterwards he said he came away from the hearing feeling confident that justice will be served.

The judge did not indicate how he might rule or when he might rule, but that the man will be punished if found guilty, according to Mr Maupin.

A week ago, Mr Maupin revealed he did not know whether he would have the chance to speak to the suspected killer – but in the end, the man in Iraqi custody was not present at the hearing.

‘I made it clear to the judge that I feel this guy needs to be held accountable under Iraqi law,’ Mr Maupin said after the hearing.

‘If Matt's death can benefit the Iraqi people by ensuring a strong justice system, it will be worth it even though he is gone.’

According to Iraqi authorities, the man is Iraqi and initially confessed to Matt Maupin's killing in 2009, when he was tried and sentenced to death.

Never forget: Matt's parents founded the Yellow Ribbon Support Center, which delivers care packages above to the forces, to help other soldiers and keep their son's memory alive

But, he is now being retried due to problems in the initial paperwork.

For years Mr Maupin and ex-wife Carolyn had held on to hope that their son would be returned alive, after he was ambushed by insurgents in April 2004.

His captors released a video showing the young man surrounded by armed insurgents as he sat on the ground.

A few months later another video, appearing to show him being killed, was released.

Finally, in March 2008, the Army contacted Sergeant Maupin's parents to say that remains had been found and that DNA analysis showed they belonged to their son.

In April 2008, the family were told that two of the kidnappers had been sentenced to death, and that at least six Iraqis were believed to have been involved.
