Student India Barnes, 21, began 
pulling her hair at the age of eleven and by the time she was sixteen 
had just under half an inch of hair left at the front of her hairline.

Now in her second year of a dance degree at Chester University, India still does not know what caused her to start pulling. 

India's compulsion began between the ages of eleven and twelve, despite 
being happy at home and at school.

When India Barnes was 16 (left) she had just half an inch of hair left at her hairline, but now is undergoing CBT, and at 21, (right) wears a hair piece and is trying to get to the bottom of why she pulls her hair

‘As
 a teenager, dance took over my life,’ India says, ‘and I never pulled 
when I was dancing. The problem was I pulled so much hair when I wasn’t 
practising that it became increasingly difficult to hide what I was 
doing despite wearing my hair up, tightly scraped back, covered with a 
head band at the front and with a massive flower balanced on top of my 
bun – in all, managing to look like a textbook off-duty ballet dancer 
despite the damage I was doing. I think people just accepted it was my 
look.’

She
 has now started a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) course, where her 
therapist is currently helping her to explore what sparks the desire
 to pull.

And India is not alone. Three per cent of the population will suffer at 
some point in their lives from trichotillomania, the compulsive urge to pull out one's own hair, yet the vast 
majority of us have never even heard of it, partly due to its secretive 
nature.

To raise 
awareness of trichotillomania (TTM), hair loss specialist Lucinda Ellery
 has teamed up with charity Trichotillomania Learning Centre (TLC) and 
launched National No-Pulling Week.

The majority of TTM pullers do so to help them cope with anxiety and other difficult emotions. It is often sub-conscious act, which makes it even harder to stop.

And what can start as a relatively harmless habit can escalate into a compulsion, resulting in a complete loss of hair.

And it’s not just hair that sufferers pull at. The control impulse disorder can take many forms, including eyelash plucking, skin picking and nail biting. Sufferers not only have to bear the physical consequences of pulling, but the emotional side too, which often results in cripplingly low self-esteem.

 - 110 million people suffer from TTM worldwide

- 840,000 women in UK suffer from TTM

- Less than 10% of women seek treatment

- The majority of TTM sufferers (80%) pull hair

- 47% pull their eyelashes, 44% eyebrows and 24% other hair

- Half report pulling is worse when under stress

Sam Faiers, star of the hit UK TV series, The Only Way Is Essex, and Olivia Munn, US actress and star of The Newsroom have both admitted to pulling at their eyelashes.

In 2012 Sam told The Sun: 'It is hard to explain. I do it without thinking. I do it when I am nervous or bored or even when I am asleep. I don’t even realise I am doing it.'

Natalie Blyth, 32, a nurse from Kent, now wears a wig to cover the bald patch caused by her hair pulling, which began as a harmless hair twiddling habit.

It all started during a stressful time at school when she was around 14 years old..

‘I felt I had a lot of pressure to do well, and it was during this time I noticed I started to play with my hair a lot, twisting it round my fingers to help deal with any feelings of anxiety I had,' Natalie explains.

‘After some time, my habit moved on from twiddling my hair, and I started to pull. This began with one hair here and there, but gradually over time my pulling was getting out of control.

‘I knew what I was doing was wrong but it made me feel so relaxed that I couldn't stop. It got to a point I was pulling my hair out so much that I even made my head bleed’ Natalie says.

She lost her early twenties to the condition as ittook hold of her life and she hid herself away, often spending time alone in her room and crying herself to sleep every night.

Her TTM caused Natalie to loose her sense of identity and femininity, which led to her spiralling into depression.

‘I used to be really ashamed of what I did and was too scared to tell anyone. My mum used to find large clumps of hair all over the floor and I had to pretend that it was from my brush.

‘I would cry myself to sleep every night I lost all my confidence and I stopped going out. I felt like I had no life.

‘I used to think to myself why am I doing this, I must be some kind of freak. I thought to myself why should I be upset? I did this to myself. Nobody else was to blame’ she explains.

Natalie says that in 2004 she reached rock bottom and decided to take charge of her condition, visiting TTM specialist Lucinda who fitted her with her signature Intralace system which is attached to the head and the hair is weaved through the colour blended lace to look as natural as possible.

Lucinda says of the condition: 'So many young women are affected by TTM – but no one talks about it. By showing how common it is reaches out to women suffering out there.

‘I have thousands and thousands of TTM clients spanning across my UK and LA studios and the aim for International No-Pulling Week has always been to help raise awareness and offer solutions for sufferers. I want to stop women feeling alone.’
