A pregnant woman saved her mother's life by standing up to her abusive boyfriend when he was in the middle of battering her with a statue of an elephant.

Megan Gleaves, 20, bravely confronted 34-year-old drug user Darren Doran when she was woken up by the sound of him attacking her mother, Fiona Stagg, 39.

Doran, Miss Stagg's boyfriend of seven months, launched the unprovoked attack at their home in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, on 28 January this year.

He left his victim lying in a pool of blood with a fractured skull - and her injuries could have been much worse had Ms Gleaves not intervened at the crucial moment.

Doran was later convicted of wounding with intent, and is serving a six-year prison sentence.

Miss Stagg has now spoken about the attack for the first time since the trial in July, in the hope of empowering other domestic violence victims. 

She said: 'If it wasn't for Megan stepping in and confronting him I wouldn't be here today. She saved my life that night.'

Doran fled after Ms Gleaves intervened, leaving her free to call an ambulance for her seriously wounded mother.

The pair met in 2013 while both were being treated at a mental health unit in Furness General Hospital, Cumbria.

Miss Stagg said the beginning of a relationship was a 'whirlwind romance', but Doran soon began taking her money, disappearing for days - and had even hit her before.

Miss Stagg said: 'When he first hit me, earlier in the relationship, I blamed myself, I shouldn't have but I did.

'He was a drug user and suffered with mental health issues so I always felt like his carer.

'I would give him money for the gas and electric bills and he would disappear for three days, taking legal highs and drinking alcohol.

'When he would return he would be on a comedown and would take it out on me.'

During the trial, at Preston Crown Court, it emerged that Doran has 75 previous offences, including assaulting a previous partner.

Miss Stagg added: 'Domestic violence comes in many shapes and sizes and if my pictures can end up helping one person in getting out then it's worth it.

'Domestic violence can be physical, it can be psychological and it can happen to anyone, women or men. 

'The abuse has made me a nervous wreck, I struggle to leave the house as I have panic attacks just going to the shops.

'My memory isn't very good since he hit me with the ornament and I can't taste or smell anything.

'Megan and her boyfriend live with me and they give me the courage to carry on. If it wasn't for those two I wouldn't be able to carry on.

'At the moment I am focusing on getting everything that's negative out of my life.'

Detective Constable Dan Chadwick, of South Cumbria Public Protection Unit, led an investigation into the attack.

He said: 'I am pleased that Doran has been punished for his actions. Domestic violence will not be tolerated in Cumbria - no one should have to live in fear in their own homes.

'I would encourage anyone who has any concerns to get in touch; all reports will be dealt with sensitively and professionally.'

Rebecca Rawlings, centre manager at Women's Community Matters in Barrow, said: 'To be hurt in this way by the person you love and the person you believe loves you is terrible.

'This lady has been very brave to share her story and I hope it encourages other women in abusive relationships to seek help.'
