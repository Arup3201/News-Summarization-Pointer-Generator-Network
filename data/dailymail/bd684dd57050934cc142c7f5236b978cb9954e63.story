Never-before-seen interviews with First World War soldiers revealing the true horror of going 'over the top' in battle are to be shown on television for the first time.

In the heart-wrenching footage the former soldiers tell the true story of life in the trenches, and the emotions that went through the minds of the young men who gave their all in the deadly conflict.

In one poignant clip, to be shown on the BBC as part of a series of programmes commemorating the Great War, one unnamed German veteran asks: 'What was it, that we soldiers stabbed each other, strangled each other, went for each other, like mad dogs?'

Poignant: In one never-before-seen interview to be screened on the BBC this former British soldier reveals the 'terror' of the First World War

Questioning: In another clip, to be shown on BBC2's My Great War a German veteran asks what made soldiers fight 'like mad dogs'?

Another British soldier remarks: 'As soon as you get over the top, fear has left you and it's terror.'

The
 powerful interviews were filmed back in 1964, but were left on the 
cutting-room floor when producers of the classic 1960s series The Great 
War decided to focus on the history of the conflict.

Instead, the hours of unseen interviews 
with war veterans, stored on the original film reels, have been kept in the vaults of 
the Imperial War Museum for 50 years.

They
 are now set to be broadcast for the first time in BBC2's My Great 
War - which aims to show the personal experiences of those involved in 
battle, taking in everyday life in the trenches, dog fights in the air, 
fraternising with the enemy and even the actual experience of killing.

Website: The BBC will create a 'digital cenotaph' online to commemorate the First World War

A selection of the original recordings, in their entirety, will also be made permanently available to view on the BBC iPlayer.

My Great War is one of 130 programmes to be shown between next years and 2018 as part of a huge project to mark the centenary of the First World War.

As part of the four-year series the BBC aims to create a ‘digital cenotaph’ to honour the sacrifices made between 1914 and 1918.

By
 collecting nearly 1,500 family stories, photos and trench diaries on 
its website, the corporation said it wanted to create a ‘living memorial’
 to the fallen as part of a four-year project to mark the anniversary.

Between
 next year and 2018, the BBC will show more than 2,500 hours of TV and 
radio programmes dedicated to the war - including more than 130 new 
dramas, history documentaries and music shows.

Lord
 Hall – whose grandfather fought in the trenches as a private in the 
Liverpool Scottish regiment – said the commemorations would ‘inspire a 
new generation to understand what happened’.

He
 added: ‘I see 2014 as a chance for us all to learn something new about a
 war we think we maybe know very well, or to engage people who have not 
thought about World War I.’

The
 online archive – to be collated on the BBC website – will allow readers
 to find Great War stories from every part of the UK.

The BBC’s head of history 
commissioning Martin Davidson said: ‘All you’ll need to do will be to 
enter your location to unlock local first world war stories in the form 
of two minute audio clips. It is our ambition to turn it into a living 
memorial.

Britain's Great War: The BBC's First World War series will begin with the four-part series on BBC1 hosted by Jeremy Paxman

‘It has been 
designed to allow a new generation to understand the sacrifices made on 
its behalf by one that went long before. We hope that together with our 
audiences and our users we will create nothing less than a digital 
cenotaph.’

The First World War season – billed as the biggest in the corporation’s history –  will begin with a four-part BBC1 series Britain’s Great War hosted by Jeremy Paxman.

Last week, the Newsnight host criticised Prime Minister David Cameron for comparing next year’s commemorations to the Diamond Jubilee, describing him as ‘cloth-eared’.

On BBC2, rival historical heavyweights Sir Max Hastings and Niall Ferguson will be pitted against each other in rival documentaries.

Each will present a competing account of how the war started, with Sir Max defending Britain’s decision to fight and Professor Ferguson arguing we were wrong to get involved.

Another BBC2 documentary Gallipoli will feature an interview with media mogul Rupert Murdoch, discussing his father’s role in exposing the disastrous campaign.

Lord Hall also unveiled a series of new First World War dramas yesterday.

On BBC1, The Ark will star Charlie Chaplin’s great-granddaughter Oona as a nurse in a front-line field hospital.

And Radio 4 will host a four-year drama series Home Front, exploring the fortunes of those who remained in Britain over 600 episodes.

Lord Hall said: ‘Every one of us lives in a world which is profoundly shaped by those events, or have family that was touched by the Great War. It changed the face of our communities, our country and our world forever, and we’ll be telling that story over the next four years, right across the BBC.
