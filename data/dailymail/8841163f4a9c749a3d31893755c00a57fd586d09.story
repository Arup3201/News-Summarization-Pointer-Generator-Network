An examination table used by Dr Harold Shipman, Britain's worst ever serial killer, went up for sale on eBay for £10,000.

The macabre item was used by Shipman while he was a GP at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in Todmorden, West Yorkshire in the 1970s, during which time he murdered dozens of his elderly patients.

The padded blue medical table was listed on the auction website on Friday where it has already attracted two offers.

Its current owner Marjorie Chakravarti, 72, bought it in the early 1990s when she was senior nurse at the hospital where Shipman first worked as a GP, and began his murderous career.

He is believed to have murdered up to 260 of his patients during a 27-year period stretching from 1971. He preyed on the vulnerable and his victims tended to be elderly women living alone.

Their ages ranged form 41 to 93 and the murders were mostly committed during home visits, usually with a lethal injection of the painkiller diamorphine.

She says she purchased it for around £10 from a colleague and kept it in a garden shed for years before deciding to sell it on eBay in a decluttering exercise.

The item was placed on eBay with a price tag of £10,000 which Mrs Chakravarti says might be ambitious but said she is 'high maintenance'.

She said she bought it to help her with diplomas she was studying for in physiology, massage and aromatherapy.

Shipman, who was based in Hyde from 1977, was investigated by police in 1998 and given 15 life sentences for murder according to police his death toll could have been as high as 215 patients.

There was shock at how a seemingly outwardly respectable GP responsible for more than 3,000 patients could kill mainly elderly patients so casually.

He hanged himself in 2004 at Wakefield high security jail and his death brought to an end one of the most dramatic chapters in British criminal history.

A two year inquiry was instituted four years earlier to investigate all deaths certified by Shipman as the medical profession struggled to come to terms with how such a killer could have operated with such apparent ease.

The table was used by Shipman 
while he was a GP at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in Todmorden, 
West Yorkshire, now a crumbling derelict building

Mrs Chakravarti, who lives in Huddersfield, said: "My husband is ill, I am down-sizing. I have three sheds filled with rubbish and my intention is to sell it.

'To buy one of these new would cost around £770 and that's without any history. It's in reasonable condition for its age, I think it dates from the 1940s or 50s.'

Asked who might want to buy such an item she replied: 'I haven't got a clue. Perhaps someone who might want to do a diploma like me and might want a couch.

'I never met him, [Shipman], he was part of the group's practice at that time and Dr Michael Grieve was the senior partner.

'I was horrified at what Shipman did, that someone in a caring position could have committed such crimes. It's gob-smacking what he did.'

She says she also bought a black chair which Shipman would have sat on but is not releasing that until she sees how much interest there is in the couch, the sale of which she admits might attract 'the ghoulish'.

But it's not the only Shipman-related item that was put on the auction site. Copies of victims' death certificates and witness statements were also listed.

Twisted GP Harold Shipman is the UK's most prolific convicted serial killer, having murdered up to 260 of his patients during a 27-year period stretching from 1971.

Shipman studied at the Leeds 
School of Medicine graduating in 1970. In 1974 he took his first position 
as a general practitioner at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in 
Todmorden, West Yorkshire.

In
 1975 he was caught forging prescriptions of pethidine, an opiate 
painkiller, for his own use and was fined £600, and ordered to attended a
 drug rehabilitation clinic.

It was while working as GP in Todmorden that he began his killing career. He preyed on the vulnerable and his victims tended to be elderly women living alone.

Their ages ranged form 41 to 93 and the murders were mostly committed during home visits, usually with a lethal injection of the painkiller diamorphine.

Some psychologists have linked his crimes to the death of his mother from lung cancer when he was 17.

Like Shipman's victims, she had morphine administered at home by a doctor, a process which the young Shipman would have witnessed.

In 2000, Shipman was given 15 life sentences after being found guilty of murdering 15 patients while working in Hyde, Greater Manchester.

Nine of these victims were exhumed and three other victims who were not in the court case also had their remains dug up.

An inquiry concluded he killed between 215 and 260 people over a 23-year period in Hyde and Todmorden, West Yorkshire.

Throughout his three month trial, Shipman never took responsibility for his crimes, nor gave any clues as to his motivations.

Four years later, at the age of 57, he killed himself in his cell in Wakefield Prison, hanging himself with his bedsheets.
