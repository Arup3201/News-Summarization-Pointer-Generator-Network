Rant: Megan Merkel, 23, was charged with driving while intoxicated near Perinton, New York

A driver who allegedly ran over a mother-of-two while driving drunk declared her innocence on Facebook today with a vulgar and expletive-ridden rant.

Megan Merkel, 23, was intoxicated behind the wheel of her car on Sunday morning at 7.45am when police said she hit Heather Boyum who was riding her bike.

Mrs Boyum, 40, was reportedly first struck by the motorcycle driven by Merkel's boyfriend Mark Scerbo before being run over by the woman in her car.

The high school biology teacher was left lying in the road in Perinton, New York by the pair who fled the scene.

Mrs Boyum later died in hospital. She leaves her husband Eric and two children Frazer, 7, and four-year-old Paige.

Merkel used her Facebook page today to lash out at 'haters', telling them to '*** a **** and choke on it'. 

Scerbo, 22, was charged with second-degree manslaughter.

He was being treated in hospital for 'serious injuries' where he was arraigned today.

Merkel was charged with driving while intoxicated but authorities said she may face additional charges.

Scerbo had only just been released from prison after previously being jailed for driving while intoxicated.

Police said that Scerbo and Merkel had been racing each other down the road and pulling stunts when the collision happened. The woman was arrested soon after leaving the scene of the accident.

Family and friends gathered at the home of the late Mrs Boyum today to remember her.

The Fairport High School science teacher was an avid athlete. She had just completed a Musselman competition made up of a 1.2-mile swim, 56-mile bicycle ride and 13.1-mile run.

Mrs Boyum's mother told the Democrat and Chronicle: 'The entire world would be a better place if there were more people in it like her.'

Her funeral will be held on Thursday at St John’s of Rochester church in Perinton.
