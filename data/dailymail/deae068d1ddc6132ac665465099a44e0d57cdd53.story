Sickening: Sales of the t-shirts have grown, despite the fact he was identified as one of Britain's worst sex criminals by a judge

Twisted fans of paedophile rock star Ian Watkins are still buying his Mega Lolz T-shirts just 24 hours after he was sentenced to 35 years in prison for depraved child sex crimes.

Watkins, who was yesterday beginning his lengthy jail term, used the slogan, to describe his horrific offences in a phone call he made from prison.

But the merchandise branded with the catchphrase was selling out online, despite his recent conviction for a string of sickening sex offences.

The infamous t-shirts were sold out on internet retailer Amazon yesterday - after going on sale just months 
before his arrest in December last year.

There was only on auction website eBay, selling for Â£15.20, while all sizes except large had been snapped up on rock merchandise website Grindstore.

The lead singer of the rock band made the phrase famous by selling t-shirts with the slang term - which means 'laugh out loud'.

Watkins, who studied graphic design before he began his music career, designed the clothing as well as the artwork and merchandise for his band.

In a phone call to a fan made from prison he said: 'I am going to put a statement out just to say it was Mega Lolz.

'I don't know what everyone is getting so freaked out about.'

The frontman, who has sold more than 3.5 million records, launched his own clothing line called Made In Hell in 2008.

At the time he said: 'Over the years, I've been approached by various people and companies about starting my own clothing line, and I've always said: "No".

'Do we really need another guy in a band selling crap t-shirts just to pump up his ego? It seemed a bit cliche.

'But I used to be a graphic designer and still do all the artwork for the band - album covers, single covers, merch, website and logos.

'So I had an idea. What if I did something with my designs to make these shirts more than just shirts - make them actual, special works of art.'

Convicted: Watkins was jailed for 35 years yesterday for sick child sex crimes

After Watkins was arrested, his Made in Hell clothing company began selling 'Not Guilty' t-shirts to loyal fans of the paedophile rock singer.

It sold out with fans saying they were going to wear the T-shirt to support the singer at his trial.

Watkins was jailed for 35 years after admitting sexually abusing two infants and attempting to rape an 11-month-old baby boy.

The two mothers who gave up their children for the rock star to abuse, named Woman A and Woman B to protect their children's identities, were jailed for 17 and 14 years.

Watkins has made Â£100,000 from music sales since being arrested for sick child sex offences last year. 

Artwork: The slogan became the band's catchphrase and was used in set designs and on merchandise

The depraved Lostprophets lead singer has been picking up cheques for his songs after his arrest led to a boost in his record sales.

Watkins has also been paid money every time broadcasters have used one of his tunes during TV and radio reports about his arrest and trial.

But during the BBC's report of his sentencing they showed a clip of the band performing with all the music cut out.
