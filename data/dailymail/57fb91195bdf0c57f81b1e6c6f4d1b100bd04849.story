Staring into the eyes of a nine-foot shark is a sight most swimmers hope they will never see.

But far from panicking, this fearless woman begins to dance with it.

This is shark conservationist Julie Andersen - who hopes her eye-opening interaction with the feared animals will highlight their plight across the world.

Losing herself: Conservationist Julie Andersen 'dances' with a nine-foot oceanic whitetip in the crystal-clear waters off Cat Island, in the Bahamas

Too close for comfort: She gets close enough to touch the enormous shark, which has a reputation for being a man-eater, something diver Julie refutes

Undeterred: The accomplished diver seems completely relaxed in the company of the enormous whitetip shark, which clearly is showing an interest in her

She said: 'It was the first time that I've been in the water with a shark and lost all perspective and just started dancing with this animal.

'None of it was architected, it just came so naturally, it was an incredible moment and something that I will always cherish.

'The shark just kept coming to me and rolling and doing these amazing things.

'It is one of the most magical, incredible experiences. It's something I encourage everyone to do.

'Get in the water, meet a shark, because I promise you, you meet a shark, you're not going to want to kill them and you are going to care that they are going extinct.'

Conservation: Ms Anderson regularly dives with sharks and offers course to help educate people about the threat to the species and how to protect them

Interacting: Far from panicking, the conservationist spins and ducks around the shark, which appeared to show some interest in her moves

One off: Although Ms Anderson said she dives with various types of sharks regularly, she said this was the first time she has launched into spontaneous dance

As the founder of the Shark Angels, a campaign group aimed at bringing awareness to the plight of the world's shark population, Julie has devoted her life to saving the animals from extinction.

They use education and advocacy programmes - such as grassroots outreach and creative media - to help inspire a global movement to save sharks and the oceans.

She has swam with many species that are considered dangerous, including hammerheads, tigers and even great whites.

She added: 'People are really surprised when they meet me because here is this little blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl that gets in the water regularly with sharks.

'They're even more surprised to find out I have all my fingers, all my toes and I am in one piece.'

Most people would think Ms Anderson was mad to come face to face with such an enormous predator, let alone to start dancing with it

Julie had her latest encounter with an oceanic whitetip off the coast of Cat Island in the Bahamas.

Despite its fierce, man-eater reputation, Julie had no qualms about sharing the open ocean with it.

She said: 'Oceanic whitetips have it incredibly hard. They are incredibly maligned because people think they are one of the world's most dangerous sharks.'

Julie hopes her unusual work will alter some outdated perceptions that sharks are mindless killers.

And with 73million sharks being killed every year, she has vowed to continue working tirelessly to halt the slaughter.

She added: 'Love them or hate them, we need sharks on this planet because they keep the ocean healthy - and the oceans keep us healthy. Our food, our weather, our air, even the removal of carbon dioxide, is governed by the oceans.

'So if sharks aren't in the oceans, then the oceans are sick - and that means we're sick.'

Ms Anderson hopes her work with the sharks and footage of her dancing with the whitetip will help alter people's perceptions of the giant predators
