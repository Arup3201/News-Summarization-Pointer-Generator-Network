British scientists have revealed how they reconstructed the face of one of Henry VIII’s elite archers who drowned when the Mary Rose sank in 1545.

The team from Swansea University worked with a Swedish expert, Oscar Nilsson, to reconstruct the face of the man.

They used 3D scanning and printing - as well as modern forensic techniques - to analyse several skulls recovered from the Mary Rose and make a replica of one.

Mr Nilsson then took over the reconstruction and built up the man’s face muscle by muscle.

From studying the face and skeleton, the team have established a number of things about the man.

They believe that he was an archer because his skeleton shows evidence of repetitive stress injuries from pulling a longbow.

They also believe that he was of high rank because he was found with an ivory armguard, a silver ring and a bag containing a pewter plate.

He was more than six feet tall and was in his 20s or 30s.

The work is part of a wider project involving Swansea University and the Mary Rose Trust. 

They started by studying the skulls that had been taken from the wreckage of the Mary Rose and deciding which one to reconstruct

They then scanned and analysed the skull before using 3D printing technology to create an exact replica of it. The reconstruction was then built up muscle by muscle

The researchers believe that the man (whose skull is shown as a 3D scan) was an archer who was six feet tall and in his 20s or 30s. They also think he was of high rank because he was found with valuable objects

When the warship was raised from the Solent in 1982, 92 fairly complete skeletons of the crew were recovered. 

Ten skulls were taken to Swansea University for analysis, including the skull of the man whose face has been reconstructed.

Nick Owen, a sport and exercise biomechanist at the College of Engineering, which has led the Swansea work on the project, said: ‘Archers were the only professional soldiers of their day. So it is very likely that this is the face of one of Henry VIII’s elite troops. 

‘What’s so exciting is that we can reveal the face of a man who has been hidden from history. We wouldn’t have portraits of him, as we do for wealthy and powerful people from the past – for example we’d already seen the face of Richard III on paintings before his remains were discovered.

‘This is a face of an ordinary man, albeit in a crack regiment, and he hasn’t been seen for almost 500 years. 

The researchers scanned the original skull using a 3D laser scanner - this gave an exact three-dimensional virtual replica. They then 'printed' an exact copy of the skull (pictured), using a 3D printer

‘Thanks to 21st century technology and expertise, we can bring him vividly back to life, and understand more about his world.’

Mr Owen explained the steps involved in producing the reconstruction: ‘The key objective was to produce a replica of the skull, but without damaging it.

‘First we scanned the original skull using a 3D laser scanner. This gave us an exact three-dimensional virtual replica of the skull. 

‘The computer image was then given to Swansea University’s ASTUTE group to “print” an exact copy of the skull, using a 3D printer. The group normally use this type of technology to develop rapid prototypes of new products for companies. Printing took 48 hours altogether. 

‘We then gave the 3D copy of the skull to Oscar Nilsson, an expert in facial reconstruction. Using his expertise in forensics, his knowledge of anatomy and tissue depth, and his artistic abilities, he was able to build up the face muscle by muscle.’

The reconstructed face, along with many other artefacts from the Mary Rose, is on display in the new Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth.

When the warship was raised from the Solent in 1982, 92 fairly complete skeletons of crew members were recovered. The team also studied these bones for clues about the ship's crew

The team also studied a longbow recovered from the ship - it is believed that this is the sort of weapon used by the reconstructed archer

The 16th-century warship Mary Rose has been undergoing a meticulous programme of conservation since it was lifted from the seabed more than 30 years ago.

Ever since the hull of Henry VIII's flagship was raised in October 1982, it has been constantly sprayed with millions of litres of water and wax chemicals to preserve it.

At first, the hull was sprayed with recycled, fresh water at a temperature of less than 5C (41F) to stop the wood drying out and to inhibit bacterial activity.

The hull had been preserved under the sea as it had been embedded in mud preventing bacteria and tides from eroding it.

In 1985, the ship was turned upright and titanium props were installed to support the internal structure and work was undertaken to remove as much sediment as possible.

From 1994, active conservation commenced with the spraying of Polyethylene Glycol (Peg), a water-soluble polymer which can penetrate deep into the wood and support the cell walls.

And just last month, on April 29, the Peg sprays were turned off and the hull will begin its final air-drying phase to remove 100 tonnes of water during the next four to five years.

Visitors to the new museum will be able to view the hull through windows into the airtight chamber as it undergoes this final stage of conservation.

The Mary Rose Museum has worked closely with the team behind the Swedish warship Vasa which has used a similar highly-sophisticated drying process.

Once drying is complete in 2017, the internal walls surrounding the hull will be removed and visitors will be able to see a completely unobstructed view of the hull.

Mark Jones, head of conservation at the Mary Rose Trust, said: 'The conservation of Henry VIII's warship Mary Rose has been one of the largest and most complex programmes of this type ever undertaken.

'It really will be a unique chance for visitors to see our dedicated team preserve such a treasured artefact as they can see through windows into the 'hotbox' containing the Mary Rose when the new museum opens.'
