This is the woman at the center of the Prince Andrew underage sex storm, as she tries to go about a normal life after creating a crisis for the British royal family.

Virginia Roberts was pictured on a family outing to McDonald's near her home in a small town in Colorado, where she is living with her husband and three young children.

The 30-year-old mother of three claims that she slept with the prince when she was 17 and a victim of his billionaire friend Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile.

Family outing: Virginia Roberts with one of her three children as they head for lunch at McDonald's near the Colorado home where they are now living. She alleges she had sex with Prince Andrew when underage

United: Virginia Roberts with her husband Robert Giuffre and two of their three children. She alleged in court papers filed after Christmas that she had sex with Prince Andrew three times, which he strongly denies 

Determined: Virginia Roberts issued a statement through her lawyers saying she would not be 'bullied' or kept silent. She has been accused of lying by Alan Dershowtiz, the Harvard law professor with whom she claims she was forced to have sex

Since filing the allegations at a court in Florida, Roberts has been with her family in Colorado.

She and Robert Giuffre, her husband of 13 years with whom she has three children, have rented a house in the countryside on the outskirts of a small town close to Colorado Springs.

They have maintained a low profile and her mother Lynn and stepfather Stan Miller live nearby. None have commented.

Neighbors were unaware of the family's presence in the Rocky Mountain town.

One said: 'I heard about it on the news. And then I saw the girl - Miss Roberts - who lives down the track, I couldn't believe it.' 

 Roberts is now involved in an increasingly complex legal case - and has been branded a liar by one of America's most renowned lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, who she also alleges had sex with her while she was underage.

The extraordinary allegations made by Roberts are part of a US civil case against Epstein, who served 13 months in jail in 2008 for soliciting an underage girl for prostitution.

Roberts claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 - a minor under US law - and was employed as a 'sex slave' by Epstein. They were introduced, she claims, through Ghislaine Maxwell.Epstein's friend. 

The fifth in line to the throne slept with Miss Roberts at an orgy with other under-age girls on Epstein's private Caribbean island, as well as in a private house in London and in Epstein's New York mansion, according to the court papers. The claims are denied by Prince Andrew.

Meeting: This picture was taken when Prince Andrew met Roberts with his friend Ghislaine Maxwell (right) in early 2001. At the time she was 17, underage in Florida, and being paid by the Prince's friend, billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, for sexual services. The Prince denies any wrongdoing

Controversy: Prince Andrew, pictured here in Verbier, Switzerland, has been linked with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and accused of having sex with Virginia Roberts when she was a minor

Miss Roberts previously expressed her disgust at a photograph which showed the royal and Epstein walking together in Central Park after the disgraced tycoon had served just 13 months in jail

Public: Roberts disclosed her ordeal at Epstein's hands in 2011, when she lived in Australia. She has since returned to America and also accused Prince Andrew of underage sex

Roberts claims she was made to perform sex acts on Epstein.

She also claimed that the first time she met Prince Andrew was at Maxwell's home in London, where she was flown at the request of Epstein.

One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew's first encounter with the girl in March 2001 shows the Prince with his arm around her waist as Maxwell looks on.

Describing what happened, Roberts said Epstein invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip in 2001. They flew to Paris, then Spain, then Tangier and finally, they went to London. 

'After we landed, we drove straight to Ghislaine's Maxwell's house' and 'was given a small upstairs bedroom,' Virginia said.

She said: 'The following morning, Ghislaine came in. She was chirpy and jumped on the bed saying, 'Get up, sleepyhead. You've got a big day. We've got to go shopping. You need a dress as you're going to dance with a Prince tonight.'

She said I needed to be 'smiley' and bubbly because he was the Queen's son.

'Ghislaine and I went to Burberry, where she bought me a £5,000 bag, and to a few other designer stores where we bought a couple of dresses, a pair of embroidered jeans and a pink singlet, perfume and make-up,' she said.

'We got back to Ghislaine's house at around 4pm and I ran straight upstairs to shower and dress.

'When I went downstairs, Ghislaine and Jeffrey were in the lounge. There was a knock at the door. Ghislaine led Andrew in and we kissed each other on the cheek. 

'Ghislaine served tea from a porcelain pot and biscuits. She knew Sarah Ferguson and they talked fondly about Andrew's daughters.

'Then Ghislaine asked Andrew how old he thought I was and he guessed 17'.

The four of them went out to dinner and on to Tramp nightclub where, she says, Andrew danced with her.

'After about an hour-and-a-half, we drove back to Ghislaine's. All of us went upstairs and I asked Jeffrey to snap a picture of me with the Prince. I wanted something to show my Mom. Ghislaine and Jeffrey left us after that, and later Andrew left.' 

Epstein was convicted in a plea bargain deal of one count of soliciting underage prostitution and is now a registered level one  sex offender after serving an 18-month prison sentence.

But the scandal re-emerged as Roberts added her name to a case trying to overturn Epstein's plea bargain.

Wedding: Virginia Roberts married Australian Robert Giuffre just ten days after meeting him in Thailand in 2002

As 'Jane Doe 3' she alleged that she had been used for sex by Epstein and pressured into sleeping with both the Prince and  Dershowitz.

He categorically denies wrongdoing On Monday Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', filed defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on Brad Edwards' Paul Cassell's - her lawyers - public statements about the case and he urged Prince Andrew to do the same.

In a sworn statement in a Florida federal court, he denied he had sex with an underage girl on Epstein's private plane and island. Buckingham Palace has also denied the allegations against Prince Andrew.

Dershowitz said the woman's claims against him are 'totally false and made up' and he is 'completely and absolutely' innocent.

He said: 'I don't even know who she is,' he said of the woman. 'I've never seen her. I've never met her. I don't know who she is.'

Dershowitz pointed out that the woman claims they had sex on Epstein's Caribbean Island and at his New Mexico ranch, but Dershowitz said he had only ever been there briefly with his wife and daughter and was 'never out of the sight of my wife'.

He added that the woman has also accused him of having sex with her while they were on Epstein's planes, but claims he was never on those flights.

Two lawyers representing Virginia Roberts (pictured here with her husband Robert Giuffre) who claims to have had sex while a minor with prominent U.S.criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz, filed a counter-defamation lawsuit against him

Outing: Other than this family trip to McDonald's, Virginia Roberts has voided appearing in public since filing the explosive claims against the prince and Alan Dershowitz, which both deny

Dershowitz called for the two men to be disbarred for their 'unethical' practice.

'They will rue the day they filed this,' he said. 'They will not get away with this. There will be legal proceedings. The truth will come out and... these two unethical attorneys will be disbarred.'

They are no counter-suing him. In their lawsuit, Cassell and Edwards said Dershowitz defamed them when he accused them of 'deliberate misconduct and unethical behavior warranting disbarment' during several interviews with U.S. and international media outlets.

Cassell and Edwards said Dershowitz made defamatory statements in 'reckless disregard' in order to support his claim of innocence.

'I'm thrilled that they sued me, because this gives me an opportunity to depose them and prove beyond any doubt that they concocted the entire story out of whole cloth and that they did not do a proper investigation and that they have falsely accused me,' Dershowitz said on Tuesday.

On Monday Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', filed defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on Cassell and Edwards' public statements about the case and he urged Prince Andrew to do the same

Lawyers: Dershowitz slammed his accuser's lawyers, Brad Edwards (left) and Paul Cassell (right), for naming him in the lawsuit. He claims that they failed to carry out proper investigations - which they have denied

Dershowitz said in Monday's filing that the allegation against him was a 'deliberate lie.' He said that while he had flown on Epstein's plane several times, Roberts, named in court papers as Jane Doe #3, was not on any of those trips.

He also said he had been to Epstein's island once, for a day, and was with his wife and daughter the whole time.

Also on Monday, Dershowitz filed a motion in federal court to enter in a lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by his accuser and other women who say Epstein sexually abused them.

The women say the government's 2008 plea deal with Epstein, which allowed him to serve jail time on state charges but avoid federal prosecution, violated their rights.

Dershowitz, a Harvard University professor emeritus, represented Epstein against the sex crime charges, for which Epstein served a 13-month sentence after pleading guilty in 2008.
