Elle Kaye is unusual even within the world of taxidermy, perhaps not only because she is a young attractive woman, but because she chooses to eat the animals she works with before stuffing them.

The 22-year-old, from Hertfordshire, makes bespoke designs from roadkill or animals that have died through other means, and attempts to eat as much as possible of an animal, as long as the meat is fresh enough.

The former art student, who studied fine art at Loughborough University, says this decision is based on wanting to recycle and minimise waste, and happily tucks in to a diet more akin to that of a medieval lord than a modern woman.

While she creates stunning designs herself and on commission- from imposing peacocks to mouse ornaments and bird based fashion pieces- Elle also teaches taxidermy classes

Speaking to the MailOnline Elle explains: ‘For me it is a lifestyle choice.

Doing what I do ensures I recycle a deceased animal, as a meat eater, there is no logic in wasting perfectly edible meat.

‘It is important to me, because it upholds all of the notions that underpin taxidermy, and it means that I do the animal justice in recycling all of it.’

With pheasant, rabbit, wood pigeon, squirrel, and deer all regularly on the menu and her workbench, Elle is unsurprisingly regularly the target of hate and abuse from people who disagree with her practice.

She has received abuse online with people saying she deserves to ‘go to hell’ and threatening to ‘cut her up’.

But despite this, Elle has not been deterred from her passion.

‘I am lucky to have a close network of people around me who support what I do, which has helped to give me the confidence to excel in what I do and push myself.

‘I have had animal rights activists, vegans, vets and animal lovers take my classes and they have all been really complimentary about the steps I take to ensure the most virtuous and human preservation is being carried out.’

But Elle is keen to point out she is extremely conscious of ethics when it comes to her work.

Speaking to the MailOnline Elle says: ‘Taxidermy combines my interests in biology, animal science and conservation. It allows me to experience the fascination of animal biology, whilst also providing me with the opportunity to preserve animals for educational study. Giving animals new life is an immense privilege to me.

The high level of skill, effort and time required for each of Elle's pieces means they can cost hundreds of pounds

‘I will never harm an animal for the purpose of my work. I have many connections to farmers and aviculturists across the country that control pests and livestock on their land.

‘I have no intervention in the way that these animals are controlled, and am simply a vehicle of alternative disposal for their owners and keepers.

‘I also take pride in working with road kill, or animals that I find deceased in wooded areas where I live. I keep a paper trail to log the properties of every animal that I find, and acquire all the correct licenses when appropriate.’

While she creates stunning designs herself and on commission- from imposing peacocks to mouse ornaments and bird based fashion pieces- she also teaches taxidermy classes.

Run in London and from an Essex farm house, these sessions allow anyone to learn how to properly prepare and stuff a mouse for £60.

But for those who don’t quite trust themselves, Elle will preserve and pose nearly any animal you desire, with beloved deceased pets a common commission.

However, commemorating Fido in this way does not come cheap.

The high level of skill, effort and time required means a dog costs £980 while a cat will set you back £800 and a hamster or guinea pig £160.
