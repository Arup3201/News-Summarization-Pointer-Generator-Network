One of Leonardo da Vinci's masterpieces, drawn in the early 1500s and thought to be a self-portrait, is in extremely poor condition and continues to deteriorate each day.

The artwork, drawn in red chalk, has been exposed to humidity over the centuries and has yellowed, but thanks to breakthrough technology there is new hope for halting its degradation.

Scientists have developed a new approach to identify the culprit of the yellowing without interfering with the original drawing and the knowledge gleaned could be used to preserve and save the precious self- portrait.

Look carefully: A chalk drawing by Leonardo Da Vinci which is thought to be a self-portrait has suffered considerable discolouration because of humid storage conditions over the centuries. Now scientists have developed a new approach to identify the culprit of the yellowing without interfering with the original drawing, and this knowledge could be used to preserve and save the precious portrait

Centuries of storage in humid conditions has led to widespread yellowing and browning of the paper, which is reducing the contrast between the colours of chalk and paper, diminishing the visibility of the drawing.

Experts in paper degradation from Italy and Poland were tasked with determining whether the destructive process has now slowed after conservation measures have been taken, or if the ageing process is continuing and could threaten the survival of the drawing.

To do this, they developed an approach to non-destructively identify and quantify the concentration of light-absorbing molecules known as chromophores in ancient paper, which are responsible for the ‘yellowing’ of the cellulose within ancient documents and works of art.

‘During the centuries, the combined actions of light, heat, moisture, metallic and acidic impurities and pollutant gases modify the white colour of ancient paper's main component: cellulose,’ Joanna Łojewska, a professor in the Department of Chemistry at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland explained.

‘This phenomenon is known as “yellowing,” which causes severe damage and negatively affects the aesthetic enjoyment of ancient art works on paper.’

Chromophores are key to understanding the visual degradation process because they are among the chemical products developed by oxidation during ageing and are behind the ‘yellowing’ within cellulose.

Yellowing occurs when ‘chromophores within cellulose absorb the violet and blue range of visible light and largely scatter the yellow and red portions, resulting in the characteristic yellow-brown hue,’ said Olivia Pulci, a professor in the Physics Department at the University of Rome Tor Vergata.

The experts can now identify and quantify the concentration of chromophores within paper to determine the degradation rate of the paper.

Their new technique involves obtaining ‘optical reflectance spectra’  - the measure of the proportion of light or other radiation striking a surface which is reflected off it - of paper samples in the near-infrared, visible and near-ultraviolet wavelength ranges.

Using the data, they calculated what sort of light is absorbed by the cellulose fibres in the paper. They then applied computer simulations based on quantum mechanics to calculate the light absorbtion spectrum of chromophores in cellulose.

Adriano Mosca Conte, a researcher at the University of Rome Tor Vergata said: ‘Using our approach, we were able to evaluate the state of degradation of Leonardo da Vinci's self-portrait and other paper specimens from ancient books dating from the 15th century.’

‘By comparing the results of ancient papers with those of artificially aged samples, we gained significant insights into the environmental conditions in which Leonardo da Vinci's self-portrait was stored during its lifetime.’

The new technique involves calculating what sort of light is absorbed by cellulose fibres in paper. This data is then applied in computer simulations based on quantum mechanics to calculate the light absorption spectrum of chromophores in cellulose. IT could be used to prevent the decay of old books (pictured) and other drawings

Mauro Missori, a researcher at the Institute for Complex Systems in Rome, said explained that the type of chromophores present in Leonardo's self-portrait are ‘similar to those found in ancient and modern paper samples aged in extremely humid conditions or within a closed environment, which agrees with its documented history’.

One of the most significant implications of their work is that the state of degradation of ancient paper can be measured and quantified by evaluation of the concentrations of chromophores in cellulose fibres.

Dr Conte said: ‘The periodic repetition of our approach is fundamental to establishing the formation rate of chromophores within the self-portrait. Now our approach can serve as a precious tool to preserve and save not only this invaluable work of art, but others as well.’

A British chemistry teacher has explained the distinctive scent of antique books.

Old books have a sweet smell with notes of vanilla flowers and almonds, caused by the breakdown of chemical compounds in the paper, while new books smell like they do because of chemicals used in their manufacture.

The anonymous blogger said the chemical breakdown of compounds within paper leads to the production of ‘old book smell’.

Paper contains cellulose and small amounts of lignin - a complex polymer of aromatic alcohols – and finer papers contain less lignin than cheaper material like newsprint.

Lignin is what makes paper yellow with age because oxidation reactions cause it to break down into acids, which then help break down cellulose, he explained in the Compound Interest blog.

The smell of old books comes from chemical degradation and a number of compounds have been pinpointed.

Benzaldehyde adds an almond-like scent, vanillin smells of vanilla and ethyl hexanol has a ‘slightly floral’ scent. Ethyl benzene and toluene, which are also produced give off sweet odours.

These volatile organic compounds are created by reactions known as ‘acid hydrolysis’ and together make up the smell of old books along with other alcohols produced by the reactions.
