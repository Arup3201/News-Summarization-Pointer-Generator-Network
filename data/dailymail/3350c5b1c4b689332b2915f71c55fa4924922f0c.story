A crackdown to prevent British jihadis fighting in Iraq and Syria from bringing bloodshed to Britain’s streets was in disarray last night.

David Cameron yesterday said it ‘sticks in the craw’ that fanatics can go abroad, pledge allegiance to the Islamic State and still expect to be free to return to the UK.

But, despite it being heavily trailed over the weekend, there was no firm commitment to new legislation to bar them from coming back.

Clash: David Cameron's plans to hamper jihadis' free movement could be blocked by Nick Clegg

The Prime Minister said he was ‘clear in principle’ that a ‘targeted discretionary power’ was required – but cross-party talks were needed to see if it was workable and legal.

Dominic Grieve, the ex-Tory attorney general, last night claimed such a move was ‘probably impossible’ and many Liberal Democrats are fiercely opposed.

There was also confusion over an apparently firm commitment by Mr Cameron to reinstate powers that allow terror suspects living in the UK to be relocated away from other extremists, or placed in ‘internal exile’.

Within hours of the move being announced to MPs, sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that he had only agreed to ‘look at’ the idea of exiling terror suspects to other parts of the country – and may yet block them.

A senior Lib Dem source said: ‘Frankly, we are going to take a lot of convincing before we sign up to any new legislation in this area.

Obstacle: The Prime Minister will have to get his plans for a crackdown approved in cross-party talks

‘It would be a huge step for the state to forcibly remove someone from their friends and family, and possibly job, and put them in another part of the country when they had not been tried or convicted of a crime.’

It was an intervention by Mr Clegg that forced relocation to be scrapped three years ago, as part of the axing of control orders.

In a statement to the Commons yesterday, three days after the terror threat to the UK was raised from ‘substantial to severe’, Mr Cameron struck a determined tone.

‘Adhering to British values is not an option or a choice,’ he said. 

‘It is a duty for all those who live in these islands so we will stand up for our values, we will in the end defeat this extremism and we will secure our way of life for generations to come.’

A British woman is among seven suspected UK jihadis caught by Turkish border guards trying to cross into Syria.

The woman and two British men were stopped near Reyhanli, one of a network of Turkish frontier towns dubbed the ‘gateway to jihad’. They were questioned but were not arrested and are therefore free to try again, intelligence officials said last night.

Four British men, aged 20 to 35, carrying 2,000 US dollars (around £1,200) were stopped recently near the town and were also released.

Turkish authorities have struggled to stop foreign suspected jihadis, since many enter Turkey with a 90-day visa and are therefore not committing an offence. Intelligence officers warn there has been an alarming increase in the number of British ‘volunteers’ travelling to join IS.

Up to 20 Britons are believed to be in safe houses waiting to cross over into Syria, including several women, who are playing an increasingly prominent role in IS.

But it later emerged that he had not secured agreement with his junior Coalition partner on all the measures announced.

Those that do have support include legislation to give the police statutory powers to confiscate the passports of suspect terrorists at UK borders as they try to leave the country. 

Airlines will also be forced to hand over advance passenger information to the security services or be banned from landing their planes in the UK.

But, despite a weekend of intense talks between Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg, aides made it clear there were key areas where no deal had been reached.

Action: Cameron told MPs he would look 'very favourably' on a request for arms from the Kurdish forces

These included the power to stop British-born citizens who have been fighting abroad from returning to the UK, potentially rendering them temporarily stateless.

Mr Cameron told MPs it was ‘abhorrent’ that British-born jihadis who hated Britain should be allowed to come back.

‘It absolutely sticks in the craw that someone can go from this country to Syria, declare jihad, make all sorts of plans to start doing us damage and then contemplate returning to Britain having declared their allegiance to another state,’ he said.

But what will emerge from the ‘cross-party talks’ is far from clear.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘The Prime Minister’s proposals on British citizens returning are very unclear and confusing. It isn’t clear what they want to do, how it would work in practice, what it means for citizenship or how it would comply with international law.’

Prevent British jihadis from returning to the UK

Having been heavily-trailed over the weekend as a firm proposal to strip British nationals of their passport, potentially rendering them stateless, it was yesterday downgraded to an idea the Government supports in ‘principle’.

Government lawyers, Lib Dems and ex-Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve warn that it will breach the UK’s international obligations and possibly common law.

Details yesterday were worryingly vague, and it will now be subject to ‘cross-party talks’ – which many suspect is the equivalent of kicking it into the long grass.

Failure to take decisive action will infuriate the public – and many Tory MPs – who say anybody who has declared allegiance to the Islamic State should lose their rights to return.

Extend Tpims so terror suspects can be relocated away from their home

The power, part of the old control order regime, was widely used by security officials to split up groups of fanatics living in the UK and make them easier to monitor.

To appease Nick Clegg, it was axed when Tpims (terrorism prevention investigation measures) were introduced three years ago. Since then, two terror suspects subject to Tpims have absconded – including Al-Shabaab extremist Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, who escaped from a London mosque dressed in a burka. MI5 will welcome the return of this disruption tactic, but last night it was mired in confusion with the Lib Dems insisting they have not yet ‘signed-off’ on the idea.

Force returning jihadis to undergo a de-radicalisation programme

This is intended to answer critics who claim the Government’s anti-extremist Prevent programme is an expensive failure.

However, the new law will apply only to suspects who are placed under a Tpim rather than every returning fighter. Currently, there is not a single person under a Tpim.

They have proved less popular with police and security services than control orders. At least 250 fanatics are already suspected of having returned to the UK from Syria and Iraq.

Give police new powers to confiscate the passports of terror suspects

The Home Secretary can already use the royal prerogative to remove the passports of people suspected of travelling overseas to engage in terrorism. The new measure extends the power to police, who will be given temporary permission to withhold a travel document at UK borders while further checks are carried out. It is intended to close a loophole where police think suspects are acting suspiciously at the borders, but do not have enough evidence to prevent them boarding a flight.

Significantly, Mr Cameron also promised to overturn any court ruling that declares the use of the royal prerogative illegal – suggesting a damaging human rights judgment is imminent.

Ban airlines from landing in the UK unless they give passenger details

This addresses a problem under which six European airlines in countries with strict privacy laws refuse to give advance passenger details to the Government’s controversial eBorders scheme so a passenger can be checked against terror watchlists.

A new piece of stand-alone legislation is expected shortly. It would allow non-UK citizens to be banned from boarding a flight and allow British nationals to be put under close surveillance when they return.
