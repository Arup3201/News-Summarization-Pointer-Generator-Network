A massive surge in immigration is driving the need for at least 42,000 new homes a year to be built in London, a report warned yesterday.

A damning dossier accused London Mayor Boris Johnson of ‘entirely misrepresenting’ the reason for the capital’s relentlessly rising population – a trend which will lead to unprecedented housing development.

But a predicted increase of a million foreigners over the next 15 years must be matched by the same number of  Londoners being ‘driven’ out of the metropolis, or the ambitious target will be doomed to failure because there will still be too few homes, it warned.

Migrationwatch UK, the immigration think-tank which published the report, said it was ‘sheer nonsense’ for the Greater London Authority’s to claim that the predicted population boom would be caused by natural growth from the city’s ‘youthful population’.

Between 1991 and 2011, the UK-born population of London was static at 5.2million while foreign-born residents doubled to 3million – a total population of around 8.2million.

It is projected to increase to 10million by 2029, overwhelmingly driven by the arrival of 1.1million immigrants and births to existing and future foreign families, says the report.

In 2012, only one-third of births were to parents who were both UK-born, it said.

Migrationwatch UK said this would place further huge demand on the city’s housing stock, which is already struggling to cope with its rapidly swelling population.

Housing supply has not kept pace with the number of residents living in London meaning waiting lists for social housing have doubled since 2000, private rents soared to more than £1,400 a month and property prices soared to an average price of £514,000 – around nine-times median earnings.

Critics have recently said the cost of buying or renting a property in the capital is being pushed ‘beyond the boundary’ of what is affordable.

To tackle the problem, Mr Johnson has pledged to double the number of homes being built to 42,000, by freeing up brownfield sites, converting existing properties into flats or building on the green belt.

But in its 20-page report, ‘The Demand For Housing In London’, Migrationwatch UK said the target was ‘optimistic’.

Achieving this number was dependent on around 1million Londoners leaving the capital for other parts of the country.

Many are middle-class families who are pushed out because they cannot afford a house in London and can find cheaper homes in other places with better schools, hospitals and transport, and less crime.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migrationwatch UK, said: ‘London’s huge population increase in the last two decades has been driven solely by immigration and the same will apply over the next 15 years.

‘City Hall has been less than frank about what is going on. The general public have no idea of the extent to which immigration is driving the city’s housing crisis and causing Londoners to leave.

‘The business lobby seem to have a lofty disregard for the lives of ordinary Londoners. It is ludicrous for them to suggest that London needs immigrants on anything like the present scale.

‘The inevitable effect is massive pressure on schools and hospitals and, especially, on housing. London needs skilled migration, not mass migration.’

He added: ‘Those who promote the idea of an international city effectively free of constraints on immigration seem to be blind to the implications for the existing population of London.

‘They should be clear that the result will be more Londoners forced to leave the city and find somewhere else to live. Are they content with that outcome?’

Concerns about the impact of migration have increased since Tony Blair introduced an effectively open-door immigration policy after the 1997 election, affecting the social make-up of cities, unemployment and pressure on housing and services.

Net migration remains stubbornly high at more than 200,000 a year, mainly due to EU immigration. Critics have warned it means David Cameron's promise to reduce net migration to tens of thousands, the levels of the 1990s, will be virtually impossible to achieve.

In a joint statement, Labour MP Frank Field and Tory grandee Sir Nicholas Soames MP, who co-chair the cross-party group Balanced Migration, said: ‘Just as the Scottish referendum has blown open the British constitution, so has this latest report on housing needs blown open the debate on immigration. The report shows London’s housing stock is creaking.’
