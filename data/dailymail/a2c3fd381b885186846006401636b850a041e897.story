A conservative Jewish university in the heart of New York is in uproar after one of the school’s four student newspapers published a first-hand account of an Orthodox woman’s one-night stand.

In reaction to the piece, the student council of Yeshiva University pulled funding from The Beacon after the online paper refused to remove it from its website, sparking a campus-wide debate on censorship.

The column, called How Do I Even Begin To Explain This, was written by an anonymous 20-year-old Orthodox modern Jewish woman who writes in detail about her one-time Manhattan dalliance

In the essay, the woman describes her thoughts and feelings as she transforms herself from a self-described ‘Occasionally-Cute-Modern-Orthodox-Girl’ into a ‘Sexually-Appealing-Secular-Woman.’

‘Between the fumbling, the pain, the pleasure, I convince myself that I’ve learned to make love,’ the woman wrote.

By the end of the column, she expressed regret at the hotel tryst. ‘I made a stupid mistake,’ she wrote. ‘The only thing I learn is how to do the walk of shame the day after.’

According to the Wall Street Journal, The Beacon’s website received more than 41,000 hits by Thursday night, 15,000 of those honing in on the anonymous woman’s story.

The Beacon co-editors Simi Lampert and Toviah Moldwin met Wednesday with three Yeshiva administrators, as well as the president and secretary of student affairs.

Ms Lampert told Fox News that the administrators asked them to remove the column, or at least ‘change some of the wording in it.’

Neither option was acceptable to the editor.

‘They were offering compromises and we didn’t want to make those compromises,’ she said. ‘We then said we didn’t want to be an official publication of YU.’

YU then announced it was removing its funding of the paper.

‘After an amicable discussion between the two sides, The Beacon decided to part ways and become an independent publication,’ associate director of media relations Matt Yaniv said.

The paper received $500 in funding last semester.

A message on the YU Beacon’s website says: ‘In light of recent developments, YU and The Beacon have agreed to separate. Over the next few days, we will update the site to reflect these changes. The Beacon will continue to publish as always.’

Orthodox Jewish law prohibits premarital sex. Yeshiva University is based on the ideals of Torah U’madda, a branch of modern Orthodox Judaism that acknowledges the merit of both religious and secular studies, a difficult line to walk for some students.

The university is split into two separate campuses. Stern College in Midtown Manhattan houses the women of YU, while the men attend class about 150 blocks away.

Students took to Facebook to debate the article and the nature of censorship. One student, 21-year-old Elan Kirshenbaum, said the article contributed to ‘a sense of moral degradation.

He said it would have been more acceptable if the woman had written about the experience ‘in either a theoretical way or a less graphic way.’

Gavi Brown, 19, told the Journal that the article brought up some interesting points on the boundaries of Orthodox Judaism.

'We've kind of become used to the fact that things are going to be censored. I don’t think that’s okay. The basic notion of inhibiting students’ expression, however used to it we’ve become, I think it’s completely unacceptable.’

-Commentator editor Ben Abramowitz

‘I personally enjoyed the fact that it brought about a conversation,’ he said, adding that he heard one rabbi on campus call it ‘literally pornography.’

Another student newspaper published a report Thursday saying YU intends to install an Internet filter – primarily in men's dorms in an effort to block pornography.

School officials acknowledged a plan was underway after initially denying it.

‘We’ve kind of become used to the fact that things are going to be censored,’ Commentator editor Ben Abramowitz, 22, said.

‘I don’t think that’s okay. The basic notion of inhibiting students’ expression, however used to it we’ve become, I think it’s completely unacceptable.’

Though he called The Beacon’s essay ‘cliché,’ he said the newspaper still had a right to run it.
