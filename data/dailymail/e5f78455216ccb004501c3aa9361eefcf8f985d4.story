A professional footballer attacked a former teammate after he saw him helping his wife get a taxi home.

Dennis Wyness, 36, and childhood friend Martin Bavidge had enjoyed a night out before the assault.

Mr Bavidge, 32, had gone to the Babylon nightclub with the Elgin City striker and his wife Hazel after attending a fundraiser in Aberdeen on October 28 last year.

Wyness, of Westhill, Aberdeenshire, disappeared from the city centre club after his wife began dancing with other men.

Mr Bavidge became concerned about her as she was unsteady on her feet and offered to help her get a taxi home in the early hours of the morning.

But he was punched to the ground when former Aberdeen star Wyness spotted them on the street together a short distance away from the nightclub.

Wyness admitted a charge of assault when he appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday.

Fiscal depute Lorna McLafferty said: 'The complainer was a semi-professional footballer with Peterhead Football Club.

'The accused was known to him as a childhood friend and former teammate at Peterhead Football Club.'

Miss McLafferty told the court that Mr Bavidge had been on the way to a taxi rank with Mrs Wyness when he was attacked by her husband.

She said he had tried to contact Wyness on his mobile phone after leaving the  Babylon nightclub but had not been able to get through.

He then called in the help of a friend, Robin Ritchie, with whom he had been out earlier that evening, to help him get Mrs Wyness home.

Mr Ritchie arrived at the scene and spotted Wyness walking towards them on the city's Union Street.

Miss McLafferty said: 'The accused continued to walk past all the witnesses and raised the middle finger of his right hand at them. On seeing this, Mr Bavidge approached the accused and asked him what was wrong.

'Mr Bavidge and the accused were facing each other.

'Mr Ritchie saw Mr Bavidge make a motion with his  shoulder as if the accused had struck out and Mr Bavidge was observed falling backwards on the ground, striking his head on the pavement.'

The court heard that Wyness had then 'casually' walked away, leaving his friend bleeding and unconscious on the ground.

He was taken to hospital with head injuries and received five stitches to the back of his head. Doctors noted he had a blood clot on the inside of his cheek, which he is believed to have bitten as he fell.

Punched: Former teammate Martin Bavidge in action for Peterhead

When police officers went to the family home the following day, Mrs Wyness told them she had been intoxicated and had not seen anything happening.

Her husband later went to police and made a full and frank confession.

Miss McLafferty said: 'The accused admitted that he had punched Mr Bavidge once on the face due to being angry about contact Mr Bavidge was having with Mrs Wyness.

'He stated that he had not realised Mr Bavidge was seriously injured.'

Sentence was deferred until next month for background reports.

Outside court, defence  lawyer Charles Benzies said his client regretted what had happened. He added: 'Mr Wyness wants to apologise. He is 36 years old and has never been in trouble before.

'He hopes Mr Bavidge makes a full recovery and has no ill feelings towards him now.

'Mr Bavidge has been back playing football and it hasn't affected his career.'

Wyness started his career with Aberdeen in 1996 but went on loan to Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 1999.

He signed for Caley Thistle in 2000 and was the club's top scorer in 2000-01.

Wyness went on to play for Hearts, St Mirren, Queen of the South and Peterhead before moving to Elgin City last year.
