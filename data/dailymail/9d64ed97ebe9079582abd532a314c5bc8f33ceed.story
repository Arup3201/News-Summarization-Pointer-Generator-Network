With  Robin van Persie not due to return for Manchester United until next month, if ever there was a time for Radamel Falcao to prove his worth at Old Trafford then it is now. 

Unfortunately for manager Louis van Gaal it appears that Falcao’s surprise selection for United’s Under 21s in a 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Tuesday has done little to repair the shattered confidence that has characterised the 29-year-old’s loan spell. 

Van Gaal confirmed on Friday that Van Persie will not be fit until after the forthcoming international break and although he insisted his decision to play Falcao in the second string was not intended to humiliate the player, he hinted that the plan may not have worked.

6 - Louis van Gaal could oversee an unwanted milestone on Sunday, as Tottenham look to make it six games unbeaten against Manchester United. 

1921 - The last time Spurs managed this was a century ago, when they won four and drew two games either side of World War One, between February 1914 and October 1921. 

3 - If Spurs win it will be the first time they have had three consecutive victories at Old Trafford. 

1 - If Tottenham manage at least a draw, they will become the first team to go six games unbeaten against United in the Premier League era.

'People wrote that it was humiliation to play him in the second team. But a lot of players have played there this season. 

'So I don't think so. It just shows a professional attitude of the manager, the staff and the player.

'Victor Valdes also played and Rafael da Silva. Rafael played a very good match and scored a very good goal so he will now have a better grip on his confidence.

'That can happen to all the players playing in the second team. It's a lower level and they can play more than the 70 minutes they get in training.

'Falcao did not play his best match for the second team but he tried and he did his utmost best. 

'I can not ask for more from him. He has shown a professional attitude.

'We pay a lot of money for the players and so it is normal that they play football for us. Falcao has not reacted to this the way the media has reacted. That's the difference.'

More than seven months after signing the player, Van Gaal is still unable to fathom why he has been unable to replicate the stellar form he showed for Colombia, Porto and Atletico Madrid.

'You never can know that,' Van Gaal said when asked why things had not worked out for the 29-year-old, whom United have an option to buy for £43.2million at the end of the season.

'We are looking for the solution for him but you can never know that.

'You can give fantastic performances in another country but not in the country that you are present for.

'That is not the first example and it will not be the last example. A lot of players need more time to adapt to the new situation, new culture, higher rhythm of the English game and to a lot of aspects.'

The striker has spent plenty of time warming the bench at Old Trafford - including in their last two games

Falcao has started the last two games on the bench and Van Gaal does not appear to be in any kind of rush to recall the striker.

'In a club like Manchester United it is more difficult than in a minor club because here he has his competitors,' Van Gaal added.

'Now Wayne (Rooney) is playing there and Wayne is scoring so you always have to compare players with each other but you need also luck.

'He is doing his utmost best and shows a professional attitude, not only Falcao but all the other players, but you cannot always win.'

With Falcao only boasting four goals for United this season, Van Persie’s absence continues to hurt Van Gaal and his team. Asked about the Dutch striker’s possible return against Tottenham tomorrow, he said: ‘No, he is still with the medical department. He’s training inside, not outside on the pitch. It will be the other side of the international break.’ 

Van Gaal won a trophy in his first season at Ajax, Bayern Munich and Barcelona, but the chances of him doing so at United are remote.

The 2-1 defeat by Arsenal knocked United out of the FA Cup on Monday and in the league, Van Gaal's men are 10 points behind Chelsea, who have a match in hand. United are fourth in the standings, just one point ahead of Liverpool, with 10 matches left.

Van Gaal is sure his team's confidence has not been affected by the cup exit to the Gunners.

'I have the same confidence as before,' said Van Gaal, who has fixtures against Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool after Saturday's home game against Tottenham.

'We were very disappointed at the last game because the players had the feeling that we lost (because of) ourselves and not (because of) the opponent.

'But I am very pleased with the reaction from the players this week and I hope we can show that against Tottenham because it is the first of 10 matches we have to play in the rat race.'
