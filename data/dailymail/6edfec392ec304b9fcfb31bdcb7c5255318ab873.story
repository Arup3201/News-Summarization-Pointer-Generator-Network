Arbitrary: Some NHS Trusts are not performing cataract operations on sufferers if they don't consider their vision has deteriorated enough

Drastic restrictions on  eye operations imposed by  half of NHS trusts have put  thousands of patients at  risk of losing their sight, a report warns.

Elderly victims of the cutbacks are being left unable to read, write or drive as they wait longer for cataract surgery, it says.

Patients in their early-60s have been denied operations even though their job relies on them being able to drive or operate machinery, eye specialists add.

The damning report reveals the scandal of PCTs picking surgery for a  cataract – a clouding of the eye lens – as an ‘easy target’ to save money by increasing the threshold for vision loss before patients can have an operation, and also by increasing waiting times.

In some areas, ‘arbitrary’ restrictions mean they can have only one eye operated on. Some PCTs  have suspended surgery for weeks  at a time to claw back overspending at the end of a financial year, it  is claimed.

Official guidance from the Department of Health states patients should have surgery if the cataract affects sight, has an impact on quality of life, and if he or she understands the risks and agrees to it.

But the report for the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the Royal National Institute  of Blind People insists this is not happening routinely and many PCTs are implementing ‘visual acuity’ thresholds.

The research is based on Freedom of Information request results from 133 PCTs in England. Of these, 70 PCTs (53 per cent) are restricting access and have implemented the threshold for surgery on either the first or second eye. Meanwhile, 56 PCTs (42 per cent) allow surgery according to the guidelines or if clinicians deem it appropriate. In a further seven PCTs (5 per cent), the policy is under review or an updated one is being worked on.

Experts believe trusts restricting access are doing so without ‘robust evidence’ that this will not harm patients or increase inequalities.

Dennis Sleigh, 69, had a cataract removed in March but was told he cannot have his second eye done due to ‘PCT policy’.

The singer, songwriter and poet from Derby said: ‘This is impairing my independence. I feel frustrated and abandoned.’

Barbara McLaughlan, of the RNIB and author of the report, said the data suggested PCTs had picked on cataract operations as an ‘easy target’ where patients could be made to wait longer without harm.

‘Cataract surgery should be  performed when consultants  believe it is in the patients’ best interest,’ she said. ‘But some PCTs are forcing patients to live with unnecessary sight loss and a reduced quality of life.’

Larry Benjamin, chairman of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists’ cataract guideline committee, described the cutbacks as ‘a false economy’, adding: ‘This short-term saving could lead to older  people having other accidents,  potentially increasing NHS costs in the longer term.’

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘PCTs should ensure that in each case the clinical needs of each patient are taken into account and should not be introducing blanket bans on access to treatment.’

A cataract operation costs the NHS £932 for the first eye and £808 for the second. It is the most common surgical procedure in the UK, with 400,000 carried out each year.
