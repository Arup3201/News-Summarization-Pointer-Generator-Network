The friend of Prince Harry who organised his Kazakhstan skiing holiday with Cressida Bonas has denied suggestions it was a PR stunt.

Inge Solheim, a Norwegian former stockbroker, has described allegations that the four-day trip was a ploy to gain publicity for a country with a poor human rights record as ‘nonsense’.

He said his 'dear friend' Harry, 29, decided to go on the holiday on the spur of the moment and insisted suggestions to the contrary were ‘inaccurate, speculative and disappointing’.

Mr Solheim, 41, said the couple’s decision to go on the trip was ‘wholly innocent’.

He told the Telegraph: ‘Harry is a dear friend and if I can facilitate a visit during which he and Cressie can spend some time in private, as young lovers want to, it’s beautiful.’

Mr Solheim, who met Prince Harry on a 2011 expedition to the North Pole, flew with the couple and his wife, Anna, on the private jet of Turkish-born property developer Burak Oymen.

My Oymen, 40, who now lives in Monaco but has homes across the world, is understood to have sent his private plane to London to collect the four.

The son of a senior Turkish 
politician, he and his business partner, Serzhan Zhumashoc, who has 
close links with the controversial Kazakh ruler, President Nazarbayev, 
own the ski resort of Shymbulak where Harry stayed.

He recently said in an interview it was his intention to turn the resort into the ‘Courcheval of Kazakhstan’.

Amnesty International has questioned the Prince’s decision to visit Kazakhstan, a country accused to serious human rights violations.

Mr Solheim told the paper that while he had been planning the trip for some time, Harry’s involvement was a late arrangement.

He said Mr Oymen, a ‘very dear and close friend’, is already a very well-connected man and ‘so he isn’t trying to gain something from this'.

He told the paper: ‘The only reason Harry and Cressie came along was that I said I was going to Kazakhstan to chill out, and said to Harry, “Do you want to come along?”

‘Harry said that, yes, it would be a great way to chill for a short time. That’s all it was. I don’t care what anybody thinks. That was it.’

He defended Harry against allegations his visit was an endorsement of the Kazakhstan regime, although he added: ‘I don’t believe you are going to bring Kazakhstan up in the world by isolating its people.’

On suggestions the trip was a PR stunt, he said: ‘We managed to keep the visit secret for one and a half weeks but, of course, we were under no illusion that we could keep it secret for ever.’
