Assurance: Planning minister Nick Boles told Labrokes executives that local councils will not be able to block the development of their shops

Ministers have assured the country’s biggest bookmaker that they will clear the way for the opening of even more High Street betting shops.

The Government will prevent councils from using planning powers to stop gambling firms from crowding shopping districts with new betting outlets.

Betting shops have become hugely profitable thanks to the use of controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBT), which allow punters to spend up to £100 every 20 seconds.

There are now more than 33,000 in Britain.

The letter to the Ladbrokes firm from planning minister Nick Boles assured its executives that local authorities will not be allowed to use planning rules to stop the expansion of chains or block the development of clusters of shops.

It became public following a move by Liverpool council last week to ban the FOBT terminals and complaints by betting companies that other major authorities are delaying planning applications.

Possibilities for new expansion of betting chains were opened in the summer as part of a scheme to revitalise High Streets.

The scheme, drawn up on the basis of a report by television presenter Mary Portas, loosens planning regulations for a two-year period.

As a result retail shops can be switched to use as betting shops without needing planning approval from the council.

According to a letter from Ladbrokes to ministers, the company complained of the ‘unfortunate attitude’ of some councils and of town halls ‘placing whatever obstacles they can in the way.’

Mr Boles replied, in a letter released to Labour’s shadow local government minister Hilary Benn under Freedom of Information rules, that the Government regarded blocking manoeuvres by councils as ‘a problem’.

The planning minister told the gambling combine: ‘I do recognise this can be a significant problem and we are taking action to tackle it.’

The frustration of council attempts to stop new betting shops under planning rules follows the collapse of their efforts to use gambling law for the purpose.

Terminal velocity: Punters can lose £100 in 20 seconds at fixed-odds betting terminals - but there can only be four per outlet

Newham council lost a legal case after it withheld a licence from the Paddy Power chain which wanted to open another betting shop in an area which already had 81, with 18 on one street.

Thames Magistrates Court ruled that the firm was in line with the law and should get its licence.

Mr Benn told the Guardian newspaper: ‘David Cameron claimed that he would act to protect communities but these documents show that his ministers have been doing the opposite by making it more difficult for communities to stop the proliferation of betting shops and undermining the powers used by councils to force applicants for planning permission to explain the social impact of their changes.’

The Government did not deny the thrust of Mr Boles’ letter but said it was wrong to think the new planning rules had been influence by gambling companies.

A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: ‘The provisions in the Growth and Infrastructure Bill were announced to Parliament three months before the department received a letter from Ladbrokes.

'To suggest the Government was somehow influenced by the betting industry is simply ridiculous and untrue.’

Last month Culture Department ministers declined to order a reduction in the high stakes allowed on FOBT machines, saying that although the ‘potential for harm’ among players using fixed odds terminals was ‘high’, it was ‘not clear how great an impact a reduction would have on gambling-related harm’.

Big draw: Ladbrokes has said that FOBTs account for around 80 per cent of its turnover

Fixed-odds betting terminals arrived in Britain in 2001 and spread rapidly following Gordon Brown’s abolition of betting taxes and the 2005 Gambling Act.

Leading Labour figures have now indicated they regret the liberalising of gaming in their new law.

Councils warn that FOBTs are being clustered in low-income districts, where drug dealing is common and unemployed people, including youngsters, can be tempted to lose large sums of money very rapidly.

Each betting shop is allowed four FOBTs, so betting firms are anxious to open more shops to plant more machines in any lucrative district.

The gambling regulator, the Gambling Commission, has said each FOBT produced an average weekly profit of £825 last year, up from £760 in 2011.

Ladbrokes has said that £5.9billion was staked on its fixed-odds machines from January to June last year, compared with £1.2billion for its over-the-counter bets.

Campaigners say the high stakes and high speed of the machines should be limited by law, because they attract people with low incomes to risk poverty and debt, and contribute to street violence and drinking.

They are also said to be popular with drug dealers, who can stuff the machines with illicit money, make safe bets which ensure they lose only a small percentage, and then cash out.

As a result they get receipts which explain to police why they are walking around with large sums of cash.
