With their wide, springy gait, ostriches can reach speeds of 40mph (70 km/h), covering up to 16ft (5 metres) in a single stride.

As a child, Keahi Seymour was fascinated by what appeared to be the effortless speed and agility of these creatures, making them the fastest running birds on the planet.

Now the San Francisco-based inventor has created a prototype gadget that he claims will allow humans to experience what it’s like to reach these incredible speeds.

Dubbed the ‘Bionic Boot’, the shoes have springs on the back designed to imitate the Achilles tendon of an ostrich or kangaroo, giving the wearer more down force when running.

Mr Seymour has been working on the boots for several years, and has already produced dozens of prototypes.

Last month, he took his Bionic Boots to the Maker Faire in New York to demonstrate its capabilities.

In its current form, the device can reach speeds of up to 25 mph (40 km/h) – or the same speed as a slow-moving car.

Gone are the days of solid rubber prosthetics.

From 3D-printed limbs to titanium legs and hands controlled by apps, advances in technology are revolutionising the industry.

Earlier this year, a new state-of-the-art centre has opened in Scotland to give specialist treatment to military amputees - taking advantage of these developments, and making the technology more mainstream.

The service is based at the WestMARC unit at Southern General Hospital, and at the SMART Centre in Edinburgh.

Patients in Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee will be able to access services via video link-up.

The units will run alongside the existing NHS prosthetics service, and use specialist prosthetic training and imaging equipment to manufacture new socket technology.

The centre also features a gait laboratory that will study how well patients are walking with their new limbs.

According to PopSci, Mr Seymour says won’t rest until he can go faster and outrun some of Earth’s fastest land animals.

And he isn’t the first to attempt the gait of an ostrich or kangaroo. For instance the £166 ($265) bouncing boots claims to turn anyone into a human kangaroo.

The ‘Kangoo Jumps’ are fastened like roller blades or ski boots, with quick-release buckles.

Once they’re on, you need to do a little march on the spot to get yourself used to the sensation, which feels rather like jogging on a trampoline.

Featuring a spring-loaded sole, the mini-trampolines were initially invented to help people recover from sports injuries by taking away the impact of running on their joints.

But now they’re being sold as a way of enjoying all the benefits of a tough gym or aerobics workout.

The Kangoo Jumps were featured in the hit reality TV show Made In Chelsea when two of the glossy young stars, Binky Felstead and Cheska Hull, were filmed jogging in them beside the River Thames
