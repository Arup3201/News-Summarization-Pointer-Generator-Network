This is the first picture of the grandfather who poured beer over a crying toddler in a pub because he ‘just wanted the child to be quiet’.

Danny Polak, 64, lost his temper when a 15-month-old boy’s tears disturbed his lunch in the Ernehale pub in Arnold, Nottinghamshire.

He soaked the toddler in ale and then kicked the boy's mother, Rachel Atkin, in the backside when she went to confront him.

Anger: Grandfather Danny Polak, 64, poured ale over a crying child because the boy disturbed his lunch

Mr Polak was fined £355 and ordered to pay £50 in compensation, and admitted two counts of assault, when he appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Monday

Today Mr Polak apologised for his actions but said he had been treated too harshly.

‘I’m sorry about it. I had gone out for lunch and the baby was crying for a good 15 minutes. I just wanted them to be quiet,’ the grandfather said.

Miss Atkin, 25, had gone to the Ernehale with her son and sister-in-law, Rebecca White, on the afternoon of June 11 this year after a morning at a soft play centre.

After they took seats at a table next 
to Mr Polak and his wife, Miss Atkin went to order food at the bar, 
leaving Miss White to look after the child.

Assault: Danny Polak claims the child had been 'crying for 15 minutes' when he poured the beer over his head at the Ernehale pub

Catherine Picardo, prosecuting, said that the child: 'started to whine as though he was missing his mother.'

'The
 defendant, with a half-full pint in his hand, approached the table and 
poured it over the baby’s head, which caused him to scream.'

Ms
 Picardo told the court that, when confronted by Miss Atkin, Mr Polak 
told the mother: 'You shouldn’t bring kids in a pub,’ to which Miss 
Atkin responded by throwing her drink in his face, saying: 'See how you 
like it.'

The court heard that Miss Atkin then turned her back on Polak, who kicked her in the bottom and left the pub.

After the ruling on case, Mr Polak defended himself saying he did not intend to pour the beverage over the child’s head.

‘There was very little drink in the glass and I didn’t aim at the baby. I feel I have been treated very harshly. It has made my wife poorly.

‘I’ve not been back to the pub since.’

Miss Picardo said: 'It is quite shocking behaviour as it involved a 15-month old child.

'It took place in a family pub where children are entitled to be.'

Brawl: When the boy's mother Rebecca Atkin was alerted to Mr Polak's action she confronted him and threw her own drink in his face after which he kicked her in the backside

Maria Bines, defending, said: 'He was having a quite drink with his wife. He thought rather than go to the bar, the mother should have stayed to attend her son.

'He threw the beer in the general direction of the table where the females were sitting.

'He accepts that beer went over the baby and that his actions were reckless.

'He accepts he kicked her in the bottom. It wasn’t done in malice, it was just so he could have the last word.

'He accepts that what he did was wrong. He is not proud of what he has done, and accepts that it will have to be punished.'

Mr Polak, of Sherwood, Nottingham, told 
police that he had been angry because the noisy child had forced him and
 his wife to abandon plans to have lunch at the pub, which they only did
 once a month.

Guilty: Mr Polak, 64, admitted two counts of assault when he appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court

Speaking shortly after the incident, Miss Atkin said: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes. I was so shocked.

'I just stood there for a second and then I ran up to his table and shouted at him.

'I could hear my son crying when I was at the bar and my friend said he’d been shouting about it before he poured the drink over my son.

'But it’s no excuse to pour a drink on him, it just made him cry even more.

'It’s just scary to think someone would do that to a baby that is crying.'

After the case the boy’s father Tony White, 30, blasted the ‘very lenient’ sentence.

He said: ‘It’s not enough. All my son was doing was crying and this happened to him. It is a very lenient sentence.

‘It has really affected my partner. She won’t go to another pub as she’s worried it could happen again.

‘It has really shaken her up. That’s why I expected the punishment would have been more severe.’
