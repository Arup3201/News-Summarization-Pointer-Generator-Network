Bristol Palin, 23, bought a five-bedroom Arizona home with all cash just four years ago, but now she can't make a dollar.

The daughter of former Alaska governor and one-time Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin has filed paperwork to try and get child support payments dating back nearly two years from Levi Johnston, her former fiance and the father of her son Tripp, five. 

Bristol claims in the paperwork that her 2013 income was zero dollars, and so far in 2014 it's zero as well.

Bristol Palin, pictured here with her son Tripp, is fighting to get more money from her ex-fiance Levi Johnston. In the court documents Bristol reported her 2013 income was zero and she has also earned nothing this year

The court documents, which were obtained by Radar, show Bristol is asking Levi for child support payments of $1,750 a month, and she wants the money dating back to October 2012.

Since she shot to fame as the pregnant daughter of a Republican vice presidential ticket,  Palin has worked hard to cash in on her fame.

She has had lucrative deals with Candies, penned a 2011 memoir (with some help) called Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far, appeared on Dancing with the Stars in 2010, Dancing with the Stars All Stars in 2012, and she had her own reality show Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp which aired for one season on Lifetime in 2012 and was promptly cancelled. 

In December 2010 Bristol paid $172,000 cash for this five-bedroom Arizona home, pictured left, and she has twice appeared as a contestant on Dancing with the Stars. But now she makes nothing

In December 2010 she bought a home in Arizona, featured on her failed show, for $172,000 cash. She was the sole purchaser of the five-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath home which has a three-car garage.

The same month she bought her home she bankrolled surgery on her jaw, which she insisted was more than just for her appearance as it helped align her teeth, too.

While she has flamed out professional, it appears Levi has been making a regular income. After posing for Playgirl in 2009 and writing a tell-all a year later, Levi has gotten married, had a baby girl and gotten a job.

Johnston made $62,400 in 2014 and $39,067.25 the year before, according to the paperwork. His wages are currently being garnished 40% as he works to pay his outstanding bills. 

Then: Bristol shot to fame in 2008 when she was pregnant and her mother was nominated for VP. Here she and then-fiance Levi hold hands to meet the world at the Republican National Convention in September 2008

Now: Levi married Sunny in 2012. She is the mother of his second child, Breeze Beretta. Johnston has found employment and has already made  $62,000 this year. Their daughter's middle name is in honor of the gun

In an affidavit the 24-year-old said, who is fighting the payments, wrote, 'the amount is very taxing on my family.'

Bristol has custody of Tripp, while Levi lives with wife Sunny and their daughter Breeze Beretta, who was born in September 2012 shortly before her parents married.

Fortunately for Bristol her mother has made millions on books, speaking engagements and television appearances.
