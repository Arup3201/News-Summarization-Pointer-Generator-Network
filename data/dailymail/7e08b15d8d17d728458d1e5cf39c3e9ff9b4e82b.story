The secluded Anglesey farmhouse has been home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for three years

With a private beach and stunning views of Snowdonia, it is the four-bedroom Anglesey farmhouse where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent their first years of marriage.

As William and Kate prepare for the next stage of their lives, their love nest is incredibly back on the rental market.

Unsurprisingly, the owners expect to be inundated with offers to move in.

New tenants may even get to meet the couple, who reportedly love the cottage so much they plan to visit for holidays.

The unique offer comes after Prince William announced said last week he will quit full-time military service to spend time with his family.

He is due to move to apartments in Kensington Palace with Kate, George and their dog Lupo which have been restored at a cost to the public of £1million.

While William paid £750 per month for three years to rent the North Wales farmhouse while he served at RAF Valley, it is likely the rent will now rise substantially.

The farmhouse, which sleeps eight in four bedrooms, comes with access to
 a private beach and boasts breathtaking views of nearby Newborough 
Forest, Llanddwyn Island and Snowdonia.

Inside, there is a living room with an open fire, dining room with 
French doors, a Kitchen, utility room and cloakroom on the ground floor.

Upstairs, there are four twin bedrooms and two of these can be turned 
into doubles. One has an en suite bathroom with a toilet and another has
 an en-suite bathroom with a bath, shower cubicle and toilet.

Kate and William have been living at the farmhouse for the past three 
years, although more recently Carole Middleton joined them to help the 
duchess and the baby settle in.

The new housekeeper, Antonella Fresolone, who used to work for the Queen
 at Buckingham Palace, also travelled to Anglesey after George was born 
and cooked for the royal couple.

Until now, it was not permitted to report where it was – or even how many rooms it had – for security reasons.

Prince William served as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot at the base in Anglesey before announcing his retirement from service last week

The couple have been seen by locals speeding along country lanes on William’s red and white 180mph Ducati superbike.

One local publican said William and Kate were ‘just like any other young couple in love’.

He added: ‘He seems to enjoy our home-made burgers and chips. Kate prefers fish and salads.’

'Prince William usually drinks bitter, perhaps a pint or two, and Kate sticks to white wine and sparkling water,' he added.

Owned
 by Sir George Meyrick, one of the richest men in Wales, the farmhouse 
within land given to Sir Meyrick's ancestors by King Henry VII.

Prince George, born in July, has flown to Scotland with his royal parents to meet great-grandfather Prince Philip

Prince Philip has been introduced to his great-grandson, Prince George, for the first time since his birth in July.

The eight-week-old future king flew to Scotland on a private jet with his parents yesterday afternoon.

He was taken to Balmoral, the Queen’s private Highland estate, to meet the 92-year-old royal. Charles and Camilla are at their nearby home, Birkhall.

Philip was the only senior royal not to have met the third in line to the throne.

At the time of George’s birth he was recuperating at Sandringham after an abdominal operation. 

Now George is at Balmoral, there is a rare opportunity for a unique family photo to be taken.

For the first time in more than a century, three generations of heirs to the throne are alive: Prince Charles, 64, Prince William, 31, and newborn George.

The last time such a picture was taken was in 1894 when Queen Victoria was photographed with her son Edward VII, grandson George V and great grandson Edward VIII.

A royal insider said: ‘Everyone has been waiting for this photo to be taken, and of course the Duke of Edinburgh has been looking forward to seeing his great-grandson. 

It’s wonderful that the family have finally got together.’
