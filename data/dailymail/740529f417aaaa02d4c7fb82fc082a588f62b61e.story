Goalkeeper Joe Hart is likely to have been concentrating so hard while England were romping to a 5-0 victory in their Euro 2016 qualifier over San Marino at Wembley, he could have given himself a headache according to former number one Ray Clemence.

Manchester City stopper Hart was a virtual bystander as the Group E whipping boys were eventually well beaten by Roy Hodgson's men, making just one save and only touching the ball some 19 times.

Hart was cheekily voted man of the match by an online poll ran via England sponsor Vauxhall, although midfielder Jack Wilshere collected the post-match champagne having been finally confirmed by the stadium announcer following a telling pause.

Clemence is a former England coach and player, winning 61 caps in an eleven-year international career 

However, Clemence - who won 61 caps between 1972 and 1983 before later going on to work as a coach within the national team set-up - insists Hart's contribution should not be taken lightly despite a perceived lack of match action.

Clemence, who is ambassador for Prostate Cancer UK and is supporting the new Men United Sports Quiz, told Press Association Sport: 'Although Joe had nothing to do, it was still a big test for him because you have 50,000 people there and you still have to concentrate for 90 minutes knowing that you might only have one save to make.

'I have been in that situation many times with England and also with Liverpool.

'I used to get really bad headaches after a game just through concentrating, shutting everything else out to make sure that I was switched on if I had anything to do.'

Clemence, 66, continued: 'You try to shut everything else out and just play the game in front of you.

'You play behind the ball, wherever that ball is you adjust your position to be in the right position, so that if anything happens very quickly you are in the right position.

'You are not just stood watching it, you won't be moving around, so you are playing your own game behind the 10 outfield players.'

England's victory maintained their perfect start to Euro 2016 qualification, but Hodgson's men will face a much sterner test away to Estonia on Sunday.

Clemence - who played some 470 games for Liverpool, winning five championships and three European Cups, and then made more than 200 appearances for Tottenham - believes the current England squad have what it takes to make an impact should they as expected reach the finals in France.

'Obviously there was lots of youth on show at Wembley and there will also be I am sure against Estonia,' said Clemence, who successfully battled against prostate cancer in 2005, but has since been receiving treatment again after the disease returned.

'The great thing about this group is because its an easier group its going to give Roy a chance to bed some of the younger players in, for them to get experience that hopefully when we qualify, which we will do, then they are in a position to do us proud.'
