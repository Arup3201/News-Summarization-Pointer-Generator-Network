The cost to taxpayers of transporting Polish criminal suspects from Britain to face court in their home country has doubled in the past two years, it has emerged.

The secret extradition flights, dubbed Con 
Air, now take place on a weekly basis to remove hundreds of suspects who
have fled to the UK across open borders.

While Poland pays for the flights, the ‘hidden’ administration expenses for security and holding the fugitives for weeks as they are processed through UK courts is estimated to have cost the British taxpayer £50million last year, up from £25million two years previously.

Although some of the fugitives are wanted for serious offences, many have been extradited for motoring offences and minor crimes such as spraying graffiti or even stealing a chicken.

And many of those extradited are back in the UK within three days of being dealt with by a court.

In 2009, the extradition flights, which involve dozens of Polish police officers landing at a small airport near London as part of a massive security operation, were scheduled on a fortnightly basis.

New figures from the Polish authorities show they have now become weekly – with two flights having to be run during some weeks in ‘peak periods’ when there are more than 50 prisoners waiting to be extradited.

Back in Poland: Last year, a total of 986 suspects were flown to Poland on 65 flights. This was up slightly on the figures for 2010 and a huge leap from the figures for previous years

Critics say the cost to Britain of processing the fugitives is the latest problem with the European Arrest Warrant.

The cross-border crimefighting agreement was introduced in 2004 and states EU members must hand over people wanted in other EU countries with a ‘minimum of formalities’, in an effort to speed  up extradition. However it is argued it disproportionately costs Britain millions of pounds to enforce.

During the handovers, prisoners are led across a runway handcuffed, carrying their possessions in plastic bags before being strapped into the seats of the usually full 80-seater Polish military twin-propeller aircraft.

They are then shackled down inside before flying from Biggin Hill Airport in Kent – a former RAF commanding base during the Battle of Britain.

The airport closes to other business for the flights, which are not published on the usual schedules.

Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, hundreds facing court hearings have fled to seek refuge among Poles living in Britain. At first, they were sent home on commercial flights, but the huge cost led to Polish authorities using a military plane instead.

only a fine when sentenced

Patrick Mercer, chairman of  the House of Commons sub-committee on counter-terrorism, said: ‘The European Arrest Warrant is full of faults, but it was introduced for a sensible purpose.

‘It is mildly abused and the Government needs to tackle this and levy the whole cost against the warrant-issuing country rather than the British taxpayer.’

A senior police source told the Mail: ‘We’ve had requests to arrest people who are wanted for motoring offences and it’s cost a fortune on interpreters, transport and man hours processing them for the  flight only for them to return a few days later.

‘It’s insane that we’re wasting our time and resources processing these people for such trivial crimes. The Poles want all their offenders tracked down no matter what.’

Expensive: British officials have pleaded with Poland for a let-up in the extradition of those wanted for minor offences, but to no avail. Polish officials say they are constitutionally bound to find every offender.

A spokesman for the Polish interior ministry defended the flights, saying: ‘There is no other way.’

The Serious Organised Crime Agency, the body responsible for processing European Arrest Warrants in the UK, declined to comment.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We will always ensure that those who attempt to evade justice by crossing a border within the EU are quickly brought to justice. We will continue to press EU countries to consider proportionality when issuing European Arrest Warrants.’
