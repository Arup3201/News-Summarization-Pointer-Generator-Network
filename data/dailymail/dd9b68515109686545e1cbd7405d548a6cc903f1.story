Former Labour minister Denis MacShane is facing a fresh police investigation after he resigned as an MP yesterday for fiddling his expenses.

Scotland Yard last night vowed to examine a report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards which found Mr MacShane guilty of submitting 19 false claims ‘plainly intended to deceive’ Parliament’s expenses authority.

But he could still dodge criminal charges because evidence submitted to Parliament is inadmissible in court.

Former Europe Minister Denis MacShane today quit the Commons, hours after a parliamentary demanded he be suspended for a year for claims which were claims were 'plainly intended to deceive'

The former Europe Minister announced 
he was quitting after MPs on the Standards and Privileges Committee 
banned him from the Commons for a year for what they described as ‘the 
gravest’ breach of expenses they have seen.

Mr MacShane claimed thousands in 
travel expenses so he could jet around Europe and for consulting 
services using fake invoices from a front organisation that he had set 
up.

‘The bills were signed with a “nom de plume” purporting to come from
 a general manager who did not in fact exist,’ the MPs said.

The former MP for Rotherham also 
claimed thousands of pounds for computers and laptops, including one 
which he allowed an intern to keep after they stopped working for him.

The total Mr MacShane claimed on expenses for computers was £5,968. He even submitted the same invoice twice for one computer he bought.

He also used his parliamentary expenses to ‘entertain his European contacts’ and claimed for ‘extensive’ book purchases.

Commons expenses watchdogs said his claims for extensive European travel, including air fares, hotels and meals were of the ‘utmost gravity’.

Mr MacShane claimed for eight computers on parliamentary expenses, and gave one to an intern when they stopped working for him

Labour leader Ed Miliband moved quickly to suspend Mr MacShane from the party today

In total the claims made between 2004 and 2008 were worth 
£12,900. The Standards and Privileges Committee said it was impossible 
to say how much Mr MacShane claimed ‘outside the rules’, but it ‘may 
have been in the order of £7,500’.

One MP on the committee said: ‘Based on what I have seen I think he should be in jail.’

Here is Denis MacShane's full resignation statement:

'In the light of the Parliamentary 
Commissioner's decision supported by the Committee of Standards and 
Privileges to uphold the BNP complaint about expenses claimed in 
connection with my parliamentary work in Europe and in combating 
anti-semitism I have decided for the sake of my wonderful constituency 
of Rotherham and my beloved Labour Party to resign as an MP by applying 
for the Chiltern Hundreds or as guided by the House authorities.

'I have been overwhelmed by messages 
of support for my work as an MP on a range of issues but I accept that 
my parliamentary career is over.

'I appreciate the committee's ruling 
that I made no personal gain and I regret my foolishness in the manner I
 chose to be reimbursed for work including working as the Prime 
Minister's personal envoy in Europe.

'I want to thank the people of 
Rotherham for allowing me to serve as their MP and the Labour Party for 
allowing me over the years to fight for the causes I believe in.

'I have received so many messages 
supporting me from Labour and Tory MPs as well as members of the public 
but I love the House of Commons and I hope by resigning I can serve by 
showing that MPs must take responsibility for their mistakes and accept 
the consequences of being in breach of the House rules.'

Mr MacShane resigned as an MP after the Labour Party kicked him out and pronounced his career ‘effectively over’.

A source close to Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Denis has done the right thing.’

But the affair is hugely embarrassing for Mr Miliband since he had only re-admitted him to the Labour Party in July.

That came after the police announced that they were not pursuing fraud charges against Mr MacShane.

But last night Scotland Yard said they
 had not closed the case but had simply decided to take ‘no further 
action’ after advice from the Crown Prosecution Service.

Police did not previously have access 
to evidence used by the Standards Commissioner since it was subject to 
Parliamentary privilege.

A Met Police spokesman said the force would now
 consider the contents of the Commons report.

Mr MacShane could still avoid charges 
because letters in which he makes a number of frank statements about his
 expenses claims submitted to the inquiry could not be used as evidence 
in court.

The Commons Clerk of the Journals, 
Liam Laurence Smyth, who is responsible for parliamentary privilege 
issues, confirmed that he believed none of Mr MacShane’s correspondence 
or other evidence would be admissible.

But he said police may now be 
able to use the letters as a ‘map’ to further their own inquiries.

Tory MP Philip Davies has written to 
Scotland Yard calling on them to reopen their inquiries.

He proclaimed 
the findings ‘astonishing’ and said they ‘raise serious questions about 
whether Mr MacShane is guilty of criminal behaviour’.

He said: ‘If someone has committed an 
offence then they should face the full force of the law and to be 
protected by parliamentary privilege is most unsatisfactory.’

A second 
letter calling for the case to be reopened has also been submitted by 
blogger Paul Staines, who runs the Guido Fawkes website.

Police will now examine the evidence 
that between 2005 and 2008 Mr MacShane submitted 19 invoices from a body
 called the European Policy Institute (EPI) for work including ‘research
 and translation work as agreed’ and ‘research and translation 
consultancy’.

During part of that period he was a European envoy to then
 prime minister Tony Blair.

But the EPI had ‘no formal structure’.
 Names given on letterheads for general manager, an acting director and 
four associate directors were old friends of Mr MacShane.

The 
organisation had no office and there had never been any salaried staff. 
The bank account was controlled by Mr MacShane himself.

2004: A visit to Madrid to inspect how Spain's new Government would impact British politics.

2005: January: Trip to Switzerland to meet MPs. Summer: Trip to France and the Netherlands     ahead of referendums on EU treaty followed by a visit to Warsaw ahead of Poland joining the EU.

2006: February: A visit to Poland to report on the country's politics. March: A visit to Berlin. Spring: Two visits to Switzerland to meet diplomats followed by trips to Paris and Pristina.

2007: Spring: A trip to France ahead of Presidential election. May: France again. November: A trip to Berlin, Paris, Frankfurt and Genoble.

2008: December: A trip to Warsaw for EPI meetings.

The MPs on the Standards and 
Privileges Committee said Mr MacShane’s expertise on Europe ‘does not 
excuse his behaviour in knowingly submitting 19 false invoices over a 
period of four financial years which were plainly intended to deceive 
the parliamentary expenses authorities. This is far from what would be 
acceptable in any walk of life.’

While Mr Macshane repaid the wrongly claimed expenses, the report found his actions went 'far beyond what was allowable' under paliamentary rules.

Mr MacShane, a BBC journalist before he entered the world of politics, last night appeared to be 
in denial, issuing a bizarre statement blaming his plight on the British
 National Party, which submitted the initial complaint about his abuse 
of expenses.

He claimed his transgression was ‘the 
manner I chose to be reimbursed for work including working as the prime 
minister’s personal envoy in Europe’.

Tory MP Philip Davies today asked the police to 'to consider reopening the investigation into Mr MacShane'

Dear Sirs, 

As you will be aware, today the Parliamentary Committee on Standards and Privileges has published its report regarding the expenses claims of Denis MacShane MP.

The findings are astonishing and raise serious questions about whether Mr MacShane is guilty of criminal behaviour. 

I note Section 17 of the Theft Act 1968 below:

False accounting.

(1)Where a person dishonestly, with a view to gain for himself or another or with intent to cause loss to another,— 

(a) destroys, defaces, conceals or falsifies any account or any record or document made or required for any accounting purpose; or

(b) in furnishing information for any purpose produces or makes use of any account, or any such record or document as aforesaid, which to his knowledge is or may be misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular; he shall, on conviction on indictment, be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. 

(2) For purposes of this section a person who makes or concurs in making in an account or other document an entry which is or may be misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular, or who omits or concurs in omitting a material particular from an account or other document, is to be treated as falsifying the account or document.

I understand that the evidence collected by the committee during its investigation was subject to parliamentary privilege, and thus could not be used by the CPS.

Now that the report has been published, and parliamentary privilege no longer applies, I would ask you to consider reopening the investigation into Mr MacShane.

Yours faithfully

Philip Davies MP
