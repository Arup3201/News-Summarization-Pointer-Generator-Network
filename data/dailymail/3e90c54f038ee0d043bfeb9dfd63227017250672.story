The teenage girl who survived a deadly axe-attack that killed three of her family suffered such severe brain damage she may never be able to tell investigators what happened. 

Marli van Breda, 16, was struck several times on the head in her family's South African home last month, but relatives have still not been allowed to see her.

Visitors have been banned from the former Perth schoolgirl's hospital room in a bid to keep her 20-year-old brother Henri away, The Sunday Times reports.

'They fear she might go into shock, or will be traumatised further if she sees him,' a source told the South African newspaper.

Marli's mother Teresa, 54, was found dead on the balcony  and police discovered her deceased father Martin, 55, and brother Rudi, 22, in a bedroom.

Henri escaped with light injuries and rang police to report the deaths at the Stellenbosch home, east of Cape Town, on January 27.

While Marli is awake and struggling to overcome her injuries, police fear she may not recover enough to provide a full account of the night she was attacked.

She has recovered the ability to blink in response to questions, but police will have to rely on forensic evidence if they can't get a full statement from her.

Marli's head is still heavily bandaged and she reportedly mumbles and cries when she sees photos of her parents and brother.

'It is heartbreaking to see tears rolling down her cheeks,' a person close to the family told The Sunday Times.

It emerged last month that an audio recording of the emergency phone call made by Henri, obtained by eNews Channel Africa, seems to reveal him 'giggling' as he explains the details of the bloody massacre.

While Marli is awake and struggling to overcome her injuries, police fear she may not recover enough to provide a full account of the night she was attacked 

'What kind of injuries are there?' a woman can be heard asking Henri, who responds: 'my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe.'

When asked if they were unconscious, he responded, 'yes, and bleeding from the head', before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard.

A cleaner who worked for one of the van Breda's neighbours saw the young man, covered in blood, using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack.

The young man's mental health has been under speculation since News24 reported he had undergone brain scans at an Australian hospital in 2014. However the results were revealed to have been negative and no further testing occurred.

A doctor who examined him following the attack revealed his injuries were self-inflicted. He was also reportedly addicted to tik and his allowance had been cut off before his family were attacked. 

Henri has been living with his uncle, Her Breda, since the attack and has been receiving counselling. 

His uncle denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply hidden from the media's gaze.

'For obvious reasons Henri is very heartbroken, and we will support him as the family,' he was quoted in The Times.

'We as a family are here for him, we will not disappoint him... I promise Henri I won't drop him.'

No one has been charged over the attack on the family and Marli has a round-the-clock police guard.

Devastated friends who knew the family in Australia paid tribute to the axe attack victims earlier this month.

Rudi (pictured left and right) has been remembered by friends as a keen sportsman. His younger brother Henri is currently living with his uncle Her after suffering light injuries

The family were based in Perth and the Sunshine Coast in Australia, before returning to South Africa in mid-2014.

Rudi's friends have been leaving tributes on social media, with his university friend Afif Norzal saying: 'You are a true blue genuine mate my friend.

'At times when I didn't have anyone to talk to, you would definitely make me feel the most welcome... I will always love you.'

Family friend Retha Dutton said Rudi was visiting his parents and siblings before he returned to university for the final year of his Masters of Engineering.

Mr Norzal told Daily Mail Australia in an interview: 'He was one of those guys - me being from a different culture - he was one of the first friends who genuinely connected with me.

'He was one of those people when he talked to you, you genuinely knew this guy wanted to be your mate. He was a really chilled and laidback person. He never stressed about anything.' 

A spokesman for the University of Melbourne released a statement saying: 'A Dean's honours list member for Science in 2011, Rudi was a keen sportsman and was highly regarded amongst his peers as a good-natured and friendly person, someone who was always willing to lend a hand and help out younger students.' 

Henri returned to South Africa with his parents in mid-2014. He had been living at Trinity College where his brother was staying while studying at the University of Melbourne in 2013. Both attended Scotch College in Perth.

Ms Dutton told Daily Mail Australia: 'Teresa was a lovely mother... She was so happy all her children were with her, the boys had came from Australia (to visit).

'Henri moved back to South Africa in the middle of last year and he stayed with his family. She loved having him with her. She always used to tell me how wonderful it was.' 

Her husband Martin was the managing director of Engel and Voelkers Australia, an international property firm which has offices in Perth and Queensland. Friends described him as a 'great man' with a bright future ahead of him.

Peter Armitage tweeted: '(He) was going to change SA (South Africa)... Folks, live for today. Tell people you love them today.'

Mr Armitage said Martin was the founder of Netstar and Woodhill College. Martin's golf club also paid their 'deepest condolences' to the family on Twitter.

Paul Freney, a friend and colleague of Martin's at Engel and Voelker,  told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife Teresa were committed parents to their three children.

'Committed parents' The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia

'They were very nice people. Martin loved his rugby. He was an avid Force supporter from Western Australia. We used to go to the rugby together, he loved his golf.'

'Teresa... looked after the business of running the home and all that sort of stuff, and I imagine had a fair bit to do.'

'He was a very intelligent man and he was obviously very wealthy, had a lot of money, but it was all earned through his own endeavours.'   

The van Breda family spent several years living in the Perth suburb of Claremont. Around 2012 they moved to the Sunshine Coast, where Engels and Volker had an office. 

Ms Dutton, whose daughter is close friends with Marli, said she last saw the family on January 2 in South Africa. She said they were a 'very, very happy family'.  

A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family'

Marli was enrolled at Matthew Flinders Anglican College at Buderim while she was in Year 9. A school spokesman said the community was 'very sad to hear the tragic news'.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Marli, her family and those who love her,' the spokesman said.  

She is currently a student at Somerset College in South Africa.  

The school's headmistress Meg Fargher, described the Year 11 student as a  'lovely, popular, clever girl' whose parents were very involved in the school, news24 reported. 

Both schools are providing access to counsellors for students.  

Emergency medical services spokesman Robert Daniels told reporters it was obvious that the victims were attacked with an axe.

'What I can say is they were not shot, the patients were axed,' Mr Daniels told the Cape Times. 'The daughter was rushed to hospital with severe head trauma and a severed jugular.

He said Henri was treated at the scene for minor bruises on his arms. 

Family friend Alexander Boshoff, 19, described the Van Bredas' as a 'typical happy family', according to South African news reports. 'Our families often spent holidays together. We have known each other for years,' he said.

Mr Boshoff said the family moved around a lot due to Martin's work but the boys never complained and then added that they were 'like a perfect family'.

A special memorial service open to the public will be held at 5pm on Thursday February 5 for the van Breda family at Marli's former Queensland school - Matthew Flinders Anglican College­.
