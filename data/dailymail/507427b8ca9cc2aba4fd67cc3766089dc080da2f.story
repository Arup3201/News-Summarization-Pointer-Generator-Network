With roads and tube lines set to be more congested than ever this summer a few people may be tempted to use it an excuse for a day off.

But for employees at data services provider Interxion a chaotic commute during the Olympics will hold no weight.

That's because, in a bid to keep things ticking over this summer, bosses at the London company are asking staff to sleep at work - in space pods.

Sleeping on the job: Staff at London based Interxion will be given the choice to sleep at work during the Olympics, in a bid to avoid busy commutes

Far from sleeping on the job engineers at the Brick Lane based firm in east London will be asked to stay behind and sleep in the claustrophobic capsules to avoid the rush hour. 

And while other companies are set to offer staff the luxury of working from home during the Games the firm behind the capsules hope to get more workplaces on board.

Podtime, the firm behind the unusual cabins, are billing them as the perfect solution to the Olympics' congested commute.

On their official website they state 'London businesses will be severely affected by the transport 
problems caused by the Olympics.

Pods: These Podtime sleeping capsules have been marketed as a solution to traffic congestion during the summer

Mod cons: Some of the pods can be fitted with CD and DVD players to keep staff entertained

'Cost effective and versatile pods 
provide the best solution to this by allowing your staff to stay on site
as necessary, in comfort and privacy.'

Coming in a range of colours, the capsules made of polycarbonate, sell at anything from £1,375.

The stock models are fitted with either foam mattresses or a standard single mattress as well as a storage shelf,  mirror and power points.

Tight squeeze: There is limited space in the pods as shown here

Basic: Some of the pods are fitted with just a foam or single mattress

These types of capsules have been around for years, in hotels, but Interxion is thought to be among the first to have them stalled at the workplace.

An independent report carried out by Oxford 
Economics last year estimated that around 450,000 visitors will stay in the 
capital while 5.5 million people will visit for at least a day during the Games.

This will inevitably mean more cars on the road and greater congestion on the Underground.
