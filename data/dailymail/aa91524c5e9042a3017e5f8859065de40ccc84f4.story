Nicola Adams' hopes of making a successful defence of her Olympic title in Rio next year could rest on a potential showdown with domestic rival Lisa Whiteside in Liverpool next month.

Adams and Whiteside have both confirmed entries in the flyweight division at the English national championships from April 24 to 26.

Whiteside issued a major challenge to Adams' domestic dominance when she boiled down to 51kg to win a silver medal at last year's World Championships in South Korea in Adams' injury-enforced absence.

The pair have never fought as seniors but, as both are seeded, barring major upsets it is expected they will square off on the final day of competition at the Echo Arena.

A victory for Whiteside would leave the Great Britain selectors with a major headache ahead of confirmation of the team to go to Brazil in 2016.

The competition will mark the first time Adams has competed in the Championships since 2007, and her first bout on on English soil since her Olympic gold medal triumph at London 2012.

Adams won Olympic gold at London 2012 but if she is beaten by Whiteside she could lose her place in 2016

Adams said: 'It will be great to be part of such an historic event and to have the opportunity to box in England again.

'Being part of the GB boxing squad we tend to box overseas the vast majority of the time so to have the chance to compete in my home country again will be fantastic.'
