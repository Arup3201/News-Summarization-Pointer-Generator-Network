Beauty giant Sephora has been slammed by its customers in the US for marketing a lipstick which is named 'Underage Red'. 

The offensively-labeled item, which is part of a range of beauty products created by tattoo artist-turned-reality star Kat Von D, real name Katherine von Drachenberg, 33, has caused outrage among customers, many of whom have taken to social media to vent their anger at the store.

'Went shopping for some makeup. How on earth is this a lipstick color?' one person questioned on Twitter, after posting a picture of the lipstick name.

Cult favorite: According to the Sephora website (pictured), Underage Red, a 'matte fire engine red' lipstick, is particularly popular with customers 

'JESUS do they have a whole sex offender line?' someone else tweeted. 

'Lipstick named by creeps,' another person added.  

Some people, however, chose to see the 'funny side' of the bizarrely-named lipstick, which is believed to have launched around a year ago in stores, and others went as far as to defend Ms Von D's decision to opt for such a risky name.

'So dumb that people are upset over a lipstick color,' one girl tweeted. 

'"Underage Red" is a hilarious title, especially coming from Kat Von D. Its funny, guys.'

The lipstick, which is currently available on the Sephora website and in select stores, is described as being a 'matte fire engine red' and is also highlighted by Sephora as being a 'cult favorite' with its customers. 

Two types of 'Underage Red' lipsticks are also available at Sephora's first Australian store in Sydney

Two types of 'Underage Red' lipsticks are also available at Sephora's first Australian store in Sydney, which opened on December 5 last year.

They include the Everlasting Liquid Finish Lipstick for AUD $30 ($20) and the Studded Kiss Lipstick for $31 ($21). 

Other names included in the Studded Kiss Lipstick line-up include Lolita, Hellbent, and Sexer.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Sydney Sephora for comment.

Interestingly, it is not the first time that the name choices for these lipsticks have been questioned by Sephora's customers. 

In November 2013, the cosmetics company was forced to issue an apology to its customers and pull a Kat Von D lipstick with the shade description 'Celebutard' from its stores and website after receiving numerous complaints about the 'insensitivity' of the lipstick's name.

Outrage: Many people have tweeted their horror at the controversial lipstick name

Under fire: It is not yet known how Sephora will respond to the controversy surrounding the lipstick name 

'It has come to our attention that the name of one shade of a lipstick we carry has caused offense to some of our clients and others,' a Sephora spokesperson said in a statement at the time. 

'We are deeply sorry for that, and we have ceased sale of that shade both in our stores and online.' 

According to People.com, Ms Von D refused to apologize for the controversial lipstick moniker and even took to Twitter to defend the name, saying: 'At the end of the day, it's just a f*****g lipstick.' 

The Kat Von D beauty range is also not the only make-up collection to include a lip product bearing the suggestive label. 

MAC cosmetics are also currently marketing an 'Underage' lip gloss - despite parents calling for the popular beauty brand to change the name. 

'In what world is naming a lipgloss Underage a good idea?' one person tweeted at the time, while another stated: 'Can't get over @MACcosmetics naming a lipgloss 'Underage'. So gross.'
