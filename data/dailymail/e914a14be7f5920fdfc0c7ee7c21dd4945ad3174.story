The little girl who was brutally stabbed 19 times by two friends obsessed with the fictional Slender Man has returned to school after a difficult summer of doctors appointments, surgeries and healing. 

The 12-year-old started seventh grade on Tuesday after her sixth grade years was cut short when she was lured into the woods and allegedly attacked by Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier.

A family spokesman revealed to WITI-TV that the girl - whose name has not been revealed - has been excited to go back to school for weeks.

He said the summer has been difficult for her and her family. She has undergone dozens of doctors visits - sometimes ten a week - surgeries, and counseling appointments.  

'Throughout the summer, the parents would write on a grocery list, and put down groceries, and at the bottom of the list she’d always write ‘school supplies.’ Every week: ‘school supplies’ - so she wanted to get back to school. She was excited about it,” Stephen Lyons said. 

On May 31, Geyser and Weier lured her into the woods in Waukesha - a Milwaukee suburb - after a sleepover. They held their girl down and stabbed and slashed her 19 times then left her for dead, according to police.

She crawled out of the woods and flagged down a passerby. Medics found her bloody and covered in wounds to her legs, arms and torso.

The girls later told cops that they attacked their friend to prove their devotion to Slender Man - a fictional character from spooky online stories. The girls said they believed was real.

Geyser and Weier were arrested and charged as adults with attempted murder. 

The girl's recovery from the attack has been intensive and arduous, including a long list of specialists and surgeries. 

'A typical week, for weeks at a time, eight or 10 doctors appointments,' Mr Lyons told WITI. 

The girl's medical bills are expected to reach more than $400,000. 

Supporters have started a GoFundMe page to assist with expenses. The campaign has raised just over $61,000.
