A sex offender who had taken vodka shots through his eyeballs before raping a teenage girl as she lay drunk in bed at a house party has been given a 10 year sentence.

Mitchel Ward, 21, was told by a judge at Leeds Crown Court that he poses 'a serious danger' to women.

Ward pleaded guilty to raping the teenage victim at a house party in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in November last year.

Leeds Crown Court heard Ward had gone to a party at the property with his girlfriend and drank heavily.

Denise Breen-Lawton said the 21-year-old had been doing 'eyeball shots' - in which he poured vodka directly into his eye in order to get drunk more quickly.

During the evening people at the party played spin the bottle and the victim had ended up in just her underwear.

The court heard the teenager then decided to go to bed because she felt sleepy.

Ward went into the bedroom later in the evening and laid beside her in bed, before asking the girl if he could have sex with her  - but she refused.

At around 7.30am the next morning she awoke to find Ward having sex with her.

He was arrested after the girl told her parents about what had happened.

Ward, from Leeds, initially denied any wrong-doing.

He described the victim as a 'strange one' and told officers that he did not like her.

Ward pleaded guilty to rape after forensic evidence linked him to the offence.

He has a previous conviction for sexual offences after having sex with a 13-year-old girl in 2009.

Simon Alexander, defending, said Ward was 'sorry' for what he had done and had pleaded guilty to the offence at an early stage in the case. 

He said Ward accepted that he would be facing a lengthy prison sentence.

Mr Alexander said Ward was 'keen' to receive help while in custody to address his offending behaviour.

Judge Neil Clark told Ward he must serve five years in custody followed by a period on licence for a further five years.

He said: 'It is clear that you have ruined her life in many ways. I only hope that the passage of time will help with her recovery.'

The judge added: 'You present a high risk of harm to females. It is of note that on both occasions you placed blame at the door of your victims.'
