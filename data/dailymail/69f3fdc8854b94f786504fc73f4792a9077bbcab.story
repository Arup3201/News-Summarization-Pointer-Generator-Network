Nelson Mandela described the pain as like having ‘fire shooting through my veins’ - and it was likely to have been an equally unpleasant experience for these young gentlemen.

A set of astonishing photographs taken today show a group Xhosa boys covered with blankets in a field as they undergo the traditional male circumcision ceremony into manhood in South Africa.

The ceremony was taking place in Qunu, near the home of the 94-year-old former South African president, who has been in hospital for most of this month and is said to be in a critical condition.

Thousands of teenage boys from the tribe go through the rite of passage each year, spending a month studying in isolation and undergoing the painful circumcision by a traditional surgeon.

But human rights activists have called for an end to dangerous cultural traditions after 42 boys died from botched circumcisions in just three weeks last year, reported The Guardian.

This figure was almost double the total of 26 reported over the same period in 2011. Then, five boys were so badly injured that their genitals had to be amputated - and 300 were taken to hospital.

Non-governmental group the Sonke Gender Justice Network last year called for intervention, with a spokesman saying: ‘Why do we allow certain cultural practices to rob young people of their future?’

Concerns: South African police said last month that 23 teenagers had died in nine days at initiation ceremonies, and opened 22 murder cases in the deaths in the north-eastern province of Mpumalanga

Mr Mandela wrote in his autobiography that he went through the circumcision ceremony aged 16.

'I felt as if fire was shooting through my veins. The pain was so intense that I buried my chin in my chest'

He said: ‘Without a word, he took my 
foreskin, pulled it forward, and then, in a single motion, brought down 
his assegai [spear]. I felt as if fire was shooting through my veins.

‘The pain was so intense that I buried my chin in my chest. Many seconds seemed to pass before I remembered the cry, and then I recovered and called out, 'Ndiyindoda!' [I am a man!]’

South African police said last month that 23 teenagers had died in nine days at initiation ceremonies, and they had opened 22 murder cases in the deaths in the north-eastern province of Mpumalanga.

Tribal: In addition to being circumcised, the boys and young men are put through a series of survival tests

Initiation: Boys' faces are painted with red or white clay and they also are given herbal concoctions to drink

In addition to being circumcised, the boys and young men are put through a series of survival tests which sometimes include exposure to South Africa's chilly winter conditions with skimpy clothing.

Their faces are painted with red or white clay and they also are given herbal concoctions to drink.

Police said all the deaths were at government-registered initiation sites where medical practitioners are usually present. The Government became involved to prevent such unnecessary deaths.
