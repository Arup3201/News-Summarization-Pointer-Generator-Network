Disney's hit kids' movie Frozen may be the most Christian film to come out this year -- imitating Christ's sacrifice and featuring a main character that shares parallels with Satan.

That's the argument Collin Garbarino, an assistant professor of history at Houston Baptist University, made on Fox and Friends on Sunday.

Garbarino said the film's central relationship, between Snow Queen Elsa and her sister Anna, mirrors the sacrifices Jesus Christ made for sinners in the Bible.

Frozen, Garbarino says, could be the most Christian movie of 2013

'The Christian message is that people are sinners and have these broken relationships and that Christ comes and takes on the punishment for that sin, dies a death that he didn't deserve, then is resurrected and brings reconciliation through people,' Garbarino said on the program. 'And the problem [is that] Elsa has broken relationships. And she has guilt and she pushes people away. And her sister is sort of like a Christ figure who pursues her.'

'Anna comes and pursues and when she pursues [Elsa], she has to die and then she's resurrected which kind of proves the strength of her love and it brings reconciliation and Elsa is saved because her sister dies, and these are very strong Christian themes,' he continued.

Garbarino also told Fox he noticed 'some parallels' between Frozen and Dante's Inferno. He expressed similar sentiments in a blog post on Reflection and Choice, the official humanities blog for Houston Baptist University.

Garbarino compares Elsa's magical creation of a frozen palace, as well as her declaration of freedom in the song 'Let It Go,' with Satan's icy lair in Dante's text.

'Except, is Elsa really free?' he writes. 'She’s trapped herself in an ice palace, and she’s all alone. She’s not free. By indulging her gift, she’s imprisoned herself.' 

He says Frozen's Elsa, pictured, shares parallels with Satan, since both yearn for freedom but are ultimately trapped after using their talents for selfish purposes

'Satan has six great wings, and every time he flaps them, they produce an icy blast that further freezes him in place,' he says. 'His wings were a gift, but since he is trying to use his gift to serve himself rather than God, his wings have become a curse.'

Garbarino also writes that the children's film has elements similar to Milton's Paradise Lost.

Elsa's fall is 'in a manner consistent with the Western literary tradition’s picture of humanity’s decent into sin,' he writes. 'We call license “freedom,” and it enslaves us. Luckily for Elsa, a redeemer is coming to rescue her instead of leaving her trapped in her frozen hell.'
