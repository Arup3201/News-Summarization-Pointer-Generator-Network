Passengers flying with Ryanair are being forced to sign a waiver agreeing not to hold the budget airline responsible for damaged suitcases.

Holidaymakers jetting off to Malta from the UK claim they were told they would not be allowed to check in hold luggage without signing the document.

And they allege that when they arrived at Malta International Airport from Stansted in Essex on Wednesday, their suitcases were damaged.

New demands: Ryanair is allegedly forcing passengers flying from Stansted to Malta to sign a waiver

Declaration: The ticket that was stuck on to passengers luggage from Ryanair

The passengers claim they were told the system was introduced because of a surge in incidents at Malta International Airport.

And they said Ryanair slapped a bright 
green sticker on their luggage - in a bid to cut down on any potential 
lawsuits arising from damaged bags.

The
 tag that was stuck on passengers' bags reads: ‘Limited release. 
Carriers participating in the transport of this item may not accept 
claims resulting from the above conditions of acceptance.

‘This is not the Luggage Ticket (Baggage Check) described in Article 4 of the Warsaw Convention.’

One traveller, a 27-year-old marketing specialist from London, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I couldn't believe what they were forcing me to sign. I'm away for two weeks - of course I'm going to have hold luggage.

No claim: Passengers were told to sign a document stating they wouldn't sue the airline for damaged luggage

‘When I picked up my Samsonite suitcase in Malta it had been badly scratched and part of the case had cracked.

‘Those bags are designed to be tough, so for something to crack it like that must have involved a heck of a lot of force.’

Another passenger on the same flight also reported their bag had been damaged.

He said: ‘There were a lot of angry faces around the carousel, so I think most of the passengers had something bad happen to their bag.

‘A bottle of aftershave was smashed and has leaked all over my clothes, and now I can't claim against Ryanair. My holiday is ruined.’

Forced to sign: Passengers on board the flight from Essex to Malta were asked to sign the disclaimer

Officials from Malta International Airport have also hit out at Ryanair for forcing passengers to sign the disclaimer, because they have had no complaints about their handling of luggage.

Joe Bugeja, chief operations officer GlobeGround Malta Limited, the company that handles Ryanair luggage at the airport, said they had no knowledge of this new policy before they saw the stickers.

A spokesman for Malta International Airport added: ‘We reaffirm that this is a handling function of GlobeGround Malta.

‘Nevertheless, we shall be seeking clarification from Ryanair accordingly.’

Ryanair released a statement but declined to comment on any individual situation.

The statement read: 'If a customer is travelling with a bag that has any damage (minor/major) they are requested to complete a limited release tag so we can identify that the bag had been previously damaged prior to carriage on board a Ryanair flight.

'Ryanair processes baggage claims in full accordance with the Montreal Convention and Ryanair's General Terms and Conditions of Carriage.'
