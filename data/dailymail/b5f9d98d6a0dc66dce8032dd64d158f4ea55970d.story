Labour's work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves is set to announce plans to remove benefits from unemployed people who refuse training to get them back into work

Jobseekers who fail basic English and maths tests would lose their benefits if they refused training under Labour plans unveiled today.

Rachel Reeves will say all new applicants for jobseeker’s allowance should undergo a ‘basic skills test’ within six weeks of signing on.

‘Those who don’t have the skills they need for a job will have to take up training alongside their job search or lose their benefits,’ she will say in her first major speech as Labour’s work and pensions spokesman.

The policy is intended to indicate that after months of being branded the ‘Welfare Party’ by the Tories for refusing to back any of the Government’s benefits cuts, Labour is ready to countenance reform.

But critics pointed out the Government has already announced plans to pilot skills checks and training for the young unemployed, from day one of their claim.

Extending the policy across the system would not save money, but cost more, since training programmes for the jobless are expensive.

Miss Reeves, speaking to the Institute for Public Policy Research in London, will claim the Government’s failures are adding to the vast welfare bill.

She will say increased levels of youth and long-term unemployment will add to costs and hit tax revenues for ‘decades to come’.

She will also claim that record numbers of people are stuck in low-paid jobs, or working shorter hours than they want, resulting in rising expenditure on in-work tax credits and housing benefit.

‘Only Labour, the party of work, can deliver the reforms needed to tackle the causes of rising benefit bills, so we can keep the costs of social security under control, while recognising responsibility and contribution,’ Miss Reeves, who is increasingly tipped as the next Labour leader, will say.

Poor English and maths, she will add, often hold people back from getting jobs or trap them in a cycle of low-paid, insecure work and benefits claims.

Tests: Unemployed people claiming jobseeker's allowance would have to take English and maths tests within six weeks of signing on

‘A Labour government will introduce a basic skills test to assess all new claimants for jobseeker’s allowance within six weeks of claiming benefits,’ she will add.

‘Those who don’t have the skills they need for a job will have to take up training  alongside their job search or lose their benefits.

‘Labour’s basic skills test will give the long-term unemployed a better chance of finding a job and will help us to earn our way out of the cost-of-living crisis.’

Nearly one in ten out-of-work-benefit claimants lacks basic literacy skills, and one in ten lacks basic numeracy. The lack of IT skills is even more of a problem, with more than half unable to complete basic word processing and spreadsheet tasks.

A Tory spokesman said: ‘Labour are copying a Conservative policy that already exists and that is superior.’

In the autumn statement, George Osborne announced a pilot project to retrain young JSA claimants without Level 2 English and maths from day one of their claim.
