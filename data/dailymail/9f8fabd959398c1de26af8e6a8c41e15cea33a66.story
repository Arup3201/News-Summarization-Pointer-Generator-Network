A Texas meteorologist has spoken for the first time since he was gunned down last week as he left his TV station.

Patrick Crawford, of the NBC affiliate KCEN-TV in Bruceville-Eddy, says he still has no idea who the gunman was or why he would've been targeted.

'There was no interaction whatsoever,' Crawford, 35, told reporters at the Baylor Scott and White Hospital, where he has been recovering. 

'He just started shooting at me as I was leaving the parking lot of KCEN-TV station. So there was no interaction. I did not know him.'

The meteorologist was struck by two bullets. A third one grazed his head

Crawford was leaving work on Wednesday when the gunman fired 13 bullets on him from a semi-automatic gun before fleeing on foot, according to KCEN-TV.

Two of the bullets hit Crawford, one on the arm and another in the abdomen.

A third bullet grazed his head.

The weatherman managed to drive off and stopped his car in a construction zone, where workers called an ambulance.

Crawford wore a Superman t-shirt and sat on a wheelchair as he asked his colleagues in the media for privacy for his family.

Doctors said the meteorologist is expected home in time for the holidays.

'Things are improving.—I'm slowly getting better,' Crawford said. 'It's been a long process with a lot of pain.'

He added: 'My main focus is to just continue to get better, to get healthy and to get home for me and my family.'

Police continue to seek tips on the gunman, described as a bald white or Hispanic man in his 30s. Crime Stoppers offers a $10,000 reward for information, which can be sent to (800) 863-8558.

It remains unclear when Crawford will return to his job at KCEN-TV, but he says 'things are improving'
