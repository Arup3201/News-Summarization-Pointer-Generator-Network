Victims are to get the legal right to confront offenders in court over the devastating impact of their crimes.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is bringing in a law to replace an existing code of conduct that has failed to give enough victims a say in court.

It will also require state-funded barristers to undergo specialist training before taking on rape cases or others involving serious sexual offences over concerns that the prospect of a gruelling cross-examination dissuades many women from pursuing rape cases.

At present, just 18 per cent of reported rapes result in a suspect being charged.

Mr Grayling said the package of reforms, which also include the creation of a new Victims’ Information Service, would ensure the ‘highest emphasis’ was placed on the needs of victims.

Labour accused Mr Grayling of doing a U-turn after resisting their calls for a law on victims’ rights. Justice spokesman Sadiq Khan claimed ministers had let victims down. 

He said: ‘This announcement looks like it’s been cobbled together on the back of an envelope in the dying months of this Government.’

But Mr Grayling claimed the time had come to place greater emphasis on the needs of victims in the justice system.

He added: ‘Our criminal justice system can be daunting, and victims – especially the most vulnerable – can find it traumatic and difficult to know where to turn to for advice and support.

‘We will create a system that puts the highest emphasis on victims’ needs and sets out their rights clearly in legislation.’

Victims’ Commissioner Baroness Newlove welcomed the changes but said the Government needed to go further. 

She questioned how the plans would have helped the hundreds of victims of the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal who were ignored by the authorities for years.

‘It’s good to see they are listening to what victims need but I do want to know how and when their promises will be delivered,’ she said.

‘A new law cannot be used as a quick fix but it must be delivered properly and with teeth. 

'I want to see how it will be better than the existing Victims’ Code and how it will ensure that victims are treated with dignity and respect. 

Devastated: Geraldine and Peter McGinty

The parents of a murder victim were devastated after a parole hearing judge said impact statements ‘made no difference’.

Geraldine and Peter McGinty, pictured left, heard Judge Graham White’s comments when a video link was accidentally left open during a recent hearing.

The judge, who later apologised for his ‘private’ remarks, had heard from the couple when the court was deciding whether one of the killers of their son, Colin, 21, from Formby, Merseyside – who was stabbed to death in 2001 – should be allowed to move to an open prison.

'We’ve seen how the abuse of victims in Rotherham was covered up in such appalling ways. We heard how victims were treated with such prejudice that they were not believed by those who were there to protect them.

‘I’d like to know how a law would put a stop to this dismissive, ignorant and collusive behaviour.’

The decision to make state-funded barristers undergo training before handling serious sex cases follows the suicide of concert violinist Frances Andrade. 

She took an overdose a week after being subjected to a tough cross-examination by the lawyer for the former music teacher who abused her.

At an inquest this year in Woking, Surrey, coroner Richard Travers criticised the authorities for failing to give her enough support. 

The hearing was told how Mrs Andrade fell into a spiral of despair after giving evidence in the trial.
