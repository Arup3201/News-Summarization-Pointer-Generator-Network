A mobile phone app company has been fined £60,000 after children as young as three were able to access it and run up bills of up to £150.

French company Acetelecom were fined yesterday by a phone regulator after parents complained that children were just one click away from phoning their premium rate number to use its voice changing service.

The company ran a series of banner adverts that would appear on children’s apps promoting its voice-changing service.

Outrage: A tribunal blasted a mobile company for bringing children within one click of a premium-rate service that allows users to make their voices sound like Star Wars characters by running enticing adverts

By clicking on the advert the phone would ring the premium rate line at a cost of £1 a minute plus network rates.

The person could then record a message which would be digitally altered so they could sound like an alien or Star Wars character.

But unlike other similar services the call did not cut off once it reached a cap of £3.

This led to up to 14 complaints from parents who said their children had activated the number.

In one case the child was just three and in another a bill of £150 was charged.

Watchdog PhonepayPlus fined Acetelecom £60,000 and ordered it to refund all complaints in full within 28 days of being asked.

Acetelecom advertised its app and service on mobile phone apps and websites that were popular with young children.

Phone regulator PhonepayPlus said it appeared on Baby Flashcards, Talking Ginger and Toddler Flashcards.

The tribunal verdict said the voice-changing service was guilty of not fixing a cap on spending, not providing enough information on costs on its adverts and ‘treating consumers unfairly’.

They said that children were likely to find the company’s adverts appealing as they featured ‘bright colours and cartoonlike characters’.

One parent who complained said: ‘My daughter tapped it by accident which then immediately phoned the premium rate 090 number.

Under fire: The French app company, Acetelecom, has been fined for running the brightly-coloured adverts

Misled: The regulator warned companies to impose barriers to ensure children are not misled on mobiles

‘There was no secondary ‘are you sure you want to call this number’ fail safe which meant that she has run up a £15 charge on my bill. I think that it is ridiculous that this sort of ad is allowed on a children’s app.

‘The fact that this ad only needed to be tapped once before activating the phone call is ridiculous.’

Joanne Prowse, from PhonepayPlus, said: ‘By promoting its service in such a way as to mislead young children into clicking on a link which would automatically connect and charge them, and by failing to impose the required spend caps on a service which was clearly aimed at children, Acetelecom has treated children, and by extension their parents, unfairly.

‘Practices which mislead consumers, especially vulnerable consumers, and result in bill shock cause serious harm to those affected and to the wider reputation of the premium rate sector. PhonepayPlus will not tolerate them.’

The service has since been removed from publicly available banner ads but is instead available from app stores, where it must first be downloaded and credit must be purchased to use the service. Acetelecom did not respond to requests for comment last night.
