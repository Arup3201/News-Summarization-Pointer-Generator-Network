The problem occurred because the girl's lunch account had gone too low.

Usually when it is empty the money automatically transfers from her checking account.

But, in this incident 
there was a one-day delay, leaving the account in the student's account too low to cover the food items on her tray.

Northside Independent School District Spokesman Pascual Gonzalez said the school staff acted correctly.

He said the district’s cafeteria policy is very clear.

'The policy says that there is no 
charge account that's built in, either have the money to pay for your 
food or you're not going to eat, ' said Mr Gonzalez..

He explained that the school were required to throw the food away.

'I
know it sounds terrible, I totally get that, but the law states we 
cannot take that same food and put it back in the for sale line, ' added
Mr Gonzalez.

He argued that last year the district's unpaid charges totaled almost $27,000.

In the district elementary students can charge lunch up to five times, middle school students are allowed one charge, and high school students are not allowed to charge food.
