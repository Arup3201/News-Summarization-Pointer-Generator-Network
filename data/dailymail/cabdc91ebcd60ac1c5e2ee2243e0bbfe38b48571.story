It was a picture-postcard village pond, enjoyed by locals and the perfect natural habitat  otters for 150 years.

But now the former beauty spot in Kerry, north Wales, has been transformed into a muddy mess after the owner drained the pool of water without planning permission.

Furious environmental groups have blasted the move and called for the pond to be refilled and its beauty restored.

The owner John Pryce, however, says he will press on with work on the pond and is now awaiting a verdict on an application to Powys County Council's planning department.

The application, which is partly retrospective, seeks permission to construct a causeway and re-profile the pool which has existed since the 1860s.

However, the Countryside Council for Wales and Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust have both objected to the application on ecological grounds.

They say an island at the pool was used by otters prior to it being drained and the work carried out has destroyed their habitat.

They have called for the pond to be returned to its former state and the proposal to create a causeway is abandoned, in the hope of encouraging otters to return.

Local residents say they also have concerns that the pond will be used as a commercial fishery.

Muddy mess: Furious environmental groups say draining the pond has destroyed a natural habitat for otters

A letter submitted to PCC by MWT's conservation officer says: 'We know that otter used the site as recently as April 2012 and the work which was carried out subsequently destroyed their habitat, thereby contravening the legislation.

'The applicant therefore has a duty to carry out mitigation works as soon as possible to reinstate otter habitat on the site, including the removal of the part built causeway.'

However, the man behind the application denied plans to create a commercial fishery and said the work being carried out is vital to safeguard the future of the pond.

He also said he was not aware of the presence of any otters before carrying out the work but will contest the mitigation request and will attempt to fence the otters out if legally allowed.

He said: 'There has been a fishery there that has been fished for years. The quality of the lining means that this has not been viable and we intend to restore that.

'It's an area that needs maintenance. Our intention is to stop flooding and make the body of water secure and, secondly, make it something worth fishing.'

Mr Pryce said the causeway had been created 'because of the stuff that's dug out during the relining process'.

He added: 'We have had a lot of trouble with locals down there but we are talking about four or five people not the whole village by any stretch.

'What we are struggling to understand is what people's opinion to it is and what would suit them. I think it comes down to no change.'
