It is a story worthy of the big screen - how an iconic cinema hidden in a quiet corner of Leeds defied all the odds to stay open for a century.

The Hyde Park Picture House first opened its doors in November 1914 and quickly became the place to see news bulletins and morale-boosting dramas during the First World War.

Now a hub for art house and independent films - the venue is as popular as ever thanks to its position in the student heartland of Leeds, West Yorkshire.

Amazing landmark: The Hyde Park Picture House, on Brudenell Road, Leeds, is celebrating its centenary birthday today

The beautiful Grade II-listed Picture House is one of the oldest purpose-built cinemas in the UK - screening patriotic drama Their Only Son on its opening night on November 7 1914.

Despite the outbreak of war in August that year, the Hyde Park Picture House was built and opened ready for business.

Pages of the Yorkshire Evening Post were almost entirely devoted to news of the war but a small advert announced the opening of the new venue - proudly proclaiming itself to be 'The cosiest in Leeds'.

Since then it has fought to live up to this title and has managed to adapt to the ever-evolving world of cinema becoming a student hot-spot.

Film-making societies have their socials at the venue - Northern Film School choose it for their end of year show while Leeds College of Art also uses it to host inductions for those in their foundation year.

The cinema, which still uses 35mm film, is hosting a 1914-themed event showing archive footage - including newsreels, dramas and comedies - from the period

Industry challenges such as the transition to sound, the competition from television, the multiplex boom and home entertainment were all overcome, although in 1989 the landmark had to be saved from closure by Leeds City Council. 

It is now owned by the council as part of the Leeds Grand Theatre and Opera House Ltd - an independent company dedicated to preserving and securing the future of three of Leeds's most culturally significant venues.

The cinema has developed a film programme dedicated to screening independent, art-house and classic films from around the world. 

And now, to honour the grande dame of cinemas, a special evening of live music has been organised - courtesy of the After Hours Rauchestra swing band - alongside period screenings and newsreel showings, to transport cinema goers back 100 years.

The 'A Night at the Cinema in 1914' event forms part of the 28th Leeds International Film Festival and is one of six free screenings at the Picture House currently. 

Wendy Cook, Hyde Park Picture House's general manager, said: 'Getting to this point has only been made possible because of all the amazing support we've received over the years. 

'So to the countless staff members and volunteers, the thousands of wonderful audience members and our many partners and friends in this fantastic city, we'd like to thank each and every one of you for helping us get this far. 

'Here's to the next 100 years.'

A second event has been planned to celebrate the centenary on November 22, when a film commissioned by the Picture House and arts organisation Pavilion by artists Luke Fowler and Mark Fell is screened. 

Councillor Lucinda Yeadon, Leeds City Council's executive member for culture and skills, added: 'Leeds has a unique history with the art form of film dating back to October of 1888 when Louis Le Prince captured the first bit of moving image footage on Leeds Bridge. 

'By celebrating the centenary of the Hyde Park Picture House we are celebrating a culture of film watching and making in our city that we can all enjoy and that Leeds City Council is proud to be part of supporting.'

Debut: The first film to be shown at the picture House was the patriotic drama Their Only Son
