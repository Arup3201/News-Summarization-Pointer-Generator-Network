Niall Quinn is adamant only the strongest will be able to aim for glory on Friday evening. Those without the necessary fortitude risk being swept aside amid a maelstrom of emotion.

The Irish legend anticipates the atmosphere inside Celtic Park with an almost salivating relish. He will be confined to the relative sanctuary of a television studio, but admits he dreams of still being young enough to step out of the tunnel and into the white-hot battle.

Quinn views this Euro 2016 qualifier as just about the ultimate test of mentality. An international encounter imbued with all the passion, intensity and significance of any great club rivalry.

The potential is there for heroes to be born, for careers to find a defining moment. But there is also, Quinn warns, the capacity for the occasion to overwhelm those not ready for what lies in wait.

He does not see it being a game decided by the tactical scheming of Gordon Strachan or Martin O’Neill. Rather this will be football in its most gladiatorial form.

‘It’s about adapting to what will be an explosive atmosphere, just incredible,’ insisted Quinn.

‘I’m going to be there for Sky and all of us are absolutely anticipating the energy and emotion that will fill the place.

‘What team deals with it best and keeps their heads will be a big factor.

‘It’s going to be a cauldron of fear if you let it go that way, or a cauldron of energy if you let it help you along.

‘Those who are stronger-willed and stronger-minded will come out on top. But I’ m finding it very hard to decide which team is going to do that.

‘I see this as a different kind of game to any in the group so far. It’s not a normal European qualifier.

‘It is nearer Celtic v Rangers, Manchester City v United or Liverpool v Everton - that kind of intense derby occasion. It’s difficult to stress the importance of this match. It is about more than qualifying. It builds real passion and patriotic pride.

‘Whereas a lot of training for big qualifiers centres around getting videos of the opponents and maybe dealing with their No 10 or whatever, this comes with a totally different outlook. I think tactics will be secondary aspect.

‘It is man v man, like a throwback to the kind of games we had in the past.’

Ireland happen to have a man who has become iconic for doing that latter feat. Robbie Keane will be in the hunt for, quite remarkably, his 66th international goal when he returns to Parkhead following a prolific loan spell in 2010.

Now 34, Keane remains an essential part of O’Neill’s plans having flattened all manner of records over the course of 137 caps. The hat-trick he netted against Gibraltar last month made him the highest scorer in the history of European Championship qualifiers.

Quinn, second on Ireland’s goals list, is awestruck by Keane’s relentless consistency and feels he is tailor-made to influence the showdown with Scotland.

‘Robbie obviously knows Celtic Park well and he will love the atmosphere - full stop,’ enthused Quinn, who partnered Keane up front in the 2002 World Cup finals.

‘The bigger the atmosphere, the bigger the game, the more he can use his experience.

‘He can call upon all those positive things, memories of scoring there in the past and so on, to give himself the edge.

‘Robbie is a national treasure. He has done something extraordinary in his career, just phenomenal.

‘It beggars belief at times when you look at every other Irish goalscorer, including myself, and the amount of games we played.

‘He has got a hold of this record and driven it to a place where none of us mere mortals could dream about.’

Keane has warmed up for Glasgow in some style, scoring one and setting up three in LA Galaxy’s 5-0 rout of Real Salt Lake on Sunday evening. Being resident in California has not diminished any of his desire to represent his country.

‘When he went to America, people did ask if he would hold onto his place or whether others playing regularly in England could come in and take over,’ reflected Quinn

‘One or two flattered to deceive, but Robbie has seen them all off with his enthusiasm.’

Anthony Stokes is one of those left on the fringes by Keane’s evergreen effectiveness. Quinn was Sunderland chairman when Stokes played on Wearside – and fell foul of manager Roy Keane for off-field disciplinary issues.

‘Listen, Anthony always had quality,’ insisted Quinn. ‘He was great for Arsenal’s youth team then things got a bit more difficult for him. But he has knuckled down since and seems to be doing very well for Celtic.

‘To be honest, I’d have hoped he’d have amassed more caps than he has done. He needs to get himself into that Ireland team.

‘But that is the beauty of a game like this. If, at 0-0, Robbie comes off after an hour then those on the bench have to be ready.

‘Anthony has to believe there is a goal in him if he gets the chance – and work so hard in training that Martin points to him if a change is needed.’

Quinn feels Scotland’s opening display in Germany set the standard for a group he regards as by the far the toughest in the entire qualification process. Friday night now represents the most crucial staging post yet.

‘If someone comes away with three points, it is a huge advantage and a crushing blow for the loser,’ added Quinn.

‘I think I’ll probably dream about playing in it a few nights this week. Whether you a Scottish guy under Gordon or an Irish guy under Martin, you are under managers who have team spirit at the maximum.’
