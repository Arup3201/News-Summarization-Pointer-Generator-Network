An Italian-style mansion has gone up for sale with a £2m price tag – in the Welsh countryside.

The seven-bedroom Vaendre Hall was built for a superwealthy coal and shipping family when Cardiff was the centre of the Victorian coal trade.

The first ever million pound cheque was written at the city’s Coal Exchange when the Cory family were one of the multimillionaire families dominating the international coal trade.

The entrance to Vaendre Hall, with its own gatehouse, leads onto a sweeping driveway running up to the imposing building.

The Cory family made its fortune with the worldwide demand for South Wales steam coal in the mid-1800s including setting up a string of depots on shipping routes.

John Cory, the pater familias, was one of the earliest supporters of the Salvation Army and donated liberally to the Band of Hope Union and Dr Barnardo’s Homes.

The Italianate style was developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s and achieved huge popularity in the United States.

Peter Reilly for Savills the estate agent said: ‘It’s a very unusual house with a history and would be ideal as a family home.’
