A spike in inquiries for tattoo removal has jumped 300 per cent

Young Australians are queuing up at cosmetic surgeries and forking out thousands of dollars to have regrettable tattoos inked on their skin removed. 

In Australia alone, new research has revealed a rise of more than 300 per cent in the number of inquiries from people looking to rid of the shameful marks inked on their bodies.

A survey of tattooed Australians, conducted by the Cosmetic Physicians Society of Australasia, has found that at least one in four Australians over 20 have a tattoo, but a third of these people have indicated they regret that decision.

The largest number of people opting to have a former partner's name, spelling mistake or other regrettable mark removed are aged between 20 and 30.

CPSA spokesperson Catherine Porter said the results were a huge indication of the high number of Australians with tattoos that would rather be without them.

A former partner's name and spelling mistakes are just a few of the types of reasons people op to get tattoos removed

“We know that over 25 per cent of the Australian adults aged 20 years and over have a tattoo,' she said.

'We also know that a growing number of these people have come to regret their decision.'

She said some of the more common types of tattoos people have removed are names of a former partner and spelling mistakes.

While she said it can take less than an hour to have the tattoo inked, the removal process is much longer and people need to consider the long-term repercussions of getting a tattoo.

It could take anywhere up to a year, or 10 or more laser sessions, and a cost of more $5000 for a person to have a tattoo removed.

'Like all things, getting a tattoo may seem like a good idea today, but tomorrow it may be regretted,' Ms Porter said.

'A Friday night after party special, may end up costing more to remove than you anticipated at the time,' she said.

The more complex and colourful the tattoo, the more difficult it is to remove, she said, as different types of lasers are needed to break down the vast range of coloured ink particles.

The CPSA recommends that people seeking to remove tattoos, should consult a qualified aesthetic medical practitioner to ensure they are safely and effectively treated.

Ms Porter said there are a number of rogue operators with unregulated lasers, tempting people into opting for a cheap removal which could ultimately leave with unwanted scarring.,

'CPSA strongly recommends patients consult a medical practitioner to ensure that they get safely treated by trained professionals, avoiding scaring and the creation of a boggy unhealing mass that was once a tattoo,' she said.
