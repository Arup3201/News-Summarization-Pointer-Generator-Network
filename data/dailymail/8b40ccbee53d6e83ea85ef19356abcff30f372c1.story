Artist Concetta Antico (pictured) can see 100 times more colours than an average person

When most of us look a buttercup, we simply see yellow.

But one artist sees a whole host of extra colours around the flower's edge, because she is a tetrachromat and can see 100 times more hues than the average person.

Concetta Antico, who lives in San Diego, California, has more receptors in in her eyes to absorb colourful light, enabling her to see – and paint – the world around her in a different way to most people.

The average person can see approximately one million colours, whereas tetrachromats have an extra cone class in their eyes for colour vision that dramatically increases their range up to a potential 99 million.

Cones are structures in the eye that are designed to absorb particular wavelengths of light and transmit them to the brain.

Most people have three types of cones, but tetrachromats like Ms Antico have four types.

While only a handful of human tetrachromats have been identified, it is thought that around two per cent of women may possess the genes to see extra colours.

The average person has three types of cones, which are tuned to wavelengths of red, green and blue, and tetrachromats' fourth types can vary. 

It's thought that the condition is caused by mutations in the X chromosome, which make people to see more or less colour, PopSci reported.

These mutations make men more likely to be colour blind and mean that women more likely to be tetrachromats if they have mutations on both X chromosomes.

To make the most of her ability to see more colours, Ms Antico paints bright, impressionistic pictures of animals and landscapes and also tries to teach other people to see the colours around them in a new way.

She said: ‘Everyone has the potential to expand their ability to see colours the way I do, but our urban lifestyles and focus on technology is shutting it off.

I’m the one here waving the colour flag, teaching people to see the turquoise and greens in the grey rocks and even tap into their own interpretations of the colours that exist.’ 

The average person has three types of cones in their eyes, which are tuned to wavelengths of red, green and blue, but  tetrachromats have an extra type to enable them to see 100 times as many colours.

Tetrachromacy is the condition of possessing four independent channels for conveying colour information - which means four different types of cone cells in the eye.

The average person has three types of cone cells.

A tetrachromat’s retina contains four types of higher-intensity light receptors or cone cells with different absorption spectra.

This means they can may see wavelengths beyond those of a typical human being's eyesight and may be able to distinguish colours that to a human appear to be identical.

Lots of animals are tetrachromats, including birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and insects.

For example, the humble goldfish has cone cells for red, green, blue and ultraviolet light. It is thought that it gives animals an advantage when spotting minute dust particles, food and the movements of prey or predators.

It was only in 2012 that she was found to possess the genotype for tetrachromacy and she has been studied by the University of California Irvine.

Experts said that differences in colour perception are hard to detect because they are small and tests are not designed for more than three pigments – blue, red and green.

Based on Ms Antico’s genes, they think that her fourth cone absorbs wavelengths that are ‘reddish-orangey-yellow’ and are trying to explore whether this is how she sees things.

They said that her art has allowed her express her unusual vision and show people what it means to be a tetrachromat.

While scientists are studying the phenomenon to better understand how the brain works, Ms Antico has a more personal reason as to why she is involved in the research.

She has a 12-year-old daughter who is colour blind, likely because of her own genetic mutation.

Ms Antico hopes that the more experts understand about tetrachromacy, the more they will understand about visual processing, which could be used to help colour blind people. 

It was only in 2012 that Ms Antico was found to possess the genotype for tetrachromacy and she has been studied by the University of California Irvine since, while continuing to paint. Another one of her works is shown
