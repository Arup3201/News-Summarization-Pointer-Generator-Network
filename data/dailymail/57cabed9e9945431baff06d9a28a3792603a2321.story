Parents are making their children commute over huge distances as they engage in an 'arms race' to get their children into the best private schools.

The 'madness' of trying to secure places at top schools is 'writing off two years' of childhood, warned the headmistress of one of the UK's top preparatory schools.

Jane Grubb, head of Dunhurst - the prep school attached to Bedales senior school in Hampshire - said that drilling young children for entrance tests has an adverse effect on them.

Her remarks come as a private tutoring for youngsters ahead of the 11-Plus or Common Entrance exams is becoming increasingly commonplace across the UK.

She described the situation, in which some children commute for 10 hours a day to attend fee-paying schools, as a 'bunfight'.

Many parents will not send their children to local secondary schools after having attended prep schools as they do not think they are good enough, she said.

Mrs Grubb said that the pressure often starts when children are eight, with children spending two terms doing practice papers by the age of 10 in an effort to gain entry to top schools.

She said that parents in London should send their children to boarding schools outside the capital, rather than engaging in lengthy commutes for a limited number of private school places.

Mrs Grubb told the Evening Standard: 'I dread to think of the impact it has on children. Parents genuinely want them to be happy but they need to put their heads
up and see what other life there is.

'The 10 hours they spend commuting 
could be spent getting more sleep or seeing their friends.'

'I can’t imagine parents want their children studying into the night and
having personal tutors and writing off two years of their childhood. 
But some do because they don’t know there is something else out there.'

Bedales, charges £30,000 a year for boarders, and £21,000 for those attending the prep school.

The school boasts a number of famous faces as alumni, including Daniel Day-Lewis, Kirstie Allsopp and Sophie Dahl.

Her comments come as a collection of 13 Buckinghamshire grammar schools is backing a 'tutor-proof' 11-plus exam to be introduced this autumn.

Designed by the University of Durham, the test involves sequences, pictures and diagrams, rather than more traditional forms of testing.
