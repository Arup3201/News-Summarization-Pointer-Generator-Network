The Archbishop of York has told how he set free the spirit of a girl who was terrified she would be used as a human sacrifice after visiting a witches coven.

The child was terrified she would be killed by witches after she saw the ritual slaughter of a goat, Archbishop John Sentamu said during a debate in the House of Lords.

She was so afraid she would wake in the night screaming in terror, he revealed.

Cure: Archbishop of York John Sentamu told the House of Lords how he set the spirit free of a girl who was terrified she would be made a human sacrifice

He said the young girl had been paralysed by fear and despite a GP, a psychiatrist and a psychologist visiting the child's south London home, the girl was petrified she would be coven's next sacrifice.

Speaking to peers on Wednesday the 
Archbishop said: 'When I first became a vicar of a parish in south 
London I was invited into a home because somebody said that there was a 
presence there.

'I did not understand that phrase but
I went into the home where there was a young girl who had not been able
to move for nearly three weeks.

'The GP, a psychiatrist and a psychologist had visited the house. Sometimes the girl shouted a lot in the middle of the night. Somebody said that they had been to a witches' coven that night where a goat had been sacrificed.

Terrified: The Archbishop said the girl had visited a witches coven, similar to the one 
pictured in Nepal, and witnessed the sacrifice of a goat. She then became terrified that she
would be next

'She was absolutely petrified that she would be sacrificed next. She could not speak apart from shouting.'

To rid the child of the spirit, the Archbishop said he anointed her with oil and lit a candle.

He told the House of Lords: 'I left and received a telephone call later to say that the young girl was no longer terrified and had started to speak.

'That was not mental or physical illness; there was something in her spirit that needed to be set free.'

Dr Sentamu was speaking during a debate on an amendment of the NHS bill for England where he called for spiritual health to be part of the government's agenda for health.

During the debate the Anglican Archbishop said schools now emphasised students' spiritual side, as well as their physical and mental well being.

If passed the Health and Social Care Bill would give doctors more responsibility for their own budgets while greater competition with the private sector would be encouraged.
