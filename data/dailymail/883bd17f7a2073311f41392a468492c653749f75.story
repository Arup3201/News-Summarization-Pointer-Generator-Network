A captain involved in a Hong Kong ferry disaster which left 39 partygoers dead - including a British child - has been convicted of manslaughter.

Lai Sai-ming was found guilty of 39 counts of manslaughter, and also found guilty of endangering the safety of others at sea after a 60 day trial. 

The accident was Hong Kong's worst maritime disaster for more than four decades.  

Sunk: The pleasure cruiser, carrying 124 people, including three members of staff, went down shortly after 8pm on October 1, 2012

Trail: A 60 day trial saw Chow Chi-wai, left, skipper of the pleasure cruiser, and ferry captain Lai Sai-ming, right, point the blame at each other

Lai was captain of the Kowloon Ferry's Sea Smooth, which collided with the pleasure cruiser Lamma IV near the island of Lamma, around two miles south west of Hong Kong island, in October 2012. 

The Lamma IV - which had 124 people on board, including three staff members - was taking a group out to watch the fireworks.

The fireworks were part of a celebration for China's national day.

But the two boats collided, and the pleasure cruiser sank shortly after the ferry collided with it at about 8pm, leaving 39 dead, including eight children, and more than 100 needing hospital treatment.

At the time, it was reported a British child was among the dead. 

The high-speed ferry managed to make it back to shore. 

The Lamma IV's skipper, Chow Chi-wai, had also been accused of manslaughter, but was cleared by the same jury after 35 hours of deliberation, the South China Morning Post reported. 

But he was found guilty of endangering lives of others at sea. 

Devastating: The sinking was the worst maritime disaster to take place in Hong Kong waters since 1971

Death toll: A total of 39 people died, including eight children. At the time, it was widely reported one of the children was a Brit

Both men had pleaded not guilty to all charges, and had pointed the finger of blame at each other during the trial. 

Chow's lawyer refused to comment after the hearing, while Lai's lawyer confirmed his client was due to be sentenced on Monday.  

It was Hong Kong's worst maritime disaster since 1971, but several other incidents since -- including two high-speed ferry accidents which injured scores of passengers and the grounding of a large container ship -- have worried those who cross Hong Kong's waters.
