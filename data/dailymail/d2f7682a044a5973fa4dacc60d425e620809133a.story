Reality TV stars the Little Couple have told of their delight after adopting a baby boy from China who, like them, has dwarfism.

Jennifer Arnold and her husband Bill Klein, both 34, announced they are soon to take custody of a three-year-old called William.

The couple, from Houston, Texas, had hoped to become parents through a surrogate mother but she miscarried in November last year.

Proud parents: The stars of TV show the Little Couple, Dr Jennifer Arnold and Bill Klein, have announced they have adopted a baby boy from China

In a statement the delighted couple said: 'We are thrilled to announce that we have adopted a beautiful young boy from China.

'We are so proud to welcome William to our family and look forward to bringing him home.'

The couple's desire to become parents has been a recurring theme of their reality show which first aired in January 2009 and is now into its sixth series.

The couple were filmed discussing the possibility of adopting last year after 
attempting to become parents through a surrogate who suffered a 
miscarriage

After their surrogate's miscarriage, they were filmed discussing the possibility of adoption on an episode of the show in March last year.

Arnold, a neonatologist who works at the Texas Children's Hospital, said: 'My entire life, even before I met Bill, I always thought, "Oh, I'd love to adopt a child who is another little person".Â 

'And Bill and I talked about it after we got married, and I think we both realized we both would like that.'

The adoption story will form a key part of the show's sixth series which premieres on April 30.
