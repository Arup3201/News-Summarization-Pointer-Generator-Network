The Daily Mail has been named one of the UK's most popular internet searches of 2013, according to Google's most recent statistics.

The news title was revealed to be the eighth most popular UK search term in Google's 2013 Zeitgeist List, a who's who of the year's most relevant people and places on the web.

The Daily Mail’s website, MailOnline, is the world’s biggest English language newspaper site, with 57.3 million monthly unique visitors globally.

According to Google, the 8th most popular term to search for across the whole of the UK in 2013 was the Daily Mail. The top search result for this term is the Daily Mail's website MailOnline, pictured. It was one of the only news sources to make the top 10 list, alongside BBC News, in the annual Zeitgeist report

1. Facebook

2. YouTube

3. Google

4. Hotmail

5. eBay

6. BBC News

7. Amazon

8. Daily Mail

9. Argos

10. Yahoo

It was one of only two news sources to make the top 10 list, alongside BBC News.

Facebook topped the list as the 
most popular term people typed into Google in 2013, followed by YouTube,
 the word Google and Hotmail.

This top 10 list is based on the volume of searches made over the past year, including the terms typed into Google search - either in the search box on the site or the address bar of a browser.

It gives an indication of which sites were most popular over the course of a year, yet differs from the list of top trending topics.

Trending terms represent spikes in searches for various terms. The number of these searches per spike is compared to other, similar spikes, to determine which were most popular.

These lists form Google's annual round-up called the Zeitgeist list, which highlights the most searched-for people, questions, events, songs,
 and more of the past 12 months.

According to this list, the most popular trending search of 2013 was for Paul 
Walker, the American actor, who was killed in a car crash in 30 
November.

Mr Walker was listed above Apple’s 
iPhone 5S, the royal baby Prince George, the UK government's Universal 
Jobmatch site and Microsoft's Xbox One.

In
 the days following his death, interest in Nelson Mandela caused a surge
 in searches to send him to sixth on the chart of trending terms in the 
UK, and he topped the list of global searches.

Paul Walker, pictured left, the movie star who died in a car crash in November, has come top in Google UK's Zeitgeist top trending search terms for 2013. Interest in Nelson Mandela, right, following his death earlier this month sent him to sixth on the UK chart of trending terms, and he topped the list of global searches

The top trending ‘What is’ query was ‘What is twerking?’, fuelled by Miley Cyrus’ performance on this year’s VMAs in August. 

‘What is my IP’, which stands for Internet Protocol and is the address used by computers to access the web, and ‘What is YOLO’, the acronym for You Only Live Once were second and third.

London mayor Boris Johnson topped the chart of trending politicians, ahead of Nick Clegg and David Cameron.

Boyband One Direction appeared above Justin Bieber, who normally takes the top spot, and Miley Cyrus in the list of most searched celebrities, yet the top place went to Kim Kardashian.

In 2013 she got engaged to Kanye West and gave birth to a son called North.
