Mario Balotelli has posted an Instagram photograph of himself brandishing a shotgun, with a caption underneath that reads 'big kiss to all the haters'. 

The 23-year-old Italian striker later deleted the post. 

The incident is the latest in a long history of controversies involving Balotelli, who in 2011 during his time at Manchester City was caught throwing darts at a youth team player.

In the same year, former Chelsea defender Ashley Cole was forced to apologise to Tom Cowan, a sports science student on work experience at Chelsea's Cobham training ground, for shooting him with a air rifle.

New AC Milan coach Filippo Inzaghi hopes the criticism Balotelli faced recently will help him grow as a player.

Balotelli was the target of more blame than most players for Italy's first-round elimination from the World Cup, and also had an up-and-down campaign with Milan last season despite leading the club with 14 goals in 30 appearances.

Balotelli is currently on holiday in Miami with fiance Fanny Neguesha after Italy crashed out of the World Cup in the group stages. Balotelli scored the winner in a 2-1 win for Italy against England on June 15.  

'I spoke with Balotelli after Italy's exit and I told him that the criticism should serve only to strengthen him,' Inzaghi said on Thursday at a festive preseason training kickoff event at the club's new downtown headquarters. 'I didn't have everything served to me on a silver platter during my career; unfair criticism helped me.'

Balotelli has four years left on his contract at Milan but had been linked with a return to the English Premier League - with Arsenal reportedly interested - until Italy's flop in Brazil.

'Balotelli is an asset for Italian football,' Inzaghi said, noting that the forward asked for a physical trainer to accompany him during his last week of vacation. 'It's my job to get the most worth out of him. He can create the difference for us.'

The Italian striker is currently in negotiations with his ex-girlfriend Raffaella Fico for the right to visit their child, called Pia, who is eighteen months old.

Ballotelli did not acknowledge he was Pia’s father until February this year after DNA tests proved his paternity.

He was allowed to hold her for the first time in April in the court house in Naples, after the judge granted special permission.

Balotelli and Miss Fico attended a private hearing at a court in Brescia, near Milan, in May to discuss how often the footballer will be able to visit his daughter.
