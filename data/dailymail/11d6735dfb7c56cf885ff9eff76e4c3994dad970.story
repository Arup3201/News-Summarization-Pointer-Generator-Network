A mother and her youngest child were discharged on Wednesday from a Nevada hospital a day after being rescued with four other family members who were stranded for two days in a bitter cold mountain wilderness when their Jeep rolled over.

The father of the girl and three other young members of the couple's families were also doing 'remarkably well' but will remain a bit longer for observation at the hospital in Lovelock, Dr Douglas Vacek said.

Some suffered from slight exposure and dehydration, but none had frostbite.

'We were obviously braced for much worse considering the cold,' the doctor said.

The family-of-six had been 
pictured arriving at hospital after they were found alive, huddled in 
their overturned jeep in the frigid Nevada mountains.

James
 Glanton, 34, his girlfriend Christina McIntee, 25, and four children - a
 10-year-old, two four-year-olds and a three-year-old - were discovered 
on Tuesday afternoon in a canyon having miraculously survived the 
dangerous days-long ordeal.

The
 family headed to Seven Troughs, near their home of Lovelock, to play in
 the snow on Sunday but failed to return sparking a massive aerial and 
ground search.

Finally, rescue crews, guided in part 
by cellphone signals and footprints in the now, spotted them through 
binoculars in nearby Trinity Canyon near the overturned vehicle.

'They stayed together and that was the key that allowed them to live through this experience. You don't see that that often in search and rescue,' said Paul Burke, search-and-rescue coordinator for the state.

'They did some pretty unusual things, heating up rocks and things. Staying together, that was a big deal.'

The 34-year-old mine worker and hunter built a fire just minutes after the Jeep rolled down a snowy embankment on Sunday and kept the flames going until rescuers found them on Tuesday, Vacek said.

'I think that really prevented any serious medical problems,' said Dr Vacek, who also praised the group for staying together.

Their Jeep had overturned just off a road. A member of the rescue team said the engine would no longer start, but the group stayed in the upside-down vehicle for shelter, burning the spare tire to keep warm.

'Their father kept them alive and well,' said Patty Bianchi, CEO of Pershing General Hospital, where the six were taken. 'Everybody is in good shape. There was no frostbite. They are stable. They suffered a little exposure and dehydration, but that is all.'

Two of the children belong to the adults,
and one is a niece and one is a nephew, according to the Pershing 
County sheriff's office. They were identified as Evan Glanton, Chloe 
Glanton, Shelby Fitzpatrick and Tate McIntee.

'The mood where I'm at's ecstatic,' said Col. Tim Hahn, who commands the Nevada Wing of the Civil Air Patrol, which had six planes searching for the group. 'We are thrilled beyond words.'

Amanda Fitzpatrick, whose daughter Shelby was among the missing, said the experience had been 'heartwrenching'.

'It's been extremely hard, probably the hardest 24 to 36 hours of my life,' she told CNN. 'It's my baby girl.'

A
 rescue mission searching for the family and their 2005 Jeep was 
launched
 shorty after 8pm on Sunday. As many as 200 volunteers braved the 
freezing temperatures to comb through 6,000 square miles of snow-covered
 mountains.

Spotted: The family took off from Lovelock last week and were found in Trinity Canyon two days later

Navy 
search-and-rescue team and the Civil Air Patrol, an all-volunteer 
auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, assisted the sheriff's office by 
searching a concentrated area. On Tuesday, more planes were sent to 
search - but in fact it was the ground crew who spotted the family.

Rescuers were particularly concerned as temperatures were expected to drop below zero today after plunging to minus-16 degrees on Monday.

It had been unclear what supplies the family might have been carrying and they had not been in communication since Sunday. The area has
 spotty cell phone coverage, authorities said.

Vehicle: They headed out in a silver Jeep with a black roof which rescuers hoped to spot from the sky

Biting: The area is covered in snow and suffering sub-zero temperatures, which made the search urgent

The
 Seven Troughs area is named after a series of seven parallel canyons 
below Seven Trough Peak - elevation 7,474 feet - in the Kamma Mountains 
stretching north across the Pershing-Humboldt county line.

It's
 about 20 miles northwest of where Lovelock sits on Interstate 80 and 
about 20 miles southeast of the Black Rock Desert, where the annual 
Burning Man counterculture festival is held.

'It's
 remote, and it's rocky,' Nevada Department of Wildlife spokesman Chris 
Healy said. 'There are good dirt roads into the place, but they are dirt
 roads, and it is cold and snow so it's not ideal.'

Healy said Seven Troughs is a popular area for hunting chukars, a pheasant-sized winter game bird.

'So
 it's not the kind of area where there would be nobody around,' he said 
Monday. 'But most chukar hunters are smart enough not to go out in the 
weather we have now.'
