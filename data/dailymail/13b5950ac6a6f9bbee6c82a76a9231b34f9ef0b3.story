Amir Khan has solved his US visa problems and is flying to take his seat at ringside for Floyd Mayweather’s Saturday re-match with Marcos Maidana.

Britain’s two-time world champion will land in Las Vegas just in time to hurry to the MGM Grand Garden Arena, where he expects Mayweather to successfully parry Maidana’s macho-man charge once again.

Khan was turned back at Manchester airport on Thursday as he tried to check in for a Virgin Atlantic fight, probably because he was mistakenly flagged up on a watch-list.

Amir  Khan will be all smiles after securing his visa to travel to the US to watch the big fight on Saturday

Amir Khan expressed his disappointment on Twitter after his visa for the US was rejected

It appeared his Moslem name and frequent trips to Pakistan had confused American immigration officials who initially approved his working visa application.

Lawyers in London and Los Angeles hurriedly secured clearance for his visit.

Khan appearance here will enable him to continue pressing Mayweather to make good on his promise that they will meet in the ring before Mr Money retires at the end of next year. One powerful plank in that argument is that he has defeated Maidana.

Although Maidana dragged Mayweather into a brawl in May, Khan says: ‘I expect Floyd to make the necessary adjustments this time and leave Maidana chasing shadows.’

Khan will fly on to San Francisco on Monday to begin training for a fight on December 6, probably in America. One possible opponent is former champion Josesito Lopez who had a good win in Vegas on Thursday night.

Khan will again be working with his US trainer Virgil Hunter, who says: ‘A Khan-Mayweather fight can still happen and I still believe Amir’s speed will trouble Floyd more than anything he has faced in his recent.

Had Khan not been cleared to travel he would have been left to watch Mayweather-Maidana – along with most British fight fans – on BoxNation’s exclusive late night transmission

 Floyd Mayweather v Marcos Maidana will be televised live on BoxNation on Saturday night.
