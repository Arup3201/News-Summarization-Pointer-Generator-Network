The teacher who was sent to prison after he eloped to France with his teenage pupil has written a letter from his jail saying he will not leave her and that being without her is 'torture'.

Jeremy Forrest, 31, sent the seven-page missive to a newspaper saying that him being banned from contact with the 16-year-old, whom he describes as 'remarkable', is a breach on his human rights.

Details of his emotional letter came as it was reported that the girl had written to the maths teacher in prison to say she wants them to be reunited on his release.

The 16-year-old is said to have sent Jeremy Forrest ‘warm, caring and supportive’ letters making it clear she wants to restart their relationship when he has served his five-and-a-half-year sentence for abducting her.

Forrest's handwritten letter was sent to the Daily Express, and is the first time he has made contact with anyone outside his family since he was jailed.

It says: 'The reason why contact is so vital to us is because of the support and stability our relationship gives our lives.

'She is the most remarkable person I have ever met and the strength she continues to show is nothing short of amazing.

'I will not abandon her.'

Forrest says in the letter that he only agreed to face sex charges on condition that he would be allowed to write to and receive letters from the girl.

But the maths teacher, whose wife left him after his betrayal, says he was not allowed to read the letters from her, and has been transferred to tough Dartmoor Prison after making a complaint, it  was reported.

The girl’s desire for a reunion would be a change of heart – four months ago it emerged she had found a boyfriend her own age and was said to have ‘moved on’.

The girl, who triggered an international hunt when she fled to France with Forrest aged 15 and tried to start a new life with him, is said to have written three ‘love notes’ to him.

‘They are about wanting to be with him,’ a source told The Sun. ‘They are warm messages to him. They’re not dumping letters. She wants to continue a relationship with him.’

The paper said Forrest had called for an investigation into whether bosses at Ashfield prison near Bristol had broken rules by refusing to let him read them.

He is said to have demanded to know if officials had carried out the risk assessment that is required before prisoners are banned from having contact with their victim.

After the row, he was told last month that he would be transferred to the forbidding environment of Dartmoor Prison, it was reported.

‘Jeremy just wants to be in contact with her again – he still cares for her,’ the source told the paper.

‘Jeremy’s family believe he has been moved because he demanded to see personal details held on him, which he thinks will show if the assessment happened.’

They are said to fear that his relocation, more than 200 miles from the girl and his own family, will hamper his rehabilitation, including ending his efforts to retrain as a chef because Dartmoor does not have the facilities.

Forrest, who taught at Bishop Bell School in East Sussex, first kissed the girl when she was 14. The pair had sex after she turned 15.

When police were alerted they fled to France by ferry, travelling under false names. He was spotted and arrested eight days later. Last June at Lewes Crown Court he was convicted of sex offences and abduction, and jailed.

Afterwards the girl said: ‘I love Jeremy so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with him and maybe once he’s out, we can marry and have children.’

But social workers have banned her from having contact with him until she turns 18.

The Prison Service said it did not comment on individual inmates.
