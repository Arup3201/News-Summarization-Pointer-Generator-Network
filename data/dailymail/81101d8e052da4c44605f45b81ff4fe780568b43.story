A father battered senseless by a man who taunted his daughter has angrily condemned British 'joke justice' after prosecutors let his attacker off with just a £400 fine.

Supermarket worker David Tait, 42, was beaten up and suffered multiple injuries to his face when he confronted a young man for insulting his 16-year old daughter Faye.

Father-of-three Mr Tait suffered a fractured cheek, broken nose and had to have a metal plate inserted under his right eye socket with doctors warning he might be left partially sighted.

Andrew Copland, who was fined £400 for 'insulting' David Tait, 42, after a new charge was agreed ahead of a planned trial at Bradford Crown

Police who watched CCTV of the attack and took photos of the victim's injuries later charged Andrew Copland, 20, with causing grievous bodily harm.

If convicted, he could have faced five years in jail.

But without Mr Tait's knowledge Copland was offered a new charge ahead of the trial at Bradford Crown Court, West Yorkshire.

It was agreed he could admit a watered-down offence of 'using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour' towards the victim.

Mr Tait then got a letter from a Crown Prosecution Service lawyer informing him of the result: 'The public order charge better reflects the evidence in the case.

'CCTV footage does not show who struck the first blow or how many blows were struck. I know that you may be disappointed with the decision - the courts have an even higher standard of proof than the test I have applied.'

The letter also claimed an 'independent witness' gave a statement which supported Copland's account.

But Mr Tait, from Baildon Green, in Shipley, said: 'If this is British justice then it is a joke. The horrific injuries I suffered left me looking unrecognisable and doctors told me I was very close to losing sight in one of my eyes.

'The police had CCTV of the incident too which clearly shows him knocking me to the ground. What more evidence do you need?

Mr 42, was beaten up and suffered multiple injuries to his face when he confronted a young man who had earlier taunted his 16-year old daughter Faye and left her in tears as she browsed around a market hall

Mr Tait said he saw Copland (pictured) after the conviction and 'he was laughing at me'

'The doctors said if I had taken two more punches I wouldn't be here today. How can anyone conclude that what happened to me is insulting behaviour?'

The incident occurred last November after Faye had gone to the German markets in Leeds with friends. She bumped into Copland - a near-neighbour - and shortly afterwards she rang home in tears claiming he subjected her to a string of insults.

Mr Tait said: 'My daughter was really really upset. She said Copland had come up to her and said things like 'you are a slag', 'your mum is a fat bitch' and all kinds of horrible things.

'I just told her to get herself to the train station and come on home and we will pick her up.'

He later had an exchange of phone calls with Copland which led to a confrontation at a nearby ASDA car park. CCTV showed the two men facing each other before Mr Tait was knocked to the ground and beaten. The footage then showed Copland and a friend running off.

Mr Tait, who still suffers from tingling numbness on the right side of his face and experiences double vision, said: 'I just remember he came for me and I went to block him in self defence.

'Then I remember him pummeling my face, punch after punch - it was unrelenting. The next thing I knew was waking up in hospital.

'We were ready to claim justice for what had happened. Not only was my daughter and wife traumatised after seeing me like that but I am still suffering.

'We just couldn't believe it when the letter arrived saying he got off. It came right out of the blue. Surely in a justice system the victims should be consulted first if they are going to let someone off who has been charged.

'I was told not to bother get my own solicitor because the CPS was there for us. Yet the CPS never rang us to tell us they had accepted this change of plea. I wish I had got my own lawyer now.

'It just seems the CPS just wanted a conviction and it does not matter what they get. It is just about ticking boxes. When I spoke to them they just said 'this is the decision we came to, we have a conviction and he has been charged'.

'But he wasn't charged for any assault whatsoever. I was just doing what any normal dad would do. I saw Copland after the conviction and he was laughing at me.

'I asked him if it was funny that I was two punches away from death and he got a £400 fine. He just replied, 'I am laughing aren't I?''

Mr Tait's wife Marcia, 41, said: 'When I first went to hospital the injured man lying in his bed didn't look like my husband at all. He was beaten to a pulp and initially I thought he was dead. He was unconscious and there was blood absolutely everywhere. '

She added: 'I remember there were police outside his hospital room and they said "don't worry we are only here if things turn south".

'Why would they say that if they didn't think it was serious. It seems you can go around beating up people and leaving them for dead and get fined £400. What lesson does that leave?'

A CPS spokesman said: 'We have written to the victim to explain the reason behind the decision made in this case, and a Senior Crown Prosecutor has also spoken with Mr Tait. We are more than happy to discuss the matter further with Mr Tait if this would be of assistance.'

The CPS also said a complaint procedure is available to Mr Tait and he should contact his Victim Liaison officer if he wanted to pursue it. 

Copland was unavailable for comment.
