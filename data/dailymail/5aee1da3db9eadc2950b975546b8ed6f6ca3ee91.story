'Found': Nelson's Column in central London showing the Lord Admiral with his sword

Lord Nelson's sword is hidden in a ship wreck 500ft below the surface of the Mediterranean sea, an explorer has claimed.

Diver Mark Ellyatt says that he discovered the weapon in the ruins of HMS Victoria, which sank off the coast of Lebanon in 1893.

The sword is said to have been among a haul of Nelson memorabilia that belonged to Vice Admiral George Tyron.

Collectors could pay up to £1m for the artifact  - which is the same one that the Naval Lord shown holding on Nelson's Column in central London.

However, there are concerns about who would claim ownership of the sword if it is recovered from the sea.

Mr Ellyatt said he found the sword in Tryon's cabin which had an adjoining cupboard  containing a number of items that belonged to Nelson.

'The MoD wanted to know the whereabouts of anything to do with Nelson. They didn't want it appearing on auction websites,' Mr Ellyatt told the Telegraph.

'They were very interested in the sword but seemed to get cold feet when I offered to bring it up for them. I don't want people to go and strip the ship bare.

'I would like to bring the sword to the surface but I worry that it would be seized by the local authorities. If the items are to be recovered, I would like to see them end up in a museum in the UK.'

Mr Ellyatt said that he has hidden the weapon inside the wreck to protect it from looters.

He will give more details about the discovery at the International Shipwreck Conference in Plymouth this week.

He added: 'The cabin is a bit like a shrine, with all kinds of nice things hanging off the walls. 'There seem to be a lot of things which are older than the ship itself.'

Vice Admiral Tryon is known to have been an enormous admirer of Lord Nelson, who died 88 years earlier. He is understood to have kept a large number of items on board HMS Victoria that once belonged to his hero.

The prospect of a valuable haul beneath the waters was given more credit last week by the family of Tryon. The vice admiral's great-great grandson Charlie Tryon said they did not now posses any items of Nelson memorabilia.

Since the wreck was discovered in 2004, several items have been brought to the surface including a model of Nelson's HMS Victory. A sword belonging to Nelson was sold at an auction in 2002 for £336,650.

Victor Sharman, a former chairman of the Nelson Society, said that there would be a 'big market' if ay pieces were recovered from the ship.

Christian Francis, a member of the team that found the shipwreck, said that he has declared the find to the British embassy in Lebanon.

An MoD spokesman said that the Royal Navy would 'welcome' any information about Lord Nelson.

The sinking of HMS Victoria came during training exercises for a fleet of 11 warships in June 1893. The conditions were calm and warm. Crowds watched from the shore.

However, as the fleet steamed forward in two parallel columns, Tryon ordered his ship - the HMS Victoria - and the other ship at the head of the column - HMS Camperdown - to perform a dangerous manoeuvre.

Depsite pleas from other officers, the two ships were both ordered to turn inwards. They collided and the  HMS Victoria sank.

Tryon's last words as he went down with his ship were: 'It's all my fault'. The vessel was lost as well as 358 sailors.

His ghost was said to have appeared the same evening at a party being thrown by his wife in London.
