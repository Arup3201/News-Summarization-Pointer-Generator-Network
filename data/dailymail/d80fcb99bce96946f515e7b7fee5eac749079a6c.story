A police chief was suspended for having a steak meal in a restaurant attached to a strip club.

Mark Kizer was accused of violating city policy by attending a gentlemen’s club while on official business.

He was accused of putting in a 'questionable' receipt for a meal that led to his unpaid suspension as head of police for the town of Bryant in Arkansas.

The receipt for $58 seen here and labeled, 'O.C. Food and Beverage' is known by Orlando resident's as the popular gentlemen's club Rachel's

Kizer had been attending a conference in Orlando,Florida, when he had the $58 meal with a colleague.

Kizer submitted the receipt to the town council officials on his return from the conference in July

The receipt was for OC Food and Beverage - but officials found out the restaurant was attached to a strip club.

Town council officials discovered the meal was at an up market gentlemen's club called Rachel's, a well known venue in Orlando.

Strip house or strip club?: Mark Kizer is suspended after turning in the $58 steak meal receipt to the Arkansas police department for reimbursement

Although the restaurant is separate from the strip club guests are still able to see the stage and the nude dancers.

Kizer denied seeing any women while having his meal at the Orlando club.

He said he had visited the steakhouse at the recommendation of his hotel concierge and told colleagues it was 'less provocative than Hooters.'

Kizer insisted he was in the dining hall and his server was a middle aged man who is identified on the receipt as David.

Arkansas police are investigating Kizer's claim that he merely ordered steak and a potato and that he didn't view naked dancers during dinner

He also said the only thing he purchased was a steak and potato.

Kizer and colleague Lee Ledbetter were in Orlando to attend a conference on school security.

But after officials found out the meal was at a strip club after Kizer submitted the bill for reimbursement they launched an investigation.

The town council's human resources looked into the bill and the city attorney says regardless of what actually happened inside the building, it may come down to appearances.

'Just a matter of what the image of it looks like. Obviously, it's significant enough that it's a personnel matter so we're looking at it,' said  Chris Madison.

After an investigation the Mayor of Bryant decided to suspend Kizer for five days without pay because of the 'questionable' purchase at the out of state conference.

A local lawyer later sent Kizer a check for the meal and a further $100 to make up for his loss of pay while on suspension.

Rachel's is a well-known strip club in Orlando, Florida and nude dancers can be observed from the main room or the dining room where Kizer ate dinner
