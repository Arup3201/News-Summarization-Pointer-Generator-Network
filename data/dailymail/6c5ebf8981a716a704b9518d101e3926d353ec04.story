The former London home of a German diplomat which was destroyed by the Nazis during the war has been brought back to life as a £40million mansion.

Lion Lodge is believed to be the first new mansion built in Belgravia in almost 70 years and is thought to be one of the most expensive new homes in Britain.

It has been in built at Eaton Place, on the site of a Thomas Cubitt-designed property, which was bombed in 1940 during the Blitz.

The stunning seven-bedroom home is the first new mansion in Belgravia for almost 70 years and has been put on the market with a guide price of £40million. One of its bathrooms is pictured above

The home had been the London residence of Dr Harald Bielfeld, First Secretary of Commerce in the German Embassy, who from 1936 reported to ambassador Joachim Von Ribbentrop, a favourite of Adolf Hitler.

But in 1939 their diplomatic delegation departed and Lion Lodge was left vacant - only for the Germans to destroy it during a bomb raid the following year.

After the war, another home was built in its place, but after a long planning battle it was knocked down and replaced by the new Lion Lodge.

This makes it the most expensive new home in London's West End. Stamp duty on a £40million home is £2.8million, but council tax is just £2,143 per year.

The property features a number of luxury bathrooms, such as the one pictured, and has been described as a 'magnificent new classical mansion'

Spread over more than 9,000 sq ft, Lion Lodge has a grand entrance hall, three reception rooms, study, guest cloakrooms, passenger lift, media room and leisure complex with private swimming pool, gym area and changing rooms. There are seven bedrooms, with the master suite boasting his and hers bathrooms.

Lion Lodge is on the market with Beauchamp Estates, with boss Gary Hersham describing it as a 'magnificent new classical mansion'.

He said: 'Eaton Place is one of the grandest streets in Belgravia, a highly sought after address by discerning buyers from around the world.

'The site at Eaton Place has come full circle over its history.

'Once occupied by Lion Lodge, one of Cubitt's elegant "lost mansions", lost to WWII bombing, it is now the site of a magnificent new classical mansion that Cubitt would have surely been proud to see returned to the property.

'It is one of the very few examples - I believe even the only true example - of a completely new mansion to be built in Belgravia since 1945.' 

The original home in Eaton Place was built between 1826-1828 and designed by Thomas Cubitt and his brother Lewis.

It is thought the first occupants were relatives of the Marquess of Londonderry, the Marquess living at nearby No.76 Eaton Place.

The house was then occupied by various merchants and members of the aristocracy, before it became a residence for German diplomats.
