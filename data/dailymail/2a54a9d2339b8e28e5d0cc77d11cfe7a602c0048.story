Glorious Great Britain was hotter than Barcelona yesterday as swathes of the country basked in dazzling sunshine.

And the good news from the forecasters was that there’s more to come today, which could be the hottest day of the year so far.

But while that was given a warm welcome by those preparing for a weekend at the beach, it left exhibitors at Chelsea Flower Show in a cold sweat – as gardeners took desperate measures to prevent their prized plants from wilting.

Makeshift tents and gazebos were 
hastily erected to provide shade, with other anxious exhibitors 
resorting to bizarre methods involving coffee cup holders and kitchen 
roll to save their flowers from blooming too early  before the Queen’s 
visit tomorrow.

Exhibitor Andrew Wilson, 54, from Chiswick, was nursing his peonies by wrapping cardboard cup holders around them.

He said: ‘We are hoping that will keep them. They are in danger.

‘As soon as they start to open, we’ve lost them. I don’t want it to get any hotter.’

In
 the Help for Heroes plot, kitchen roll was loosely tied around the Iris
 Germanica Actress flowers to save them from blooming too soon.

years.

year, which is about 17 or 18C (64F).

‘Unfortunately it’s a different story for the North-West and Scotland, which will experience cloudy weather and even some rain.’

Tomorrow and Tuesday will be more unsettled with some sun, showers in parts and cloud in the north.

Society’s elite show for the first time, said last night: ‘I’m on edge. 
We’ve had a warm spring and all our plants are three weeks ahead.

‘I’m
 really worried about my viburnums. They are already in flower and I 
want them to keep the flowers so I have to keep the sunlight off.’

Mr
 Childs’ garden cost more than £100,000 to create, and he added: ‘We’ve 
been nurturing all the plants since October. They are so precious to me 
and I really can’t just let the elements go and destroy them now.’
