An 11-year-old girl in Ohio who came out of a coma after listening to Bruno Mars songs throughout her recovery got to meet the singer that doctors say helped save her life.

Zumyah Thorpe, 11, suffered a severe brain injury after a drunk driver slammed into her mother's car last year.

Her pregnant mother and two younger sisters passed away in the horrific accident and Zumyah wasn’t expected to survive.

Zumyah Thorpe, 11, suffered a severe brain injury after a drunk driver slammed into her mother's car last year, but on Saturday night her favorite singer paid tribute to her in front of 20,000 people in Cleveland, Ohio

Nearly 70 percent of patients who are in this same condition do not survive and those who do are often left without the ability to walk, talk or eat on their own.

Doctors have credited Bruno Mars' music with helping Zumyah do all of those things after nurses played his songs to her at the hospital every night.

Zumyah’s grandmother Ronda told WKYC that not long after coming out of the coma she started singing Mars’ hit song (You’re Amazing) Just The Way You Are.

Doctors say this music therapy is what helped Zumyah recover quicker than most, and even start walking again.

Zumyah also had a private meeting with Bruno Mars before his concert in Cleveland when he performed especially for her and then gave her a large teddy and a kiss

‘I am absolutely convinced that singing those Bruno Mars songs and being able to say Bruno Mars is in itself a miracle,’ the girl’s doctor told.

Zumyah had a private meeting with Mars before his concert in Cleveland, Ohio, on Saturday night.

"He gave me this (holding a teddy bear)….a bag with a lot of stuff," said Zumyah afterwards, smiling from ear to ear.

The during the concert in front of 20,000 fans, Bruno jumped off the stage and into the crowd where he embraced Zumyah and sang her favorite song 'Just The Way You Are.'

Fans say he also handed Zumyah his guitar and hat...and there were very few dry eyes in the arena after his special dedication to an amazing young lady.
