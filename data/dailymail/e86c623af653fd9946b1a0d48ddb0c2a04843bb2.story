He was released on bail and is set to appear at Banbury Magistrates' Court on November 24.

Liberty was hit by a by a blue Citroen C2 around a mile from the 1,400 pupil Henry Box School academy secondary school.

Despite efforts to save her, the popular pupil – whose father is a businessman and mother an Oxford University employee – was pronounced dead soon after being taken to hospital.

A 40-year-old man who was walking nearby was also hit and suffered a broken hip.

At the time of the incident, Prime Minister David Cameron, who is the MP for Witney, expressed his condolences on Twitter.

Meanwhile, Sophie Hicks, 14, a friend of the three victims, said she usually accompanied the girls but had stayed at home yesterday because she was ill.

She said of Liberty: ‘She was one of my best friends. It doesn’t quite seem real, I feel numb. I was on the phone to Mercy and she said they couldn’t watch as Liberty was getting CPR. 

After her death, friends left floral tributes on the roadside, close to where the three girls were hit

 Some of the tributes left the scene. One read: 'Liberty Baker, My heart is with you. Rest in Peace xx' 

'I can’t believe she has gone. She was just so lovely. She always put others before herself and she had a great sense of humour.’ 

Liberty lived with parents Paul, 46, and Maureen, 44, and ten-year-old brother Finley in a £250,000 detached home in Witney.

Her father runs an engineering company and her mother describes her employment on Facebook as working at Oxford University’s St John’s College.

A Facebook group was also created in the schoolgirl’s memory.

One friend wrote: ‘Liberty Baker, you were way too young. Heaven’s gained a beautiful angel. RIP.’

Campaigning for a memorial tree in the school grounds, the Facebook group said: ‘Liberty Baker was a beautiful kind person, never sad, always making the people around her happy.’

Pupils at the school were told about the tragedy at a special assembly less than an hour after Liberty died.
