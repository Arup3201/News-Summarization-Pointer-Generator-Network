A beloved retired Philadelphia couple was strangled by two men - one they knew for decades - that the hired to do household chores, authorities said Monday.

Rufus, 79, and Gladys Perry, 66, were killed by Terry Ballard, 26, and 19-year-old Justen Smith, over some money and a gold necklace, police said. The couple had known Ballard since he was a child.

'For it to be someone that they're familiar with, someone that they knew, makes the pain even greater,' said Donald Carlton, the couple's nephew.

The Perrys' lifeless bodies were found early Thursday by daughter Keya Perry in the stairwell of their rowhouse in the city's Strawberry Mansion section. They had abrasions on their faces and necks, Homicide Capt. James Clark said.

'I got a call early this morning from my sister stating that she had seen on the news that dad had died and Gladys,' daughter Renee Ross told WCAU while fighting through tears. 'It was really shocking to me.'

Police believe the couple let in the two men during the day on Wednesday to do odd jobs around their home.

Things went south when Gladys Perry caught one of the suspect trying to take an envelope of cash he found in the kitchen. The envelope contained only $120, according to the Philadelphia Daily News.

He attacked and choked her to death, and her 79-year-old husband was strangled and smothered with a pillow while trying to save her, police said.

Neighbors later told investigators they had seen Ballard and another man in the victims' backyard that day. Officers soon found the suspects and brought them in for questioning.

'They both admitted to their involvement in this brutal and senseless double murder,' Clark said.

Ballard, whose grandmother is a close friend of the Perrys, had recently moved back to the neighborhood after several years away, Clark said. He didn't say how Ballard and Smith, whose hometown is in western Pennsylvania, knew each other.

Rufus Perry had worked for the city Streets Department, where nephew Donald Carlton now serves as deputy commissioner. Gladys, who is listed in public records as Algladis, had worked as a nurse at a local hospital.

The couple kept to themselves but were the rocks of their family â€” always the first to offer financial or emotional support, said Carlton. He thanked neighbors for helping with the investigation despite the city's pervasive no-snitching culture.

'Too often in these cases, people don't speak, they don't want to get involved,' Carlton said. The fact that people came forward is 'a testament to who my aunt and uncle were.'

Ballard and Smith were charged with murder, robbery 
and related offenses. It wasn't clear if they had attorneys.
