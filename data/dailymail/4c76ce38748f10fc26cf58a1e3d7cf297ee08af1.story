Multi-millionaire Ann Romney appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno last night, professing her love for wholesale retailer Costco, gushing, 'we love Costco!'

The wife of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney told the NBC host that the pair regularly visits the chain, where customers can buy any number of products in bulk.

She also said that the election of her husband, a Mormon, would signal that 'prejudices are left behind' just as the election of President Obama had done.

Pride and prejudice: Ann Romney, who appeared Tuesday on the Tonight Show with host Jay Leno, said that having a Mormon president would signal that 'prejudices are left behind'

The mother-of-five took time out of her campaign schedule to speak with the late night talk show host, saying, ‘I love that we have the first African-American president.'

Asked
by Leno to reflect on the significance of the first Mormon president, 
Mrs Romney said she hoped that if her husband were elected, 'We would 
see more of the same, that prejudices are left behind.'

She had said at last month’s Republican National Convention that she had recently purchased an $18 three-pack of Costco Kirkland dress shirts, which Mr Romney wears ‘all the time now.’

Speaking at the RNC, she had said: ‘It’s great. You take a sharp right and you go way down to the back of the store and just shop the outside of the aisles, and boom, boom, boom.’

The Romneys have been criticised as elite. Recently released tax returns from 2011 showed that the couple earned $13.7million last year alone, mostly from investments.

She first spoke of her harrowing ordeal last Friday, when the aircraft she was on filled with smoke.

‘I was just watching a movie, there was a lot of hustle and bustle,’ she said.

The plane’s pilot declared the electrical issue an emergency, and the plane was forced to land. Leno quipped: ‘Being a swing state, of course you picked Denver.’

He also asked about what her husband meant when he told reporters he didn’t know why plane windows didn’t open, which he said was dangerous, because ‘you can’t find any oxygen from outside the aircraft to get in the aircraft.’

Mrs Romney responded that his comment was a joke, and it was simply ‘his way of dealing with the panic.’

The conversation then inevitably segued into the leaked footage from a fundraising dinner, where Mr Romney said his job ‘is not to worry about’ the 47 per cent of Americans who don’t earn enough to pay income taxes and are likely to support President Obama come November.

‘Last week was not a good week,’ she said simply, smiling. ‘You try so hard to get your message out, you don’t like things to get misconceived – we care about the hundred per cent.’

She and Leno also touched on Mrs Romney’s own comments last week, where she told reporters at Radio Iowa, ‘Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it? Get in the ring.’

The grandmother shrugged it off and said, ‘It’s the ups and downs of the campaign.’

The interview took a decidedly more light-hearted feel from there, with Mrs Romney discussing how she and her husband met in high school. 

‘We met at this party,’ she said, ‘and I will tell you, my heart was just like, womp-womp, womp-womp. I mean, for me, it was love at first sight. I think for him too.’

Leno inquired whether her husband has become a better dancer, leading into a clip of a man with Mr Romney’s face superimposed dancing Gangnam-style.

During the interview, Mrs Romney also talked about her struggles with multiple sclerosis (MS), her love of Costco, and what her causes would be as first lady.
