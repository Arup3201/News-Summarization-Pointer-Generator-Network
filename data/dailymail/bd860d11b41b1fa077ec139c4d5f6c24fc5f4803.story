It remained a hidden underwater world for nearly 25 years, but slowly the water around Argentina's 'town that drowned' has started to recede, exposing the ruins that nestle below.

Once a vibrant spa town south of Buenos Aires, Epecuen was flooded nearly three decades ago - the lagoon salt water has left its mark with everything slowly emerging from the flood covered in a silvery-white layer.

The town was flooded without warning after a long period of
 heavy rains finally sent the lagoon bursting over its banks, submerging the small community on 10 November, 1985.

In the 1970s more rain than usual was delivered to the surrounding hills and Lago Epecuen began to swell. In 1985, the salty waters broke through the clay dam, and Villa Epecuen was flooded

The country town, 550 kilometres (340 miles) from the capital was buried beneath 10 metres (30 feet) of water.

The flood barely gave its 1,500 residents time to gather their belongings and flee - stark reminders of daily life remain from the car engines left in the streets to the rusty beds protruding from the water.

'I had a bunch of cats and dogs, and they ran away a couple days before 
the flood and I never saw them again,' Norma Berg, 48, told AFP.

She lived in the town until the flood forced her family to desert their home. 'I think my pets could feel that the water was coming,' explained Ms Berg.

Pablo Novak feeds his wood kitchen at his house. 'I am OK here. I am just alone. I read the newspaper. And I always think of the town's golden days,' he said

Now the water has mostly receded, exposing what looks like a scene from a movie about the end of the world

Since 2009 the level of the water has 
been decreasing, exposing the ruins of this once popular lakeside resort.

The spa town had been a popular tourist designation with 20,000 people paying a visit each year to the lagoon.

The town had 280 businesses, including 
lodges, guesthouses, hotels and businesses, centered around the tourist trade.

Lago Epecuen’s therapeutic powers have been famous for years and the lagoon has a salinity level only topped by the Dead Sea.

It is said that Epecuen — or ‘eternal spring’ —
 can cure conditions such as depression, rheumatism and skin diseases.

A local legend holds that the lake was formed by the tears of a great Chief crying for
 the pain of his beloved.

Even after the flood waters receded and more land was exposed, the town was not rebuilt.

There is now one lone resident in the area, 81-year-old Pablo Novak.

'Until about four or five years after the flood, when the waters were 
still high, nobody came around here at all,' Mr Novak explained.

'I was totally alone. All day, every day.'

He spends his days cycling around the ruins, although more visitors have come to the town recently in an attempt to salvage materials to recycle from the ruins. 

The spooky town has provided the perfect backdrop to several films in recent years.
