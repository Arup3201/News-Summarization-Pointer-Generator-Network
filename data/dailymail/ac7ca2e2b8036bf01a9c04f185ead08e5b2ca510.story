A patient has died on the way to hospital in a police car because there were not enough ambulances to take them.

The death of the unnamed person lead to four officers being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

The incident is part of a growing trend of vulnerable patients being taken to A&E by police officers because of a shortage of ambulances.

Logs kept by Police Federation officials reveal that vulnerable and severely ill patients are being taken to hospital in police cars after ambulances failed to arrive. Four officers were investigated by the IPCC after a woman died while being transported

In another case a 14-year-old girl who had overdosed on diazepam had to be taken to hospital by officers after her parents waited 80 minutes for an ambulance.

Police cars were also used to transport a father who had slit his wrists and was bleeding heavily and a woman who had crashed her car and was having heart palpitations, both in the East of England.

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has criticised Jeremy Hunt for failing to address the crisis

In another case in the South East an officer was disciplined after taking a very sick woman to hospital after no ambulance was available nearby.

The police control room had told the officer not to take the patient, who died but was later revived, and disciplined the officer for misconduct.

The full scale of the crisis has been revealed in incident logs kept by Police Federation officials.

One, in the North East, wrote that 'during a shift of 16 officers, eight were in hospital standing by for around four hours.'

In another statement the official added: 'On Good Friday we were told there is a seven hour waiting time for an ambulance - so don't call one... you won't get one.'

The scandal was uncovered by a Labour probe and shadow Health Secretary Andy Burham blamed Jeremy Hunt for the problems, telling The Observer : 'He has failed to grasp the urgency of the A&E crisis. The chaos is now spreading to other emergency services.

'The alarming fact that police cars are now doubling as makeshift ambulances is a clear sign of how bad things have got on his watch.'

The rising use of police cars being used to take patients to hospital is in part due to the much-criticised 111 phone service leading to more patients calling 999 for help.

The use of police vehicles has been blamed on the shambolic 111 phone service leading to more people calling 999, and more patients walking into A&E to be treated leading to ambulances waiting for doctors to be free

As more desperate patients preset themselves at casualty wards for treatment the ambulances which are available are waiting longer for doctors to become free.

Steve White, Vice-Chairman Police Federation for England and Wales, said: 'Police officers routinely find themselves dealing with medical emergencies, and are placed in positions where they are left with no option but to use police vehicles as makeshift ambulances.

'They are dealing with a variety of casualties, from assault victims to those involved in traffic collisions, and often find themselves waiting for an hour or longer for paramedics to arrive.'

Government cuts to NHS Trusts have also placed a bigger strain upon the ambulance service.

Earlier this year it was reported that the number of patients forced to wait at least two hours parked outside A&E had risen by two-thirds in one year.

Figures from eight of England's 10 ambulance trusts also showed that 3,424 patients waited more than two hours before handover to hospital staff during 2012-13, compared with 2,061 such patients the year before.
