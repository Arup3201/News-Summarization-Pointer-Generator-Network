A 15-year-old boy from New Mexico has been arrested in connection to the murder of his 12-year-old friend found dead in a vacant lot Tuesday.

Albuquerque police say the victim, identified as Alex Madrid, died of severe blunt force trauma.

The suspect, Brandon Villalobos, has been charged with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence.

According to investigators, despite their age difference the two teens had been long-time friends and Madrid's parents knew he was with Villalobos at the time of his death.

The child was reported missing at around 4pm. Police went to Villalobos' home in Meadow Lake, and the 15-year-old led the officers to his friend’s lifeless body dumped in an open field off Meadow Lake Road and Manzano View Drive. 

According to Valencia County sheriff Luis Burkhard, Madrid, a resident of Albuquerque, was in town near Los Lunas to visit family.

The boys, who attended the same school in 2011, had been hanging out together since Sunday.

Madrid's mother called police Tuesday afternoon after failing to reach her son, ABQ Journal reported.

Authorities say Villalobos is being held at the Juvenile Detention Center in Albuquerque.

Police have yet to determine a motive behind the killing.
