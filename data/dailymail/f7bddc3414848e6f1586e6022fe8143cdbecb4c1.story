On camera: Prince William will star in a BBC documentary about helicopter rescues next month

Viewers are to get a close-up look at Prince William at work in his role as a rescue helicopter pilot.

He features in the four-part BBC reality series which starts next month.

Helicopter Rescue follows several search and rescue crews, including those based at RAF Valley on Anglesey where Flight Lieutenant Wales – as the prince is known – is based.

In the first episode, William, 30, will be seen captaining his Sea King helicopter to help save a boy who has fallen into an old slate quarry in Blaenau Ffestiniog.

The unnamed youngster has fallen from an old railway bridge onto an outcrop of jagged rocks below 
when the prince is dispatched to lead the rescue.

Williams, who is part of a four-man crew, is featured speaking on camera describing his role once the call comes in.

He says: 'As captain you’re trying to play out the entire rescue... in your mind and pick up any problems you can foresee, and try and fix them on the ground before you get airborne.'

William adds: 'There’s no greater feeling than when you’ve actually done some good and saved someone’s life. I don’t think there’s any greater calling in life... to be able to see a son or daughter’s face when you bring their mother or father back from the edge of death – it’s quite powerful.'

Winchman and paramedic, Master Aircrewman
 Richard Taylor, also describes just how treacherous rescue work can be,
 as a decision is made that they should winch the casualty on board the 
helicopter on a stretcher as the prince hovers overhead.

Danger: The victim is strapped to the stretcher before being winched back up to Prince William's helicopter

Care: The prince maintains a hovering position as the rescue unfolds below

'It’s a challenging procedure,' he says, 'and inherently dangerous to 
put a man on a very thin piece of wire, hanging underneath nine tons of 
helicopter that’s susceptible to turbulence and problems itself, and may
 have to fly away.'

The series will also show the prince’s day-to-day life at RAF Valley.

A spokesman for the prince said of his 
decision to participate in the four-part fly-on-the-wall show: 'Prince 
William is but one of many participants and his contribution is exactly 
the same as the other pilots.

'He is one of a team, and the team as a 
whole is the subject of the documentary, so it was entirely appropriate 
he took part.'

Palace officials are due to announce within weeks whether he will stay in the RAF after his three-tenure ends this autumn.

It is widely believed that, with his first child due this summer, William will transfer to a role nearer to London.
