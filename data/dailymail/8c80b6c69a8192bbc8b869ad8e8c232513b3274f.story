Shopping in the Chinese city of Shenyang is very similar to shopping anywhere in the world... very similar indeed.

Just pop down to Wanda Square in the heart of the city and you'll see a cornucopia of well-known brands - all with incredible knock-off prices.

Start your spree at HERWES PARIS before heading on to CNANEL for perfume, PRΛDΛ for clothes and Cairter or Tifeany & Co for that jewellery you always wanted.

If wobbly shopping legs begin to take 
hold you can always stop for some ice-cream at Häagen Dezs washed down 
with a skinny latte from Starbocks Coffee.

Knock off prices: Start you spree at HERWES PARIS where you're bound to find a bargain

If you still haven't noticed something suspicious then look again, because the entire street is populated with fake brands based on some of the world's most famous.

A representative from the Wanda group,
 which oversees the square, told Xinhua news agency that the stores were
 'fakes for marketing purposes' only.

That means they were only using the names to draw people in before selling completely different merchandise, Shanghaiist reported.

The street, promoted as a 'European-style pedestrian street', is valued at nearly £5,000 per metre.

It is not the first time China has sought to replicate famous Western towns and landmarks.

Top brands such as Häagen Dazs and Starbucks Coffee both appear to have been imitated on the street

Last year, plans to turn the the 
southern city of Huizhou into a £5.7billion carbon copy of picturesque 
Hallstatt in Austria, complete with artificial lake were leaked to the 
Western media.

Posing as tourists, Chinese officials were have been spotted photographing every building there over the last three years.

The plan was discovered when a Chinese guest at Hallstatt’s hotel left behind a bundle of blueprints.

China already has Chengdu British Town, modelled on Dorchester, and Thames Town, near Shanghai.
