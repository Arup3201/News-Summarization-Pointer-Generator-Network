Around one and a half billion people across the globe are bald or have some form of hair loss.

Now a company in California has come up with what it claims to be the solution - a helmet that fires cool lasers at the wearers scalp to stimulate hair growth.

The Theradome headgear is said to be the only wearable, clinical-strength laser treatment that people can use at home, but it will set buyers back almost $800 (£475).

A Californian company has invented a helmet that fires cool lasers at your scalp to stimulate hair growth. The Theradome laser helmet (pictured) claims to be the only wearable clinical-strength laser treatment that people can use at home

The Theradome claims to reverse the shrinking of follicles using lasers with regular use, up to between 18 and 26 weeks.

The company promises that such dedication results in cleaner, thicker and more manageable hair that is less oily. Hair shafts are larger and there is less fallout in the shower and on pillows.

Between 28 and 52 weeks of use for 20 minutes twice a week, it regrows hair by increasing blood flow to the scalp and hair follicles as well as boosting cell metabolism and reducing the effects of protein blocking enzymes.

In this time, the scalp will be healthier, less itchy and less inflamed, the company said.

After 100 weeks of treatment, hair will be fuller and thicker.

It claims to grow healthy new hair, double the follicle size of existing hair and can even prevent hair loss.

‘Getting your hair back is a convenient and affordable process,’ the company said.

Laser light therapy has been proven to improve hair health, but cold laser therapy has only been available at specialist clinics.

Theradome lets people use this advanced technology at home, and contains high efficiency lasers that produce virtually no heat but allow the maximum amount of light to be delivered, the company claim.

However, the technology comes at a price as the helmet costs $795 (£473 plus shipping).

It contains 80 lasers, so that light can reach 90 square inches (582 square centimetres) of the 111 square inch (720 square centimetre) average scalp area.

Users of the device are meant to wear it for 20 minutes at a time, twice a week.

For the first 18 to 24 weeks of use, it is designed to reverse the shrinking of hair follicles to stop further hair loss.

The helmet (illustrated) claims to set about regrowing hair by increasing blood flow to the scalp and hair follicles, stimulating microcirculation, improving the metabolism of cells and protein synthesis

‘You will find you have cleaner, more manageable hair with improved lustre and fuller body, decreased oiliness and larger hair shafts. You'll also find less hair fallen out in the shower and on pillows,’ the company said.

After 28 weeks of regular wear, the helmet claims to set about regrowing hair by increasing blood flow to the scalp and hair follicles, stimulating microcirculation and improving the metabolism of cells.

It ‘reduces the effects of protein blocking enzymes, promoting thickness and density,’ the company said.

Theradome claims that with regular use for up to 50 weeks, wearers of the laser helmet will have thicker and longer hair, plus a healthier scalp that is less itchy and inflamed.

After 52 weeks, ‘the hairs on the top of the head ... will start filling in. After 100 weeks … fuller and thicker hair will result with continued use,’ the company said.

The helmet was the brainchild of former Nasa scientist Tamim Hamid, who is the founder and chief executive of Theradome.

He wanted to find a way of preventing his own hair loss at the age of 32 without using medication.

He explained the laser helmet can be used alongside other hair restoration treatments and after chemotherapy.

However, one expert from The London Centre of Trichology said that lotions can be much more effective at stimulating blood flow in the scalp than lasers.

While he admitted he had not tried out the Theradome product, he said that he has never seen impressive results from a similar system - whether at home or in a clinic.

Dr Bessam Farjo, Medical Director of the Institute of Trichologists, said: 'I do believe that laser technology has validity, but I’m sceptical of the specific claims made by Theradome GB  that this particular headgear has the ability to increase the hair shaft diameter by 200 per cent. I have not seen any scientific evidence to support this.

'It’s great to see businesses putting resources to the development of this technology, but more scientific results are needed to back-up the huge claims that Theradome is making.'
