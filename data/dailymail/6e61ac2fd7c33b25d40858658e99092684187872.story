Rubble and dust, pigeon droppings, abandoned manuscripts and a lonely mud-splattered grand piano are all that remain beneath the high arches of Christchurch's grand blue-stone Cathedral.

Haunting new photographs from inside the cathedral provide an eerie reminder of the devastation caused by the earthquake that rocked the city in February 2011.

They are among the first photos taken since that day the earth opened-up on New Zealand's south island, bringing down the cathedral spire and ripping a hole in its façade.

The cathedral, at the heart of Christchurch's CBD, was among 1000 other buildings destroyed by the earthquake, which also claimed 185 lives. 

But as the rest of the city rebuilds, the abandoned house of worship -  built between 1864 and 1904 - stands untouched. The Anglican Church wants to see it demolished, while many in the city are lobbying for the structure to be repaired.

A spokesman for the Anglican Diocese told TVNZ the anonymous photographers from the group Urban Explorers carelessly risked their lives, and those that may have had to rescue them, by trespassing in such a structurally dangerous building.

More than three years after the devastating earthquake that rocked New Zealand's south Island, the  nave of Christchurch's once grand old cathedral is filled with nothing but rubble and broken pews

The haunting photos are among the first taken inside the cathedral since the February 2011 earthquake, which killed 185 people and swallowed more than 100 buildings in Christchurch city

Out of tune:  The Cathedral's grand piano sits quiet, covered in mud and bird droppings inside the sanctuary

The 2011 earthquake toppled the Cathedral's spire and ripped a hole in the building's facade

The Anglican church want the ruined Christchurch cathedral pulled down, saying it is  too dangerous to be repaired

Haunting: The photographers had to wait for 'earthquake tourists' to pass before they entered the abandoned cathedral to capture its ruined interiors

The Christchurch earthquake destroyed whole sections of the historic cathedral which was built between 1864 and 1904

For more than three years, the chairs of the ruined cathedral have been left to only pigeons and the elements

Better times: Parts of the cathedral remain intact and many Christchurch residents are lobbying to see it repaired rather than pulled down and rebuilt

Old biblical texts and manuscripts have been left to rot inside the cathedral, which, after suffering initital earthquake damage and aftershocks,  is still considered too dangerous to enter

Last words: There may be no more holy readings from the old Christchurch cathedral, which is slated to be pulled down and rebuilt along with 1000 other collapsed buildings in the city
