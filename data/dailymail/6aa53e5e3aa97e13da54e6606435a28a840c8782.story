Rays of hope were emerging today as the forecast suggested that the worst of the winter weather may finally be over.

Winter Storm Vulcan hit hard on Wednesday across the Midwest and Northeast but by Thursday afternoon snowfall had tapered off.

Snow stopped falling in upstate New York and southern New England this morning while Vermont would see its last flurries late in the afternoon.

The snow was already melting today in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. A winter storm system delivered frigid temperatures to much of western Pennsylvania, but far less snow than was forecast

In Maine, snow would continue into Thursday evening. Snowfall today should be less than an inch in Upstate New York and southern New England, according to the Weather Channel.

Vermont received between one and three inches - dramatically lower than the two feet earlier predicted by forecasters. 

The Northeast would remain blustery and cold but the snow flurries were diminishing by the hour. 

Temperatures would stay around 10F in upstate New York and New England with temperatures up to 30F predicted in Pennsylvania and New Jersey south to the Virginias.

Much of the Midwest was dry on Thursday with isolated rain or snow showers in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and northwest Michigan.

To the relief of those in the region, who have battled one of the hardest winters on record, no significant snow accumulations are expected.

Temperatures peaked in the 30s across the Great Lakes and upper half of the Ohio Valley.  Milder 40Fs and 50Fs were expected from Minnesota southeast to Kentucky.

The weather forecast was dramatically 
different from the heavy snow that pummeled the Midwest and Northeast 
just 20 hours earlier.

On Wednesday, pileups
 on the Ohio Turnpike involving at least 50 vehicles killed three people
 and seriously injured a state trooper.

Emergency 
workers on the busy toll road struggled to reach accidents and stuck 
vehicles because of snowy conditions and traffic backups.

Pileups
 stretched across a 2-mile section in the eastbound lanes of the 
turnpike between Toledo and Cleveland. Another series of pileups about 
10 miles to the east shut down the turnpike's westbound lanes near 
Sandusky.

A trooper responding to an accident was pinned between vehicles, said the Ohio State Highway Patrol, which confirmed the deaths. One vehicle lane opened about four hours after the first accident.

The initial crash involving 16 
vehicles left two people dead: Grzegorz Piwowarczyk, 42, a truck driver 
from Palatine, Illinois; and Hannah Matheny, 20, a passenger in a car 
from Parma, Ohio, the Ohio State Highway Patrol said on Thursday.

A second crash involving about 20 vehicles killed Janice Robb, 66, of Schererville, Indiana, the patrol said.

Trooper
 Andrew Clouser, 29, was in serious but stable condition at a Toledo 
hospital on Wednesday night, said Ohio patrol Staff Lt. Anne Ralston.

Wednesday's
 storm moved east, hitting the Great Lakes in Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
upstate New York and parts of New England before dissipating over Canada.

Meteorologists
had warned that as much as 9 inches of snow could fall in parts of 
southeastern Michigan by Wednesday evening, with 4 to 8 inches in 
Detroit.

Hundreds of schools were closed there, and drivers traversing 
slippery roads fell victim to rear-end collisions, ended up in ditches 
or had other snow-related mishaps.

AAA Michigan said it responded to 900
 calls for help, mostly in the southern part of the state.

The
 picture was similar in upstate New York, where hundreds of schools 
called off classes after the weather service warned that a blizzard with
 winds of up to 50 mph could paralyze the area from western New York to 
the Adirondacks.

Ed 
Szymanski was just finishing his first pass with the shovel outside a 
Buffalo post office when he declared that he'd had enough of winter.

'Too long,' he said of the season as snow hit his eyeglasses and melted into droplets.

The late-winter storm was helping to edge snowfall totals toward the top of the record books.

Totals
 in southeastern Michigan could come close to breaking a 133-year-old 
record.

The storm was likely to move the Detroit area close to the 
seasonal snow total record of 93.6 inches set in 1880-81, the weather 
service said.

Chicago had 
already been buried this winter by 75.5 inches of snow, the fourth most 
on record dating back to 1884-85. Wednesday's snow pushed the seasonal 
total into third place, ahead of the 77-inch total from 1969-70.

After
 a few days of tantalizingly warmer temperatures, the return to 
snow-covered streets and trees was a jarring sight.

Workers in downtown 
Chicago grunted as they heaved slush with well-worn shovels. Others 
rushed to return sidewalk signs warning pedestrians of ice falling from 
skyscrapers.

A tour boat 
company that ferries sightseers along the Chicago River even announced 
it was delaying this weekend's planned rollout of vessels from winter 
storage because they were encased in 20-inch-thick ice. Temperatures 
on Friday are forecast in the 50s.

But there were some gluttons for winter punishment reveling in another blitz of squalling snow. One of them was bookstore owner Ken Peczkowski, of South Bend, Indiana, who was happy to be out shoveling again.

'It
 makes me feel alive,' he said. 'Summer just drags me down. Winter, I 
feel like I have to fight for every day of life, and that's great. It's 
good exercise.'

Peczkowski said he remembers worse winters, including the blizzard of '78, when the city received a record 172 inches of snow.

'We made it through that, too,' he said. 'I think we were open every day.'

Others
 have been searching at least for a feeling of spring, including some 
who stopped to check out the house plants and cheery garden items at 
Jeff Gatewood's nursery in the Indianapolis suburb of Fishers.

'Everybody's
 got so much pent-up energy, it's going to make for a crazy spring,' 
Gatewood said. 'Spring fever is really going to be pretty high this 
year.'
