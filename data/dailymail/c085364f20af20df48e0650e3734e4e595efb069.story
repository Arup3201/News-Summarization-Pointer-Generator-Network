Silhouetted against the sky, teenager Andrew Vasey performs astonishing moves on top of the Sage in Gateshead early this morning.

The 18-year-old was one of ten Parkour runners - also known as free runners - from the north east being filmed by artist Melanie Manchot.

Her project involves capturing the freerunners as they move along the route of the Great North Run.

Parkour is a discipline where practitioners use jumps, flips and twists to move quickly and smoothly between buildings in urban areas.

Daring: Andrew Vasey from Washington, Tyne and Wear, performed a stunning routine on top of the Sage

Silhouette: The 18-year-old free runner is just visible as he performs a handstand on the curved roof of the arts and music centre

Poised: The teenager was performing for a film on Parkour in the north east by artist Melanie Manchot

Mr Vasey showed incredible bravery as he performed handstands on top of the building without wearing a harness.

He used a hatch usually used by window cleaners to access the roof, where he spent two hours running up and down in the morning sunshine.

Commuters on the Tyne Bridge stared 
open-mouthed at the young dare-devil as hecut an unusual sight on the 
roof.An on-looker said: 'It was amazing to see. The guy would surely 
have been killed if he'd fallen off.'

Artist Ms Manchot also ventured onto the roof to film the freerunner for her production, Tracer after the French word traceurs, meaning Parkour runners.

Her project started on the morning of the Bupa Great North Run 2012, whena team from Apeuro Freerunning 
performed in the underpass of the closed central motorway in Newcastle 
city centre.

The artist has also captured freerunners on top of the Newcastle Swing Bridge and the Tyne Bridge Towers.

She said: 'I’m working with a group of local parkour runners to re-imagine the architecture and spaces along the route of the Great North Run through the amazing discipline and philosophy of parkour.

'Through the parkourists’ movements these iconic, atmospheric locations are rearticulated and brought to life in unexpected ways.

'We’re very excited to be able to continue on our path into Gateshead by filming on the roof of The Sage.'

Iconic: The Sage was designed by Norman Foster and is a celebrated part of the Gateshead skyline, although some locals refer to the building as looking like a large slug

Dramatic: Mr Vasey can be seen balanced on top of the Sage, as seen through the Tyne Bridge

Strength: Parkour is a discipline that sees runners move quickly and smoothly from building to building using only their bodies

The Sage was designed by British architect Norman Foster who built 30 St Mary Axe - commonly known as The Gherkin - in London.

Beth Bate, director Great North Run 
Culture which commissioned the project, said: 'We're delighted to be working with Melanie to show the 
course of the Bupa Great North Run in a completely new way.

'Every year we invite artists to apply for our Moving Image Commission 
and every year we’re amazed at the talent and the diversity of ideas out
there.

'Whether they focus on the runners, the elite athletes, the landscape or
its incredible heritage, it seems the Run has the ability to continue 
to inspire artists in new and exciting ways.'

Parkour began in France in the mid 20th 
century and has been popularised in recent years by films such as the 
2006 version of Casino Royale, which featured celebrated freerunner 
Sébastien Foucan in a chase scene.

Tracer by Melanie Manchot will be presented as part of Great North Run Culture’s 2013 programme in September.
