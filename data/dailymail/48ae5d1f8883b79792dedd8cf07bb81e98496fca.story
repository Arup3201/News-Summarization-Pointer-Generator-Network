After 22 minutes and 30 seconds of pure gold in front of a  microphone from Wayne Rooney, the England striker stood up to deliver one final line.

'I'm sure you'll all have your own views as to what to make of that,' he declared after a bravura performance in front of the assembled media.

It is the last we will hear from Rooney before he steps out in the Arena da Amazonia on Saturday evening wearing the No 10 shirt of England.

He spoke with utter conviction.

'I am going to enjoy this tournament because I haven't enjoyed the last ones,' he admitted. 'I'm going to take positive memories.' It all came  tumbling out, just like it did when he visited  England's team psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters. 'Yes, I've been to see him a few times,' he added.

There was no holding back, which is just the way we like it from the man who can turn a game with a swivel of his hips or a ping off that Nike boot. Rooney warmed up by putting away Paul Scholes with a feisty attack, hinting at jealousy after he signed a new five-year contract worth £250,000 a week at Old Trafford. By the end, Rooney was at full throttle.

'He's been a great player at Manchester United, but I've never had his phone number and he's never had mine,' revealed Rooney. Tasty stuff.

'I'm sure he has upset a lot of  people at Man United because they see me worthy of signing a new deal at the club, so obviously they have got a different opinion to what Paul has. The criticism was a bit strange, but he has his opinions and he's entitled to them. It was very, very strange, but I'm sure he has his reasons.

'I don't agree with them, but he's probably the best player I've ever played with so I'm not going to knock him as a player.'

Next up were the Italians. Rooney has played against the great  catenaccio defences in the past for club and country, and is convinced that there is nothing to fear from Juventus pairing Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini.

'If I'm being honest, when you play a high tempo they have  struggled,' he added. 'The Italian league is nowhere near the tempo of the Premier League. Even when we played AC Milan, with Nesta and Maldini as centre halves, they really struggled when we played a high tempo. If we can do that we can give them problems.'

Rooney has convinced himself that this England team is better than the 'golden generation' who reached the quarter-final in 2006  or the decrepit 2010 team beaten  4-1 by Germany in Bloemfontein.

'The Italian players should be looking at us and how they can  control our team,' he added. 'We're not really too focused on Pirlo.

'He has been a fantastic player and Italy have some great players, but so have we.

'They should be more worried about our team. It is exciting and the young players bring a lot of energy and excitement. You can see with Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling that there's no fear with them. They'll be good players, big players for us.

'This is probably the best squad of players I've been involved with since I've been with England.'

That was an extraordinary claim, particularly with so little expectation around this group of players, but at least Rooney believed what he was saying. He was giving the world what they wanted to hear ahead of Saturday's Group D clash.

When the subject of 2010 and the mouthful he gave England fans as he walked off the field at the Green Point Stadium in Cape Town after a 0-0 draw with Algeria came up, he sounded genuinely remorseful.

'Of course I regret it,' he added. 'It was in the heat of the moment. It was stupid of me, I understand that, but it was a frustrating time. 

'I'll do my best for England and I'm sure the fans see that. I'm sure the Manchester United fans who are England fans like me.' The World Cup in South Africa was a traumatic experience for Rooney. 

He admitted he struggled to cope without his family.

'The hardest thing about last time was that I missed my family and this time I've learned to deal with that,' he added. This time they will travel to Brazil to watch Rooney in tournament conditions.

Last month his son Kai was in Portugal with Rooney's father-in-law, Tony, to watch him undergo a rigorous fitness schedule before  the England team met up in the prestigious Vale do Lobo resort.

'He's not a massive football fan to be honest, he's not really into it at the minute,' revealed Rooney. 

'At the end of last season, when I walked out at Old Trafford the fans were shouting my name and he was asking why.'

Young Kai, who is only four, will discover in time that his dad remains one of the biggest talents in English football. Rooney's edge is back, the element of aggression that set him apart when he emerged at Everton and embedded himself in the English game.

'David Moyes didn't call me - I went to see him,' Rooney explained. 

'He gave me his honest  opinion and he felt I had lost a bit of aggression, which I was asked to do (by Sir Alex Ferguson).

In doubt: Rooney's place in England's starting line-up at the World Cup has been questioned

'I thought about it and it wasn't really me. I've always responded well in the dressing room if I'm not doing well. If someone shouts at me I have no problem with that.'

Rooney has done so much in his career, winning five Premier League titles and the Champions League with Manchester United.

Incredibly, he has yet to score at a World Cup.

'If you look at my record in the World Cup qualifiers I had a pretty good record (seven goals).

'That's what I have to do at the World Cup. I want to score goals and help England be successful, but I honestly feel better than I have done for years.

'I'm ready for this tournament and I know if I play my game I will do well.'

Doing well here means supplying goals and scoring them as England negotiate a tricky group involving Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica.

Although Rooney is yet to get off the mark at a World Cup, he is one goal behind equalling Michael Owen (40 goals) and 10 behind the great Sir Bobby Charlton in an England shirt.

'At my age I should break the record, but I just want to keep  playing and trying to score. If I can get to Sir Bobby's record it would be a massive achievement and I would be absolutely delighted.'

When he gets there, everyone will have a view on it.
