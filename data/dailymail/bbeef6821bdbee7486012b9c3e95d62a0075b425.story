This is the horrifying moment gangsters chased and killed an innocent 17-year-old student after mistaking him for a rival gang member.

CCTV footage shows victim Kwame Ofosu-Asare who was 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' running away from Nelson Idiabeta, then 17, and Nathaniel Okusanya, then 18.

Moments after the teenagers were captured running after him and a friend, Kwame was stabbed 14 times in the back in a 'cowardly and merciless'
murder.

The 17-year-old was mistaken for a rival in a 'poisonous and senseless' gang war, a court heard today as Idiabeta and Okusanya were jailed for life.

The pair were members of the TN1 gang -
Trust No One - out to avenge one of their numbers who was stabbed by a 
rival gang member from the GAS gang - Guns and Shanks - just hours 
earlier.

His killers had toured housing estates
in Brixton to find rival gang members and came upon the 17-year-old son
of a sports broadcast journalist and his friend, who had nothing to do 
with any gangs.

CCTV footage shows Kwame Ofosu-Asare, in front of a friend, sprinting away from a pair of gangsters who were touring housing estates in Brixton to take revenge for one of their own being stabbed

Nathaniel Okusanya and Nelson Idiabeta are also picked up on the footage as they chase Kwame, who they mistook for members of a rival gang. When they caught up with him, they stabbed him 14 times in the back

Kwame, a business student, promising 
footballer, a budding actor and rapper, was walking back with a friend 
from a session at a recording studio when they were confronted by 
Okusanya and Idiabeta in the Moorlands Estate in Brixton.

Kwame and his friend with a 'sixth 
sense' ran away into a cul de sac where his friend’s aunt lived in a 
desperate attempt to get to safety - but she was not at home.

His friend managed to jump over a wall but Kwame was trapped and then killed on March 2 of this year.

He shouted out he was from Catford and pleaded 'I’m not from round here, I’m not from round here' but
he was murdered by the pair who had persuaded a shopper
to buy them at least one substantial kitchen knife just hours before 
the attack.

After an Old Bailey jury found the 
pair guilty Nelson Idiabeta, now 18 was jailed for a minimum of 19 years
while Nathaniel Okusanya, 19, was jailed for 20 years.

Sentencing Judge Richard Marks QC 
said: 'I am entirely satisfied having heard the evidence the background 
to this terrible offence is to be found in revenge between two gangs.

'Around 1.15pm Garfield Stewart a 
member of TN1 gang was stabbed 28 times while sat in a bus while it was 
stationary at West Norwood.

Nelson Idiabeta, left, and Nathaniel Okusanya, right, of the Trust No One gang, were today jailed for 19 and 20 years respectively for the murder. Neither have shown an iota of remorse, said the judge

Kwame, a budding rapper, had been walking back from a recording studio when his assailants struck - he sought shelter at the home of his friend's aunt in a nearby cul-de-sac but tragically she was not home

'It’s clear from the evidence a very 
short time from that stabbing you found out about it and decided this 
stabbing needed to be avenged.

'Your purpose was to carry out an attack on a GAS gang member and anyone you believed to be so.

'You encountered two boys Kwame and 
his friend by reason of they only being on the Moreland Estate.

'You 
believed them to be GAS gang members, they were not and have no 
connection whatsoever with this gang.'

He said Kwame’s friend managed to escape but Kwame 'was not so fortunate'.

'He was heard to shout "I’m from 
Catford" saying to you he was in effect not from around there and had no
reason to be chased. It was to no avail.

'He was violently attacked suffering 14 stab wounds, three of which penetrated his lungs and one his liver.

'It would have been abundantly obvious to you he was gravely injured but you ran off thinking only of your escape.'

He added: 'It was Kwame's misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.'

But Judge Marks added Idiabeta, who was on bail at the time for robbery, and Okusanya 'have shown no an iota of remorse.'

Crispin Aylett QC, prosecuting, told 
jurors: 'Kwame's death was but a part of a poisonous and senseless feud 
between two rival gangs of youths in south London.'

Judge Marks said Kwame’s father, a 
sports presenter in Ghana, described his son as 'vibrant, energetic, 
enthusiastic and promising boy.'

The father, in a statement read to 
the court, added: 'Hours before his 
horrendous death he had gone to the studio to record a track which he 
dedicated to his mother.

‘The sudden and tragic death of Kwame 
has deprived us of a brother, son and friend.

'He is ever present in our 
minds. The damage Kwame’s death has caused the family is irreparable. 
Our lives have been ruined and will never be the same again.’

He was in the sixth-form of Forest 
Hill School, had moved from Ghana to London in 2002, and excelled in sport, music and acting and had great 
ambitions to make something of his life.

Idiabeta, who was living at a bail hostel 
in Camberwell,  had been in youth court 
on the morning Kwame was stabbed for breaching his bail conditions for 
robbery but the prosecution could not find his file so the case was 
adjourned for a week.

That day their friend Stewart was stabbed on the top deck 
of a bus in West Norwood.

Okusanya, seen here fleeing the scene, told police 'Stabbings happened everywhere... it's how life is now. Everyone gets stabbed, everyone gets shot. Everyone dies, everyone goes to jail, that's how life is'

CCTV cameras recorded them travelling 
to see him at King’s College Hospital before heading to a shopping 
centre in Camberwell to buy a knife from a Bargain Express.

When the shopkeeper refused to sell 
them the weapon without seeing a passport or driving licence they asked a
stranger to help, claiming one of their mothers needed it for cooking.

The pair then got a taxi driver to take them to Brixton and drop them off at the edge of the Moorlands Estate at 5.30pm.

At that time Kwame, who lived in 
Catford, happened to be walking through the estate with one of his 
friends after leaving the recording studio.

Garfield Stewart whose knifing prompted 
the murder had been wearing a T-shirt which bore the slogan ‘RIP Little 
Zac’ - a reference to Zac Olumegbon murdered eight months earlier in 
July 2011.

Okusanya had worn a similar t-shirt in
a You Tube video posted online which was entitled “Death Keeps Calling”
and paid homage to Olumegbon.

Jurors heard Okusanya was close 
friends with Zac Olumegbon and starred in ‘Death Keeps Calling.’

When police searched his home they 
found photos of three other murder victims - Abukar Mahamood, who was 
shot dead aged 16 in 2007; Sadiq Adebeyi, 25, who was shot dead in May 
2011; and Nana Darko-Frimpong, 16, who was shot dead in June 2011.

Okusanya told police they were all his
friends and added: ‘Stabbings happen everywhere... it’s how life is 
now. Everyone gets stabbed, everyone gets shot. Everyone dies, everyone 
goes to jail, that’s how life is. In a typical black area, people get 
stabbed, people get shot, people die.’

Kwame Ofosu-Asare's uncle said today that the killers should serve the rest of their lives 
behind bars to set an example to other gang members intent on violence.

Alexander Asare-Ansah said no-body was safe until the message got 
across.

Speaking outside the Old Bailey he called for a tougher crack down on 
gangs and their members as his nephew and his friend were innocently in 
the area to use a recording studio and were attacked for no other 
reason.

He said: 'Something has to be done. As my brother said you don't need a 
visa to go to that area. They just went there for a purpose. It may 
happen to other people. Nobody is safe.

'All we say is life should be life for them. If not they will come out 
and do it again. Life should be life so it sets and example for all the 
other people.'

Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said: 'Kwame was an entirely innocent young man with a bright future in front of him.

'He was selected at random, just 
because he was walking through an estate deemed to be enemy territory by
these two violent gang members.'
