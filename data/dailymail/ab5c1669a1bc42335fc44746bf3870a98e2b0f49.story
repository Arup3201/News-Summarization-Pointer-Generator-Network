The woman whose eight-month-old baby boy may have lain next to the body for 'several days' was 'not depressed' according to people who knew her.

The woman had given birth to the boy while the baby's father was in jail, Daily Mail Australia has been told, but the mother who was in her thirties was 'very happy, very positive and loved being a mother'.

Police are contacting relatives of the little boy, who was in critical condition when officers entered the fibro Department of Housing dwelling in Wollongong, south of Sydney, on Tuesday and found the infant with the body of his dead mother.

The baby was rushed to Wollongong Hospital and later transferred to Randwick Children's Hospital in Sydney where his condition has improved.

'The baby is in a stable conditions and he's going to be OK,' a police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

The man who is believed to be the boy's father was seen with the woman in a nearby street ten days ago, but she had not been seen since then.
