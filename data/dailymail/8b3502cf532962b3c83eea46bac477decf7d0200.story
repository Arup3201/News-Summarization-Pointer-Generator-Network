In rehab: Schumacher was conscious as he was transported 120 miles from Grenoble Hospital to University Hospital Lausanne on Monday morning

Formula One legend Michael Schumacher had his eyes open and was conscious during his transfer from a French hospital to a facility in Switzerland, according to a Swiss report.

It also stated that Schumacher, 45, was able to communicate to ambulance staff by nodding his head.

Schumacher was transported 120 miles from Grenoble Hospital to University Hospital Lausanne on Monday morning.

The report in the Swiss tabloid Blick 
stated that the ambulance was operated by Sanitätoberwallis, a company 
based in Visp in the canton of Valais rather than from Grenoble or 
Lausanne.

Ambulance staff 
were not told the identity of the world-famous patient in advance. They 
also had to relinquish their mobile phones on arrival at Grenoble.

Matthias
 Volken, medical superintendent of the ambulance firm, said: 'I can 
confirm that we carried out the drive to transfer (Schumacher) on 
Monday.'

The paper said Schumacher had lost a lot of weight during his 170 days in hospital since the accident.

Schumacher did not speak, but he communicated by nodding his head and had his eyes open for most of the journey, the paper said.

The hospital where he is now being treated is one of Switzerland’s best and has renowned neurology experts.

It is in the city of Lausanne, just 20 miles from Schumacher's home, where he lives with his wife Corinna and two children.

The University Hospital of the Canton of Vaud (CHUV) in Lausanne, where Schumacher was transferred from a French hospital to begin a lengthy rehabilitation regime after his terrible skiing accident left him in a coma

It is almost 25 weeks ago that Schumacher, a very competent skier, suffered his life-threatening accident.

He was holidaying with family and friends in the French resort of Meribel, where he owns a chalet.

On Monday his manager Sabine Kehm announced that he was no longer in a coma and had been transferred to Lausanne where he will undergo a lengthy rehabilitation regime.
