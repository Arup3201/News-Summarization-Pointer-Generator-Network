Boxing champion Tyson Fury tried to fend off two police patrolmen who stopped his new car by exclaiming: 'I'm a superstar - I'm going to report you for jealousy.'

The 26-year-old heavyweight  who was with his three children in a green Mitsubishi Shogun was so annoyed by traffic on the M6 that he decided to shoot along the hard shoulder. 

Traffic officers driving in a BMW X5 noticed the sportsman sneaking along the emergency-only lane and pulled him over.

CCTV cameras followed Fury as he continued to drive along the hard shoulder avoiding traffic 

When asked for his name, Fury, who is the WBO heavyweight champion said: ''I'm a boxer, I'm a superstar, I'm a celebrity'. 

Officers informed Fury, who is named after the former heavyweight champion 'Iron' Mike Tyson, that he was going to be booked for the offence, he replied: 'Good... I'm going to report you to the the police for jealousy.' 

However, officers then discovered that the £40,000 vehicle was uninsured and ordered Fury to hand over the keys. The boxer initially refused to the request but eventually said he would arrange to recover the car from the police pound.

Details of the exchange emerged at Preston Magistrates' court where Fury, from Heysham was convicted of careless driving and having no insurance.

He was not in court claiming he was 'bedridden' with diarrhoea. He was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay £360 in costs. His licence which already has three points was endorsed with a further eight penalty points.

The incident occurred on 18 April 2014 after Fury was spotted at around 1:30pm on the hard shoulder of the M61 near Walton-le- Dale where there had been a build up of traffic on the northbound carriageway. He took a slip road before entering the M6 heading Northbound towards Bamber Bridge where again used the hard shoulder to pass slow moving traffic. 

Eventually the boxer is pulled over by the Highways Agency who ask him why he's using the hard shoulder

The Highway Agency staff warned Fury about driving on the hard shoulder, but he continued to use the emergency lane and was eventually stopped by police who had been alerted 

Miss Philippa Jones prosecuting said: 'Quite simply Mr Fury is seen to be travelling along the hard shoulder of the motorway. He is initially stopped by the Highway Agency they stopped him, spoke with him and allowed him on his way. Instead of proceeding onto the motorway he continues his travels on the hard shoulder. The traffic was extremely heavy. I'm going to suggest there is only one reason - to bypass all the traffic. It falls below the standard of driving.'

PC Julian Berry who was travelling with a colleague on mobile duty in a BMW X5 Road Policing car told the court they had received information from the regional control centre about Fury's car.

He said: 'We were informed by the motorway control room, they were watching the vehicle on CCTV travelling along the hard shoulder of the M61 in what they believed to be an attempt to bypass standard traffic on what was a busy afternoon. We were given the registration number.'

He added that they located Fury and were also given a second account as Fury again took onto the hard shoulder to bypass traffic. He told the court that they waited for Fury at Junction 32 of the M6 as Fury continued his journey north and passed under them.

The officers stopped Fury near Garstang. PC Berry added: 'He told us his name was Tyson Fury. He gave us an '88 date of birth and address in Morecambe. There was no insurance held for the vehicle he was driving. When asked about this he told us his vehicle had just been bought from Manchester and believed he was driving as a named driver on a traders policy.'

The boxer, pictured, was fined £1,000 and handed eight points on his driving licences after he was convicted of careless driving and driving without insurance at Preston Magistrates Court

But PC Berry said that despite producing a policy there was a discrepancy and that he was not in fact a named driver on that vehicle. 'When I told him he was been reported he replied with 'good'. He also said 'I'm a boxer, I'm a superstar, I'm a celebrity'.

'He asked for mine and my colleague's numbers and said he was going to report us to the police for jealousy.'

He added that there were no other adults in the car but that there had been Fury's three children who he believe were eight, nine and 10.

PC Berry added: 'The vehicle was seized and Mr Fury was obstructive. Initially he refused to hand over the keys and said he would organise his own recovery.' The court was played moving footage from the Regional Control Centre for the North West Motorway Police which is operated manually.

Fury denied wrongdoing and tried to get the trial delayed due to his illness. His lawyer James Ball told the hearing: 'He is bedridden, a manager or agent of Mr Fury (contacted) saying that his client is effectively bedridden, suffering with diarrhoea and vomiting. A medical note dated yesterday says he is not fit for work and he must stay away from work until 48 hours after the last loose motions.'

But the request was refused after it emerged the boxer made another attempt to get the case adjourned earlier in the week - claiming he was in training for next fight.

District Judge Roger Lowe said: 'There's a difference between being unfit for work and being unfit for court. I don't feel the symptoms would have prevented him from being fit for court. The court would have been quite accommodating, any difficulties part way through the court could break halfway through for him to use the facilities.'

He added: 'Footage shows the vehicle being driven along the hard shoulder of the motorway. clearly it is only for emergencies - it seems pretty obvious he is doing so to avoid slowing, standing traffic. There is no evidence he is driving in an emergency situation.

'There are no other adults in the car just the defendant and three children. I'm satisfied he is driving. I find the offence proved.

'PC Berry examined the documents, they didn't appear to cover Mr Fury. In the absence of any evidence provided, I find that the allegation against the defendant is proved.'

Fury is currently preparing to defend his European Heavyweight Championship title at the O2 Arena on February 28, and is set to fight for the English Title on April 4.
