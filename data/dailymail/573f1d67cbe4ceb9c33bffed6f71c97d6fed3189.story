Locked up: Police were dispatched twice this past Monday to free men held against their will at the home of Terry Boyd

A woman was arrested twice in one day after holding men against their will for sex.

According to a police report, 52-year-old Terry Boyd was arrested around 4am Monday when two witnesses called police saying they heard an loud argument and a man screaming for help at her Wausau, Wisconsin home.

When police arrived they found two men trapped in a room on the second floor. The front door was locked and Boyd was sitting against the door to stop the officers from entering.

One of the men dropped a set of keys to the officers.

Boyd was apparently combative with officers during the process.

One of the men said he was a roommate of Boyd's and that she locked them in the room, saying she wouldn't let them leave until one of them had sex with her.

The men left the residence saying they didn't want to press charges against Boyd.

After police left Boyd called the hospital, a counseling agency and emergency dispatchers saying the police had 'beaten her up.'

An ambulance arrived and took her to the Aspirus Wausau Hospital where she, again, became combative with medical personal and was arrested for disorderly conduct.

Boyd was released the same day, but arrested yet again when police got another complaint that she was holding her male roommate against his will.

Police arrived around 7pm and arrested Boyd for false imprisonment.

Boyd was taken to Marathon County Jail and a judge set bond for $1,500. She will have a hearing September 5.
