The invite read 'Expect Severe Delays' and the Anya Hindmarch show stayed true to its word running fashionably late.

However fans were prepared to wait as the accessories designer's show is easily one of the hottest tickets at London Fashion Week.

With her previous catwalks transformed into fairgrounds complete with spinning teacups and supermarkets with working conveyor belts, guests can always expect a good show.

And on the final day of London Fashion Week, Anya - who is one of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite bag designers - performed her usual magic of turning mundane everyday items into desirable accessories that often attract a long waiting list.

For her autumn/winter 2015 line entitled The Diversion Collection Anya was influenced by Britain's motorways, with models marching down a catwalk decorated with road markings and overseen by LED speed limits.

The London Gay Men’s Chorus dressed in road worker uniforms brought the brightly coloured, high-visibility-themed  show to a tuneful crescendo.

As usual the show attracted quirkier characters to the front row including artist Grayson Perry, dressed in his finest drag, as well as Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason.

The no U-turn sign appeared several times across her line of leather accessories 

The famous Ebury bag that has proven popular in previous seasons received a high-vis makeover 

Continuing the motorway theme, the Ebury even saw the service station Little Chef logo make an appearance 

Motifs for this season stepped away from the busy sticker theme of her last collection, with bags stamped with traffic signs such as 'road works ahead' and 'no U-turn.'

The motorway theme was continued with the covetable Ebury design which has been a sell-out after last year's autumn/winter 2014 collection, in which the designer covered the bags in retro Frosties packet designs.

This season however, the leather tote was emblazoned with iconic images of the Little Chef service station.

Even the designer's iconic chandelier tassels took on a practical makeover transformed into traffic cones in bright orange and white.

This season sees Anya introduce clothing to the brand, but her signature bags were the star of the show, branded with signs including (left to right) a fire exit sign, a 'stop' sign and the 'no U-turn' insignia

Clothing items include bomber jackets and shearling coats complete with road sign logos, while bags were decorated with traffic cone purses and 'no mobile phone' clutches

Certain items from the new line including the Chevron Ebury and Eddie Stobart clutch (pictured) are available to pre-order online for a limited time only 

Perhaps one of the most unique items in the collection is the Eddie Stobart clutch that is a miniature replica of the motorway regulars.

Speaking to Marie Claire about her new collection Anya says she dreamed up the bright orange designs during her commute. 

‘Basically I spend way too much time on the M25! I had this idea to look at the beauty in the everyday, capturing that slightly trance-like feeling you get when you’re in you car on the motorway and you’ve got a clear road in front of you with your favourite bit of music on. 

'And this collection is about how you feel in that moment, as well as all of the beautiful imagery of that signage going on around you.' 

Aside from the roadside chic Anya paid homage to her favourite foodie fashions with other miniature bags including recreations of Polo mints, Yorkie and KitKat packets.

A grey clutch was printed with a 'park and ride' sign - a familiar sight in most British towns, if not the catwalk; a military green bag was turned into a portable 'go' sign with a striped handle

Anya also included some of her food based accessories which have previously been a big hit

An Emergency Exit fur jacket also made an appearance on the runway paired with a Free Recovery sweater

The Stop Ephson  bag is the collection's most expensive piece at £2,695

As well as her usual miniatures Anya made space for roomier bags in the line featuring several leather backpacks dotted with brightly coloured logos. 

Contrary to previous seasons the AW15 catwalk saw the debut of the brand's first range of clothing having previously only selling handbags and silk scarves.

Items in the collection include Emergency Exit bomber jackets and high visibility tabards recreated as fur gilets. 

Certain items from the logo-heavy collection are currently available to pre-order online for a limited time following their appearance on the catwalk. 

Anya says that the inspiration for the collection came from sitting in traffic on the M25

The British designer wanted to capture the trance you fall into while driving with your favourite song on

Anya also incorporated her signature tassels and snake skin design into her road work creations 

However, those eager for an Ebury should start saving now as prices begin at £125 for a sticker and rocket to £2,695 for an Ephson leather bag.

The British designer's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in Florence, Italy.

Noting that drawstring leather duffle bags were popular, she borrowed £600 to import some to England and quickly sold 500, with a little help from Harpers & Queen magazine.

A year later she had opened her first shop in Hackney. Fast forward 25 years and she now runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Madonna and the late Margaret Thatcher as fans.

And with people flocking to her site already to secure a must-have accessory it looks like Anya could remain queen of the it-bag for another season. 

Anya's presentations tend to attract quirkier characters such as the artist Grayson Perry (left) and Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason (right) who both made an appearance today
