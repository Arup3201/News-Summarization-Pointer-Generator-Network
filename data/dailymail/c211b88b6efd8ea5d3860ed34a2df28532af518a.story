Defeat: Carina Trimingham described stories referring to her sexuality published after her secret affair with the former Energy Secretary became public as 'highly unpleasant and hurtful'

Chris Huhne’s lover had only herself to blame for a series of newspaper  articles she claimed provoked a ‘cataclysmic interference’ with her private life, a High Court judge ruled yesterday.

Carina Trimingham described stories referring to her sexuality published after her secret affair with the former Energy Secretary became public as ‘highly unpleasant and hurtful’.

But Mr Justice Tugendhat threw out her claim for damages against the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, leaving her with estimated legal costs of £410,000, and in a damning judgment accused her of seriously exaggerating some of her evidence.

Describing her as not a ‘good or reliable witness’, he added: ‘One reason for my reluctance to accept Ms Trimingham’s evidence is the poor view I have formed of her candour, given all the circumstances of this case.’

Miss Trimingham, 44, went to court over what she said were ‘crude and demeaning stereotypes’ about her bisexuality and sued Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Mail newspapers, for alleged misuse of private information and harassment in 65 articles.

But the judge said she was ‘not the purely private figure she claims to be’ because of her involvement with Mr Huhne ‘both professionally, as his press agent, and personally, as his secret mistress, in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of Eastleigh (his Hampshire constituency) about how much he valued his family’.

Ordering her to pay Associated’s legal costs and refusing her leave to appeal, he added: ‘Ms Trimingham has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome.

‘The difficult situation she found herself in was of her own making.’Rejecting all her claims, he said: ‘I do not accept the first premise of Ms Trimingham’s case, namely that she is a private individual.

‘There are two reasons. First, in her professional capacity , she undertook to work for one of the leading politicians in the country in the capacity of press officer.

‘Secondly, in her private capacity, she conducted a sexual relationship with Mr Huhne which he told her would lead to him leaving his wife.

‘She did this in conditions of secrecy which she knew were likely to give rise to publicity, or in other words, to a political scandal.

‘The scandal may or may not be bigger than she (or Mr Huhne) had foreseen, but there was always likely to be a scandal.

‘The public has an interest in knowing how the personal life of a leading politician, especially a Cabinet Minister, is likely to affect, or has affected, the business of government. So Ms Trimingham in her private capacity chose to take the risk of being mixed up in a political scandal, which her own conduct precipitated.’

The judge also warned: ‘Where the Press report the break-up through adultery of the marriage of a Cabinet Minister, a court should be slow to decide that information about the other woman which is included in the articles is irrelevant.’

Mr Huhne left his wife of 26 years, Vicky Pryce, for Miss Trimingham soon after she became his press officer during the 2010 General Election.

It followed a two-year affair, which he kept secret from Miss Pryce and Miss Trimingham kept secret from her civil partner, Julie Bennett.

The judge heard that because her husband’s press aide was in a  same-sex relationship, Miss Trimingham was the last woman Miss Pryce might have suspected he would run off with.

During a five-day hearing last month Miss Trimingham, a former political journalist, admitted giving newspapers tips about the sex lives of Hollywood stars and senior politicians, selling a diary item to the Mail on Sunday about the current Deputy Prime Minister, which she described as ‘Nick Clegg 18 shags story’.

Mr Justice Tugendhat, in a withering 136-page judgment, totally rejected her case.

He said he was not persuaded Miss Trimingham ‘was being candid’ when she initially said she had sold stories only to the Guardian and claimed to have forgotten the other newspapers and what the stories were about.

Dismissed: MP Chris Huhne's partner Carina Trimingham has lost her privacy and harassment claim against Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail

A High Court judge told Ms Trimingham, pictured left today and right at the Lib Dem Annual Conference last September, that she was in a situation 'of her own making'

He said her words, the ‘Nick Clegg 18 shags story’, on her invoice supported the view that she was ‘a journalist with a robust personality . . . a person who saw nothing wrong in disclosing to the world at large what she considered to be newsworthy information about the sexual activities of others.

‘That was so even if (or especially if) that information had previously been known only to a small number of people.

‘Likewise, she saw nothing wrong in disclosing to the newspapers information conveyed to her in or from a private conversation.’

The judge singled out evidence given by Mail columnist Andrew Pierce, whom Miss Trimingham accused of inaccurate reporting. He said: ‘I found Mr Pierce to be a candid and reliable witness.

‘Given the assessment that I have made of the evidence of Ms Trimingham, I have no hesitation in preferring the evidence of Mr Pierce  where it conflicts with that of Ms Trimingham.’

Columnist Amanda Platell and other Mail journalists gave evidence during the hearing and the judge said: ‘I have no reason to doubt that all of the defendant’s witnesses were giving their evidence truthfully.

‘It follows from this and from the view that I formed of Ms Trimingham’s evidence . . . that where her evidence conflicts with theirs, as it does in the case of Mr Pierce in particular, I reject Ms Trimingham’s evidence.’ He was also critical of Miss Trimingham’s unfounded allegations that a journalist had stolen a photograph of her civil partnership ceremony.

‘This is a regrettable part of her evidence,’ said the judge.

Mr Justice Tugendhat said what the Mail wrote was insulting and offensive in so far as it referred to her personal clothing and appearance.

But the words ‘bisexual’ and ‘lesbian’ are factual words which are not normally to be understood as pejorative by a reasonable person.

‘What the defendant has expressed hostility to is not her sexuality but her conduct.

‘It would be a serious interference with freedom of expression if those wishing to express their own views could be silenced by, or threatened with, claims for harassment based on subjective claims by individuals that they feel offended or insulted.’

Rejecting her claims that the 65 articles amounted to harassment, the judge pointed out: ‘Each time the defendant has named Ms Trimingham it has done so in a story in which the main character is Mr Huhne.

‘And each publication has been prompted by a particular event in Mr Huhne’s public career or life, or some other newsworthy event, such as a party conference.

‘The main target of the articles complained of is Mr Huhne.

‘Ms Trimingham is named in them only because of the very important secondary role she played in events relating to Mr Huhne.’ 

On her claim for misuse of private information regarding Miss Trimingham’s sexuality, he said: ‘It is her own evidence, as well as the evidence of  the journalists, that even before the  revelation of her affair with Mr Huhne in June 2010 she had had relationships with other men, and those who knew her knew of her sexuality. She did not attempt to keep it private.

‘The submission that in these circumstances Ms Trimingham had a reasonable expectation of privacy as to her being bisexual seems to me to be unarguable.’

The judge added: ‘It is important that I stress that I have not reached any conclusion about the conduct of Mr Huhne in relation to any of the matters referred to in this judgment.

‘He is not a party to this action, and he has not given evidence.

‘It would be wrong for the court, or for any reader of this judgment, to draw any inference adverse to Mr Huhne in a case where he has not given evidence and not been represented.’

A spokesman for Associated Newspapers said: ‘This was an important example of the Press exercising its right to free speech in relation to matters of significant public interest.

‘We are pleased that the court agreed with us and has today dismissed all of Miss Trimingham’s complaints.

‘The references to Miss Trimingham’s sexuality in our coverage were never  pejorative, private or in any way homophobic.

‘Miss Trimingham chose to level some very serious charges against our  journalists in this case. This judgment vindicates both our journalists and  their journalism.’

Outside court Miss Trimingham  said she thought the ruling was ‘confused and wrong,’ adding: ‘I am extremely  disappointed by this judgment. I intend to appeal.’
