Gone: Avon and Somerset Police Chief Constable Colin Port who has quit after newly elected PCC Sue Mountstevens said he would have to reapply for his own job

A mother-of-three elected as a new Police and Crime Commissioner has seen off the current chief constable on her first day in the job.

Sue Mountstevens, 57, who was elected last week as an independent candidate, told long serving Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Colin Port he must reapply for his own job.

He refused, and quit on the spot. He is the first of what is expected to be a number of casualties of the new regime in which elected officials take control of the police for the first time.

Mrs Mountstevens, a former magistrate and married mother of three children, stood on a platform of cutting anti-social behaviour, burglary and violence.

She also promised to keep party politics out of policing and act ‘without interference of national politics’.

The day before she took office, she met Mr Port - who has led the force for eight years - and told him his post would be opened to competition from outsiders and he would have to reapply.

She had the option of extending his contract for another year, but advertising the job would allow her to appoint a chief for her whole three and a half year term, she told him.

Mr Port, who will retire on a pension estimated at £100,000 a year, said: ‘Yesterday I had a meeting with the police and crime commissioner.

‘She told me she intends to start the process to recruit a chief constable to take Avon and Somerset forward. I told her I had no intention of applying for my job.’

‘I can confirm that I will be retiring from the police service on January 26 2013 at the end of my fixed-term appointment. In effect, I will be leaving considerably sooner.’

Mrs Mountstevens, was a long-serving 
member of the Police Authority and director of a local family business, 
Mountstevens Bakeries.

Sue Mountstevens, who lives near Pill, North
Somerset, spent 15 years as a magistrate serving on adult, youth and family
cases.

The mother of three was a director of family business Mountstevens Bakeries,
which employed around 1,300 people and had more than 90 outlets across the South
West.

Mrs Mountstevens, 57, who has also served on crime, police and
prison boards, was elected to her new position with 65 per cent of the vote in the second round
of counting last week.

She was elected ahead of the Tory candidate last Friday with 125,704 votes to 67,842.

She paid tribute to Mr Port saying he had ‘made great improvements for this area’ and said he would be ‘greatly missed’.

She
said: ‘Everyone is aware that the chief constable’s contract expires on
January 26. Because of that, I would like to run a competitive process 
to appoint a chief constable for my whole term of office.

‘It was his choice not to apply but I know that he will continue to do great things and I wish him the very best for the future. He has increased detection rates and reduced crime. He will be greatly missed by staff and partners.’

Long-serving: Colin Port had been Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police for the past eight years

Police and Crime Commissioners were 
elected following votes last Thursday in 41 police areas across England 
and Wales.

Police and crime commissioners have the job of ‘bringing communities closer to the police, building confidence in the system and restoring trust’, according to the Home Office website.

They are tasked with creating a police and crime plan, setting the force budget and appointing or dismissing the chief constable.

The former police authorities also had the power to hire and fire but this rarely happened.

Four police forces in the South West now have acting chief
constables, but they are not all said to be looking at going for the top job.

The polls were marred by poor turnout, with just one in six 
registered voters participating.

PCCs
will have powers to hire and fire force Chief Constables, and will set 
the priorities for policing in their area.

Senior officers fiercely 
resisted the creation of PCC posts, claiming they would politicise the 
police.

Sir Hugh Orde, 
president of the Association of Chief Police Officers said: ‘Colin Port 
is a hugely experienced chief constable who has led Avon and Somerset 
police with distinction over the last eight years, reducing crime and 
raising public confidence, steering the force through a period of major 
change and handling a number of high profile criminal cases.

‘His skills and experience will be a big loss to the service.’
