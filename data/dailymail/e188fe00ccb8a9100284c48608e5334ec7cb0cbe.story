Former QPR defender Anton Ferdinand is in talks over a move to Reading.

Ferdinand is available on a free transfer from Thailand side Police United and is set to sign a two-year deal at the Madejski Stadium.

The 29-year-old centre back looks set to make a return to English football after spells away at Bursaspor and Antalyaspor in Turkey as well as his time in Thailand.

Back in Britain: Ferdinand will come back to English football for the first time since leaving QPR

QPR, meanwhile, are understood to have offered £2million for highly-rated Guingamp midfielder Younousse Sankhare.

The French club are keen to keep Sankhare and he still has a contract running until 2016, but L’Equipe suggests that QPR are among a host of teams chasing his signature.

Experience: Ferdinand battles for the ball with Chelsea's Didier Drogba during his time at West Ham
