Oldham chairman Simon Corney believes Paul Scholes will manage the Sky Bet League One club 'one day', but admits it will be 'difficult' to tempt him to take the vacancy at the moment.

The former England and Manchester United midfielder, 40, was immediately linked with his boyhood outfit when the Football League's third youngest manager Lee Johnson exited SportsDirect.com Park last week to join League One rivals Barnsley.

The romantic notion that Scholes would take his first managerial position with Latics appears fanciful but Corney does think he could take the helm one day.

Boyhood Oldham supporter Paul Scholes will manage the Latics in the future according to Simon Corney 

However, Oldham chairman Corney was doubful Scholes could commit considering his current media duties 

Speaking on a BBC Radio Manchester phone-in alongside director Anthony Gee, who suggested that the Oldham job 'may interest' Scholes 'at some point', Corney said: 'We speak on a regular basis and Paul occasionally comes down and does training sessions.

'He's a friend of the club. We know what Paul's all about, he's very low key, he doesn't make a big deal about things. He turns up at the games - never turns up at the directors' box - he turns up with his two lads, flat cap down and you wouldn't even know he was there.

'I'd love to have him on board, (but) it's difficult. Again, you have to ask would Oldham be the right club for somebody like Paul? It's not just about us wanting Paul, it's also would it be the right thing for him?

'I think Anthony's right that one day he will come and manage the club but it's all about timing with him.'

Gee also confirmed Scholes, who now has media commitments with the likes of BT Sport, had not applied for the position but that they did intend to hold talks with him in the near future.

The two Oldham board members also touched on the club's controversial move to attempt to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans in January, a signing they eventually pulled out of in the face of overwhelming pressure from sponsors promising to withdraw their support, while staff members were also subjected to abusive threats.

Since his retirement from football the former Manchester United star has taken up a role with BT Sport 

Latics had originally indicated they had no desire to acquire Evans back in December, but Gee revealed they returned to the possibility in the new year when Johnson told the board of directors he had had a change of heart.

'We did a hell of a lot of due diligence,' added Gee.

'We met with the player on two or three occasions and if you remember when we were first linked with him, the manager actually said to us that he'd rather pass. We pulled our interest immediately.

'It was when the manager came to us the second time and said, 'Actually, maybe I'll go and have a chat with him', that we rekindled our interest which led to all the scenes that you remember in January.

'If I was put on the spot and asked would I do the same thing again? I think the truth of the matter is I probably would.

'I'm also a firm believer in the rule of law. If we don't have the rule of law and we don't have rehabilitation in society then I don't know what sort of society we have.

'Whilst his crime was very serious there are other people out there playing football who have killed people. We've had a similar case at Oldham with Lee Hughes.

'If I'm asked whether I regret it? No. Do I understand how difficult it was for the fans and the community? Yes. It was hard for us as directors as well.

'We always had the best interests of the club at heart, even if it's hard to believe.'
