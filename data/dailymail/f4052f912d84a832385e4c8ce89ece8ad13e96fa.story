As ever it was Diego Maradona who expressed the mood of the Argentinian public best after the semi-final win against Holland, even if it involved an inevitable degree of self-aggrandisement.

‘They laughed when my first words as Argentina coach were: “Give me Mascherano and 10 others”,’ said Maradona. ‘But no one is laughing any more.’

And even if almost everything else Maradona pronounced on as national team coach of Argentina four years ago was wrong, that much was right. Even in the country of Lionel Messi, the man who once upon a time could not even make West Ham’s first team is rightly being acknowledged as one of the world’s finest holding midfielders.

Challenge of the World Cup: Javier Mascherano denies Arjen Robben

Top block: Mascherao has been an influential cog as Argentina chase a third World Cup win

The sliding tackle to block Arjen Robben’s shot, which saved Argentina against Holland, will never be forgotten, not simply because of the skill and tenacity with which it was executed but also because of the excruciating post-match quote from Mascherano. ‘Sorry for being gross but I tore my anus doing that,’ he said.

Given that he has spent much of the past two years filling in at centre-half at Barcelona, and at times being exposed, many might have forgotten just how good Mascherano was at Liverpool when directing a game from the base of midfield.

At this tournament there has been a reminder and Wednesday’s performance has brought an  outpouring of praise in his homeland, where he has been portrayed as a cross between Rambo, a  latter-day Che Guevara — the ‘Che’ in his name making it an easy pun — and the 19th century liberator of South America, Jose de San Martin.

For Mascherano, very much a footballer’s footballer rather than a galactico, it has all become a bit much. ‘I’m not Rambo nor am I San Martin,’ he said. ‘I don’t take anything that is being said seriously. I can see the humourous side of it all but I’m embarrassed. And that’s not false modesty because false modesty is worse than pride.

‘The
 hero worship is too much as people begin to have expectations that 
perhaps you can’t meet. That’s what’s been going on the past few days. 
People think that you can do things that in  reality you can’t. I’m 
grateful for the praise of the people but honestly I don’t really like 
it. It makes me uneasy.’

That said, where once it was assumed Messi would lead this team — and in a manner of speaking he does and is still the most influential figure on the pitch — it is both Mascherano and Messi who were delivering the team talks before extra-time and penalties in the huddle of Argentina players.

It appears there is a symbiotic relationship between the two, one a natural leader by virtue of his intelligence and personal qualities, the other a leader because of his sheer ability.

‘We’re satisfied and calm about the job we’ve done,’ said Mascherano. ‘Now we have to make a pact as a team to reach the next level.

‘I still can’t believe we’re playing the final game at Maracana. I’m really happy to part of this group. It was a very intelligent tactical display against Holland but it doesn’t end there. We are about to play the most important game of our lives.’

As for Maradona’s assessment of the team of Mascherano and 10 others, he is predictably dismissive. ‘It’s neither Mascherano, nor Messi,’ he said. ‘It’s all of us together. We’re proud of being a really good group, without egos and all aiming for the same thing.’
