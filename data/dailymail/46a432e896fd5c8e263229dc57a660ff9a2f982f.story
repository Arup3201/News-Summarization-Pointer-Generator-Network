She's head over heels in love with husband Marvin Humes and knows a thing or two about fashion, so it made sense for The Saturdays star Rochelle to design a date night-inspired collection ahead of Valentine’s Day.

The popstar and mother-of-one has designed a capsule collection for Very.co.uk and is the perfect poster girl for her designs in a short floral dress, purple bodycon and pink duster coat.

Her 12-piece collection - her third for the e-tailer - aims to offer a piece for every occasion, from seductive figure-hugging dress to cute capri pants.

Rochelle Humes, who is one fifth of girlgroup The Saturdays, has designed a Valentine's Day capsule collection for Very.co.uk and says her flirty designs are perfect for date night

Speaking about dressing up for the romantic day, Rochelle said: 'Dressing for dates can be difficult. Go for something fun and flirty like a little dress. 

'Marvin loves it when I get dressed up. This Valentine’s Day we’ll be away but we’ll probably do something romantic - I am leaving it to him to plan!' 

A spokesperson for the brand said: 'Rochelle’s collection for Very continues to go from strength to strength. It is proving incredibly popular with our customers as it offers great style for every shape and size. 

'Rochelle knows what women want from their wardrobe, and her exclusive capsule range gives our customers just that.'

As well as more revealing dresses, she wanted to include something for everyone so added more casual jumpers and floral print trousers to the range

Rochelle’s collection launches online today with prices ranging from £29-£79 and sizes from 8- 20.

The star is certainly a walking advert for the collection; she appeared on the Lorraine show today wearing a striped lantern mini skirt from her own Very collection.

The 25-year-old teamed the number with a black V-neck top from high-street store, Zara, giving the look some edge with a leather biker jacket.

Rochelle had been invited onto the daytime show to talk to host Lorraine Kelly about her involvement with Red Nose Day.

The singer has been actively involved in the launch, allowing her husband Marvin to makeover her face in a promotional shot.
