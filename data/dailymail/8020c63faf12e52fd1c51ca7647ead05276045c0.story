It may have been battered by the worst of the Bank Holiday weather, but even in the wind and rain Bamburgh Castle still has a lot going for it, because today it was named Britain's best-loved picnic spot.

The Medieval fortress in Northumbria, which enjoys a dramatic view of the North Sea above a wide sandy beach, is officially the best place in the UK to eat a sandwich and watch the world go by.

Once a common battleground for bloody combat between the Scottish and English, the now tranquil Bamburgh cannot be matched as a venue for a traditional picnic, experts have decided.

A new poll has found that the key ingredient for the ultimate al fresco lunch is a view of water, with seven of the top ten overlooking a river, the sea or a reservoir.

Can't be matched: Bamburgh Castle on the Northumberland coast has today been revealed as the best place in Britain to sit and have a picnic

Number two: Belfast City Hall in the heart of the capital of Northern Ireland was considered an outstanding spot for lunch and the top urban venue

Norfolk idyll: The harbour and beach at Blakeney in North Norfolk boasts the beast of coastal scenery as well as a wonderful village centre

Following the stunning Bamburgh Castle in the rankings are Belfast City Hall in Northern Ireland, Blakeney in Norfolk, Box Hill in Surrey, Coast Road in Cumbria and the Calf and Cow rocks in West Yorkshire.

The remaining places in the top ten go to the Elan Valley Reservoir in Mid-Wales, Lower Slaughter in Gloucestershire, Rhosneigr Beach in north-west Wales and finally Stoke Bay Beach in Hampshire.

Experts said today that these places all offer one wonderful thing - people who 
decide to dine in the fresh air at any of these places will be genuinely
happier when they leave.

After several months of nominations, shortlisting and then a vote, VisitEngland, Visit Wales and bakers Kingsmill have announced the best of British lunch spots.

10,000 people put forward their own suggestions and this was whittled down to 25 before the top ten was announced today.

They were not just judged on their beauty, they also had to have easy accessibility for all and are also free to visit.

English countryside: A group of people enjoying the view and a bite to eat on Box Hill in Surrey, which overlooks Dorking from the summit of the North Downs

Beautiful: After a walk the Cow and Calf rocks on Ilkley Moor near Bradford, West Yorkshire, was also considered one of the top places for an al fresco lunch

Best of British: This is the stunning, sweeping Coast Road, near Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, which ranks highly in the top ten

Pure drama: The Caban Coch Dam, Elan Valley, close to the area's reservoir in Powys received many votes as a great place to eat

Cotswolds: Tourists stop at the famous stone bridge over the River Eye, Lower Slaughter in Gloucestershire, one of England's most beautiful bridges

Each of the top ten will receive a plaque and a bench for people to sit and eat their lunch on.

James Berresford, the chief executive of VisitEngland, said he was pleased that the majority of the spots were in the country he represents.

'What better way to appreciate this green and pleasant land than to sit in a beautiful spot, unpack a delicious picnic and share lunch with friends and family?' he said.

Summer dream: Dog walkers and a family enjoy the beautiful sands at Rhosneigr Beach in North Wales, one of two places in Wales to make top the top ten

Final entry: Propping up the top picnic spots is Stokes Bay in Hampshire, which is renowned for its long sands and dramatic coastline

Dr Manon Williams, the chief executive for Visit Wales, said: "I'm delighted that two locations in Wales have made it to the top 10 lunch spots in the UK.

'The contrast in the two locations voted for by the public shows the variety of what Wales has to offer. Rhosneigr is on the glorious Wales coast and part of the 870–mile Wales Coast Path, and the beautiful, tranquil Elan Valley is a great place to spot a red kite while eating lunch.'
