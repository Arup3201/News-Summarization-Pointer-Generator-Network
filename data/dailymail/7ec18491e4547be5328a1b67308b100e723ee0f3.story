David Cameron blundered on Twitter today when he confused a Cabinet minister with a spoof Twitter account.

The Prime Minister, who once warned 'too many tweets might make a tw*t', wrote this morning: 'We're rolling out a cap on Benefits today - @IDS_MP and I are determined to make work pay.'

But @IDS_MP is not Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith but a parody Twitter account mocking the minister.

Gaffe: David Cameron's official account linked to the spoof @IDS_MP account which mocks the government

Reaction: The spoof account was quick to respond to the Prime Minister's mistake

Blunder: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan does not tweet, possibly heeding Mr Cameron's warnings about the perils of social media

In fact Mr Duncan Smith is not on Twitter at all, preferring to spread his political message on TV and radio, where he today accused the BBC of being 'politically-motivated' in its criticism of his reforms.

The clues that the @IDS_MP account was not real were there. The account biography includes 'parodia' and the phrase 'chin chin old bean'.

The most recent tweet reads: 'I've always supported a Mansion Tax. Your Tax buys my Mansion. Chin chin!'

This morning the account reacted to the Prime Minister's gaffe: 'Chin chin Dave. Round mine for a Pimms later?'

The Prime Minister was trying to highlight the new benefits cap which means that the maximum amount of benefits
a family can claim will be limited to £26,000 a year – a figure equal to
a pre-tax salary of more than £34,000.

Parody: There were plenty of clues to the fact that the @IDS_MP account was not genuine

Jokes: The spoof account includes a stream of gags about the wealth of Tory Cabinet ministers and their attitude to the poor

Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith 
today accused the BBC of launching a ‘politically-motivated’ attack on 
government plans to cap benefits.

In
an extraordinary on-air blast, the Work and Pensions Secretary accused 
the Corporation of using ‘lots of little cases’ to claim that limiting 
welfare payments would not get people back to work.

Mr Duncan Smith was grilled by BBC 
presenter John Humphrys, after the Today programme aired an interview 
with one benefits claimant who said she did not want to leave her home 
in London to find work.

The minister tore into the BBC’s attempts to undermine his 
reforms: 'What you are doing as always happens in 
the BBC is seeking out lots of little cases from people who are 
politically motivated to say this is wrong.’

Under the benefits cap, couples and 
lone parents will not receive more than £500 a week under the new cap, 
with single people limited to £350 a week.

The
coalition argues it is fair on people who do work and pay taxes that 
those on state-funded benefits do not receive more than the average 
working family.

Mr Duncan Smith used an appearance on

Mr Cameron ruled out joining Twitter in 2009 after several high profile figures saw tweets backfire.

The Tory leader told Christian O’Connell’s Absolute Radio breakfast show: ‘The trouble with Twitter, the instantness of it – too many twits might make a t***.’

Since then the site has grown in popularity and he performed the u-turn in September last year.

He has built up more than 360,000 followers, with a combination of policy announcements, insights into life in Number 10 and commenting on news events.

Th account is run by Mr Cameron and Tory aides and is separate to the official Downing Street feed for the Prime Minister.

It is not thought that Mr Cameron wrote the message linking to the parody account, but his official spokesman said today: 'You can be clear that the Prime Minister's tweets are entirely his views.'

The spokesman tried to make light of the mix-up, adding: 'I think it's hashtag one to take on the chin.'

In an attempt to divert attention from the gaffe, the account later added: 'I'm about to meet Burmese President Thein Sein - we'll be discussing political and economic reform in Burma.'
