Popular presenter Clare Balding was left by her own admission a gibbering wreck as the Princess Royal presented her with an OBE for a dazzling career in broadcasting.

An attack of nerves saw the normally calm and accomplished TV personality fluff her curtsey to Anne and almost trip up during the investiture ceremony staged at Windsor Castle.

Balding, 42, who was joined by her partner Alice Arnold at the Queen's Berkshire home, said after the ceremony: 'I got terribly nervous about this, I've been pretty busy then suddenly yesterday I thought 'gosh I'd better make sure everything's in order for tomorrow'.

'I
 was speaking absolute gibberish!' Clare Balding says she fell to bits 
as Princess Anne awarded her an OBE at Windsor Castle today

Blunder: Clare admitted afterwards she 'mucked her curtsey up' and nearly fell over as she turned to walk away

'I'm still a bit shaky now, I talked absolute gibberish, absolute gibberish - I was just hopeless. Mucked my curtsey up, nearly fell over as I turned and walked away, messed up properly, but luckily not too many people had seen that.'

The versatile broadcaster, who was an amateur jockey, has presented horse racing on radio and television for more than 18 years, and also hosted Countryfile, Crufts and BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Balding's first book, My Animals and Other Family, published last year and based on her childhood growing up in an unusual household, won biography of the year at the National Book Awards.

The broadcaster's family have a close association with the monarchy as her grandfather, father and brother Andrew have all trained racehorses for the Queen.

Recognition: Balding was honoured for the part she played in the well-received Olympics and Paralympics coverage last summer

Meeting the princess, someone she 
knows well, also brought back memories of a horse racing incident in 
1989 that featured in Balding's autobiography.

The
 broadcaster said: 'I've known the Princess Royal a long time, we rode 
against each other as amateur jockeys - we had an incident at Beverley 
racecourse many years ago so this feels like the story coming full 
circle in a nice way.

'I bumped her very badly in a race - it was all my fault. I think it's quite a funny incident and I wrote about it in my book.'

Balding
 was recognised for her sterling work outside racing circles last 
summer, playing a major part in the BBC's coverage of the London 
Olympics and later the Paralympics on Channel 4.

The broadcaster also led Channel 4's coverage of Royal Ascot - a permanent fixture in the Queen's calendar.

History: Clare - who knows the Princess Royal after the two rode together as amateur jockeys - said being awarded the OBE by Anne was like the story 'coming full circle'

The 42-year-old is from a family steeped in racing history, with her father Ian Balding best known for his handling of the legendary 1971 Derby hero Mill Reef.

Her brother, Andrew, is also a successful Classic-winning trainer, while her uncle, Toby Balding, is one of the few men to have trained the winner of the Grand National, the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Champion Hurdle.

Balding said: 'This is an incredible personal moment and it's lovely to have this recognition but I feel the job that I do, I get so much satisfaction from it and I enjoy it so much and I want to keep challenging myself and try to make myself a better broadcaster.'

Happy couple: Ms Balding, pictured with her partner Alice Arnold before she received her OBE, spoke about being 'outed' in 2003 and her family's reaction to her relationship
