A Conservative councillor was photographed as he spent two hours on his mobile phone during a town hall debate on a rise in council tax.

Councillor Eric Nicholson played solitaire, checked his bank account and caught up with emails while hiding his Blackberry under the table during the meeting at Kendal County Hall, Cumbria.

Cllr Nicholson, a member for Cockermouth North, spoke only to mutter 'hear, hear' in approval of the decision to take a lunch break.

He put his phone away after lunch but was seen doodling on the agenda papers during the afternoon session.

Cllr Nicholson, who was elected in 1997, admitted after the meeting that he had been playing solitaire, checking his bank account and looking at emails, but insisted he was still 'concentrating'.

He said: 'What you've got to understand is I get these papers a week before the meeting. I know them inside out. I don't think it truly affected anything I needed to concentrate on.

'I listened to [the debate] carefully. I'm the type of guy that gets terribly bored and switch off. I can lose my focus. It sounds silly but I'm so used to working at 100mph. I know it gives a bad impression.'

The incident is the latest in a string of embarrassments for local councillors, who have been caught playing computer games during important meetings and phoning sex lines on company phones.

Cllr Nicholson's actions were criticised a local government watchdog, who described it as an 'insult' to voters.

Steven Atkinson, of Is It Fair Cumbria, said: 'It just shows the seriousness with which [councillors] take the debate. They don't care. 

'It's an absolute insult to the people who elected him to put him in that position. 

'He should make his apologies and attempt to explain himself to the electorate as I doubt they want a person who's more interested in their mobile phone than the budget - it's appalling. 

'No wonder there's such apathy from voters.'

Labour Councillor Len Davies, Mayor of Allerdale, added that Cllr Nicholson had 'let down those who had trusted him to act on their behalf'.

He said: 'An apology would be appropriate. He's certainly not acting with due diligence. 

'To prevent this happening again there must be a clear message that councillors must focus on what's being discussed.'

Councillor James Airey, leader of the Conservative Group for Cumbria County Council, said he was 'surprised' by Cllr Nicholson because he had 'helped a lot' in drawing up the budget proposals being discussed.

He added that he had seen members from all parties losing concentration during debates.

He said: 'Members from all parties were reading newspapers at one point. We have got to sharpen our act up. It was an important debate and people should fully concentrate.'  

When asked if Cllr Nicholson would be punished, Cllr Airey said: 'I spoke to Eric and he has apologised. 

'He was aware of everything that went on in the budget debate and he has promised me that he won’t do any personal work in important council debates again.' 

It comes two months after Tory MP Nigel Mills admitted having a ‘game or two’ of Candy Crush on his taxpayer-funded iPad during an important meeting in Parliament.

Mr Mills, the MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire, was supposed to be listening to experts give evidence at a meeting of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee in December.

However, he spent much of the two-and-a-half-hour meeting closely studying his iPad and swiping the screen as he tried to complete levels of the popular game. 

And last month it emerged Robert Bleakley, who has an £11,000 allowance as a representative of Tyldesley in Wigan, Greater Manchester, had run up a £2,500 bill calling sex chatlines.

The Independent councillor also used a work computer to watch pornography and did not bother attending a meeting in five months.

In September it was discovered Councillor Robert Bleakley, a representative of Tyldesley in Wigan, Greater Manchester, had racked up a £2,400 taxpayer-funded phone bill after sending vile messages and calling premium rate sex lines.
