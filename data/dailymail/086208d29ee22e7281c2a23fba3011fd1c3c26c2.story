'Good and loving': Alcoholic Ann Lupton beat her senile mother to death at her home in Preston

An alcoholic who beat her senile mother to death could be free in just two months after a judge said she deserved 'mercy'.

Marie Hothersall, 83, died in hospital two months after her 54-year-old daughter Ann Lupton launched a savage drunken attack at her home in Preston, Lancashire on July 23 last year.

But after the mother-of-six pleased guilty to manslaughter, Judge Alistair Macduff said he was able 'to show mercy, some might say leniency' to a woman he described as 'good and loving', and remanded her in custody for six months, of which she may only have to serve eight weeks.

Lupton, who previously admitted drinking a bottle of wine or half a bottle of spirits every day for almost 12 years, inflicted a catalogue of injuries on her mother 'consistent with forceful slapping, punching, kicking or stamping'.

Mrs Hothersall was found on the floor of her home by a support worker the morning after the attack suffering from two black eyes, a fractured hip, a large lump on her head, and swollen hands which had turned black from bruises. She died in hospital two months later.

But despite her crime, Lupton’s father told the court the death may have been a 'blessing' before the judge passed a sentence he described as 'merciful'.

Jailing Lupton at Liverpool Crown Court today, Mr Justice Macduff said: 'Forgiveness and compassion are wonderful human qualities and are even more to be commended in a society which appears to many people to value retributive instincts even more highly.'

'I can tell you that I am going to pass a merciful sentence so that your release back into the community and into the care of your wonderful family will not be too far into the future,' he said.

'I need to explain why, although I cannot release you immediately, I am able to show you the mercy, some may say leniency, which I believe you deserve. Over the years you had a good and loving relationship with your mother,' he added.

The court earlier heard how Lupton became 
‘agitated and aggressive’ when drunk, and she initially told police her mother had
 injured herself falling out of bed.

Just
 minutes after neighbours reported hearing screams and banging, she 
messaged her husband saying: 'Mum is a nightmare! Lol xx'

When her husband phoned her at around 8pm, Lupton said her mother was still being 'stubborn and hard work'.

At
 about 10pm neighbours heard more thumping and banging that sounded like
 'someone being knocked against the wall', the court heard.

Mr Reid added: 'At about 1.10am he heard loud banging, thumping and shouting coming from the victim’s bedroom... He described it as 'so loud it sounded like it was coming through the walls'.'

The sentence comes less than a fortnight after Mr Justice Macduff sentenced Emma Parr to ten months in prison for killing her mother Carol in an almost identical attack.

Parr, 38, who was suffering depression at the time, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Carol, 62, and was shown sympathy by the judge for being a ‘loving and caring person’.

Sentencing Lupton, Mr Justice Macduff said: 'Unhappily, as you well know, there were two very sad features of your relationship in recent times... You had sunk into deep alcoholism and your mother, by now aged 83 years, developed severe dementia. This made her difficult and unreasonable.'

'Your drink and her dementia coincided with tragic consequences on the night of July 23 last year... What is clear is that you inflicted a dreadful beating on your mother, as a combination of two things - your alcoholic state and your mother’s behaviour which frustrated and provoked you into anger.'

He added: I accept that it is your alcoholism which has been directly responsible for your actions on that evening. That does not excuse but does explain... Like your wider family, I have a great deal of sympathy for you. You will suffer a life sentence whatever I do today.'

He went on to say: 'I know that you will have to live with your dreadful actions for the rest of your life. To that extent, you are already being punished.'

Lupton wept in the docks as the judge passed sentence, before had wished her ‘good luck’.

Mr
 Justice Macduff added: 'I am entirely satisfied that what you did on 
take dreadful was the product of your illness and that through it all 
you continued to love your mother and she you...Thus I can apply clemency and mercy when sentencing you.'
