Splashing about: Retailers of wet weather gear have profited enormously from the soggy weather

The washout spring and summer may have meant misery for the High Street shops as they were forced to start the sales early.

But it has not been all bad news for the retailers – wet weather gear is booming with sales up as much as 400 per cent on 2011.

Marks & Spencer, which has suffered dire slump in general merchandise 6.8 per cent this spring, is selling a rain mac every minute, as shoppers adjust their wardrobes to cope with the rain.

Lightweight parkas are also proving popular because they are more versatile and can be used everywhere from the school run to music festivals.

A spokesman said: ‘Our Stormwear Mac sales are up 114 per cent on this time last year. Price points range from £39.50 for a plain coloured mac to £45 for a printed style.

‘We have sold 292 per cent more umbrellas compared with last year. Festival parkas are also up 48% on last year with the animal print parka selling 50% more than a similar style on sale this time last year.’

Although the terrible weather from March to July caused a slump in clothing and footwear prices by 4.2 per cent, sales of umbrellas, raincoats and wellington boots are sky high.

Debenhams revealed sales of umbrellas have soared by as much as 400 per cent and 100 macs a day are being sold.

Online retailer Amazon said it too had been deluged with demand from Britons trying to adapt to the unseasonably bad weather.

Sales boom: Amazon has seen a 93% increase in the sales of raincoats this year compared to last year

A spokesman said: ‘There has been a 93 per cent increase in the sales of raincoats this year compared to last year.

‘Sales of umbrellas are almost five times higher and purchases of wellington boots have increased by over 150 per cent year on year and the bestselling brand is Hunter.’

Bestsellers include the Fulton Lulu Guinness Birdcage Umbrella and Cath Kidson’s Cag In A Bag raincoat.

The Cambridge Raincoat Company has also seen its sales leap by 312 per cent.

It has traditionally been a popular choice for cyclists because of its longer design, which protects those on a bike in wet weather.

But with torrential rain and gales ordinary shoppers are increasingly opting for the extra protection it affords.

Owner Sally Guyer said: ‘Sales for 
May, June and July this year are up 312 per cent on the same period last
year thanks largely to the unseasonal weather.

‘The
raincoats also seem to be reaching a wider audience beyond the 
cyclists, acting as a great festival cover up thanks to the practical 
qualities of the design, which is windproof and water resistant.’
