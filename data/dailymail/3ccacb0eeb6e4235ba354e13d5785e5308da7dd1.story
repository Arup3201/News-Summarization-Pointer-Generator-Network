Tammy Devine, 39, received a letter accusing her of being involved in the accident despite the fact that she only stopped to help victim with a broken arm

A good Samaritan who stopped to help a pedestrian who was nearly killed during a car crash has been told she must pay to clean up after the accident.

Tammy Devine, 36, was driving through Hathershaw, in Oldham, last month when she saw  the crash and stopped to help.

Miss Devine, a mother-of-two, then stayed with the victim, who suffered a broken arm, until emergency services arrived.

However last week she received a letter from Oldham Council accusing her of being involved  and ordering her to pay for cleaning up.

Miss Devine said: 'It was absolutely horrible when I opened the letter. I thought to myself, I have not been involved in a crash, what's going on?

'When I called the council to see what had happened and they mentioned Ashton Road I was shocked because I stopped to help someone.

'I said to police when I called them that I'm worried about helping anyone ever again if it means I'll get a fine.'

CCTV footage taken at the scene of the accident shows the moment the victim narrowly avoids being killed as an out-of-control car jumps the curb before hitting a lamppost just in front of her. 

In the letter, Oldham Council said Miss Devine's Vauxhall Corsa had been involved in the collision, when in fact the crash had been between a blue Audi and a black Mercedes.

Miss Devine stopped to help the woman, who suffered a broken arm, and stayed with her until an ambulance came. However last week she was sent a letter telling her she was being fined £457

Miss Devine said she has been contacting Greater Manchester Police since she got the letter last week, but received no response until reporters contact the force.

Officers have now admitted there was a mistake, apologised and agreed to cancel the fine. 

Oldham Council said they acted on information given to them by Greater Manchester Police.

A GMP spokesman said: 'After looking into this matter we can confirm that Tammy Devine had no involvement whatsoever in the road traffic collision that occurred on Ashton Road on August 13.

'Upon arrival at the scene, officers have taken the details of all the vehicles present which unfortunately included Miss Devine's car as she had pulled over to help the injured pedestrian. 

'As a result of this the details of the car were passed on to Oldham Council's Highways Department.

'Greater Manchester Police would like to offer its most sincere apologies to Miss Devine for any distress and inconvenience this may have caused her or her family.'

After being contacted by reporters, Greater Manchester Police acknowledged they had given the wrong information to the council, and apologised to Miss Devine
