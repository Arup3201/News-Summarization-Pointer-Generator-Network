Police said there is no indication at this time that alcohol was a factor and they don’t know who was driving the car the family was in.

Travis Straton, 25, the father of Jonathan Ayres, also was killed. He was from Onancock, Virginia.

The truck slammed into the car on the passenger side and rolled over on the vehicle before coming to rest. The Ayers were returning home from Baltimore where they had visited family.

Police say there was no snow at the time of the crash, but that temperatures were extremely low.
