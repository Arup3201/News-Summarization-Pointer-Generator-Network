Two of Britain’s largest ever twins are hitting the big time again after growing a massive sunflower three times taller than them.

Billy and Charlie Laundon, four, were among the biggest twins ever born in the UK, when they tipped the scales with a combined birth weight of 16lbs and 3oz.

The pair from Hartlepool have now helped to grow an impressive 9ft plant in their grandfather’s back garden.

Charlie, born 8lbs and 12oz, and Billy, who came two minutes later at 7lbs and 7oz, have diligently cared for the flower after planting it with grandfather Colin Brown.

Semi-retired driver Mr Brown, 61, said: 'They planted two but this one is the biggest.

'Billy and Charlie are always helping me in the garden. They love it and they love being outside.

'It is the first time we have grown them, but I thought I would give it a go. Billy and Charlie water it every Sunday when they come round for their dinner.'

Parents Laura and Peter, both 35, did not know she was expecting until she was 12 weeks pregnant, and were shocked to find out she was expecting twins, who were born on May 4, 2010.

Twins usually have a lower birth weight than single babies, on average they tip the scales at around 5lb.

The biggest twins ever born in the UK were Thomas and Grace Hughes, weighing a combined 18lbs and 3oz, from Newton-le-Willows, in Merseyside, in 2002.
