A farmer left housebound by a back injury and painful ulcers before dying from cancer was stripped of his incapacity benefit by Government assessors who ruled he was fit to work.

Despite being in constant pain, David Coupe lost his £50 a week payment, leaving his family reliant on friends and family for handouts, and unable to afford to heat their home.

Although the 57-year-old tried to appeal the ruling by the Department for Work and Pensions, which was based on evidence including a report by Atos, the private company behind fitness-to-work tests, he was told it would take a year.

Constant pain: Farmer David Coupe, 57, died from a rare form of cancer while he waited for the decision to strip him of his £50-a-week incapacity benefit to be overturned. Mr Coupe was ruled fit for work despite being housebound as a result of a painful back injury,  diabetes, ulcers and a heart condition.

In August Mr Coupe was diagnosed with cancer and given just weeks to live. Although he tried to bring the appeal forward the request was refused.

Mr Coupe's health rapidly deteriorated and he lost both his sight and hearing before dying earlier this month with his family at his bedside.

His funeral will be held today.

Now Mr Coupe's wife Lyn has vowed to overturn the decision, with the backing of Labour MP Dennis Skinner - who highlighted the case to the House of Commons, describing Atos as 'unfit for purpose' and a 'heartless monster'.

Prime Minister David Cameron has also said he would personally look into the "desperately sad" case.

Detemined: Widow Lyn Coupe has vowed to fight for justice in her husband's memory

Mr Coupe was assessed as fit to work in 
December last year, despite the fact he was seriously ill with diabetes,
 a heart condition and a badly injured back, which had left him in 
serious pain and unable to work for the last 24 years.

The former farmer and butcher from Calow, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire had also been rendered housebound by ulcerated legs.

'Atos decided he was capable of limited 
employment and his benefit was cut, which left us with just £71 a week,'
 said Mrs Coupe, also 57.

Much-loved: Mrs Coupe said her husband, pictured before his cancer struck, would 'do anything for anyone'

'He
 was called to the Job Centre late last year.They just took his blood 
pressure. They never checked his back or asked about his diabetes and 
the ulcers he had on his legs.

'The computer told them he hadn’t worked for 24 years. He had damaged his back working on a farm and his health deteriorated.

'He
 worked long hours on the farm. He would leave at 5am and some days I 
would not see him again until 11pm. He was devastated when he was unable 
to carry on working.'

Mrs Coupe said that the benefit cut had left the couple needing to borrow money from their friends and family.

'I was borrowing money off everybody,' said the mother-of one.

'We couldn’t afford to put the heating on last winter so we sat with with blankets round us.'

'David
 appealed against the ruling but was told a decision would take almost a
 year but he didn’t have a year. A short while later he was diagnosed 
with cancer and given just a few weeks to live.

'He was dying and he just kept saying "I wish I could win this case before I die" but he didn’t.

'He got a rare form of cancer which took his sight and his hearing before he died.

'His doctors and specialist nurses wrote to the firm but never received a reply. Five weeks before David died I contacted Atos.

'I told them my husband didn’t have long to live but they wouldn’t bring the appeal forward.'

Mrs
 Coupe said that two weeks before her husband's death, on October 11, 
the Department for Work and Pensions had awarded him a Disability Living
 Allowance of £134.40 a week because of his illness.

'He was deemed fit for work yet the DWP admitted he needed constant care because of his cancer,' she said.

Memories: Mrs Coupe said that all her husband wanted was to stay alive long enough to see his money paid back

Mrs Coupe described her husband as a 'much-loved man who would do anything for anyone'.

She
 added: 'All David wanted to do was stay alive long enough to see them 
pay back the money he was entitled to. Sadly he didn’t live long enough.

'I’m
 bitter about what they did and I won’t let it rest. Other people can’t 
suffer like we did. David died waiting for an appeal.'

Fighting: Labour MP Dennis Skinner has highlighted the case to the House of Commons, describing Atos as 'unfit for purpose'. Prime Minister David Cameron said he would personally look into the 'desperately sad' case

Colin Hampton, co-ordinator at the Derbyshire Unemployed Workers' 
Centre, said: 'There should be a complete overhaul of the system.'

A spokesman for Atos Healthcare called it a 'terribly sad case', but said the Department for Work makes benefit decisions and manages the appeals process.

The spokesman added that Atos plays plays no role in appeals, and advice about the length of time an appeal might take or whether an appeal can be brought forward 
would not have made by Atos Healthcare.

If a change of condition is reported to Atos it is passed on to the DWP who decide whether or not a referal should be made.

A DWP spokesman said: 'Our sympathy goes out to the family of Mr Coupe during what is obviously a difficult time.

'A
 decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken following a
 thorough assessment and after consideration of all the supporting 
medical evidence we are given.'
