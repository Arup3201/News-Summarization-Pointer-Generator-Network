Footballers throughout the Premier League are today wearing special rainbow coloured laces to support Stonewall and Paddy Power's anti-homophobia campaign.

Arsenal already demonstrated their support for the issue in a television advert, and now they, as well as players from around the Premier League, can be seen wearing the laces in today's fixtures.

Mikel Arteta, Per Mertesacker, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski are just some of the names involved at The Emirates.

An FA statement on the campaign read: 'Like that of the Rainbow Laces campaign, The FA's message is simple: homophobia, like all forms of discrimination, is unacceptable.' 

Joey Barton is another advocate of the cause. The QPR midfielder told The Metro: 'There are always people who are going to complain – they will say blue is red for the sake of an argument.

'The key is getting the message out to the public that us lads are supportive of fellow pros and supporters, no matter what their sexual orientation.'

Speaking about the campaign to Arsenal.com, Arsene Wenger said: 'The sport is taking responsibility so perhaps our sport can be ahead of the trend in society. 

'In this aspect I don't think we are but at least we support it and I think it's important.

'I believe that we have a responsibility because people look at our game and see what kind of values we support. The fight against homophobia and any discrimination is very important and we have that responsibility.
