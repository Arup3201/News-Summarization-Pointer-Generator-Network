TV star Anna Ryder Richardson's zoo has been fined £70,000 over serious health and safety breaches following an incident which saw a mother and her young toddler hit by a falling tree.

Swansea Crown Court was told the celebrity interior designer and her husband and co-owner Colin MacDougall knew there were dangerous trees at their zoo in west Wales but had 'closed their eyes to the risk'.

The court heard Ms Ryder Richardson has ploughed up to £1million of her own money into Manor House Wildlife Park near Tenby, and is living with her family in a wooden hut within its grounds due to the venture's 'precarious' financial position.

Emma Davies-Hughes, 30, and her three-year-old son Gruff were crushed by a falling tree while visiting the wallaby enclosure at the wildlife park.

Ryder Richardson's company, Manor House Wildlife, admitted two breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act. MacDougall, 46, pleaded guilty to similar charges.

The company was fined £70,000, MacDougall was fined £4,000, and the couple must pay £37,500 in legal costs.

Judge Paul Thomas QC said: 'The defendants fell significantly below the required standards of safety - nothing effective was done to reduce those risks.'

The court was told the charges were not directly related to the injuries of Gruff and his mother.

It heard it was not possible to say the accident would not have happened even if a safety system had been in place.

Swansea Crown Court heard Ryder Richardson, 48, had poured up to £1million of her own money into the venture in Pembrokeshire, west Wales.

But the TV presenter and her husband were living in a wooden hut at the zoo after poor weather hit visitor numbers leaving them in a 'precarious' financial position.

Teacher Emma Davies-Hughes, 30, and her son Gruff, three, were petting the animals in a wallaby enclosure when the tree fell on top of them.

Gruff was left fighting for his life after the tree hit him on the head and had to spend three days in intensive care. His mother suffered injuries to her head leg, pelvis and arm.

Prosecutor Simon Morgan said: 'Gruff and his mother went to stroke one of the wallabies.

'Mrs Davies-Hughes did not see the tree falling and she was covered by branches and foliage when it hit her and the toddler.'

The court heard trained medic Aled Lewis who was visiting the park managed to bring Gruff back to life using heart massage.

He also revived Mrs Davies-Hughes who was knocked unconscious.

Both mother and son are still suffering from the devastating effects of the accident two years ago, a solicitor for the family said.

Ryder Richardson's company failed to act on reports that trees in the park were decayed and a 'high risk', the court was told.

Mr Morgan said: 'This company was 
guilty of significant failure in its obligation to the paying public 
including vulnerable individuals.

'Being in that environment was unsafe and the company knew it and closed its eyes to this,' he said.

Judge Paul Thomas was scathing in his condemnation of MacDougall's attitude in the wake of the incident.

He said a refusal to close the attraction had seen Pembrokeshire County Council act to order it closed on safety grounds.

In the 48 hours after the event, five potentially dangerous trees were felled in the enclosure where it happened.

He also highlighted surveys of which MacDougall was aware, and failed to act on, identifying potentially dangerous trees.

Earlier, the court heard that the guilty pleas were accepted on the basis that there was no causal link to the incident. But the judge questioned why MacDougall failed to act on surveys from an expert who advised action on a number of trees and warned that risk assessments were needed if new areas were opened to the public.

He said he believed MacDougall was 'shopping around to try to save money'.

'In my view, procrastination and fudge best seem to sum up the views at this stage,' he said.

He added: 'The defendant, in my view, fell very significantly below the proper standard.'

The court was told Ryder Richardson had made the zoo her 'life's work' after she opened it four years ago.

Christian Du Cann, defending, said: 'The accident cast a pall over the park and it is a matter of regret that it happened.

'The wildlife park has been their 
life's work and they are held in high regard in zoological circles in 
allowing visitors to view endangered animals.'

Nicholas Collins, solicitor for the 
Davies-Hughes family, said after the case: 'The family continues to live
with the devastating effects of the accident on a daily basis.'

After the hearing the couple said in a statement: 'Our primary concerns have been for Gruff and his mother and we are glad they are making a recovery.

'Our thoughts and best wishes are with them.

'Our tree management system could and should have been better.'

Pembrokeshire Council welcomed the heavy financial penalties on the company.

A spokesman said: 'These sentences reflect the fact that the park and Colin McDougall have failed over a number of years to manage the risks posed to the paying pubic and employees.

'There was a failure to assess and actively manage the tree population to ensure the park was safe.

'These failures created the 
environment in which a 25-metre beech tree fell trapping and seriously 
injuring a child and his mother.'
