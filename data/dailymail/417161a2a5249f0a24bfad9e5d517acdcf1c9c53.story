The man who subjected Australian teenager Madeleine Pulver to 12 hours of terror when he attached a fake collar bomb around her neck was jailed for a minimum of 10 years today.

As he jailed Paul Douglas Peters, Judge Peter Zahra said in the New South Wales Supreme Court that the terror the 18-year-old would have felt ‘cannot be described’.

Wearing a rainbow-coloured ski mask, Peters, now 52, broke into her family’s £8million home in the wealthy Sydney suburb of Mosman on August 3 last year and strapped a black metal box around Madeleine’s neck with a bicycle chain.

Sent down: Paul Douglas Peters (pictured) has been jailed for a minimum of ten years after subjecting teenager Madeleine Pulver to 12 hours of terror when he attached a fake collar bomb around her neck

Deranged: Peters told a psychiatrist he had no memory of the crime, but suggested he had taken on the persona of a character in a book he was writing

A note attached to the device – which
was finally found to be a hoax – was an extortion aimed against her 
parents, Bill and Belinda Pulver, along with a warning that the box 
contained sophisticated plastic explosives.

The note added that Madeleine and her
family would suffer from a ‘tragically avoidable explosion’ if they 
failed to send ‘funds’ to a supplied email address.

Today Madeleine sat with her parents 
in the courtroom staring occasionally at the failed businessman as he 
wept in the dock while listening to the judge describe the fear that the
schoolgirl would have felt as bomb disposal experts worked carefully to
detach the device.

Referring to the note attached to the
fake bomb, the judge said: ‘The contents of the document…was to place 
the victim in fear that she would be killed.

‘He was armed. He concealed his face…(Madeleine) was extremely vulnerable. It was a deliberate act of extortion.’

Victim: Madeleine Pulver, who had a suspected bomb attached to her after a masked man entered her family's Mosman home in Sydney

Peters, who was carrying a baseball 
bat when he broke into the house, had told a psychiatrist that he had no
memory of the crime but suggested he had taken on the persona of a 
character in a book he was writing.

But the judge said it was 
‘unproductive to speculate’ why Peters chose Madeleine, who was 
approached by the masked intruder when she was doing her homework in her
bedroom, as his victim.

As Madeleine watched, Peters began to cry as Judge Zahra told of the unravelling of his life in the lead-up to his crime.

The court heard he had been left 
distraught by the breakdown of his marriage and career trouble, 
believing he had lost everything.

He told a psychiatrist that he had to
find ‘an ingenious way to trap myself’ because he was drinking heavily 
and knew he needed help. ‘I had to catch myself out,’ he told the 
psychiatrist.

‘I had to lay evidence along the way to trap myself.’

Millionaire's daughter Madeleine Pulver, 18, who was freed after spending hours with a 'bomb hanging round her neck'

The court was told that Peters had 
started to morph himself into John Chan, one of the characters in his 
book and he was looking for ‘dual revenge for Chan and for me,’ a 
defence the judge said he was ‘not prepared to accept’.

Among those in the court was police 
officer Karen Lowden, described as a ‘very courageous policewoman’ who 
supported Madeleine during her ordeal when she was ‘crying and scared 
for her life.’ 

Evidence was given that Peters was 
suffering from a bipolar disorder and was in a state of ‘isolation and 
personality disintegration’ when he committed the crime.

Although Madeleine’s parents said 
after the sentencing that they were still baffled why Peters had chosen 
their daughter as his victim, Crown Prosecutor Margaret Cunneen told the
court that he had simply ‘gone to the wrong house’, having initially 
intended to extort a wealthy trust beneficiary who also lived in Mosman.

Peters was arrested in Kentucky, USA, two weeks after the crime.

Sentencing Peters to 13 years and six
months in jail – with a minimum of 10 years to be served – Judge Zahra 
said the sentence called for a strong element of deterrence, both for 
the specific offender and this offender as an individual.

'The offender placed the victim in fear that she was going to die in order to export money from her family.

‘The victim was vulnerable, being 
entitled to the sanctuary of her own home…the terror she experienced can
only be described as unimaginable.’ 

Speaking outside the court, Madeleine 
said she was pleased with the sentencing and that she and her family 
could now look to a future ‘where Paul Peters’ name is not linked with 
mine.’

Her father said: ‘She’s a very, very 
special young lady who has handled herself with incredible poise and 
dignity throughout this trial.'
