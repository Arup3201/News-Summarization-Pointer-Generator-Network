The  gunman who killed two people in Copenhagen was today buried in a Muslim cemetery in the city, despite objections from the Islamic group that owns it.

Omar El-Hussein, 22, murdered two people last weekend following a bloody rampage through the Danish capital that ended when he was killed in a shootout with police.

The ceremony at the Islamic Society of Denmark was attended by approximately 500 mourners and sympathisers, before he was buried in a Muslim cemetery on the outskirts of the city.

Mourners: Stewards surround the hearse carrying the body of Omar El-Hussein, who murdered two people last weekend following a bloody rampage in Copenhagen

Coffin: The car was escorted from the Islamic Society's building in Copenhagen to a Muslim burial ground in the suburb of Brondby

Final journey: Ahmet Deniz, head of the Islamic Burial Fund's support group  said he had concerns before the ceremony about the burial

But Ahmet Deniz, head of the Islamic Burial Fund's support group told newspaper Jyllands-Posten, that he had concerns before the ceremony about the burial. 

He said that the group said it had considered denying a request by El-Hussein's parents to have him buried in their cemetery, but that its rules did not allow for it.

He added: 'My concern is over extremist attitudes and actions on both sides. Both from his friends and from young Danish people who perhaps could also riot later.'

The funeral was open to the public, but reports from the scene said it was mostly attended by young men, who were described as 'wearing large black coats with many of them having covered their faces'.

Before the ceremony, Copenhagen Police urging anyone attending to 'show appropriate respect' while Kasem Said Ahmad, who conducted the burial ceremony, said that he would require everyone to 'remain silent'.

Ahmad rejected  suggestions that a large turnout at the funeral would be a sign of support for the alleged killer.

He said: 'It is support for the family, not for him. I do not think that anyone is coming to pay homage to him.'

After the burial, controversial Salafist Adnan Avdic - who had previously called El-posed for pictures at the the plot.

Two people - a documentary maker and a volunteer security guard at Copenhagen's main synagogue - died in two separate shootings last Saturday and Sunday.

Plot: Controversial Avdic had previously called El-Hussein a 'hero' following the terror attack

Prayer: The funeral prayer was so well attended that many people had to stay outside the building

Soon afterwards, El-Hussein was then killed in a firefight with police which concluded a shooting spree that authorities say may have been inspired by the terror attacks in Paris last month. 

El-Hussein first gunned down film director Finn Nørgaard at a free speech debate in the city, but it is believed his target was Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist who has received numerous death threats for caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad. 

After fleeing the scene, El-Hussein then appeared nine hours later outside a synagogue in Copenhagen where he fired nine rounds with two hand guns, killing Jewish security guard Dan Uzan and wounding two police officers. 

Killer: El-Hussein, who was well known to police for violence and weapons violations, was killed in a shootout with police in his neighborhood of Norrebro, Copenhagen, following the attacks

Cemetery: The funeral was open to the public, but reports from the scene said it was mostly attended by young men, who were described as 'wearing large black coats with many of them having covered their faces'

Burial: Kasem Said Ahmad, who conducted the burial ceremony, said everyone would be required to 'remain silent' amidst fears of protests

El-Hussein was carrying two handguns when he was shot by a SWAT team early Sunday.

A Denmark native with Palestinian parents, El-Hussein had been in and out of prison for violence and weapons offenses and had recently served time for a stabbing on a commuter train, court documents revealed. 

Video emerged last week of El-Hussein competing in a Thai kick-boxing bout two years ago, looking toned and athletic.

Highly-skilled, he was known as ‘The Captain’ and hoped to turn professional. Instead, he started smoking marijuana heavily and became involved in tit-for-tat battles with rival gangs in the poor areas of Copenhagen.

In November 2013 he stabbed a man of 19 in the thigh and buttock on a train in an unprovoked attack. 

He was sentenced to two years in prison for grievous bodily harm – where he became radicalised.

The Danish Security and Intelligence Service, known by its Danish acronym PET, acknowledged this week that El-Hussein was flagged in September under a program meant to alert PET to 'inmates who are at risk of radicalization.'

What prompted prison authorities to sound the alarm is unclear, but PET said that the information gave the agency 'no reason to believe' that he was plotting attacks.

Earlier this week, Denmark's Prime Minister joined mourners at the funeral of Mr Uzan as hundreds gathered to pay their respects to the slain security guard.
