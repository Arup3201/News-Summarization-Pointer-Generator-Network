A 61-year-old disabled father-of-seven has died after a group of teenagers attempted to rob him then pushed him into oncoming traffic on a Texas intersection.

Sam Lee Morris was fighting for life when police found him laying unconscious in the road in the Oak Cliff district of Dallas on Saturday night, but he died of his injuries on the way to hospital.

The diabetes sufferer who walked with a limp was attacked by the teens nearby his home as he returned from a convenience store at around 10 p.m.

Police believe he made a weak attempt to fight off the culprits by swinging his grocery bag at them but got hit in the head and then pushed in front of a car. The driver of the car didn't stop, and authorities are now appealing for information on that person as well as the group of teens.

Detectives are using surveillance video from the nearby Elisha Pease Elementary school and local businesses to search for clues. Fox 4 News reported they had made at least one arrest in the case.

Morris' brother, Robert Morris, told the station he was shocked when he heard his brother had passed away, but wasn't surprised how it happened.

He said teens regularly harass the elderly in the neighborhood and while his brother probably put up a fight, he would have been overpowered because of his age and disability.

'When that happened I'm sure he was trying to get away from him but he couldn't,' Morris, who was out of town at a funeral when the attack took place, said.

Sam Morris' neighbor, Johnathan Nealy, agreed the young thugs often roamed the neighborhood.

'Every night you see teenagers like five or six yelling, music banging,' he said. 'Why you not at home? Don't you got school tomorrow? I know school is out but summer jobs? Something to occupy your time but they be in the streets.'

Robert Morris told Fox 4 that he and his only brother had been estranged for decades but a year ago the pair patched things up and the father-of-seven moved in with him from California.

He's said he was happy they were able to share one last year together.

'I have memories. That's all I got now. But other than that, best brother someone could ask for,' Morris told the station.
