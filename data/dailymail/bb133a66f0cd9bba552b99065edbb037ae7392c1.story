Zara performed a headgear hat trick this afternoon as she attended her third consecutive day of the Cheltenham Festival wearing a vibrant pink pillbox.

Looking cheerful as she arrived at the Gloucestershire race course to join in the annual St Patrick's Day Thursday, Zara matched the retro felt hat, a Philip Treacy piece she first wore at Sandringham on Christmas day in 2008, with a crushed velvet clutch in a complementary shade.

The bright pink accessories added a splash of colour to her otherwise all-black outfit of trench coat, knee-length boots and opaque tights.

Patrick’s atmosphere this side of the Irish Sea'

Zara's husband Mike Tindall accompanied his wife for a third day in a row too, and the two looked happy and relaxed as they embraced one another at the race course.

The two were joined by Chemmy Alcott, the Olympic skier whose career was almost ended in 2010 when an accident left her with a badly broken leg.

Chemmy and Zara became friends after being introduced by a shared sponsor some years ago, and Chemmy spent some weeks recuperating at Zara's house in the summer after her accident.

Zara chatted animatedly to the 29 year-old skier as they watched the day's seven races from the Royal Enclosure.

Cheltenham's St Patrick's Day celebration is a firm favourite with racegoing regulars, who are treated to 'plenty of craic' including live music and dancing alongside the seven scheduled horse races.

Organisers call it the 'best St Patrick’s atmosphere this side of the Irish Sea,' which will no doubt appeal to the fun-loving Tindalls.

A keen horsewoman herself, Zara competed on her horse Black Tuxedo at last week’s Tweseldown Horse Trials, and also rode to victory on Silver Lining at the same event.

The royal couple were among 50,000 fans who gathered to enjoy the first of four days of racing at Cheltenham.
