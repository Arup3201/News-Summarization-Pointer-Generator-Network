A month of gaffes by Nigel Farage has led to a slump in voter satisfaction with the Ukip leader.

Rows over breastfeeding, immigrants causing traffic jams and demanding a wreath at the Cenotaph have combined with allegations of a sex scandal involving the party's general secretary and a candidate.

A new poll today showed Mr Farage's net satisfaction rating has dropped sharply to -20, with supporters of other parties finding him a turn-off.

The latest IpsosMori survey reveals a dramatic fall in net satisfaction with Nigel Farage as Ukip leader

The new IpsosMori survey puts net satisfaction – the percentage of voters satisfied minus the percentage dissatisfied - in Mr Farage's performance as Ukip leader is at its lowest ever level at -20. Only 33 per cent are satisfied and 53 per cent dissatisfied.

This is down from a net score of -6 last month, and down sharply on positive ratings of 11 seen in May last year.

While Mr Farage remains very popular amongst Ukip supporters with 92 per cent satisfied, his ratings among the other parties' supporters have slipped, IpsosMori said.

Half of Tory supporters are unimpressed by Mr Farage, 66 per cent of Labour supporters, and 61 per cent of Lib Dems.

Mr Farage remains more popular that the other leaders, with only Ed Miliband seeing a slight rise in support this month

Sex education policy confusion

Dec 3: Nigel Farge: 'I've never advocated that policy. If somebody in Ukip in the past did, well, so be it, but I think that people need to have a rounded education and sex education is part of that.'  The party's website stated:  'Scrap sex and relationship education for children under the age of 11.'

Ostentatious breastfeeding 

Dec 5: Nigel Farage: 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.' 

Immigrants causing traffic jams

Dec 6: Nigel Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four.

'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.'

General secretary sex scandal 

Dec 8: Ukip general secretary Roger Bird suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate Natasha Bolter. He claims they slept together, she denies it. Doubts later emerge about her CV, with Oxford denying she studied there and questions about her teaching qualifications  

Rate an immigrant game

Dec 13: A Ukip game asks supporters to rate 'blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans' in a game – with prizes of cash and a Ukip golf umbrella. 

Weeding out the lunatics

Dec 14: Ukip candidates chief David Soutter: 'Half my job is spent not finding good candidates to stand, it is weeding out the lunatics, the people who shouldn't be there.' 

Candidate quits over 'poofter' comments 

Dec 15: Kerry Smith forced to quit as Ukip candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock after being taped mocking gay party members as 'poofters', joking about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referring to someone as a 'Chinky bird'. 

Taking money from Brussels 

Dec 16: Ukip secures a £1.5 million pot of taxpayers' cash by forming a new European-wide political party.

Mr Farage courted controversy last month when he waded into the row over breastfeeding in public, after a mother at the London hotel Claridge's was asked to cover her baby's head with a napkin.

He suggested mothers of newborn babies should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding and might think about sitting in a corner when doing so.

The Ukip leader was also branded 'silly and dangerous' after blaming immigrants clogging up the M4 for him missing an event in Port Talbot.

The party has also been rocked by allegations that general secretary Roger Bird behaved inappropriately towards candidate Natasha Bolter, including taking her for dinner and buying her a dress.

And Kerry Smith was forced to resign as the party's general election candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock – which Mrs Bolter hoped to be selected for – after making a series of offensive comments.

In recordings of phone calls obtained by the Mail on Sunday, the would-be MP was said to have mocked gay party members as 'poofters', joked about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referred to someone as a 'Chinky bird'. Before quitting, Mr Smith had initially apologised and explained that he had been under great stress at the time of the comments and taking strong painkillers.

Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg today dismissed Ukip as 'just a movement of angry blokes' trying to become a political party.

On his LBC Radio phone-in show Mr Clegg said: 'Of all the excuses for this kind of bile and racist, homophoboic vitriol - 'I was on a sedative' - most people on a sedative don't become Alf Garnett on stilts, do they? Most people on sedatives go to sleep.

'But apparently if you are in Ukip, if you are on a sedative, you just become even more unpleasant.'

He added: 'What we are seeing in Ukip is what I always predicted would happen, which is that the more they try and become like a political party, rather than just a movement of angry blokes - it's almost always angry blokes in suits just saying they are against everything - and the more they are being pressed on what you would do and what you would agree on, the more the problems emerge.'

Mr Clegg's personal ratings are still in the doldrums, down to -40 in the latest poll.

The Lib Dems are on 9 per cent in the voting intention, behind Ukip on 13 per cent, with the Tories ahead on 32 per cent and Labour on 29 per cent.

Gideon Skinner, Head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI, said: 'One of the themes of the year has been the rise of the 'other' parties as a mirror to the weakness of the traditional three.

'Most attention has been paid to UKIP, who still claim third place, although their leader's popularity with voters beyond his own supporters has fallen.

'But it's not just UKIP, as we see this month with a high for the Greens, who are fishing in the same pool of disaffected Liberal Democrat voters who have been boosting Labour.'

Labour is under threat from Ukip in four key seats, a poll showed today.

Ed Miliband's party is under threat in Great Grimsby, Dudley North, Plymouth Moor View and Rother Valley.

Lord Ashcroft's poll found Labour was ahead in the seats, but only just.

He said: 'If the Labour Party is worried about them, it has good reason to be.'

In three of the seats he found Ukip ahead by up to six points on the standard voting intention question, and they were tied with Labour in Dudley. 

'It was only when people were asked how they would vote in their own constituency that Labour's lead reasserted itself: six points in Rother Valley, five points in Plymouth Moor View, three points in Dudley North and one point in Great Grimsby. 

In the seats as a whole the swing to UKIP was 13.5 per cent, Lord Ashcfroft added.
