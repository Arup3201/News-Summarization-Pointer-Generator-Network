A suspected homegrown terrorist published a new autobiography online tracing his path from a small town in Alabama where he had enjoyed a 'privileged’ life to a Somali militant group linked to al-Qaida.

Omar Hammami, also known as Abu Mansur al-Amriki, said that he is releasing the first part of his autobiography, ‘The Story of an American Jihaadi,’ now due to the ‘unpredictable nature’ of jihad.

The text featuring odd spellings and banal observations appeared on Wednesday, two months after Hammami issued a video in which he said he feared for his life because of his disagreements with other members of the al-Qaida group, called al-Shabaab.

Wanted: Omar Hammami, also known as Abu Mansur al-Amriki, was born in Alabama, but became radicalized after September 11 and ended up joining a group linked to al-Qaida

In the document, the 28-year-old Hammami describes the actions and deaths of numerous Americans, mostly from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, who also joined with the militant group in Somalia, according to ABC News.

‘Minnesota represented!’ he writes. ‘Those Minnesota brother have almost all left their mark on the [jihad] and most have them received martyrdom; while the rest are still waiting [sic].’

Hammami grew up in Daphne, Alabama. He joined al-Shabab in 2007.

Memoir: Hammami published his 127-page autobiography online through an organization called SITE Intelligence

His mother, Debra Hammami, recently told ABC News that even though she does not agree with her son’s ideology, the 127-page memoir was something of a comfort considering that she has not heard from him since he disappeared in 2006 after telling his family he was going to Dubai for work.

‘The silence has been devastating,’ she said.

In his memoir, distributed by the SITE Intelligence group, Hammami recounts his arrival in the capital of Somalia and his first meeting with the militants.

Hammami describes the training he received, including from one instructor nicknamed ‘The Spy,’ and jokes that the American drones buzzing overhead are ‘racist,’ targeting only 'white' people in Somalia.

Throughout, Hammami,  who is wanted by the FBI for his role in militant activities, is unrepentant for his decision to join the jihad and for his calls for violence against the West.

Warrior: Hammami moved to Canada in 2002 in hopes of reading 'blacklisted' books, and was embraced by the Somali community there

Looking back on his childhood, the 28-year-old writes that he was 'brought up like most of the children in America.' He celebrated Christmas and birthdays, and went hunting like one of the 'good old boys' on holidays.

He points out that, like Apple Corp. founder Steve Jobs, he is the product of a Syrian father - an engineer who moved to the U.S. - and American,  Southern Baptist mother.

A religious awakening in his teenage years, he says, led him to don a ‘turban in the Bible Belt post-9/11.’ In 2002, he quit his university studies and moved to Toronto to read 'blacklisted' Islamic books.

Recalling his arrival in Canada, Hammami writes: 'There are Tim Horten’s (sic) fast-food joints all over the place and people speak from their nose... We used to have a blast asking the Canadians we met: 'How ’bout that hockey eh? Wanna have a coffee at Tim Horten’s or should I get ya a Fresca?'

Fundamentalist: Hammami's friend Daniel Maldonado (pictured) was sentenced in 2007 to ten years in prison for being trained by terrorists

Eventually, however, the 28-year-old jokingly admits that he became addicted to Tim Horton's coffee, according to Metro News.

He was welcomed into Toronto’s Somali community after marrying a young woman from it, but he found it had ‘Western defects,’ such as partiality to rap music.

Before long, Hammami decided to pursue his dream of becoming a jihadist and moved to Egypt, where he met a fellow fundamentalist from America, Daniel Maldanado, who paved the road to Somalia for him.

However, his wife and the mother of his daughter refused to follow him and asked for a divorce. 

'I told her that I live under a tree and that I am speaking from a mountain,' he writes. 'She didn’t seem to understand. She refused to come to Somalia and insisted that I should simply come back to Canada and live happily ever after (fat chance!)'

Maldonado was later arrested in Kenya and deported to the U.S., where in 2007 he was sentenced to ten years in prison for receiving military training from a terrorist organization.

Hammami dates the memoir May 16, 2012, and signs it, 'Still alive and well.'

Amended to the book are his answers to questions posed by a journalist. When he is asked if he has any final remarks, Hammami just says, ‘Viva la Revolution!’
