An illegal immigrant who fled war-torn Afghanistan after his father and brother were murdered by militants has lost his his fight to remain in the UK.

Najibullah Hashimi, 19, has been living in England ever since fleeing his war-torn homeland as a youngster, and has settled in well, achieving 13 GCSEs, settling down with a foster family and becoming a valued member of Rodmersham Cricket Club in Kent.

Mr Hashimi and crowds of supporters - including his foster father’s two young sons, who refer to the Afghan national as 'brother' - put forward a case for a right to remain in the UK last month, but today his foster father said Mr Hashimi had failed in his appeal to stay.

Mr Hashimi has settled happily in life in the UK with his foster family and is devastated that he has to go to Kabul

However, a letter from the Home 
Office has since confirmed Mr Hashimi has failed in his appeal, and will
be sent to Kabul - despite hearing his concerns that his life will be 
in danger.

Steve Griffiths, his foster father, 
today said Mr Hashimi, whom he described as 'a broken man', will be sent
to Kabul after a letter from the Home Office confirmed he would have to
leave the UK.

But he said his foster son's solicitor may yet contest the decision.

He said: 'We are all devastated. My family, my two boys - they cannot believe this.

'We are all very worried for Najib. He is part of our family, he is part of our lives - you couldn’t meet a nicer fellow.

'Najib has settled here, he has done 
very well in his education and he wants to give something back. There 
were so many people from throughout the community who went to support 
Najib ahead of the court hearing last month, we all want him here.'

Since arriving in the UK unable to speak English, Najibullah has embraced English life and is a cricket coach

He said Mr Hashimi and his solicitor have until the end of the week to consider what course of action they will take next.

Mr Griffiths said: 'Najib’s absolutely beside himself. He is worried for his life, and he doesn’t want to leave here.

'As we understand it, he will simply be flown to Kabul and then left to face it alone. It’s terrible.'

Last month’s tribunal was told how Mr
Hashimi, who moved to the UK unable to speak the language, was 'treated
like a son and a brother' to his foster family - Mr Griffiths, his wife
Michelle and their children, Tyler, 10, and Finlay, eight.

His girlfriend, 15-year-old Lucy Pearce, also said how she relied on her 'inspirational boyfriend' for support.

 

'I have lost one family five years ago - I don't want to lose the second.  When I am with them, it's like nothing has happened to me.'

She said: 'I don’t want to embarrass him but if he could stay I want to be with him as long as possible.'

Mr Hashimi said his mother, sister 
and uncle are living in Pakistan, but that he would be returned to 
Afghanistan if his appeal failed.

Referring to his foster family in Kent, he said: 'I have lost one family five years ago, I don’t want to lose the second.

'It is going to be heart-breaking. 
When I am with them [Tyler and Finlay] it’s like nothing has happened to
me. I don’t remember what has happened in the past.'

Mr Hashimi said he planned to become a teacher, but is also a regular at his local cricket club.

But Paul Duffy, for the Home Office, told the hearing in London how the decision could not hinge on a 'popularity contest'.

He said: 'We’re talking about a very 
popular person, he’s a credit to himself and his foster carers. But the 
ultimate problem in this context is it’s not a popularity contest.

'Even if the appellant’s family [his mother] is in Pakistan, the appellant is now an adult. He will return to Kabul.'

Mr Hashimi is 'beside himself' at the news that he has to move to Kabul, his foster father said today
