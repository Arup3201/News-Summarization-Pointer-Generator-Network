An elderly woman whose home was leveled by the Oklahoma tornado was reunited with her lost dog live on television when it emerged from the rubble as she was being interviewed.

As Moore resident Barbara Garcia was speaking about the devastation the tornado had wrought on her town, her little pet emerged from the rubble of her home.

Ms Garcia, who was clearly overcome with emotion, immediately declared God had answered her prayers.

It is one of the few pieces of good news to come out of Moore after the two-mile wide tornado ripped through the small town yesterday.

At least 24 people have been killed, including around 9 children.

Ms Garcia was standing in front of the wreckage of her home as she was interviewed by CBS News affiliate KWTV. 

As she looked over her shoulder to look 
at the scene of devastation - including wooden beams, household 
appliances and even a beached car - she said she believed her dog had been killed as he had not answered her calls.

The pensioner told interviewer Anna 
Werner: 'I was sitting on my stool holding my dog. This was the game 
plan all through the years to go in that little bathroom.

'I never lost consciousness and I hollered for my little dog and he didn't answer or didn't come.'

But just as she stoically reflected: 'This is life in the big city,' a member of the crew said: 'The dog, the dog.'

Ms Garcia turned around to see the head of her pet poking out from the 
bricks and mangled metal, scrabbling with its legs in a bid for freedom.

Helped by the TV crew, the pensioner managed to lift the debris to 
release the dark grey dog, which appeared to be a miniature schnauzer, and seemed uninjured.

She said: 'Help me! Oh bless your little bitty heart.

'Well I thought God just answered one prayer to let me be OK but he answered both of them because that was my second prayer.' 

Several families have lost pets in the devastating tornado.

On Tuesday McClain County Animal Response Team spokesperson Dr. Patty Mannas told KOCO-TV  that at least 50 had been pulled from the rubble.

'We’ve already reunited a few animals and animals with microchips have a very, very high percentage of being reunited with their families,' she said.

At least 91 people are feared dead after areas of the town, including the Plaza Towers Elementary School (pictured) were leveled by the tornado
