Police say a newborn baby found alive inside a trash bin in the central Illinois community of Jacksonville is in good condition.

Lt. Chris Johnson of the Jacksonville Police Department says 
authorities are still searching for the mother of the infant.

The baby 
was apparently placed in the trash bin Saturday morning, less than 12 
hours after it was born.

The baby was discovered in a trash bin in the 300 block of West Lafayette Avenue though authorities would not specify the exact location

Johnson says police aren’t releasing the gender of the baby or exactly where it was found.

However, the Springfield State Journal-Register reports that an employee taking out garbage heard a noise coming from
 inside the trash bin and discovered the unclothed baby inside.

They could say that the baby was found around the 300 block of West Lafayette north of downtown, an area populated mostly by docks, warehouses, and vacant houses.

The employee could not be reached for comment, while an area businessman declined to discuss the matter with reporters.

Police say it’s fortunate that the baby was found early in the 
morning before temperatures inside the bin climbed high enough to cause 
heat-related injuries.

Police told reporters the baby was sent to Passavant Area Hospital to be cared for, and was 'doing fine.'

The baby (not pictured) was found left just one block from a police station

The state's Safe Haven law allows for parents to anonymously leave a child 30 days old or younger at a hospital without facing legal charges under the condition the child has not been harmed.

The child was only one block away from a police station when discovered.

If police find whoever abandoned the child, they could face child endangerment felony charges.

'We want to be clear that our 
first priority now is the health and safety of the mother,' Johnson told reporters.
