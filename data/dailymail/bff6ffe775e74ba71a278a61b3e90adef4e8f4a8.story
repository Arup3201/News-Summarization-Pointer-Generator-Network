A killer doctor is suing one of his victim’s sons for heckling him as he was about to give a speech, forcing him to abandon the event and miss dinner.

Daniel Ubani, who was working as an overseas locum GP, gave victim David Gray, 70, ten times the recommended amount of diamorphine in 2008.

Mr Gray’s sons Stuart and Rory disrupted an event where Ubani was speaking in Germany, calling him a ‘charlatan’ and ‘killer’.

Now disgraced Ubani – who can still practise in Germany, where mention of his role in Mr Gray’s death is forbidden under strict ‘data protection’ laws – is demanding almost 3,400 euros, equivalent to £2,800 compensation. 

Confronted: Daniel Ubani is heckled by the two sons of one of his victims, David Gray, in Germany in 2010. Stuart Gray, pictured right, is stopped by security as he disrupts the disgraced doctor's speech

The sum covers the cost of dinner, expenses and the fee for his speech, which was not paid.

In 2010, an inquest found that Mr Gray, of Manea, Cambridgeshire,  had been unlawfully killed and an arrest warrant was issued for  Ubani.

But the doctor had returned to Germany and a deal was reached under which he was sentenced  there – receiving a nine-month  suspended jail term and fine for a lesser charge of causing death by medical negligence.

He was banned from practising in the UK after being struck off by the General Medical Council.

However, Ubani has been able to continue working in Germany because, although the country’s equivalent of the GMC would like him to be banned, doctors are licensed by their local council.

Anger: Rory Gray (right) and his brother Stuart (left) disrupted a speech he was giving at a conference on plastic surgery in the German town of Lindau in 2010, calling him a 'charlatan and killer.'

After Ubani, 71, was banned from practising in the UK following the inquest, Mr Gray’s sons discovered their father’s killer was giving a speech on plastic surgery in Lindau, Bavaria.

Brothers Stuart, now 54 and a GP in the West Midlands, and scientist Rory, 49, who lives in Germany, attended the event in June 2010 to confront him.

During the incident, Ubani replied: ‘Show me the doctor who has not made a mistake.’

Now
 Rory Gray’s lawyers have received a letter from a court in Lindau 
saying Ubani is seeking 3,398 euros plus costs. Mr Gray is liable 
because he lives in Germany, where he works for its equivalent of the 
Meteorological Office.

He said: ‘Ubani’s move beggars belief but it is not a surprise because he has told so many lies.

Tragedy: David Gray died after being given a massive overdose of painkillers by Dr Ubani

‘He has no moral compass or integrity – what sort of person would commit an unlawful killing then try to extricate money from his victim’s family?’

Mr Gray said he had obtained paperwork showing Ubani was only qualified to run a cosmetic surgery clinic before he came to the UK – but was able to move to the UK under European law because he had a German medical licence.

‘He pretended to have medical knowledge he didn’t have in order to work in the UK to make money,’ Rory said.

‘There is no evidence he trained or qualified to be  a GP.’

Nigerian-born Ubani, who is still allowed to practise as a plastic surgeon in Witten, an industrial town in Germany’s Rhineland, has given Mr Gray two weeks to answer his  case, which could lead to a full court hearing.

Mr Gray said Ubani had already made two unsuccessful attempts in the German courts to sue him and take out an injunction  preventing his family from speaking out.

But the third case has now been allowed to proceed. ‘I am defending it, of course,’ he said. His brother Stuart, who lives in Kidderminster,  Worcestershire, said: ‘Rory is only liable because he’s living in Germany. After all Ubani has done to our family, this is the final insult.’

He added: ‘In Germany, data protection rules prevent anyone making public any details about what Ubani did to our father. In my opinion, Ubani has no morals – he’s a weasel.’

The inquest into their father’s death heard that Ubani was on his first shift in the UK as a locum when he killed the pensioner, whom he injected with 100mg of diamorphine – ten times the recommended  maximum dose.

Evidence at the hearing in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire,  suggested he had also inappropriately treated at least two other patients.

German police documents later showed neither the university where Ubani claimed to have studied nor the state examination office had a record of his ever having sat the state medical exam.

Horrified: Rory Gray (pictured with his girlfriend Ingrid Krautwurst) said it is 'disgusting' Dr Ubani is still allowed to practice after his he allegedly fed his father a massive overdose of pankillers
