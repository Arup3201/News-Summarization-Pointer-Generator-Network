Commons Speaker John Bercow spent £48,024.06 in just six months on travels around the UK and the globe

John Bercow has defied critics of his taxpayer-funded jet set lifestyle, and clocked up another £48,000 on travel in just six months.

The Commons Speaker flew business class to Burma and New Zealand before jetting off to Antalya on the Mediterranean, taking his total travel bill since the general election to almost £150,000.

The latest revelations about spending on planes, trains, taxis and hotels come after MailOnline last year exposed how he had clocked up trips to 20 countries since the election.

In the wake of the revelations about his travel costs, Mr Bercow pledged to publish his expenses in full.

From June to December last year, total travel and accommodation costs came to £48,027.06, with more invoices yet to arrive.

In six months Mr Bercow clocked up £1,200 on train travel for himself and aides, £1,959.75 on hotels and £34,550.05 on flights.

It includes £16,496.30 for Mr Bercow to fly business class from Heathrow to Burma, then on to New Zealand and back to the UK.

One night at the five star Langham Hotel in Auckland cost £229.60 for Mr Bercow and an aide. Two nights at the Intercontinental in Wellington cost another £624.15.

To add to the bill another £16,661.75 was spent flying three MPs and two members of staff to join Mr Bercow on his travels around Burma.

Then in August last year he spent £344.60 flying to Antalya in Turkey, and back again.

Travel by his official car cost £2,507.74 for six months, including a £388 from Westminster to Hertfordshire for an ‘outreach’ event.

He also took his taxpayer-funded limo to the Attitude magazine awards, costing £172.

The TaxPayers' Alliance's Dia Chakravarty told The Sun: ‘Politicians should not bill hard-pressed taxpayers for business-class flights and fancy hotels, particularly when the public finances are in such a state.

‘If trips abroad are absolutely necessary then costs must be kept down and good value for money sought.’

Since May 2010, Mr Bercow has spent almost £150,000 on travels as Speaker

MailOnline last year revealed Mr 
Bercow’s trips as Commons Speaker to Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Greece, 
India, USA, South Africa, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Lithuania, Austria 
and Romania.

They were at the invitation of foreign parliaments but the UK taxpayer picked up the bill.

In
 one of the most extraordinary revelations, days after the 2010 
election, Mr Bercow took his official car on a £84.31 round trip to tour
 the offices of the expenses watchdog Independent Parliamentary 
Standards Authority (IPSA) which is just one mile from Parliament.

Before
 his latest jaunt to Burma and New Zealand, Mr Bercow’s most expensive 
flights included £11,252.81 for him and two aides to fly business class 
to fly to Ottawa in September 2010, £6,155.46 for two business class 
seats to New Delhi in India in August 2011 and £8,429.86 for the Speaker
 and an official to fly business class to Washington and economy back to
 London in February last year.

On
 a flight back from Cape Town in August 2012, Mr Bercow and a colleague 
had their business class seats upgraded to first class. The flights for 
the trip still cost £9,625.98.

Questions
 were first raised about Mr Bercow's foreign jaunts after it emerged 
that he used a speech to the Romanian Parliament in May to suggest 
eastern European migrants show 'more aptitude and commitment' to work 
than British people.

The revelations came amid growing anger among MPs at their treatment at the hands of Mr Bercow during debates in the Commons.

Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger said at the time that he feared for Britain’s reputation around the world if Mr Bercow is acting as its ambassador.

He said: ‘Given that he seems to be anti-MPs, it is a little rich to discover that he is spending thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money, presumably being as rude as he can to other countries.

‘Given his performance in the House, I hate to think what he is saying to Members of Parliament and officials around the world.’

A spokesman for Mr Bercow said: 'One 
of the Speaker’s duties is to represent Parliament at home and abroad. 
John Bercow MP is committed to encouraging public engagement with 
Parliament and, within the UK, he visits universities, charities and 
other organisations to explain and promote the work and role of the 
House of Commons.

'The 
vast majority of travel is economy class, except for long haul flights 
and where other classes may be best value for money or meeting timing 
requirements. In line with the Speaker’s commitment to greater 
transparency these costs are published on a quarterly basis.

'Trips
 abroad are following invitations from other parliaments and to attend 
international parliamentary conferences. The visit to Burma was at the 
invitation of the Burma’s Parliamentary Speaker, Thura U Shwe Mann, and 
Aung San Suu Kyi.'
