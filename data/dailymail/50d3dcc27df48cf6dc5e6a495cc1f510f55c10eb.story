Jose Mourinho insisted Chelsea’s comfortable win over Tottenham proves his side can cope without Diego Costa.

The Spain international was suspended for Wednesday night’s clash, but the Blues hardly missed their first-choice striker as Didier Drogba produced a virtuoso display.

And even when Drogba was substituted in the second half, his replacement Loic Remy scored an exceptional goal to seal victory.

‘We need Costa, but I think our mentality is the right mentality,’ said Mourinho. ‘We don’t have a player? We don’t cry about it. You give confidence to the others and the others respond in the best way.’

Costa is available for Saturday’s clash against Newcastle, meaning match-winner Drogba could find himself back on the bench at St James’ Park.

However, Chelsea will be without key midfielder Nemanja Matic, who picked up his fifth yellow card of the season on Wednesday night, through suspension.

But like the Blues coped without Costa, Mourinho insists his table-toppers can deal without their midfield lynchpin this weekend.

‘Matic is suspended? No problem, no problem,’ said Mourinho

‘We’ll play another one, like Diego Costa. Did you remember Diego Costa tonight? I didn’t. We give confidence to the other people.

‘We don’t cry when somebody cannot play. Obviously Matic is playing fantastically well for us. But that’s the way we think. To forget him.

‘December is a difficult month and it’s almost impossible for players to play every game this month - certainly later in the month so I have to change some players.

‘Of course, Diego Costa is already rested and now Matic is suspended for one game so he will be rested.’

Spurs still haven’t won at Stamford Bridge since 1990, where Gary Lineker scored the winner - and Mourinho joked: 'I think Lineker is happy with that.’

Meanwhile, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino insisted his players believed they could end their 24-year Stamford Bridge hoodoo.

‘If you watch the game again, I think the answer is easy: we believed,’ said the Argentine.

‘We showed we believed we could get a positive result, but this is football. The first chance they created, they scored. The second chance, the second goal.’
