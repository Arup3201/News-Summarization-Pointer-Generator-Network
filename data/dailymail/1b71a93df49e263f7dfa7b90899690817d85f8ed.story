A man who plotted to kill his ex-girlfriend and make it look like she was mauled by a bear tried to hire someone to kill her in a staged car crash.

Clyde Gardner originally planned to kill a bear, skin it and wear the pelt while using its claws to kill the woman as she took out her rubbish.

The 57-year-old junkyard ownerâ€™s plan included him wearing the bear's paws on his feet so no human footprints would be left behind.

Gardner had carefully watched his ex-girlfriend's movements, hiding in the woods with binoculars to learn her routines, prosecutors said.

It began after she kicked him out of the house they shared in Malone, New York, near the Canadian border. But he abandoned his first plan.

He then gave a friend a picture of the woman, her vehicle registration number and $500 toward a $15,000 bounty to kill her in a car crash.

Gardner was an experienced demolition derby driver and advised the man how to make it look like an accident.

Gardner told him if the crash didn't kill the woman, he should take a piece of broken glass and slit her throat, Elizabeth Crawford, prosecuting, said.

The acquaintance went to police, who sent him back wearing a hidden recorder to get Gardner on tape talking about the grisly plan.

Gardner said at sentencing he was drunk and was going to call off the hit once he sobered up and realised what he had set in motion.

He and the woman had been together about five years and had a child, but it was an abusive and violent relationship, prosecutors said.

The woman repeatedly broke up with him and kicked him out last autumn.

The case was scheduled for trial in July but Gardner took a plea deal. Peter Dumas, defending, has not yet commented on the outcome.

Gardner was sentenced to five to 15 years in prison and will have a 20-year order of protection preventing contact with the woman until 2031.
