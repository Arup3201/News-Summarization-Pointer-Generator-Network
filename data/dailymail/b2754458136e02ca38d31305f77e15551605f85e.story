As World Number One, he'd already set the tone on the green. And Rory McIlroy duly delivered a typically barnstorming performance when it came to the after party, as well. 

After Team Europe lifted the trophy yesterday evening at the Ryder Cup, the topless Northern Irish golfer got into 'the Scottish spirit' by donning a  red tartan kilt and an orange-coloured wig.

And he wasn't the only member of Team Europe who took advantage of the chance to have a well-deserved little kickback after the impressive victory.

The atmosphere was summed up when Welshman Jamie Donaldson - hailed as one of the main successes of the tournament - was asked by reporters whether the win had sunk in and he replied: 'No, because I'm still drunk.'

Among the wild celebrations that ensued in Perthshire, there was exploding champagne, making friends with police officers and even the excuse to nearly drop off to sleep at a press conference.

Is that you, Rory? The golfer got into the Scottish spirit during the after party in Gleneagles by donning a tartan kilt, a bright orange wig - and no top. He is pictured with Scottish team member Stephen Gallagher

They might not have been triumphant - but that didn't stop U.S golfers Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson from joining in with the Scottish-themed attire

Meanwhile, Lee Westwood made no secret of all the fun he was having by posting several images on Twitter - including this one, of being given a lift home by police

And it wasn't just the victorious who got into the party mood. U.S. golfers Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson also joined in with fancy dress, posting a photo of themselves in traditional kilts and wigs on Instagram.

McIlroy had also posted a photo of his Scottish-themed outfit to the site, saying: 'Got into the Scottish side of things'.

Earlier in the day, the World Number One had started the celebrations early when a bottle of champagne popped prematurely, spraying all over him and Graeme McDowell.

In hilarious footage, the pair were filmed looking on at the match between Zach Johnson and Victor Dubuisson when the bubbly suddenly exploded.

McIlroy re-posted the video - which was captioned 'The only bad shot Rory McIlroy made all week!' - saying 'I swear this never usually happens!'

Meanwhile, Lee Westwood made no secret of all the fun he was having, by posting a series of pictures online - one of which showed him getting a lift home with police officers.

The 41-year-old had appeared a little worse for wear as he faced reporters at a conference earlier on Sunday evening.

At one point, he looked so dazed  that it looked like he might fall asleep - until a champagne cork popped off and woke him with a startle. 

Welshman Jamie Donaldson said he was 'still drunk' when asked by reporters if the win had sunk in 

In the video, Westwood is seen seen giggling and smiling - and pulling some hilarious faces - before appearing to almost drop off.

He then pours himself a well-deserved drink, much to the delight of cameras at the conference.  

Westwood clearly continued to enjoy himself, later tweeting a photo of him getting a lift home with police officers.

And this morning, he attempted to cure his hangover by having a so-called 'Breakfast of Champions' - including eggs, bacon, beans and sausages - a picture of which he posted to Twitter.

He also shared one of his funny 'flashbacks' with his followers, describing how he sung Hey Jude with the band.

After a weekend of twists and turns, Europe captain Paul McGinley lifted the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. 

The win - 16½-11½ - is Europe's eighth Ryder Cup Victory.
