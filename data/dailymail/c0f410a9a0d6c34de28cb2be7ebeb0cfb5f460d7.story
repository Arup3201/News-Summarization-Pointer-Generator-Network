Upon arrival, police issued an ‘out of control event’ direction and teens, some as young as 14, spilled out of the house onto the road.

The 120-person strong crowd soon became aggressive, throwing bottles at police and assaulting two female officers. However, the officers did not sustain any physical injuries.

Four people, aged 14 to 17 years, were transported to the Ipswich watch house and charged with various offences such as public nuisance and assault or obstruct police.

A further three teenagers were issued with infringement notices for public nuisance.
