Ed Balls appears determined to shed his tough man reputation by shedding a few tears

Labour bruiser Ed Balls it seems cannot stop blubbing.

The shadow chancellor has previously 
claimed to have been moved to tears by Antiques Roadshow, the Sound of 
Music and a cartoon version of Robin Hood.

Now in his latest attempt to prove 
that he is really a big softie, the 45-year-old claims he keeps crying 
while watching US sitcom Modern Family.

Together with his public boasts of 
being a great cook –  14-hour pulled pork South Carolina barbecue being a speciality – and 
learning to play the piano, Mr Balls seems determined to persuade voters
he is not the political hardman of Westminster legend.

As one of Gordon Brown’s closest 
advisors Mr Balls has a reputation as a bruiser who regulalrly briefed 
against colleagues when Labour was in power.

But after losing out to Ed Miliband for the Labour leadership, he has made a concerted effort to show off his softer side.

In a new interview with House 
magazine, which is circulated around Parliament, he reveals Modern 
Family is one of his favourite series.

‘The reason why the programme is so brilliant is there's a little bit of [lead character] Phil Dunphy in all of us,’ he said.

But he went on to claim to have been 
moved to tears by an episode in which Phil and wife Claire drop off 
daughter Haley at university for the first time.

‘I cry every time I see that. Every 
time. It is all about the vulnerability of the daughter…and it captures 
the sort of dilemmas of parenting in a teenager.’

He went on: ‘Dads are supposed to be a
bit embarrassing, but of course you always think to yourself at key 
moments, “was that a bit embarrassing?”

‘But actually it’s sort of what you’re
supposed to do and it’s always really important to remember that you're
appreciated for being a bit embarrassing, even if it may not feel like 
it at the time.’

He reveals his own children Ellie, 
Joe, and Madelyn were left ‘appalled’ after one of his tweets was read 
out live on the X-Factor last week.

He wrote on Twitter: ‘For the 
avoidance of doubt “Call Me Maybe” is the song of 2012.. But (in the 
absence of the fab Misha B) I'm voting for Ella.’

X-Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger was taken aback, and asked: ‘Is he really called Ed Balls?’ before adding: ‘Vote for Balls!’

He then tweeted Scherzinger direct: ‘Hey @NicoleScherzy .. This is Crazy .. Thanks for the shout-out.. Call me maybe.’

‘It certainly enlivened our sitting room’, he jokes, though his children ‘were appalled’.

It is unclear what they make of the fact he seems unable to switch on the TV without breaking down.

The shadow chancellor claims to cry watching Antiques Roadshow when someone learns their heirloom is worth a fortune and earlier this year revealed he first cried watching Disney 1973 film version of Robin Hood

His claim to cry at Modern Family 
comes a year to the day after he gave an interview revealing he blubbed 
at Antiques Roadshow. ‘You know, when someone comes in with some family 
heirloom and it’s often the last bit in the programme and the expert 
says, “Do you know how much this is worth? It’s valued at X thousand 
pounds.”

‘And they say, “I’m amazed it’s worth that much, but it means more to me than money.” Incredibly emotional.’

Children singing in harmony in the Sound of Music is also said to move Mr Balls to tears

The 45-year-old has boasted of his culinary prowess, offering to cook George Osborne  a 14-hour pulled pork South Carolina barbecue

In the same interview with Total 
Politics magazine he admitted to shedding a tear at the scene from the 
Sound of Music ‘when the father brings the Baroness back from 
Vienna...and the children sing the Sound of Music in harmony with the 
guitar’.

Earlier this year he revealed he first cried at a film aged five or six, watching the 1973 Disney version of Robin Hood.

He told The Times of the moment he 
welled-up: ‘There is a point where the rabbits have saved up all year to
give the little rabbit a gold coin for his birthday and then the 
Sheriff of Nottingham comes in and says “I’ve come to collect the 
taxes.” And he takes the gold coin!’Mr Balls has also boasted of his 
efforts to learn how to play the piano – passing the Grade 1 exam 
normally taken by children – and his prowess on the drums.

Earlier this month he revealed he would appear as a guest drummer for folk-rock band Clogiron.

The confessions to weeping are seen in Westminster as an attempt to soften his hard man image

Last year Mr Balls also passionately revealed he was a big fan on One Man And His Dog.

'The relationship between the farmer and his dog, the skill, the countryside, the music – it's a fabulous programme," he told the Independent on Sunday.

'The world divides into those people who like watching One Man and His Dog and those who don't. And I've always liked One Man and His Dog.'

He insisted it was one of the few programmes not to make him cry, but added: 'You see the guy, he's trained his dog, and he's so proud of the dog, and you can just see that relationship. It's about a celebration of relationships; it's a big deal.'
