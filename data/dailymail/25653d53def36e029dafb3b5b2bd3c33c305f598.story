Charlotte Church and her parents settled her phone-hacking damages action for £600,000 at the High Court

Singer Charlotte Church yesterday said she 
was 'sickened and disgusted' by the News of the World's phone hacking which directly led to 33 articles appearing in the newspaper about her and her family. 

The 26-year-old was at London's High Court to accept £600,0000 damages from News Group Newspapers (NGN) which owns the now defunct tabloid.

Lawyers said the stories included an article published about her father having an affair and taking cocaine which they published despite the paper knowing that her mother had just attempted suicide.

The singer said money 'could never mend' the damage that was
done but she planned to put the payout towards protecting herself and her children from further 
invasions of their privacy.

In a statement outside the Royal Courts 
of Justice, Miss Church said: 'What I have discovered as the litigation has gone on has sickened and disgusted me.

'Nothing was deemed off limits by those who pursued me and my family, just to make money for a multinational news corporation.'

She added: 'In my opinion, they are not truly sorry, only sorry they got caught.'

The settlement includes £300,000 in legal costs and a public apology and follows months of legal wrangling.

In November, the Leveson Inquiry heard that Miss Church’s mother tried to 
commit suicide shortly before the News of the World published a story 
about her partner having an affair and taking cocaine.

The front page story ran in December 2005 under the headline 'Church three in a bed cocaine shock'.

Phones
belonging to the Miss Church family were hacked and staff knew about her 
mother’s suicide attempt but published the story anyway, lawyers said.

The newspaper then made a ‘Faustian 
pact’ with the singer's mother that they would not publish lurid
follow-up story about her husband’s affair if she did an exclusive 
interview.

The inquiry also heard Miss Church claim she waived a £100,000 fee to sing at Rupert Murdoch’s wedding to Wendi Deng in 1999 in return for favourable coverage in his newspapers. News International denied an offer was made.

However, the singer said she was betrayed by the media tycoon, whose 
publications she claims have attacked her throughout her career.

In addition, she said her overnight success as the ‘Voice of an Angel’ when she was just 11 had warped her childhood and meant she was hunted by paparazzi for years, with newspapers determined to portray her as a ‘fallen angel’.

Miss Church said yesterday that her parents had suffered as much as she had in their treatment by the company.

'Whatever I have had to go through, they have suffered as well. They 
have been harassed, put under surveillance, and my mother was bullied 
into revealing her own private medical condition for no other reason 
than they were my parents.

'Someone in a newspaper thought that was OK. How can that be, in any right-thinking society?'

She said she was 'happy' with the result in one sense, but added that 
she had discovered that, despite an apology, 'these people were prepared
to go to any lengths to prevent me exposing their behaviour', including
forcing her mother to relive the 'enormous personal distress' she had 
been caused in 2005.

'It seems they have learned nothing, and I would have learned nothing 
more from an actual trial since it was clear that no-one from News 
International was prepared to take the stand to explain their actions,' 
she said.

It comes as it emerged the phone-hacking scandal could deepen and spread to the U.S. after claims Mr Mulcaire had American telephone numbers in his notes.

It
has been claimed he had the numbers of Miss Church’s Los 
Angeles agent and New York publicist among thousands of pages of notes 
seized by Scotland Yard detectives.

News International has declined to comment on the latest allegations.

Miss Church added: 'I would also like to make it clear that we were never in 
this for the money. Money could never mend the damage that was done.

'I intend to dedicate my portion of the settlement to protecting myself and my children from further invasions of our privacy.'

As Rupert Murdoch's news empire is under huge strain again following a barrage of new allegations, the media tycoon took to Twitter to pat himself on the back for his latest venture.

Twenty four hours after the Sun on Sunday hit the streets, replacing the now defunct News of the World, Mr Murdoch tweeted: 'Amazing! The Sun confirmed sale of 3.260,000 copies yesterday. Thanks all readers and advertisers. Sorry if sold out - more next time.'

The bullish tweet came just hours after the triple blow of: Church accepting £600,000 damages over phone hacking; the police chief leading the phone hacking investigation, saying there was a 'culture of illegal payments' at The Sun; and revelations that Rebekah Brooks knew that there were up to 110 victims of phone hacking at the News of the World as far back at 2006.

The Church family solicitor Mike Brookes told Mr Justice Vos that the newspaper had 'repeatedly targeted' Miss Church and her voicemail messages 'and in doing so unlawfully 
obtained her private medical information and details of her personal 
relationships with her family and friends.'

Michael
Silverleaf QC, for NGN, said: 'I am here today to offer my client's 
sincere apologies to the Church family for the way they have been 
treated.

'NGN acknowledges 
that they should never have had to endure what they have suffered and 
that NGN are liable for the damage that they have caused.'

Miss Church
settled a lawsuit against News International on February 23.

Mulcaire was jailed in 2007 for illegally accessing mobile-phone messages.

The phone-hacking scandal has led to a series of large pay-outs, as well as the News of the World’s closure.

In
total, more than 50 phone hacking cases have been settled, with the 
majority of victims receiving between £25,000 and £30,000.

Among the bigger payments, the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler are said to have received £3million.

Such deals mean the £20million fund put aside by News Group Newspapers for settlements may need to be topped up.

More
than 800 victims of phone-hacking have been identified by Scotland Yard
since it launched Operation Weeting, a fresh investigation into the 
practice, last year.
