A Maine judge gave nurse Kaci Hickox the OK to go wherever she pleases, handing state officials a defeat on Friday in their bid to restrict her movements as a precaution against Ebola.

Judge Charles C. LaVerdiere ruled Hickox must continue daily monitoring and cooperate with health officials if she chooses to travel.

The judge said there's no need to restrict her movements because she's not showing symptoms of Ebola. In his ruling, LaVerdiere thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and wrote that 'people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational'.

It was also claimed today, the 33-year-old nurse's roommate in Sierra Leone had been treated for Ebola but the court reportedly said that any risk had passed.

Fox reported the detail on Miss Hickox's roommate following the court ruling. 

According to the affidavit, a CDC official in Maine said: 'The Respondent's roommate in Africa became infected without knowing how she became infected with Ebola.' 

At a press conference outside her home on Friday, Miss Hickox said the information that her roommate had Ebola was inaccurate but did not offer any more details.  

She said: 'I am humbled today by the judge's decision and even more humbled fro the support we have received.

'I know that Ebola is a scary disease. I have seen it face to face and I know that we are nowhere near winning this fight.

She continued: 'To my fellow healthcare workers in West Africa, both national and international staff risking their lives to fight this disease my thoughts, prayers and gratitude remain with you. As a global community we can end Ebola.'

She told reporters that at the moment she had no plans to go into Fort Kent because she did not want to make anyone uncomfortable.

She said: 'I'm going to have Ted make my favorite Japanese meal and watch a scary movie since it is Halloween.' 

Maine Governor Paul LePage disagreed with the judge's decision, but said the state will follow the law.

'As governor, I have done everything I can to protect the health and safety of Mainers. The judge has eased restrictions with this ruling and I believe it is unfortunate. However, the State will abide by law,' LePage said.

The Governor had said on Thursday that he did not want any Maine citizen 'within three feet' of Miss Hickox.  

With the judge's ruling, a state police cruiser parked outside her home drove away.

The state went to court Thursday to impose restrictions on Hickox until the 21-day incubation period for Ebola ends on November 10. Hickox, who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, contended confinement at her home in northern Maine violated her rights.

The judge thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and acknowledged the gravity of restricting someone's constitutional rights without solid science to back it up.

'The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,' he wrote.

'The court is fully aware that people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational.'

Hickox, 33, stepped into the media glare when she returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone to become subject to a mandatory quarantine in New Jersey. 

After being released from a hospital there, she returned to this small town, where she was placed under what Maine authorities called a voluntary quarantine.

She said she is following the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of daily monitoring for fever and other signs of the disease.

'I'm not willing to stand here and let my civil rights be violated when it's not science-based,' she said earlier in the week.

In a court filing, the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention backed away from the state's original request for an in-home quarantine and called for restrictions that fall in line with federal guidelines.

Hickox remains at risk of being infected with Ebola until the end of a 21-day incubation period, Dr. Sheila Pinette.

'It is my opinion that the respondent should be subjected to an appropriate public health order for mandatory direct active monitoring and restrictions on movement as soon as possible and until the end of the incubation period ... to protect the public health and safety,' she wrote.
