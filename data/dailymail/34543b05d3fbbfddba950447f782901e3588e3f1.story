A letter penned by Horatio Nelson using his right hand months before he lost the arm in battle is due to go up for auction

A letter penned by Lord Horatio Nelson using his right hand months before he lost the arm during a battle is set to go up for sale.

The note, which is dated August 16 1795, was addressed from the then-Captain to a diplomat in Genoa, Italy, named Francis Drake.

In the note, Nelson boasts about the size of his squadron after being promoted to the rank of Commodore earlier in the year.

He also explains his frustration about being kept 'completely in the dark' by the army about their movements on the continent.

The correspondence, which is expected to sell for £10,000 when it goes up for auction, is a rare example of Nelson's handwriting before he lost his right arm following the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in 1797.

In 1795 Nelson was serving as a Post-Captain on board HMS Agamemnon in the fleet of Admiral Hotham, disrupting French convoys in the Mediterranean.

On March 13 and 14, during the Battle of Genoa, Nelson distinguished himself after taking on the French vessel Ca Ira.

Despite being massively outmanned and outgunned by the larger ship, Nelson managed to inflict significant damage, which later led to the Ca Ira's capture by British forces.

Later the same year Nelson was promoted to Commodore following the Battle of Hyeres Islands on July 13 when he was one of only a few British ships to engage Rear Admiral Pierre Martin's French fleet, causing one of the vessels to burst into flames and explode.

Dated August 16 1795, the letter is from Nelson - writing with his right hand - to Francis Drake, a diplomat in the Italian city of Genoa

Nelson had just been promoted to Commodore before the letter was written, and in it he boasts of the size of his squadron, saying it 'may never be this large again'

In the letter, which is dated August 16, a 37-year-old Nelson can be seen flexing his muscles after his recent promotion.  

In the note, Lord Nelson expresses his disappointment that Francis Drake will not meet Admiral Hotham until he returns from Leghorn.

At the time Nelson was under the command of Admiral Hotham. In the letter he laments the fact that Drake will not get to meet his commander

Lord Nelson said: 'I went off a great distance and wrote to the Admiral but his resolution to go first to Leghorn was so fixed that nothing could turn him.

'His despatches from the Admiralty are of such a nature as require him to head his fleet together for constant readiness for service.

'Perhaps you will still come here with what I can do with my present squadron, which may never be so large again, you can rest assured will be done. Ever your most faithful Horatio Nelson.

'If you could, without great inconvenience, come for a day to Vado I should like to know from you, the exact plans which the army is to follow, at present I am completely in the dark.'

The provenance of the letter is confirmed by a note on the reverse of the paper that it was given to a descendant of Admiral Drake in September 1868.

The letter, which was found in a house near Derby, is estimated to fetch between £8,000 and £10,000 when it is sold at Hansons Auction House on September 27.

Charles Hanson from the auctioneers said: 'We are pleased to offer such an important part of our maritime history.

'The letter highlights even our greatest maritime war hero was often “in the dark” as to the movements the army were to follow.

'We always perceive Nelson to be at the helm of every battle and conflict and clearly in this letter he was somewhat concerned.' 

In 1795 Nelson was serving in the fleet of Admiral Hotham in the Mediterranean, on board his favourite ship the HMS Agamemnon. 

While Nelson, who was 37 at the time, started the year as a Post-Captain he was promoted to Commodore by the end of July after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Genoa, and than again at the Battle of Hyeres Islands.

The letter, dated August 16, shows Nelson flexing his muscles in his new command.

Writing to Francis Drake - a diplomat in Genoa, not the famous explorer - he boasts of the size of his squadron which 'may never be so large again.'

He also laments the fact that Drake will not get to meet Hotham as he the commander been asked to depart for Leghorn, otherwise known as the Italian port city of Livorno.

And, showing that Nelson has not yet reached the peak of his career, he also asks Drake for information on what the army is doing on shore, confessing that he is 'completely in the dark' about their movements.

Nelson penned the letter in his right hand, two years before it was removed after he was wounded at the battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in 1797
