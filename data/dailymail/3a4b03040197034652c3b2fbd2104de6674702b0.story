American fans saw the cruel side of the beautiful game on Sunday night when the U.S. team lost at the death to Portugal - but the World Cup dream is not over yet.

Team USA were 2-1 up during a sweltering game in Manaus on Sunday night before Portugal's Silvestre Varela's goal in the last 30 seconds of stoppage time denied them entry to the final 16.

Only two teams will survive from Group G, known as the 'group of death', out of the U.S., Portugal, Germany and Ghana.

The United States now has four points in Group G, the same as Germany. They face each other in Recife on Thursday while Portugal face Ghana on the same day in Brasilia.

The top two teams will go forward to the next stage. Both Ghana and Portugal lag behind with one point each.

Winning a World Cup game results in three points while a draw is one point. Team USA will enter the next round with the following results.

If the U.S. win or draw against Germany, they will enter the final 16.

A win against Germany places the U.S. at the top of the group meaning they will place the second placed team from group H (Belgium, Algeria, Russia and South Korea). 

If the U.S. and Germany draw, then the 
latter takes top position in the group. The result of the Portugal vs 
Ghana game has nothing to do with it.

If Germany wins, team USA will go 
through in second place - unless Ghana or Portugal wins and then it 
comes down to goal difference. 

Portugal must beat Ghana to have a chance of progressing.

In
 goal difference, the U.S. is one up, Ghana in one down and Portugal is 
minus four. If the U.S. loses, then the result they want is a Portugal 
win, as they are less likely to make up the goal difference.

If the U.S. loses on Thursday and Ghana wins, the latter will qualify if either game is won by two clear goals.

For example, if the U.S. loses 1-0, then Ghana would need to win 2-1 to go through on goal difference.

It is a nail-biting wait for U.S. fans who were seconds from watching their team walk off with their first come-from-behind win at a World Cup.

Seconds from glory: Portugal's forward Silvestre Varela heads the ball into the back of the net past U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard in the dying seconds of Sunday's Group G match between USA and Portugal at the Amazonia Arena in Manaus

'Football's cruel sometimes,' said Tim Howard, a former teammate of Cristiano Ronaldo, who set up the final goal that got past him when Varela headed the ball in.

Nani had scored first 
for Portugal, shooting past a sprawling Tim Howard in the fifth minute, 
but the Americans responded in the second half as Portugal seemed to 
wilt in the stifling heat.

But Jermaine Jones' exquisite 28-yard 
shot tucked inside the far post in the 64th minute and Dempsey's goal 
off his stomach in the 86th put the Americans ahead 2-1.

Clint Dempsey, playing with a broken 
nose, then put the Americans ahead in the 81st. The United States 
captain used his stomach to direct the ball into the net from a cross by
 Zusi.

The last-second draw denied the Americans a spot in the second round, but it kept Portugal alive in the tournament.

'It was a thriller,' said U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann. 'Everybody who had a chance to be today in Manaus will talk about this game for a long time.
