We did try to warn you. On Friday here at MailOnline Sport, Phil Duncan spelled out the kind of sporting challenge 15 Brownlee brothers couldn’t manage. Yet in delivering his ‘Definitive Armchair Guide to 24 Hours of Sporting Heaven’, he was only scratching the surface.

From where I was sitting, the weekend actually started on Friday evening on BBC2. The Corporation had live football back on the station. Last time we saw that, it was Gary Lineker and Co high above Copacabana Beach for the World Cup. 

Friday night, it was Dan Walker and his team, their loafers sinking gently into the soggy grass, as they got up close and personal with the FA Cup at a first-round visit by Exeter City to non-League Warrington.

And clearly the plan was to get the telly audience right inside the game because the pitch was very much their set. Walker covered more turf than your average Premier League midfielder in his quest for chats and sights that would illustrate that Cup ‘magic’.

Robbie Savage, all dolled up, was also out there to interview Exeter’s dapper boss Paul Tisdale, who he described as ‘the second best dressed man in the ground’. I can only assume Robbie had seen Bryan Ferry in the crowd, then?

But star of the BBC show was without doubt Warrington Town boss Shaun Reid. The younger brother of Peter, he is blessed with the kind of craggy countenance that looks like it might have been formed on a lathe. 

Those features were under constant surveillance throughout the game, in various states of anxiety. But at the end - with the presenters and crowd now massed on the pitch like an al fresco version of Top Gear - he was all smile when he proclaimed after Warrington’s famous win, ‘No-one will want to come here, pal, I tell ya’. I for one didn’t doubt him.

As pundit Trevor Sinclair reminded us at the end of that game on Friday,

New Zealand came out 24-21 winners at Twickenham against England in the first Autumn international

Warrington is a rugby league town. Come early Saturday morning, that particular sport was actually taking place half a world away in New Zealand, where England’s Four Nations future was on the line.

It was a game that didn’t exactly ease us gently into a packed weekend of action. Described variously on commentary as ‘exquisite’ and ‘end-to-end basketball’, what these untrained eyes saw was a blistering clash that went right to the wire. It was at times breathless stuff, leaving England so near, yet so far - and me needing a bit of a lie down before the next event.

That took place over at BT Sport where Jake Humphrey’s version of the ‘Walker walk’ was conducted inside the more familiar surroundings of Anfield before the start of the lunchtime game.

His stroll started outside the visiting team’s dressing room where Jose Mourinho, a flamboyant scarf defying gravity around his shoulders, was on hand to explain it wouldn’t be him giving the team talk behind that dressing room door.

‘Not me. Matic. I finished my work with them in the hotel’, said Jose. Paul Scholes was lost for words pitchside at the prospect of making a dressing room speech. Back in the day it was clearly the fella’s size sevens that did all the talking.

Saturday afternoon was also to provide the emotional barometer on what was of course a weekend that was about so much more than sport.

Rugby union’s home Twickenham was the backdrop for the second clash of the day between England and New Zealand. And a viscerally vivid visit to the home team’s dressing room captured the tension that was already in the air.

From the studio, Jonny Wilkinson talked about it being a ‘stressful time’ as we saw a group of tight-lipped rugby players trying to get their act together.

Some read match programmes, others wet dry mouths with bottles of water, while a couple just stared into the distance.

However, it was a different set of emotions that were drawn upon elsewhere in the build-up. Sky Sports did a sterling job of commemorating the centenary of the Great War. In particular by taking England captain Chris Robshaw to visit the grave of his counterpart from 100 years ago, who lost his life on the battlefield in May 1915.

This then became more immediately real as the camera looked into the tearful eyes of Lance Corporal Semesa Rokoduguni, in line for the national anthem wearing his first England shirt. This particular playing field in England certainly felt like the perfect place for two sets of sporting warriors to also be representing a united front of remembrance.

On to Sunday lunchtime then, and the yes/no debate was now clearly over. ‘Even the marketing guys didn’t think he’d make it’ Sue Barker told us on BBC2 as she stood below the Andy Murray-bereft banner advertising the ATP World Tour Finals from the O2 Arena.

Having had a big World Cup and plenty of athletics, Auntie will have been delighted with their long weekend’s work. What with their involvement in the rugby, and Sunday also being wallpapered with their on-going FA Cup coverage, they are steadily reaffirming themselves as a competitive sport broadcaster. Of which, much of Great Britain would surely approve?

On Sunday though, the big question was would nearly 20,000 of them be welcoming Murray with open arms?

‘London town. His town. Where Andy Murray made history’ is how Sue sold it up. And as the proud Scot made his way through the smoke in The Smoke, and on to the court, it was clear it was the return of a favourite son.

This location provides a fabulously atmospheric setting for watching tennis on the box. An arena that can be dressed dramatically, and exude a sense of the atmosphere inside it. However, with this first game of the week, there may have been smoke, but there wasn’t much fire from Murray, as he lost in straight sets.

Nico Rosberg set up a nail-biting final weekend of F1 action with his win in Brazil on Sunday

Which of course was disappointing, but did mean that with a deft flick of the remote control, it was straight over to Sky Sports F1 channel just in time to watch Lewis Hamilton launch himself from the grid in Brazil, and possibly on towards the title.

And for a moment there, as the laps hit the mid-fifties, it felt like that title might be nailed on. Especially if you got caught up in the fizzing commentary of David Croft and Martin Brundle, who were going through the gears as Hamilton edged ever closer to Rosberg’s Mercedes.

But in the end the difference between Hamilton finishing first and second was sealed back on lap 29. In the best piece of filmed action of the weekend, we were right there inside Lewis’ car as he spun off, stopped, then dragged himself straight back into the action. Exhilarating stuff!

Yet this weekend was still not over. Off now to Wembley and Channel 4’s coverage of the NFL, where they were showing London’s latest live regular season game.

The channel’s remit with this sport is to welcome in as many of the casual and the curious as possible. So it looked a very smart move indeed when they threw a couple of well-known speed merchants at their coverage.

Iwan Thomas was enlisted to report from the touchline and help track down a few familiar faces. And I was a little surprised not to see a disgruntled Roy Hodgson among them, clutching a gardening fork and bucket of sand.

While in the studio up in the stands, The American Football Show highlights programme co-hosts Nat Coombs and Vernon Kay were joined by the man whose punditry work in athletics is, much like his running had been, pure gold.

Michael Johnson may have been there as a ‘superfan’ but he really knew his stuff. Add in that voice and sheer presence, and it’s more convincing than Obi-Wan Kenobi telling us, ‘These are not the droids you’re looking for’.

Indeed, he even knew Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, ‘Was not that passionate about football. He loves golf’’. And that he would be ‘key to the offense’. Even with a dodgy back, and in just three quarters of the game, he was indeed, just that.

So the Cowboys brought my jam-packed long weekend of settee-hugging sport on the telly to an end with a victory over the Jaguars.

Three days that were not so much a sprint, more a triathlon.
