An insider trading investigation has been launched into Ted Kennedy Jr's former company.

The Marwood Group, a healthcare-focused consulting firm co-founded by Kennedy, received notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week.

The agency's staff officially notified Marwood that it plans to recommend to the full commission charging the company with civil insider trading.

Ted Kennedy Jr was elected to the Connecticut state Senate in November, having left The Marwood Group in January to seek political office

Kennedy said the company is cooperating fully with SEC investigation into the allegations.

The investigation has focused on alleged government information passed on to Marwood clients in 2010 about a new prostate-cancer treatment developed by the company Dendreon.

'I understand the SEC's concerns about the flow of government information, especially given the public's desire for more transparency,' Kennedy said in a statement.

'While I have never been named or questioned by the SEC, I understand that my former company, the Marwood Group, has cooperated fully with the SEC's requests over the last three and a half years.'

Kennedy, the 53-year-old son of the late Senator Ted Kennedy, was elected in November to Connecticut's legislature. He is the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy.

He served as president of Marwood for 12 years before leaving in January. He announced his candidacy for the state senate in April, and takes office in January.

Marwood spokesman Michael McKeon denied any insider trading and said the company has been surprised by the allegations.

'We are very surprised because if you look at the facts there is no tipper, no materiality and clearly no financial benefit for anyone. In fact the whole premise is absurd,' McKeon said.

Marwood has offices in New York, Washington, DC, and London. 

An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the investigation.

Should formal charges be filed, it could be the first case in which regulators treat political intelligence, non-public information from a government source, in the same way as illegal insider information, expanding the current definition of what constitutes an illegal trade.
