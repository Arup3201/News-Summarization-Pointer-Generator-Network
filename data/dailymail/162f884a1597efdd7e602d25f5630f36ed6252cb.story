Being a first time parent can be difficult, especially when trying to get to grips with a baby’s sleeping habits or behaviour.

So with that in mind a device called the Sproutling Baby Monitor is set to be released.

Using an anklet that attaches to a baby’s leg in tandem with an app, the device helps parents ensure their baby’s well-being by monitoring their movement, sound levels and more.

A California-based company has released an ankle bracelet for babies (shown). Called Sproutling Baby Monitor it alerts parents to their child's well-being

The Sproutling Baby Monitor is comprised of three parts: a wearable band, a smart charger, and a mobile app.

A waterproof wristband that tells people when they've been in the sun too long could help combat soaring skin cancer cases.

The band changes colour from yellow to pink on UV exposure, warning people when to seek the shade before getting burnt.

At £1 ($1.7) each, Scottish scientists developed it as a cheaper, more effective way of reducing rates of skin cancer.

The wristband's sensitivity to ultraviolet light means it can alert the wearer to the danger before it is visible on the skin.

The Smartsun monitor works through a significant colour change, created by an acid-release agent which detects ultraviolet light and a dye responding to pH levels in the indicator. 

Professor Andrew Mills and Dr Michael McFarlane developed the original invention while they were with Strathclyde University's Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry. 

The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California and the device will retail for £177 ($299) when it goes on sale at the end of 2015, although it is only available for pre-order now.

The monitor gathers 16 different measurements every second to help parents understand things about their baby.

The anklet syncs with an app to provide data to the parents, and multiple phones can be connected at once.

For example the device can monitor the baby’s heart rate or detect when it is likely to wake up based on how restless it is.

It can even determine what mood the baby is in when it wakes up, or if the room is too bright or hot for the baby to sleep comfortably.

And if parents are watching TV in another room, the app will let them know if the volume is too loud and might disturb the baby.

The device can tell parents if their child is too hot, restless or when they will wake up. The product is waterproof (straps shown in centre) and can be recharged wirelessly in a charging bowl (top right)

‘Parents have been relying on baby monitors for over 75 years and in that time, they fundamentally haven’t changed at all,’ said Sproutling co-founder Chris Bruce.

‘They continue to be a poor extension of parents’ eyes and ears and require constant attention to see if your baby is moving or making noise.

‘As parents ourselves, we wanted something that could tell us how our baby was doing when they weren’t moving or making noise and when we were unable to pay full attention, like when showering or sleeping.

‘We created the Sproutling Baby Monitor to be smarter and help parents be more effective - and we really hope our product will instill confidence in parents so they can grow happy families.’

The product was invented by a team of new parents and former engineers at Apple and Google, along with the help of child pediatric specialists and PhD scientists

The band is made from medical-grade, hypoallergenic silicone that is manufactured without chemicals or toxins.

It’s also washing machine safe with a removable sensor.

It can be wirelessly charged by dropping it into a supplied charging bowl, which doubles in utility as it also acts as the environmental sensor for the room.

The app can even be shared with caregivers, like grandparents or the babysitter, so parents can keep an eye on things even when they aren’t at home.
