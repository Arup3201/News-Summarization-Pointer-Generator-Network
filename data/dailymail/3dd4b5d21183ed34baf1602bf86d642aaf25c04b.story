Pressures of the industry: Russian supermodel Anne V, 27, has spoken out at a Model Alliance convention about the challenges she faced as a teen model

Supermodel Anne V has opened up about the challenges she faced as a teen model dealing with the pressures of the industry.

The 27-year-old beauty was speaking at a Model Alliance information session, during which she talked about moving from a small Russian village to New York City at the age of 15 to pursue a modelling career.

She said the pressures of being thin took a toll, especially at such a young age.

'Being told to lose weight at 16 was so tough for me,' she admitted to Fashionista, adding: 'No child should ever experience that.'

The supermodel also spoke about 'being 16 and never been kissed' to suddenly getting attention from men, adding that she was often offered alcohol and access to clubs.

Anne V - whose full surname is Vyalitsyna - was one of the speakers at the convention, which was aimed at addressing a new legislation that will require existing child labor laws to apply to models under 18.

The legislation, which could provide underage models with chaperones, tutors and trust accounts, is currently awaiting New York City Governor Andrew Cuomo's signature.

The meeting was an open discussion for models and their parents to learn about the terms of the new legislation, and how it will change the industry.

Sara Ziff, founder of Model Alliance, said the new law is 'long overdue'.

Indeed, Anne V explained that many of the models she had met in her career found the long, unregulated hours and lack of legal protections too much of a strain.

'There are so many girls that I 
started out with, that I lived with and was friends with, that I have no
idea where they are now,' she said.

Anne V has had a long and successful 
run as a model, having walked the runway for Victoria's Secret, Chanel 
and Prada, and appeared on the covers of Elle, Glamour and Vogue.

But the supermodel - who dated Maroon
5's Adam Levine last year and is currently linked to New York Mets 
pitcher Matt Harvey - said the job definitely comes with its challenges.

'You need to have a voice,' she said at the event, 'because you're not going to last in this business just being stupid.'

She also told Modelinia that she hopes 
with her previous experience as a teen model, she can support other young girls who find
themselves in similar situations.

'Looking back and going over many of the struggles I faced, I wish 
there were laws protecting minors,' she said.

'And an organization of older, more 
experienced models, that could have supported me and looked out for my 
best interest.'
