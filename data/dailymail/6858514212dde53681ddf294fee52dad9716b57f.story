Television viewers have become more tolerant of violence and swearing, the head of Ofcom has claimed.

But the sexist or racist language of the 1970s is far less acceptable than it once was, research by the broadcasting regulator reveals.

Ofcom’s chief executive Ed Richards, who is about to stand down after 11 years in the job, told MPs there has been a big change in tolerance levels in the past few decades.

Ofcom chief says the British public has grown more tolerant - but still does not like discriminatory language on TV shows. Till Death Us Do Part, which frequently had lead character Alf Garnett making racist remarks

But critics argued the British public has simply become ‘desensitised’ to swearing after years of lax regulation by Ofcom.

According to the regulator’s latest research, published in July, only 35 per cent of viewers think there is too much violence on TV, down from 55 per cent in 2008.

Just 35 per cent think there is too much swearing, down from 53 per cent six years ago, while 26 per cent believe there is too much sex, a slight rise from 25 per cent.

‘There has been a big change in this over the years,’ Mr Richards told the Commons culture, media and sport committee.

‘People are more tolerant of a degree of violence than they were. They are much more tolerant of certain forms of swearing than they were.

‘There are still some words – very few to be honest – but still some words which are off limits or only in certain circumstances.

‘They are much less tolerant, interestingly enough, of language which is regarded as discriminatory or unfair or unjust towards people. That’s a big change if you think of the Seventies and some of the programmes which went out then. The public just do not want to see that any more.’

TV shows such as Till Death Us Do Part, which ran from 1965 to 1975, had lead character Alf Garnett frequently making racist remarks.

A string of shows – such as The Thick Of It (pictured) – have been accused of needlessly turning the airwaves blue, leaning to accusations that the public is 'desensitised' to swearing 

In recent years a number of TV comedians have come under fire for littering their routines with swear words.

And a string of shows – such as The Thick Of It and Mrs Brown’s Boys – have been accused of needlessly turning the airwaves blue. Vivienne Pattison, the director of campaign group Mediawatch-UK, said that if it was true that viewers were less concerned by bad language it was simply because they had become ‘desensitised’ to it.

Mediawatch-UK recently conducted a similar survey in which more than 2,000 viewers were asked whether they had seen inappropriate material broadcast before the 9pm watershed.

Miss Pattison said all of those surveyed said they had, but only 26 per cent had complained about it.

She said: ‘It is not true to say that people are more tolerant about bad language, sex or violence on screen. What has happened is that they have now lost faith in the ability of Ofcom to do anything about it so they have stopped even complaining.’

One of the MPs who quizzed Mr Richards, former Labour Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw, said he felt UK broadcasters are now too intolerant of nudity while being willing to accept violence and sex on screen.

However, Mr Richards denied that British television has become more ‘prudish’ about nudity and was ‘importing American values and morality’.
