With a little help from their mother, two six-month-old polar bear cubs played with wooden crates and splashed around as they were let loose on their new swimming pool. 

Twins Nobby and Nela were given free reign at their new enclosure at the Hellabrunn zoo in Munich, southern Germany. 

The mischievous pair chased each other, and their mother Giovanna, around the pool, and were spotted play-fighting.

But, at times, they slowed down to sniff out their new surroundings.

The cubs were born in the zoo of Munich in December 2013 and have been inseparable ever since.

They were named to keep in line with a rule that all animals born at the zoo must be given names beginning with the letter 'n'.
