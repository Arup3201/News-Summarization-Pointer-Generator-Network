Suicidal: Christian Alberto Sierra was shot and killed by police after lunging at them with a knife

A suicidal teenager has been killed by police after allegedly threatening an officer with a knife.

Christian Alberto Sierra started threatening to kill himself on Saturday afternoon and an unidentified female friend called police for help.

Christian, 17, was at a friend's house in his hometown of Purcellville, Virginia when police responded to the emergency call and found him.

Fox 5 reports that he lunged at police with a knife when they approached him, prompting them to shoot him.

One
 of Christian's friends wrote about the incident on Facebook just hours 
after it happened and said that he heard the multiple gunshots.

Peter
 Bludov said that Christian had cut himself with a knife by the time the
 police got to the house but he had not killed himself.

'He
 was my friend! He was suicidal... but he failed to kill himself. 
Someone tried to stop his bleeding and refused,' Bludov wrote on 
Facebook.

'And there you 
see a kid running through a neighborhood with a knive [sic] and had 
blood all over him. That’s where the cop shot him 5 times. I heard the 
gunshots.'

He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was late declared dead.

An unidentified woman claiming to be one of Christian's relatives told WJLA that his family believes the situation should have been handled differently.
