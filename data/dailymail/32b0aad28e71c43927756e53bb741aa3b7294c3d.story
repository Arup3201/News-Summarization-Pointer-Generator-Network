MPs will question Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe next month over the investigation into missing teenager Alice Gross

MPs are set to haul Britain's top police officer and prosecutor to the Commons over the investigation into missing teenager Alice Gross.

Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe and the Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders will be questioned amid growing anger over foreign criminals living freely in Britain.

It comes after it emerged the on-the-run chief suspect in the 14-year-old's disappearance is a convicted killer from Latvia.

Arnis Zalkans, 41, went missing a week after Alice vanished while walking close to the Grand Union Canal near her home in west London on August 28. CCTV shows Mr Zalkalns riding a bicycle 15 minutes later past the same spot.

Mr Zalkalns was jailed in 1998 for his wife's murder. He served seven years before moving to the UK. He was allowed to stay in the country despite being investigated in 2009 over an alleged indecent assault on a 14 year-old in Ealing, west London.

Home Affairs Select Committee chair Keith Vaz said it was 'absurd' that officers had not issued a European Arrest Warrant for Mr Zalkalns and vowed to get answers from Britain's most senior policeman and prosecutor once Parliament returned next month.

Mr Vaz said: 'It's absurd. A European Arrest Warrant should have been applied for.

'At the very least they could have gone before a judge, who may have granted them one.

'We will be seeking answers.'

Mr Vaz, speaking to the Sun, said it was 'incredible' that the family of Cancer sufferer Ashya King were tracked down with an arrest warrant - but not in this case.

He told the newspaper: 'We need to know whether the problem is with the Warrants or with the Criminal Justice System.'

UKIP leader Nigel Farage has attacked EU freedom of movement rules which stop the Government refusing entry to convicted criminals.

He said: 'Convicted Latvian murderer is suspect in disappearance of Alice Gross. EU rules mean we can't stop people like this entering the country.'

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg this morning said the problem was actually EU countries not sharing enough information about criminals crossing borders, risking a furious response from Tory MPs.

He called on countries in the European Union to share 'much, much more information' about serious convicted criminals with each other.

In his Call Clegg show on LBC this morning, the Lib Dem leader said: 'Nothing has been proved, but the finger of suspicion is pointing very clearly at this Latvian individual. Why did we not know that he had this conviction?

'Where somebody has been convicted of a crime elsewhere in the European Union we need to provide much, much more information.'

He added: 'The countries in the EU don't send much more information to each other about individuals who have a serious, criminal record. That can easily be fixed,' he said.

'You can create databases and decide which crime you have on that database. You can protect the freedom to move while also protecting our safety by knowing who has a crime against their name so that people can be checked as they move across the European Union.'

But a month after Alice's disappearance, senior detectives have admitted they still have no idea if the chief suspect remains in the UK or if he has fled overseas.

Commander Graham McNulty of Scotland Yard has admitted that even if he was located in Latvia, they are powerless to arrest or even question him, because at this stage they lack the evidence to apply for a European Arrest Warrant.

Police who searched the west London home he shared with his girlfriend and child, found his passport and said he has not used his phone or accessed money from his bank account.

But there are increasing fears that he may have slipped out of the UK and returned to Latvia where he could be being sheltered by members of the criminal fraternity he met while in prison.

It comes as the desperate family of the missing teenager spoke of their 'agony' over her disappearance as police staged a reconstruction of her last known steps on the day she went missing.

Worried father Jose Gross, 60, mother Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, and sister Nina, 19, pleaded with Alice to return home, and spoke of how they longed to hear the musical teenager sing again and see her smile.

'Alice has been missing for four weeks now,' the family said in a statement.

'We are desperately concerned about her welfare and worry constantly about what may have happened to her.

'We are appealing to Alice. If you are out there, to come home where you belong. We love you and we miss you. We want to see your smile again, we want to hear you sing again, to see you cuddle Peggy, or sit at the piano. We want to be a family again.'
