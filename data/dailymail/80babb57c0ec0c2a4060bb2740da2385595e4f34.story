A Florida grandmother is campaigning for clearer custody rights after the prime suspect in her daughter's disappearance currently has complete control of her grandchildren.

The missing woman, Michelle Parker, appeared on The People's Court in November 2011 in a dispute with her ex-fiance Dale Smith. On the same day the show was aired Parker disappeared without trace.

Police have since made Smith the main suspect in this case but he maintains control of the children. Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, is now challenging this.

Volatile: Michelle Parker and Dale Smith had a stormy relationship

Challenge: Yvonne Stewart is pushing to change custody rights in Florida. The prime suspect is the disappearance of her daughter is currently in control of her grandchildren

'Grandparents need to be heard by a judge. We need the right to go to a
court and ask a judge to hear our case, so he can decide if I'll be 
able to visit my grandchildren,' Stewart told Fox Orlando.

'I don't have the right 
to petition. That's what we want. We just want the right to be heard.'

Stewart has revealed that Parker and her two young children lived with her before Michelle disappeared.

The grandparents have written agreement 
with Smith for the custody of the children but Stewart wants clearer 
rights established and legal right to petition the court for visitation.

Dispute: Michelle Parker appeared on The People's Court to dispute an engagement ring with ex-fiance Dale Smith. The program aired the same day she disappeared

While the grandparents' rights are enshrined in some states, they have very little legal power in the state of Florida.

Stewart launched a campaign and petition that grants visitation rights to grandparents when a child's parent goes missing or is murdered.

Florida House representative Darryl Rouson has filed a bill in Tallahasse that will now go through the legislative process.

Smith, who appeared with Parker on The People's Court show, remains the primary suspect in her unsolved disappearance.

Orlando Police Chief Paul Rooney made the announcement in a news conference in which Stewart made an emotional plea to Smith.

Mrs Stewart said: 'You could have avoided this Dale, if you had cooperated with the police and took a polygraph test when they asked you, you could have avoided a lot of stress.

'So unfortunately, you brought this on yourself. We're not going to stop until we find out who did this.'

Mr Rooney said Smith 'simply refused' to take a polygraph test when it was offered to him, ABC News reported.

'Rocky': The couple's relationship was described as 'tense' by friends

Mrs Stewart added: 'Dale, honestly, if you're out there, honey, and you're listening to me, I have always said from day one - it's okay if couples fight.

'If you made a mistake, it was just a second of, "Oh, I lost my head," or whatever and you didn't know what to do ... our family needs to have Michelle home. We need to heal.'

Miss Parker's sister also sent a message to Smith, saying: 'Help us. Help those kids. It's the mother of those kids. You loved her at one point.'

Miss Parker disappeared on November 17, the same day the couple's appearance on The People's Court was aired.

The 33-year-old had twins and a very stormy relationship with Smith. She was last seen dropping off the twins at Smith's house.

Police conducted an night-time raid on Smith's father's home during investigations but would not comment on the findings of the search or and what sparked the raid.

Miss Parker's friend Angela Launer told ABCNews.com:

'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself.'

Miss Launer, 34, said the relationship was 'rocky' and 'tense.'

She said: 'He hurt my best friend. I didn't like him because he made her cry. No one should ever be treated that way.'

Miss Parker applied for a restraining order from Smith in 2009, but was denied one for lack of evidence.

It has also been revealed that Smith was dishonorably discharged from the Marines in 2003 after several court martials, including military convictions for drug possession and domestic battery.

On the TV show Miss Parker and Smith argued over whether Parker had to pay for a $5,000 engagement ring she tossed away during one of their arguments. The judge ruled the two should split the cost.

Miss Parker's family began to realize something was wrong when her 11-year-old son let the family know that he was home from school and his mother was not there.

Miss Launer said: 'She would never have taken off, done that to her brother, sister or mother ... that's why we're crying every day.'
