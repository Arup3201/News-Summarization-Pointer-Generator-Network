An unlikely alliance of left-leaning human rights activists, right-wing conservatives and church leaders has been forged to try and save the life of a mentally ill convicted killer slated for execution this week. 

Attorneys representing Scott Panetti asked the US Supreme Court Monday to halt his lethal injection scheduled for Wednesday saying he is too delusional for execution.

Panetti, 56, is set to be put to death for the 1992 shooting deaths of his estranged wife's parents at their home in Fredericksburg in the Texas Hill Country.

Condemnded: Texas death row inmate Scott Panetti's execution is set for December 3 but his attorneys want the death date withdrawn or at least delayed to allow for a new round of psychological testing to determine if he's competent to be executed

There was 'no doubt' Panetti was severely mentally ill 'before, during and after the crime for which he has been sentenced to death,' attorneys Gregory Wiercioch and Kathryn Kase told the justices. 

'And Mr. Panetti's mental state has further deteriorated since his last evaluation in 2007.'

The long list of those who are opposed to Mr Panetti's execution includes more than 50 Evangelical Christian leaders, seven Methodist bishops, 10 Texas state lawmakers and former libertarian presidential candidate and Republican Congressman Ron Paul, reported The Independent. 

Last month, Paul wrote a letter to Texas Governor Rick Perry asking him to grant Panetti clemency.

Perry's gubernatorial predecessor Mark White, a Democrat, has gone on record calling Panetti's capital murder trial a 'sham.'

Nearly 100,000 people from all walks of life have signed an online petition on Change.org asking to spare Panetti's life.

Even his ex-wife, Sonja, whose parents the inmate shot dead in front of her in 1992, has declared that she believes he is too mentally ill to be put to death.

Scott Panetti's case has something for everyone: libertarians oppose the death penalty because they do not trust the government; fiscal conservatives believe that executing an inmate costs more than imprisoning him for life, and religious conservatives reject capital punishment as a pro-life matter.

Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood abortion clinic staffer-turned anti-abortion activist, wrote in a recent Dallas Morning News op-ed that opposing Panetti's execution is consistent with the key principles of the pro-life movement.

'A fundamental tenet of the pro-life ethic is that all life has value and we are called to protect it, especially in its most vulnerable forms. A culture of life recognizes the value of those who are vulnerable and prioritizes safeguarding them,' she wrote.

Horrific crime: Panetti, at right on a horse with his wife and child, murdered his in-laws as his wife and daughter were splattered with their blood in 1992

Panetti, a Hayward, Wisconsin, native, was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1978 and had been hospitalized more than a dozen times for treatment in the decade before killing Joe and Amanda Alvarado.

Attorneys said the double homicide was the result of a 'psychotic break' Panetti had suffered.

His wife was living with her parents and a week earlier had obtained a court order to keep Panetti away.

His wife and 3-year-old daughter, were sprayed with blood when Panetti shot his in-laws.

They were held hostage until he surrendered after a lengthy standoff with police. He blamed it all on 'Sarge,' one of his multiple personalities. 

Justices in 2002 prohibited the execution of people who are mentally impaired, deciding it violated the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. 

But they have allowed capital punishment for mentally ill prisoners as long as the inmate has a factual and rational understanding of why he's being put to death.

The 'rational understanding' provision was added by the Supreme Court in a 2007 ruling on an appeal from Panetti. 

Records indicate his case has gone to the Supreme Court at least five times since his 1995 conviction and sentence.

Too sick to die: Panetti's lawyers say he is too severely mentally ill to be executed 

'Imposition of the death penalty on people with severe mental illness, as with people with intellectual disability, does not serve the two goals of deterrence and retribution because of their reduced moral culpability,' Panetti's lawyers argued to the high court Monday.

Another appeal for Panetti pending before a federal appeals court seeks an execution delay for additional competency evaluations.

While his medical records contain indications of mental illness, they 'strongly indicate rational awareness of his impending execution and the reason for it,' Ellen Stewart-Klein, an assistant Texas attorney general, told the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

'Panetti's mental status has at best been severely exaggerated by his counsel,' she said.

Also Monday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles refused a petition from Panetti's lawyers to delay his execution for 180 days or recommend to Republican Governor Rick Perry that Panetti's death sentence be commuted to life, board spokesman Raymond Estrada said.

At his trial, Panetti 'wore the garish costume of a dime-store cowboy as he represented himself' and 'engaged in bizarre, incoherent and frightening behavior,' his attorneys said.

His trial judge ruled he could be his own lawyer and appointed a standby attorney whom Panetti never consulted except to call as a witness during the trial's punishment phase.

Bible thumping: Panetti already had a history of mental problems before the shooting, recording 14 hospital stays over 11 years. He's seen here with his brother

Delusional? Attorneys contend Panetti is so delusional that he can't understand why he was convicted and condemned. Here, he's pictured with his mother and father

At one point, the defendant even tried to subpoena Jesus Christ and assassinated President John F. Kennedy as witnesses. He insisted only an insane person could prove insanity.

I just wanted to see my wife,' Panetti, in a taped statement played at his capital murder trial, explained why he went to the home armed with a rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and three knives and dressed in camouflage clothing.

'I put on my combat stuff so if I was cornered, I wanted to have my equipment. It was like I wasn't even in control, like someone else was pushing me.' 

No court has ruled Panetti was or is incompetent or insane. He has told lawyers his scheduled punishment was part of a satanic conspiracy to prevent him from preaching the gospel.
