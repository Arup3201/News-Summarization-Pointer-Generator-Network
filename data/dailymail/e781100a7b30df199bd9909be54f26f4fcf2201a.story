The author of the new James Bond book, says he deliberately wrote about women and African people 'not in a way Fleming would write them'.

William Boyd, the third writer in recent years to pen a new installment to the classic spy series, said he found it difficult to read the descriptions 
of 'negros' and chapters entitled 'Nigger Heaven'.

Boyd, who was born in Ghana in 1952 and spent his childhood travelling between Africa and his Scottish boarding school Gordonstoun, said: 'It's unbelievable to read now. I think if you were of that privileged upper class, born at the 
beginning of the 20th century, you were probably racist, sexist, right 
wing and anti-Semitic.'

Departure: William Boyd says he had great respect for Ian Fleming, but his own work was better written

The writer, whose works include bestsellers such as 
Restless, said he admired Ian Fleming's style, but chose to write in his
 own way in the novel Solo, which will be published on Thursday.

And although Boyd's 007 is in bed with a beautiful woman by page 86 of the novel, he said he had written about the spies relationships with women differently, saying of Fleming's novels: 'The sex can veer from terrible Barbara Cartland romanticism to almost sadism.

'I deliberately wrote those scenes well, not in the way Fleming would write them,' he said.

The 61-year-old admitted in an interview with The Times that he had had arguments
 with the Fleming estate, which authorised him to write the new novel, 
over his plot line that made Bond into an assassin.

Sexist: Boyd says he wanted to depart from the sometimes 'sadistic' treatment of women in Fleming's novels

Boyd said he had a high regard for Fleming, having featured him as a character in his novel Any Human Heart, saying the novelist would be his specialist subject on Mastermind.

He has written the scripts for films that have involved Bond actors Daniel Craig, Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan.

Boyd said he felt his style matched the sentiment of the original Bond books - although he accepted that some hard-core 007 fans might be disappointed with his decision to tweak the original writer's style, even having his spy drive a Jensen rather than a Bentley or an Aston Martin.

Solo, published by Random House, is set in West Africa in 1969.

It follows 45-year-old Bond on a freelance mission that takes him across the continent and to Europe and North America - via a multitude of drinks and two different women.

He has previously said that he 'accepted at once' when the Ian Fleming estate asked him to write the new novel, saying it was 'incredibly exciting and stimulating - a once-in-a-lifetime challenge'.

Boyd is the third author in recent years to write a fresh addition to the Bond series.

Sebastian Faulkes published Devil May Care in 2008, followed by Carte Blanche by Jeffery Deaver in 2011.
