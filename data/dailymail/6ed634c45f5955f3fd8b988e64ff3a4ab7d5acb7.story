Sick: Dimitris Aspiotis was handed the jail-term by a court on the Greek mainland for re-offending after his release halfway through a six-year sentence

A Greek rapist known as the 'Beast of Kavos' who attacked at least seven British women in Corfu was jailed for a record 52 years yesterday.

Dimitris Aspiotis, 39, will not be considered for parole until he is 91, which is believed to be the longest sentence given in a Greek court for rape.

Three of his British victims gave evidence against the cocaine-snorting thug in a trial in Igoumenitsa, on the Greek mainland.

The brutal knifepoint attacks took place in the space of just a month-and-a-half, after he was released halfway through a six-year sentence for sex attacks on other British tourists.

Following his repeat offence in August 2010, he appeared in a magistrates court on the holiday island and was ordered to return to a mainland prison.

He was also charged with violating the terms of his release while on a suspended sentence for rape and robbery of British women since 1997, when he was 25 years old.

Aspiotis would trap the women on a woodland path after partying with them on the beach and repeatedly rape them for hours.

A holiday rep from Preston, Lancashire, wept as she described her ordeal in court.

'He would talk to me politely, calmly, and then rape me,' she said. 'Within that time he raped me a total of six times.

'He would tell me in broken English, "Come on, it is not terrible, I am not a bad man. If you do not resist it will be better."

'He would ask, "Is it good? Say yes".

'I feared he was going to kill me to get rid of the evidence.'

Instead, Aspiotis showed her back to her hotel before taking her money and a phone, The Sun reported.

Grave offences: Aspiotis is sent back to prison to complete his previous six-year sentence for robbery and rape in 2010. Today the 39-year-old was told he would not be released until the age of 91

A 45-year-old British holiday rep was also raped by Aspiotis in the woods for hours.

The woman, from London, said: 'He was forceful and very threatening, sexually totally aggressive.

'Then he would be polite and almost friendly.'

Again, Aspiotis took her money and phone then let her go. His third victim was on her first lone holiday abroad as an 18th birthday gift from her parents.

Greek police believe Aspiotis attacked even more British tourists.

The Beast, who admitted rape, robbery and assault, begged for leniency, saying he was 'ugly' and that 'forcing myself on them was the only way I could secure physical contact with women.'

Earlier, his brother yelled from the court corridor: 'Give me a gun and Iâ€™ll shoot him myself.'

Greece yesterday sent out a message that it was determined to protect its valued women tourists.

When homeless Aspiotis failed to turn up with a lawyer, one was appointed by the state by ballot so the trial could take place. All the female lawyers refused to participate in the ballot.

According to Foreign Office statistics, Greece has the highest number of British rape victims in the world.

This is believed to be due to the excessive drinking of young holiday makers and the fact that the country still has vast stretches of isolated beaches.

There was a scandal at the time, when it emerged that detectives had identified him as their prime suspect immediately after the rape on 12 July 2010 - but waited until he had raped four women before calling the British Consulate to help hunt him down.

Police forced his surrender by cutting off all his access to food, to his family and to possible friends.

Disturbing: The 'Beast', who would party with tourists on a Kavos beach before raping women on a woodland path, said he was 'ugly' and had no choice but to force himself on women

Aspiotis was unemployed and lived in poverty in a 'hovel, hardly a home', with his parents, his brother and sister.

He had never married and told magistrate Apostolos Hajipantazis at the time: 'My family and I live like animals.

'We have no real home, and I myself have been rejected by society because of my past. I have no work and no hope of making a proper living. I know that no woman will accept me.

'So rape and robbery was the only solution left to me to satisfy my basic needs.'
