A northeast Missouri man has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and other charges aftr police say he killed an elderly neighbor, dismembered the body and tossed the victim's arms at bystanders.

Paul R. Potter, 49, pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Adair County court to charges of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, first-degree tampering with a motor vehicle, second-degree arson and first-degree burglary charges.

Potter is accused of stabbing Willis Edward Meredith on January 6 at a Kirksville apartment complex where the two men were neighbors.

Prosecutors have accused Potter of slaying Meredith, butchering the man’s body and setting fires to conceal the crime.

Police said in a probable cause 
statement that the suspect threw the victim's severed arms at passersby
shortly before he was taken into custody.

Potter appeared via video from the Adair County Jail with his attorney, Kevin Locke, on Tuesday.

Locke told the court the defense would
file a motion to have Potter committed to the Missouri Department of 
Mental Health, pending a decision by the court on Potter's competency to
stand trial.

On the evening of January 6, police 
were called to Village 76 apartments at 170 Valley Forge Drive in 
Kirksville on a report of a car on fire in the parking lot.

When cops arrived, they found the vehicle consumed by flames, as well as two nearby apartments that were also on fire.

Amid the commotion was 49-year-old Potter, who could be seen hurling 'objects' at onlookers.

The 'objects' were found to be the arms of another man who was found stabbed to death inside one of the torched homes, according to the Kirksville Daily Express.

Potter surrendered to officers and was arrested on charges of second-degree murder, arson and tampering with a motor vehicle.

The murder charge against Potter was later upgraded to first degree after he was questioned by police.

In an interview with invesitgatros, Potter allegedly waived his Miranda Rights and stated that he was angry when he entered Meredith's apartment armed with several knives and stabbed the man in the head and face, the newspaper reported.

The motive behind Potter's rage remains unknown, but witnesses at the scene said he believed that Meredith had somehow harmed his son.

An autopsy later showed that 'sharp force wounds to the left lung and heart' contributed to Meredith's death. 

It has not been revealed how old Meredith was, but officials said that he was born in Iowa and went by the name Jake Steadman.
