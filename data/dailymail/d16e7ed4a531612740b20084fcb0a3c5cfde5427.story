President Barack Obama nominated Janet Yellen for the top spot at the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, in a move that would see the central bank led by a woman for the first time if she is confirmed.

Obama introduced Yellen as a 'proven leader' who is 'tough, not just because she's from Brooklyn.'

He credited the current Fed second in command for being a consensus builder, adding: 'She understands the human cost when people can't find a job.'

Historic: Yellen, if confirmed, will become the first woman to ever hold the position and will replace current chairman Ben Bernanke

Yellen had been widely tipped to 
succeed current chairman and confidant, Ben Bernanke, who steps down 
after an eight-year stint, which coincided with the worst financial 
crisis since the 1930s.

The pair appeared alongside the President at the White House when Mr. Obama will made the formal announcement.

'Ben Bernanke is the epitome of calm, and against the volatility of global markets he's been a voice of wisdom and a steady hand,' Obama said.

Yellen, 67, emerged as the leading 
candidate after Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary whom Obama
 was believed to favor, withdrew from the contest last month.

A
 close ally of Mr Bernanke, she has played a key part in keeping 
interest rates low to support the economy.

In accepting the nomination, Yellen said more still needs to be done to strengthen the recovery.

She said the past six years have been tumultuous for the economy and challenging for many Americans. She said that while the recovery is not complete, 'we have made progress, the economy is stronger and the financial system is sounder.'

It is believed she will continue the work started by her predecessor, when he steps aside in January.

The
 announcement comes as the country is gripped by a partial economic shutdown and the looming breach of the nation's $16.7 trillion borrowing limit.

The
 President has criticised Republicans for demanding either changes in 
health care or spending policies, in return for paying for government 
operations and raising the debt ceiling.

Shutdown: President Obama is not expected to use Yellen's nomination as an opportunity to score points

But sources at the White
 House said Obama was unlikely to use Yellen's 
nomination announcement as an opportunity to score political points on 
the shutdown.

Moody's
 Analytics chief economist, Mark Zandi, argued the timing of the 
announcement has probably been designed to send a signal of policy 
stability to the financial markets.

Investors
 are growing increasingly concerned over the shutdown and what they 
believe will be the larger threat of a default on Treasury debt if 
Congress does not raise the borrowing limit by the time it hits it on October 17.

Mr Zandi said: 'Markets are very unsettled and they are likely to become even more unsettled in coming days.

'Providing some clarity around who will be the next Fed chairman should help at least at the margin.'

Becoming
 vice chairman in 2010, Yellen helped to balance the bank's traditional 
method of exerting control over the economy through short-term rates, 
with the unconventional programs it launched to help steer the economy 
through the financial meltdown of 2008.

These included monthly bond purchases and guidance to investors about the likely direction of rates.

After the financial crisis erupted in 2008, under Bernanke's leadership the bank created programmes that are credited with helping save the US banking system.

It lent money to banks after credit markets froze, cut its key short-term interest rate to near zero and bought trillions in bonds to lower long-term borrowing rates.

Task ahead: Yellen will be taking over at a time when the Reserve will roll back its support for other banks

Senator Tim Johnson, who heads the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which must approve Yellen's nomination, said he would work with the panel's members to advance her confirmation quickly.

He added: 'She has a depth of experience that is second to none, and I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman.'

Senator Chuck Schumer, a committee member, described Yellan as 'an excellent choice'.

Obama's choice of Yellen coincides with a key turning point for the Federal Reserve.

In the coming months it is expected to start slowing the pace of its Treasury and mortgage bond purchases as the economy starts to recover.

The program had been intended to keep loan rates low to encourage borrowing and spending.

While economists were united in their view that Yellen's appointment was a strong signal of continuity, she will inherit the difficult task of rolling the bank's support without causing major financial market upheaval.

DMJ Advisors chief economist David Jones said: 'Yellen is not going to rock the boat in terms of her approach to monetary policy. But it will be her challenge to reverse this prolonged and unprecedented period of monetary ease.'

Even after the bond buying programme is scaled back, the bank's policies will remain geared toward keeping borrowing rates low to help stimulate growth and cut unemployment, which currently stands at 7.3 per cent.

Few expect to see the short-term rate increase much before 2015.

Yellen had long been considered a logical candidate for the chairmanship in part because of her expertise as an economist, her years as a top bank regulator and her experience in helping manage the bank's polices.

Before the crisis struck, she was among a minority of top economists who predicted subprime mortgages posed a severe threat to the economy.

New dawn: If she is successful, Yellen will become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve in its history

As vice-chairman, Yellen has built a reputation as a 'dove' - someone who is typically more concerned about keeping interest rates low to reduce unemployment than about raising them to avoid high inflation.

Her nomination could face resistance from congressional critics who argue that the bank's low-rate policies have raised the risk of high inflation and lead to bubbles in property and assets, such as stocks.

Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he voted against her for vice chairman in 2010 because of her dovish policies.

He said: 'I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed.'

Yellen has pledged that when the economy finally begins growing faster she will begin to increase rates to prevent high inflation.

Yellen drew outspoken support from Senate Democrats, a third of whom signed a letter this summer urging Obama to choose her.

And last month, more than 350 economists signed a letter to Obama urging him to nominate Yellen.

If confirmed by the Senate, Yellen would be the first Democrat chosen to lead the bank since Paul Volcker was appointed by Jimmy Carter in 1979.

And she would also be the first vice chairman of the Federal Reserve to go on and be appointed to the top spot.

Yellen served as a board member for 
three years in the 1990s before leaving to head the Council of Economic 
Advisers in the Clinton administration.

She
 also served for six years as president of the Reserve's regional bank 
in San Francisco before Obama chose appointed her to the number two spot 
on the seven-member board in Washington.

Yellen, like Bernanke, was a distinguished college economics professor before she joined the central bank.

She
 taught at the University of California in Berkeley between 1980 and 1994
 when the then President Bill Clinton chose her to join the Federal Reserve board in 
Washington.

She served on 
the board of governors until February 1997, when President Clinton chose her to 
lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

If she is successfully appointed to the role, Yellen would not only be the first woman to head the US central bank; she also
 would be the first woman ever to head a major central bank anywhere in 
the world.
