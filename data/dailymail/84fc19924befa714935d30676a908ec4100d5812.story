The wife of Mets pitcher Kris Benson appeared in court today looking pale and disheveled in a navy prison jail suit where a judge denied her bail because of a prior murder charge.

Anna Benson is accused of breaking into her estranged husband's home with a gun and a metal baton and threatening to kill him if he didn't give her $30,000.

The Baseball Wives star was charged with the murder of a man in Tennessee in 1996. She was on the run for five months and though the charges were later dropped, she is considered a flight risk and a threat to others.

Benson's attorney asked for $50,000 bond as well as an ankle monitor and psychological treatment. But Judge LaTain Kell denied this.

'Despite the Court’s order that 
Defendant vacate the marital residence, she allegedly returned to the 
home with a handgun, ammunition, a knife, and a metal baton and 
threatened her estranged spouse and demanded money from him,' Kell wrote
in his decision.

'There was no evidence presented that the domestic 
circumstances which preceded these alleged events have changed.'

The 37-year-old former FHM model has been in jail since July 7 and it has obviously taken its toll on her.

She was indicted for criminal attempt to commit armed robbery, burglary in the first degree, two counts of aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during commission of a felony.

Officers arrived at the 1160 block of Drewsbury Court to find Benson, star of the VH-1 reality series, Baseball Wives, wearing a bullet proof vest and an ammunition belt containing several rounds.

She had a Batman knife in her waistband, a police-issue baton in her hands and a revolver in her purse, according to the incident report, obtained by the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

The 911 call made by Kris Benson was later released and the Mets pitcher sounded calm as he quietly told the operator he is hiding in the basement.

Listen to Kris Benson's 911 call:

Threat: Kris Benson called police from his basement after his estranged wife Anna allegedly broke into his home on July 7

'She told me to go get a lighter for her to smoke a cigarette,' Mr Benson said in the 911 call, which was released by TMZ.

'When I left the room, I just did a beeline for the basement.'

As the operator tells him to stay on the line, Mr Benson can be heard saying: 'I just got my hand on the back door in case I hear her coming down the stairs.'

He then fled the house and hid in his neighbor's garden until police arrived.

When the 911 operator asked him what his wife had said, he explained that he had managed to record her. 

Mr Benson also appears to stifle a shocked laugh when he explains that his 'soon to be ex-wife' was wearing a bulletproof vest when she allegedly threatened him.

Mrs Benson however, told the New York Post last month: 'I would never hurt [Kris]. I am still in love with him.'

She added: 'We have been married for 15 
years, and he can’t keep it in his pants. He can’t stop f*****g my 
friends, in my house. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t love him.'

Mrs Benson was arrested on July 7after allegedly breaking into his home wearing a bulletproof vest and threatening him with a gun and metal baton. 

She reportedly barged in on Sunday night and ordered Mr Benson to give her $30,000 after she was forced by the court to vacate the couple's marital home, TMZ first reported. 

The mother-of-three was wielding an 'expandable metal baton' and threatened to hit him if he didn't give her the money.

She also brandished a handgun and a loaded ammunition belt, according to a police report reviewed by TMZ.

Mr Benson, who filed for divorce last 
year, left the home and called police.

He was not injured but Mrs Benson reportedly smashed his computer with the expandable metal baton.

She said the reason she was wearing a bulletproof vest was because of a deal she had made with the manufacturer.

'It was a new model she was testing for a company,' police report she said.

TMZ reported that she alleged 'had to wear it for an extended time to get it to mold to her body.'

When police arrived at the scene, she yelled that her husband was a 'f****** p****'.

She was made temporarily famous by VH1's 'Baseball Wives,' a 2011 reality show that was cancelled after only one season.

Mr Benson pitched in the majors for five teams - including the New York Mets - from 1999 to 2010, when he retired.

He married the former exotic dancer and model, at the start of his major league career in 1999.

The couple have had a rocky relationship, including bouts of cheating and more than one divorce filing.

In 2006, Mrs Benson filed for divorce after she allegedly caught her husband cheating on her with one of her friends.

The couple, who have three children,
decided to  stay together- even though she had 
famously told Howard Stern that she would sleep with the entire Mets 
team if he ever cheated.

She
later told ESPN, however, that she was kidding around with her comment 
to Stern and that she wouldn't touch 'some of those guys with a 10ft 
pole.

'I don't care what Kris did. Some of them are disgusting.'

In
another divorce filing from 2012, Mrs Benson again accused her husband 
of cheating, saying she found racy messages between him and one of her 
friends on Facebook.
