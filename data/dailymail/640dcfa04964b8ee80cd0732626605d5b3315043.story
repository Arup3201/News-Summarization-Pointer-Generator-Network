More than 50 drunk teenagers trashed a family home after spotting a Facebook post which said the 15-year-old daughter was having a couple of friends over.

Horrified mother-of-four Karen McGuinness, 47, of Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, was forced to return early from a holiday after neighbours called and told her drunk youngsters were trashing her home.

She had gone away for a short break believing her children were all out for the night, when daughter Simona, 15, returned to the house with a couple of friends to listen to music on Saturday night.

But when one of Simona's friends posted on Facebook that she was off to an 'empty' she posted the address of the £75,000 house - and plans for a quiet night went out of the window.

Around 50 teenagers, most of them unknown to Simona, descended on the house in the upmarket suburb and caused thousands of pounds worth of damage in less than an hour. 

Neighbours went to the house at the height of the mayhem and told the yobs to leave but were ignored - so they called Mrs McGuinness at around 10.30pm.

Mrs McGuinness, a single mother and support worker at a school for children with special needs said she was 'traumatised' after rushing home and seeing the destruction to her property.

'They totally trashed my house. Every part of my home is ruined. What kind of kids are out there doing this?' she told the Daily Record.

The teenage yobs pulled her son's TV off his wall, before stamping on it and even chucked his Xbox out of his bedroom window.

Mrs McGuinness said she had locked her bedroom door before she left, but when she returned home she found it had been kicked off its hinges and will need to be replaced.

The yobs also damaged the stairs, bannister and walls, smashed her outside decking to pieces and even emptied her cupboards and fridge. 

A devastated Mrs McGuinness found her home covered in flour, sugar, pasta and smashed eggs, ruining her carpets, cushions and curtains.

She said: 'Liquids were poured over my bedding, the bathroom was covered in shampoo, shower gel and toilet paper, and toothpaste was everywhere.' 

To make matters worse the teenagers vomited copiously throughout the house and Mrs McGuinness says she is still cleaning up.

She also says someone stole her set of rosary beads which had belonged to her father - who died just six months ago.

Mrs McGuinness has said she has no idea how she will pay to repair all the damage, as her insurers are refusing to pay out - arguing the teenagers were technically invited to the house.

She added that the incident has left her feeling vulnerable in her own home.

She said: 'This is a nice area. I've lived here 20 years and you'd never think in a million years that this could happen. 

'I can't understand what type of families these children come from.'

When neighbours called the police,  officers found the vandals still at the scene but did not make any arrests.

Most of the teenagers fled through neighbours' gardens, trashing them as they went.

Mrs McGuinness said two boys even picked up a stone bird bath and threw it through a car windscreen as they ran.

She says she has managed to track down some of the children who invaded her home and found they are all from the local area. 

Mrs McGuinness plans to ask their parents if they know what their children get up to when they are out.

She added she wants to warn other parents about the dangers of Facebook and other social media sites, and said she does not want anyone else to go through what she has gone through.

She said: 'I wasn't aware of the extent of Facebook and was totally oblivious to the power of it.'
