Even though Becky Tully loves her three boys with all her heart, she had always craved a baby girl who she could dress up, style and spoil like a real princess.

So when doctors told Mrs Tully that she could not have any more children, the 38-year-old was devastated about giving up her dream.

But the former care home worker soon found comfort - in five life-like plastic dolls.

Becky Tully, 38, from south London, who has three sons, adopted five life-like dolls after she was told she could not have any more children. The babies - Emma, James, Max, Sophie and Connor - are treated as part of the family

Now their doting 'mother' has spent £17,000 buying the silicone models - known as reborn dolls - their own cots, dummies and stylish wardrobes to make them part of the family.

Mrs Tully said: 'The boys thought it was a bit strange at first, but once they knew how happy their mummy was, they didn’t mind.'

Mrs Tully, from south London, already had three sons  - Joshua, 20, Jack, 17, and Jacob, 11 - when she had to undergo a hysterectomy in 2009, after developing endometriosis and liver disease.

The mother-of-three - who had to give up her job in a residential care home because of her illness - became so unwell that her husband Andrew, 40, became her full-time carer.

As well as being house-bound for months on end, Mrs Tully was heartbroken that she would never have the chance to mother a young girl.

But Mrs Tully's life was completely changed one year later, when she saw a documentary on TV about the reborn dolls.

The silicone dummies are hand-picked by would-be mothers for
 their realistic weight and soft feel, although they lack the sounds and 
smells of a real baby.

Just days later, Mrs Tully had ordered Sophie - who she even designed with matching brown hair, so she would look like part of the family.

Mrs Tully, pictured here with one of her babies Max, has now spent £17,000 on clothes, accessories and prams to make the five children her own. She says she often scrimps and saves to ensure her babies - who have more than 500 outfits between them - never have to wear the same outfit twice

She said: 'I
 spent £840 on Sophie with the care home wages I had left, but it was 
worth it - I fell in love with her straight away. These babies are so 
unique and precious.

'I ordered Sophie from an online reborn artist and paid for her over nine months in instalments.

'Waiting for her to arrive almost felt like a real pregnancy - it was so exciting.

'I wanted her to look like she could be a part of the family, and her dark brown hair matched mine exactly.'

Sophie, pictured left, was the first doll to be adopted by Mrs Tully in 2010. She loved Sophie so much that she went on to adopt four more babies, including Emma, pictured right

Sophie was the start of a new-found love for Mrs Tully.

In the following year, Mrs Tully bought another four dolls - Emma, James, Max and Connor - who she started showering with lavish gifts.

She changed their nappies, gave them dummies and put a cot in her bedroom for the babies to sleep in.

She even spent more than £5,000 on clothes for the dolls, as well as £500 on shoes, ensuring they never had to wear the same outfit twice.

Mrs Tully loves shopping for her the dolls' outfits at GAP, Next, George at ASDA and Mothercare and has spent £5,000 on clothes alone for the babies

The reborns have more than 500 outfits between them and Mrs Tully loves shopping 
for the clothes at GAP, Next, George at ASDA and Mothercare.

Dolls - £8,000

Clothes - £5,000

Shoes - £500

Cots, cribs and prams - £1,000

Baby accessories - £2,000

Hair accessories and hats - £500

Mrs Tully says she scrimps and saves to pay for new outfits for reborns, sacrificing treats for herself to spoil the children.

She says: 'I’ve taken the babies to Bluewater Shopping Centre, and I’ll often treat them to a day out at our local wildlife park.

'Me
 and Andrew take them out shopping together and, although he was 
embarrassed at first, now he’s more than happy to take over Daddy-duty 
and hold their pram.

'He knows how happy they make me and when my oldest son moves out, he’s going to help me turn the spare room into a nursery.'

Mrs Tully’s reborns are so realistic that shop assistants often can’t believe she’s cradling a fake baby.

Mrs Tully says the bill for the dolls' shoes comes to more than £500. She also spent £500 on hair accessories and hats, as well as £2,000 on what she described as 'baby accessories'

She said: 'I love going to Claire’s Accessories to buy pretty hair slides and accessories to style the girls' hair.

'One day the shop assistant was cooing over Sophie, and couldn’t believe it when I revealed she wasn’t a real baby.'

For Mrs Tully, her new 'children' have brought her the happiness she never thought she would feel.

'Sometimes
 I will hear people talking about the dolls, questioning whether they’re
 fake or not, but it doesn’t bother me, they make me happy.

 'I love my boys so much, but I desperately wanted a little girl so I could style her hair and pick out pretty dresses'

'I was heartbroken when I had to give up work, and then to make matters worse, my dream of having another child was also in tatters.

'Andrew had to give up his job as a lorry driver to look after me. Now he’s my full-time carer.

'I love my boys so much, but I desperately wanted a little girl so I could style her hair and pick out pretty dresses.'

Mrs Tully said the rest of her family have also learned to love the dolls.

She said: 'Andrew doesn’t mind sharing our bedroom with the dolls, and I’ve even taught my youngest son how to care for them too.

'He knows how to hold their tiny heads properly, and will put them to bed for me.

'I’ve brought three prams, two moses baskets, a swinging crib and play gyms for the babies to use.'

The reborn addict hopes to expand her brood and has recently ordered her most expensive baby yet, Evie Margaret, priced at £900.

Mrs Tully said: 'I said I wouldn’t buy any more dolls, but I couldn’t resist Evie, she was too cute.

'Evie will have new outfits for special occasions, and just like the other babies, she won’t leave my side.

'I know I’ve spent a lot, but Andrew supports my spending because these babies have changed my life.

'Some people might think it’s strange, but it’s only the same as men being obsessed with cars - instead my obsession is reborn babies.

'My health condition does get me down and these babies have brought me so much happiness.

'Nothing can ever replace the love I have for my real kids, but I still love my vinyl brood, and I’ll keep making a special home for them.'
