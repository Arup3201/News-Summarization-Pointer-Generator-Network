Lembit Opik has contacted the police to report an assault after having coloured powder thrown at him during a Hindu festival. 

The former Liberal Democrat MP turned television presenter, 49, was filming a segment for the Iranian government owned PressTV outside a college in Bloomsbury in Central London when three young men threw the substance at him before running away.

Despite powder-throwing being an integral part of the ancient Indian festival of Holi, Mr Opik told MailOnline that he did not believe the men were taking part in the celebrations and said he saw 'no benign cultural or religious significance' to the 'shocking' and 'unprovoked' attack.

Mr Opik said he believed the three men who carried out the 2pm assault were 'white males in their late teens or early 20s', adding that he did not know what their motivation was.

He said onlookers were left stunned by the attack, adding that although students celebrating Holi in the area, 'there was no doubt that it was nothing whatsoever to do with the religious and cultural celebration going on at the time.'

'There's absolutely no possibility whatsoever that they though that I or anyone else in that particular locality had anything to do with the powder-throwing element of the religious ceremony,' he added.

Mr Opik said he felt the attack was 'entirely opportunistic' and had been designed either to attack him either for political reasons, because he is a recognisable figure, or in order to disrupt the filming.

'People not known to me all unanimously agreed that it was a shocking incident,' he added.

Mr Opik said that although some of the powder went in to his eye, there was no lasting effect and he did not not require medical assistance.

Describing the substance, Mr Opik told
 MailOnline: 'Quite possibly the powder they used was the same powder 
being used for the religious festival, but it wasn't being used in that 
context.'

'It was being used
 because either they recognised me, or they recognised what I was doing,
 and they decided to play a rather stupid and ill-considered prank.'

Holi is an ancient spring festival in the Hindu calender that is also known as 'The Festival of Colours' or 'The Festival of Love'. 

Although primarily observed in India and Nepal, the celebrations have attracted revelers from around the world in recent years thanks to the bright colours and joyful atmosphere.

The colour aspect of the festival is believed to come from an ancient Hindu legend that Krishna was worried the fair-skinned deity Radha would not love him due to his blue skin.

Despairing of her son, the legend says Krishna's mother Devaki allows him to change Radha's skin colour to whatever he chooses.

One key aspect in the Holi celebrations is the large 'carnival of the colour' that takes place on the morning after the Holika bonfire.

During the carnival, worshipers chase each other and throw coloured powder, paint and water balloons.

Everyone near the carnival is considered fair game, with revelers often attacking strangers and the elderly with the coloured paint.

It is believed that students from Hindu Societies at University College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies had organised Holi celebrations in the Bloomsbury area when Mr Opik's assault took place.

'I
 can't be sure of their motivations  - I'm simply sure their motivations
 weren't to embrace me in the religious celebrations going on at the 
time,' he added.

Mr Opik said the 
police agreed with him that an assault had taken place and said a number
 of witnesses came forward to assist to assist the investigation.

However Scotland Yard said their investigation has already been closed 'pending the receipt of any new information'.

Mr Opik said that his PressTV team, who had been filming a section for Mr 
Opik's weekly half-hour programme, had lost the entire day's filming as a
 result of the attack.

'You 
can't film when you're covered in paint. People will think you're some 
kind of an art installation or that I'm making some kind of an artistic 
statement. It may have won me a Turner award but it wasn't going to win 
me a Bafta,' he told MailOnline.

In the aftermath of the attack, Mr Opik said: 'I think Iâ€™m known for having a sense of 
humour but frankly this kind of thing is incomprehensibly stupid. I 
wonder if the people who did it will think it was funny enough to 
deserve the convictions which they are likely to get as a result.'

Mr Opik went on to liken the attack on him the incident when then Prime Minister Tony Blair had purple paint thrown at him in the House of Commons by a Fathers For Justice protester.

'I think any politician who was in the chamber at the time they the powder at Tony Blair has still go a chilling recollection of that. Because that could have been anything.'

'No one in Britain could accuse me of being humourless and not being able to laugh at myself, but that's not the issue. The issue is that this kind of behaviour is at least is utterly stupid, and at worst could cause long term harm... where do you draw the boundaries?,' Mr Opik said.

Lembit Opik's career as a Liberal Democrat MP was often as remarkable for his cartoonish behaviour and well-known girlfriends than his political achievements.

County Down-born Opik became Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire in Wales in 1997, becoming leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats in 2001.

In four successive Liberal Democrat leadership contests, Opik backed campaigns that collapsed, leading to talk of the 'curse of Lembit', and making his support for a prospective leader undesirable.

Lembit Opik's career as an MP was often as remarkable for his well-known girlfriends (left with ITV weather forecaster Sian Lloyd, and right with Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia) than for his political achievements

On 13 April 1998 Opik came close to death in a near fatal paragliding accident, falling 80 feet onto a Welsh mountain in his constituency, and breaking his back in 12 places.

Opik was in a relationship with ITV weather presenter Sian Lloyd for a number of years in the 2000s, with the couple coming close to marrying. However they split in October 2006, with Lloyd later blaming 'women and alcohol' and Opik's 'rowdy, drunken behaviour' for the split.

Opik later started a relationship with then-24-year-old Gabriela Irimia of pop music double-act The Cheeky Girls. He announced their engagement after proposing in Rome, but the couple split in late 2008 after a 'difficult period'.

While serving as an MP, Opik made regular appearances on comedic television programmes - chiefly Have I Got News For You.

After failing to become the Liberal Democrats' nominee for Mayor of London in 2012, Opik took part in a wrestling match against professional fighter Kade Callous (pictured)

He was openly ridiculed by stars Paul Merton and Ian Hislop after making an appearance on the show on the day after he lost his seat as an MP during the 2010 General Election.

Vowing to take up comedy instead of politics, Opik made his debut as a stand-up at the Backstage Comedy Club in London's West End two months after losing his seat

Hi show was described by one audience member as 'not fantastic, but not completely awful', although a resulting tour saw increasingly small audience numbers.

Two years later Opik put himself forward to be the Liberal Democrats' nominee for Mayor of London but was knocked out in the first round, receiving only 252 votes.

The wrestling promoter said Opik lasted two minutes in the ring and was taken to hospital with minor injuries

Following the disappointment, Opik's next attempt to break into the entertainment industry saw him take part in a wrestling match against professional fighter Kade Callous.

According to the promoter, Opik lasted about two minutes in the ring before being taken to hospital with minor injuries.

Opik has since appeared on numerous reality television programmes, including Stand Up for the Week, Come Dine With Me, and I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

Mr Opik said he wanted to meet 
his attackers to ask them why they carried out the attack in the hope of
 proving it had nothing to do with the Hindu festival of Holi.

'Through
 the pages of the Mail I would like to extend an invitation to the 
people who did this. If you want to claim this was part of the 
celebrations, come meet me and explain it to me.'

'I
 will be happy to listen - with a Daily Mail reporter on hand to ensure 
fairness - I would be happy to listen to why you thought it was a 
reasonable thing to do.'

The attack on Mr Opik took place as students from University College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies gathered in nearby Gordon Square for a three hour event to celebrate Holi.

The festivities typically involve people throwing coloured powder at each other to celebrate the start of spring.

Scotland Yard said that the investigation into the alleged assault had been closed pending the receipt of new information.

'Police were called to Russell Square, WC1, at 15.15hrs on 19 March following reports of an alleged common assault,' they said in a statement.

'It was alleged that three suspects approached the victim, a 49-year-old man, and threw a powder at him before running from the scene into a crowd of people. The victim did not require medical treatment.

'Officers from Camden borough began an investigation into the circumstances. This has since been closed pending the receipt of any new evidence or information.'
