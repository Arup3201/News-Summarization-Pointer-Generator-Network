The centre forward: The leader from the front, the No 9, the provider, the talisman, the goalscorer. Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry.

In this international week, we are begging for goals, and these lot put the ball in the back of the net and make it look easy.

Here, Sportsmail runs you through Nos 50-41 of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League... do you agree?

50. Alan Smith (Leeds United, Manchester United, Newcastle United)

Smith burst onto the scene as a teenager at Leeds, scoring on his first-team debut against Liverpool as an 18-year-old and proving an inspirational force in their memorable run to the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2001.

Blessed with a tireless work rate, Smith was admired by the Elland Road faithful and twice voted the Supporters' Player of the Year. 

That turned to hatred when he joined Manchester United following Leeds’ relegation in 2004 and Smith was gradually converted into a central midfielder which curbed his goal threat. He scored 45 Premier League goals in total.

49. Tony Yeboah (Leeds United)

A Ghanaian striker with an eye for the spectacular, Yeboah illuminated Elland Road for two seasons in the mid-nineties, scoring 32 Premier League goals in 66 matches. 

Capable of beating defenders at will and with a rocket of a shot, Yeboah was a regular contributor to Goal of the Month shortlists.

His volley against Liverpool and those kick-ups followed by a blistering shot against Wimbledon are the ones that stick in the memory.

48. Kevin Davies (Southampton, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers)

Davies first shot to Premier League prominence with Southampton in the 1997-98 season, grabbing the headlines with important goals against Man United, Chelsea and Liverpool. 

He failed to live up to his £7.5million price tag at Blackburn but did much better at Bolton after moving there in 2003. 

A bruiser of a frontman, Davies had his disciplinary problems but was a reliable goal-getter too. In all he scored 68 Premier League goals for the club, guaranteeing heroic status.

47. James Beattie (Blackburn Rovers, Southampton, Everton, Stoke City, Blackpool)

Beattie forged a prolific career in the Premier League, scoring 90 goals in all for Southampton, Everton and Stoke City while also representing Blackburn and Blackpool. 

Part of the aforementioned deal that saw Kevin Davies move to Blackburn, he made a name for himself at Southampton with consistent goal returns. 

The 2002-03 campaign, in which he scored 23 league goals and helped them to the FA Cup final, was the highlight. 

He went to Everton in a £6m move in 2005 but couldn't find his Saints form.

46. Yakubu (Portsmouth, Middlesbrough, Everton, Blackburn Rovers)

Plucked from the Israeli league by Harry Redknapp, Nigerian Yakubu proved a tremendous success in the Premier League.

He helped establish Portsmouth as a top-flight club with 29 goals across two seasons, earning a £7.5m switch to ambitious Middlesbrough in 2005. 

He helped Boro to the UEFA Cup final during his first season, also scoring 13 in the league. Everton spent a club record £11.25m to sign him in 2007 but misfortune with injury after his first season there reduced his goal tally. 

Yakubu rediscovered his touch at Leicester in the Championship and then Blackburn, memorably scoring four in one game against Swansea.

45. Daniel Sturridge (Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool)

One of the brightest and best strikers produced in this country in recent times, Sturridge has spectacularly realised his potential at Liverpool in the last couple of years. 

His 21 goals propelled them to within touching distance of a first Premier League title last season and his importance to the team has been highlighted by their travails in his absence through injury this time round. 

It is often forgotten that Sturridge, still only 25, started out at Manchester City before moving to Chelsea when first-team opportunities were not forthcoming. 

The 2011-12 campaign was the clear highlight of his time at Stamford Bridge but he has flourished at Anfield and is set be the main man for club and country for many years to come.

44. Louis Saha (Newcastle United, Fulham, Manchester United, Everton, Tottenham, Sunderland)

Fearsome French goalscorer Saha fired Fulham into the big time in 2001 with 27 goals in their promotion season. 

His strikes helped establish Fulham as a Premier League outfit, with the 13 in 21 he scored in the first portion of 2003-04 persuading Manchester United to fork out £12.4m for him. 

These weren’t the most successful of times for Sir Alex Ferguson’s side and Saha was by no means a first choice, a situation not helped by injury niggles. 

In all, he scored 28 goals at Old Trafford before joining Everton, helping them to the 2008 FA Cup final.

43. Micky Quinn (Coventry City)

Quinn was one of the hottest strikers in the Premier League when it launched in 1992 and had been a proven goalscorer for many years with the likes of Stockport, Oldham, Portsmouth and Newcastle United. 

That reliable scoring touch continued following a move to Coventry City and Quinn scored 10 goals in his first six matches in the new league. Sky Blues fans will fondly remember his Highbury hat-trick in a 3-0 win in 1993-94. 

Rather, let’s call him, stocky, Quinn had a few unflattering nicknames (his autobiography was called ‘Who Ate All The Pies?') but what a presence in the box!

42. Peter Crouch (Aston Villa, Southampton, Liverpool, Tottenham, Stoke)

Crouch has made a very successful career out of his freakish height, playing and scoring for half a dozen top-flight clubs as well as England, for whom he scored 22 in 42. 

‘Two-metre Peter’ first made an impression at Portsmouth in the First Division and joined Villa and then Southampton. 

Their relegation in 2005 resulted in a £7m switch to Liverpool and he contributed 42 goals for the Reds after a slow start. 

His hat-trick against Arsenal in a 4-1 win back in 2007 was the highlight. Crouch went on to spend two years at Spurs before joining Stoke in 2010. He has 90 Premier League goals in total.

41. Dimitar Berbatov (Tottenham, Manchester United, Fulham)

Probably the most laid-back striker to play in the Premier League, Berbatov’s elegance and style yielded an impressive haul of goals. 

The Bulgarian arrived at White Hart Lane from Bayer Leverkusen for £10.9m in 2006 and he scored 27 times in league competition for Spurs in his two campaigns there. 

He was named the club’s Player of the Year and was in the PFA Team of the Year in his debut campaign, then helped them win the League Cup in 2008. That sparked interest from Man United, who paid a mammoth £30.75m for him. In all, he scored 48 league goals for the club, winning league winner’s medals in 2009 and 2011.

Highlights include that hat-trick - including an overhead kick - in a 3-2 win over Liverpool and a five-goal haul against Blackburn. He scored 19 goals in 51 league games for Fulham after leaving Old Trafford in 2012.
