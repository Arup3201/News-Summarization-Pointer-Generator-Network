A devoted son who wanted to pay tribute to his mother found her the perfect Mother's Day gift - a new home.

Michael Luangrath described his hard-working mother as his 'hero', and revealed his torment at watching her battle cancer and then lose her house during the recession.

So he devoted months to finding her the perfect new home, and on Sunday handed over his mother's surprise present.

The blogger chronicled the process of buying the house in a touching video which has been uploaded to YouTube.

Mr Luangrath spoke of his heartbreak at seeing his mother diagnosed to cervical cancer in 2002, forcing him to give up work to care for her.

'I slowly saw her deteriorate, I saw her become a shell of the person she once was,' he said.

Although she recovered from the illness, she was left with hefty medical bills and forced to work non-stop at the shop and restaurant she owns in Las Vegas.

The Nevada city was particularly badly hit by the financial crisis and recession, forcing the hard-working mother to sell her home and move into a cramped apartment.

'When I walk through where she stays, I can't help but tear up,' Mr Luangrath said in the video before he found her new house.

His mother talked in the clip - which she thought was going to be an advert for her business - about the struggles she had endured since falling ill.

'I work every day, seven days a week, I never get a day off,' she said. 'For 30 years, I never got a vacation.'

Mr Luangrath decided to buy her a new house, even though he does not own his own home.

The sale finally went through on Friday - two days before Mother's Day.

The loving son picked up his mother from her business, and pretended that he had to go and pick up a friend.

But when they drew up outside the house, Mr Luangrath delivered a tearful speech paying tribute to her as he handed over a small box containing the keys.

Relatives gasped in shock when he finally revealed that he had bought his mother a house.

When he posted the video of the gift on YouTube, Mr Luangrath wrote: 'This is the first house I ever purchased and I wanted to give my mother a home before myself because she deserves it the most.

'This was in honour of all the mothers out there that work their hearts out. Your children see that and will reward you dearly for everything you have done.'
