Most people check in to a hotel looking for a good night's sleep, but that is not the plan at Thorpe Park this Halloween.

Horror fans can put their bravery to the test this October by checking in for the Fright Nights challenge.

Locked in the park, guests will be bagged and blindfolded, chased by a sacrificial cannibal cult who feast upon human flesh, and taken on a horrifying backstage tour of the Thorpe Park Movie Studios and horror mazes.

Night terrors: A new overnight experience at Thorpe Park, The Extra Cut, promises that guests will not enjoy a peaceful night's rest

Things that go bump in the night: The experience, for people over 18, includes being kidnapped, bagged and blindfolded, and chased by a cannibal cult

The Extra Cut, a new overnight experience from the Surrey theme park's Fright Nights, is open to those aged 18 and over who book into the Thorpe Shark Hotel.

Once the park has closed at 10pm, the gates will be shut and the overnight guests will be locked in an abandoned theme park, which won’t be as empty as it seems.

Hotel guests will receive a mystery invite from the 'Director' before being dragged from their rooms by a dishevelled and bloodied production crew to enter the park's Halloween Horror Mazes.

They will also face death by cannibal and have to hunt for a photograph of themselves in order to ‘stay alive’.

Lurking in the shadows: For an extra fright, guests can book a Night Terror - a creepy creature who will appear in your room in the dead of night

But the drama isn't over. Once they find their picture, they will be bagged and kidnapped in the back of a van before being delivered back to their hotel room disorientated.  

The experience runs until 2am... but the terror doesn't end there.

Unwelcome creatures could be hiding in the shadows of your hotel room when you switch off the lights (if you book the Night Terrors add-on option, that is).

Also available to book is a Bedtime Gory Teller – a dishevelled, greying character with yellow stained teeth and rancid breath who will read you horrifying ‘Hairy Tales’ from her book while you’re tucked up under your duvet.

Fright night: The Extra Cut takes place from 11pm to 2am and will run on selected dates throughout October

If all that horror hasn't satiated your craving for a scare, the hotel has a selection of on-demand horror movies available.

Rooms also feature rain shower wet rooms, free wifi, and mood lighting.

The Extra Cut takes place from 11pm to 2am and will run on selected dates throughout October. 

Prices, based on four people sharing, are from £125 each including overnight stay, two-day park tickets, breakfast, complimentary parking plus exclusive First to Ride time.
