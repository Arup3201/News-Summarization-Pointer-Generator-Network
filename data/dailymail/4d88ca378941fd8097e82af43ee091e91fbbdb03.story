Reading have issued a hands-off warning to Leeds over academy boss Eamonn Dolan.

Dolan has been heavily linked with the vacant manager's job at Elland Road to replace ex-Royals chief Brian McDermott, who left the Yorkshire club last month.

But Reading's director of football Nicky Hammond insists the club have no intention of letting Dolan leave his current role, which he has held for almost 10 years.

Wanted: Reading's academy manager Eamonn Dolan has become a leading candidate as Leeds United boss

Hands off: Reading said in a statement that the club will not welcome any approaches for key staff

In a statement on the Royals' website, Hammond said: 'Reading FC are aware of the interest of another Championship club in our academy manager Eamonn Dolan.

'Eamonn is an integral part of our club and is under contract to Reading Football Club. Eamonn has done an incredible job since taking over from Brendan Rodgers and we hope he will be a big part of our club for many years to come.

'He has a fantastic relationship with our manager Nigel Adkins and we do not welcome any approaches from any club for our key staff. We hope this is the end of the matter.'
