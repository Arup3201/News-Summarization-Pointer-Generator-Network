Wrapped up against the cold and clutching one of his favourite toys, brain cancer patient Ashya King waved from his wheelchair today after his final session of proton therapy treatment.

But the five-year-old, who has been treated in  Prague for six weeks, will not return to Britain because his parents do not feel 'safe' enough to return.

The Kings sparked an international manhunt when Ashya was taken from Southampton General Hospital because they believed NHS treatment would have left him deaf, blind and brain damaged. 

They were traced to Spain where at the request of the British authorities Ashya's parents were put in a prison and the five-year-old held in hospital under armed guard with no family allowed to see him.

His father Brett said today: 'At the moment we don't feel 100 per cent safe contemplating being in England.

'There is so much still at stake. We wouldn't want to lose Ashya. It would probably never happen but just having that small risk that you don't have to do anything wrong to have your children taken away and be thrown in prison'.  

Brave: Ashya King waves as he leaves the thirtieth and last of the proton treatment sessions at the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague, Czech Republic today

Proud: Ashya's mother Naghmeh smiled as her son posed for pictures outside the Czech hospital unit

Care: Paramedics lifted the five-year-old into an ambulance and is set to start a new life in Spain because Britain is not 'safe', his parents say

Ashya was eventually allowed to be treated at the Czech Proton Therapy Center (PTC).

Doctors today said the five-year-old has responded well to therapy but has not fully recovered as he took the last of 30 sessions of the therapy at a clinic in Prague.

But Mr King said today they will head to Spain, not back to Hampshire.

Fears: Mr King, holding his son, said that they fear the authorities would take Ashya from them

Speaking while holding his son, Mr King told Sky News: 'After some time we decided that perhaps it was best to return to Spain.

'We have a property there so life can be established quite easily for us.

'At the moment we don't feel 100 per cent safe, I suppose you would call it, contemplating being in England until perhaps they do this investigation into how everything was conducted for us.

'Once that has been established then we can think about going back to England. But for the time being we have been in contact with a doctor in Spain so we are continuing with (Ashya's) treatment in Spain instead of England.'

Iva Tatounova from the clinic told Sky News: 'We always thought Ashya would benefit from the specialist treatment here at the PTC.

'And whilst he is still not fully recovered, he's responded very well to the proton beam therapy and there is no reason that he will not continue to get stronger once he leaves here. 

'I don't know if you remember the pictures when he was transported here - just lying on his bed in the ambulance.

'Now he can sit on his own, he can play with the toys and his motorics improved dramatically. He can also react to his surroundings.'

The treatment is a more targeted way of destroying cancerous cells than conventional radiation using photon beams, but NHS guidance does not recommend it as the best form of treatment.

Five-year-old brain cancer patient Ashya King was filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted by his brother

Five-year-old cancer patient Ashya King  was seen for the first time since undergoing brain tumour treatment - on a family trip to a pizza restaurant with his older brother Naveed

Ashya was recently filmed on his first outing to the park with his family since he started his treatment in the Czech Republic.

The little boy can be seen smiling as he is gently lifted out of his pushchair in the Prague playground by his older brother Naveed, who then sits with him on a rocking toy while carefully supporting his head.

The footage, uploaded by Naveed, 20, then shows him playing with a giggling Ashya on a toy digger - much to the little boy's delight. 

It is apparently the first time that the seriously ill boy has been able to go to the park with his family since he started being treated in the Czech Republic. 

He was also pictured at a pizza restaurant clutching a favourite toy and looking healthier than he has done for weeks in an image also shared by his older brother. 

Ashya's parents removed him from Southampton General Hospital without the permission of doctors  and took him to Southern Spain where they planned to sell a holiday home to fund the alternative treatment.

Brett and Naghmeh claimed that they were threatened by the authorities about seeking alternative treatment. 

After his treatment in Prague ends today they are unlikely to return to the UK and continue his treatment in Spain. 

Poignant: Ashya clutching his favourite toy as he started another round of treatment in Prague

University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust have repeatedly said they absolutely refute the suggestion that the King family was threatened.

After being tracked down they were arrested and thrown into a Spanish jail for three nights.

They were released following a public outcry and reunited with Ashya who had been removed and put into a hospital in Malaga.

Ashya previously had major surgery to remove a brain tumour on 24 July and a further operation on his brain on 22 August.  

Mr and Mrs King faced a legal battle to get their child to Prague after removing Ashya from hospital on August 28, with a High Court judge approving the move after they had been released from police custody in Spain.

Ashya's 30 visits to the Proton Therapy Centre had 13 treatments focusing on the brain and spine, to ensure the tumour he had removed has not spread, and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was.
