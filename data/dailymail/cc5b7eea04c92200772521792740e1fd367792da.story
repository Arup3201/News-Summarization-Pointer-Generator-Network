A Russian woman has gone to bizarre lengths to show how much she dislikes President Obama--she's gotten it tattooed right on her arm.

What's more, 28-year-old Eugene Tolkcheva's message tells the American president that he is banned from having sex with her.

'Barack Obama is denied access to the body,' reads the Russian-language inking she got in protest of sanctions in place against Russia in the wake of the annexation of Crimea.

No sex with Obama: A Russian woman has started a strange campaign that asks her fellow countrywomen to ban the president of the U.S. from having sex with them

Lucky for Tolkcheva, the tattoo was done with henna and is temporary.

The Omsk woman was sure to clarify that the Obama ban does not imply an invitation for others.

'[It does not mean] everyone else can,' she told Omsk Here.

Tolkcheva said the tattoo is her unique way of showing solidarity with Russia in opposition to American and European sanctions on the nation and for Omsk, specifically.

Tattoo you: Eugene Tolkacheva, 28, got a tattoo proclaiming her pledge. The bizarre campaign is in response to American sanctions on some of Russia's rich and powerful

Tolkcheva has begun a campaign that asks her fellow countrywowen to follow suit and ban the president from having sex with them.

Hers is just one method that pro-annexation Russians have used in their retaliatory 'sanctions' of Obama.

Stores and other establishments across Russia have banned the president personally.

Putin himself has issued sanctions against high level U.S. officials.
