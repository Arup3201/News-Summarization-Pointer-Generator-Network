It is one of the biggest events on 
the UK celebrity calendar and gives our girls a chance to show off the best of British on the red carpet.

The Glamour Women of the Year Awards is also not one to be missed by leading ladies across the pond, who make an annual pilgrimage to Mayfair in London for the prestigious ceremony.

Now in its tenth year, the bash attracts a stellar list of guests with last year’s winners including the likes of Kylie Minogue, Donatella Versace, Jessie J, Jessica Alba, Fearne Cotton, Amanda Holden, Eva Longoria, and Dionne Warwick.

And while most ladies attending the event next Tuesday are 
hoping to take home a much coveted gong, it seems that all is not lost for those who miss out on an 
award.

Bag of tricks: The winners and presenters at the 2013 awards in association with Pandora will walk away with a goodie bag worth £3,000 and even non-winners will take home this £300 one

It has been revealed that honoured 
nominees and A-list presenters at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards will all receive goodie bags 
worth a staggering £3,000, and judging by the contents, everyone really is a 
winner.

Featuring in excess of 70 gifts, this is the event's most exciting and indulgent goodie bag yet.

Famous faces: Jessie J and Katherine Jenkins are among previous attendees at the glitzy awards

Including a Pandora gold heart ring, Aspinal of London notebook and a £100 My-wardrobe voucher, the VIP attendees are in for a stylish treat.

And it's not just the winners who get presents. Every guest will be walking away with some arm candy as smaller goodie bags, worth £300 and packed with the likes of Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour Cream, a copy of the Revenge wears Prada book and even a bottle of David Beckham Classic Fragrance, will be available at every table place.

Glamour's Women of the Year Awards honours the celebrities, politicians, local leaders, and athletes who have helped empower and inspire women this year.

The best takeaway ever? The winners will take home a bag worth £3,000 packed full of beauty and fashion goodies

Whilst the winners and attendees are yet to be announced, nominees include Mad Men stars January Jones, Christina Hendricks and Elisabeth Moss, Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt, comedian Miranda Hart, singers Jessi J and Rita Ora and sportswomen Victoria Pendleton and Jessica Ennis.

Glamour readers have been voting for their favourites in categories such as Best Presenter, Best Solo Artist and Designer of the Year in a celebration of all things female.

Last year the Fashion Designer of the Year gong went to Donatella Versace while Eva Longoria was commended for her inspiration and Jessica Alba took home the Entrepreneur award.

Other awards ceremonies famed for their overflowing goody bags include the BAFTA's which saw celebrities take home a £2,500 bag full of gifts including Lancome skincare and makeup products, Tattinger
 Brut Reserve champagne, a painting of the Diamond Jubilee river pageant
 from the Savoy and even an invitation to stay at Villa Maria Estate in 
New Zealand.

Beauty bag: The bag will include St Tropez tanning products and Sanctuary Spa goodies too
