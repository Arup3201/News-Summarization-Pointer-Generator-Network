Little Mayzee Jo Gaspa's shocking injuries after being attacked by the Staffordshire bull terrier in Archway, North London

These are the shocking injuries suffered by a toddler after she was mauled by her neighbour's Staffordshire bull terrier.

Mayzee Jo Gaspa needed 240 stitches and surgery after being set upon by the  beast at her  home in Archway, North London.

The child's mother Maria Dew told how the animal dragged the 18-month-old 'round like a rag doll' after pouncing. 

'Looking at her after it let her go, I thought she was going to die,' the 34-year-old said, told the Daily Mirror.

The Staffordshire bull terrier had been brought into little Mayzee Jo's home by a neighbour, who was talking to her mother.

Ms Dew recalled her daughter's 'horrendous' screams during the attack, which took place five months ago.

The panic-stricken mother battered the animal in the mouth in order to get it to release little Mayzee Jo, according to the newspaper.

Police and paramedics were called to reports of a child being bitten by a dog just after 6pm on Saturday, September 6 last year. 

'Officers attended and the child was taken to an east London hospital,' said a police spokesman. 

Mayzee Jo's mother reportedly said she underwent emergency surgery after being airlifted to hospital from the scene. 

She almost lost her nose in the ordeal and still requires further treatment to repair the damage, according to the Daily Mirror.

Ms Drew and Mayzee Jo's father, Michael, have decided to release the shocking images to caution other parents about the dangers of these dogs.

The Staffordshire bull terrier's owner Gemma Neil admitted having a dog dangerously out of control at Highbury Corner Magistrates Court on October 29 last year.

The 28-year-old is due to be sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court on February 27. 

No decision is believed to have been made about the fate of the dog that is being kept in kennels, according to the Daily Mirror. 

Mayzee Jo's mother said that she was dragged 'round like a rag doll' during the ordeal and needed 240 stitches

The Dangerous Dogs Act applies to all dog owners in the UK regardless of their breed or size. 

Under the Act, it’s illegal for a dog to be ‘out of control’ or to bite or attack someone. 

The legislation also makes it an offence if a person is worried or afraid that a dog may bite them

Those convicted of the offence where a person has been injured can face up to five years in prison. 

The RSPCA say if anyone is concerned about the behaviour of their pet then they should consult a behaviourist.
