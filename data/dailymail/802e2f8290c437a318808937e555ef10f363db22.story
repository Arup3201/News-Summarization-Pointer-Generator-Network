Fifty Shades of Grey has got nothing on the sexual awakening of one British mother who has self-published her own 'erotic true-life memoir' on Amazon.

Emma Styles, a married mother-of-two from Kew, London, has written First Tango In Paris, in which she relates how she went from being a bored housewife to having outrageous sexual encounters with a string of lovers including  a team of firefighters and a distinguished French diplomat.

Emma explains how her 'sexual journey' began when she was 29-years-old and she and her husband, Paul, took an eye-opening trip to Paris.

Erotic journey: Emma Styles went from being a bored housewife to having a 'decadent' sex life with multiple lovers

She writes: 'Until that night I was living a relatively normal existence as a married woman with two young children in a small commuter town in Surrey. I was a 29-year-old stay at home mum, whose husband Paul worked long and intense hours in the music Industry, which meant he wasn’t around as much as other fathers and do his share of child care, however, the financial rewards were worth it.'

The couple started out attending sex shows and venues famed for swinging but were initially 'both reticent, and unsure as how each other would react if either had any intimate contact with anyone else.'

But she recalls how an encounter with a French couple, Olivier and Claudia, at a club that 'appealled to the higher echelons of the Parisian swinging culture' caused them to relax their 'rules of engagement'.

Experimental: Emma said her encounters with other men enhanced her sex life with her husband (posed by models)

Emma relates how she had an intimate sexual encounter with Olivier in an alcove of the club after they left their respective partners to buy drinks.

She said of the liaison: 'I was in complete ecstasy, not having had this level of close up personal attention from another man in seven years of marriage.'

'I was in complete ecstasy, not having 
had this level of close up personal attention from another man in seven 
years of marriage'

When they returned to their partners and Claudia asked 'if she could take Paul and
 show him around her "favourite areas" of the club' she said 'who was I to argue!'

While some people may be horrified at the thought of their husband or wife with another person, Emma said it enhanced their marriage.

She said: 'Our personal sex life had become very intense, and experimental, with 
Paul, who during our lovemaking was very much into having me tell him in
 detail about my liaison with Olivier, and what else I wished I'd done 
with him, and would do if the opportunity arose in the future. This very
 much excited him.'

Liberated: The mother went on to have numerous sexual encounters juggling family life with exploring her fantasies (posed by models)

Real erotica: Emma said her book is all true

From then on, the couple become much more adventurous with Emma learning how to 'juggle her family life in West London with her decadent sexual life in France and beyond.'

She said: 'All the liaisons took place with my husband, or flying solo, as a 
fully liberated woman (with his full approval), who knows what she wants
 and lets nothing stop her from turning her fantasies into reality… 
however unattainable they may seem.'

Emma told MailOnline her book differs from the many other erotic novels currently storming the bestseller lists because it's all true - and she isn't hiding behind a pseudonym.

She said: 'Where my book is different is that it is a true-life memoir of my sexual journey emanating from a weekend break to Paris back in 1991 and my subsequent story.

'The book is not a novella written by a faceless person usually using a ridiculous pen name such as Portia, Skye etc with equally unbelievable central characters with names such as Ayden, Gideon and Steele. I have never met people with such names in the real world.'

She added: 'I don't in any way class my book as pornography but pure and simple factual erotica written for today's modern woman by a woman who is real and has lived it.

'I hope it inspires women from wherever and whatever age you are, to 
embrace your sexuality, and explore fully the deep dark erotic side that
 we all have (some hidden deeper than others).'
