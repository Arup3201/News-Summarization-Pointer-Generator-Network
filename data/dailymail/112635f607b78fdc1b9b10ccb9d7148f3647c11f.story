The Australian businessman charged with horrific acts of child abuse acted as the ring leader of an international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to investigators.

Peter Gerard Scully's latest alleged victim, a 13 year-old girl, has told police she was supposed to meet one of the disgraced businessman's Australian clients and carry out lewd sex acts on camera. 

However, the girl told investigators plans were changed at late notice and Scully tried to sell her to a German man for the equivalent of $2924 instead, The Age reports. 

Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators.

Scully's alleged crimes are so heinous they have led to renewed calls to reintroduce the death penalty.  

Videos seized in the Philippines last week allegedly show the 13-year-old girl being forced to perform lewd acts with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators.

The videos shows whipping and torture along with other horrific acts, and was described by police as the most shocking child pornography that has ever been discovered in the Philippines.

His alleged victim was also forced to call him 'Uncle Peter' and started working for him, after he had promised to cover her schooling costs.

'Because (he) pay a big amount that's why I had to do that,' the girl said.

It is claimed Scully abused more than a dozen children in the three years he was in the Philippines, during which time he moved house frequently and assembled a team of more than four foreign accomplices and half a dozen Filipino workers in a lucrative 'pay for view' online child pornography business.

Reportedly, Scully slipped out of Melbourne and fled to Manila in 2011 after he allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme.

The 52-year-old was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission but avoided being charged with 117 fraud and deception offences, having departed Victoria.

He returned to Australia  accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling in 2011, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim.

'Because (he) pay a big amount that's why I had to do that,' his alleged victim told police investigators.

The allegations emerged after the father-of-two was arrested last month after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon.

He was formally charged on Friday. 

The Age reports Scully was never charged with child sex crimes in Victoria but a number of associates claimed he had a horrific sexual history. 

An unnamed former business associate, who lost more than $200,000 in the fraudulent scheme, told The Age he was neither surprised about the recent charges laid against Scully.

'Does it surprise me?' the associate told The Age.

'Yes and no. The signs were always there for him, but it's gone to a dark place.'

A search warrant was issued for his arrest in 2012 but Scully remained in the Philippines, where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme.

Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. 

It has sparked such an outrage in the Philippines that calls are growing daily to have him executed. 

The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death.

'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said.

The remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully after he was arrested

Scully avoided arrest until February 20 this year before a former partner told police that Scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013.

It was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully.

An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. 

Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. 

Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house.

Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them.   

The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task.

It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other.
