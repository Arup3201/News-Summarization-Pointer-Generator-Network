A father who killed his eight-year-old
 daughter after mercilessly torturing her with stun guns and hot irons 
has been sentenced to death in Dubai, it emerged today.

Wadeema al Sherawi had been deprived of food and locked up as punishment for being 'naughty' on the night she died.

In desperation, she ate her own faeces
 before vomiting and later dying.

Her body was found in the desert, but was so badly decomposed, forensic experts could not tell how she had died.

Her father Hamad Saoud al Sherawi, 
29, and his mistress Al Anood al Ameri, 27, were found guilty of 
torturing and imprisoning Wadeema and her seven-year-old sister Mira, 
who escaped death but suffered severe burns and injuries.

Horrific abuse: Wadeema al Sherawi and her sister Mira were tortured with hot irons and stun guns by their brutal father. Wadeema was forced to eat her own faeces after being locked in a toilet on the night she died

Following a seven-month trial, the Dubai Court of First Instance sentenced to Al Sherawi to death by firing squad and Al Ameri to life imprisonment, it was reported byÂ Gulf News.

The court heard the Emirati couple 
beat the girls with electrical wires and metal bars, poured boiling 
water on them and burned them with hot irons and cigarettes.

Wadeema and Mira, who was left with a permanent disability, were often left unfed and sometimes ate their own faeces.

Police corporal Mubarak Ahmed Taleb, 
34, told the trial that the studio apartment where the couple lived with
 the two girls was filthy and 'not fit for humans to live in'.

He told the court it reeked of stale 
urine: 'It smelled really bad and was dirty. There was only one bed and 
the furniture was turned upside down. The girls' clothes stank and there
 was mess everywhere.

'The fridge was full of food which was out of date. No one could live in it.'

Close to death: Mira survived the repeated attacks, but suffered horrific injuries as a result of the torture

Recovering: Mira plays with some toys in hospital. A forensics expert told the trial she was lucky to survive

He said when his investigation team 
searched the flat, they found two irons with brown marks on them and 
said: 'They had used them to burn the girls.'

He added they found some of the implements of torture, including metal bars, sticks and stun guns.

During the trial, Al Ameri clutched the couple's sleeping newborn baby to her chest as they heard the case against them.

The pair were arrested after the girls' uncle visited the flat in International City, Dubai, and was told by Mira of the abuse.

He initially blamed both of them for 
Wadeema's death but later changed his story, saying Al Sherawi was 'a 
great father who loved his children'.

Emirati police officer Essam Obaid told the trial: 'When I questioned Al Ameri, she 
claimed she saw Wadeema vomiting heavily and was very sick that evening 
so she called Hamad and asked him to come to the flat.

Justice: The girls' father, Hamad Saoud al Sherawi, has been sentenced to death, while his mistress Al Anood al Ameri, has been jailed for life over the abuse at their home in International City, Dubai

'They left her until 5am in the 
toilet and when they went to check on her, she was dead. She vomited 
because she ate her own excrement.

'Al Ameri admitted heating the irons 
and torturing the girls. She said Wadeema was tortured because she did 
not listen and was disobedient.'

Al Sherawi said he did not mean to kill his daughter, but didn't deny beating or torturing them whenever they turned disobedient.

Al Ameri
 initially pleaded not guilty, but later told the court that she claimed
 full responsibility for the crime and deserved the death penalty. She claimed Al Sherawi wasn't involved.

The girls' natural mother Salma Obaid
 had to give them up in November 2011 after losing custody and had not 
seen them for six months when Wadeema died.

She married Al Sherawi in 2002 and 
divorced him in 2006. She previously told the court she tried to 
convince him to let her see the girls but was forbidden contact with 
them.

A forensics expert said Mira had been lucky not to die from her injuries.

Al Sherawi, who was 15 days to 
appeal, will be put to death when the capital punishment becomes 
irrevocable and is endorsed by the ruler.

The girl's death has since inspired new child-protection legislation, known as Wadeema's law.
