Prince Harry told some 'eye-wateringly rude jokes' and drank champagne out of a prosthetic leg at the end of a marathon polar challenge, actor Dominic West has revealed.

The Wire actor, who was part of the Commonwealth team walking with Harry as part of the Walking With The Wounded trip, described him as a 'fantastically nice chap' and revealed a few of the prince's hidden talents - including building the team latrines.

The 29-year-old royal appeared at the 'welcome home' press conference in London today minus the increasingly famous beard he grew during the charity trek.

At the event, West described the prince as 'a really cool guy, very much part of the team'.

He said: 'He would often reach the 
meeting point before the rest of his men and would build these 
incredibly lavish, castellated latrines, with battlements and loo roll 
holders. It must have taken him 40 minutes at least to build, they were 
just fabulous. I would often sit on the latrine thinking "this is a 
royal flush in every way!"

'Harry also massively helped me out when I was struggling with my skis at first. He was a great guy.'

West
 also lifted the lid on some of the group's celebrations on reaching the South
 Pole.

He said: 'Two
 of the Aussie guys stripped naked and ran round the pole but most of 
us, Harry included, just went on a two-day bender with the Icelandic 
truck drivers who had brought some lethal home brew with them. There was
 a lot of liqueur drunk.

'We
 all drank champagne out of Duncan's (Slater, a double amputee injured 
in Afghanistan in 2009, who was on the British team) favourite 
prosthetic legs.'

And 
Harry's greatest talent? 'Well he told some eye-wateringly rude jokes 
which for a non-soldier like me was pretty shocking!' West revealed. 

Actor Dominic West, who was part of the Commonwealth team trekking with Harry, described him as a 'fantastically nice chap'

The prince was joined by fellow members of the three teams of wounded 
servicemen and women who successfully trekked to the South Pole in 
December 2013

The prince appeared at an official event for the first time today since the challenge looking fresh-faced and clean-shaven.

Speaking at the press conference to mark the charity trek, the prince’s enthusiasm for the cause was clear.

He
 said: ‘Inspiring others is one of the cornerstones of this charity.
 To demonstrate to those who have suffered lifechanging injuries that 
anything is still possible.

'That
 this truly unbelievable achievement by everyone behind me... will 
remind everybody that they can achieve anything they want to. Our 
wounded, injured and sick [servicemen] they simply want to be treated 
the same way as before they were injured. With respect.

‘For some the journey may be more of a 
challenge and it is up to us to make it as easy for them as we can. We 
can do that with training, with employment, or even with adventure.

The royal was full of praise for his teammates during the trip, all of whom have suffered terrible injuries fighting for their country, including one soldier who lost both his legs in Afghanistan

'If anyone has the ability to give these guys and girls a stepping stone as regards employment, then please do. You won’t regret it.’

His teammate Duncan Slater added: ‘Harry was a real team player. There was always something to do and he was always instigating it. There were so many wind ups. He probably spread himself quite thin. He would spend time with each team every day. He was always making sure he mixed, bringing everyone to the fore. It was very nice as he was as tired as everybody else. ‘

Referring to the team’s post trek champagne antics, he said: ‘We decided to use my legs as a primitive ice bucket. I don’t know why we did it, but we did!’

The
 fourth-in-line-to-the-throne started to grow his beard after being 
unable to shave during his three weeks on the ice but decided to keep it
 even when he returned to the UK just before Christmas.

On
 Christmas day his ginger whiskers were just as much of a draw at 
Sandringham as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and sparked an outbreak
 of ‘pogonomania’ (an obsession with seeing men with beards) on social 
media.

His facial hair even
 inspired articles in publications as far as the US and Australia, with 
Vanity Fair magazine describing it as ‘grizzly, red and perfect’.

In
 recent weeks there were claims that the Queen, who has famously barred 
her servants from sporting beards as she thinks facial hair looks 
unprofessional, had demanded her grandson shave it off.

This
 was dismissed by palace sources, however, who said the prince had 
decided to keep it because he fancied a change and would probably just 
shave it off before he went back to work.

Harry
 himself told well-wishers at Sandringham that he had decided to keep it
 because it was something of a royal tradition – no doubt referring to 
the beards previously grown by his brother, Prince William, father, 
Prince Charles, and grandfather, Prince Philip, when away on military 
duties.

Last week he was 
photographed walking with his girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, with his beard
 still intact, but by Thursday he appeared to have shaved it off, 
according to reports on social media.

And today all eyes were on the prince 
as he attended the press conference at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in 
Knightsbridge, just down from his apartment at Kensington Palace.

The
 prince was joined by fellow members of the three teams of wounded 
servicemen and women who successfully trekked to the South Pole in 
December 2013.

The Walking 
With The Wounded Virgin Money South Pole Allied Challenge 2013 saw the 
servicemen and women skiing across 208 miles of some of the most 
inhospitable conditions known to man, with temperatures of up to minus 
50 degrees and biting winds.

Every
 man and woman – some of whom were double amputees - also had to pull a custom built arctic sledge known as a pulk, weighing in excess 
of 11 stone, carrying their kit.

Last week Prince Harry announced he was quitting his job as an Apache attack helicopter pilot, after two frontline tours of Afghanistan, to take a desk job in London organising ceremonial events. Pictured, right, is a bearded Prince Charles as he leaves a plane from Canada

The terrain was so challenging that 
organisers were forced to suspend the race element of the trek and group
 all the competitors together for safety. 

Such
 was the camaraderie, however, the men and women linked hands as they 
walked the last few yards of the route to stand together at the bottom 
of the world .

The teams 
spent a total of four weeks in Antarctica, including the acclimatisation
 period and end of the expedition. The trek began on December 1st with 
the teams reaching the South Pole on Friday December 13th.

Prince Harry celebrated their arrival, declaring: ‘I think we’ll be having a few whiskies tonight!’

The
 royal was full of praise for his teammates, all of whom have suffered 
terrible injuries fighting for their country, including one soldier who 
lost both his legs in Afghanistan.

‘It
 will just prove to everybody that there’s so much that can be made 
possible when you think that nothing is left,’ said the prince.

Harry,
 who was also patron of the expedition, said from the ice afterwards: 
‘Every single one of these 12 deserves it. All 12 of them have 
different reasons for being here... but I’m so proud, I’m so chuffed, I’m 
so privileged to be here with all these guys and girls. What an amazing 
accomplishment.

‘I think we’ll be having a few whiskies tonight and then everyone’s looking forward to getting home. Mission success!’

Walking With The Wounded aims to make a difference to the lives of our wounded and injured soldiers.

Funds raised go towards training the wounded, injured and sick to assist them to find a civilian career outside the military.
