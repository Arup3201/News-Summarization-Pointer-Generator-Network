It seemed the perfect addition to their £1million home.

Trevor and Carolyn Taylor were delighted with their new patio, laid in slabs of finest Indian sandstone at the front of their property – named Villa Sogno, Italian for Dream House.

But other residents of the affluent commuter belt cul-de-sac were dismayed to find the couple had dug up and paved over a third of the road outside.

It meant cars had limited space to move at the end of the 100ft road, forcing drivers to perform multi-point turns to manoeuvre their way out of the leafy close.

Now, after a bitter legal dispute, a High Court judge has ordered Mr and Mrs Taylor to rip up the stonework as well as the fencing and gateposts they had cemented at its edge.

They had effectively sealed off the area for their exclusive use, the court heard, taking over what had previously been a turning point for neighbours’ vehicles.

Legal costs of fighting the case have left the Taylors £200,000 worse off.

But yesterday after a year of disruption and inconvenience, neighbours won their court battle to reclaim the land along the private road in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.

The town is one of Britain’s most exclusive – familiar to millions as the backdrop to film and TV locations, including one used for Inspector Morse.

Judges at the High Court ruled the Taylors must dig up their patio, remove the gateposts and fencing, and reinstate the road surface.

Amanda Tipples QC, deputy judge of the Chancery Division, said the ‘giant’ patio was a ‘substantial interference’ with other residents’ rights of way – and the Taylors had failed to show consideration for them.

Instead, she said, Mr and Mrs Taylor presented their neighbours with what they wanted to do – and then went ahead with it in spite of objections.

The judge did not accept the couple’s argument that they wanted the gates for security and said she believed they simply wanted to create ‘a large enclosed area that they can only use for themselves’.

The court was told in a hearing last month that the Taylors, who run a company that makes bespoke metal gates, wanted to turn the cul-de-sac into a gated close.

The two other couples living on the road – James and Helen Begley and Kenneth and Judith Mander – objected.

Instead, Mr and Mrs Taylor then proposed putting a gate ‘halfway down’ the close that would give access to all their homes.

A year later the Taylors’ solicitors wrote to the neighbouring couples to tell them building work was starting and they were advised they must keep the road clear ‘at all times’.

Before they could fully discuss the matter, gateposts were added and the fencing went up.

The judge observed that parking in the cul-de-sac had been ‘a real challenge’ since September 2012. She dismissed the Taylors’ counter-claim for a declaration that the neighbours were not entitled to access and that the gate would not interfere with their rights of way.

Last night friends of Mrs Taylor, 62, said she and her 65-year-old husband were ‘heartbroken and devastated’ over the ruling.

The Taylors bought the disputed land when they purchased Villa Sogno seven years ago, and they had always used it as a driveway.

They argued the previous owner used to keep six cars and a boat on it and that their neighbours did not use the land.

But neighbours claimed prescriptive rights over the land after saying they had exercised a right of way on it for 20 years, the period required under the 1832 Prescription Act.

It is understood the Taylors maintain they own the land, which is part of a private road, and therefore did not require planning permission for the patio.
