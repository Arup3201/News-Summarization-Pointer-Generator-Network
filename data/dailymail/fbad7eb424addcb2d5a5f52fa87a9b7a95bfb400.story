As you might imagine, being a professional alligator trapper, the job comes with some inherent dangers.

Firstly, there's always the possibility that you could fall into the swap or lake you've been assigned to, or get bitten by the mosquitoes.

However, there is always that niggling possibility that the gator itself might try and get the better of you.

Alligator rescuer: Jason Clark captures alligators for a living but even this 3 1/2 fella tested his skills

Spotted: Jason tries to bait the alligator to come over to him on the shoreline

Easy target: Or so it appears... but this gator has other plans!

This is what happened to one alligator catcher in Georgia.

Residents of Lawrenceville near Atlanta, spotted a 20 pound gator several months back in their usually peaceful lake.

Since last fall, reports of the 3 ½-foot gator, large enough to eat a small dog, was seen lurking beneath its still waters. It made the residents feel uneasy, especially if the gator grew any larger.

They called upon the services of Southeastern Reptile Rescue  husband & wife team, Sarah & Jason Clark whose specialism is trapping these scaly creatures once and for all.

No choice: Jason has the gator by its tail - he's coming out whether he likes it or not!

Got him: Within two minutes of spotting him, Jason had the gator by his tail

It wasn't long before the target was 
spotted basking in the spring Georgia sunshine. It took them four days 
before they were able to get close enough to capture it.

'It
 needs to be that first try to get him when he's like, 'I don't really 
know what they're doing,'' Sarah Clark told local station WSBTV.

Oh snap! Jason wasn't expecting that - and he does this for a living!

Bonded: The alligator is well and truly attached to Jason at this point, and probably thinks he's got himself a juicy meal

Making his mark: Jason won't forget this rescue any time soon. The alligator left between 15-20 teethmarks on his arm

Jason went to grab it, tail first of course, but what happened next he did not expect.

The aggravated alligator spun its head around and bit into Jason's forearm, tearing at his skin.

When alligators bite they can exert a jaw pressure of 3000 pounds per square inch. It's not an easy task trying to remove them.

'If he would have started rolling, he could have bit a chuck out of his arm,' Sarah, said.

'There's a gator bite for ya,' Jason laughed. 'Put the pole down. Grab his head,' he told her.

With his wife's help, Jason was finally able to free the alligator and its teeth from his arm.

See you later: Alligator captured and pond secured, the reptile will likely be taken to a local zoo so children can enjoy their beauty and learn about their dangers

No messing: Alligators can grow up to 14t long weigh over 450 kg. They can have up to 75 teeth

The gator certainly left its mark with around 20 teeth marks, but the residents are pleased that finally their pond is at last gator-free.

It's not known how the alligator ended up in the pond but it is likely that it was once a pet whose owner was unable to look after it once it grew larger.
