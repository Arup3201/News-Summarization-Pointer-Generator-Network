Hoilett arrived at Loftus Road with a fine reputation after impressing at Blackburn, and even turned down a move to then Champions League hopefuls Borussia Monchengladbach.

However, he has scored just six goals in 71 league appearances in west London, becoming a peripheral member of Harry Redknapp's side this season.

QPR could also see Matt Phillips leave the club this transfer window with Hull, West Brom and Derby chasing the former Blackpool winger. 

The 24-year-old has struggled for first team opportunities this season, with just 17 appearances
