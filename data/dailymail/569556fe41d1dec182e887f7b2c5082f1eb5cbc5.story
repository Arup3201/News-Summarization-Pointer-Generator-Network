Virtual currency Bitcoin has passed the $1,000 (£613) mark for the first time since it was introduced in 2009.

According to the currency's main exchange, Mt.Gox, the price for a single Bitcoin has almost quadrupled since its previous record high of $267 (£165) less than three weeks ago

Analysts claim the demand for Bitcoin 
follows increased awareness about benefits of the currency and a drive 
to move it into the mainstream.

Virtual currency Bitcoin has passed the $1,000 (£613) mark for the first time since it was introduced in 2009. According to the currency's main exchange, Mt.Gox, the price for a single Bitcoin has more than tripled since its previous record high of $267 (£165) less than three weeks ago

At the start of the month the currency more than doubled its value within a week - jumping from $100 to $266. It then hit $267 on 6 November. 

The digital currency is increasingly being treated like gold, with some investors using it to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on its rise.

Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy.

The current rises follow the launch of the world’s first Bitcoin ATM, dubbed Robocoin, in a Vancouver coffee shop.

The blue and silver ATM machine, which is operated by Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs and Nevada-based Robocoin, changes bitcoins to Canadian dollars and vice versa.

Users scan their hand to confirm identity, and then funds move to or from a virtual wallet on their smartphone.

The ATM, named Robocoin, allows users to buy or sell the digital currency known as bitcoins. Once only used for black market sales on the internet, bitcoins are starting to be accepted at a growing number of businesses

Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer 
digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as 
the Bank of England.

The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers.

Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy.

But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.

A Bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four years ago.

The system limits transfers to $1,000 (£623) a day, in an effort to curb money laundering and other fraud.

Bitcoiniacs, the local dealer that operates the ATM, will roll out four other kiosks across Canada in December.

By the end of 2014, they expect to roll the technology out worldwide.

Bitcoin is not a recognised currency in Canada, so Ottawa's anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre, does not monitor its trade.

Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers.

It is not backed by a single company or government, but its release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central banking system's control over the minting of money.

A Bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, made a huge profit, after forgetting he bought £17 of currency four years ago.

He recently found out he was sitting on a small fortune now worth more than half a million pounds.

Bitcoins are stored in encrypted wallets secured with a private key. Mr Koch had forgotten his password but when he eventually remembered it he was stunned by how much they had jumped in value.

The virtual currency is gaining hold among businesses and consumers, a key step to a bigger role.

‘I think it's definitely going mainstream,’ said Bitcoiniacs co-founder Mitchell Demeter.

‘I think as things progress, and the infrastructure is built, it will become easier for people to buy and sell, and so more people will start using it.’
