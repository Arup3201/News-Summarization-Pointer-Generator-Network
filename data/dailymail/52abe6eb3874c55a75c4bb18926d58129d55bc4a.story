A senior politician has told how Rolf Harris groped her when she was a young radio reporter preparing to interview the now disgraced entertainer during the 1980s.

New Zealand MP Maggie Barry said she was in her mid-20s and working at a regional radio station when she had to interview the star, who was touring the country at the time.

Ms Barry spoke out about her encounter with Harris as he faced a jail sentence today, after he was convicted on Monday of a string of sex assaults on girls between 1968 and 1986.

He said she had expected a light-hearted encounter with Harris, only to have to angrily rebuke him when the artist, now 84, put his hand on her leg.

'In the pre-record situation, when you're testing the 
microphones and all the rest of it, he suddenly started with the 
wandering hands and groping,' she told Radio New Zealand.

'When he put his hand on my leg I said "you can stop that right now" and I stood up and said "you're a sleazy creep".

'At that point he got a bit nasty and the publicist came in and smoothed things over.'

Ms Barry, now aged in her 50s, said that after she called out Harris over his behaviour he 'began to 
cut up rough (became angry) and protest and called me a couple of names'
 before the publicist intervened and he apologised.

Barry said she 
never reported the incident because it was 'on the absolute minor end of
 the scale' of the abuses committed by Harris, and she had largely 
forgotten about it until his trial began.

However, she said the incident showed howÂ 
Harris thought he could act with impunity because of his fame, and that the 
situation could have been far more serious if he had molested someone 
who was younger or more vulnerable and not willing to stand up to him.

'It seemed that he was pretty confident and arrogant if he thought he could try it on with someone like me,' she said.

'When you look back with hindsight, seems that even 30 years ago he had been getting away with a lot.'

Mugshot: The shamed star was found guilty of 12 counts at London's Southwark Crown Court on Monday

Harris is due to be sentenced later today, and faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in jail.

The shamed star was found guilty of 12 counts at London's Southwark Crown Court on Monday in unanimous verdicts by a jury of six men and six women.

Harris from Bray in Berkshire, was convicted of nine assaults between 1968 and 1985 - one on a girl aged seven or eight, and the rest on teenagers between 14 and 19.

The law at the time put the punishment at a maximum of two years, or five years for victims under 13.

The remaining three guilty verdicts were for three counts of indecent assault on Tonya Lee, who has waived her right to anonymity, in 1986 when she was 15, when the maximum penalty had changed to 10 years.

Mr Justice Sweeney will have to pass a sentence taking into account all the offending, and may consider Harris's old age.

On Monday he warned the musician's legal team that he is likely to face prison.

'In reality, given the conviction on all 12 counts, it is inevitable that the type of sentence that is uppermost in the court's mind is a custodial sentence and he must understand that,' Mr Justice Sweeney had said.

The once-loved entertainer was finally exposed as a serial sex offender at the end of his trial on Monday, his hypocrisy brought into sharp relief by the fact he had funded and starred in an educational film warning children of the dangers of paedophiles.

Police are now looking into dozens more claims from alleged victims in the UK, Australia and New Zealand.

The charges Harris was convicted of concern one woman who was groped when she was just seven or eight and asked for his autograph, another two who fell prey as teenagers, and a catalogue of abuse against his daughter Bindi's then best friend.

During the trial, the court also heard from six other women who claim they were groped by Harris while abroad, including one who told the jury the artist forced his tongue in her mouth when she was 11 or 12.

She was off sick from school at a family friend's house in Australia in 1969, when Harris told her: 'I want to be the first person to introduce you to a tongue kiss', before he pounced.

Prosecutors also tried to use evidence from another seven women with similar accounts, including a celebrity who said she was groped on live TV, but this was deemed inadmissible.

Since his conviction, Harris, who has been stripped of his Bafta fellowship and faces losing his CBE, has also lost an honorary degree from the University of East London.

Questions have been raised over the future of his artwork, which includes a portrait of the Queen, and authorities in his native Western Australia are planning to remove tributes.

His multimillion-pound fortune could also be badly dented by legal costs and compensation claims.
