A girl of 15 had to cope with a screaming heckler at the Labour Party conference yesterday after she spoke in praise of her academy school.

Resurrecting Old Labour’s views on education, the heckler sought to shout down Joan al-Assam, a Year 11 pupil from Paddington Academy in West London – even though the school  was a flagship creation of the last Labour government.

Joan, a star pupil at the academy which opened in 2006, sought asylum in Britain at the age of six from Iraq with just the clothes on her back.

Delegates were quick to condemn the outburst from one member of the audience in the Manchester conference hall

But when she made an emotional speech about how the school has helped her, she faced yobbish abuse from a woman believed to be a member of one of the teaching unions.

The heckler shouted support for comprehensive schools as Joan told the conference how she and her fellow pupils benefited from an arts education. The teenager, an A-grade student who was recently chosen to conduct an interview with Cherie Blair when she visited the school, continued unfazed.

Education Secretary Michael Gove last night condemned the ‘disgraceful’ incident and demanded that the heckler be kicked out of the Labour Party.

The intervention was an embarrassment for Ed Miliband and a reminder of the  left-wingers who oppose even the last Labour government’s education reforms.

When the Paddington Academy was set up in September 2006 to replace a failing school, just one in four pupils achieved five GCSEs including English and Maths graded A* to C, the main benchmark for success at age 16.

The
 academies programme (Paddington Academy, above) was first established 
under Tony Blair's Labour government to boost standards in poorer areas.

In
 2010, under the new coalition Government, Education Secretary Michael 
Gove opened up the scheme to allow all schools to apply for academy 
status.

Academies
 are semi-independent state schools, free from local authority control, 
that receive their funding directly and have more freedom over areas 
such as the curriculum and staff pay and conditions.

As of January this year, there were 1,529 academies in England, compared with 200 in May 2010 when the Coalition came to power. 

The
 previous Labour government introduced academies as a secondary-only 
programme but the Coalition has extended the freedoms to primaries.

Ministers
 can also use powers under the Academies Act 2010 to require schools to 
convert to academies if they are consistently failing.  

Last year that figure had soared to 69 per cent, even though three out of four pupils do not speak English as a first language. In 2011 the school also sent its first pupil to Cambridge University.

Teachers turned round the school with a focus on solid academic subjects such as maths, with every pupil measured against personal targets every six weeks, with the results published to encourage competitive improvement.

It also enforces a strict uniform policy and a code that ‘the street stops at the gate’.

The mood turned ugly  yesterday when Joan talked about arts programmes at the school.

‘Some of us explore our creativity through thousands of hours of brushstrokes and hundreds of hours of art. To many of you this may seem extraordinary that an inner city school offers so much, but to us at Paddington this is nothing but normal.’

At this point, the furious heckler yelled: ‘They do that at comprehensives too you know.’

There was a murmur of support from some seated with the heckler, but others booed the interruption and a woman shouted: ‘Leave her alone.’

The reaction to her coming under fire was instant on Twitter, where one viewer, Richard Angell said: ‘Appalled that a #Lab12 delegate heckled a pupil who came to UK as a political asylum seeker 4 championing the Paddington Academy she attends.’ Another called Lefty Lisa said: ‘Bad form. Delegate actually just heckled a year 11 student.’

The first three academies – state-funded schools independent of town hall control – were opened by Labour in 2002. A further 200 had opened by the time the party left office in 2010, mainly replacing under-performing comprehensives. The Coalition expanded the programme and allowed existing schools to gain the status as well. There are now more than 2,300.

Ministers attribute their good  results to greater freedoms enjoyed by heads, including over staff pay, the curriculum and the school calendar.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘No one should be heckled at a party conference, least of all a teenage girl making her first speech.’
