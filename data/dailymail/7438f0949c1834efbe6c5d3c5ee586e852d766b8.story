The Home Office’s third attempt to deport a drug-dealing asylum seeker who claims he is gay has been put on hold because he is suing them for thousands of pounds in damages.

Felix Wamala, a 43-year-old Ugandan, arrived in Britain illegally as long ago as 1995 and has so far beaten off every attempt to remove him.

He says that he left Uganda because he was persecuted for his sexuality and that he fears for his life if he returns.

He said: ‘I don’t consider myself any different from anyone else in Uganda who is gay.

‘The ones who are there, maybe they have found a way of living but most people are in hiding.

‘I don’t know that many people in Uganda who can shelter me and I cannot even see myself passing the airport security.’

Wamala claims that he was manhandled by the private security firm who were tasked with putting him on a flight back to his homeland.

He was finally thrown out of Britain in 1999, after being handed a seven-year jail term for a hard drugs offence. But, within weeks, he had re-entered the country and was not spotted again until 2006.

In 2010 he was convicted of shoplifting and the Home Secretary again signed a deportation order.

Despite publicly funded trips to the High Court and the Court of Appeal, his attempts to stay in the country on asylum and human rights grounds were condemned as ‘totally without merit’ by a series of judges.

However, it today emerged that Wamala is suing the Home Office and private firm, Reliance Escorts, for substantial damages, claiming ‘excessive force’ was used in an abortive attempt to put him on a Uganda-bound flight on Christmas Eve 2011 from Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre near Heathrow airport.

Mrs Justice Patterson said the Home Office had agreed not to deport him pending the outcome of his compensation claim.

The High Court heard that no less than four private escorts were assigned to accompany Wamala to the airport.

Wamala claims that he was subjected to ‘force and threats of force’ to get him on board the Qatar Airways flight.

Once on board, he informed cabin crew that he was being unlawfully removed against his will and, when he asked to speak to the plane’s captain, Wamala says he was assaulted and injured.

The judge said: “His removal was aborted. He was carried back to the escort van when he says that he was dropped.

“He has suffered from a back injury, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression subsequently”.

He also says that his claims about being gay have been ignored because he cannot provide the concrete proof about his homosexuality that the Home Office is demanding.

In a preliminary ruling which boosted Wamala’s compensation hopes, the judge said that he had earlier been told he would be on an Egypt Air flight and - although the ultimate destination was the same, Uganda - no removal directions had been issued for the Qatar flight.

She added that, quite apart from factual disputes about what actually happened at the airport, ‘questions arose’ as to whether there was any lawful power to load or offload Wamala onto the Qatar flight.

Although it was arguable that the escorts had ‘lawful authority’ to use reasonable force against Wamala that would have to be considered at a full trial.

A date for the full hearing of Wamala’s damages claim against the Home Office and Reliance Task Management has yet to be set.
