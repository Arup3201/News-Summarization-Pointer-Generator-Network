Former Chelsea manager Avram Grant is here in Brazil as co-commentator for Israel TV station Channel One.

He covered Uruguay’s opening game against Costa Rica last week and here is his guide to England’s next opponents.

Overall impression

In terms of personnel, Uruguay have changed very little from the team that reached the semi-finals of the last World Cup.

Nine of the players who started against Holland in Cape Town were on the field when they met Costa Rica.

But, oh, what a difference. Not in one area of the pitch did Uruguay play well in this game. It seems because they are older many of them are now slower.

Forlan and Lugano are not the players they were, for sure. England can win this game. They just need to be conscious of certain things.

Beware the counter-attack

This is where Uruguay are at their most dangerous, and it is how they like to play. Particularly up front where Suarez, Cavani and Forlan enjoy playing in the space which that kind of approach gives them.

I think they prefer to go into games as the underdogs. Because they were expected to beat Costa Rica, I think the situation got the better of them.

Pace is the key

If the England team that is being discussed is the one Roy Hodgson opts for then they will boast one of the quickest attacks in the tournament.

Welbeck and Sterling on the wings, Rooney behind Sturridge; this is a forward line that can inflict real damage against Uruguay.

They need to look at how Joel Campbell destroyed them. I told Arsene Wenger that Campbell played very well; he should be back at Arsenal for next season.

Fucile, who is set to come in for the suspended Maxi Pereira, has been struggling with injury. Sterling and Welbeck need to have confidence to run at the full-backs.

Midfield battle zone

This is where Uruguay were most disappointing. Arelavo Rios and Gargano were very poor indeed. They created nothing. It was like they didn’t want the ball.

Personally, and I will be accused of Chelsea bias here, I would be tempted to play Lampard with Gerrard against them.

Then you would have two players who could play those balls behind them. Even so, I believe England can dominate this area of the field.

England’s defence

This tournament has interested me because so many teams are playing three at the back. Holland, Mexico, Costa Rica and Argentina.

Juventus played this way too in winning the Italian title this year. As did Brazil when they won the World Cup in 2002. Although they had two great full-backs in Roberto Carlos and Cafu back then!

The English defence is a bit of a worry for me. Personally, I may have taken John Terry and Ashley Cole. So Cahill and Jagielka need to be at their best, even if I cannot believe that Suarez is really 100 per cent fit when he has been injured.

Tall order: England defender Gary Cahill has his work cut out

Like I said, it is as a counter-attacking team that Uruguay are at their most dangerous. I suspect Suarez will replace Forlan.

The former Manchester United player is no longer the force he was. But I wonder what threat Uruguay can pose on the flanks. Stuani and Rodriguez offered little against Costa Rica. That said, they cannot play that badly again.

I just cannot see them beating England. On the contrary, England will win if they attack with the same purpose they showed against Italy.
