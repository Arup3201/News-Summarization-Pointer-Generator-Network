It started out as an idea by a group of young radicals and evolved into a national icon over the years becoming the beating heart of youths across the country.

As the triple j contemplates middle age, Sounds like Teen Spirit, airing on the ABC, looks back on how one small alternative radio station became the finger on the pulse for Australia's youth culture.

Bursting onto the air as Double J in 1975 and controversially rebranding as it went national as triple j in the 1990's, it has played a vital role in unearthing new talent and staging major music events while changing the face of Australian music forever.

Adam Spencer knows all too well the importance of triple j within the cultural landscape when he won a stand-up comedy competition run by triple j radio called Raw Comedy in 1996 and started the graveyard shift at the station.

'I was surprised as anyone when I was halfway through my PHD in mathematics in Sydney uni that I found myself doing the midnight radio shifts on triple j,' he said.

'It was obviously not part of a bigger career plan.'

Spencer described working the odd hours as hilarious fun.

'You can do really weird and out there talk-back,' he said.

'There was a beautiful eclectic bizarre mix of people at 3 in the morning listening to triple j - I used to absolutely love it and it was a great way to learn the radio skills.'

Moving to the more civilised breakfast shift in 1999, Spencer formed a formidable duo with fellow comedian Wil Anderson for six years.

'We just don't talk over the top of each other - you can tell from body language,' he explained

'A lot of it is non-verbal communication is going on that the listeners don't know about.

'You are just looking at each other and one of you will give a sign of "don't worry I've got this covered" or one will be look at the other as if to say "over to you - I've got nothing".'

While Anderson joked that his time at the station was reminiscent of the 60's - 'if you remember your time there - then you weren't really there.'

Spencer thinks the recipe to the station's success was that the listeners outgrow the alternative youthful sound.

'It's that listeners generally get old and move on and think it's just ridiculous music they can't listen to anymore and think the station has turned uncool - which is great because it means it's just constantly appealing to new listeners,' he said.

He said the international acts who appeared on the station were blown away by the unique concept.

'They could not get the head around the concept - it was so original they would say "we've just promoted our show around the whole country in one 10 minute slot, that's awesome",' he said.

'Bands in the UK kind of understand it but it is so much cooler than Radio 1 - the idea that it's independent music and most of it local and national bands.'

A lot of artists and bands from overseas also greatly benefited from airplay in Australia on triple j.

'There was a period of time where the Dandy Warhols sold more albums in Australia than the United States because - there were just perfect for triple j,' he said 

'One of the reasons a lot of the big bands come to Australia and tour is because they are working off the networks they have built through triple j.'

But of course there are endless local acts that are forever indebted to the station's unique style.

'Bands like the Hilltop Hoods play to stadiums now filled with 20,000 people - it wouldn't have happened without triple j,' Spencer said.

Singer Missy Higgins won triple j's, Unearthed, a competition for unsigned artists, in 2001 which kick-started her career.

'They gave birth to me in a way which is a really weird thing to say,' Missy laughed.

Acts were invited to send in cassette tapes with the aim to get the invaluable air time for their original material as part of Unearthed.

'As many as 800 cassettes would arrive the afternoon of the cut off-date - you would literally get an armful of CD's take them home and listen to them,' Spencer said.

'Now 15 years on, that's an independent digital network - the Unearthed community is unbelievable.

'Bands who are heard on Unearthed get picked as support acts for other bands.'

Spencer said people forget that the station is a true pioneer in supporting up and coming artists.

'I think people take it for granted because it has been around for a while - if you look at the cultural footprint of it - it's quite amazing what it does,' he said

'You've only got to stop and listen to what other radio stations play for a few minutes to realise how important it is that we've got a station like triple j to play the music that it does.' 

He says another appeal is that the station doesn't sit alongside the top-rating FM commercial stations.

'It's consistently rated at five per cent in those markets - that's a million people Australia wide but you wouldn't want triple j rating 12 per cent,' he said.

'You would lose something if the station started playing the sort of stuff that would get that many people.'

However, as irony would have it triple j's Hottest 100, that hit the airwaves every Australia Day weekend, is the biggest music poll in the world.

Spencer has no doubt that triple j will be alive and well in another 40 years.

'It will out last us all.'
