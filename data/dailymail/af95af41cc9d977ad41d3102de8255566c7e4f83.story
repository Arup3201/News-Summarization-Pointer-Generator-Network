Channel 4 News has apologised after airing a clip of Robin Williams in the film Good Morning Vietnam saying 'Get a rope and hang me' in its coverage of the actor's death.

The programme broadcast a report about the 63-year-old'd death last night after he was found dead yesterday at his California home.

A preliminary coroner's report indicated the likely cause of death was suicide by asphyxiation.

The Channel 4 report included a clip from the 1987 film where Williams played an unorthodox DJ on US Armed Services Radio in Vietnam.

But the use of the quote was widely criticised on Twitter.

Voiceover artist Trish Bertram said: 'Slightly unfortunate choice of Robin William's Good Morning Vietnam clip by Channel 4 News for their closing tribute.'

While @Sophie 1983 tweeted: 'Did @Channel4News really use a clip from #GoodMorningVietnam where Robin Williams says "why don't they just get a rope and hang me" ?!?!?!?'

Ross Anderson posted: 'Unfortunate choice of #RobinWilliams clip from @Channel4News to end tonight's programme #c4news #GoodMorningVietnam.

Channel 4 later tweeted an apology after using the clip from Good Morning Vietnam in their coverage

They added that there was no offence intended and that their report was meant to be a heartfelt tribute

And Gary Ward said: 'Totally inappropriate clip to play from #channel4news with regards to Robin Williams passing.'

Channel 4 News later issued an apology and altered the tribute when it was broadcast an hour later on Channel 4+1. 

A spokesman said: 'We'd like to apologise for including what was an inappropriate line from Good Morning Vietnam in our play-out from tonight's programme.

'There was no offence intended in what was meant to be a heartfelt tribute to Robin Williams.'

It comes after Channel Seven in Australia came under fire for broadcasting a Family Guy episode featuring jokes about Robin Williams hours after it was revealed the actor had been found dead.

Digital channel 7Mate broadcast the ‘Big Man on Hippocampus’ episode some 14 hours after news broke that the Good Will Hunting actor had died, Mumbrella reported.

Family Guy episode 'Viewer Mail #2' featuring Robin Williams was broadcast on BBC Three, just as the news broke about the actor's death

A BBC spokesman said yesterday that the broadcast of the episode was an 'uncanny coincidence', but confirmed that a scheduled repeat of it for Friday will now not be shown

A Seven spokesperson told Mumbrella: 'It was a coincidence'.

Another Family Guy episode titled 'Viewer Mail #2' was also broadcast by the BBC which featured Williams - and suicide - just as news broke about his death.

But a BBC spokesman said: 'This was a repeat that we have shown a couple of times before, so who could have planned that?'

‘It was scheduled more than two weeks ago so it is just an uncanny coincidence. Some of our people who work here noticed that the death of Robin Williams was announced just as this episode ended.

‘It was due to be repeated on Friday but we will not be showing it now.’

Viewer Mail #2 is from season ten of the popular comedy, which looks at the life of an American family and is regularly shown on BBC Three.

Meanwhile TalkSPORT presenter also Alan Brazil provoked anger after saying he had 'no sympathy' for Robin Williams.

The radio host claimed the star's apparent suicide was selfish considering the effect it would have on his loved ones.

He said: 'I believe he’s got a daughter as well, what’s she feeling like this morning? Now she’s got to sort the arrangements out. I think it’s shocking, I really do.

'I don’t have a lot of sympathy, I’m sorry.'

But a spokesman for the station said: 'TalkSPORT would like to apologise for any offence caused. Alan’s comments do not reflect the views of the station.'

Williams, 63, was last seen alive by his wife Susan Schneider on Sunday night before she went to bed. He was found hanged in California at 11.45am local time on Monday.
