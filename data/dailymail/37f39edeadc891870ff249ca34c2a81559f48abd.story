Deceptive: Former Scotland Yard detective Ryan Coleman-Farrow failed to properly investigate 13 sex crimes

Eleven suspected sex attackers may never be brought to justice because a detective failed to investigate crimes properly.

Ryan Coleman-Farrow, 30, lied to rape victims that their cases had been dropped, avoided interviewing key witnesses, failed to get CCTV footage of attacks and did not send exhibits for forensic analysis.

The former Metropolitan Police officer bungled 13 cases in total, and yesterday pleaded guilty in court to 13 counts of misconduct in a public office.

The offences were carried out between January 2007 and September 2010, while Coleman-Farrow worked as a detective constable on Scotland Yard's Sapphire unit, which deals with investigations into rape and sexual assault.

He was sacked last year after an internal investigation.

Southwark Crown Court heard that Coleman-Farrow's misconduct related to 10 rape cases and three sexual assault inquiries.

Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC said that in 'almost all' of the 13 cases involved, no proceedings had resulted.

The investigations included 12 complainants and 11 suspects, he said.

Coleman-Farrow, from St Leonards-on-Sea, Hastings, East Sussex, was taken to court after an inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

The investigation followed complaints by a sex worker called Jaime Perlman, who claimed she was being stalked by a client in 2009 and was unhappy with the way Coleman-Farrow had handled the harassment allegations.

Miss Perlman later took her own life in an apparent suicide pact with another sex worker Riley Lison-Taylor, and no findings were made against Coleman-Farrow in relation to that case.

But the IPCC probe uncovered the officer's misconduct in other investigations.

IPCC deputy chairman Deborah Glass said: 'Ryan Coleman-Farrow was entrusted to investigate serious sexual offences and support some of the most vulnerable people in the criminal justice system.

'He let them down by his calculated abuse of their trust. His actions are beyond belief.

'After Mr Coleman-Farrow's initial criminal interview with the IPCC in November 2010, we submitted a file to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) to allow them to fast-track the misconduct process, and the MPS dismissed him in April 2011 while our investigation continued.'

Shame: Coleman-Farrow, who pleaded guilty to 13 counts of misconduct in a public office, walked with his head bowed outside court

She said that the force had reviewed all cases where Coleman-Farrow was in charge and that he was 'a rogue officer who set out to deceive'.

Ms Glass continued: 'The MPS have told us they reviewed all cases where Mr Coleman-Farrow was officer in charge and I understand that where cases required further or re-investigation this has been done.

'Our investigation did not reveal systemic or serious supervisory failings. While we may never fully understand the motivation for his actions, Mr Coleman-Farrow appears to have been a rogue officer who set out to deceive.

'While dealing with rogue individuals must always be a concern in any system, supervisory systems will not necessarily pick up on an officer who has concocted evidence to cover their tracks.

'In pleading guilty, Ryan Coleman-Farrow has at least spared some of his victims the burden of reliving their experiences, in court, of how their cases were, or were not investigated.'

The IPCC said that Coleman-Farrow had made false or misleading crime report entries 32 times, falsified a witness statement and twice claimed he had interviewed a rape suspect without actually doing so.

He also faked suspect accounts on three occasions, falsely claimed to have taken witness statements 15 times and said he had submitted files to the CPS without having done so seven times.

The Metropolitan Police said that after reviewing the 13 cases, 'no additional evidential or judicial opportunities were identified'.

Commander Peter Spindler said: 'We expect the highest standard of conduct from our officers, particularly within the Sapphire Command with its clear focus on victim care.

'This individual clearly fell well below those standards and it is therefore only right that he take full responsibility for his failings.

'His dismissal and subsequent criminal conviction sends a clear message to both the public and colleagues that neither the police service nor the courts will tolerate such serious professional failings.'

Judge Alistair McCreath granted Coleman-Farrow bail. The former officer is due to be sentenced next month.
