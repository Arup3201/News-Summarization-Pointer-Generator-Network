A pastor was left outraged after parts of a $12,500 bronze baptismal font went missing from his church sheltering Occupy Wall Street protesters.

Rev. Bob Brashear noticed before Sunday services that parts of the font at West Park Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, New York, had vanished.

‘It was like p*****g on the 99 per cent,’ he angrily told the 60 protesters who sleep at the church every night, according to the New York Post.

It comes after an occupier allegedly urinated on a cross at a church in Brooklyn, New York, also housing the economic and political protesters.

West Park’s Reverend Brashear saw that the 18-inch bronze basin and lid had gone from his font’s 800lb base, reported the New York Post.

The holy water from the River Jordan seemed to have been poured into the base’s bowl from the missing attachment.

He told the occupiers that they had 24 hours to find the missing parts, but later found the basin in a small room on the church’s premises.

However the lid is still missing - 
and this incident comes three weeks after a $2,400 MacBook vanished from
his office, reported the New York Post.

Reverend Brashear told the occupiers 
that when his 100-year-old church helped drug addicts in the 1980s, they
did not even touch the font.

He
has now given the occupiers - who have promised to reimburse him for 
the missing computer - two weeks to get out of the church.

Rabbi
Chaim Gruber, who was formerly part of the movement, claimed last week 
that a protester urinated on a cross in a Brooklyn church.

‘An occupier peed inside the building and the pee came into contact with a cross,’ he wrote, according to the New York Post.

Meanwhile it was revealed Occupy Wall Street protesters in San Francisco, California, allegedly hurled bricks and Bibles at police officers.

They had gained access to an abandoned hotel and began attacking police from the roof, injuring several officers, reported Fox News.
