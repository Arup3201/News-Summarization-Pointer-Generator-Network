The hipster moustache fad has taken off in recent years but this man has been growing his facial hair long before most of the trendy youngsters were born.

Paresh Hindocha from Leicester has been growing his moustache for 38 years and gets up half an hour early to style it with a dryer, hair spray and special styling glue.

The 56-year-old was inspired to start growing it as a teenager when a few of his friends started sporting the longer look, but he decided he never wanted to stop.

'Every morning I wash it properly,' he said. 'I use a hair dryer, hair spray and I even use special glue from the supermarket because I have to style it.

'I have never cut it off. It has been growing for 38 years. I plan to keep growing it for the rest of my life.'

Although Mr Hindocha  has never shaved off his moustache, he does trim it every week and said he gets stopped by people almost every time he leaves the house.

'Thousands of people take photographs of me. People say my moustache is very nice, it is brilliant,' he added. 

He carries around a picture of himself when he was 20 in his wallet to remind him what his moustache looked like then and to monitor its development.
