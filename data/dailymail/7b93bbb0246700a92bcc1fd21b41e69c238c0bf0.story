Sales of the iPhone 6 may have broken records globally but this was not the case in Australia.

The manufacturer of the smartphone, Apple, said it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6s in the first weekend of its September 19 launch, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

But this September's sales figures in Australia for Apple in-store and online fell short of meeting last year's in the same month by 300,000 units.

iPhone 6 sales broke records around the world but this was not the case in Australia

Data collated by Pocketbook showed Apple made more than 60 per cent of its annual revenue from its the selling of its gadgets in the first four months after a new product is released.

In December alone, spending on Apple devices is more than five times as much as any month from January to August.

Chief executive of the smartphone manufacturer Tim Cook said he was confident global sales of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus would have been higher if supply could meet demand, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Apple was also hit with a record number of pre-orders, amounting to four million on September 12 when the option became available.

According to Pocketbook, sales for Apple products fell in September this year compared to last year in the same month

The launch of the iPhone 6 in Australia - the first country to start selling the new products - saw thousands line up for hours to get their hands on the smartphones.

It also emerged many people who had lined up for days to be among the first in the world to buy the new iPhone 6 say they planned to sell them in China for triple the price they paid.

But the staggered release of the iPhone 6 meant it was not available in some countries - including the world's largest mobile market, China, where Apple is yet to announce a release date.

The basic model iPhone 6 16GB sells for $869 in Australia.

It had appeared on Chinese e-commerce sites, such as sea.taobao.com - where it is selling for 12,000 renminbi, or around $2,175,00.

Customers outside Apple's flagship store in Sydney told Daily Mail Australia on September 19 Chinese buyers are paying up to three times the retail price for the top of the line model iPhone 6 Plus 128GB - just 50 were released at the George Street Apple store.
