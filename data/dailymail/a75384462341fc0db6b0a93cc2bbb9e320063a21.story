Almost 2,000 women being treated in NHS hospitals in England were reported to have been subject to FGM since April (file picture)

Hundreds of women in England are being recorded as victims of female genital mutilation every month, a landmark report indicates.

In April this year, hospitals in England were told to start recording cases of female genital mutilation (FGM) they identified.

The figures today are from the first batch of statistics collated and released today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre.

They show that in the last six months, 1,746 cases of the crime were identified in English hospitals. 

In September alone, there were 467 new cases where women had been subjected to FGM. 

This adds to a further 1,279 cases of women who already been identified by the NHS in the five months previously as having been subjected to FGM. 

However it is feared the figures could simply be the 'tip of the iceberg', with the practice a largely 'hidden crime' . 

The NSPCC described the figure as 'shocking'. 

Head of Child Protection Operations John Cameron told MailOnline: 'These figures prove that FGM is very much a live public health issue.

'This NHS data shows just how vital it is that health professionals are trained to spot the signs of FGM so we can ensure that women and girls who are subjected to this brutal practice get the post-traumatic support they deserve. 

'We also need to make sure that information is shared amongst agencies when a victim is being treated for FGM so that other girls in the same family can be supported and protected.

'We need anyone who is worried about the thousands of women and girls in the UK who are vulnerable to FGM to call our helpline on 0800 028 3550. 

'It doesn't matter if you're uncertain, we're here to talk things through and offer advice and you may in turn stop a child from being subjected to this barbaric practice.'

Earlier this year Home Secretary Theresa May said that in the UK, more than 100,000 women are living with the consequences of FGM and a 60,000 are at risk.

The figures she cited, from a report from City University London in collaboration with Equality Now, estimated that 10,000 girls aged under 15 who migrated to England and Wales are likely to have undergone FGM. 

In July, the Government launched a £1.4 million programme to tackle FGM, with the aim of ending the practice within a generation.

This included bringing in laws to prosecute parents if they fail to prevent their daughters being cut.

It also requires collecting data about FGM in hospitals in England and training both health professionals and police officers to respond appropriately to cases of FGM.

Female genital mutilation is the practice in which some or all of the female genitals are removed, typically with a blade or a razor and sometimes without anaesthesia.

This includes removing the clitoral and the fold of skin above it, and removing labia – the inner 'lips' of the vagina.

This includes removing the clitoral and the fold of skin above it, and removing labia – the inner 'lips' of the vagina.

In the most severe form, the inner and outer labia are removed and the opening of the vagina is closed with a small hole so the woman can pass urine and menstrual blood.

Sometimes the vagina is then cut open for sex or childbirth.

Women sometimes bleed to death or can be left with horrifying health effects, such as infections, chronic pain, cysts, infertility and problems giving birth.

FGM has been a crime in the UK for 30 years, but there have been no convictions for the practice.

The first trial, in which two men are alleged to have performed the procedure on a woman after she gave birth, will take place in January.

HSCIC chair Kingsley Manning said: 'This is the first national collection of NHS data about numbers of FGM cases and we will continue to collect and publish these figures.

'Having accurate data about this crime is an important step in helping prevent its occurrence in the future. 

'The information will support the Department of Health in their FGM prevention programme, and we hope to expand the dataset over time so that it provides a more complete picture across a wider variety of care settings.'
