Stalker: Jason Smith, pictured leaving a different trial in 2010, admitted harassing two women

A stalker who pursued a six-year campaign of threats and intimidation against women he found online will be detained in a psychiatric hospital after admitting harassment.

Jason Smith, 28, was arrested after terrorising women whom he bombarded with text messages, phonecalls and threats of violence.

A hearing at Manchester Crown Court was told that Smith - whom prosecutors say suffers from mental illness - sent incessant messages to a 21-year-old Sarah Brett, whom he had never met face-to-face.

In one incoherent message he appeared to threaten the sleeping woman with throwing bricks through her window as punishment for upsetting him.

It said: 'Bricks going to go through your window in about two minutes, if you don’t wake up going to smash - watch, you f****d my head up.' [sic]

Another said: 'I’m going to smash in your head myself and going to love it'.

He later sent similarly demanding messages to one of her friends.

Smith wrote: 'Anwer ya phone now', followed by 'Am gonna slap ya fat wrinkly mum... an smash her car up if Sarah doesn't ring tonight.' [sic]

He also created fake Facebook accounts in Miss Brett's name and posted spiteful updates about her mother.

Smith would call as often as 300 times a day and sent her more than 200 threatening texts, the court heard.

When she refused to meet, ignored his calls and changed her phone number, Smith instead began pursuing her friend.

He threatened Beth O'Connor, also 21, with rape and said he would kill her family when she didn't help him track down Miss Brett.

Smith, who has similar previous 
convictions, was detained under the Mental Health Act and is expected to
 be taken to a psychiatric hospital.

During the trial it emerged that Smith, a musician, had 
previously been convicted of hounding a third woman between 2007 and 
2009.

Deluded: Prosecutors said Smith, pictured last year, convinced himself he was in a relationship with Miss Brett

He sent her as many as 30 threatening messages a day over Facebook and 
MySpace after she rejected her advances. He vowed to slash the victim’s face, rape her aunt and mother and shoot her father.

The
 court heard how Smith first contacted Miss Brett over dating site 
Plenty of Fish, and later sent her a friend request on Facebook and 
exchanged numbers with her.

They
 had once planned to meet, but Miss Brett changed her mind. However, 
Smith had already convinced himself that she was in love with him, and 
began sending huge numbers of intimidating messages, the court heard.

Prosecutor Holly Holden said: 'Although
 she didn’t actually meet him they did make a vague arrangement to meet 
but she changed her mind. She accepted him as a friend on Facebook as 
she didn’t see any reason not to.

'But
 on his Facebook she noted that he only had one female friend.

'They 
exchanged telephone numbers but he told her how he had lost money 
gambling and was reassuring himself that she was not seeing anyone.

'She found it worrying as they were not in a relationship. She said she found it quite creepy. He phoned her 300 times a day.

'Sometimes she would go to bed and wake to hundreds of calls by him from his mobile and landline.

'Her
 mobile phone would ring constantly, her male friends would sometimes 
answer to try and ward him off. Sometimes she would reply to the 
messages to say they were not in a relationship.

'She thought he was deluded to think they were in a relationship.'

Miss Brett called police but decided not to make a statement at first for fear of 'burdening' her family.

She changed her number after Smith sent her 236 threatening text messages.

After
 this Smith began to text 
Miss O'Connor.

Initially he called asking after Miss Brett, and later texted saying: ‘let me do yah Sarah’.

When Beth said: ‘It’s
 not Sarah’, he replied: ‘I know it’s Beth, Sarah is in London’. He said
 if she didn’t get Sarah to call him he would keep texting. He sent 184 
messages and called 200 times.

Erotomania, the disorder which it was claimed Jason Smith suffers, is a condition that causes a person to hold the delusional belief that someone is in love with them.

The disease, also known as de Clerambault's syndrome, is the subject of Ian McEwan's novel Enduring Love, which was made into a successful film starring Daniel Craig.

The conditions is said to inspire alternating periods of hope and resentment of the person.

It is often directed at celebrities, or people the sufferer has hardly met and can lead to hopeless campaigns in which the sufferer attempts to make contact.

Sufferers often convince themselves that the subject of their delusion is in love with them but unable to reveal their affections for practical or social reasons.

However the condition can be difficult to diagnose with certainty, requiring months of observation.

Later
 Smith sent Beth a message saying ‘I’m going to get someone to do ya - 
answer your phone now’. One message said: ‘I love Sarah and she loves 
me’.

In a victim impact statement Miss Brett said: 'Being on the receiving end of this is ruining my life and I live constantly in fear that he is going to cause me some harm.

'Someone fitting his description has been asking about me in bars and the thought of this terrifies me.'

A separate statement from Miss O'Connor said: 'I think he is dangerous man who is 
capable of anything. He said he was going to rape me and if he didn’t, 
someone else was going to do it instead.'

'After
 what happened, I’ve even been terrified to walk down the road and I am 
constantly looking over my shoulder because I think he is there lurking 
nearby.

'He’s even been walking around our neighbourhood with a picture of me. He was talking about bringing a gun and shooting me.

'This man is not safe to be around women. He was obsessed - this man should be in prison.'

Smith admitted harassment last Friday and was 
given a 28 day interim hospital order after Judge Andrew Blake was told a
 bed had become available at Prestwich psychiatric hospital.

In the hearing it had been claimed Smith suffered from erotomania - the delusion that another person is in love with them.

As he was led away he shouted from the dock: 'Put it in the news, put it on Youtube, tell your boss, this is going to be shocking, just you wait.'

At
 an earlier hearing defence lawyer Ben Lawrence argued there was an 
‘unusual’ background and added 'It does seem there’s some underlying 
psychiatric condition causing this offending.'

The
 court heard Smith had previously received a suspended jail sentence in 
2009 and then a community order when he offended again.
