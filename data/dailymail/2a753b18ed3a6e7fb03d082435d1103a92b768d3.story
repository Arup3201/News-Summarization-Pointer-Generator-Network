Footage obtained by The Mail on Sunday appears to show the moment Michaella McCollum Connolly and Melissa Reid left their hotel with the drugs for the airport in Peru.

The CCTV images show two women taking bags from the hotel and putting them into a taxi, while being minded by two men.

The video was recorded on August 6 at about 6am, just hours before Miss McCollum and Miss Reid were arrested at Lima airport.

Crucial: This unseen footage shows two women accompanied by two men, carrying suitcases from their hotel to a waiting taxi. Police say this image could be pivotal to the outcome of the case

Questioning: The never-before-seen footage is revealed as Melissa Reid (left) and Michaela Connolly's (right) full statements have been published by the Mail on Sunday

Whereabouts: The black and white footage shows the women move their bags at 6am on the morning they were arrested. It is thought they were moving luggage into the taxi which brought them to Lima airport

The Mail on Sunday obtained the footage from a street camera run by Lima’s neighbourhood watch service.

A
 source for the city’s prosecution team said: ‘This video could prove to
 be hugely important. We will examine it carefully and try to track the 
figures keeping an eye on the girls as they load up the taxi.’

Following
 the women’s arrest, police seized footage from the Hotel Colonial San 
Agustin, where they were staying but overlooked this street camera 
video.

The unseen footage comes a week after the Mail on Sunday obtained video that is thought to show Michaella McCollum Connolly taking 11kg of cocaine to her hotel.

Wearing
 a long black skirt and with her black hair tied up, the CCTV footage 
shows a woman walking back from a pizza parlour carrying a large bag.

The
 footage was recorded on August 5 at midday – 18 hours before the women 
are thought to be seen moving their suitcases from their hotel to a 
taxi.

The grainy pictures 
have been revealed nearly three weeks after Michaella McCollum Connolly 
and Melissa Reid were caught carrying £1.5 million of cocaine.

Holiday: The girls, pictured in Ibiza, were working in bars on the party island before they travelled to Peru

Collection: This CCTV footage, released last week, allegedly shows Michaella walking walking back to the hotel after collecting the drugs

Accused of trafficking drugs out of Peru, the two women, both 20, face sentences of up to 15 years.

In the meantime, they are already experiencing the harsh realities of a Peruvian prison, awaiting trial.

Ten
 days after their arrest, the two young women each spent nearly eight 
hours at the Dirandro police station in Lima making statements.

In
 them, they chronicled all they say happened from leaving Britain in 
June, full of youthful expectation about a working holiday in Ibiza, to 
the moment they were arrested in South America.

The
 statements were made separately before the chief prosecutor, the police
 officer in charge of the case, the women’s lawyers and members of their
 families.

In a police 
interview, the women said that they were called on a Blackberry phone 
given to them by men in Ibiza and told to go to the pizza parlour next 
to the hotel.

After this 
newspaper handed the footage of the 20-year-old carrying a bag from the 
pizza parlour to the city’s prosecutors yesterday they said it could 
form an important part of their case.

A source said: ‘This video could prove to be hugely important in the girls’ case.

‘We
 will examine it carefully and try to track the movements of the figures
 who are keeping an eye on the girls as they load up the taxi.’

Police have already seized CCTV footage from the Colonial San Agustin hotel.

But it appears they overlooked the video shot from the street camera outside the hotel.

Conditions: The women face spending up to three years in the notorious Fatima de Virgen prison where according to former inmates, bullying and prostitution is rife
