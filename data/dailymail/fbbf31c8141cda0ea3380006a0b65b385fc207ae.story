A mother and her two young children were killed and a 31-year-old family friend was arrested on suspicion of murder after the woman's teenage daughter fled their home Sunday night and called police to report a sexual assault in Canon City, Colorado.

The victims included a 5-year-old boy, a 9-year-old girl and their 35-year-old mother.

Police Sgt. Shannon Byerly said Monday that Jaacob Vanwinkle is facing charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and sexual assault. He was arrested at the home where the bodies were found. Vanwinkle appeared in court Monday and was denied bond.

Police were responding to a report of a sexual assault from the 15-year-old girl when they found the bodies. Byerly said the girl had been raped. She escaped and ran to a neighbor's home to notify police.

'This is a very, very tragic event. It's a very, very horrific crime,' said police Chief Paul Schultz.

The girl was taken to a hospital, where she was treated and released. None of the victims has been identified.

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation has been called in to help with the crime scene.

The three victims have not yet been identified as police work to notify their next of kin.

This isn't the first time Vanwinkle has been tied to a suspicious death.

In September 2011, Vanwinkle was arrested by police in Johnson County, Indiana when his 50-year-old roommate Michael Eaton was found dead at the residence their shared together, the Denver Westword revealed.

Police found Eaton's body buried debris in a bedroom at the shared residence, and arrested Vanwinkle soon after hiding out in the woods.

At the time, Vanwinkle told authorities that he didn't kill his roommate but did admit to moving the body and covering it with clothes and blankets.

Vanwinkle surrendered peacefully to police when they found him in the woods. He was also wanted on a parole violation.

It's uncertain whether Vanwinkle ever served time in the Eaton case, but public records show that he was in prison as recently as 2012. His most recent release day was May 30, 2012.

Vanwinkle somehow made it out to Colorado where he is listed in the state sex offender registry.

Public records show he was convicted of child molestation in 2004, and theft in 2010.
