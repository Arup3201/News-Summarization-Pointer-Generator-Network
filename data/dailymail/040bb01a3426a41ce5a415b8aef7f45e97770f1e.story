A man who wandered drunkenly into a shipping crate thinking it was his hotel woke up to find he'd been sealed in ready for a two-week journey to Los Angeles.

Jiang Wu had been enjoying a night out in Qingdao, Shandong province, when he thought it was time to return to his B&B for the night.

After one too many, he staggered into what he believed to be his lodgings and fell fast asleep, only to wake up the next day and realise his mistake.

Mr Wu was discovered in a sealed crate stacked 60ft in the air ready for a two-week container trip to the U.S.

Mr Wu had walked into one of thousands of identical 60ft-long metal crates, all of which had been sealed while he slept ready for loading onto a container ship.

One hour before the ship was due to sail on a two-week, 11,000-mile trip across the Pacific, and no doubt nursing a hangover, Mr Wu pulled out his telephone and rang everyone he knew, as well as the police, to ask for help in getting out.

A police spokesman said: 'The container was sealed and he couldn't get out so he called everyone he knew for help and called us too.

'His problem was, though, that he couldn't tell us which container he was in and there were thousands of them stacked on top of each other.'

Eventually Mr Wu was tracked down to a container stacked 60ft in the air by hammering on its metal side as people searched the docks.

A dock worker said: 'He's very lucky. If he'd been asleep for another hour the next stop would have been America.'
