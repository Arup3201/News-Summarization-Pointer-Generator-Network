A devoutly Christian player for the NFL has made his views known on allowing gays to play American Football, just weeks before the League is about to introduce its first openly gay player.

Kirk Cousins, quarterback for the Washington Redskins made some unfortunate comments when asked about the appointment of gay footballer Michael Sam, who will likely be drafted in May.

“There are a lot of teammates in my locker room right now who may not have a homosexual lifestyle, but they have sins, too. So I don’t say they can’t help us win. Nobody’s perfect,' said Cousins.

Conflicting views: Washington backup quarterback Kirk Cousins said Friday that he'd welcome a gay teammate into the locker room but then said 'nobody's perfect'

What does he really think? Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins says he'd welcome an openly gay teammate, but some are questioning the sincerity of his remarks

He went on: 'To that degree, we'd welcome them into our locker room and say come help us win, and hopefully I can love him like Jesus and hopefully show him what it means to follow Jesus.'

Cousins was also asked about having a gay teammate in a May 2013 interview with MLive, shortly after NBA player Jason Collins had come out.

At the time, Cousins called it a 'very, very sensitive issue' and that he hadn’t given it a lot of thought.

Cousins' comments came just weeks after former Missouri defensive lineman Michael Sam came out as gay in interviews with The New York Times and ESPN.

Although there may well be plenty of homophobic comments in the locker room, it appears many players have not yet learned to keep their thoughts to themselves.

Sam publicly came out following the college football season.

Change: The National Football League said it plans to increase efforts to promote tolerance of sexual orientation inside locker rooms in wake of Missouri defensive lineman Michael Sam¿s announcement that he is gay. Sam is expected to become the first openly gay player in the league¿s 94-year history this season.

Although his Missouri teammates knew of his sexuality during the fall, a public debate has been raging  concerning gay athletes in locker rooms, particularly in the NFL.

It's not just Cousins who has aired such views, earlier this week, it was reported an anonymous Redskins player said, 'I think some guys would kind of shy away from him a little bit' if they had a gay teammate, 'but for the most part, he’d be accepted.'

Outsports' Jim Buzinski was among those who were critical of Cousins' statements. 'People like Cousins seem well-meaning and he would like to think he's only full of love,' he wrote. 'But his assumption that homosexuality equals

imperfection and sin is insulting, as is his desire to proselytize.'

Cousins: 'From a football standpoint, if the guy can help us win, come help us win,' Cousins, a devout Christian, said. 'Now, there are a lot of teammates in my locker room right now who may not have a homosexual lifestyle, but they have sins, too. They¿re not perfect. So I don¿t say they can¿t help us win. Nobody¿s perfect.'

Cousins, who made his comments during an appearance at Michigan¿s North Pointe High School, went on to say: 'To that degree, we¿d welcome him into our locker room and say come help us win, and hopefully I can love him like Jesus and hopefully show him what it means to follow Jesus.'

The National Football League said it plans to increase efforts to promote tolerance of sexual orientation inside locker rooms.

Discussions of sexual orientation are not unheard of in NFL locker rooms and it is an accepted fact among players that there are already gay men in the league, according to a veteran.

One player said he previously played alongside a gay teammate in high school and that it was a non-issue.

'We all knew, but he was just one of the guys,' the player said to CBS Sports. 'From what I remember, nobody gave him any crap about it.'

Kirk Cousins: Last week, CBS cited an anonymous player who said that he could think of a handful of Redskins players who might have a difficult time with an openly gay teammate
