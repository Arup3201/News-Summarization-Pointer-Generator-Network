Laporshia Massey, 12, died of an asthma attack on Sept.25
after staff members at Bryant Elementary School in Cobbs Creek, PA didn’t provide immediate
rescue.

The school only has a nurse on staff two days a week. This
is due to Philadelphia budget cuts in schools implemented by Gov. Tom Corbett.

Daniel Burch, Laporshia’s father, is outraged. He says he received
a call from the school saying that his daughter felt sick but assumed she was
with a nurse. He told his daughter he would take care of her when she got
home.

Burch’s fianceé, Sherri Mitchell also received a call from
the school and says that volunteers at the school told Mitchell that the girl said
she couldn’t breathe.

“Why didn’t [the school] take her to the hospital?’ asked
Laporshia’s father. He believes that a qualified nurse would have recognized
Laporshia’s illness as an emergency.

After the first budget and staffing cuts, one nurse warned
the school that teachers were not qualified to help asthmatic students in her
absence.

‘Without the school nurse, at a minimum, persistent errors
in judgment will result in a child getting a substandard education,’ says
school nurse Eileen Duffey. ‘In worst-case scenarios, life-threatening
conditions may surface while a child is in school and go unnoticed.’

According to Philadelphia School District Rules school staff
members ‘must act promptly to provide immediate care.’  A source for the district believes, ‘if they
had called rescue, she would still be here today.’

At the end of the school day a staff member drove Laporshia
home at 3:15. Burch immediately recognized that his daughter needed immediate
care after she ran up her stairs to grab her nebulizer machine.

Burch drove his daughter to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
where she died later that afternoon.

According to The Washington Post, School's don't only lack nurses, they lack administrative staff to deal with a crisis. They are also dissuaded from calling 911 in most situations.

Pennsylvania Department of Health spokesperson Holli Senior
told City Paper that she offered assistance in going over Laporshia’s death to help the school recognize critical errors. They recommend this ‘in certain situations to
ensure that they did what they were supposed to do, in the order that they were
supposed to do it.’

The school told Senior that they didn’t want any assistance
or the health department to get involved.

Hundreds of parents have filed complaints regarding the
shortage of qualified health
professionals in schools due to budget cuts.
