Gary Lineker's BBC future is in doubt amid claims he is interested in quitting to move to BT.

The Match of the Day host is considering jumping ship to broadcaster BT to front its new sports channel.

Earlier this year, the phone company won live rights to 38 Premier League games a year from 2013 after paying £738million.

On the move? Gary Lineker, pictured presenting the Euro 2012 final last night,  is considering leaving the BBC for BT's new sports channel

It now wants a big name presenter to front the channel and has set aside 'serious money' to pay for the right person.

A BT spokesman told MailOnline the company was looking for 'top talent' and said it had been approached by many agents on behalf of their clients - although nothing had been decided yet.

Representatives of Lineker have been in touch with the company to voice an interest in the role on his behalf.

The BT spokesman said: 'He's not anymore of a candidate than anyone else. We haven't had any meetings and we haven't spoken to anyone.'

However, he added: 'We are looking for serious talent to front the programme. Of course Gary is the Match of the Day presenter, he's got pedigree and stature.'

Rumours surrounding a possible BBC 
exit come as the 51-year-old former England and Spurs player is facing a
pay cut to his £2million-a-year salary.

MOTD pundit Alan Hanson has already taken a £500,000 pay-cut and Lineker is expected to do the same as part of the BBC's economy drive.

His contract is also due to expire in August next year leaving the door open for a possible move.

At the moment, the Surrey-based 
presenter, who is also fronting the London 2012 Olympic Games, has to 
travel to the new BBC studios in Salford, Manchester where Match of the 
Day is filmed.

Last month, the Premier League cashed
in with a new £3.018billion deal which splits domestic broadcast rights
between BSkyB and BT.

The phenomenal deal for 2013-16 is a 
massive £1.254billion - 70 per cent - increase on the current deal, 
which is shared between Sky and U.S.-based sports network ESPN.

BT said at the time it would launch a new football-focused channel to broadcast its share of the matches.

The telecoms company said in a statement: 'It will offer new interactive features when supplied over BT’s fibre 
network and we will look to distribute it on other platforms'.

The BBC told Daily Mirror that it never comments on individual contracts.
