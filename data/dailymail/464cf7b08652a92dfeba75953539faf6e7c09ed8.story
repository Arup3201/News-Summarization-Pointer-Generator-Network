Romantic stories of men gallantly throwing their coats over puddles of water to spare their beloved's feet from getting wet are not just medieval fairy tales.

When modern-day teenagers are in love, they'll also do anything to prove how much they really care.

So when this young Mexican couple - dubbed 'Romeo and Julieta' by their friends - gets caught in the pouring rain, the boyfriend takes his queue to prove himself as a 'real man'.

He scoops up his girlfriend and carries her in his arms, wading through deep flooding water to bring her to safety.

But before he manages to find dry ground, an invisible hole under the water swallows them whole!

Luckily, it was all caught on camera by their snickering friends.

Who said chivalry was dead, eh?

Com'on baby, I'll save you: 'Romeo' scoops up his girlfriend, 'Julieta', to carry her across the deep water

Danger ahead: Romeo thinks he is walking to safety, but...

Whoops!: A hole under the water appears out of nowhere

Going, going...

Gone!: The pair get swallowed whole by the hole and disappear under the water

In shock: The couple emerge from under the water

Soaking wet: Romeo steps out of the hole carrying his dripping backpack

Helping hand: Romeo takes his Julieta's hand to pull her out of the hole

Quick check: The couple regroup to see if either of them were hurt in the fall

Follow me: Julieta grabs Romeo's hand and takes the lead

I could've sworn...: A baffled Romeo looks back at the invisible hole that just swallowed him and his girlfriend.
