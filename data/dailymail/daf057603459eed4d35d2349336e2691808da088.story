Former Liverpool and Manchester City winger Albert Riera has denied he was sacked by Serie A club Udinese after skipping a match to play in a poker tournament.

Riera spent two years at Anfield after joining Rafa Benitez's Liverpool from Espanyol for £8million in 2008, having had an unsuccessful loan spell at the Etihad two years earlier.

The 32-year-old signed for Udinese from Galatasaray in March but has been allowed to leave after being accused of skipping their game against Chievo on November 23 to play poker in Slovenia, where he won £3,000 for finishing second.

The 32-year-old's time in the Premier League certainly wasn't ace as he was held to just four goals in 55 appearances.

Udinese announced Riera's departure on Thursday on their official website.

'Udinese Calcio announces that the contract with the footballer Albert Ortega Riera has been terminated by mutual consent,' they wrote.

'Udinese Calcio wishes the footballer all the best for his future career.'

But Riera has insisted it has nothing to do with his poker exploits or for reasons off the pitch.

'To clarify, the termination of the contract (is) by mutual agreement, not due to reasons outside the football,' Riera tweeted following claims made by the Daily Mirror.

Riera joined Watford on loan until the end of the season three days after signing a pre-contract for Udinese on March 24.

He made eight appearances in the Championship, scoring once, but the former Spain international failed to make a single appearance for Udinese.

Riera, now a free agent and looking for a club, has posted photographs on Twitter of him playing poker with friends and team-mates. Udinese have been contacted for a response.

Riera previously tweeted this photograph of him playing poker with his team-mates between training sessions
