Prince William, pictured in his RAF flying gear is to announce he will become a helicopter pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance

Nine months after he gave up his wings as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot, Prince William has been lured back to a flying job.

The Duke of Cambridge will announce he is to become a helicopter pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance service rather than taking a full-time Royal role.

He and Kate are planning to base themselves at Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham Estate, which lies midway between the air ambulance service bases at Norwich and Cambridge. The move will enable William to see Prince George on a regular basis.

He is likely to be one of six pilots, mainly from military backgrounds, who fly the ambulance service’s  two yellow twin-engine EC 135 T2 helicopters, which can reach 135 knots (150mph). They can get to anywhere in the counties of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk in 25 minutes.

All are employed by Bond Air Services, with salaries ranging  from £40,000 to £60,000, but it is not known if William will be paid. Work is on a rota of five days on, three  days off, for 365 days a year.

As the only air ambulance service in the country with night vision technology, William will expect to fly at night as well as daytime, working ten-hour shifts.

However, when he is on official engagements, the Prince will travel in a more luxurious manner: the Queen is leasing an £8million Agusta Westland A109S helicopter to fly members of the Royal Family on official engagements. The money will be paid for out of the Sovereign Grant.

The aircraft, which bears the Royal crest, has leather seats and a top speed of 180mph. It will be available to all the Royals – but as William and Kate step up their official engagements, they are likely to spend most time on board.

William has made no secret of the fact that he misses flying since he left his post at RAF Valley on Anglesey last September, where he flew a Sea King helicopter.

In a BBC documentary last year he spoke of his pride in the job. ‘I don’t think there’s any greater calling in life,’ he said.

Since then he has been taking what aides describe as ‘a transitional year’, attending a ten-week land management course at Cambridge University and launching his United for Wildlife charity.

But he has admitted he was itching to get back in the cockpit.

During a trip to an aviation museum, on his recent tour of New Zealand, he said that the historic military aircraft made him ‘long to be flying again’ and revealed he was hoping to get his commercial pilot’s licence as well as his military wings and private flying licence.

And, last month, he asked to meet the crew, staff and charity trustees of the Scottish Air Ambulance, making a beeline for their twin-engine Bolkow 105 helicopter parked on  the playing field of Strathearn Community College in Crieff.

The Duchess may have mixed feelings about her husband returning  to the cockpit. In the foreword to a book about RAF wives published last month, she wrote: ‘I loved my time in Anglesey when William was serving with RAF search-and-rescue.

'I cannot pretend I didn’t feel anxious at times when William was on shift in howling gales, but he loved doing it and I felt incredibly proud.’

The East Anglian Air Ambulance service, run as a charity, was launched by jockey Frankie Dettori in 2000 after he survived a plane crash.

A spokesman for Kensington Palace said the Duke had made it clear he was considering this option as part of his public service duties.

A spokesman for East Anglian Air Ambulance said: ‘We know that he  is considering his options but that is all we are aware of at this stage.'
