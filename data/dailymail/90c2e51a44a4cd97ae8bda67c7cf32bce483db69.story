Fresh from masterminding a stunning victory against Barcelona on Sunday, David Moyes was brought back down to earth as Real Sociedad were beaten by Villarreal at El Madrigal.

Russian midfielder Denis Cheryshev scored the only goal of the game less than 10 minutes after being introduced as a second-half substitute to earn a deserved victory for Villarreal in the Copa del Rey last-16.

The hosts were unbeaten in 11 games going into the clash and lived up to their favourites tag as they took a one-goal advantage into next week's second leg with a place in the quarter-finals up for grabs.

Sociedad produced a defensive performance full of the typical gusto associated with a Moyes side and looked for long periods as though they might escape with a hugely credible draw to take back to Anoeta.

But it wasn't to be. Cheryshev had only been on the pitch for nine minutes when he was played in down the left channel with such precision that the Russia international didn't even have to break stride.

He unleashed a fierce left-footed drive from a tight angle that arrowed across the Sociedad keeper before nestling in the bottom corner.
