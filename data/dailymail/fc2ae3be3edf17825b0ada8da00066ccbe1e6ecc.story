David Cameron today became the latest politician to be hit by the curse of local radio. 

The Prime Minister was reprimanded live on air after repeatedly referring to Tyneside while being interviewed on BBC Tees.

Broadcasting from London, Mr Cameron admitted he was confused about the area he was speaking to, before hastily trying to change the subject.

With less than a year to go until the general election, all party leaders are desperate to have airtime in every part of the country.

But doing a round of back-to-back local radio interviews seems to be most perilous way of trying to reach the electorate.

Today Mr Cameron annoyed presenter Lisa McCormick by repeatedly referring to examples of how the economy was flourishing on Tyneside.

Eventually she snapped: 'You keep mentioning the River Tyne. That's not our region Prime Minister. I'm sorry, we are the River Tees.'

Sounding distinctly flustered, Mr Cameron replied: 'I'm sorry, I thought I was doing....' before going on hastily to point out that the Government was investing £90 million in the Tees Valley.

But that did nothing to placate Ms McCormick who pointed out that it was pouring £470 million into Greater Manchester and £440 million into the South East.

'Ninety million pounds seems like a drop in the ocean to me,' she said.

Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland said Mr Cameron is 'out of touch' and disinterested in Teesside.

He said: 'Over the last four years of David Cameron we've had a Tory peer calling the region 'desolate', frequent misspellings of Teesside in official Number 10 letters and now the Prime Minister himself can't even take the basic cue of appearing on BBC Tees to get the hint that our river is the Tees and not the Tyne.

'This just highlights how David Cameron is out of touch with the region and completely disinterested in places like Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar, Hartlepool and East Cleveland.'

However, Labour politicians are not immune to the pitfalls of local radio.

Earlier this month shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna faced ridicule after mis-pronounced Worcester.

As he took to the local airwaves to promote Labour’s latest policy, he bizarrely referred to people on the streets of Wichita, a city in Kansas 4,400 miles away.

Before May’s local elections, Labour leader Ed Miliband was also caught out during an interview on BBC Radio Wiltshire.

Ben Prater, the interviewer, asked him what he made of ‘Jim Grant’ without saying who he was.

Mr Miliband asked him to repeat the question but then admitted he had no idea who he was talking about, and asked the presenter to ‘enlighten’ him.

In a toe-curling exchange, Mr Prater told him Mr Grant was the Labour leader on Swindon council. Mr Miliband then blundered again by referring to Mr Grant as the leader of Swindon council, when in fact the council is controlled by Conservatives.

Flailing, Mr Miliband said: ‘I think he is doing a good job for Labour on the council.’
