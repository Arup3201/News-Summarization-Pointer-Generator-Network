Basketball great Michael Jordan has bought another sprawling multi-million dollar estate, this time in his home state of North Carolina.

The NBA Hall of Famer is best known for his time with the Chicago Bulls, the basketball team he joined after dazzling with the University of North Carolina in the early Eighties.

He spent most of his childhood in North Carolina, played for the North Carolina Tar Heels and is now the majority owner of the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats.

The property Michael Jordan has bought is just 22 miles from where the team he owns, the Bobcats, play

So it makes sense that the Brooklyn-born star, who turned 50 earlier this month, should own a home there as well.

According to Fox Sports, Jordan recently paid $2.8million for a home in Cornelius, North Carolina, just 22 miles from where the Bobcats play.

And Jordan snagged the home at a significant deal.

Originally listed for $3.99million in 2011, the bank foreclosed on the home in August 2012, and it later was re-listed for $3.49million.

'It's fantastic. He got a great buy on that house,' said Cornelius Commissioner Dave Gilroy told the Charlotte Observer.

Drag racer Doug Herbert, who previously lived in the home, said the property 'is a great place to entertain friends and have people over.'

Herbert said he would love to chat 
with Jordan about the many fond memories he had at the home. But it was 
actually a tragic memory that ultimately encouraged him to move, he 
said.

Herbert's two sons, Jon, 17, and James, 12, were killed in a head-on traffic wreck in 2008, on Jetton Road near their home.

'It was a difficult trip to make everyday to go to work,' Herbert said. 'It became hard to live there. It was time to go.'

12,310 sq ft with six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a two-story great 
room that opens out to a terraced patio, which holds an enormous pool 
and spa.

An expansive basement holds room for a personal gym and entertainment center. Jordan already owns an extensive collection of real estate.

His custom estate in Chicago is currently on the market, and he bought a Jupiter, Florida, home on the Jack Nicklaus Signature Course last year.

He also owns a place in Salt Lake City and reportedly a condo in Charlotte.
