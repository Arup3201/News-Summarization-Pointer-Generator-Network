Andy Murray dramatically bowed out of the championship at Wimbledon today, and the agony of watching it was etched deep on the Duchess of Cambridge's face.

Sitting in the royal box at Centre Court, 32-year-old Kate grimaced with every point the 27-year-old reigning champion conceded in his quarter final clash against Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov, 23.

Earlier the Cambridges took their seats alongside Princess Beatrice and her long-term boyfriend, Dave Clark, comedian Michael McIntyre, and England rugby union coach, Stuart Lancaster.

Murray's match, which began with him losing the first two sets to the Bulgian 11th seed, came after Romania's Simona Halep defeated Germany's Sabine Lisicki n the ladies' quarter final match.

In the players' box, Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears, 26, was there to cheer him on, though there was no sign of Dimitrov's girlfriend, tennis player Maria Sharapova, 27, who suffered a shock defeat by Angelique Kerber yesterday.

Kate paid homage to the All England Club's strict dress code for players by wearing a white dress by Australian fashion brand Zimmermann.  She also wore the elegant knee-length outfit in Sydney during the Royal Tour in April.

Murray and Dimitrov know each other well and, on the eve of Wimbledon, Murray's fitness trainer Jez Green took part in a charity 200-metre race against Dimitrov's coach Roger Rasheed.

Their friendship even led to Murray grabbing a hair dryer and brush to assist with Dimitrov's hair cut during a tournament in Rome in May.

The 23-year-old Bulgarian was clearly pleased with the job, declaring it was 'beautiful', but the pair were both in a more serious frame of mind when their match began at 1.30pm.

However the friendly smiles quickly turned to angry grimaces, on Murray's part at least, as he dropped first one set, then another, and then another, losing to the Bulgarian in straight sets.

The home audience howled in despair as he dropped point after point and it became increasingly clear that the reigning champion was not going to hang on to his title.

Australian
 teenager Nick Kyrgios was also back on court today after beating world 
number one Rafael Nadal in a match even his own mother thought he would 
lose.

The 
19-year-old produced one of the greatest shocks in the tournament's 
history by defeating the Spaniard in four sets last night.

Wild-card entrant Kyrgios arrived at Wimbledon ranked 144th in the world, and will leave having reached at least number 65.

Princess Beatrice and boyfriend Dave Clark strolled to the royal box hand in hand ahead of an afternoon's tennis;  Sir Cliff Richard was also in SW19 to watch the action

The forecast for SW19 was dry and bright but Kate carried a bright red pashmina in case temperatures dropped later

He seemed surprised with how the match went, posting a message on Twitter which simply read: 'Erm, ok then...........'

Kyrgios wrote last week that he wanted 25,000 Twitter followers by the end of Wimbledon and he cracked the milestone mid-way through the match. He now has more than 59,000.

Meanwhile three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe was so impressed by Kyrgios's performance that he believes he could emulate Boris Becker by winning the title in his teens.

Come on Muzza!  But these Andy Murray fans were no help to him when he lost the first two sets of his match to Dimitrov

McEnroe, commentating at the tournament for the BBC, reckoned Kyrgios had the look of a champion about him as he demolished Nadal's title hopes.

'I could see it from the commentators' box, that he absolutely believed he was going to win this match, and he's acting to me like he can win this tournament,' McEnroe said.

'The last guy I saw like this is ... Boris Becker, that young teenager, no fear whatsoever - ‘no matter what comes my way I'm going to be better than them'.'Becker won Wimbledon in 1985 at the age of 17.
