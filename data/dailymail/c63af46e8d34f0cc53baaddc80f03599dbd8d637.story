A South Carolina couple facing murder charges for allegedly killing the husband's former 20-year-old mistress were each granted a $100,000 bond Friday after spending nearly a year in jail.

Tammy Moorer, 42, and her husband, 38-year-old Sidney Moorer, are accused of killing Heather Elvis, even though her body has never been found after her disappearance in December 2013.

The Moorers’ defense attorneys asked for another hearing because they said their investigation showed prosecutors didn't have as much evidence as they initially claimed.

Circuit Judge Markley Dennis decided to grant bond after stating that under the law they were innocent.

The judge also required the couple to wear GPS monitors and ordered them to stay at least 5 miles away from the home of the victim's parents. Both the suspects' families and the victims' families reported they have been repeatedly harassed and threatened on Facebook.

Tammy and Sidney Moorer are currently scheduled to stand trial in May.

The couple were transported back to jail after the bond hearing. Mrs Moorer had posted bond by Friday afternoon and was videotaped by WMBF leaving the detention facility at around 6pm.

Her husband remained behind bars because the paperwork required for his release had not been filed, according to ABC News 4.

A gag order has been issued in the case, leading to plenty of speculation, but not much information. Attorneys for the Moorers used the bond hearing to publicly attack the prosecution's case.

Love triangle: Sidney Moorer had an affair with Heather Elvis before she vanished in December 2013

The defense lawyers said authorities immediately locked on Sidney Moorer as a suspect because he had an affair with Elvis about two months before she went missing in December 2013.

Moorer also called Elvis from a pay phone about two hours before she disappeared, but his lawyer, Kirk Truslow, said it was simply to tell Elvis to stop bothering him after she kept calling and texting when he ended their brief relationship and reconciled with his wife.

Truslow said the only other evidence was a black truck seen on a surveillance camera driving to and from the boat ramp where Elvis' car was found around the time she disappeared.

The Moorers owned a black truck, but so do hundreds of other people in the area, and Truslow said prosecutors had no expert that could link the truck directly to them.

Prosecutor Nancy Livesay told the judge that authorities have substantial circumstantial evidence, including threats Tammy Moorer made on a Facebook page trying to get help finding Elvis after she disappeared and a number of nasty text messages she sent to Elvis.

Tammy Moorer's lawyer also criticized the investigation, saying authorities took Sidney Moorer's mention that he and his wife had sex in a car behind a warehouse to charge them with indecent exposure so police could get warrants to search everything they owned.

‘The arrest of them was designed to solve the case,’ defense attorney Greg McCollum said. ‘And if they had committed the crime, it might very well have worked.’

Heather Elvis's parents, Debbi and Terry Elvis, were present at the Charleston courtroom during the bond hearing Friday.

After hearing the judge’s decision, the parents said they were concerned for the safety of their younger daughter and appealed to the community to respect the authority of the court.  

Earlier this week, Heather's dad said he was frustrated that the focus was on the suspects' bond hearing rather than on locating his missing daughter.

‘It's like being in limbo, you can't grieve,’ his wife added in an interview with WMBF. ‘Heather's not here, so you can grieve that...there's no place to go.’

Heather Elvis, a cosmetology student, vanished on December 18 after she drove her car - willingly, authorities believe - to a boat landing building in Myrtle Beach. It was found empty on December 19.

Cell phone records show Sidney Moorer, 38, was in contact with Miss Elvis at 6am on the day she disappeared.

In the original police report, seen by WMBF News, Miss Elvis was said to have been in a relationship with Moorer, who she had met while working in a restaurant.

Her roommate had told police the affair had ended about a month before Miss Elvis disappeared, and that on the night she went missing, the pair were back in contact.

The roommate allegedly said Miss Elvis told her Moorer had called to say he was leaving his wife so he could be with her.

A December 19 police report included a statement from Sidney Moorer admitting he had been in contact with Miss Elvis, to tell her to 'quit calling him and that was it'.

On the night Miss Elvis disappeared, she had been on a date with a man who dropped her off at the apartment at about 2am. That man has been ruled out of the investigation.

Police believe Miss Elvis later drove herself to the boat landing where her car was found, although the reason she would go there is not known.
