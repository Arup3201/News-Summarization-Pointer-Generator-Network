A Michigan doctor who disappeared nearly a month ago had been stalking a well-known local gospel singer, and even referred to him as her 'husband', a local newspaper reports.

Dr Teleka Patrick, 30, had a personal protection order filed against her by pastor and gospel singer Marvin Sapp, 46, who said Dr Patrick had visited his home and contacted his young children to get close to him.

It is also indicated in the PPO that Dr Patrick, who started her residency at Borgess Medical Center in Kalamazoo, Michigan last year, moved to the area from California because of Pastor Sapp.

Dr Teleka Patrick, 30, who started her residency at Borgess Medical Center in Kalamazoo, Michigan last year, disappeared in early December

'She has moved from CA to MI,' Sapp wrote in part in the PPO request. 'Joined my church, contacts my children, and has been to my home.'

WOOD-TV reported that Pastor Sapp had filed the PPO order in September, and that he had 'over 400 page(s) of correspondence from her to which I have never responded.'

He added that Patrickâ€™s stalking had gone on for at least a year prior to her moving to Michigan.

The young doctor was reported missing when she did not show up for work on December 6.

Surveillance footage showed her the night before failing to secure a room at a Radisson hotel just five minutes away from her apartment.

According to police, Dr Patrick worked a shift at Borgess on December 5 and had one of her colleagues drive her to the Radisson after work.

Both her purse and cellphone were found left behind at work, and surveillance footage at the hotel shows her trying to get a room with cash, but not having enough money.

In the footage, without 
audio, Dr Patrick talks calmly with the front desk clerk for about 15 
minutes before leaving after not getting the room.

She
 is then seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle back to her gold 
Lexus parked at the medical center - the last time anyone saw her.

It
 was really sad to watch it because this is the last video record of her
 before she went missing,' Teleka's sister Tenesha Patrick told WWMT.

Just two hours later, Dr Patrick's 
car was discovered abandoned in a ditch on the westbound side of 1-94, 
more than 100 miles away in Portage, Indiana.

The keys were missing from
 the inside of the car.

Why was she there? Dr Patrick's family doesn't know why she was trying to book a room. Investigators later found she left both her phone and purse at work

Dr Patrick was officially reported missing the next day when she failed to show up for work.

One of her colleagues told investigators that she received a phone call that day and that her demeanor changed after she hung up.

Dr Patrick's parents, who live in Florida, said she has a busy schedule but usually calls them once a week, usually on Sundays.

They did not believe that their daughter was in a romantic relationship.

Her family has now asked the investigator handling another famous missing persons case, Mary Land, who disappeared ten years ago, to help find her.

Dr Patrick's parents met with Jim Carlin of Justinian Investigative Services in Battle Creek and the agency will now work on her case.

Leaving: The last time Dr Patrick is caught on surveillance cameras, she is seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle which took her back to the medical center where her car was parked

Dr Patrick had started her first year of residency in Kalamazoo after graduating from medical school last spring

Close to home: The hotel is located just five minutes from Dr Patrick's apartment

Her mother Irene told CNN: 'She has an outgoing personality... she's a warm, friendly, lovely person to be around.'

She added that her daughter had just bought a plane ticket to fly to Florida.

'Who was calling her, what was that about, does that have anything to do with her disappearance?' her sister asked. 

Her
 family is currently offering a $10,000 reward for information on her 
disappearance, and have hired their own private investigator.

'We keep getting closer to Christmas, and it keeps getting further and further away,' Tenesha told ABC News.

Anyone with information on Dr Patrick's disappearance are being asked to call the Indiana State Police at 219-696-6242 or the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department at 269-383-8748.
