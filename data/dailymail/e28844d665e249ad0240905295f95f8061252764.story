Billionaire: Strolling through central London last month, Hans Rausing appeared to be responding well to his drug treatment programme

Billionaire Hans Rausing, wearing his late wife Eva's engagement and wedding rings around his neck on a cord, has made a rare public appearance a year after she was found dead in their £50million London mansion.

Last year a judge cited him as a tragic warning of the ‘utterly destructive’ effects of drug abuse, after he admitted hiding his crack addict wife’s 
body for two months while he carried out a desperate charade to convince
their servants she was alive.

Rausing, 49, cut a pathetic figure as he stood in the dock but strolling through central London, the Tetra Pak heir appeared to be responding well to his drug treatment programme which was imposed by the court.

Sporting a new bushy beard, he wore a black leather jacket, striped polo shirt and Fidel Castro style hat as he walked with the aid of a walking stick close to the private clinic where he is being helped to end his addiction.

It appeared an improvement from the last pictures of him in public with his wife, when he looked gaunt and confused as he stumbled through London close to the couple’s £70million mansion.

Days after those images were taken in May 2012, Rausing’s wife Eva died at the 50-room property in Cadogan Place, Belgravia.

But rather than inform police, Rausing banned staff from entering the couple’s squalid ‘crack den’ bedroom in their otherwise-immaculate home.

He said she was suffering a fever and he was taking her temperature three times a day.

In fact he was covering her rotting body with 12 layers of clothes, blankets and plastic sealed with industrial tape before covering it in deodorant to mask the smell.

Rausing hid her body for more than two months before he was stopped by police after driving erratically through morning rush hour traffic in Wandsworth, south London.

Police who searched his car found a crack pipe, cannabis and white powder in the footwell of his Bristol Coupe and noticed his pupils were dilated.

When they later raided his house, 48-year-old Mrs Rausing was so badly decomposed that she had to be identified from a fingerprint and the serial number on her heart pacemaker.

Rausing received a ten month suspended sentence on the condition that he agreed to a drug rehabilitation programme at a private clinic after he admitted the common law offence of failing to prevent his wife’s lawful and decent burial.

Isleworth Crown Court was told that the couple had struggled with drug abuse in their youth but had successfully fought it to form a ‘loving’ family.

But their fateful decision to raise a glass of champagne together to toast the new millennium on December 31 1999 sent them spiralling back into a devastating addiction that was to cost them everything.

Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson told Rausing as he sentenced him: ‘If ever there was an illustration of the utterly destructive effects of drug misuse on individuals and their families, it is to be found in the facts of this case.

‘You and your wife had every material advantage imaginable, and for a time a happy family life. Your relapse into the misuse of drugs, together with that of your wife, destroyed all that.’

Mr Rausing’s wealth comes from the world’s largest food packaging firm, Tetra Pak, which was founded in Sweden by his grandfather. Like several other members of the family, Mr Rausing settled in London.
