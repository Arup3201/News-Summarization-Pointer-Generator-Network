It is a complaint heard in living rooms across the country – that there is never anything new on the television.

And the BBC seems to be trying its hardest to prove it, with the schedule for BBC2 almost identical for two days in a row.

Both yesterday and today the channel had the same sequence of shows from lunchtime until late at night, including snooker, repeats of sitcom W1A and the quiz Eggheads.

Although the shows are from the same series, they are different episodes, so at least the content of each will be fresh.

When a series is shown day after day it is called stripping and is a well-known practice for soap operas and game shows. But it is far less common for documentaries, such as Great British Railway Journeys, Great British Garden Revival and Nature’s Weirdest Events, all of which BBC2 is showing on the two consecutive days.

The run of programmes starts with the Daily Politics, which discusses the political stories of the day with various guests. That is followed on both days by live coverage of The Masters snooker tournament and then by quiz Eggheads, presented by Jeremy Vine.

Then Michael Portillo presents Great British Railway Journeys, yesterday’s programme looking at London’s railways and today’s examining the impact of the Olympics. This is followed by a trio of documentaries: Great British Garden Revival, Nature’s Weirdest Events and What’s the Right Diet for You? A Horizon Special. These are followed by sitcom W1A and Newsnight before the channel moves to highlights of the snooker.

BBC2 has been criticised in the past for its lack of original programming. On December 27, it showed nothing but repeats between 7.30am and 7.30pm and then, between December 20, 2014, and January 2, 2015, 74 per cent of the channel’s programmes had been seen before. Last night a spokesman for BBC2 said: ‘The programmes highlighted are clearly all different parts of a series.’

The W1A sitcom, starring Hugh Bonneville and Sarah Parish, has been shown on BBC2 two days in a row

Quiz show Eggheads, hosted by Jeremy Vine, has also made the schedule two days in a row
