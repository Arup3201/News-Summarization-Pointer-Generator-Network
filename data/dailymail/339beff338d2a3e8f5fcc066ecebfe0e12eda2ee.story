Which would you rather win? The League Cup quarter-final? Or the derby?

Radio phone-ins, newspaper polls, Twitter squabbles – debate has raged all week on Tyneside.

The reality is, of course, Newcastle United, as is their wacky way, will probably either win both or lose both.

Alan Pardew's Newcastle face Tottenham in their Capital One Cup quarter-final on Wednesday night

The 1955 FA Cup, brought home to Newcastle here, is the last time the club won domestic silverware

But, for now, it provides a fascinating insight into the mindset of supporters often billed the country’s longest suffering (50,000 every week and no domestic trophy in 60 years is unique, you have to say).

On Wednesday night their team travel to Tottenham Hotspur in the last eight of the Capital One Cup. It is the first time they have been beyond the fourth round of a domestic cup competition during Alan Pardew’s four-year tenure. They are two ties from Wembley, a venue last visited in 2000 when, during an FA Cup semi-final, Sir Bobby Robson’s team were undone by a double from Chelsea’s Gus Poyet.

On Sunday, it is Poyet – a perennial nemesis of the black and whites – who brings North-East rivals Sunderland to St James’ Park.

Newcastle have lost the last three derbies. And therein, perhaps, lies the reason why many supporters are siding with a shot at Wembley over victory in the derby.

In a perverse way, they are used to losing the derby now. It hurts, of course – some have even punched horses in protest – but the fear of defeat has been realised. There is no longer a proud record to protect.

There will be more derbies, one as soon as early April. But cup runs and Wembley and days out in the capital with Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden awash in black and white, now they don’t come around twice a season.

If memory of that trip to Wembley 14 years ago has faded, then Newcastle supporters only have to look to Sunderland for reminder of what joy such journeys can bring.

They were beaten in last year’s League Cup final but, for the 40,000 who descended on London, that weekend still ranks as their best of the season, perhaps their best of recent times. It is no coincidence that their DVD season review recorded the third highest sales in the country.

Newcastle fans want that – and that is why they rank the game at White Hart Lane as the most important of the coming days.

Pardew, you feel, senses as much. He would never answer the poser which is dominating discussion in these parts.

But this is a manager who has lost three successive derbies and survived. That, for now, will not be forgotten. Win a trophy, however, and it may well be forgiven.
