Being overly sensitive to sound could have been the key to the creativity of geniuses like Charles Darwin (pictured), scientists believe

We all find noise annoying – but if it really bothers you it could be because you're a genius.

Being overly sensitive to sound could have been the key to the creativity of geniuses like Charles Darwin and Franz Kafka – who both complained of their difficulty of filtering out noise – research has revealed.

Psychologists now believe that an inability to shut out irrelevant sensory information could be strongly linked to creativity.

French writer Marcel Proust was famous for wearing earplugs and lining his bedroom with cork to block out the outside sound while he worked.

And Kafka once said 'I need solitude for my writing; not "like a hermit" - that wouldn't be enough - but like a dead man.'

Darwin and write Anton Chekhov were also known to have complained about how they found it difficult to filter out noise.

Scientists at Northwestern University, Illinois, tested 100 people on their ability to find original solutions to problems and found strong links between an inability to shut out irrelevant audio stimuli, dubbed 'leaky' sensory gating, and creativity.

In tests 100 people were provided solutions to scenarios, with the challenge of coming up with as many original answers as possible.

This was designed to measure their level of 'real world creative achievement'.

The findings, published in the journal Neuropsychologia, suggest those with the affliction might find it easier to think creatively as they can focus on a wide range of things simultaneously.

Darya Zabelina, a PhD psychology student at Northwestern University in Illinois said: 'If funnelled in the right direction, these sensitivities can make life more rich and meaningful, giving experiences more subtlety.'
