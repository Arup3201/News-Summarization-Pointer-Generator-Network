Case: The jury at Mark Duggan's inquest will hear evidence from a witness who claims she saw police plant a gun at the scene of his death

An eyewitness will accuse police of planting a gun near the body of Mark Duggan after they shot him.

Duggan, whose death sparked the 2011 riots in England, was shot twice by a marksman who had halted his taxi.

Officers insist the 29-year-old had a gun wrapped in a sock and was raising it ready to use lethal force.

But a witness, known only as Miss J, insists police took a weapon from the taxi and left it near the scene.

The claim emerged yesterday just before the jury at Duggan’s inquest was taken to the street in Tottenham, north London, where he was shot in August 2011.

Ashley Underwood, QC, counsel to the inquest, told jurors they would hear evidence from Miss J.

‘She lived nearby and she said she was close enough to see the colour of the gloves somebody was wearing when doing CPR (on Duggan),’ he said.

‘I need to explore with Miss J whether her evidence suggests the police took the gun from the minicab and planted it.

'All of that evidence will give you the opportunity to explore that possibility.’

The inquest has heard that the officer who pulled the trigger, known by his codename of V53, says he acted in self defence.

The marksman has made a statement insisting he saw Duggan lift his right arm and point a gun toward him.

Another armed officer, known as W70, 
also claims he saw a gun in Duggan’s hand.

But when police looked on the
roadside near his body they found nothing.

A handgun with one bullet in it was later found behind a railing, between 10 and 20 feet from Duggan’s body.

Mr
Underwood told the inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice: ‘Common 
sense will tell you when you’re in a fast-moving dramatic situation, 
however highly trained you are, you may miss things.

‘So the gun may have been thrown, it may have been kicked there later on by somebody trying to do first aid.’

Yesterday
the jury was taken to Leyton in east London where Duggan was allegedly 
given a handgun by Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, who has been jailed for 11 
years.

The jury was then 
taken on the route Duggan travelled in the minicab from Leyton to 
Tottenham where three unmarked police cars following him conducted a 
‘hard stop’.

Duggan was a 
member of Tottenham ManDem, one of Britain’s most notorious gangs, and 
was suspected of being on his way to Broadwater Farm to carry out a 
murder when the minicab was intercepted, the inquest has been told.

Counsel 
for the inquest Ashley Underwood, QC, said armed officers tried to shock
Duggan ‘into submission’ by performing a ‘hard stop’ on the taxi by 
blocking it with three unmarked police cars.

Addressing
the jury, he said: ‘Regrettably you will hear it didn’t work, in the 
sense that Mr Duggan wasn’t shocked into submission,’ he said.

‘He
got out of the minicab and he ran. You will also hear, of course, from 
V53 that he was running with a gun in his hand and he started to bring 
that gun up into the aim (position).

‘That
police officer will tell you that the reason he fired was because he 
saw what he believed to be a gun wrapped in a sock in Mr Duggan’s hand 
and that he was presenting it in a way that was threatening and that he 
fired in self-defence.

‘One of the shots hit Mr Duggan on the inside of his right bicep, but didn’t do very much damage.

Evidence: Photograph shows the bullet-holed jacket worn by Mark Duggan on the night he was shot

CCTV captured the taxi in which the father-of-four was travelling when it was stopped by armed police. The jury visited the scene yesterday

‘The
second went through his chest and came out his back going through his 
aorta, the main artery which pumps blood into the heart, and was fatal.’

Less than half an hour before the shooting Duggan had allegedly picked 
up a gun from Hutchinson-Foster.

Detectives
had set up a covert surveillance operation on Duggan and five other 
suspects because of their believed links to the gang.

The 
criminal network has been linked to dozens of murders since its members 
started drugs trafficking on the notorious Broadwater Farm Estate in 
Tottenham from the mid-1980s.

Mr Underwood said Scotland Yard had set up Operation Dibri to thwart the illegal activities of the TMD gang.

‘They
were concentrating on a gang based in Tottenham called for short TMD 
and they believed that Mr Duggan was a gang member and was going to pick
up a gun from a man called Kev or Kevin,’ he said.

He
also told the jury that Duggan and Hutchinson-Foster appeared to speak 
on the phone several times before the gun was allegedly handed over.

Mr
Underwood told the jury that they will need to decide if Duggan was 
holding gun when he was shot, if it was necessary for the marksman to 
fire twice and if the police operation was planned and implemented in a 
way that minimised lethal force.

The hearing, which is expected to last two months, continues.
