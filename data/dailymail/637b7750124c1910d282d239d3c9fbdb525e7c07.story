The Swedish Lapland's iconic Icehotel is now open for business.

Over the last several weeks, 42 artists from around the world have gathered in the village of Jukkasjarvi to create the stunning hotel and art exhibition to celebrate its 25th anniversary.

Using 1,600 tonnes of ice and snow from the nearby frozen Torne River, the 'pop up' hotel was one of the first of its kind when it was originally built in 1990.

This cosy hotel suite is comprised of 12 frames, which form a gradient and offer the illusion of infinity

The 'Borderland' room is inspired by the folk art that decorated the typical wooden houses of the region of eastern Poland 

This year's ice bar is called 'Boom,' as it appears to have risen out of an enormous ice explosion

Each year it opens in December before melting away the following March.

For this season, there are 16 individually designed 'art suites' based on concepts such as the perception of time, the change of seasons and the idea of love.

Designs range from frozen forest fairies to the inner workings of a clock to a human-sized chess board.

There are also two deluxe suites, which each have an en-suite bathroom and sauna.

To celebrate the Icehotel's 25th year, Kristian Anttila played a concert in the main Aurora Hall, which is made entirely of ice

The design is inspired by a giant pressure wave that has forced sharp blocks of ice through the bar, sending snow and ice splashing upwards

Suite 305 is better known as the 'Hot Type' suite where letterpress typography, which are hand-carved, protrude from the wall

The room was designed by graphic designers and typography enthusiasts, who used the fonts baskerville, bodoni and futura in the suite

The reception and main hall have been designed to honour those who helped in the Icehotel's construction, including a gallery of illuminated photography and sculptures of local wildlife.

This year's ice bar appears as though it was risen from a giant explosion - with shards of ice decorating the walls and a large dance floor.

For its anniversary, Icehotel is also unveiling the Aurora Hall, a 1,800-square-foot dome-shaped theatre, which can be rented out for private functions and live performances for up to 150 people.

The Aurora Hall is made of solid ice, which creates a unique acoustic environment and also offers a transparent ceiling.

Sweden's Icehotel is officially open for its 25th year. The hotel uses 1,600 tonnes of ice and snow from the nearby Torne River

In suite 303, 'Spring' has come early - and it is inspired by the colours and scents that arise when winter ends and nature comes back to life

Suite 320 is called 'Two As One' and is a visual representation of the moment of perfection that ensues when love strikes

'Abject Beauty' is the theme of suite 316 where five extremely detailed and anatomical sculptures grow out of the wall

This will also be the first year that the hotel will offer a well-being escape, designed for those looking for a healthy break in a very cool setting.

Guests will have the opportunity to try out winter running using specially designed grippers on one of the scenic trails.

Adventurous visitors can also try cross-country skiing, take part in a snowmobiling excursion or try their hand at dog-sledding.
