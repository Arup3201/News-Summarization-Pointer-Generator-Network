Brazil's starting striker Hulk has left the team's training session with an apparent muscle injury in his left leg.

Hulk, who started alongside Neymar and Fred in the tournament opener against Croatia, practiced for less than 15 minutes on Sunday when he felt something in his leg and left the field.

He was walking without a limp, but then sat down on a bench and lowered his head in apparent dismay. A few moments later, he went to the locker room accompanied by one of the team's doctors.

Taking on: Hulk worried the Croatian defence on Thursday with his direct running and powerful play

Support: The Porto forward has been playing alongside centre-forward Fred and Brazil's super-star Neymar

Blow: Losing Hulk would be a significant problem for Brazil, who face Mexico in a tough clash on Tuesday

The Brazilian federation is yet to comment on the injury, which apparently happened after he scored a goal during the session.

The injury came in one of the team's final practices before Tuesday's potentially tricky match against Mexico in Group A.

Brazil will travel to the northeastern city of Fortaleza on Sunday afternoon.
