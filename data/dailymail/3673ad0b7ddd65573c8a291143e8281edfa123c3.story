The lawyer for the neighbourhood watch captain charged with killing Trayvon Martin in February has waived his right to a quick trial while he prepares his defence.

Attorney Mark O’Mara, who is representing George Zimmerman, filed the motion in a Florida court today, saying that he needs more time to ready his case.

Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin, 17, a Miami teen who was returning from a store when he was shot by Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida.

Lawyer: Mark O'Mara, who is representing Zimmerman, filed a motion in a Florida court today, saying that he needs more time to prepare his case

Zimmerman claimed he was acting in self-defence after he was 'sucker-punched' by Martin.

Meanwhile, O'Mara said that some of the money raised by Zimmerman’s legal defence fund website is paying for the 28-year-old’s security and living expenses while he stays in hiding before the trial.

O'Mara said that just under $50,000 of the more than $200,000 raised by the now-defunct web page is being used for his security and setting up his living arrangements in hiding.

Defence: George Zimmerman has set up this website to raise funds for his legal costs and living expenses. It was later shut down, but not before it collected more than $200,000

The other $150,000 raised by the website has been turned over to an independent administrator to manage.

The Orlando Sentinel reported that Judge Kenneth Lester planned Zimmerman's next hearing for August 8.

Zimmerman was released from jail last month after paying 10 per cent of a $150,000 bail.

His current whereabouts are being kept secret for his safety and he is very likely outside of Florida.

He worked at a mortgage risk-management company at the time of the shooting and his wife Shellie is in nursing school.

Bail is not unheard of in second-degree 
murder cases, and legal experts had predicted it would be granted for 
Zimmerman because of his ties to the community, because he turned 
himself in after he was charged last week, and because he has never been
 convicted of a serious crime.

Zimmerman told cops that he spotted 
Martin while on patrol in his neighbourhood, which had been plagued by 
burglaries in vandalism in recent months, and called 911 to report a 
suspicious 
person.

'This guy looks like he is up to no 
good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from 
his sport utility vehicle.

He added that the teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes.

'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman was heard saying on the 911 call.

But
 Trayvon was not armed. He was returning from a convenience store with 
an iced tea for himself and a bag of skittles for his little brother.

A neighbour said there had been 
several break-ins in the community in the past year, including one in 
which burglars took a TV and laptops.

Victim: Zimmerman insists that he was acting in self-defence after Trayvon attacked him

A
 dispatcher told Zimmerman to stay in his sport utility vehicle and that
 an officer would be there momentarily, but Zimmerman - for unknown 
reasons - got out.

Zimmerman told police he lost sight of the teenager and was walking back to his vehicle when he was suddenly attacked by the teen.

The case has sparked a massive public outcry with protests erupting among those who believe the shooting was racially motivated.
