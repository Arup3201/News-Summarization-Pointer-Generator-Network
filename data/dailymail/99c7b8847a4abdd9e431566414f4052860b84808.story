The Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee claimed Wednesday that his Democratic counterpart secretly colluded with the Internal Revenue Service to bring about the targeting of conservatives that has gripped politics-watchers for nearly a year.

If true, it would mark the first involvement of an elected politician in a nearly year-long scandal that involved the IRS breaking the law and playing political favorites.

California Rep. Darrell Issa charged in a letter that Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings put a nonprofit tea party group called True the Vote on the IRS's radar by asking the tax agency for information about the organization's activities and its growing corps of volunteers.

When the IRS later targeted the tea party-linked group and its founder, Catherine Engelbrecht, for years of special scrutiny – as it did with hundreds of other right-leaning groups that sought exemptions from federal income taxes – its letters employed language nearly identical to what Cummings' staff had written the IRS.

Liberal groups, generally sailed through the application process quickly.

Emails the House Oversight Committee got just last week show Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings appearing to plant questions for the IRS to ask a conservative group that applied for tax-exempt status

Catherine Engelbrecht, founder of True the Vote and other tea party-linked groups, has told Congress she was targeted by several government agencies -- and the timeline now looks connected to Rep. Cummings' inquiries

True the Vote has attracted barbs from liberal politicians for demanding that states purge dead and ineligible voters from election rolls. The group also supports a national voter-ID requirement, a deal-breaker among all but a handful of Democrats.

Cummings' requests were disclosed in emails that Issa said came to the attention of House investigators only last week, following a GOP grilling of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. The IRS has only grudgingly provided documents that Issa's committee has demanded, and has stonewalled on thousands more pages that are the subject of subpoenas.

'The IRS and the Oversight Minority' Issa said in a statement, referring to Cummings, 'made numerous requests for virtually identical information from True the Vote, raising concerns that the IRS improperly shared protected taxpayer information with Rep. Cummings’ staff.'

Other emails indicate that Lois Lerner, the former IRS official who now faces a likely Contempt of Congress vote and possible criminal prosecution for allegedly violating the 'equal protection' rights of conservatives, shared copies of True the Vote's tax returns with Cummings' office.

The Maryland Democrat, said Issa, demanded that True the Vote send 'copies of all training materials used for volunteers, affiliates, or other entities.'

Five days later the IRS sent the Texas conservative group an email requesting 'a copy of yours volunteer registration form ... the process you use to assign volunteers ... how you keep your volunteers in teams,' and 'how your volunteers are deployed ... following the training they receive by you.'

Lerner became personally involved with Cummings' requests in January 2013 when she asked Holly Paz, an underling, 'Did we find anything?' Getting a negative response, Lerner told Paz to 'check tomorrow please.'

Three days after that exchange, Cummings received the tax return copies. He never shared them with Republicans on the committee, something Issa says he had an obligation to do.

A year later, the Democrat denied during a committee hearing that he had worked with the IRS to target True the Vote.

'We want to get to the bottom of how these coincidences happened,' the group's attorney Cleta Mitchell testified in February, 'and we’re going to try to figure out whether ... there was any staff of this committee that might have been involved in putting True the Vote on the radar screen of some of these federal agencies.'

Cummings leapt up and asked for permission to interrupt. 'What she just said,' he insisted, 'is absolutely incorrect and not true.'

He will likely clash again with Issa on Thursday, when the Oversight Committee meets to consider a measure calling on the entire House to declare that Lerner is in Contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions about the targeting scheme.

In two hearings she has invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; Republicans secured a party-line vote this year declaring that Lerner waived that right by offering a self-serving opening statement before saying she was done talking.

Lerner, who has refused to testify about her role in the IRS's political favoritism, is accused of taking her cues from Cummings in a bid to hobble a tea party group that focuses on voting fairness

In addition to written IRS demands from Lerner and other IRS officials, Engelbrecht found herself hectored with sudden on-site visits from several other government agencies after her organization filed its application for so-called 501(c)(4) status, a designation that would allow it to operate tax-free while providing a benefit to the public.

One by one the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Occupational Health and Safety Administration; and the Texas Commission on Environment Quality – an partner organization of the federal Environmental Protection Agency – descended on her with written demands and licenses to inspect her property.

ATF demanded to see her family's firearms.

The Obama administration has pledged that it would pursue its own aggressive investigation of the IRS's politically motivated activities.

Barbara Bosserman, a trial attorney within the IRS's civil-rights enforcement division, has been appointed to lead that probe.

Conservatives point out that Bosserman may not be an impartial sleuth since she 'maxed out' on her legal eligibility to donate to President Obama's successful political campaigns.

The group was one of hundreds whose applications for tax exemptions were delayed in a scheme to single out right-wingers for their beliefs

Lois Lerner, the former IRS official then in charge of vetting and monitoring tax-exempt nonprofit groups, was involved in responding to Cummings

At one point the IRS sent the Democratic pol copies of True the Vote's confidential tax returns.

Lerner has refused to testify about her part in the scandal, and the House Oversight Committee will soon vote on a Contempt of Congress citation
