Daley Blind scored late on to rescue his side a point as Manchester United struggled to cope with Sam Allardyce's West Ham.

West Ham looked like they were going to claim the win thanks to Cheikhou Kouyate's opener until Blind struck late on.

Here, Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham rates each player as the Hammers moved to within four points of the Red Devils.

WEST HAM (4-1-2-1-2)

Adrian - 7.5

Great save with his foot to deny Van Persie who was in acres of space inside the box in the final 10 minutes and was sharp all afternoon.

Carl Jenkinson - 6.5

Close to scoring with a right-hand side cross which dipped over De Gea and almost into the top left corner but fell narrowly wide. 

Cheikhou Kouyate - 8

Started the game in central defence instead of his usual midfield position but played like a striker as he took a touch on the turn to score the opener. 

Cheikhou Kouyate impressed as a makeshift defender and managed to get on the scoresheet 

James Tomkins - 7

Came close to breaking the deadlock with a back-post header from Aaron Cresswell’s ball. Dealt with Van Persie and Falcao well. 

Aaron Cresswell - 6.5 

His accurate delivery on long free kick duty ramped the pressure on a United side who were struggling to keep organised at the back.

Alex Song - 6

Almost gifted United an opener right at the start after passing to Van Persie inside his own box but Kouyate managed to cover. 

Mark Noble - 6.5

Great ball into the box from a free kick which United failed to clear allowing Kouyate to score West Ham’s first goal.

Kevin Nolan - 6

He seemed to have little impact on proceedings, on current form unable to reach the heights

Stewart Downing - 6

Went quietly about his business in behind the to forwards, passing well and helping West Ham retain possession for long periods of the game.  

Enner Valencia - 7

Tested De Gea twice within a minute with a rasping 25-yard drive then close-range effort. 

Diafra Sakho - 6.5 

Alongside Valencia the pair formed a formidable partnership up top that was hard for United’s defence to handle. Strong, bustling and battling.

Matt Jarvis (Enner Valencia 84) 

Sam Allardyce

Unfortunate not to come away with the win. Tactically he got it spot-on, playing some attractive football along the way, but they were finally broken in the dying minutes of the game.

MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-2-1-2)

David de Gea - 7

Superb double save to stop Valencia twice within the space of a minute and then a third with his right foot denying Tomkins, until he was finally breached. Kept two more out late on, too. 

David de Gea made a number of fine saves before West Ham opened the scoring in the 49th minute 

Antonio Valencia - 6

A threat going forward, providing another option on the right flank, but too much of a liability in his defensive positioning. 

Phil Jones - 6

Didn’t look the right fit alongside Rojo in the centre of United’s defence. He had a solid game, but not his greatest. 

Marcos Rojo - 5.5

Had a torrid afternoon trying to deal with the power of Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia and was booked for a late challenge on James Tomkins. Not his best game. 

Luke Shaw - 5

Made attempts to stretch West Ham down the left-hand side by over-lapping Januzaj but his match was marred by the sending off in stoppage time for two yellows. 

Daley Blind - 7

Did the required job in front of the back four then popped up with the equaliser at the death.

Wayne Rooney - 6

Tried to pull the strings from the centre of midfield but United then lacked his dynamism up front. Kouyate’s goal came off his shoulder when he should’ve jumped in to block. 

Adnan Januzaj -  6

Kept getting on the ball trying to make things happen but failing to do so. Inventive but lacking a final product. 

Angel di Maria - 6

This sort of performance is simply not acceptable for a player who cost them the best part of £60million; quiet, a few nice crosses and the odd shot, not value for money. 

Radamel Falcao - 5.5

Had a quiet first half and did not provide the movement up front to cause West Ham any real problems. He got behind West Ham’s defence for a split second in the second half but missed.

Robin van Persie - 6

Lucky to escape with just a talking to from referee Mark Clattenburg when's flailing arm caught James Tomkins and knocked him down. Great chance to score early in the second chance.

Marouane Fellaini (Adnan Januzaj 72) -  6

Louis van Gaal

Played too many players out of their strongest position and only one out-right midfielder in Daley Blind. It meant the team’s organisation was all over the place. Escaped with the draw.
