The mystery surrounding the brutal murder of beloved teacher Colleen Rizter took another twist today after it emerged a judge has banned ‘distressing’ evidence against Philip Chism from being made public.

Ever since last Tuesday’s horrific slaying - during which Chism, 14, allegedly slashed Colleen’s throat with a boxcutter in a bathroom at Danver’s High School, Massachusetts – friends and family of the victim have desperately tried to uncover a motive for the seemingly senseless crime.

Chism allegedly confessed to the killing when he was arrested at 12.30am on Wednesday morning, but the freshman, described as ‘stone cold’ by one officer has refused to say why he did it.

Now a number of media organizations are launching a legal challenge to overturn Salem District Court Judge Michael Lauranzano’s order hiding details of a potentially explosive search warrant, which could finally shed some light on Chism’s motive.

Investigators searched Chism’s family home in Danvers – a couple of miles away from the murder scene – but their findings have been kept secret. 

The reasons why the warrant was requested in the first place have also been banned, along with the actual motion from the Essex County District Attorney’s office requesting the court order. 

Certain other details of the case have also been sealed - including an affidavit outlining the facts of the investigation - all of which would normally be available to the public, particularly as Chism has been charged as an adult.

When the District Attorney’s office explained the decision it claimed one of the reasons was to save 24-year-old Ritzer’s distraught family from even more upset.

It issued a statement saying: 'We requested the impoundment because the search warrant affidavit and the motion to impound the affidavit contain sensitive information that may be prejudicial to the defendant and jeopardize his right to a fair trial; witness names who have yet to appear before the Grand Jury and information that may contribute to the increased psychological and emotional distress of the victim’s family.'

But now a number of media outlets, including local papers The Salem News and Eagle-Tribune are fighting the decision.

Peter Caruso, of the firm Caruso and Caruso, which is representing The Salem News and Eagle-Tribune, argued in a motion filed on Tuesday morning that the DA’s reasons for the motion are not strong enough.

He wrote: 'The press’s ability to keep the public informed is premised in large part on open access to the court system, and on its ability to examine and report on judicial documents.

'The impoundment challenged by (the newspapers) here seeks to deny that access, and will impede the press from carrying out its important responsibility of reporting fully and accurately on a newsworthy matter of legitimate public concern.'

A hearing has been scheduled for Monday and if the challenge is successful, questions about Chism’s motive could finally be answered, bringing some kind of closure to the people of Danvers.

Ever since Tuesday afternoon’s tragedy friends and family have struggled to understand how Chism, a shy, but pleasant student could savagely murder one of the most popular teachers at the school.

Her funeral on Monday attracted hundreds of mourners, but no one there had any idea why Chism apparently did what he did.

Police sources have told the MailOnline they are looking into the theory that the star soccer player, who only moved to Danvers, from Clarksville, Tennessee at the start of the school year, had developed feelings for Ritzer and he snapped when she spurned his advances.

But all that is certain are the details of the murder, which happened around 3.30pm on Tuesday, while the school was still crowded with children.

The Boston Globe reports that the last public interaction between teacher Colleen Ritzer and her killer Phillip Chism came when she saw him drawing in class.

Another student recalls seeing Ms Ritzer notice his sketching and she said matter-of-factly: 'I didn't know you could draw.'

Rania Rhaedaoui was in the class and said Chism just nodded in response.

'There was a test coming up and she wanted to know if he had any questions,' Rania added.

A different student saw the two together an hour after the last class of the day had ended, and she was standing next to him as he was sitting down by her computer.

'It just looked normal, like any other day,' Cambria Cloutier told The Boston Globe.

But soon after Chism allegedly followed Colleen into a bathroom in the school then punched her in the face and slashed her throat with a box cutter before stuffing her lifeless body in a recycling bin. 

He then dumped the body, the boxcutter and his blood stained clothes in woods just behind the school, before changing into a sweat suit he had brought with him to class.

Around 45 minutes later Chism was caught on security camera looking calm and composed at the Hollywoods Hits movie theatre, where he watched the 4.30pm showing of Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmin.

He then walked to a local Wendy’s where he apparently bought food with Ritzer’s stolen credit card. Chism was picked up by police walking along a road in neighboring Topsfield at 12.30 on Wednesday morning.

Why? Police have not revealed why Chism allegedly killed the popular teacher. One source told MailOnline that detectives still don't know themselves and the student has offered no explanation

Last week police sources told the MailOnline Chism had been completely co-operative with investigators, telling them exactly what had happened, but refusing to give any kind of motive.

A well-placed police insider said: 'When we picked him up wandering around early on Wednesday night, he was subdued and showed very little emotion. He was stone cold.

'With the help of camera around the campus we were able to build up a very clear picture of events.

'He didn't deny anything and did not hold back information. But he would give absolutely no reason why he did it. There seems to no rhyme or reason. That is very rare. If someone is going to reveal what they did, they would usually give a reason, because, however mad their views, they want people to know what their motive was.

'We are obviously working on theories, based on intelligence and intuition, but until he actually tells us what was going on in his head, it will be incredibly hard to give a definitive answer.

'One thing we do think is that this was completely planned. He brought a change of clothes with him into school and changed after the attack. He dumped the body, his original clothes and the box cutter in the woods.

'That has all been found and is now evidence in the investigation. It is incredible to think he did this in the day, when other children were about. There was soccer practice going on. It is just so strange.'

Meanwhile, a copy of Ritzer’s death certificate obtained on Tuesday by the Boston Herald states she was pronounced dead at 3 a.m. last Wednesday after her remains were found in a recycling bin in woods beside the high school, but that her time of death was 'unknown'.

The report confirms an autopsy was conducted, but notes that the cause and manner of her death were 'pending investigation'.
