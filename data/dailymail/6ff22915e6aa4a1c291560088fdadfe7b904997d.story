Alan Johnson giving a statement on the Ireland bailout in 2010 during his time as shadow chancellor

Despite fewer and fewer people reading them, publishers keep churning out politicians’ memoirs. Out of duty I try to read most of them – but usually stop in a state of nausea after a few chapters, as the fantasy and the titanic self-regard, not to mention the shocking standard of writing, become too much.

But last year, for the first time in decades, I found myself gripped by a politician’s autobiography. It revealed an honesty, humanity, realism and decency that were sincere, beautifully expressed, and which left me in awe.

The book was This Boy, Alan Johnson’s account of growing up in the 1950s in what was then down-at-heel West London, in a home that was exceptionally deprived. His father had deserted the family, and his mother – whose values of decency are a constant point of reference for him – died when he was 12.

Mr Johnson, who went on to be a Labour Home Secretary, tells how he was raised in a council flat by his devoted sister (barely more than a child herself, and the heroine of the book), married at 17 and became a postman. It is a book about the unconquerability of the human spirit, a philosophical idea one encounters all too rarely in modern politicians.

He was always a person of high intelligence and talent. He passed his 11-plus and went to grammar school, but had to leave at 15 to support his family, which he did by stocking shelves in a supermarket.

Many politicians would kill for such a back-story, and would have manipulated this tale for sympathy or support. That Mr Johnson did not is a mark of the man – a man utterly straight and, despite (or perhaps because of) the hardships of that upbringing, of strong character and entirely devoid of self-pity.

It is now reported that a cabal of senior Labour figures is airing the possibility of launching a coup against the increasingly hopeless Ed Miliband and trying to parachute Mr Johnson into the Labour leadership, thereby rescuing the party from its present rudderless, strategy-free state.

I don’t blame them for panicking, and I certainly don’t blame them for identifying Mr Johnson as the man who might – just might – win the public round to Labour again.

The byzantine means by which Labour elects its leaders, and prevents their removal, almost certainly ensures that Mr Miliband is safe in his post for as long as he wishes to occupy it.

Yet it is suggested that friends of Mr Johnson hope he may be persuaded to challenge for the job.

If true, from Labour’s point of view that is good news, because anyone looking in from outside can see that his qualities as a regular bloke – albeit one who had held three senior cabinet posts at Education, Health and the Home Office – would make him an enormous hit with voters in an election campaign.

I have never voted Labour in my life. But as I read his book – the highly-acclaimed sequel to which, Please Mr Postman, has just been published – I could not help thinking that if Mr Johnson were to lead Labour and cast it in his own image, I would not be the only person in Britain who would consider breaking the habit of a lifetime and voting for him.

I’ve long been an admirer of Mr Johnson, who I thought navigated through the collapse of the Brown government with a common sense and dignity that many of his colleagues would have done well to follow.

When they were grandstanding, intriguing and point-scoring, he was usually just getting on with it.

Shortly after Labour’s 2010 defeat and Gordon Brown’s resignation as party leader, I appeared on BBC1’s Question Time with Mr Johnson, and asked him why he had not put his hat in the ring. He replied that family considerations – notably wanting to devote time to his young son, giving him a family life he himself had not enjoyed – precluded it.

Following Ed Miliband’s election, Mr Johnson was appointed shadow chancellor, not least because the new Labour leader wanted a reason not to give the job to Ed Balls, who was deeply unpopular after Labour’s defeat.

Sadly, Mr Johnson’s second marriage broke down shortly afterwards, and he left the shadow cabinet for personal reasons. Mr Balls replaced him.

As well as losing a man who would have been a successful shadow chancellor and would have given their economic policy more coherence, Labour lost someone whose wisdom and level-headedness would have added enormous gravity to an otherwise feeble opposition.

Mr Johnson began as a Marxist and even when he joined Labour more than 40 years ago he considered himself a communist. He has been, and perhaps to an extent still is, a visceral socialist. He refused to buy the council house in which he lived with his first wife, believing the housing stock should be preserved for others in the future.

When health secretary in 2007 he criticised a breast cancer patient for buying a drug not available on the NHS, saying that to mix treatment between the private and public sectors would undermine the ‘founding principles’ of the NHS.

However, there is another side to him. Many years earlier, when still leader of the Communication Workers’ Union, he was the only boss of a significant trade union to back the repeal of Clause Four of Labour’s constitution, which required the party to support public ownership of the means of production. He also recalls in his latest memoir the ‘shame’ he later felt at having ‘colluded’ in breaking the spirit of a postman colleague who refused to join the others on strike.

Mr Johnson says he believes that politics is not about Right and Left, but about right and wrong. For many – and I am one – the fact Mr Johnson started at the bottom, had a real job, and worked his way up to become one of the more moderate and respected trade union leaders would be his greatest qualification to run his party, and possibly the country.

The fact is that the country is crying out for an end to the stranglehold that callow young men with degrees in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford, and early careers as special advisers to cabinet ministers, have on our government.

There is a growing sense that we are living in an age where there is widespread public disrespect for pygmy politicians. This is because too many of those who claim to represent us do nothing of the sort, because they have no idea how life is for millions of people.

A rarefied education is compounded by the fact that they have usually done no more with that privilege than use it to worm their way up the greasy pole of Westminster.

How very different to Alan Johnson. Not only does he have no university education, no trust fund or link to the old boy network, but he spent years before becoming a union official pounding pavements and, as he says in his latest book, feeding people’s cats when they went away as part of the normal, decent, human interaction a postman would have with his customers.

He had to struggle to provide for a family while doing a job that was unglamorous and poorly paid. Its rewards, however, were a vital understanding of people – something that too many of today’s politicians could never dream of having.

We’ll soon find out how serious Labour is about winning next May’s general election from whether they have the courage to get rid of Mr Miliband as their leader.

And with Alan Johnson – a genuine, highly articulate and deeply principled working-class hero, respected by Tory voters – available to be persuaded to succeed him, one wonders what on earth they are waiting for.
