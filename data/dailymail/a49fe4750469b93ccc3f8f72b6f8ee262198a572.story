Didier Drogba  puts his retirement from international football down to a matter of 'trust'.

The 36-year-old announced his decision  via his official Twitter account on Friday and confirmed his final game for the Ivory Coast was at the World Cup in a 2-1 loss to Greece.

Ivorian Football Federation president Augustin Sidy Diallo admitted his 'surprise considering the future deadlines' of the captain, and promised to contact the striker in order to 'understand the reasons behind this decision'.

Drogba, though, made it clear the decision was not because he felt he wasn't good enough.

'The World Cup was not a difficult one to experience,' said Drogba. 'What was difficult to experience was certain words that were pretty difficult to swallow.

'It's a difficult decision because I know what I am able to do, but if I feel that I do not have the trust like I had before, then I think my decision is wise.' 

Drogba's statement announcing his retirement came as a shock to fans and Ivory Coast staff.

It read: 'It is with much sadness that I have decided to retire from international football.

'These past 12 years in the national team have been full of emotions. From my first call up to my last match, I have always tried to give my best for my country.

'I am very proud to have been captain of this team for eight years and to have contributed to placing my country on the world stage of football, taking part in three World Cups and two African Cup of Nations finals.

'I cannot convey enough thanks to the fans for all the love and support during these years. All my goals, all my caps, all our victories are for you - I love you. 

'I also owe much gratitude to my team mates - the players with whom I have shared all these emotions and I wish you all much success for the future and a very warm welcome to the new manager.'
