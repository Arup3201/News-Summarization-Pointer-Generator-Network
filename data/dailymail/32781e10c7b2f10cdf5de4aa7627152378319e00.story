Printer Philip Lewis was looking forward to a relaxing drink after work when he stopped at an Esso garage.

He was in for a disappointment however. The assistant would not serve Mr Lewis, 58, who has a moustache and receding grey hair because he could not prove his age.

Mr Lewis did not have any photographic identification on him – and was forced to leave empty-handed.

No ID No lager: 58-year-old Philip Lewis was refused four cans of lager at a garage in Somerset because he could not prove he was over 18

Petrol station managers have since apologised and admitted the shop assistant had applied ‘a little too much zeal’ to its strict policy on alcohol sales.

Mr Lewis, of Radstock, Somerset, said: ‘I could understand it if I was nearer 25 and looked that way but I will be 59 in June. I don’t carry my driving licence with me.

‘There was a queue behind me and I felt really humiliated and demoralised. I reckon I spend about £2,000 in there on petrol and magazines over a year – and I was made to feel like that at my age.’

Refusal: This Esso garage in Midsomer Norton, Somerset. refused to serve Philip Lewis with four cans of lager because Mr Lewis, 58, could not prove he is over 18

The garage that likes to say no: A shop assistant at this Esso petrol station refused to serve 58-year-old Philip Lewis with lager because he had no photographic proof of age on him

Mr Lewis said he is boycotting the Norton Service Station in Midsomer Norton, Somerset, after the incident.

A spokeman for the garage said: ‘We apologise to Mr Lewis for any offence or inconvenience caused during his visit to the service station.

‘While we have strict rules concerning the sale of alcohol, it is clear they were applied with a little too much zeal on this occasion.

‘We have advised the sales assistant accordingly, and will contact Mr Lewis to offer him a small gift as a goodwill gesture.’

Selling alcohol to someone under 18 can lead to a maximum fine of £20,000 for bar staff/managers.

Retailers can reserve the right to refuse the sale of alcohol to an adult if they’re accompanied by a child and think the alcohol is being bought for the child.

In 2005, the British Beer and Pub Association introduced a Challenge 21 campaign to prevent underage drinking.

This has evolved into the Challenge 25 policy of most supermarkets in England and Wales including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons along with Marks & Spencer, The Co-operative, Bargain Booze and Waitrose. Esso also take part in the scheme.

However, the scheme has no official or legally enforceable basis.
