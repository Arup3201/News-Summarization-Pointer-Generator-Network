New York City bars have complained anti-booze campaigners are trying to drive them out of business on the Lower East Side.

The group - who at the end of last year released a 12-minute video of drunken revelry and destruction in NYC's 'Hell Square' - are said to seize on every minor violation as an excuse to call in the authorities.

The two blocks in the Lower East Side, saturated with bars, are a go-to destination for Manhattan dwellers on a night out.

Infuriated with the 'demonic possession' of the area, the 12-minute YouTube video from December by neighborhood group LES Dwellers has been designed to drive the partygoers out. 

'Hell Square': A video taken in New York City's Lower East Side at 3.30am displayed typical drunken antics

It is a campaign that has sparked outrage among bars between Ludlow Street and Rivington Street who claim the group is spoiling the fun and needlessly trying to hamper their business.

Taken at around 3.30am on December 21, the video shows a street fight break out, a woman sprawled on the floor, and one man screaming 'PASTRAMI!' for no apparent reason.

A couple slam against a wall after being refused entry to a bar, opting instead to entertain themselves.

Police watch, unsurprised, as they systematically arrest people for brawling.

And one man faces a difficult battle to publicly urinate while struggling to stay awake.

Tumble: This woman could barely speak, had fallen over, ripped her jeans, and took two minutes to stand up

Say it like you mean it: Among the crowds, this man was screaming 'pastrami' for no apparent reason

Arrests: Three fights broke out in the space of 12 minutes leaving police to follow and make arrests

The group, which was founded in 2012, said in a statement: '[This] illustrate[s] how bad the Lower East Side's Hell Square continues as late night bars and clubs continue to foster a SantaCon-style environment of binge drinking, public urination and vomiting, brawls and arrests every weekend.

'What is depicted in the videos is not outside the norm but is the norm. The bars, lounges and restaurants in this area over serve alcohol creating a dangerous environment. 

'This weekend was an outrage—ranking as one of the worst on record: It was SantaCon without the costumes.

He's hit a wall: This man became embroiled in a difficult battle to stay awake while publicly urinating

'Assaults and crime are up in our neighborhood due solely to the proliferation of late night liquor licenses in the neighborhood.' 

But Robert Bookman, counsel to the New York City Hospitality Alliance, told the New York Post, the LES Dwellers are not welcomed by all residents.

'They go for the jugular,' he said. 'They go above and beyond any other community groups I've ever seen. They'll bring up violations you had five years ago.'
