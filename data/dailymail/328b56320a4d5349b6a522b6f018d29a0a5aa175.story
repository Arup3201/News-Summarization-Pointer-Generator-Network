Serial offender: Gary Mayall was jailed for four years and eight months after he admitted to a series of burglaries

A prolific burglar 'commuted' hundreds of miles by train to raid rural homes - but he vowed he would never have stolen from the elderly.

Gary Mayall, 36, travelled from
his home in Oldham, Greater Manchester to break into isolated dwellings in Shropshire and Herefordshire.

Andrew Holland, defending, told Shrewsbury Crown Court
that Mayall was a career criminal but followed a 'code' under which he never targeted a house belonging to a pensioner.

But the argument did not save him from prison after he admitted to three burglaries and asked for a further nine to be taken into account.

The thief was yesterday jailed for four years and eight months.

Mayall was caught after he travelled to picturesque Leominster in Herefordshire and broke into a house on November 23 last year.

Five days later, he journeyed to Church Stretton, Shropshire, where he burgled two neighbouring houses.

But suspicious locals in Church Stretton spotted him lurking by a house and rang the police.

Speaking after the case, Detective Inspector Peter Brophy, of West Mercia Police said: 'Mayall was a travelling criminal who came to Shropshire and Herefordshire to break into people's homes.

'He is a prolific burglar with a long list of crimes to his name.

'But thanks to the support of members of the public in Church Stretton and an excellent response from local police officers, he was quickly arrested, despite trying to make good his escape.

'Several local people called the police when they spotted Mayall acting suspiciously near homes.

'They did exactly the right thing by calling us immediately.

'Our officers were then able to respond quickly and more or less caught him in the act.'

People from Church Stretton yesterday expressed relief at the sentence.

One said: 'He was basically commuting to our lovely town every now and again in order to break into our homes.

'This character treated burglary as a job and everyone is delighted he is where he belongs - behind bars.'
