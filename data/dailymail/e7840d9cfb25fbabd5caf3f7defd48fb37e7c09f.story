Mauricio Pochettino will inform Tottenham's existing coaching staff of their futures in a series of meetings this week.

Coaches Tony Parks, Chris Ramsey, Steffen Freund and Les Ferdinand's futures are all unclear after the sacking of Tim Sherwood and subsequent appointment of Pochettino.

And the new White Hart Lane boss will inform the quartet of their futures in crunch talks over the next 48 hours.

Decision maker: Mauricio Pochettino is likely to bring his staff with him from Southampton after being named Tottenham boss

Allies: Pochettino could bring Jesus Perez, Miguel D'Agostino and Toni Jiminez to Tottenham

Pochettino has brought with him assistant manager Jesus Perez, first team coach Miguel D'Agostino and goalkeeper coach Toni Jiminez from Southampton.

The fact the Argentine has brought three of his trusted aides with him to Spurs means the likelihood of departures is almost inevitable.

And Sportsmail understands the decision to relieve goalkeeper coach Parks of his duties has already been taken given the arrival of Jiminez.

Pochettino met with many of his new club colleagues today as he arrived at the club's Enfield HQ for his first full day as new Tottenham manager.

It is understood that he will take a short holiday next week before returning to England ahead of his official unveiling as Sherwood's successor.

Loyal servant: Les Ferdinand is one of the Tottenham coaches whose future is at risk

In danger: Steffen Freund is another whose future at Tottenham will be decided by Pochettino imminently
