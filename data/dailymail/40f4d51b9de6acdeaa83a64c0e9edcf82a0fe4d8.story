Murder: Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando was killed on her doorstep with a single bullet to the head - and today a gang of Serbian assassins has been linked to her killing

A team of Serbian security agents who held top positions in the hated regime of Slobodan Milosevic have today been linked with the unsolved murder of Jill Dando.

In a bizarre claim made today, it is said the tyrant held a grudge against the BBC presenter because she made a successful TV appeal to get help for the millions of Kosovan refugees displaced by his murderous regime.

The four men accused of being involved are wanted over a string of political murders in their home country.

A widow of one of their alleged victims said Miss Dando's execution in April 1999 has all the hallmarks of her own husband's murder, which was two weeks earlier.

Miss Dando, 37, was shot once in the head outside her home in Fulham, south west London, on April 26, 1999.

Neighbours found her slumped against her front door in a pool of blood.

The crime shocked Britain and has not been solved, after Barry George was acquitted after eight years in prison. The Serbian connection has been made repeatedly in the years since her death, but never proven.

He was cleared after two trials and two appeals after a jury accepted the evidence was 'thin' and he lacked the IQ and expertise to carry out what was called the 'perfect murder'.

Serbian historian Branka Prpa was with her husband, Slavko Curuvija when he was shot dead 
outside their home in Belgrade on April 11, 1999 - 15 days before Miss 
Dando was killed outside her home in Fulham, west London.

She believes that the same people who killed her husband came to London to kill Miss Dando.

However, senior Scotland Yard sources said there was 'not a shred of evidence' that Miss Dando killed by Serb assassin.

She told the Daily Mirror: 
'Considering the fact that it is absolutely clear the security service 
committed my husband’s murder, I believe those are the people that could
 be involved in the murder of Jill Dando.

'The ­methodology of the shootings is the same.
 It is very possible and is not unrealistic that this is the work of the
 same people.'

The suspects in his murder have been named as Radomir Markovic, Milan Radonjic, Ratko Romic and Miroslav Kurak.

Suspects: Rade Markovic is already in prison for 40 years for the murder of a former president. Slobodan Milosevic (right) was said to hold a grudge against the BBC presenter

Held: Ratko Romi, a former security chief, and Milan Radonjic were both arrested and are in custody

Fourth man: Miroslav Kurak is said to be in east Africa and is set to face an international arrest warrant to get him back to Serbia, according to reports

Similarities? Murdered Serbian media publisher Slavko Curuvija,  right, walks hand-in-hand with wife, historian Branka Prpa,  Belgrade, shortly before he was murdered on April 11, 1999.  Curuvija was one of the leading critics of then-Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic.

During the police investigation into Jill Dando's murder, Barry George was the number one suspect. But in the year before he was arrested many theories emerged.

The first was that her killing was ordered by a vengeful underworld Mr Big, jailed after one of her Crimewatch programmes.

The manner in which she was killed, a single shot to the head, is the hallmark of an assassin and added to that theory.

Another was that she was killed by jealous ex-lover. Miss Dando was engaged to Dr Alan Farthing, who helped deliver Prince George last year.

It was alleged that a former lover may have ordered her killing to stop their marriage but Scotland Yard have ruled out past boyfriends as suspects.

But the link to Serbia has repeatedly come up, because warlord Milosevic was upset she had made an appeal for Kosovan refugees.The suspects have been named as Radomir Markovic, Milan Radonjic, Ratko Romic and Miroslav Kurak.

Markovic is the former head of the Serbian National Security Service, known as DB and serving 40 years for the murder of former Serb president Ivan Stambolic.                                               

Radonjic and Romic, who are both former DB chiefs, were arrested last month in connection with Slavko's death.

Kurak also belonged to the DB. He left Serbia more than a decade ago and is understood to be in Tanzania, East Africa.

Officials are in the process of applying for an international warrant for his arrest.

Kurak also belonged to the DB. He left Serbia more than a decade ago and is understood to be in Tanzania, East Africa.

Ms Prpa has also pointed to a range of 
similarities between Miss Dando’s murder outside her West London home and that of her husband.

Both were high-profile journalists who were returning home when they were assaulted, then shot in the head.

There has been a long-running link between Serbia and Miss Dando's murder.

In the immediate aftermath of the 1999 killing an 
anonymous caller phoned the BBC claiming he had killed the Crimewatch 
presenter over Nato action in the former Yugoslavia .

The
 mystery caller phoned then head of news Tony Hall claiming 
responsibility for the shooting and told him he would be next, it was revealed in confidential BBC 
papers.

Barry Lindsey said Miss Dando was confronted by her 'Mediterranean' killer on her doorstep in 1999 seconds before she was killed.

Mr Lindsey told detectives to search for an olive-skinned man - but he claims they were only interested in evidence linking Barry George to the murder.

Mr George served eight years behind bars for the killing before being acquitted after a retrial in 2008.

The jury took less than two days to return a not guilty verdict.

He was denied up to £500,000 compensation for being wrongly jailed after the Court of Appeal agreed with a minister that Mr George was 'not innocent enough' to be eligible for a pay-off.

'Misfit' Barry George left court a free man in 2008, having endured two trials and two appeals in the battle to prove his innocence after being wrongly jailed for the murder of Jill Dando.

Nine years after the shooting of the TV presenter on her own doorstep, and seven years after George was convicted of the crime, an Old Bailey jury took less than two days to acquit him.

Miss Dando's family have for years faced the grim probability that her murder will never be solved as a result.

At the first trial in 2001, the case against George - who lived 500 yards from Miss Dando's home in Gowan Avenue - was regarded by some as 'thin'. Yet the jury voted 10-1 that George was guilty of murder.

A year after he was jailed, the Appeal Court comprehensively dismissed his appeal.

In a 58-page ruling, judges said the trial had been fair and there remained a compelling case against George

But doubts about his guilt continued, and his sister Michelle Diskin mounted a campaign for justice.

Last November three other Appeal Court judges questioned the value of the forensic evidence which helped convict him.

The judges, led by Lord Phillips, said the jury might have reached a different verdict had they known of doubts about crucial gunshot evidence.

In 2001, the Old Bailey had been told that a microscopic speck of firearms discharge residue, found in a pocket of George's coat, was linked to particles found in Miss Dando's hair and clothes.

But scientists said the particle was worthless as evidence.

It was just as likely that it came from innocent contamination in a police lab or from the general 'environment' as from the murder weapon, and a new trial was ordered.

Before the second prosecution, George's legal team - led by William Clegg QC - successfully argued that the firearms evidence should not be heard by the jury.

Detectives carried out a full forensic review of the evidence using scientific methods not available for the first trial.

They uncovered suspicious blood spots on his clothes but hopes of a direct forensic links between George and Miss Dando were dashed when they turned out to be from George himself.

The prosecution then faced an uphill battle. No weapon has ever been found, there were no witnesses to the killing, and no obvious compelling motive.

But because of a change in the law, they were able to use so-called 'bad character' evidence and a series of women gave evidence about how George 'terrified' and 'intimidated' them in the street during the 1990s.

George was portrayed as a celebrity-obsessed stalker who secretly took thousands of photographs of women and had a fascination with female TV presenters.

Police found 2,248 photographs of women in his home, as well as a gun holster, a list of guns and military magazines.

There was also a picture of George wearing a gas mask and holding a starting pistol - the sort of weapon, said the prosecution, that if converted could have fired the fatal shot.

However, the jury of eight women and four men were not told that George had been convicted of attempted rape.

Nor that he was arrested by police in 1983 - dressed in combat gear, carrying a length of rope and a knife - hiding in bushes outside Kensington Palace in an attempt to see Diana, Princess of Wales.

George did not give evidence during his retrial. His barrister argued that he did not have the motive or the expertise to do what many people may think was 'the perfect crime'.

William Clegg described his client's intellect as being comparable to a '40-watt bulb'.

Eventually Barry, 53, did indeed walk free as an innocent man, after he was acquitted on August 1 2008.
