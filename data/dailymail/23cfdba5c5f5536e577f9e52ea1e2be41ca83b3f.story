A Malian woman has spoken of how she was thrown into an Islamist prison and given 15 lashes a day for letting a veil slip off her head.

Residents in Timbuktu have been speaking for the first time of a rule of fear under Al Qaeda-linked Islamist rebels, who had controlled the city until it was re-taken by French and Malian troops at the weekend.

People have been openly smoking on the city's streets for the first time in months - something that would have earned them swift retribution only a few days ago.

Imprisoned: A Malian women has spoken of how she was locked up and lashed 15 times a day for letting her veil slip off her head

Prison: The woman showed the two square metre cell which she had to share with up to 14 other detainees

Punishment: The woman said she was taken to the jail and beaten 15 times a day for letting her veil slip

Free: The woman was speaking after Islamist rebels, who had ruled the city for nine months, were forced out of Timbuktu by French and Malian forces

One woman told French broadcaster TF1 how she was thrown into prison and given 15 lashes a day. Her crime had been to let a veil over her head slip, revealing her hair underneath.

She showed the two square metre cell which she had to share with up to 14 other detainees.

'I had the veil and it fell off my head. The took me off to prison and there, they beat me. Every day 15 lashes with a whip,' said the woman who put on a dress adorned with a sticker commemorating International Women's Day.

Precious 13th century manuscripts in Timbuktu were torched by the retreating Islamist rebels shortly before the northern Malian city was re-taken over the weekend.

Ground forces backed up by paratroops from the French Foreign Legion re-took the city, which fell into rebel hands nine months ago. French President Francois Hollande ordered a military intervention earlier this month to halt the rebels' move southwards towards the capital, Bamako.

The woman told TF1: 'Really. We really thank France for having freed us from their claws. We really thank France. Long live France.'

Accusation: Crowds rounded on people suspected of having collaborated with the Islamist rebels who left the city at the weekend

Damaged: Meanwhile, in Timbuktu's library, precious 13th century manuscripts were torched by the retreating Islamist rebels

Elsewhere, crowds rounded on people suspected of having collaborated with the Islamist rebels. One man was berated by an angry throng of people but protested his innocence. 'Yes, I rallied to their ranks. But to fight them,' he said.

In Timbuktu's library, all that remained of precious 13th century texts were strewn on the floor, reduced forever to ashes.

Other French broadcasters said some manuscripts may have been saved prior to Islamists' takeover of the city.

Celebrate: Residents openly smoke on the city's streets for the first time in months

'They know that this is the heart for the people of Timbuktu. When they touch our manuscripts, they touch us. And all the city was quiet. All the people did was to cry,' said a man in the library.

On the streets outside angry residents beat on the doors of shops they said belonged to people who collaborated with the Islamist rebels. Two men argued over an air rifle.

But as the crowds rejoiced, others got 
to work eradicating all traces of the Islamists' grim rule over the city
-- painting over the sign that sat above what was the Islamic police 
station.
