Marks & Spencer’s ‘leading ladies’ advertising campaign has failed to win new customers for the ailing store, a new poll reveals.

The ‘make or break’ campaign, launched amid much fanfare last month, has flopped because it has failed to resonate with middle-class customers, research suggests.

To promote the new autumn clothing range, the company drafted in a dozen ‘iconic’ women, such as Olympic boxing gold medal winner Nicola Adams and ballerina Darcey Bussell.

Not so iconic: According to industry insiders, Dame Helen Mirren was the only figure in the adverts regarded by many as a household name and an icon to middle Britain

But a survey by polling company YouGov UK has found that despite M&S spending up to £5 million on the advertising blitz, consumers have been unimpressed.

The survey found that nearly 40 per cent of the adult population had seen the advertising by last week after the campaign had been in full swing for more than a month.

But the number that said they planned to buy M&S clothes increased only slightly, from 23 per cent to 24 per cent. Among women, the figure was slightly higher at 25 per cent.

YouGov chief operating officer Tim Britton said: ‘It’s no secret M&S’s retail arm, particularly women’s fashion, is struggling and our research shows that while consumers are aware of the campaign, it has not yet made them want to go out and buy M&S clothing.’

According to industry insiders, Dame Helen Mirren was the only figure in the adverts regarded by many as a household name and an icon to middle Britain.

The inclusion of controversial artist Tracey Emin is believed to have actually shocked many of M&S’s traditionally conservative customers.

Ms Emin said when the campaign launched that she spent ‘half my life’ wearing M&S pyjamas, but to many she is most remembered for her  ‘My Bed’ art installation, which included condoms, a pair  of knickers and an empty cigarette packet.

Last month, M&S chief executive Marc Bolland denied reports that the new autumn range was make or break for the store after two years of declining sales.

He is understood to have insisted to investors that the campaign is working well and that more time is needed to revive the chain’s fortunes. A new internet strategy is being planned for next year.Industry insiders said the campaign is nevertheless seen as the benchmark against which he will be measured.

The survey supports concerns raised by City analysts last week over the success  of the new clothing ranges  at M&S.

The company declined to comment on the figures ahead of its crucial trading statement in three weeks’ time.

But brokers at Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are among those who believe  M&S will say next month  that fashion sales so far this year have been worse than  last year, before Mr Bolland’s latest turnaround plan was  set in motion.
