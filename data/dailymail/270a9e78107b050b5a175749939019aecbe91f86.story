The Wales midfielder, who is recovering from a slight hip problem, has just over two years left on his current terms but he is a player whom Brendan Rodgers wants to keep for the long-term.

Allen was one of Rodgers' first signings when he became Liverpool manager in 2012, having previously been a key figure for him at Swansea, and he has continued to fill an important role at Anfield.

Joe Allen is set to be offered a new long-term contract by Liverpool, with two years left on his current deal

Brendan Rodgers will be pleased to be extending the stay of a player that he brought with him from Swansea

He has 24 appearances so far this season for Rodgers' top-four chasing side and returns to his former club this weekend as Liverpool look to keep up their good form against Swansea.

He missed Liverpool's 0-0 draw with Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup on Sunday with a minor hip strain but is expected to return for the trip to the Liberty Stadium. 

Liverpool have won their last four Premier League games including an impressive 2-1 win over champions Manchester City this month.
