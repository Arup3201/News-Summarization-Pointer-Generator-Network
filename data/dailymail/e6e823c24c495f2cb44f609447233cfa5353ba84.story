A young doctor has been killed crossing the road outside her home after being hit by an ambulance during a weekend of carnage on New York's streets.

Samantha Lee, 26, an anaesthesiology resident at Columbia University Medical Center, had stepped into the road on West 96th Street when she was hit by an ambulance and crushed by another car.

She died at the scene shortly after 4.30am on Sunday morning. Neither of the drivers were charged with an offence.

The tragic incident was one of four fatal crashes involving pedestrians in a single weekend.

The shocking spate of accidents have prompted recently elected New York Mayor Bill de Blasio to vow to take action.

He has committed his administration cutting the number of traffic deaths, which he described as an 'epidemic', to zero.

Phillip Walzak, the mayor’s press secretary, said in an email on Sunday: 'These latest crashes underscore the urgent need to make our streets safer.'

Senior officials from health and police departments had convened a meeting on Friday to thrash out an action plan to cut the death toll.

These incidents are likely to put more pressure on authorities to put measures in place to make New York's streets safer.

Police officers have been carrying out a clampdown on jaywalking across the city.

Paying tribute to Ms Lee, Dr. Carolyn Kelly, associate dean for 
admissions and student affairs at the UCSD School of Medicine said: 'Samantha was an outstanding student 
whose warmth and compassion brightened the lives of her patients and our
 school community.'

George Engel, 65, a resident of Lee’s building, told the New York Post that he routinely crossed at the point where his neighbour was struck down.

'I cross here because otherwise I have to wait at the "don’t walk" for a ridiculous amount of time,' he said.

'Now
 that I know one of my neighbors was killed doing this, I don’t know. 
People fly down this block. They’re driving 50 miles per hour here.'

The day before Ms Lee's death, Angela
 Hurtado, 68, was killed as she crossed Grand Avenue at 69th Place in 
Queens about 11:20 am, police said. 

Five
 hours earlier a man, who had yet to be identified, was struck by a Ford
 Expedition in Queens, near Cross Island Parkway and Union Turnpike.

On Sunday morning about 1:30 a.m., a 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus hit a bicyclist, Pedro 
Santiago, 45, who was riding across West 125th Street near Lenox Avenue 
in Harlem;

The deaths have prompted the NYPD to step up enforcement of jaywalking laws near 96th Street and Broadway.
