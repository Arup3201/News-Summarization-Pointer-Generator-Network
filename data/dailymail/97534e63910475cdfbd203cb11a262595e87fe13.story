A British businessman has raised thousands of pounds to rescue a neglected tiger from a zoo in Greece.

David Barnes, who runs a bookshop in Uppingham, Leicestershire, has almost raised the £11,500 needed to save the 485lb tiger, called Phevos, from the cash-strapped zoo in the town of Trikala.

Phevos, who is 15 years old, has been alone in his enclosure since March, when his long-time companion Athena died after an infected wound on her paw went untreated.

Phevos, a 485lb 15-year-old tiger, was moved to Trikala zoo, in north-west Greece in 2001 after being rescued from an Italian travelling circus

After the financial crisis in Greece, he has received less care. Earlier this year his long-time partner, Athena, died after an infected wound on her paw went untreated

The tiger was rescued from a travelling Italian circus by the Greek authorities in 2001, and was taken to Trikala zoo, in the north-west of the country.

However, following the financial crisis, the condition of the zoo has deteriorated, leaving Phevos alone and in a 'poor' enclosure. 

Since then David Barnes, who used to work for the Animal Welfare Fund in Greece and has re-homed dozens of exotic animals in the past 20 years, has been trying to find a new home for the tiger. 

After months of fundraising, Mr Barnes, 62, has managed to get the money together to move Phevos to a sanctuary near San Diego, California. 

He said:  'When Phevos and Athena arrived at the zoo, the enclosure was not very good and I persuaded them to build a new one and things were going well.

'Then ... the financial crisis hit Greece and after that things changed.'

Former RSPCA inspector David Barnes, who runs a bookshop in Leicestershire, has raised nearly £11,500 - enough to move Phevos from the Greek zoo to an enclosure in San Diego, California

Former RSPCA inspector Mr Barnes lost track of the situation after having to undergo his second heart bypass operation.

He added: 'I got a phone call saying I should go and see Athena who was bleeding from a wound in her paw which had become infected. She died under anaesthetic.'

Mr Barnes swung into action and set up a fundraising website to spare Phevos a similar fate by raising £11,500 to transfer him to a sanctuary for lions, tigers and bears near San Diego, in California.

He added: 'Phevos is still in Greece but he is being checked on frequently by a vet friend and so far he is OK.

'I have raised just over £10,400 so just £1,100 to go. Whatever I'm short of will go on my credit card.'

He is now awaiting the paperwork to allow Phevos to be flown to California via Frankfurt, in Germany.

He added: 'I started applying to carry out the move in April and I'm hoping to go next month. It's the biggest and most challenging thing I've done.

'I will stay with him throughout the trip, he knows me very well, I am able to feed him and stroke him in his enclosure.

'I want him to go soon and start his new life, I know he'll be in good hands as the sanctuary he's going to was recommended to me by a vet.

'There's a 16-year-old female in the enclosure next to him where he's going, I hope they might get to like each other.'

Mr Barnes, who has a 23-year-old Greek cat, Naomi, which he calls his 'own little tiger,' said he was very grateful to everyone who responded to the appeal and helping with his mission to re-home Phevos.
