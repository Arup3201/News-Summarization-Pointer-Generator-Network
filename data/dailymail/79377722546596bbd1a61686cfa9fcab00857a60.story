It is said that to be a truly great photobomber you must first be an artist.

So in a year when the art of photobombing was added to the Oxford Dictionary ('a photograph that has been spoiled by the unexpected appearance of an unintended subject in the cameraâ€™s field of view as the picture was taken') it should come as little surprise that some of the best spoiled photos came from celebrities.

In Hollywood, photobombing has become a tit-for-tat game amongs the stars, especially at big awards events, when the opportunities to intrude a photo are endless in a sea of cameras.

Micro-blogging website Tumblr has developed a list of the best (read: funniest) photobombs of 2013.

Nice: Kelly Clarkson comes out of nowhere as a photographer takes a couples shot of Portia de Rossie and Ellen DeGeneres at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles on February 10

Tumblr has made it clear that the list is not final, as there are still a few more days to go until 2014.

So get bombing!
