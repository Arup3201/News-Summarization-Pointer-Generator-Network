Detectives investigating the death of a Jerry Springer producer's disabled sister now believe that she never wanted to commit suicide and was in fact murdered by her bankrupt sister, according to a shocking new report.

Jill Blackstone claims she was carrying out her sister Wendy's wishes for a suicide pact when Wendy, 49, suffocated to death March 14 in the garage of their Los Angeles home earlier this month. 

Jill told police she meant to die as well, but got cold feet and called a friend for help at the last second.

Now, detectives believe that Jill intended to murder her sister, who was deaf and partially blind, and that Wendy never agreed to a suicide pact, according to TMZ. 

The Daily Mail Online has previously reported that Jill Blackstone, a 52-year-old talk show producer who had worked on 'The Jerry Springer Show' and for Dr Drew, was drowning in $1.4million of debt and owed $122,000 to her sister Wendy. 

Police who responded to the scene arrested Jill Blackstone, 52, for murder, but later released her when the District Attorney ordered the case sent back to LAPD detectives for more investigation. 

Detectives determined early in the investigation that a suicide note that was supposedly written by Wendy had in fact been written by Jill, according to TMZ.

According to court documents filed three years ago, Jill Blackstone owed her sister Wendy $122,000. Wendy died in the garage of their $950,000 home in Studio City in Los Angeles

According to court documents Jill filed when she declared bankruptcy three years aog, she owed her sister $122,000 from a 2010 loan. 

She had more than $1.4million debts and about $700,000 in assets. 

The two sisters had recently sold their $950,000 home in Studio City in Los Angeles, but were still living in it while they waited for the new owners to take possession of the property and demolish it. 

The two sisters also ran a dog rescue agency to found homes for unwanted pets. 

Three of their dogs were found dead in the garage where Wendy was found dead from asphyxia.
