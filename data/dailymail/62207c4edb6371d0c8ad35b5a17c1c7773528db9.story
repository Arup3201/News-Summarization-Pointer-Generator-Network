Premier League striker Peter Crouch has been disqualified from driving for six months after clocking up 21 points on his licence.

In March his Range Rover was recorded travelling at 69mph in a 40mph zone and 70mph in a 40mph zone in April.

The 6ft 7in Stoke City star was automatically banned under totting-up procedures just weeks after appearing in court for other motoring offences.

Crouch, 31, was fined £1,300 by magistrates in Nuneaton, Warwickshire for two offences of failing to give police information relating to who was driving a Range Rover which was alleged to have exceeded the speed limit on the M42/M6 Toll Road at Curdworth in Warwickshire.

Crouch, of Mottram, Cheshire, who already had nine points on his licence, did not turn up for the hearing.

He was also ordered to pay £170 costs, with a £15 victim surcharge and had his licence endorsed with a further 12 penalty points.

In August, he was hit with five penalty points and a £1,000 fine after being caught speeding in Macclesfield after a match.
