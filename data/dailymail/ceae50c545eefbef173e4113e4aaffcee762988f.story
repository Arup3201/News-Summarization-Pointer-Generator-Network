Police hunting for a rogue Afghan policeman who shot dead an unwitting British soldier have arrested a suspect. 

Corporal Brent McCarthy, who was attached to the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, was gunned down while guarding a base in Lashkar Gar in Helmand Province. 

The 25-year-old died alongside Lance Corporal Lee Davies, 27, after they were shot by men dressed in Afghan police uniform in May 2012.

Chilling photographs emerged of the tragic British comrades smiling and posing with their killers just moments before they opened fire.

It has emerged the RAF policeman's parents have received news of one or more people being detained by Afghan authorities in connection with their son's murder

The man thought to have murdered Lance Corporal Davies was shot by a British soldier as he fled the compound and was later executed by Afghan police – but the second man escaped.

The wanted man's sponsor, who acted as his mentor in the Afghan police, was arrested last December and questioned as to the whereabouts of Corporal McCarthy's killer.

It has emerged the RAF policeman's parents have received news one or more people are being detained by Afghan authorities in connection with their son's murder. 

Sarah and John McCarthy, who live in Telford, Shropshire, are now waiting for news of any charges and say they want justice for their son.

Mrs McCarthy said: 'I believe they've caught him. I wanted to go out there and see him face-to-face. And I wanted him to face the death penalty in the beginning but I don't know now.

'Time has passed and you feel more controlled over your feelings.

'The main thing is to get justice for Brent now and to make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else.

'It's just a case of waiting for more information which is difficult.'

Cpl McCarthy's parents found out about the murder suspect's arrest in a letter from the British Army.

They have now given permission for a photograph of their son's body to be released to prosecutors in Afghanistan as evidence in the case.

The letter, sent from the Army Headquarters director of personal operations bereavement support, said: 'You may be aware there are a number of detainees being held by the authorities in Afghanistan for alleged crimes against members of our armed forces.

'Unfortunately it is extremely difficult to obtain accurate and detailed information from the authorities but there is evidence to suggest that one of more were involved in the shooting that killed your son Brent.

'Under the Afghan judiciary when criminal charges are made against these detainees it's essential for a photograph of the person killed to be presented in evidence to the courts.

'In order for this case to proceed it is intended to use photographs taken by the Royal Military Police at the time of the incident which is held on their files.'

Both soldiers were part of an eight-man team who had gone to the Afghan police base in the Lashkar Gah district of Helmand province on May 12.

The patrol had gone there so British officers could meet local police officials with RAF policeman Cpl McCarthy acting as a specialist adviser. 

During evidence at their inquest, it was heard the men were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

It also emerged there had been confusion on the day as to which of the men was acting as the 'guardian angel' to watch the Afghans.

Recording his verdicts, coroner for Oxfordshire Darren Salter said both men had, in the words of their patrol commander a Lt Benjamin Bardsley, performed 'phenomenally' on operations.
