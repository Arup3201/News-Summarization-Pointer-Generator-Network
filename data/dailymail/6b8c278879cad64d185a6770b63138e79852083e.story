He has stunned audiences with jaw-dropping stunts that defy logic and can make the most skeptical cynic believe in magic.

But in an daring new act, Bradford-born Illusionist Dynamo today took his impressive skills to even greater heights.

The 30-year-old entertainer took in London's sights by levitating beside the roof of a 15ft double-decker bus.

Smiling for the cameras, Dynamo, whose
 real name is Steven Frayne, travelled alongside the two-storey bus 
with the palm of his hand placed on the roof.

He hung in mid-air with his other arm
 outstretched as he crossed Westminister Bridge. A police escort cleared
 the way for Frayne's daring feat, ensuring there was no traffic around 
the bus.

Viewers of the magician's hit TV show
 are used to seeing him do the impossible, but lucky fans who were 
travelling in the bus looked on in amazement at the stunt.

People on the bus took pictures of the 'you have to see it to believe it' moment.

The trickster's levitating act, in partnership with Pepsi MAX had onlookers asking 'Where are the wires?'

It has to be seen to be believed: These amazing pictures, taken by fans from the street (left) and inside the bus (right) show the trick from different perspectivesÂ 

Thrilling: Smiling fans on the upper deck have a prime view of the stunt, which beggars belief

Astonishing: Dynamo stretches his left arm and his feet dangle in mid-air as the bus moves ahead

Perspective: A police escort ensured traffic was cleared around the vehicle for the amazing stunt

The
 entertainer is the new face of Pepsi Max and is fronting its Live for 
NOW campaign that will give hundreds of prizes away to customers.

Frayne's
 awad-winning show documents the tricks he has up his sleeve- from his 
mesmirising sleight of hand to his ability to walk on water.

He gained notoriety when he 'walked' across the Thames in 2011 to promote a new series of his show Magician Impossible.

Frayne has built his name on the celebrity circuit, astounding famous names with his tricks.

His
 previous tricks have included making Little Britain star Matt Lucas 
levitate before a live audience at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, and 
turning signed lottery tickets into cash in front of Robbie Williams and
 Davina McCall.

Acclaimed: Dynamo has baffled celebrity clients and industry experts with his skills. He was recognised by the magician's society, the Magic Circle, last year
