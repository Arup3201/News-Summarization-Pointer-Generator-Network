Hull pair Nikica Jelavic and Michael Dawson are set to miss up to six weeks with injuries sustained at the weekend.

Jelavic, the Tigers' four-goal joint top-scorer, injured his knee during the warm-up of Saturday's 2-2 draw against Arsenal, while Dawson was forced off late on with an ankle injury.

Both players underwent scans on Monday and the prognosis is that they will miss at least a month of action.

Hull Tweeted: 'Nikica Jelavic (knee) & Michael Dawson (ankle) will both be sidelined for 4-6 weeks with injuries suffered last weekend.'

There was also confirmation that goalkeeper Steve Harper has suffered a torn right bicep.

The 39-year-old was already deputising for Allan McGregor, meaning third choice Eldin Jakupovic - who came off the bench at the Emirates - is in line to start against Liverpool on Saturday.

'Scans of Steve Harper's shoulder injury have confirmed the club medical staff's diagnosis of a torn bicep tendon,' added Hull.

Hull will miss Dawson, who was a rock at the heart of their defence against Arsenal, for up to six weeks

Steve Harper's injury has yet to be fully assessed, but he has torn a ligament in his right bicep

'Steve will undergo further investigation once the swelling has settled.'

Jelavic's absence opens the door for the likes of Sone Aluko and Tom Ince to return after being pushed to the fringes in recent weeks, while Alex Bruce and Paul McShane are the defensive cover for Dawson.
