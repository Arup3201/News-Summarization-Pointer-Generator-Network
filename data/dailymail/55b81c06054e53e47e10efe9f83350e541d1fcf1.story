Oscar Pistorius is set to cash in on his notoriety as the killer of Reeva Steenkamp by writing a book about the night he shot her and the sensational murder trial that followed, his manager has confirmed.

News that the fallen South African hero is planning his own memoir of the Valentine's Day tragedy will undoubtedly heap fresh anguish on the dead model's already-tortured family.

The book – which would almost certainly bring film offers in its wake – is thought to be the easiest way in which the Paralympic gold medalist can raise much-needed funds to settle his legal costs.

Oscar Pistorius plans to write a book about the night he shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp, his manager said

Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide after shooting Reeva (left) through a bathroom door. He will be sentenced on October 13 

With his sentencing hearing still a month away, Pistorius, 27, is understood to have a shortfall in meeting bills submitted by his formidable legal team, even after liquidising his assets.

And if the state go ahead with an appeal against conviction or sentence – which seems increasingly likely given the growing backlash since Pistorius was cleared of murder – he is under pressure to build 'a war chest' to fund many more months or even years of legal battles.

His manager and close confidant Peet van Zyl told The Observer that he and the track star had spent the months leading up to his murder trial fleshing out a book proposal.

'He will write his own book,' Mr van Zyl confirmed. 'We've discussed it. We've talked about ideas and concepts.

'I will sit down with him once everything is done and decide what we are going to do. We have to wait until 13 October before we can think about anything. After that we will tell the world what we are going to do.'

There has been a massive international reaction to Pistorius' shock acquittal of the murder of his 29-year-old girlfriend, who died when he fired four bullets at her through the locked door of a tiny lavatory cubicle.

Peet van Zyl, Pistorius' manager, confirmed that they had sat down and discussed plans for the double-amputee to write a book about the night he shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp

Judge Thokozile Masipa accepted Pistorius' story that he fired repeatedly at the door, suspecting an intruder was behind it, and cleared him of murder

Judge Thokozile Masipa accepted Pistorius' story that he fired repeatedly at the door, suspecting an intruder was behind it. 

He was cleared of murdering Miss Steenkamp but convicted of culpable homicide.

He has been bailed until his sentencing, which was adjourned until October 13, with many experts saying a jail sentence is unlikely.

At the weekend, the sister of Nicole Brown - the wife of American football star OJ Simpson who was also dramatically cleared of her murder - drew her own painful parallels.

Simpson wrote the book If I Did It after he was acquitted of the murders of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman, who were killed in 1994. 

Denise Brown wrote in Time magazine: 'The Oscar Pistorius case reminds me so much of what happened to Nicole.

'We are seeing the same crimes, just different names, over and over again.'  

Miss Steenkamp's parents, June and Barry Steenkamp, were visibly emotional during the  hearing on Friday. June Steenkamp condemned the handling of the trial, saying she did not believe Pistorius' version of events

Following Pistorius' sentence, Reeva's mother, June Steenkamp, condemned the handling of the trial in an interview with NBC Today.

She said: 'I just don't feel that this is the right sentence. They believe his story - and I don't believe that story.

'There were so many mistakes made. It didn't add up.

'It was disbelief on our minds, it was disbelief on everyone in the world who has been following the case.

'I really don't what happens to Oscar. It's not going to change anything because my daughter's never coming back.

'He's still living and breathing. And she's gone forever.'
