Glen Turner was shot and killed on a property near Moree in northern NSW over an environmental dispute

The family of a 79-year-old Moree wheat farmer charged with murdering a state government worker said he had 'crumbled' under the pressure of an impending court battle over illegal land clearing.

Glen Turner was trying to issue Ian Robert Turnbull a notice for illegally chopping down trees on Tuesday. 

'A man was pushed beyond what he would have probably thought in his entire life he was ever capable of,' said members of Turnbull's family, who asked not to be named, reported The Daily Telegraph.

The family member said Mr Turnbull's one-year battle with the NSW Department of Environment and Heritage and the constant flow on inspectors on the property had encompassed his life and even affected his health.

The farmer was suffering depression, insomnia, high blood pressure and required a pacemaker as a result.

Mr Turnbull was refused bail on Wednesday and appeared at Moree Local court later in the day.

Mr Turner, 51, was working for the department and is survived by his wife Alison and their two children, aged nine and 10.

Mr Turnbull had previously been served notices by Mr Turner for illegally clearing vegetation on his property and in the Croppa Creek area.

The Land and Environment Court had ordered the farmer to remediate the land after it found the Native Title Vegetation Act had been breached.

In the wake of the tragedy, Mr Turnbull's family hope to see the legislation changed so farmers have more control over how they clear their land after persistent calls from farming communities.

The family member said Mr Turnbull was the 'respected elder' who people into the community turned too and not a 'hermit'.

'He was out in the community - he was helping to build old people's homes, he was collecting trampolines at school fetes, he did Meals on Wheels,' the family member told The Daily Telegraph.

'He has held this all in, he has crumbled, he has tried to carry this all to himself.'

The Turnbulls said the tragedy had catastrophic impacts for both families and offered their condolences to the Turners.

They added that the death was not right and Mr Turner's children had been robbed of their father. 

Police and paramedics were called to a Croppa Creek property about 55 kilometres north of Moree on the Newell Highway, where they found the body of the victim late on Tuesday afternoon.

A post-mortem will be held to determine exactly how the 51-year-old died. He was informing Mr Turnbull that there would be a formal inspection of his property in relation to the suspected illegally clearing of vegetation before the incident occurred.

Another worker was with the victim when he was shot, a department source who did not wish to be named said. The other worker is understood to be in shock but is otherwise uninjured.

Friends of the alleged shooter have described Mr Turnbull as even-tempered but admitted the whole town knew that he had cleared too many trees.

The wheat farmer owned five properties in the area and the shooting took place about a kilometre from one of those.

Moree Plains Shire mayor Katrina Humphries said the shooting highlighted the volatile issue of land clearing in northern NSW.

Environmental issues including land clearing and coal seam gas exploration have been a source of frustration in the rural community, she said.

'This is why I say, and I am not saying it flippantly and I mean it, I am not surprised this has happened,' she said.

'Because I know people have been pushed and pushed and pushed. This is their life and this is their livelihood,' Ms Humphries said.

Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce agreed with these comments, and said this was a tragedy but not an isolated incident, just the worst one.

Northern NSW ecologist Phil Spark said the farmer had cleared about 100 hectares of land.

'And a lot of that is koala habitat so that has been a real conflict between conservation and this farmer having the right to clear his land,' he told ABC Radio.

The NSW Public Service Association says the tragedy highlights the need for better risk assessment.

'The protection of the environment is an issue that generates great passion with strong feelings on both sides of the argument,' acting general secretary Steve Turner said in a statement.

NSW Environment Minister Rob Stokes said he was deeply saddened by the death.
