A trapped climber had to have his leg amputated after jamming his foot between rocks in a harrowing cliff-side scene reminiscent of the film 127 hours. 

Tsenolo Shadrack Rasello had his limb severed after getting stuck in a cave for almost 50 hours while hiking in  the dangerous Magaliesberg mountain range near Johannesburg in South Africa,

After calling for help from his mobile phone, rescuers were forced to perform the procedure on Sunday.

A climber had to have his leg amputated in a cave after becoming stuck in between rocks in the Magaliesberg mountain range near Johannesburg. A rescue worker lowers a stretcher to reach Tsenolo Shadrack Rasello

The Mountain Club of South Africa scrambled seven helicopters and a rescue team to help Mr Rasello when he called for help from his mobile phone 

After landing on the mountain late last Friday, the team abseiled down the cliff-side the following day to reach Mr Rasello who had not had any water for more than 24 hours

The 26-year-old was airlifted from the dangerous mountain range near Johannesburg after having his right leg amputated. He was in a stable condition in an intensive care unit this week 

His ordeal bears striking similarities with the story of Aron Ralston, the American climber whose decision to cut off his own forearm to escape from a Utah canyon while trapped inspired the Hollywood film starring James Franco. 

Seven helicopters were scrambled and more than 100 emergency service workers involved when Mr Rasello, 26, called for help from his mobile phone on Sunday. 

The 26-year-old had searching for 'holy water' in streams on the mountain range last Friday when he was startled by a snake and slid down in between two rocks. 

'There is no amount of explaining that can really explain the predicament this fellow was in,' said Rob Thomas of the Mountain Club of South Africa, who led the rescue team. 

'It was way, way, way worse than what I envisioned,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

After calling for help, the team arrived late on Friday but could not reach him until the following day, when they abseiled down the side of the mountain to find the man parched and 'terrified'. 

'Can I please, please, please have some water. I've had nothing to drink since yesterday morning,' is what the man, who is unemployed, first told rescuers.

Though weary after having been stuck for so long, the climber knew his only chance of survival was to have his leg amputated. 

''Listen, if you have to take the leg off, take the leg off. But get me out of here,'" is what he is said to have told the team. 

A trauma surgeon amputated his leg on Sunday with the help of anesthetist and paramedic, who stayed with the man for hours on the eve of the procedure. 

'I think he was terrified of being abandoned,' added Thomas.  

Frank Plani, the surgeon who carried out the operation, described conditions in the cave as 'unsteady'.

Mr Ralston was forced to cut off his arm after it became stuck between boulders while he was climbing in Utah in 2003. Here the adventurer bravely reconstructs the excruciating act 

'He was in a harness that allowed his body to be moved up and down a bit to facilitate the operation,' he said. 

Mr Rasello was taken to the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Johannesburg, where he was in a stable condition this week. 

While his ordeal is similar to that of Aron Ralston,  played by James Franco in the Hollywood sensation 127 hours, Rasello had the advantage of being able to call for help. 

Mr Ralston was forced to amputate his arm with a pocketknife after becoming trapped between boulders in southern Utah.
