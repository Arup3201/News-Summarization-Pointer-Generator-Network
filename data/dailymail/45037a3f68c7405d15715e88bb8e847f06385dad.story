Foul-mouthed parrot Beaky is being given etiquette lessons because his language is too rude for prospective pet owners

A foul-mouthed parrot that can’t be re-homed because it swears so much is having etiquette lessons.

Abusive Beaky has been stuck at an RSPCA rehoming centre since he was abandoned because his language is too rude for prospective pet owners.

The bird picked up the cluster of expletives from his previous owner and regularly blasts passersby as 'a*******' by calling them 'stupid'.

His language has become so bad that staff at RSPCA Leybourne Animal Centre in West Malling, Kent, have now called in an animal behaviour expert to improve his etiquette.

The specialist has begun a course of reward training where Beaky is given a treat every time he says a good word and gets nothing when he says a swear word.

An RSPCA spokeswoman said: 'We are doing reward training with Beaky so he learns what to say and what not to.

'Every time he says a pleasant word like “hello” we will give him a reward and when he says a naughty word we do not.

'We are looking for a new owner who can continue his etiquette training.

'Beaky is an intelligent and playful bird who is a good mimic.

'Unfortunately, this talent means that he picked up some rather colourful language from his previous home. He has quite a vocabulary and will certainly be a challenging house guest.'

The RSPCA said only people with experience and knowledge of exotic birds are wanted to re-home them.

Reward training: Beaky is given a treat if he says a good word and nothing if he says a bad word

Beaky was taken in by the RSPCA after his owner became too ill to care for him.

His species is Chattering Lories, a forest-dwelling parrot found in North Maluku, in Indonesia.

RSPCA spokesman Calie Rydings said: 'Beaky enjoys the company of people although he may bite at first until he has formed a bond with someone.

'He has always lived in a cage but may adapt to living in an aviary. If kept in a cage, he should be allowed out for safe flying time every day.'
