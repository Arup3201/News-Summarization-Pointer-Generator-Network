Scottish pensioners gain nearly £500-a-year by Scotland remaining in the Union, a study has found.

The report by Gordon Brown reveals that retired Scots receive a better share of pensions and benefits than the rest of the UK.

The former Labour Prime Minister argues that Scotland gets £9.6billion in pensions and old-age benefits annually, which is £500million more than the amount it would get if money was divided on the size on of its population.

His intervention comes as a separate report by MPs warns that Alex Salmond’s proposal for workers to retire earlier in Scotland than in the rest of the UK was ‘almost entirely uncosted’.

The study by the Scottish Affairs committee also accuses the Nationalist administration of ‘failing to acknowledge the costs and complexities of disentangling Scottish claimants from the UK welfare system’, and failing to explain how it would pay for shortfalls in public sector pension schemes. It will brand the SNP’s pensions policy as the ‘biggest mis-selling scandal in history’.

Mr Salmond and his ministers have vowed to consider raising the state retirement age to 66 in a separate Scotland, rather than 67 as planned by the UK Government, because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between £10,000 and £11,000 less on average.

Westminster has previously calculated that by 2030 the cost of such a policy would be as much as £800million-a-year with as many as 30,000 fewer people in work.

SNP ministers have also promised a state pension rise linked to whichever is highest - average wages, inflation, or 2.5 per cent.

This so-called ‘triple lock’ will cost no more than the UK Government’s commitment to increase the state pension in line with earnings, they claim.

But calculations by a major accountancy firms found that adopting the policy in an independent Scotland would cost £148million in 2019, rising to £272million in 2025.

Scotland’s pensioner population is expected to rise from 1.04million in 2010 to 1.49million in 2066. But the working age population is only expected to increase from 3.3million to 3.6million.

That will create a ‘dependency ratio’ of 2.41 workers for every pensioner, compared to 2.64 in other parts of the UK.

Mr Salmond’s proposed solution is to lift restrictions on non-EU immigration if he wins the referendum, with net migration levels of 24,000-a-year – equivalent to a city the size of Edinburgh in around 20 years.

But the committee’s report states: ‘Migration requires careful management, especially for its effects on public services, such as schools. Even the highest estimates of likely additional migration which we have seen… would be very challenging indeed to manage; and yet these levels are still not enough to address the affordability problems in relation to old age pensions which are thrown up by separation.’
