Ricky Gervais and Robin Williams provided the laughs while Bruce Springsteen and Roger Waters produced the riffs at the sixth annual Stand Up For Heroes benefit on Thursday night.

The four stars were performing alongside a host of other big names at the gig in New York to raise money for wounded veterans and their families.

Before going into the Beacon Theatre last night, Gervais told reporters: 'The bravest thing I do is tell some jokes, so it's pretty humbling. Being able to do this is very, very worthy... That and Bruce Springsteen. He's the Boss.'

Tee hee: Ricky Gervais, who performed at the sixth Stand Up For Heroes benefit, said he was humbled by the event. 'The bravest thing I do is tell some jokes,' he said

The real stars of the show: Gervais stands with Staff Sgt Robert Henline, left, who suffered burns over 38 per cent of his body following a roadside bombing north of Baghdad

Tina Fey and Amy Poehler have been confirmed as hosts of the 2013 Golden Globes, but when Gervais was asked about the awards, he said he 'might do them, I don't know.'

Meanwhile Kathy Griffin said as a female comedienne she had to bring her 'A game' when performing in front of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.

'It was really fun,' she added. 'The officers gave me all these rules and regulations which I quickly learned to ignore. Because if it's one things the troops like to hear it's dirty jokes and swearing.'

Griffin was then asked her opinion on Kim Kardashian's divorce. She joked: 'I love it, I wanna just thank her.'

Later Pink Floyd's Roger Waters took to the stage with 14 wounded soldiers he met recently at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C.

He rehearsed with them at the hospital, and for the past few days in New York.

The event benefited the Bob Woodruff Foundation, which helps returning veterans and their families.

Before the show, Waters chatted with veterans on the red carpet and called the experience 'fantastic'. He said he was 'looking forward to pulling for the rest of these guys with their comrades' during the healing process.

Golden Globes? Gervais, who took his partner Jane Fallon, left, to the benefit, told a reporter he 'might do' the 2013 Golden Globes,' adding 'I don't know'

He also revealed that he shares 'enormous empathy with the men'.

'I lost my grandfather in 1916 and my father in 1944, so I've been around the sense of loss and what loss from war can do to people,' Waters said.

'I never talk about the politics because it's not relevant to me. I'm not interested in it. What I am interested in is the burdens these guys bear and would never question motive or even dream of talking about any of the politics.'

He added: 'If any of us have a responsibility in our lives it is to tear down the walls of indifference and miscommunication between ourselves and our fellow men.'

Ha ha, very funny: Mike Birbiglia, left, and The Daily Show's Jon Stewart perform during the gig in New York on Thursday night

Before the show, he walked the red carpet with Staff Sgt Robert Henline, who was not in the band. In 2007, Henline was the sole survivor of a roadside bombing north of Baghdad.

As a result, he suffered burns over 38 per cent of his body and his head was burned to the skull.Henline, who fought for his life after the attack, has endured more than 40 surgeries.

Still, he maintains a sense of humour. On the open red carpet on a chilly night, Waters pushed closer to Henline for warmth.

'Get next to the burn guy. I'm good. I'm heated up,' Henline joked.

The retired soldier said he has been trying his hand at stand-up comedy for the past year and a half.

Waters performed three songs with the veterans, including the Pink Floyd classic, Wish You Were Here.

He also quashed hopes of a reunion with his former band.

He said: I think David (Gilmour) is retired by and large. I shouldn't speak for him. But that's the impression I get.'

Waters added: 'Hey whatever. All good things come to an end.'

The Bob Woodruff Foundation has supported more than one million veterans, service members, and their families since it began in 2008.
