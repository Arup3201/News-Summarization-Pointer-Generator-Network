An Ohio woman is in jail after she allegedly stabbed her twin sister in the chest during a fight over an apple fritter.

Contisha Hayes, 21, and her sister, 
Tamara Delaney, 21, were in the kitchen cooking the fritter when they 
'started to play fight' over the treat, investigators say.

However, the joke quickly turned serious when Delaney pulled Hayes' hair prompting an angry response. She allegedly took out a knife and stabbed her sister in the chest in retaliation.
