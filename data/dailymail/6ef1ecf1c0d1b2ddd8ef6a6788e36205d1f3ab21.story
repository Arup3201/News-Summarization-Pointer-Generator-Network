Halloween is almost upon us, when parents dig out some old bed sheets for their child to do the Trick or Treat rounds as a ghost. 

In the last few years, October 31 has become almost as big an occasion in Britain as it is in the US, with themed food and decorations filling the aisles at supermarkets across the country. 

And the latest spooky export to the UK from across the Atlantic will have your little ones quaking in fear - not the children, we mean the family dog. 

Online stores have thousands of options for dogs, hamsters and cats this Halloween. Femail has rounded up some of the best, including this Katy Perry California Girl dog costume £14.99 and Holy Hound dog costume £15.99  (plus P&P) both from Escapade  

Websites are offering a huge number of themed costumes for any domestic animal, whether it's small like a hamster or guinea pig, or a fully-grown Labrador. 

Popstars like Madonna, Katy Perry and Elvis feature heavily on the fancy dress websites because of their easily recognisable stage costumes.

Elsewhere, the nautical theme is the most popular, with pirates and shark outfits coming in a range of styles and sizes. 

The narrowest category, unsurprisingly, is the clothing range for cats, which could easily be the most difficult family pet to dress up. 

For that reason, most feline fancy dress centres around a simple cap, or woolly hat.
