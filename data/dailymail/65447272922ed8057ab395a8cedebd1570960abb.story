Regina perfectly captures the attitude of many towards Halloween in her famous Mean Girls line

'Halloween is the one night of the year a girl can dress like a slut and no one can say anything about it!'

This line, uttered in the cult film Mean Girls by Regina George, perfectly encapsulates the attitude of many towards Halloween.

Originally a pagan festival influenced by Christianity, Halloween's adoption by America saw the mass commercialisation of the day, with things like trick-or-treating and pumpkin carving being invented. But over the last few decades it has become increasingly sexualised - particularly women's costumes. 

Research has found that 51 per cent of Britons think that Halloween costumes on sale aimed at women are over-sexualised, and, more worryingly, the majority of people (69 per cent) think that children’s Halloween costumes on sale are not age appropriate. 

Even avoiding specifically 'adult' themed Halloween costumes, a brief look across nearly all retailers shows that most women's costumes involve a short skirt or plunging neckline and are often pushing the boundaries of modesty. 

However, and perhaps unsurprisingly, 58 per cent of men did not think women’s Halloween costumes were over-sexualised, but two thirds of women felt the opposite.

There was a clear age divide of opinions of the current state of Halloween attire, with the majority (76 per cent) of those aged over 55 feeling that the costumes on sale for children were not age appropriate but thirty four percent of 18 to 24 years olds had no problem with the clothing on sale for children.

In general, parents are not impressed with children’s Halloween costumes on sale, with 83 per cent finding them to be inappropriate for the age at which they are marketed.

Mark Pearson, founder of My Voucher Codes, who commissioned the study, commented on the findings: 'Halloween is meant to be a time where you dress up in scary costumes, not sexy. Our results show that many women feel that the choice available to them is not equal to men’s choices with the main focus of the outfit being sexy rather than scary.'

He added: 'We can see that some outfits on sale for children are also inappropriate for the age ranges the clothes fit. Whether they are a scary film character a child should not know about or a rather revealing outfit for a young girl. Obviously many parents feel the same, which is why it is important to push for more family friendly costumes this Halloween.'

Parenting blogger Clare from www.emmysmummy.com has been in search of Halloween outfits but tells FEMAIL she has struggled to find an outfit which is scary rather than sexy: 

Searching the supermarkets was my first thought however my local one only has children's outfits which forced me online. Now I made the mistake of doing this with Emmy.....I'm not sure if you've searched for 'Women's Halloween dressing up outfits' yet... It's eye opening that's sure. Now try that search and pull up the images instead as I did.

Apart from a few exceptions I could see (as could my 4 year old daughter) anything and everything seems to go as a Halloween outfit, and it seems the tighter, shorter and low cut the better. Now I'm no proud and have been to an adults only dressing up party before so have worn these types of outfits in the past; but what about family dressing up parties?

Searching through eBay seems to bring up the worst culprits - nearly all of those are boob tubes and only just cover your knickers - not something I would wear in front of children or with children around. They wouldn't be out of place in an Ann Summers catalogue!!

Heading to a fancy dress costume website I thought I may find more choice but actually they weren't that much better - if you look in the women's section they too are tight fitting and really short or even the long ones have high splits up the legs and low cut busts to them.

One of the better costumes Clare managed to find

This is one of the better costumes I managed to find. Now there isn't actually anything wrong with it at all however I'm not really sure I want my daughter to see me in it either. At the age of 4 she is very impressionable as are all young girls. So why do we need to have only sexy style costumes available to us women?

Thankfully when looking for costumes for my daughter I have found them to be very appropriate and I am actually spoilt for choice in her outfits. I think it's actually very cute to see the children all dressed up in their witches outfits with their broomsticks and hats.

I just really wish that I was able to join my daughter, however to date I've not found a witches outfit which isn't either short enough to just about cover my knickers and would require me to wear thermal tights (It's October and freezing after all) or leggings to cover my pride, or which requires the tops of my legs to be shaven - I've said before, It's October and freezing!!

Why do witches all have to be sexy? I'm sure in the story books they aren't or in the horror movies!
