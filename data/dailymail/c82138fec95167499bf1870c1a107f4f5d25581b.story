Since the 1930s it has been an iconic part of the South London skyline, appeared on a Pink Floyd album cover and in several films.

Now investors into an £8bn project to develop Battersea Power Station are allowing a sneak preview of what the multibillion-pound development will look like in a bid to attract the best businesses and retailers - and heading out on a 'global tour' to promote them.

The project will see the 42-acre former 
brownfield site transformed into homes, shops, cafes, offices and public
 space, including the restoration of the Grade II-listed power station.

Foreign investors have been given a sneak preview of what the multibillion-pound development at the iconic Battersea Power Station will look like

The £8 billion project, backed by a consortium of Malaysian investors, will see the 42-acre former brownfield site transformed into homes, shops, cafes, offices and public space, including the restoration of the Grade II-listed power station

Shareholders and representatives behind the redevelopment will market the project to 13 cities in 11 countries in October and November to find UK and global brands, businesses and restaurants to take up residence at the landmark London site.

Announcing the global tour, Battersea Power Station Development Company chief executive Rob Tincknell said it was vital to get the ingredients right for the 'cocktail' that will form the huge development.

Building work began in July 2013 - the building's 80th anniversary - with the overall development hoped to be completed in 2025 and the power station itself open to the public for the first time in more than 30 years in 2019.

The project is divided into seven phases, each designed by specialist architects including award-winning Frank Gehry, and once complete the development is expected to see 25,000 people living and working on site, with 40 million visits anticipated each year.

Mr Tincknell said the global tour was about finding the best overseas occupants for the site, as well as the best of British.

He said: 'Because it's a mix of uses it will become much more attractive to a wider group of potential investors and occupiers.

'We want the best local tenants, the best British tenants, but we want the best international occupiers too.

'It's a carefully-curated cocktail of different uses - the offices are really important, the retail is extremely important, and the residential aspect is really important, and if we don't get each individual part right the other parts will suffer.

'That cocktail isn't going to taste right if you're missing a vital ingredient.'

Mr Tincknell said the project was going 'extraordinarily well' with more than 1,100 apartments already sold. He said there was clear support from the public and urged any critics to come and 'see for themselves'.

'The residential sales that we have done have been extraordinarily successful. We've had more demand than any scheme in London has ever achieved before,' he said.

'This is a valuable investment - the commercial space at Battersea Power Station creates something like 15,000 jobs for London, it creates £1 billion of income for the British Government.

'This is an inward investment story for London. It's the total opposite of any idea of creating a "ghost town".

'The proof is in the pudding. We have already seen the public supporting us. We understand what makes a large mixed-use project, we're delivering that and it's being supported.'

Mr Tincknell said his position at the helm of the 'Everest of real estate' had become more of a 'quest' than a job.

During the tour, which will see exhibitions in London, Kuala Lumpur, New York, Dubai, Paris, Los Angeles, Milan, Tokyo, Beijing, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Doha, developers will be looking for businesses to lease the 3.5 million sq ft of commercial space

'It's a privilege to be leading the scheme and an absolute joy to be working with shareholders who really understand what makes a complex project like this work and have demonstrated such enormous commitment to London.

'They have done something which no other developer was ever able to do - they have unlocked Battersea Power Station.'

'It's a challenge; we're not there yet, but we're extremely confident we're going to get there.

'The challenge is to maximise the opportunity because we can do things with this site that we couldn't do anywhere else in the world.

'I honestly believe it would be remiss of us as developers if we didn't take that opportunity.'
