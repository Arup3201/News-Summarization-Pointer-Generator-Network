The last time Paul Walker talked with his father, he promised to give up his daredevil ways.

In an interview with E! Online, Paul Walker Senior talked about the last conversation with his actor son who died in a fiery car crash in Los Angeles on Saturday.

'I said, "Promise me, no more daredevil stuff." I said, "If in your heart, you say, I can do this, then by all means, do it. If your mind says, maybe not. Then don't." I looked at him, I said, 'Will you promise me that?"'

Mr Walker believes he got through to his self-confessed 'adrenaline junkie' son. According to his official Twitter account, he was an 'outdoorsman' and 'ocean addict'.

'I said, "You know, promises are a very important thing here, Paul." I said, "Say OK," and he said "OK". You know, a lot of us, sometimes we make promises and get caught up in the moment and stuff like that, but I can tell I got to him,' Mr Walker said. 'I can tell that I was very serious. Sometimes sons think of their fathers and their grandfathers as these bigger than life people.'

Mr Walker also talked about how his son was always uncomfortable with fame, and how the media attention surrounding his death would have made him uneasy.

'It was embarrassing to him,' he said. 'I thought last night, "Paul would be embarrassed of this." And I looked up at the sky, and I said, "Well, tough luck pal."'

Walker became famous for his role in 
the Fast and Furious movie franchise, which depicted the underground 
world of illegal street racing.

Walker wasn't actually behind the wheel of the cherry red Porsche when it hit a pole and exploded.

According to an autopsy, Walker survived the crash but died when he was burned alive in the following explosion.

His friend Roger Rodas, died on impact.

Walker leaves behind a 15-year-old daughter, Meadow, who he had with ex-girlfriend Rebecca Soteros.

Tragically, Meadow had recently moved to LA to live with her father after being raised in Hawaii by her mom.

Walker was just getting used to being a dad when his life suddenly ended.

In
an interview with Salon Magazine while shooting Fast & Furious 7, 
he admitted being 'torn' between work and family life, saying 'I'm 
excited for the work. My daughter is 15. I go home every weekend.

'She's the best thing I have right now. It's a real healing time for both of us, so it's finding the right balance. You can reinvent yourself, but inside, there's truth to the noise. I may miss out on the best moments of my life, so it's maintaining the balance. I don't have to work if I don't want to, but I love the work,' he said.

Walker's father said he having a 'real hard time talking with Meadow' and that all he's been able to do so far is give her a hug and a kiss.

'It's hard to get to Meadow because she's got do many people close to her that are loving her and we want that,' he said.
