Senate Democrats won a squeaker of a victory in a procedural vote aimed at extending unemployment benefits for millions of Americans on Tuesday, as President Barack Obama was preparing to complain that Republicans in the House of Representatives plan to block the measure.

The legislative proposal would continue federal jobless benefits for an extra three months, at a cost of $6.4 billion.

The 60-37 Senate vote was an unexpected victory for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who managed to attract the support of six Republicans. He hopes to pass the measure by the end of the week.

Democrats needed 60 'aye' votes to end debate and authorize a final vote. Tuesday's preliminary roll call was delayed a day to allow a dozen senators to return to Washington amid nationwide air traffic chaos caused by an historic cold weather snap.

White House National Economic Council Chairman Gene Sperling told reporters on Monday that the nation faces a 'long-term unemployment crisis' that requires 'emergency' action.

That plea came just 17 days after 
Obama told reporters in an end-of-year press conference that his administration has done a
 remarkably good job putting jobless Americans back to work.

 Republicans still plan to push back against the unemployment benefit 
extension, insisting that the White House-backed measure's steep cost 
must be offset by spending cuts elsewhere.

Obama insisted Tuesday that giving 
unemployed Americans three extra months of benefits 'should be the first
 order of business in 2014.'

'We need the House of Representatives to be able to vote on it as well,' he said.

He was introduced by Katherine Hackett, an unemployed Connecticut woman whose benefit checks, the a White House official said, cover her mortgage payment and health care, leaving little to pay for the rest of her expenses.

'Job loss is devastating, and I am working hard every day to find a position,' she said Tuesday at the White House. 'In the interim, unemployment benefits have been absolutely essential to cover my bare necessities.'

Neither the White House nor Hackett identified her profession, but she insisted that she has applied for every opportunity for which she qualifies.

Obama argued that at least 1.3 million Americans are waiting for immediate help, and a total of 14 million stand to lose benefits this year.

'This insurance helps keep food on the table while Dad is sending out resumes,' he said, and 'we know that "there but for the grace of God go I."'

Senate Republicans who opposed Tuesday's test vote said that without support in the House, Tuesday's initial salvo was merely symbolic. 

'It is transparent that this is a political exercise, not a real effort to try to fix the problem,' said Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn.

Another Republican, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, hinted in a floor speech that a final vote could face opposition over the Affordable Care Act.

He insisted Tuesday that the price of more Republican support would be the elimination of Obamacare's so-called 'individual mandate,' an ultimatum that Democrats rejected as hard-hearted and senseless.

'Thatâ€™s the Republican logic,' Illinois Democratic Senator Dick Durbin mocked during a floor debate: 'Help the unemployed but at the expense of 300 million Americans.'
