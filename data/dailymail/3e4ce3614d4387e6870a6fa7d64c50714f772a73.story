The All Blacks were put through their paces during a training session at Murrayfield as they prepare to defend one of rugby's most one-sided records against Scotland on Saturday.

New Zealand have never lost to their hosts in 29 meetings since playing their very first Test in 1905 - while a 25-25 draw at Murrayfield in 1983 is the closest the Scots have come to threatening that statistic.

Coach Steve Hanson watched over his players having made a surprising number changes to the side that educated England during their a 24-21 victory in last week's second autumn international.

New Zealand: Ben Smith, Colin Slade, Malakai Fekitoa, Ryan Crotty, Charles Piutau, Dan Carter, T.J. Perenara; Joe Moody, James Parsons, Charlie Faumuina, Jeremy Thrush, Dominic Bird, Richie McCaw (captain), Victor Vito, Sam Cane.

Reserves: Dane Coles, Wyatt Crockett, Ben Franks, Luke Romano, Liam Messam, Augustine Pulu, Sonny Bill Williams, Julian Savea.

Only captain Richie McCaw and Ben Smith have retained their places, although both will play in different positions against the Scots. McCaw will start on the blindside flank for the first time, and Smith has moved from the wing to fullback.

However, the biggest talking point has been the the return of  Dan Carter - who will start a Test for the first time in a year. The influential fly-half last started a Test against England last November before taking the next seven months off - and his planned return was set back when he broke his leg in the Super Rugby final.

Meanwhile, Scotland's New Zealand coach Vern Cotter insists his home country's run will not go on forever and is now dreaming Saturday will be finally be Scotland's day.

Speaking ahead of the Test, Cotter said: 'The record against New Zealand has been spoken about around the place. The only thing we have control of, however, is the instant.

'The past has no bearing over what we are doing. We are not bothered about what has happened before.

'We don't need to worry about the future either. All we need to do is focus fully on this match and concentrate on each instant as it passes.

'It's the here and now that counts.

'If we give 100 per cent against the All Blacks during those instances then you never know.'
