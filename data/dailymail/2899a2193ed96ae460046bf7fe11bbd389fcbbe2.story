A 35-year-old University of Pittsburgh Medical Center researcher found dead at work earlier this month was killed by cyanide poisoning, it was revealed today. 

Allegheny County Medical Examiner Dr. Karl Williams says his office has yet to determine whether Nicole Kotchey's death was a suicide, a homicide or an accident.

Williams and UPMC spokeswoman Susan Manko say Pittsburgh police are still investigating the circumstances surrounding Kotchey's sudden passing at Magee Womens Hospital of UPMC November 12.

Poisoned: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center researcher Nicole Kotchey, 35, died as a result of exposure to cyanide earlier this month, an autopsy showed 

Sudden passing: Kotchey collapsed at work and died four hours after her colleagues found her lying unresponsive on the floor

Kotchey, of Ross Township, was a medical researcher at the Pittsburgh hospital.

Kotchey's death came a week after another former UPMC medical researcher, Dr. Robert Ferrante, was convicted of first-degree murder in the April 2013 cyanide poisoning death of his wife, Dr. Autumn Klein. 

Dr Klein was a neurologist also employed by UPMC. There are no indications at this time that the two cases are related.

Miss Kotchey collapsed at work on the morning of November 12 and was found lying on the floor in front of her desk at around 8.30am. About four fours later, Kotchey was pronounced dead.

Mystery: Investigators are not sure at this time whether Kotchey's death was a homicide, a suicide or an accident

'It was a mystery death that very rapidly evolved into having some kind of concern of cyanide,' Karl Williams told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.  

Pittsburgh Police Lt. Daniel Herrmann told the newspaper that homicide detectives will now begin an 'in-depth investigation,' looking into the researcher's past for clues. 

Ms Kotchey is survived by her parents, David and Michelle, and her brother, Gregg.
