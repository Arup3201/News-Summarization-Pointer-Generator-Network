The latest Diet Coke advert, released to to celebrate 30 years of the drink, has certainly set temperatures soaring and launched British model Andrew Cooper's career as TV dreamboat.

Now the fizzy drinks brand has released an exclusive video of the making of the advert, giving his growing legions of fans the opportunity to get to know him a little better.

The clip, cheekily titled ‘Undressing Andrew Cooper’, follows the model and the production team on the day of the shoot.

Andrew has, unsurprisingly been setting pulses races since the advert, which brought back the 'hunk' to celebrate 30 years of Diet Coke, was released

The behind the scenes video shows that getting Andrew wet in exactly the right way was no mean feat

In the short film the 31-year-old from Manchester talks about being cast in the iconic role of Diet Coke ‘hunk’: '‘I was really happy, I was just thrilled,’ says Andrew.

‘It was a job I really wanted. It’s a really iconic brand and a really big deal.’

The advert is titled ‘The Gardener’ in keeping with the previous Diet Coke ‘hunk’ adverts (the last one was titled ‘the Window Cleaner') and sees a group of picnicking women playfully role a diet coke down the grassy hill to Andrew, who they spot mowing the lawn.

When he opens the it to take a sip the can, shaken from it’s roll, explodes over him.

The women are then left open–mouthed when the ‘gardener’ swiftly deals with his soaking top by removing it, revealing a very chiseled torso, before sauntering off into the sunshine.

It appears drenching Andrew with the Diet Coke was no easy feat, and the behind the scenes video shows various shots of the hunky model opening the can with a hose attached, and being sprayed in a combination of ways to get just the right shot.

The video also reveals that it is not just 
normal girls who are drooling over Andrew as Lean, one of the models in the advert admits: ‘It 
has made acting slightly easier, because it is rather believable. He is 
something nice to look at.’

At one point all the models can be seen huddled round a screen in between takes in order to try and catch a glimpse of the shots of Andrew stripping off his damp T-shirt.

Neil Dawson, the executive creative director of BETC London, the agency behind the advert, said: 'This year we are creating work to celebrate 30 years of diet coke and we are reintroducing its most famous ambassador; the diet coke hunk.

'Casting Andrew was a lengthy and quite difficult process. We used the late 20s early 30s female members of the agency as a good bench mark of who might appeal.

'The number of nose marks on the outside of the glass window of the meeting room when Andrew was the screen was a good indicator!’
