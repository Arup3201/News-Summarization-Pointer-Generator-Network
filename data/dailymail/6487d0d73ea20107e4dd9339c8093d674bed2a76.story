A man who claims to be a missing telephone worker who vanished in 1990 is set for a court battle with the missing man's wife over his $300-a-month pension.

Kwame Seku, 65, says that he was stricken with amnesia and found himself wandering the streets of San Diego with only a few dollars in his pocket and no idea who he was.

But after years of searching, he claims he has realized his true identity - Winston Bright, a New Yorker and father of three who vanished for no reason.

Dead or alive: Kwame Seku claims that he is Winston Bright, a telephone worker whom a New York court declared dead in 2000

Seku, who adopted his current name after reading it in a magazine, built a new life in California but says he would occasionally remember fragments of his previous existence.

He found out about Bright online and, he claims, realized that he was the man in question - despite the fact that a Manhattan court declared Bright dead in 2000.

The declaration allowed Bright's widow, Leslie Bright, to collect her husband's pension from Verizon, with whom he had 20 years' service.

Winston Bright went missing on October 12 1990. Bright recalled her husband calling her up from work at lunchtime, and again on he was home. But he never arrived.

According to Seku's claims, his memory around that time is a complete blank, and his first clear recollection is finding himself wandering in California.

A judge there granted him a new identity. He qualified as a teacher and worked until his retirement, before remember his past life.

Now Seku wants the court to affirm his identity so he can claim the Verizon pension for himself after discovering his past life - and the issue is set to be decided in court after his wife contributes to the case, the New York Daily News reported. 

Seku tried to overturn the declaration of death before and have himself recognized as Winston Bright - but the case was thrown out because he had no way to prove it.

But, Seku claims, since then blood tests comparing his DNA with that of Bright's mother and his adult children have proved the link.

However, in a court hearing Friday, Bright slammed her alleged husband as a 'scammer' who never attempted to provide any proof. Her children appeared to back up her claims.

Judge Rita Mella of Manhattan Surrogate Court said that Bright has until November 14 to file a formal objection to Seku's request, which can then be officially decided.
