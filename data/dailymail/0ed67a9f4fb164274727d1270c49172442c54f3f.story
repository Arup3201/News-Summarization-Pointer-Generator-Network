Inter Milan are showing interest in Liverpool's Brazilian midfielder Lucas Leiva.

The 27-year-old has been at Anfield since 2008 but made just 29 appearances last season due to a combination of injuries and being left out by manager Brendan Rodgers.

He has 24 Brazil caps but was left out of Luis Felipe Scolari's squad for the World Cup on home soil.
