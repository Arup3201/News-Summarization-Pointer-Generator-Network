Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League and Football League this week, including why Steven Gerrard is the set-piece master.

1) Everybody remembers Steven Gerrard for the 'Take a Bow Son' last minute goal against Olympiakos, and his equally dramatic equaliser that sunk West Ham in the 2006 FA Cup Final. 

Those type of stunning strikes from open play are becoming a thing of the past, however. 

His coolly taken spot kick against Tottenham at White Hart Lane meant that only one of his last 18 goals for Liverpool have not been either free kicks or penalties. 

The odd one out was last season's header from a Luis Suarez corner that kicked off the 4-0 win over Everton at Anfield.

2) Nemanja Matic appears to have turned over a new leaf when it comes to discipline this season. 

The Serbian midfielder was the man playing peacemaker at Goodison, dragging Diego Costa away from trouble after he had riled Everton's defenders by gloating about Seamus Coleman's own goal. 

Matic certainly needed to sort out his behaviour. He collected a red card plus 13 yellows in each of his last two seasons.

New role: Nemanja Matic has become the peacemaker at Chelsea this season

3) Steven Caulker's pace will be vital for Queens Park Rangers alongside 35-year-old Rio Ferdinand – especially with another veteran in Richard Dunne as Harry Redknapp's alternative defensive option. 

Caulker, trying to recover the form that brought him an England cap in 2012, was one of only two central defenders in Saturday's Premier League games to register a top sprinting speed of 20mph or more as he helped Rangers register their first clean sheet of the season.

Pace: Steven Caulker was one of only two Premier League defenders to get above 20mph this weekend

4) Aston Villa teenager Jack Grealish is already getting a reputation as a danger man – and he hasn't made his full Premier League debut yet. 

Hull were so worried about the 18-year-old's tricky dribbling ability when he came on as a late sub they had Nikica Jelavic, Ahmed Elmohamady and Stephen Quinn all booked for crunching tackles on him in the space of five minutes.

5) Antonio Valencia is struggling to handle the defensive side of his new role as a wingback – and the extra workload is leaving him too puffed out for his attacking play too. 

The 29-year-old got forward often enough to put in 12 crosses at Burnley, but not a single one of them was accurate enough to create a goalscoring chance. 

Valencia and Ashley Young were United's top two players for the number of sprints they made, but Young also failed to set up a single opportunity.

Hard work: Antonio Valencia is struggling in defence for Manchester United, and is too worn out to attack

6) James Ward-Prowse is in Gareth Southgate's Under 21 squad this week, but could be the next graduate of the Southampton academy to force his way through to senior England honours. 

The teenager bossed the midfield at West Ham, setting up one goal and making five more chances for team mates before he was subbed with 19 minutes left. He also had two attempts on goal of his own, and found a team mate with 44 out of 49 passes.

7) Kenny Jackett took over a club in chaos when he walked into Wolverhampton Wanderers last summer, so it is hardly surprising that stability is one of his watch words now. 

Jackett has kept the same line-up for all the first five of Wolves' Championship games so far, and a comfortable 3-1 win over Blackburn proved the policy is paying benefits.

8) Jermaine Beckford has found it tough to be accepted by Bolton fans since his move from Leicester, and manager Dougie Freedman has been forced to defend him against critics on a number of occasions. T

he 30-year-old made things worse for himself by waving at Leeds supporters who cheered him when he got brought on as a 77th minute sub in the 1-0 defeat. 

Beckford, of course, was a big hit at Elland Road scoring 85 goals in 152 games between 2006 and 2010.

9) Any other League One club might have been stung by selling their 26-goal top scorer just days before the transfer deadline – but Bristol City look capable of surviving the loss of Sam Baldock to Brighton. 

After signing 34-year-old Aaron Wilbraham, boss Steve Cotterill has even been able to keep Jay Emmanuel Thomas, who got 23 last season, on the bench. JET, as he likes to call himself, is likely to get his chance now. 

The 23-year-old former Arsenal trainee came on as a late sub before slotting a cool last minute penalty to earn a 2-1 win at Notts County.

10) Micky Mellon was the manager who took Fleetwood from the bottom of the Conference North all the way into the Football League – only to get sacked 18 months ago the first time he suffered a few bad results. 

The 42-year-old Scot is proving his worth again in his new job as boss of Shrewsbury – following the midweek Cup giant-killing at Premier League Leicester with a 2-0 win over Luton that put his unbeaten side fourth in the table. 

Mellon made only one change from the side that won at the King Power Stadium – and that forced on him by Andy Mangan's hamstring injury – but made sure that nobody still had their minds on the Cup success.
