A woman who was snatched as a baby 26 years ago and raised by her kidnapper has revealed that her life is all the better for it.

Netty Nance, who was just 19 days old when she was stolen from a Harlem Hospital, was reunited with her real mother in 2011, having managed to solve the case on her own.

However, rather than harboring feelings of anger and bitterness about the deception, she says that she wouldn’t change what happened.

How it was reported: A New York Post story about the kidnapping

Netty told the Daily Mirror: ‘Now I have two moms and two dads and my life is richer now because of that. I feel as though everything happens for a reason.

‘I wouldn’t be me, if it wasn’t for what I’ve been through, and I’m happy. I wouldn’t change what happened to me.’

Netty’s remarkable story begins in 1988 in New York.

Her real mom was Joy White, who gave birth to her at 16 and called her Carlina. But after just 19 days Carlina developed a fever so Joy and the father, Carl Tyson, 22, took her to Harlem Hospital.

The kidnapper, Ann Pettway, struck when they went home to collect some belongings, Carlina having been left in a cot.

Ann, from Connecticut, had been posing as a nurse on the maternity ward for many weeks - and so effectively that many of the nurses there thought she was genuine.

She had recently had a miscarriage and she saw Carlina as a chance for happiness.

Joy and Carl were horrified when they discovered their baby was missing.

A massive police hunt got underway, but despite wanted posters for a woman matching Ann's description, the crime remained unsolved for the next 23 years.

Carlina was renamed Nejdra Nance, which became Netty after a move to Atlanta, Georgia.

Ann had a son when Netty was 10, called Trevon, and they had a happy family life for many years.

Netty recalls learning dance steps with her cousins and lots of family picnics and birthday parties.

‘I have more good memories than bad from that time,’ she said.

However, in 2005, her world was sent into a spin.

She had a child of her own and had to present her birth certificate to officials to claim prenatal care.

But she was told her birth certificate was forged.

In a state of shock she confronted Ann, who broke down and confessed that she wasn’t her real mom.

It made sense to Netty as she had begun to notice that she didn’t share physical traits with Ann.

But Ann lied and told her that she’d been abandoned by a drug addict.

Netty moved into her own apartment after she gave birth to a girl, called Samani, and became determined to find out more about her past.

Carlina, now known as Netty, was abducted during a stay at Harlem Hospital, when she was admitted with a fever

After five years of research she discovered her real identity through the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children’s website.

She found a picture of herself as a baby that looked just like Samani and the shocking truth of what had happened dawned on her.

DNA tests confirmed that Joy and Carl were her real parents and she was joyously reunited with them.

She describes her relationship with them as ‘incredibly close’, though it did take a while for her to come to terms with her new life, admitting that she hid away and barely spoke to her friends for over a year after the truth was revealed.

Ann handed herself in in 2012 and is two years into a 12-year jail term.

Netty added: ‘I’m not mad at Ann any more. I was, but only because she hid something from me for so long. But I can appreciate what she did for me.’
