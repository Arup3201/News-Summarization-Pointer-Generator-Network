Extracts from Hope Solo's new book reveal the frustration she felt after the clique of older players within the U.S. women's soccer team suspended her for comments she made after being benched in favour of veteran goalkeeper Briana Scurry in 2007.

The outspoken two-time Olympic champion's autobiography, 'Solo: A Memoir of Hope', gives the 31-year-old's version of events after she described the decision to replace her for the United States' 4-0 defeat at the hands of Brazil 'the wrong decision'.

Detailing a dramatic and aggressive confrontation with the heroes of the 1999 World Cup winning U.S. team following her comments, Solo, who was 26-years-old at the time reveals she was made to publicly apologise twice before her teammates took the decision to kick her off the team during the tournament in China.

Hope Solo appeared on the 'Today' show to promote her new book 'Solo: A Memoir of Hope'.

Originally in the starting 11 for the 2007 World Cup, Solo was relegated to the bench after a series of poor performances during the United States' run to the semi-final match against the Brazilians.

Replaced by Briana Scurry, then 36-years-old, who had acted as Solo's mentor during her time in the soccer set-up, the flamboyant goalkeeper spoke to the media after the defeat to explain why coach Greg Ryan had made 'the wrong decision.'

'And I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that,' said Solo after the game.

'There's no doubt in my mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is, it's not 2004 anymore.'

The glamorous and outspoken U.S women's soccer player explained why she was kicked off the team in 2007 and how the team is now united

In the hours following her comments, Solo claims that she did not for-see any problems with what she had said.

However, upon arrival to their hotel in Shanghai, Solo was summoned to the hotel room of team captain Kristine Lilly, who was waiting for her with other so-called veterans of the 1999 World Cup victory.

'It was our team captain Kristine Lilly. She said the veterans wanted to talk to me and asked if I would come to their room,' explained Solo in her memoir.

'I walked down the hall. By now it was after midnight. I pushed open the door of Lil's room and saw the veterans grimly waiting for me. Kate Markgraf stood by the door. Lil, Shannon Boxx, Christie Pearce Rampone, Abby, and Bri sat on the beds.

'I walked across to the other side of the room and leaned against the wall.

'They had seen the interview. I was told that I had, in their opinion, basically committed treason.'

Describing the expletive filled lecture she received from the older players, Solo revealed that experienced defender Kate Markgraf walked out on the meeting saying 'I can't even f***ing look at you.'

Solo reveals in her book that she found this to be 'overly dramatic.'

'They told me that you don't throw a teammate under the bus, that I had broken the code, that I had betrayed the team,' said Solo.

'I was told that I had ruined everything this team was built on, and that I had torn down what Julie Foudy and Mia Hamm and Lil and all the players who paved the way for us had created.'

A poster-girl for the U.S. women's soccer team, Solo claims that she tried and failed to defend herself.

'I turned toward Bri. I wanted her to know that I wasn't trying to hurt her, not after everything she had done for me when my father died. I felt backed against the wall,' said Solo.

'Bri spoke first. She told me I had hurt her very much. She said she had tried to be there for me when my father died and was shocked that I would do this to her.

'I'm sorry Bri,' I said. 'I really am. I didn't mean to hurt you. My comments were directed at Greg, not at you.'

'I could tell how awkward I sounded. I wanted to have a private moment with Bri but I was in a room full of angry women who demanded that I perform a public act of contrition. Everything felt forced. Staged.'

Returning to her room after being told their would be a team meeting in the morning subsequent to the veterans meeting, Solo describes how she spent the night in tears.

In the morning, the controversial star was put in front of the squad to apologise and instead received a barrage of abuse.

'You don't sound sincere,' said one teammate.

'Do you even care what you've done?

'How can you turn your back on the team?

'Do you know how horrible you looked on television, pouting on the bench?

'You've been feeling sorry for yourself since Greg told you that you weren't starting. Some of us sit on the bench every game.'

Solo explains that she was sent away from the meeting while the rest of her teammates decided her fate.

'Eventually, I was informed that my teammates had deemed my apology insincere,' explained Solo.

'I needed to be punished. They would not allow me to play in the third-place game. I couldn't even go to the game. I couldn't eat meals with the team. I was suspended.'

Despite her punishment, Solo recovered the trust of her teammates and was the first-choice goalkeeper for the United States' victorious run to the 2008 Beijing Olympic gold.

The glamorous goalkeeper has since revealed she was still drunk when she appeared on the 'Today' show the morning after the victory.

There was heart-breaking defeat in penalties to Japan in 2011, but redemption this year at the London Olympics as Solo and her teammates exacted revenge on the Japanese in the final for the gold medal.

And it seems that Solo and the veteran's of 1999 still do not see eye-to-eye.

During the tournament, Solo attacked legendary player Brandi Chastain for her commentary criticism of current U.S. player Rachel Buehler.

After the game, Solo rattled off four tweets about Chastain. Among them: 'Its 2 bad we cant have commentators who better represents the team&knows more about the game.'

Solo also told Chastain to 'lay off commentating about defending' and goalkeeping 'until you get more educated' and 'the game has changed from a decade ago.'

Appearing on the 'Today' show this morning to promote her new book, Solo spoke of the natural 'competitor' in her.

'I put everything into this game and we have come a long way,' said the victorious goalkeeper.
