They say the apple never falls far from the tree - and the old adage certainly proved true for this lollipop man when he decided to track down his real father.

Not only did Darren Wardle, 47, who was adopted as a newborn, discover his biological father was also a lollipop man, he was stunned to find the two men had even applied for the same job.

Mr Wardle, from Cannock in Staffordshire, was given up for adoption by his parents - who were both just 15-years-old when they had him - a few days after he was born.

What are the chances? Darren Wardle, right, tracked down his biological father Paul Ferris, left, only to find they were both lollipop men - and had both applied for exactly the same job

Incredibly, Mr Wardle's adoptive mother, his wife, and his mother-in-law have all also worked as school crossing attendants. Mr Wardle has now been reunited with his biological father Paul Ferris, 62, after he decided to search for him following the death of his adoptive father.

After contacting Mr Ferris' daughters - Mr Wardle's half-sisters - through Facebook, he learned his biological dad was living in nearby Tamworth. Mr Wardle wrote to him and father and son were reunited for the first time since Mr Wardle was given up for adoption.

'It was an emotional thing, but I was just so surprised when he told me he was applying to be a lollipop man at the same council as me,' Mr Wardle said of the reunion.

'Due to the fact I am a mobile lollipop man, I don’t have a fixed station so it would be very rare for our paths to ever cross.'

Like father like son: Darren Wardle, seen in 1968 as a two-year-old, was adopted at just a few days old

Coincidences: Darren, seen left with his adopted sister Trina in Torquay in 1976, and right as an 16-year-old in 1982, said his adoptive mother, his wife and his mother-in-law have all worked as school crossing guards

Now both father and son work for Staffordshire County Council helping to guide schoolchildren safely across roads.

Father-of-five Mr Wardle, who has two grandchildren, said: 'Both my parents had me at just 15 years old, they were children themselves so I was put up for adoption from birth

Growing up: Darren, seen as an 18-year-old in 1984, was reunited with his biological father in 2010

'Around
25 years ago I decided to trace my mum, I went to our old house and 
asked a neighbour who had lived in the street since the houses were 
built if she knew where my mum may have moved to.

'She
told me the area of Tamworth, I immediately looked in the phone book 
and found an Uncle, he then put me in touch with my mum and the rest is 
history, it literally took around three hours,' Mr Wardle explained.

'After
speaking to my mum, she gave me some information about my dad but I 
didn’t search for him until four years after my adopted father 
died of cancer.

'I 
hadn’t seen my dad for 44 years and I managed to get in touch with his 
daughters, my half-sisters via Facebook, they told me to write to him, 
so I did.

'Just a few 
days later, he got back to me, he phoned me and we decided to meet at 
his house in Tamworth in May 2010,' Mr Wardle said.

Mr Ferris said: 'I was obviously delighted to meet up with Darren, and we found it particularly amusing that after all that time we were both going to be lollipop men. Like father, like son I guess.

'I was an engineer by trade and when I retired I decided to have a go at being a lollipop man to keep myself busy.

'I love the work. It’s the kind of job where you know you are doing something good and making a real difference.'

County councillor Simon Tagg, who oversees road safety in Staffordshire said: 'It makes you wonder whether being a lollipop man might be in the blood.

'In the blood': Both father and son now work as crossing attendants for Staffordshire County Council

'Paul and Darren are the guardians of our roads and like our other 321 patrol officers do a fantastic job in keeping our school children and parents safe.

'We have some of the safest roads in the county here in Staffordshire which is something we are proud of and have worked very hard to achieve.'
