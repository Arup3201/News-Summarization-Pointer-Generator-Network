Teacher Ellen Ruffle went missing 43 years ago, when she was 34 years old

Police in Scotland are searching the 
home of a primary school teacher who went missing more than 40 years ago
- fearing her body may be buried in the garden.

Ellen Elizabeth Ruffle was last seen in 1969 at her home in Annan Glade, Motherwell.

The 34-year-old primary school teacher, known to friends as Evelyn, was married with two children, then aged 4 and 18 months.

Mrs Ruffle was working at Cathedral Primary School, Motherwell when she went missing.

Strathclyde Police said it was
out of character for her to leave her family, but in more than four 
decades they have come no closer to solving the mystery of her 
disappearance.

Officers insist the search is standard procedure as part of a long term missing person inquiry.

But the use of ground penetrating radar indicates they fear Mrs Ruffle's body may be buried in the garden.

Police have brought in a ground penetrating radar to search for a grave in the garden of the Ruffle family home

Superintendent Andy McKay from 
Strathclyde Police said: 'It is now over 40 years since she went missing
and I urge anyone with information, no matter how small, to come 
forward and hopefully we can provide some resolution to her family.

'I have no doubt that someone has information which can help us to find out what happened to her.

'It
was completely out of character for her to leave her two small 
children. It may be four decades since she was last seen, however my 
officers are no less determined to find out what happened to her.'
