Tragedy: Casey Breese, 11, died in a freak accident while playing football

A schoolboy died when a rusty goalpost fell on top of him during a football game with his friends, an inquest heard today.

Casey Breese was goalkeeping when the studs of his football boot were caught in the net and in his attempts to free himself, the young boy brought the heavy metal construction over himself.

The 11-year-old Manchester United fan was playing with his friends in Caersws village, near Newtown in Powys when tragedy struck.

His friends witnessed how Casey came out from under the rusty bar and said he had trouble breathing.

Casey was airlifted to hospital but died of hepatic trauma as a result of a crush injury, the inquest in Welshpool, Mid-Wales was told.

George Clarke, 13, said ‘Casey was in goal when he went to make a save.

‘I saw Casey falling on his stomach with the bar landing on his back.’

George’s twin brother Edward said: ‘Casey jumped to save a shot but got his foot caught in the net.

‘The post fell over on him. Casey was on his stomach but he sat up and said he couldn’t breathe. His eyes were rolling.’

The metal posts were 20 years old, poorly maintained and had no restraining devices to prevent them from falling.

The inquest heard the net was not weighed down and was hanging close to the goal line where Casey was standing.

His friend Keiron Beaton, 15, said: ‘He tried to get his foot loose and pulled the goal down onto himself.’

All the boys gave written evidence 
after the coroner ruled it would be too traumatic for them to attend the
inquest into their friend’s death.

His heartbroken parents Shan and Nick had earlier paid tribute to their ‘full of fun’ son.

They said: ‘Casey was a lively, energetic lad, full of fun, and was loved by all in the community.

‘So many friends and members of the community remember Casey and he will be sadly missed by all.’

Pc Andrew Jones of Powys Police told 
the hearing there had been a previous incident when the goalpost fell 
down after a boy was swinging on the crossbar.

The officer confirmed to the hearing there were no restraining devices to stop the post from falling over.

The local welder who made the goal posts 20 years ago told the inquest the construction would be unstable unless pegged to the ground.

Ivor Lloyd, who also designed the goal himself, said: 'The posts had base plates which were secured to the ground using pegs.'

'I made them roughly twenty years ago but they are mine - you recognise your own work.'

The inquest heard there was no health and safety risk assessment carried out on the posts either by the Caersws recreation association or by the village football club.

The posts were paid for and commissioned by a local benefactor Gareth Williams who is known as 'Mr Football', were so heavy it took up to six men to carry them.

The
goalposts were taken away from the village recreation ground as part of
an investigation by police and the Health and Safety Executive.

The inquest continues.
