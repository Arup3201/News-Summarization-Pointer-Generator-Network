Apple and Samsung have spent years at loggerheads over various patent infringements, and despite calling a truce recently, the rivalry still runs deep it seems.

Reports claim that Apple was recently in talks with PayPal to be the ‘preferred payment process’ for its new Apple Pay service.

But, during talks, PayPal agreed to do a similar deal with Samsung, and this is said to have caused Apple to have called the whole thing off.

Sources close to Apple and PayPal revealed that Apple had hoped to add PayPal to Apple Pay, but during talks, PayPal signed a deal with Samsung. Apple was said to be ‘absolutely furious’ and snubbed the service completely. Neither firm has responded to MailOnline’s request for comment

The news of Apple's snub comes as PayPal and eBay separated this week, 12 years after the auction site bought the payment firm for $1.5 billion (£1 billion).

PayPal lets customers to pay online for goods and services while storing their card details on its own servers, rather than giving the details away to multiple websites.

It is in 203 countries and is expected to process a billion payments online this year. Revenues last year were £4.5billion and are growing at 19 per cent a year.

The move means PayPal can focus on growing its market share in an increasingly competitive environment. 

Sources close to both Apple and PayPal confirmed the reports to finance site Bank Innovation, which also reported on the talks last month.

The site claims that PayPal’s former president David Marcus was ‘categorically against the Samsung deal’, because he feared it would jeopardise the firm’s relationship with Apple.

But eBay’s chief executive John Donahoe is said to have pushed for the Samsung deal.

Bank Innovation continued that Apple was said to be ‘absolutely furious’, and snubbed the service completely.

Apple and PayPal have not responded to MailOnline’s request for comment.

The news comes as PayPal and eBay split this week, 12 years after the auction site bought the payment firm for $1.5 billion (£1 billion).

PayPal partnered with Samsung for the release of its Galaxy S5 in February (pictured). A finger scanner on the device authorises payments for goods, via PayPal, and acts as a password for accounts

Rob Skinner, Director of PR, PayPal UK, said at the time: 'Combining Samsung's fingerprint authentication with PayPal means users will no longer need to remember passwords or login details when they shop. 

'This new method strikes the perfect balance between convenience and security and we believe this will be the future for 2014 and beyond.’
