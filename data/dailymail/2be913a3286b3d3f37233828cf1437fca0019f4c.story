Dozens of homes are likely to have been destroyed and eight firefighters have been injured by a raging bushfire that continues to sweep through the northeastern Adelaide Hills as South Australia's worst bushfire since the 1983 Ash Wednesday blaze continues to threaten lives overnight.

There are several firefronts each one spanning kilometres in Adelaide Hills. At one stage on Saturday evening the smoke was so dense visibility was virtually nil. 

The out-of-control fire  is threatening the communities of Kersbrook, Gumeracha, Cudlee Creek, Inglewood, Houghton, Lobethal, Mount Torrens, Charleston, and Mt Pleasant after burning freely in all directions for most of Saturday.

In Victoria, storms brought a brief respite to firefighters battling blazes across the state, but not before a blaze at Moyston, in the state’s west, ­destroyed three homes, killed thousands of animals and burnt 4700ha of land.

An emergency warning had been put out for Hastings, Bittern and Crib Point on the Mornington Peninsula, but the CFA said these fires are now under control.  

Bittern evacuee Barbara Tipper said the roads were jammed as residents fled the fire.

‘It was getting pretty scary,’ she told ABC 24.

‘There's lots of smoke and we have no hope if a fire gets in here.’ 

About 40 dogs and cats have perished after a bushfire destroyed large parts of a boarding kennel and cattery in the Adelaide foothills.

Fire ripped through the Tea Tree Gully Boarding Kennels and Cattery on Saturday morning, burning down the cattery and a large section of the kennels.

All of the cats and about a third of the dogs at the kennels were killed.

Owner Paul Hicks says he and his wife were unable to take any of the animals with them when the fire forced them to evacuate.

The devastated couple's home was also destroyed in the blaze.

'It's really, really sad at the moment,' Mr Hicks told ABC radio.

"We're trying to come to terms with what's happened with us and think about what we do going forward.

It's my wife's passion. She loved the animals and she loved the customers.'

In Victoria, Moyston resident Cyd Kelly packed her loved ones - two dogs - into the car and got out of the Victorian town, as a large and uncontrolled bushfire approached.

"If the house goes, it's all just possessions," she said on Saturday while sitting outside the bushfire relief centre in Ararat.

The dogs - Frank and Ken - sat nearby, with a bucket of water, in Ararat's quiet main street.

About 20 people and their pets had arrived at the relief centre by Saturday afternoon.

Meanwhile South Australian premier Jay Weatherill has told residents in the Adelaide Hills to put their emergency evacuation plans in place and leave immediately. 

'Your lives are at risk and we are asking you to implement your bushfire survival plans,' Mr Weatherill said.

'If you decide to leave you should leave immediately.

'If you have decided to stay the fire could become incredibly scary and it could make you change your mind and leave.

'It could be a catastrophic decision to leave late.'

More than 10,000 hectares has been already been burnt and at least seven volunteer fire fighters have been treated for smoke inhalation. Around 500 firefighters supported by 100 appliances and 14 aircraft are currently battling the blaze, with more personnel and trucks to arrive from New South Wales.

At least five homes have been destroyed but CFS spokesman Rob Sandford says it is likely that dozens of homes have been annihilated in the Adelaide Hills region in northeast Adelaide. 

A band of lightning crossing Victoria on Saturday evening is also sparking more fires. Residents near Ararat in Victoria's west have been urged to leave their homes amid fears a wind change could send the fire towards them. 

An emergency warning also remains in place for Sampson Flat.

The fire is expected to burn well into next week. The major concern is to get the fire under control before the hot and windy conditions which are forecast for Wednesday. 

Lightning strikes are also causing further problems for fire fighters, starting several spot fires in the area. 

'There should be no sense of relief because of a temperature drop or spots of rain. Warnings must be heeded to,' said Premier Weatherill. 

Raging bushfires have also been burning in Victoria since Friday. By Saturday afternoon approximately 520 fires had been fought in Victoria in 30 hours. 

One home was lost in Moyston at the foothills of the Grampians in western Victoria after crews contained the bushfire and downgraded an emergency fire warning to a watch and act message.

The Country Fire Authority's aircrafts which have been helping to fight fires have been grounded in Hastings, Victoria due to wild winds.

The Adelaide Hills area is facing 'an incredibly dangerous fire', authorities warned.

'Your life is at risk and we are asking you to implement your bushfire survival plan,' a Country Fire Service spokesman said on Saturday.

The area 'is being confronted by a fire that hasn't been since 1983'.  

 Emergency services have accepted an offer of a specialist aircraft from NSW, along with other resources, and two air tankers from Victoria. 

Earlier on Saturday it was revaled that the CFS would have no chance of bringing the fire under control until conditions improved, CFS Chief Officer Greg Nettleton said.

'At this station, it's the elements that are in control,' he said.

'Our attempt to extinguish the fire will occur after the weather has abated.

'There's no way that we can stop this fire under the current weather conditions and with the current fuel situation.'

 Firefighters were also preparing for extreme conditions across Victoria, with one home already lost, as a grass fire threatened towns at the foothills of the Grampians.

Residents of a country Victorian town have been told to head to a nearby football ground as fire threatens their town.

In South Australia, on Saturday morning the out-of-control Sampson Flat fire burned an unknown number of homes overnight with firefighters expecting a strong wind to accelerate the fire.

'But it will be more than five' - the number of properties already reported lost on Friday, Brenton Eden of the Country Fire Service said.

Two of the lost homes belong to firefighters who have been battling the bushfire while another belongs to a police officer also helping in the emergency. 

Meanwhile, Mr Eden urged residents in a host of places to find safety now, ahead of an expected deterioration in conditions.

'Winds at the moment are quite benign, so now is the time when people should be packing up their valuables, taking care of their stock and getting out of there.
