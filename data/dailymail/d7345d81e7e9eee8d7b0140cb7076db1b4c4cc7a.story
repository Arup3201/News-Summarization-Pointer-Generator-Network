Forget give the dog a bone, this pampered pooch would likely dine on filet mignon and lobster given half the chance.

Bella Mia, a three-year-old full-breed Maltese from Great Neck, New York, is said to be one of the richest dogs in the world with a six-figure trust fund under her collar.

Last year, her owner Rose Ann Bolasny gave her a $100,000-a-year allowance to play with towards weekly paw-dicures, haircuts and designer shopping sprees. 

The 60-year-old accountant, who has two adult sons, says Bella Mia is the 'daughter she never had' and likes to refer to her as a child instead of an animal.

The canine boasts more than 1,000 outfits in her specially designed walk-in closets and jazzes up ensembles with diamond and pearl jewelry.

Touching on Bella Mia's penchant for fashion, Rose Ann said: 'Everyday [she] will go to the closet and we'll pick out what she will be wearing that day; it may be a pair of trousers or it may be a little jump suit.

'She has many ball gowns, coats, sweaters, pajamas, onesies, and she has skirts and she has dresses and she has jeans and blankets. 

'And hats and hats and more hats and shoes - she has a pair of Uggs.'

Bella Mia has her own bedroom complete with a double bed.

Rose Ann, who shares her home with retired husband Walter, 82, is also mother to sons Robert, 38 and Louis, 32.

The dog-lover said: 'When my son came home with Bella Mia I wasn't sure I wanted a dog. I was hoping to spend some time traveling with my husband after my sons left home.

'But when he walked through the door with her it was love at first sight. When I first saw her and they put me in her arms my heart just melted.'

And on her third birthday in April last year, the charming canine entered into the couple's trust fund after they changed their wills and now stands to inherit a newly purchased house in Florida. 

Rose Ann said: 'Prior to doing it I discussed having Bella Mia included in the trust fund with my sons and they totally understood.

'I explained to them that I know they love Bella Mia very much but I wanted to make sure that if anything happens to us she was taken care in the way that she's used to.

Wheely happy: Rose Ann says that some people might think she's overly extravagant with the money she lavishes on Bella Mia but they don't realize what joy the pet brings

'So afterwards I went to one of these doggy places and I bought about a half a dozen dresses and jewellery and bows and ribbons.

'They were having a contest that day and I entered Bella Mia into the contest and it was actually the first contest she had ever won. So we were hooked from there.'
