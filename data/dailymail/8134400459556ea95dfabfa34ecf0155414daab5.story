A Chinese mathematician claims to have come up with a new 'third way' to board a plane which could end the unseemly scrum of eager holidaymakers desperate to reach their destination.

Dr Tie-Qiao Tang of Beihang University in Beijing said while previous research had offered solutions to luggage congestion, routing and runway scheduling, his was the first to look at boarding.

He said that while the number of passengers travelling by air has leapt up, the increase in supply of airline transportation has not kept pace with demand.

'Thus, in practice, certain conflicts between supply and demand often occur, leading to airline congestions, passenger-luggage congestions and mixed traffic problems,' he said.

Dr Tang and team from Beihang University and Curtin University in Sydney created mathematical models to compare three styles of boarding strategy.

These included boarding completely at random, the current system of assigned seating, and a new way taking into account passengers' individual characteristics like maximum speed and luggage.

'Each passenger has their own individual properties,' Dr Tang told Science Network Western Australia.

'For example, each passenger’s luggage has a different attribution and thus has different influences on boarding behaviour; the time that the passenger’s ticket is checked at the gate is different; the time that the passenger deals with his or her carried luggage is different; seat conflicts have different effects on the passenger. Each passenger has a different optimal speed, maximum speed and safe distance.'

Fear of maths can activate regions of the brain linked with the experience of physical pain, a study has found.

The higher a person’s anxiety of a maths task, the more it increases activity in regions of their brain associated with visceral threat detection, and often the experience of pain itself, according to researchers Ian Lyons and Sian Beilock, from the University of Chicago, in the journal Plos One.

The authors say that previous research has shown that other forms of psychological stress, such as social rejection or a traumatic break-up, can also elicit feelings of physical pain.

Findings showed, unsurprisingly, that allowing passengers to board at random was the most inefficient method, leading to naughty travellers queue jumping, congestion in the aisles and jams before the gate and between the gate and the plane.

The currently used method - boarding by assigned seating - was better. However it was still inefficient since only passengers in the front of the queue could reach their seats at 'maximum speed' and seat conflicts occurred.

Dr Tang's new way was proved to be optimal. This included assigning seat numbers based on passengers' optimal speed, the properties of their hand luggage and tickets checked automatically with electronic equipment at the gate.

When passengers boarded the plane this way, according to the model, there was no congestion, jams, overtaking, queue jumping, seat conflict or wasted time.

However, questions remain as to how effective such a method would be in practice. Jamie Condliffe, a writer for Gizmodo, notes: 'Airlines could easily work out how carry-on luggage correlates with boarding speed and just add an extra weigh-in to factor how it affects seat allocation, for instance, while walking speed could be guesstimated as a function of age. How well that would work, though, is another question entirely.

'Add to the mix that it would mean that airlines would have to actively profile their customers—something many people wouldn’t be too happy with.'

Dr Tang is yet to find an airline to put the theory into practice but said he is open to collaborations to make his 'third way' a travel reality.

Findings were published in the journal Transport Research Part C.
