One is a white Jewish American woman aged 38. The other is a black Christian Jamaican man aged 23. They are married, but can't be together.

Jenny Messam, of Los Angeles, California, met Jason in July 2009 while on holiday in his native Jamaica and they married soon after in January 2010.

But U.S. Embassy officials in Jamaica believe their marriage was a fraud and denied Mr Messam a visa that would allow him to move to the U.S.

‘I get there are sham marriages,’ Mrs Messam told the Los Angeles Times. ‘But there also aren't. People do fall in love.’

Mrs Messam went to Jamaica on holiday in July 2009 and met her future husband when she was with her friend in a taxi and he got in as well.

He joined them at a club, they chatted all night and she soon phoned a childhood friend in a ‘smitten’ state, reported the Los Angeles Times.

She went back in October 2009, he proposed over the phone in November and they held the wedding while he had a pending visa application.

‘It's not like I was trying to marry an American,’ Mr Messam said. ‘It could be anybody else - as long as someone came around just like Jenny.’

Sadness: Jenny Messam's child Asher Ronen Messam is now aged six months and is yet to meet his father, who is still back in Jamaica

Her story has been compared to the 
1998 film How Stella Got Her Groove Back, starring Angela Bassett and 
Taye Diggs, that was first a book.

Jenny Messam

The story tells of a San 
Francisco stock broker called Stella Payne who goes on holiday to 
Jamaica and falls in love with a man there.

Mr Messam went to the immigration centre in Kingston almost a year after the wedding and was called back for an interview with his wife.

Two months later at that appointment she was five months pregnant and was asked a number of tricky questions, reported the Los Angeles Times.

She remembered an official asking her: ‘What could you possibly have in common with someone 15 years younger than you?’

The couple heard nothing for weeks 
despite Mrs Messam’s regular emails to the U.S. Embassy, which got back 
automatically-generated replies.

Jason Messam

Then her Beverly Hills congressman 
Henry Waxman found out from an immigration officer that officials believed ‘the 
claimed relationship is questionable’.

Back home she gave birth to Asher Ronen Messam, who is now aged six months and is yet to meet his father, reported the Los Angeles Times.

‘It's just hard not knowing him, not seeing him, not knowing how he does things,’ Jason Messam told the Los Angeles Times.

Now the case is with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for a further review that could take up to two years. That leaves the couple just waiting.
