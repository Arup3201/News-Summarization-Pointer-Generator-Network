Prince Harry today attempted to put the Las Vegas scandal behind him as he went on the charm offensive - joking with athletes and spectators during his first visit to the Paralympics since the Games started.

The young Royal's appearance comes hot on the heels of his first public outing in two weeks at the WellChild Awards in London after naked photos emerged from his holiday in 'Sin City'.

Sources said the prince was concerned 
about appearing in public after the media onslaught of the past few 
weeks but appeared back on top form
today as he laughed with athletes from Great Britain and around 
the world while watching Paralympic swimming.

Ellie Simmonds qualify for the women's S6 50m freestyle final.

The swimmer will be going for a hat-trick of London 2012 golds when she competes in the final later.

But it appeared that the athletes were more interested in posing for photos with the prince than watching what was going on in the pool.

Earlier in the day, the Prince cheered on the GB women's goalball team as they smashed their way to a 5-0 win against Denmark - securing themselves a place in the quarter-finals.

The game for visually impaired 
athletes is played in complete silence so the players can hear the 
tinkling of the bells inside the ball. 

Prince
Harry was obviously intrigued by the relatively new sport that was only
introduced to the Paralympic Games in Arnhem in 1980.

He spent some time ahead of the start of the match examining and listening to the ball the players use.

As
the game unfolded Harry, today dressed in a white, red and blue Great 
Britain tracksuit top with jeans, applauded and smiled as each of the 
goals was scored.

The rest of the crowd took every 
opportunity to cheer Paralympics GB on as loud as they could, with every
goal punctuated by huge cheers and rapturous applause.

The
team were helped to victory by Anna Sharkey's hat-trick of goals, with 
spectators chanting 'Sharkey, Sharkey' as she was substituted around a 
minute from the end.

When the match ended, Harry rose to give Britain's women a standing ovation.

The team will have to wait for the remaining matches in Group C and D today before finding out who they will face in tomorrow’s last eight matches.

While at the Aquatics Centre, the prince also met Paralympic athlete and British military hero Derek Derenalagi.

Derenalagi lost both legs and was pronounced dead after his vehicle hit an improvised device in Afghanistan in 2007.

But medics then found a pulse, and Derenalagi made a remarkable recovery. He competed in the discus event at London 2012, finishing 11th.

The pair laughed and joked as Harry praised his journey to the 2012 Paralympic Games.

Derenalagi said: 'He (Harry) asked me about my performance last Friday and I told him that I was very proud to have competed for ParalympicsGB but a little disappointed in my performance.

'He said that he thought it was a remarkable achievement to have gone from the frontline to representing GB again at the Games, and that I have a lot to offer ParalympicsGB.'

Prince Harry's Paralympic outing demonstrates the Royal is keen to put his holiday scandal behind him.

The Royal Family was left reeling 
last month after photographs of the prince frolicking with an unnamed 
blonde in his Las Vegas hotel during a sordid game of 'strip billiards' 
were published on the Internet and in one British newspaper.

One photograph shows Harry holding his
genitals as he cavorts with the girl while another shows the third in 
line to the throne's bare bottom.

Sharing a joke: Prince Harry at the Aquatic Centre with former soldier and Paralympic athlete Derek Derenalagi. Both Harry and Derek are wearing the Adidas Front Line to Start Line t-shirt, which are being sold to raise money to help injured servicemen and women such as Derek to get back into competitive sport

St James's Palace have appealed to British newspapers not to run the pictures, arguing that Harry has a reasonable expectation of privacy since he was on a private holiday.

Only The Sun chose to run them arguing that the photographs - which were taken by fellow revellers with the knowledge of his police protection officers and then sold to a US celebrity gossip website - were an issue of press freedom and in the public interest.

Their decision has prompted 3,600 complaints to the Press Complaints Commission but the palace has not made a decision over whether to take legal action yet.
