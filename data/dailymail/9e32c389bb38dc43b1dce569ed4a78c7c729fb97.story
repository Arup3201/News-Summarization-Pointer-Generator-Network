A man who received more than $1 million in compensation after he fractured his neck at a rugby league match has spent almost all of it within four months, a tribunal has heard.

Jason Cooper was at a Canberra Raiders game at Canberra Stadium when he broke his neck trying to catch a football at half-time as part of an audience competition on August 6 2006.

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal heard Cooper claimed a lump sum of $1,025,000 for personal injury last year, meaning he would no longer be eligible to receive Centrelink support until 2017.

Cooper said that he received a net amount of $516,236.65 from the settlement money after disbursements, consisting of $440,000 from the settlement itself and a Medicare refund.

When the Canberra resident received the settlement payment in February 2014, he decided to buy a three-bedroom home near Bateman's Bay, south coast of NSW so his two daughters and grandchildren have a place to stay when they come visit.

Cooper told the tribunal that his mother is currently living with him and during the time, he decided to buy new furniture and appliances because he did not want to use his mother's old items.

Other items that Cooper purchased included a ride-on mower, mobility scooter, fishing equipment, vacuum cleaner and steamer, sport memorabilia, model cars and solar power installations.

Cooper told the tribunal that he needed his stereo system and four television sets to help occupy his time

Along with his purchases, Cooper also bought a mobility scooter which set him back $5,500

The tribunal said his purchases were 'unwise, irresponsible and unnecessary' after he was 'aware of the necessity to use the settlement money in a sensible manner and to set aside sufficient funds to meet his living costs during the preclusion period'.

'The Tribunal concluded that the expenditure of the settlement money was not reasonable and his circumstances, including his financial situation, do not give rise to special circumstances.'

Cooper also repaid personal loans in full and gave his daughter $14,500 to help her boyfriend purchase a motor vehicle.

He said it was a gesture of his appreciation for his daughter’s efforts to helping the family financially after his accident when he could no longer work.

Cooper agreed that many items he purchased were not necessities but claimed that he was unable to check his spendings because he did not have access to internet banking.

The tribunal said he made 'unnecessary' purchases from his own choices including his fishing equipment

It's understood that that Cooper spent most of the settlement money within four months from February 2014

It's understood that that Cooper spent most of the settlement money within four months from February 2014 and his 'unnecessary' purchases were made from his own choices.

But Cooper told the tribunal that he could no longer work but needed a good quality stereo system and four of his television sets, a pool table and games machine to help occupy his time.

Following the accident, Cooper could no longer work as a full-time ceramic tiler and was placed on disability support pension in 2010.

His former partner was forced to take up a full-time job to support the family and make mortgage repayments because Cooper had no income.

The couple's daughters also took up part-time jobs after school to help but the family struggled with financial difficulties which caused Cooper's relationship to end with his partner 2008.

Cooper has refused to comment to Daily Mail Australia at the time of contact.
