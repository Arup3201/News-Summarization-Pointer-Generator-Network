Twelve years ago 24 photographers decided to carry out an ambitious project - to document a full New Year's Day every year for 24 years.

To begin with each was allocated one hour of the day to record what was going on around them.

But the project did not stop there. 

This was a project that was to last 24 years, with each photographer progressing one hour every year, so that at the end of 24 years, there will be 24 sets of images from New Year's Day - or 576 images. 

00.00 by Yvonne De Rosa – Untitled: 'I was in Reykjavik and I was with friends in the square close to the main church.' To contrast with the chaos she took this picture of a couple in 'a calm embrace and in their own magic space'

The original 24 photographers met while studying on a postgraduate photography course at Central St Martin's in London.  

Six prints from this year's project will be auctioned off in aid of Hope and Homes for Children, an international charity working to ensure that all children have the chance to grow up in the love of a family.

Curator Bridget Coaker said: 'When I first heard about 24photography I thought what a great idea, I do hope they manage to keep the momentum going. Now in its 12th year this group of dedicated photographers are still going out in all weathers and all hours to capture something that shows something of the first day of each New Year. Their commitment to the project is inspiring.'

Claire Spreadbury, founder of 24photography, said: 'The exhibition is going from strength to strength and now in our twelfth year we've really developed an identity and feel that we're an established part of London's art calendar. New Year's Day is an exciting time of the year, and we hope that 24 captures some of that excitement, but also gives a little glimpse into the rest of the day after the celebrations and parties.' 

01:00 by Algy Sharman – Superhero: 'This shot was taken in a cafe near a spooky industrial estate outside Stockholm.This guy and his buddy were out skateboarding. He was waiting for a kebab, so was I'

02:00 by Alex Christofides – Untitled: Alex is fascinated with the human condition, how we relate to one another and our environment. His documentary work explores social issues such as mental health awareness and social exclusion

03:00 by Christoph Grothgar – Off-centre… but this universe is for you: 'The photograph is of the last firework I had kept until my time slot had come. While taking the picture, I had think of someone who told me that I shouldn’t always have everything in the centre, so I took it off-centre'

04:00 by Virginia Standard-Sheader: 'My image was taken in Hanoi, Vietnam, in the old quarter. Showing a young man, sleeping on his bike oblivious to the chaos around him'

05:00 by JF VALLET - dancing with the death: 'My picture was taken in my flat in Paris, back from a new year's eve party. A little bit tired, i was wondering what i could shoot and discussing about that with my room-mate Laurent, we had the idea to play with the science skeleton belonging to my wife Marion. A lot of scenes were tried in an self-portrait mode and at a moment, i decided to dance with the skeleton. Getting older, 2015 is for me the step to the age of fourty. Dancing with the death is an ironic reference for me, as if i was daring the death'

06:00 by Ali Waggie – Celestial watcher guardian angel: 'Every night this constellation stands above us. He watches from on high, what has he seen, heard? Powerless to help as mankind destroys the earth below'

07:00 by Colin Blackstock - The restless cries: 'Hours earlier cheers and joyous voices welcomed a new year with Champagne toasts and fireworks, the remnants of which line the banks of the river. Billingsgate is silent now, but what crepuscular cries echo through the ages here'

08:00 by Rachel Sato Banks-Lust: 'My image was taken in Amsterdam, around the Red Light, near where I live. New Years is an experience, in this city, that is particularly colourful. There's also a dark and mysterious energy about Amsterdam: it bubbles at the surface of what you can see... beyond the tourists. It's fascinating. And part of why I love this city'

09:00 by Sarah Lucy Brown– Mono no aware: 'Due to an unseasonably warm start to the winter, this delicate cherry blossom tree had flowered already. It caught my eye and I felt that it symbolised a good start to the New Year'

10:00 by Nicky Willcock – The house where Matt lived

11:00 by Enrico Vietti – Asian Xmas: 'Christmas time in Asia is a good example of the (often tacky) mix between different cultures. Even in 20 degrees, you can see Santa Claus in the streets and Christmas trees are everywhere, although they tend to be integrated in some Asian context and elements. Picture has been taken in Hoi An, Vietnam, a city well known for its tailors and lanterns'

12:00 by David Mazza – Decade: 'Ten years ago we were married on our farm in Western Australia. New Year’s day 2015, became a beautiful summer evening and the kids wanted to go for a walk up to Wedding Hill'

13:00 by Pierre Mansiet– Modern day hero: 'The "Modern Day Hero" image was done during the new year's parade on Champs Elysées and the "star" of the parade was this Hero Go Pro camera attached to its telescopic cane/stick - a sort of prothesis extension on many arms / hands.They were all over and are developing quickly. I know the National Museum in Washington DC forbid them in the museum as they were so many of them and this started to cause problems'

14:00 by Guy Bell – I love you: 'New Year’s Day offers people the chance to consider changes as well as relax. I decided to go to Winter Wonderland, in Hyde Park, to gauge the mood. I expecteda sea of miserable people trudging around and being ripped off but, instead, saw a more cheery view of life – how simple and sometimes corny things (fairground rides, soft toys, balloons and hotdogs) can entertain and genuinely lift the mood'

15:00 by Lola Nichols – On the edge

16:00 by Charlotte Duval – Untitled: 'Connected. Everywhere. All the time. Every day'

17:00 by Anthony Curran – Alone: 'New Year's Day is a busy time, the sales are on in Oxford Street and the area is packed with people. Despite this there is still plenty of opportunity for people to be isolated. New technology can make thismore bearable, whilst at the same time making it more likely'

18:00 by Candida Jones- Hangover: My image: 'Hangover, was taken in Tooting (Wandsworth). For me it sums up how many of us feel on New Year's Day; tired, aching, and more than a little green around the gills'

19:00 by Raphael Schutzer-Weissmann - Intolerance: 'I took this photo in response to the anti-immigrant rhetoric increasinglynoticeable in the UK and Europe recently. At first it seemed Romanians were the target; but the Charlie Hebdo atrocity took things to a new level; it became a blame game; blame the immigrants, blame theMuslims, blame the Jews, blame somebody, for something. To my mind inclusiveness and diversity are things to be celebrated, not demonised'

20:00 by Helen Chambers – Quietways and Superhighways: 'This picture was taken crossing London Fields on the way back from seeing friends … the day after the night before. The park felt quiet compared to usual, but it struck me that there is always a hum in London and the constant signs of people interacting, no matter what day of the year'

21:00 by Claire Spreadbury - Untitled: 'My image is intended to portray the innocence of childhood as well as capturing the fashion of the time - the Onesie'

22:00 by Gavin Morris - Bag of Bands: Gavin Morris is an artist teacher living and working in South Devon. His photograph was taken at 22:00 in south London whilst visiting friends. The image shows the inside of a bag of his daughter's loom bands, their bright colours and huge numbers have been a major feature both at home and away and will continue to be into 2015

23:00 by Gas Esilarante – All was homely in Iceland: 'Here's what we're used to breathing. Little by little we learn not to see and not to think.Gas esilarante means laughing gas: it causes euphoria or confusion. The anesthetic effect of nitrous oxide is not well-documented in detail, but it is thought that it interacts with the brain by altering intercellular communication at synapses. It is classified as a soft drug. Odourless'
