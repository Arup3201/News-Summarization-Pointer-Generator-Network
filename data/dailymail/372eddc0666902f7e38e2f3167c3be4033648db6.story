For almost 50 years, he has been the very soul of secrecy and reticence, refusing even to admit he was ever a member of the IRA. 

But in the two weeks since Gerry Adams joined Twitter, the Sinn Féin TD and former MP and MLA has developed an extreme case of TMI – too much information. 

His 75 tweets – an average of more than five a day – have a collective embarrassment factor that makes MI6’s dossier redundant.

So far his posts have revealed him to be an absent-minded ­64-year-old who owns several teddy bears and takes his toothbrush into the Dáil chamber instead of his pen. 

And he is in danger of being dubbed ‘Ducky ár lá’ after letting slip that he takes his yellow rubber duck in to the bath with him.

He has revealed musical tastes that extend from Joni Mitchell to Leonard Cohen to Luke Kelly and has admitted to being a ­tree­­-hugger.

His dramatis personae includes his favourite teddy bear, Ted; a Shinner called Lightbulb who is a terrible driver; and a trusted aide called RG.

But Grizzly’s most embarrassing foray into the Twittersphere so far came last week when he admitted breaking into his own house.

First the Twitter ingenu told his followers at 4pm: ‘RG took the car. Took my house keys also. I feel an adventure coming on.’

By 5.35, Gerry was still locked out. He was prepared to shin up the drainpipe but was frustrated by a broken pipe – a shinner clearly unwilling to jump without cast-iron guarantees.

‘RGs phone constantly engaged. Its getting dark. Wud climb in back window but downpipe broken,’ he tweeted forlornly. A little later, Gerry took matters into his own hands. He tweeted: ‘RG traced. Where are u now when we need u? 70 miles away. Im in now. Starving. Need a glazier. Slan.’

Embarrassment factor: In his tweets, Mr Adams mentions frequently his favourite teddy bear Ted (right) and his dog Snowie (left)

Since then, it’s all been down hill. 
Under the name @GerryAdamsSF he revealed: ‘Friday! Yahoo! Getting home 2
c the small people in my life. Cant wait. Ted will b sasta.’

Included in the tweet was a link to a picture he had taken of four teddy bears of varying sizes, including a yellow one with an Antrim GAA badge on his chest. 

‘Sasta’, properly ‘sásta’ is one of the stock national-school Irish phrases that pepper Mr Adams’s tweets. Embarrassingly, he had to be taught how to make a fada on Twitter – and his first effort instead produced a French grave accent.

‘This twitting cud b addictive. And shud not b done under the influence. So sin è. Ah my first tweeted fada. At last. Oiche mhaith. Xo,’ he crowed.

Ted is frequently mentioned. On St Valentine’s Night, Mr Adams wrote; ‘Cooking. Oysters romantiq Cog au vin. Jelly & custard Champagne & strawberries. Pity I’m on my ownieoh. Ted is out.’

Proving popular: At the latest count, Mr Adams had amassed more than 10,000 followers

Last week he wrote that he had accidentally brought his toothbrush into Leinster House.

‘In Dáil chamber. Thought I had a pen in my pocket. Discovered it is a tooth brush! Silly me!!!!’

On February 9, he wrote that he had seen some unusual natural behaviour while on an early morning bike ride.

‘Saw the dawn breaking. Grey light. Out on bike. Saw a squirrel chasing a cat. A grey one. The squirrel that is. Glad 2 b alive. So is cat,’ he observed.

Party officials confirmed the account is his, and say the tweets show a side of Adams they often see in their dealings with him. 

‘He is far more relaxed in private,’ said a Sinn Féin TD.

‘During the years of the peace process, it was a sensitive process and as the leader of Sinn Féin he had to be conscious of people’s feelings. It was a serious business and it didn’t look good to be laughing and joking all the time.’

At the latest count, Mr Adams had amassed more than 10,000 followers.

As for the 30 Tweets being followed by Mr Adams, let’s hope they are not of a nervous disposition.
