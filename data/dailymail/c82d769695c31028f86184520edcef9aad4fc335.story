Manchester United are waiting eagerly on the results of Wayne Rooney's groin scan after the striker was spotted leaving a hospital in Manchester on Friday.

Rooney is almost certain to miss the FA Cup clash with Swansea after playing through the pain barrier in the 2-1 defeat by Tottenham at Old Trafford.

He has been one of the few positives so far this season for boss Moyes, who looks destined to fail in his bid to retain the title in his first season in charge of the Barclays Premier League champions.

The striker has played 24 matches for Manchester United, scoring 11 goals. United have won 15 of those games. And with Robin van Persie also out, Rooney's injury could not have come at a worse time for Moyes.

Moyes revealed this week that Rooney had a groin injury but admitted that he simply can't afford to play without the talismanic forward as his side continue to toil.

After missing the 1-0 victory at Norwich on Saturday, Rooney did not train in the build-up to the New Years Day defeat Spurs, but the United boss restored the striker to the starting line-up on Wednesday evening and he played the full ninety minutes as United fell to a sixth Premier League loss of the season. 

'He has got a bit of a groin injury but the longer it went on, we had to try and get more attacking players on the pitch to try and find more ways score,' Moyes revealed.

When asked if the England man would benefit from a more expended period to recover, Moyes admitted he is reluctant to do without United's most influential forward: 'If I could, I would. The games are coming thick and fast. He has missed a couple of games with his groin and may well miss some more in the games coming up.' 

Robin van Persie is inching closer to a return to full fitness but Sunday's FA Cup tie at home to Swansea may come too soon for the Dutchman. 

'I am not sure yet,' Moyes said.
