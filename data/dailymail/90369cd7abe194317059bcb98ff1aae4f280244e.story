Huddersfield Town centre back Anthony Gerrard has joined League One Oldham Athletic on loan.

The out-of-favour 29-year-old is set to feature in Saturday’s game at Crewe Alexandra.

Gerrard, who was injured during pre-season, has made only one start and three appearances from the bench this season.

He is out of contract at the end of this season and is considering a move to the MLS to follow his cousin Steven Gerrard.

Oldham manager Dean Holden told the club's official website: 'Gerrard is a player we have tracked for a couple of weeks now. He is a natural leader with a good pedigree and most importantly he is a winner.

'He will be a very good addition to our squad.'

Gerrard could join his brother Steven by moving from England to play for a team in MLS next season
