Disgraced: Florida osteopath Dr Daniel McBath has died of a heart attack two months after he was banned from treating female patients in light of allegations of sexual abuse and professional misconduct

A Florida doctor accused of repeatedly drugging at least three female patients with cocaine and sedatives and sexually assaulting them, has died while vacationing in Tennessee, his family said.

Dr Daniel McBath, an osteopath from Dade City had his license restricted by the state in December for 'egregious and predatory' behavior involving three women.

McBath, 53, who was forced to close his practice following the allegations, died from a heart attack in the early hours of Monday morning.

Don McBath said his brother had been determined to fight 'clear his name' but said that the allegations 'were too much.'

'There's not a person on this earth who could handle the pressure he was faced with. He was never arrested, never any hearings. It was nothing but allegations, and it weighed on him. he told the Pasco Tribune.

Don McBath said that several of his brother's former friends 'ostracized' him after news broke about the allegations, which were investigated by the Dade City Police Department and Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

'These allegations have existed, some of them for a long time, and no arrests were ever made,' Don McBath said. 

'I wonder why? Probably because there's no evidence. It was sad to see people he thought were his friends turn their back on him.

'He was totally distraught over this stuff. And it all boiled down to money — people wanting settlements and stuff like that.'

McBath is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son.

The physician allegedly assaulted some of the victims at his McBath Medical Center at 23933 17th Street in Dade City

Under an emergency order issued by the Department of Health, McBath was prevented from treating female patients at his McBath Medical Center at 23933 17th Street in Dade City in December.

According to the 34-page order signed by State Surgeon General John Armstrong and cited by WPTV, McBath repeatedly drugged and sexually assaulted a patient with a history of abuse between June 2009 and January 2014.

The doctor diagnosed the victim with obesity, even though at the time the 5-foot-7 woman a weighed only 135lbs.

He later diagnosed the woman with hormonal imbalance, chronic pain, anxiety and fatigue 'without any supporting medical justification,' the order states, and prescribed her a cocktail of Adderall, Xanax, hydrocodone and B-12 shots.

On at least one occasion, McBath allegedly injected a white liquid into the patient's vagina, telling her it would give her a stronger sex drive.

In the course of her treatment, the 35-year-old woman came to McBath's house and he instructed her to put on his wife's clothes, which she refused to do.

The doctor and patient drank alcohol and used cocaine. The order states the woman then passed out and later woke up in McBath's bed.

With the woman slipping in and out of consciousness, McBath injected her with an unknown substance in her vagina and then proceeded to have sex with her, along with another man who was at the house, the document claims.

Identified only as Mr DH' in the order, the man allegedly had vaginal, oral and anal sex with the woman. McBath later also penetrated her with his hand, causing her to bleed profusely.

On another occasion, McBath allegedly asked the patient to rub her privates with a cigar. Months later, the doctor took a photo of the woman's vagina without her consent, the order states.

In July 2004, McBath's then-26-year-old intern reported an incident during which the married doctor came over to her house to teach her how to perform a varicose vain removal procedure.

Both of them drank beer and McBath gave the intern two blue pills telling her it was an antibiotic.

The medicine made the woman feel woozy, which McBath claimed was a reaction to the antibiotic.

While McBath was performing a 'chiropractic manipulation' on his employee, the order states he rolled her on her back, took her face in his hands and told her he had 'wanted to do this since the second day of work.'

The well-respected doctor then started kissing her on her mouth and breasts despite her protestations, according to the order, before exposing his erect penis and asking her if she 'wanted some of this.' The intern then lost consciousness.

She came to on McBath's couch sometime later and was told by the doctor that they had 'made love,' the order states.

The 26-year-old found her neck to be covered in 'love bites' and later tested positive for a sedative.

'Egregious': The doctor allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted a 35-year-old woman with a history of abuse between June 2009 and January 2014 after misdiagnosing her with obesity 

The most recent incident involving Dr McBath dates to April of last year when he allegedly gave his long-time patient a shot for a suspected urinary tract infection, which caused her to pass out.

The 32-year-old woman, who has been McBath's patient since age 14, woke up on his couch four hours later. She too tested positive for the same sedative as the intern.

When the patient reported the incident to police, detectives had her call McBath to talk to him about what happened between them, with officers listening in on their conversation.

McBath allegedly told the woman that they did not have sex and instructed her not to talk about this to anyone.

McBath, who has a wife and two grown children, has not been charged with any crime pending an investigation by the local sheriff's department.

When contacted by Tampa Bay Times for a comment on the allegations, the doctor has denied the patients' claims, calling them 'pathetic' and saying they were the result of retaliation, but he would not say for what.

'Dr. McBath demonstrated predatory behavior,' the emergency order in the case concludes. 'The number of patients that have reported the sexual misconduct and administration of substances without consent indicates that Dr. McBath's conduct will continue.'
