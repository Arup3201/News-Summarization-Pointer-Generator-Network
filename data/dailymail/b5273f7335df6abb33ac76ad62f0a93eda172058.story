As a textbook example of how not to handle a scandal, it would be hard to beat the Dustin Johnson affair. No-one has emerged from it with any credit, with the result Johnson’s request for privacy and obvious need for it as he deals with his ‘personal challenges’ has been rudely violated.

Just imagine if last Thursday, Johnson’s statement explaining he was taking an indefinite leave from the game gave a proper insight into his problems. Nothing salacious, just the barest facts. Is there one among us who would have felt the need to cast the first stone?

Instead, there was a rush to fill the vacuum, with Golf.com publishing a story online that was positively cruel in its lurid allegations of Johnson’s party lifestyle. Talk about kicking a man when he’s down. The central claim made, though, was a serious one: Johnson had been given a six-month suspension for violating the tour’s anti-doping policy concerning recreational drugs.

Now say this is true, despite the PGA’s insistence that he is not banned but on voluntary leave, would it have been the end of the world to own up to it? It wouldn’t be like he would have taken steroids, would it? There’s clearly a path to redemption. And wouldn’t he have been left in peace to deal with his demons? He could have come back when he was ready a new man.

Instead we’ve had a lamentable apparent lack of transparency from the tour and Johnson’s hapless management company that has just allowed the sorry mess to rumble on and on. If the Golf.com story is wrong, why isn’t his agent expressing his fury and taking legal action? Perhaps this is yet to happen. If not imagine what it will be like when Johnson does come back. You can picture the first question right now. ‘Did you test positive for drugs?’ And so on. All they have done is suspend the questions for another day.

Late on Friday night the tour issued a statement in the wake of the Golf.com story. It read: ‘This is to clarify that Mr Johnson has taken a voluntary leave of absence and is not under suspension from the PGA Tour.’

In fact, it clarified nothing and smacked of more opacity. Many within the game believe it nothing more than an exercise in lawyerly semantics, akin to the man resigning before he is sacked.

Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley summed it up perfectly on Sky. ‘The PGA Tour policy is a very risky one because now they are reacting to events as they happen, which is not where you want to be,’ he said.

Let’s hope lessons are learned.
