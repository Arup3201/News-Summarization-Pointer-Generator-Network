A man was rescued last night after he was adrift for six hours on a paddle board off the coast of Cornwall.

His family became concerned when he failed to return and rescuers were scrambled at 8pm.

The RNLI and coastguard teams from Penzance, St Ives, Penlee and Porthleven raced to the scene along with a helicopter and searched for several hours.

Three hours later, a lifeboat found Mr Holtaway floating behind St Michael's Mount, approximately one mile off shore. 

He was taken to hospital in Treliske for a check up where he was treated for suspected hypothermia.

Speaking after his ordeal, Mr Holtaway said: 'It was a beautiful evening in Marazion, I paddled out on my board in the sunset and drifted further/got colder than I could get myself back to shore from.

'Six hours later the lifeboat took me onboard, and brought me in.

'Much love, respect and appreciation for everyone who was on the beach, the emergency services, my friends and family (all are family.x)'

Martin Leslie, the coastguard's area commander, said: 'The guy has been recovered.

'He was found by the lifeboat at the back of St Michael's Mount.

'He's being transported to Treliske hospital by land ambulance.

'He was wearing a wetsuit and had a paddleboard or something similar.

'If you're going to go out you must let people know where you're going to go, what time you're going to be back.

'Stay within your limitations.

'Today it's calm, it's flat, it's good conditions - but it is very cold, even standing here on the shore side.'

An eyewitness who saw the rescue said: 'The helicopter has been scanning up and down the shore.

'There's been the coastguard and a rib flying around with lots of people on the beach with torches and also off St Michael's Mount with high power torches.

'It's been quite a large scale search we've seen tonight.

'We're standing here nicely wrapped up - but to be out on the water on a night like this is going to be pretty challenging.

'The level at which the helicopter has been flying across Mount's Bay has been incredible - probably no more than 20 feet above the water in pitch black conditions.

'These people are taking a lot of risks to try to find whoever has gone missing.'

Mr Holtaway's brother Ben has thanked the lifeboat crew for plucking him to safety, describing them as 'superstars.'

He wrote: 'Fantastic Penlee, can't say thank you enough, I have one lucky brother.'

A spokesman for Penlee lifeboat added: 'After nearly three hours of searching for a missing person Penlee Lifeboat found the young man a mile south of Marazion Beach around 11pm.

'The person, who had been in the sea for five hours was taken to Newlyn harbour by the Lifeboat then conveyed to hospital by ambulance.

'The young man is suffering from hypothermia but should be ok, a great result this evening, it really was a fantastic effort by everyone involved.'

Mr Holtaway left his clothes and bicycle on the beach at Marazion around 5pm when he entered teh worker.   

Patch Harvey, coxswain at Penlee RNLI, described how crews spent three hours searching for Mr Holtaway in darkness.

He said: 'Thankfully this story has a happy ending but it could have been very different.

'Joe paddled out on his paddleboard at about 5pm, just before darkness fell, but quickly became very cold, disorientated and confused.

'Despite the calm conditions, it is not advisable to enter the sea at this time of year, at such a late hour, without any means of communication with the shore.

'It is very easy to lose your bearings when darkness falls and you are freezing cold.

'On this occasion there was a happy ending but Joe was very lucky that the crew found him safe

A spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said coastguards received a call reporting Mr Holtaway's disappearance at 8pm.

'The Penlee all-weather and inshore lifeboats, the Penzance, Porthleven and St Ives Coastguard Rescue Teams and the Culdrose Royal Navy Search and Rescue Helicopter all assisted in the search,' the spokesman said.

'A lifeboat later found the person approximately one mile offshore.'

Mr Holtaway and his family later visited Penlee Lifeboat Station to thank Mr Harvey and the volunteer crew of the Ivan Ellen and Paul Alexander lifeboats.
