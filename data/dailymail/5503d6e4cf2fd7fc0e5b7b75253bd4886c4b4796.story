It was the pit bull versus the pineapple but it appears the  tropical fruit is too much of a prickly customer for this pooch.

Quite what petrified Stella the dog is unknown, but owner Jolene Creighton who posted the footage on YouTube said her pet, which is a cross breed mix, gets 'spooked by strange things.'

'I think she's just a bit skittish,' said Creighton, from Hattiesburgh, Mississippi, adding her dog is 'timid around random objects, like balloons.'

Peeved pit bull Stella eyes her enemy as the spiky tropical fruit sits on the counter. Her owner Jolene Creighton said she found the dog wandering the streets near her home in Hattiesburgh, Mississippi and that she isn't familiar with day to day stuff    

In the hope of showing the cowardly canine that the fruit was harmless Creighton placed the pineapple on the floor, but Stella continued to bark at it. Her other dog eventually showed Stella that the fruit was harmless

The 62 second clip shows Stella barking at the fruit which is placed on the sideboard above her. As Creighton tries to show her that it is nothing to be scared of by placing it on the floor, the petrified pit bull backs off. 

'Stella trusts me and I trust her,' wrote Creighton. 'I turned the camera off when it was clear that she was not going to approach the pineapple on her own. 

'Then I called my other dog over and showed her that it was okay,' she added. 'I wasn't thrusting the pineapple at her or chasing after her with it. I am not that horrible or awful.

'I really don't want to train my dog to attack everything that she is scared of. I mean, if she viciously mauled the pineapple, then I wouldn't get a tasty fruit snack. And that would be sad.' 

After Stella became a YouTube hit, Creighton showed the footage to her bemused dog, who appeared less than impressed with the outcome

She added that Stella and the fruit had 'made friends.'  

After the video went viral on the internet, Creighton showed it to Stella and tweeted a picture of the result. Needless to say, her pooch was less than impressed.

'There will be murderings,' Creighton joked about her bemused pooch.
