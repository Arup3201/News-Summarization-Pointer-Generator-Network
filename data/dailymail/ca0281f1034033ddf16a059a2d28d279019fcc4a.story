Liverpool players past and present painted the town red on Sunday night following the All-Stars charity match at Anfield.

Among the stars to revel in the moment at the Hilton Hotel in Liverpool was Steven Gerrard, who had earlier captained one of the teams in a 2-2 draw in front of a sell-out crowd in the game organised by the Liverpool FC Foundation.

Joined by a host of Liverpool legends, the Anfield faithful were once again graced with the presence of the likes of Xabi Alonso, Alvaro Arbeloa, Dirk Kuyt and Pepe Reina, and gave a particularly warm welcome to familiar faces Luis Suarez and Fernando Torres.

Also joining in with the celebrations was Liverpool left-back Jose Enrique, who said it was a 'great party after the game.' 

Posing for photographs for his Instagram account, Reds captain Gerrard celebrated a successful afternoon that saw him net twice from the penalty spot to cancel out Mario Balotelli and Didier Drogba's goals for the equally star-studded XI skippered by former team-mate Jamie Carragher.

Reflecting on a day which will see all proceeds given to various local charities - including not only Liverpool's official charity but also Alder Hey Children's Hospital - the former England captain expressed his pride following the afternoon's events.

'I enjoyed the day. It was brilliant being a part of it,' Gerrard said. 

'The main reason we were here today was for the charities, to help give something back to the city. Me and Jamie [Carragher] were keen to do another event and with a big help from the club we've made it happen. We've done it in an enjoyable way.'

Back in familiar surroundings was former striker Torres, who scored 65 goals in 102 appearances for the Merseyside club.

'Amazing [to be back]. So emotional after many years to come back here,' Torres said. 

'The love of the people is amazing. Everybody knows Liverpoool supporters are different class. For me today is an unforgettable day.

'Amazing [reaction from the Kop]. My best memories in football are playing here at Anfield.'
