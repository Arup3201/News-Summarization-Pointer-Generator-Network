Juventus ensured their treble dreams remained alive as they overcame a first-leg defeat thanks to goals by Alessandro Matri, Roberto Pereyra and Leonardo Bonucci.

The feat was made even more impressive as the Old Lady were without key trio Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba and Andrea Pirlo. 

Juventus were hit with the news that former Premier League striker Tevez was to miss the match due to a thigh injury just hours before kick-off, however his absence did not prove to be costly.

Massimiliano Allegri's side came into the game knowing they had to go on the attack if they were to progress to the Coppa Italia final  after falling to a shock 2-1 defeat at the Juventus Stadium.

And the visitors did just that as Matri opened the scoring in the 21st minute by poking home from close range after he benefitted from a ricochet. 

Juventus doubled the scoring shortly before the interval when Pereyra placed the ball into an empty net after Fiorentina goalkeeper Neto parried into his path following a thunderous shot by Alvaro Morata.

The Italian league leaders did not hold back during the second half and managed to kill the encounter shortly before the hour mark when unlikely goalscorer Bonucci latched onto a Claudio Marchisio corner before striking a beautifully-timed volley into the net.

Marchisio's booking and Morata's bizarre red card were the only negatives of the night. 

Inexperienced referee Davide Massa brandished a red card in the direction of Morata after a clumsy challenge, which warranted nothing more than a yellow, on Alessandro Diamanti with just two minutes left to play.

Marchisio will definitely miss the final against either Napoli and Lazio due to an accumulation of bookings, while Morata should be confident of winning an appeal.

Juventus, who currently lie 14 points clear at the top of the Serie A table,  can now focus on their upcoming Champions League quarter-final clash against Monaco.
