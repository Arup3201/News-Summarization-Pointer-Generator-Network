Dozens of parents and schoolchildren were involved in a mass brawl after a father confronted a mother about his son being bullied.

The fight, which was captured on a security camera outside a fire station in Alexander, Arkansas, took place on February 19.

The father, who claims his son was the victim of repeated bullying at Bryant High School, said he had arranged to meet with the accused bully's mother to discuss the matter.

Pandemonium: Dozens of parents and schoolchildren brawl in Arkansas after a father confronted a mother about his son being bullied

But according to a court affadavit, the woman arrived with a group with family and friends.

The situation quickly descended into chaos as rival parents and children exchanged punches and threw weapons at one another, it is claimed.

The astonishing footage begins with a large group of people milling around the fire station courtyard.

As a fight breaks out between two individuals others rush over to join in, and within a matter of seconds around 25 people are fighting furiously.

At one point a man arrives in a sports car and is seen rushing out of his vehicle and steaming in to join the fray.

Children are seen looking on in astonishment as the parents battle one another. According to one witness the fight only ended after someone fired shots.

When local law enforcement arrived on the scene they were met with a wall of silence and no arrests were made.

But the prosecutors office later obtained a two party warrant on the case, which means the parents involved must appear in court.

Saline County Sheriff's Lt. Scott Courtney told arkansasmatters.com: 'We attempted to speak with a couple of people and no one wanted to talk to us about the incident.

'Our involvement in this is pretty much wrapped up since the two parties involved in this are going to court and this is in the judicial system'.

A spokesman for Bryant school said the bullying allegations were thoroughly investigated by an assistant principal in line with and district procedure.
