The St Leger, racing’s oldest Classic, and host track Doncaster have received a major boost with news that sponsors Ladbrokes have extended their deal until 2016.

It had been feared that the bookmaker would pull out of backing the race it had supported for 10 years because of the fresh clash with the new Irish Champions weekend.

Ladbrokes and Doncaster were both left deeply frustrated that the rival fixture was nodded through with BHA support without any consultation with them.

That frustration still festers but fears that the inaugural Irish meeting would detract from the Leger proved unfounded.

Over 60,000 attended the four-day meeting, half of them on St Leger day and viewing figures in Channel 4 were up.

However, Ladbrokes have warned any hope of the deal being extended further heavily depends on the wider commercial deals in the sport involving Levy plus Data and Media rights.

Nick Rust, Managing Director of Ladbrokes Retail, said: ‘It is well known within the industry that we were disappointed by the BHA's approach to supporting the decision of Irish Champions weekend to clash with Ladbrokes St Leger weekend.

‘We were concerned that having worked so hard with Doncaster and others in racing to restore the status of the race, the move could lead to conflicts of interests for many in the build-up to the race and on the day itself.

‘The easy thing to do would be to walk away from the Leger now that our current agreement has ended. It would save us significant costs and make a clear point about our frustrations with the way in which the race planning developments played out.

‘However, at a time when British Racing and betting operators are working hard to find a sustainable, commercially-based model for our future partnership, and one which addresses the substantial issues arising from the double-whammy of declining consumer interest in betting on racing and increasing costs to betting operators, such a decision would be short-sighted and unhelpful.

‘We want to continue to build the profile of the Ladbrokes St Leger and our successful partnership with ARC.

‘We see this sponsorship renewal as part of a potential template for the way in which betting operators and commercial organisations within British Racing can work together for the long term.

‘All of our sponsorships will now be considered within a wider commercial framework covering other elements of the flow of our funds to parties in British Racing - specifically Levy, Media Rights, Racecourse Data Rights and other media / advertising spend.’

Ladbrokes spokesman David Williams said the firm would continue to monitor the effect of the fixture clash despite the initial encouraging figures.

He added: ‘Irish Champions weekend is not going to get any smaller nor is its marketing spend. We will be watching the situation going forward.’
