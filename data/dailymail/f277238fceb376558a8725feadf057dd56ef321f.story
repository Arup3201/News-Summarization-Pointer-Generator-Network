Vasyl Lomachenko has beaten Gary Russell by majority decision to win the vacant WBO featherweight title in Carson City, California.

The Ukrainian dropped a split decision to Orlando Salido in March but, after the Mexican fighter was stripped of his belt for failing to make the weight, Lomachenko was handed a second chance against Washington DC's Russell.

While the American did manage to hit his opponent with quick combinations in the early rounds on Saturday night, Lomachenko grew into the bout and scored a left uppercut to the chin before stunning Russell right at the final bell.
