Pardoning a lucky turkey ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday has been a tradition for nearly half a century, started by President John F. Kennedy, and carried on by each president since.

But now PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has sent a letter to the president imploring him to put a stop to the ‘sorely outdated’ ceremony that ‘makes light of the mass slaughter of some 46million gentle, intelligent birds.’

The animal rights organization asked the president to forego the tradition and instead put a Tofurky roast on the holiday table.

Tasty treat? In 2010, Mr Obama pardoned Apple while his daughters Sasha and Malia look on; he joked in 2009 that they were the reason he didn't eat the pardoned bird

PETA President Ingrid E. Newkirk wrote to Mr Obama, saying that the annual turkey pardon ‘makes light of the mass slaughter’ of each turkey and ‘portrays the United States’ president as being in some sort of business partnership with the turkey-killing industry.’

She wrote that Tofurky – turkey made from tofu – is a ‘delicious, healthy’ alternative to eating a turkey.

By Tuesday night, Ms Newkirk said that she received no official answer from the White House either way, though it seems highly unlikely that Mr Obama would cancel the Wednesday afternoon ceremony.

Earlier Tuesday, the official White House Facebook page posted a picture encouraging users to vote for which turkey should be the official bird of the 2012 holiday – Cobbler or Gobbler.

The White House blog compiled a short biography for the two birds, saying that both were born on a farm in Rockingham County, Virginia.

‘Cobbler and Gobbler may look alike, but they’re no birds of a feather. Cobbler craves cranberries, is known for his strut, and enjoys the musical styling of Carly Simon.

‘Gobbler, a patient but proud bird, loves to nibble on corn and enjoys any music with a fiddle.’

Following the pardoning, both turkeys will be transported to Mount Vernon, the estate of George Washington, where they will be placed in a custom-made pen at the livestock facility.

Mr Obama joked with reporters in 2009 that his daughters Malia and Sasha were the true saviors of the turkey that year. ‘I was ready to eat this sucker,’ he said.

‘I’m told Presidents Eisenhower and Johnson actually ate their turkeys,’ Mr Obama continued. ‘You can’t fault them for that; that’s a good-looking bird.’

Contender: Cobbler is one of the turkeys up to be this year's official turkey, and enjoys strutting and eating cranberries

Competition: Gobbler is also in the running and enjoys fiddle music and corn
