The powers of recovery which have helped keep Kell Brook undefeated through more than 30 professional fights on his climb to world champion status have been revealed as even more special by the announcement that he will return to the ring on March 28.

Brook needed 34 staples in a deep, vicious leg-wound after being stabbed on holiday following his winning of the IBF world welterweight belt from America's Shawn Porter.

There were fears that the injury might be career-threatening, but Brook will be ready in just nine weeks to defend that title in his home town of Sheffield - Special K indeed.

His challenger will be named this Thursday and is expected to one of two Canadian-based boxers, No 1 contender Jo Jo Dan or the more lowly ranked Andonin Decarie.

A statement from Brook's promoter, Matchroom, read: 'Kell Brook will make the first defence of his IBF World Welterweight title on March 28 at the Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield.'

Brook improved his career record to 33-0 when he beat Porter by majority decision in California, but less than a month later, he was in hospital after an incident that left him fearing for his career and even his life.

The 28-year-old said he was the 'victim of an unprovoked attack' in the early hours of September 4, when a conversation between himself and his attacker in the assailant's apartment, following an evening of drinking, turned sour.

Brook lost a lot of blood and had no feeling in the affected area, but has recovered sufficiently to line up a title defence.

He was aiming high in terms of opponents as he began the recovery process, claiming: 'Believe me, I will get better and then I'll smash Amir Khan.

'The dream scenario would then be to fight Floyd Mayweather. I'm a young lion and I believe I can be one of the greats.'

Kell Brook's first world title defence will be televised live on Sky Sports on March 28.
