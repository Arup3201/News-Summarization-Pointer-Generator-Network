A GOP congressman called out Thursday for his party’s unwillingness to end the government shutdown over Obamacare told his CNN interviewer she was pretty but just isn’t getting it.

Indiana Republican Todd Rokita defended the shutdown as preferable to ‘insidious’ Obamacare as comely anchor Carol Costello questioned the ‘divisive approach’ adopted by his party in the fight.

‘Carol, you’re beautiful but you have to be honest as well,’ Rokita said.

Shutdown: Indiana congressman Todd Rokita told CNN host Carol Costello she's pretty but biased

It marked the end of the contentious Thursday morning interview, but it wasn’t the only comment where the congressman attempted to use Costello’s gender against her.

‘I don’t know if you have children yet, I’m sure you don’t have grandchildren yet,’ Rokita said before complimenting Costello youthful looks. ‘But we’re fighting for them. Do you have any idea how much this law is going to cost?’

Costello shot back: ‘Do you know how much it costs every day the government is partially shut down? You’re costing taxpayers millions and millions of dollars!’

The Tea Party firebrand has stepped up as a face of the GOP’s continued refusal to negotiate with Democrats unless Obamacare is delayed or defunded.

Bold statement: Rokita called Obamacare 'one of the one of the most insidious laws ever developed by men'

Rokita called the Affordable Care Act ‘one of the most insidious laws ever developed by man’ in his defense.

Costello also criticized Rokita and the other Republicans who will be paid despite the shutdown, while government workers do not know if or when they will get paid for their furloughed period.

Rokita, in turn, accused Costello of being part of the problem, which she called ‘too easy.’

After Rokita made his ‘you’re beautiful’ comment, Costello raised an eyebrow and ended the interview.

Like the battle over Obamacare, this fight culminated with a shutdown.
