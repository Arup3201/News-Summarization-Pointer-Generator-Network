A farmer cutting some firewood with a 
powerful electric circular saw swears he'll never touch a power tool 
again after the blade slipped and buried itself in his stomach.

Gregory Steinmedc, 56, amazingly survived the horrific accident.

He was rushed to a hospital 30 miles from his remote home with the electric saw blade still jammed 10cm deep in to his flesh.

Impaled: Brazilian farmer Gregory Steinmedc lies with the blade of the circular saw embedded in his stomach

The Brazilian farmer, from 
Campina Mission, was taken to a hospital in Santa Rosa, and surprised 
even the doctors that he didn't slice anything vital.

Mr Steinmedc told a local reporter that he'll never use a power tool again.

He said: 'Never again. That I swear and I stand by that. I will not use them any more. I can see that it is dangerous.'

The farmer used the circular saw to cut firewood in the shed home when he suffered the accident.

He called to his wife Frida for help, she had learned some first aid during a driving course.

Gregory said that Santa Rose hospital was two hours away, and he had to make the trip with the saw still attached to his stomach.

He said: 'I had faith. I am strong - not afraid to die.'

The
operation to remove it lasted for two more hours. According to the 
surgeon Maurice Romano, responsible for the procedure, the cut was 10cm 
in depth, but had not pierced any vital organs.

He
said the actions of the farmer's wife and nurses who initially 
administered treatment to stop bleeding while he was still in Campina 
Mission saved his life.
