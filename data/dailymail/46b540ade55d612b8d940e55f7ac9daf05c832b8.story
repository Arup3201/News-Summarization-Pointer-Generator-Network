Manchester City will play in all blue next season as they attempt to defend their Premier League title.

City have released their new kit for the season which features shorts that are the same colour as the shirt - a departure from last season's white shorts.

The Nike kit also has a darker v-neck collar and the sleeves have a dark edging, too.

Inside the back of the neck is a dark blue pennant tab with the bold statement 'We are City' in laser blue.

The kit features Nike's Dri-Fit technology which helps sweat evaporate quicker and has laser-cut ventilation holes to increase circulation.

The kit will be available for pre-order from July 10 and go on sale on July 17.

City begin the new season against Arsenal in the Community Shield before starting their title defence away to Newcastle on August 16.
