From snowmen to penguins and Father Christmas, festive jumpers have become a seasonal staple thanks to their cosy warmth and innocent motifs.

But one Scottish pensioner had a slightly naughtier scenario in mind when she created her range of reindeer themed knits.

Instead of an classic snowy scene, grandmother-of-nine Jen Barrett's festive jumpers feature a pair of reindeers enjoying a private moment.

The £34.99 knit, which comes in a range of festive colours, including red, navy and green, also includes a classic snowflake pattern and is made by helpers supervised by Mrs Barrett.

The pensioner, 75, who hails from the small village of Killearn just outside of Glasgow, set up her Christmas jumper business this year but has been creating knits for her family since 2008.

So popular did the creations prove, grandson Ben Greenock persuaded her to join forces with him to sell the knits online.

Luckily for those with delicate stomachs, the Woopwoo range also includes designs featuring reindeers in less compromising situations, as well as traditional snowmen and Christmas trees.

But it's the 'humping reindeer' motif that has proved most popular, with Mrs Barrett's husband Ken among fans of the design.

'Why not spread the joy and delight that 
my jumpers bring to people across the world?' said the unrepentant Mrs Barrett of her naughty range of knits.

'While my cheeky ‘humping reindeer’ might not be to everyone’s taste, it does highlight that 
Christmas is about both giving and receiving.'
