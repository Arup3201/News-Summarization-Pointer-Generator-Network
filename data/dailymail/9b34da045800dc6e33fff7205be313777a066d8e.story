Council plans to change the name of Welsh village Varteg to Farteg have been dropped due to 'overwhelming' public opposition.

Welsh language campaigners had argued the name change was necessary because there is no 'v' in ancient Welsh.

However the 1,000 villagers protested, arguing that the name Farteg would make them the butt of schoolboy jokes, as people unfamiliar with the nuances of Welsh pronunciation would say it as 'Fart Egg'.

Due to 'overwhelming' opposition, plans to rename Welsh village Varteg as Farteg have been dropped

Welsh language campaigners argued that Farteg would be more accurate as there was no 'v' in ancient Welsh

After receiving a letter with 150 signatures opposing the plans, local councillor Richard Clark agreed that the new name could bring the town and villagers into 'disrepute'.

He added: 'Whilst we in Wales understand the pronunciation, outsiders will say it Fart-egg.'

The change was asked for because most Welsh street signs display place names in both English and Welsh.

At the time Sioned Jones, 42, who lives in the village near Pontypool, South Wales, said: 'Just imagine how embarrassing it will be to have the word "fart" in your village's name - never mind being followed by "egg".

The 1,000 residents opposed because they were worried that outsiders would pronounce it 'Fart Egg'

Local councillor Giles Davies has hailed the decision as a 'victory for common sense'

'I'd be humiliated every time I told someone my address. Everyone will be laughing at us and coming to get photographed next to the street signs.

'I just think it's ridiculous - these Welsh language campaigners are a lot of gasbags, theyâ€™re full of hot air.'

Fellow villager Ray Leyshon, 62, said: 'Can you imagine the bus going past and some naughty schoolboy shouting: "You are going to Fart Egg". It is just a bad joke.'

Following the decision to keep the name Varteg, councillor Giles Davies hailed a victory for 'common sense.'

Speaking to the BBC, he added: 'It's one thing for an outsider to say they have got to do it, it's the law, but if you live in the village and you don't want this change it's a different story.'

While the villagers of Varteg may have narrowly escaped the humiliation of being called 'Fart Egg' by passersby, spare a thought for the residents of these unfortunately named places.

Sitting between Dorchester and Poole, the hamlet of Shitterton has been voted as officially the most embarrasing place to live by ancestry website www.findmypast.co.uk.

The tiny hamlet gets its unfortunate name from a literal translation from French, which meant it sat astride a sewer.

It is probably best not to speculate as to how Slack Bottom, near Burnley got its name, though it could just be an unfortunate counterpart to the nearby Slack Top.

Schoolboy taunts could also be levelled at places such as Upperthong, in West Yorkshire, Bushy Gap, in Northumberland, and Fannyfield in the Scottish highlands.

The town of Sandy Balls misses out on the dubious accolade of most appropriate place name, because it is sadly at the wrong end of the New Forest, and therefore not next to the beach.
