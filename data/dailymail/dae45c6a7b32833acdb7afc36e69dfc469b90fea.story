A study's shown that a husband's 'agreeable personality' and good health plays a key role in preventing conflict (illustrated) in a marriage

The stresses and strains of modern living mean that plenty of people seek a divorce.

And a new study has shown that a husband’s ‘agreeable personality’ and good health plays a key role in preventing conflict and an enduring marriage.

Scientists believe the same characteristics in wives play less of a role in limiting conflict between couples who have been together for a long time, however.

‘Wives report more conflict if their husband is in poor health,’ said James Iveniuk, PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago.

‘If the wife is in poor health, there doesn't seem to be any difference in terms of the quality of the marriage for the husband,’ he said.

The study is based upon a U.S. survey analysing the relationships of 953 heterosexual couples who are either married or living together.

Participants ranged in age from 63 to 90 years old and the average length of their relationships was 39 years.

The survey of older adults participating in the National Social Life Health and Aging Project, which ran the survey, compared the characteristics of the husbands to the characteristics of their wives.

Each person was interviewed and asked to describe themselves.

Mr Iveniuk and his co-authors found many gender differences when they examined personality traits including openness, experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and anxiety.

They added a new measure called ‘positivity,’ which was an overarching characteristic described as a person's overall desire to be seen in a positive light.

'Wives report more conflict if their husband is in poor health,' said James Iveniuk, PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago. The study quizzed men and women who ranged in age from 63 to 90 years old who are in a relationship that has lasted for an average of 39 years

A husband's good healthy plays a key role in preventing conflict in a long marriage.

Wives report more conflict if their husband is ill.If a wife is in poor health there is little difference in terms of the quality of the marriage for the husband.

Similarly, wives whose husbands show higher levels of positivity reported less conflict in the marriage but their positivity had no association with their husband's perception of problems.

‘Wives whose husbands show higher levels of positivity reported less conflict. However, the wives' positivity had no association with their husbands' reports of conflict,’ he said.

Co-author Linda Waite, Lucy Flower Professor of Urban Sociology at the university, said the study's measurement of marital conflict could be summarised as, ‘How much does your spouse bother you?’

They found that clashes are not primarily about fighting or violence, but whether one spouse criticises the other, makes too many demands, or generally gets on the other person's nerves.

It also revealed that men who describe themselves as neurotic or extroverted tend to have wives who complain more about the quality of the marriage.

Men with self-described neurotic wives may consider worrying to be a more ‘gender-appropriate’ role for women, according to the study.

Husbands reported more criticism and demands from their wives overall, but also higher levels of emotional support.

'Wives whose husbands show higher levels of positivity reported less conflict (illustrated). However, the wives' positivity had no association with their husbands' reports of conflict,' according to the study

Professor Waite said: ‘Several previous studies have been about the implications of marital status on health.

‘This research allows us to examine individual marriages and not “married people.” We have the reports on the quality of the marriage from each person, about their own personality and their own health.’

The researchers suggest that future studies might examine the question of whether low levels of conflict in marriages require not only the absence of factors, such as poor health and negative traits, but also a better balance of emotional responsibilities between husbands and wives.

They believe some of the differences between husbands and wives may change as researchers study younger couples entering later life, compared to the current generation of older couples who may have more conventional gender roles.

Married women are 28 per cent less likely to die from heart disease than unmarried women - and it's all down to nagging.

Researchers say that even though marriage makes no difference to women's chances of developing heart disease, they are more likely to get treatment early is a partner constantly encourages them to.

They also believe that getting married can lead to lifestyle changes and mean women are more likely to take medication.

The scientists behind the study admit they do now know the reasons for this difference.

However, Dr Sarah Floud and colleagues at Oxford University's Cancer Epidemiology Unit suggest one explanation could be that the partners of married women may encourage them to seek early medical treatment for symptoms.

'Married women were no less likely to develop heart disease than women who were not married, but they were less likely to die from it,' Dr Floud said.

'This means that, over 30 years, about three in 100 married women would die from heart disease compared with about four in 100 women who are not married or living with a partner.'

Other studies have also shown that partners tend to encourage their spouses to take medication and make changes in unhealthy lifestyles.

The findings come from the latest analysis of data from a large UK study of women's health run by Oxford University researchers, the Million Women Study.
