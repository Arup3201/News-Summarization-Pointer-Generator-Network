On trial: Karen Cosford, 47, allegedly wrote saucy love notes to a convicted rapist she had a relationship with

A nurse at a high security prison accused of having a sexual relationship with an inmate allegedly wrote love letters to the prisoner.

Karen Cosford, 47, told the court that she had been forced to write the letter addressed to convicted rapist Brian McBride, which included a promise of ‘the most sensual and close sex you have ever had’.

The unsigned letter was discovered as officers searched for contraband when concerns were raised about McBride’s unsupervised access to areas on the healthcare wing at high security Wakefield Prison, where he was an inpatient.

Allegedly written by Mrs Cosford, 47, the letter includes some very graphic expressions such as: ‘When I think of you inside me it brings a smile to my heart’ and ‘I will rag you around’.

The letter was read out to the jury at Leeds Crown Court today where Cosford stands charged with misconduct in a public office over the alleged sexual relationship with McBride and supplying him with a mobile phone.

Carolyn Falloon, 50, Jacqueline Flynn, 46, and David Sunderland, 49, who all worked on the wing, are also standing trial charged with one or both of the following offences - failing to notify prison authorities about the sexual relationship between Cosford and McBride, and failing to tell them McBride had a mobile phone.

The note, recited to the jury by Prosecutor Richard Wright, read: ‘Right, I’m finding it difficult to write this note. I know how you feel but don’t know how to say it.

‘I realise it took us a long time to get it together and I have given you some terrible times in that period but we have come though it together and much stronger.

‘I didn’t realise how much I do miss you until I went on holiday. I could not get you out of my head and heart, everything I did you were at the forefront of my mind. I was looking forward to seeing you again.

‘My heart sank when you didn’t reply to my text messages. I really thought it was the end.

‘I felt happy and elated when I first 
saw you when I got back to work - such a warm and wonderful feeling 
inside when I knew we were okay...

‘You are my world now, and in the future together, through good and bad times - hopefully more good times than bad.

‘You
understand me more than anyone, we can have a wonderful future together
everything we talked about will happen, just give it time...

Charged: Mrs Cosford is accused of exchanging intimate text messages on a smuggled mobile phone and writing love letters during her relationship with convicted rapist Brian McBride

‘I can’t wait for us to continue our relationship outside of the confines of this place...

‘I never want to jeopardise you getting out, it would break my heart.

‘You are my knight in shining armour, who would have ever thought - you and me.

‘When I think of you inside me it brings a smile to my heart. It’s a wonderful thought...’

The letter also includes indications of a sexual relationship where the author has written: I will rag you around - only kidding - it will be the most sensual and close sex you have ever had.

‘You are the most understanding, patient, manly kind man that I have ever known.

‘I’m committed to this 100 per cent, don’t ever forget that, I love you dearly with all my heart xxx.’

Love nest: Wakefield Prison, the maximum security jail where Karen Cosford allegedly had a relationship with to convicted rapist Brian McBride and smuggled him a mobile phone

The letter was collected in September 2009, along with a number of other items found in a 1kg bag of sugar in the kitchen of the health care centre.

The bag also contained top-up receipts for a mobile phone, written instructions on how to unlock a phone, a top-up card and scraps of paper with an address and telephone numbers on.

There was also a handwritten note saying: ‘You are in my heart, Sorry I’ve been [unreadable], don’t mean to. Will miss you tomorrow. C u soon, Me’

Allegations: Jacqueline Flynn 46, arrives at Leeds Crown Court where she faces accusations alongside fellow prison workers Carolyn Falloon, 50, and David Sunderland, 48  that they wilfully neglected their duty

Cosford denies having a sexual relationship with McBride, failing to notify authorities that he had a phone and purchasing top-ups for him.

Falloon denies failing to notify authorities about the relationship and the phone, and purchasing top-ups.

Flynn denies failing to notify authorities about the relationship and the phone.

Sunderland denies failing to notify authorities about the phone.

Despite this, prosecutors said Flynn admitted during police interviews that she stood guard outside McBride’s cell while the pair were inside - and heard the ‘jangling’ of Cosford’s keys - while Falloon told police she had disturbed them having sex.

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
