A 32-year-old model who held the record for the world's largest implants has walked away from a car crash after her breasts acted as an airbag.

Sheyla Hershey, who has 38KKK breasts, was driving home near Houston, Texas, after a Super Bowl party on Sunday when she crashed into a tree.

The mother was charged with drunk-driving after the incident and allegedly was not wearing a seatbelt when she lost control of her Ford Mustang.

'I think my breasts saved my life,' 
she told Barcroft Media. 'The accident was bad and my boobs are sore, 
but they protected the rest of me.'

Her car spun around and hit a tree 
during the crash but she denied the drunk-driving charge in court on 
Monday, reported the Daily Mirror.

Despite the crash Hershey, who once had 38MMM breasts, avoided injury because her huge bust protected the rest of her body from harm.

She claimed she doesn't ever drink alcohol and passed the breathalyser test issued by police, reported the New York Post.

She told Radar Online that she took 
drugs for her bipolar, depression, headaches and backaches, which may 
have caused the confusion.

Texas law states you can be charged with driving while intoxicated if you are impaired by drugs or legal medications even within the legal limit.

‘The state will now have to prove that the medication caused impairment,’ her lawyer Paul Kendall told Radar Online.

Hershey was released on bail and is due to appear in Montgomery County Court next month on March 28, reported the Daily Mirror.

Montgomergy County Court records show Steinberg lives in Humble, 20 miles north of Houston, and her case was heard by Judge Keith Stewart.

A request for comment and more details on
 the case today to Montgomery County Sheriff's Office by MailOnline was not 
immediately returned.

An infection that set in after her 30th 
breast enlargement operation led 5ft 3in Hershey to undergo an emergency
 operation in June 2010.

That left her with unattractive sagging skin where her implants had been, but she was obsessed with maintaining her Guinness World Record.

'Not having my breasts was killing me, I didn't know if I could make it through 2012 without them,' Hershey said last November.

'My breasts had become part of me and I was deformed without them. It is a miracle. I never thought I would have my breasts back again.'

She ignored the wishes of doctors and her
 husband Derek, 29 - who all feared the trauma of yet more surgery could
 cause a new infection.

Hershey organised a tour of cosmetic surgery practitioners in Latin America last September and went to Cancun, Mexico, for the operation.

She had 2,500cc of saline liquid implanted into her breasts, before having more saline gradually introduced in her hometown of Vitoria, Brazil.

'I increased slowly over a two-month period and now my breasts are back at 4,300cc of liquid and are 38KKK,' Hershey said.

Hershey, who has spent $100,000 in a decade to maintain her breasts, wants more surgery this year to take her breasts back up to 38MMM.
