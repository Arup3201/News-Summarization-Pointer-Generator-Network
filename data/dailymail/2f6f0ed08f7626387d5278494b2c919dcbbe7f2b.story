A University of Georgia student whose body was found in a creek close to her home last month had taken her own life.

Rebecca Elaine Greene died from hypothermia and severe intoxication of Benadryl, the chief medical officer ruled yesterday.

The 22-year-old is said to have fallen into the cold stream on November 19 after intentionally taking a large quantity of diphenhydramine.

Search: Rebecca with her boyfriend, who reported her missing and had been trying to find her when the body was discovered

Miss Greene was reported missing by her boyfriend, who has not been named, on the morning she was found, after she failed to come home on Monday night.

The student, who was described as an environmental advocate, had sent him a text message at about 5.30pm saying she planned to walk or take the bus home, according to Red and Black.

When his texts and calls to her went unanswered he contacted her parents at 11.30pm and went door to door asking neighbors if they had seen or heard anything.

Her body was found by investigators who traced her through her cell phone. An officer found her body in the creek and bicycle on the bank, not far from the house she shared with two friends, Fox 5 reported.

Police said early on that they didn't suspect foul play, but the results of her death have only just been revealed.

Miss Greene's face and head had not been covered by water in the creek and she did not drown, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

'According to Dr. Sperry, the death 
occurred when Miss Greene inadvertently fell in to a cold stream after 
intentionally consuming very large quantities of diphenhydramine,' 
spokeswoman Sherry Lang told the Atlanta Constitution-Journal.

'The university expresses its sorrow at the loss of life, particularly a young life,' university president Jere Morehead said in a statement about Miss Greene, who loved horses and travel.
