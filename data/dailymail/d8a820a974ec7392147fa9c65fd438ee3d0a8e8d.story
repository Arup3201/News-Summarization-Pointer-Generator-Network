Boris Johnson will throw down the gauntlet to David Cameron – by warning that Brussels will only give him a better deal if he threatens to pull Britain out of the EU.

In a major speech this week, the London mayor will back a report concluding that a British exit from the European Union would be better for the country than staying in an unreformed institution.

The study, by the Mayor’s economic adviser, banker Gerard Lyons, says that leaving the EU is ‘definitely a viable option’ and comes a ‘very close second’ to staying in a successfully reformed Union.

Mr Johnson is expected to say that the UK should ‘not be frightened’ of leaving the EU – a stark contrast to the position of the Prime Minister, who has always said he wants Britain to stay in.

It comes amid growing speculation that the London mayor, and possible future Tory leadership challenger, will announce plans to return as an MP next year.

Mr Cameron has pledged a referendum on EU membership by 2017, following Brussels reforms including a crackdown on benefit tourism.

But the Mayor is understood to believe that Mr Cameron’s strategy will not guarantee success.

A source close to Mr Johnson told the Sunday Times that he believes Mr Cameron must be ‘bold’ in his demands in the renegotiation of the UK’s EU membership he has promised if Conservatives win next year’s general election.

Mr Johnson is understood to believe that the best way of achieving this is by showing he has ‘no fear’ of departure if the talks fail to deliver.

‘Boris favours a renegotiation in which we stay in and complete the common market,’ the source said.

‘He believes that is achievable by being bold about that renegotiation and not having that fear about leaving. If voters say that’s not enough and we leave, the longer-term aspects of that are not as damaging as people might imagine.’ 

Mr Johnson is expected to endorse a list of eight demands for reform proposed by Mr Lyons which go beyond what the Prime Minister has publicly set out.

It is believed that the Lyons Report finds that London’s GDP of £350billion – around a fifth of the UK economy – can be expected to grow to £640billion by 2034 if Britain stays in a reformed EU which allows a new orientation towards trade with growing markets in the rest of the world.

It would still expand to £614billion if the UK quit Brussels to pursue its own trade-friendly policies.

However, if Britain stayed in an unreformed EU, London’s GDP could be expected to grow to just £495billion over the same period. And leaving the EU but failing to adopt a more outward-looking trade policy would limit it to £430billion.

Mr Lyons said: ‘The best economic scenario for Britain over the next 20 years is to be in a significantly reformed European Union.

‘But if, as an alternative, the UK leaves the EU on good terms, while adopting sensible outward-looking trading policies, that comes a very close second.’ 

He added: ‘Britain can only achieve meaningful EU reform if it’s serious about leaving. Our detailed study shows it’s definitely a viable option for the UK to be outside the EU.’ 

Mr Cameron has said he hopes to be able to recommend voters opt to stay in the EU in the in/out referendum he has promised for 2017, following the planned renegotiation. 

Mr Johnson’s expected comments are likely to increase pressure on him to make clear to EU counterparts that he is ready to recommend withdrawal if the renegotiation fails to deliver the reforms he wants.

Matthew Elliott, of the pro-reform group Business for Britain, said: ‘Failure to change the damaging status quo of our relationship with the EU poses a huge threat to British business and in particular Britain’s financial services.

‘The mayor is absolutely right that we should seek serious reforms of our relationship with the EU, but also that we should not be afraid of the prospect of Britain leaving a stagnant EU.

‘As Business for Britain research has shown, the City faces huge and growing threats from the eurozone. We need a robust strategy to bring back powers to the UK and make the EU more competitive, but this will only be possible if Britain is serious about leaving if the EU fails to reform.’
