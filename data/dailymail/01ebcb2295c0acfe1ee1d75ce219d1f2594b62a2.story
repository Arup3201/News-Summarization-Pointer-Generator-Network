Jessica Ennis-Hill has returned to training and is already counting down to defending her Olympic heptathlon title in Brazil in 2016 following the best part of a year away from competition.

Ennis-Hill gave birth to son Reggie in July and on Tuesday announced her preparations for Rio de Janeiro have begun.

'Back in the gym ... building back into training,' she posted with an image of herself on Instagram. 'Exciting and slightly scary!

'My journey to Rio starts now.'

Ennis-Hill confirms her London 2012 heptathlon gold, a title she aims to retain in Rio de Janeiro in 2016

Ennis-Hill denied herself a virtually certain Commonwealth Games gold medal to start a family but has her heart set on repeating her London dominance of the multi-event in Rio. 

The 28-year-old's 2012 gold came with a British and Commonwealth record score of 6,955 points, with her event-closing 800m victory among the Games most enduring highlights. 

Ennis-Hill was disappointed to miss the 2013 World Championships due to an Achilles tendon injury but in January her personal life took precedence over European Championships and Commonwealth Games.
