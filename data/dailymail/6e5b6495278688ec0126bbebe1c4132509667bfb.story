Blackpool hauled themselves off the foot of the Championship - and reminded the division that they will continue to battle through adversity - as they recorded a first win of the season on a highly-charged evening.

Hundreds of Blackpool supporters opted to show their disdain at the way in which the club was run, with fans flocking towards the Bloomfield Road concourses beyond the 53rd minute and staging a walkout in protest at the Oyston family’s regime.

A plan devised to unnerve their unpopular owners actually served to stir the XI battling for the cause. Eleven minutes after the chanting for chairman Karl Oyston and his father Owen to vacate the club, Blackpool's Francois Zoko waltzed his way into the Cardiff box to score.

It was fitting that as Zoko twirled away to celebrate his first goal for the club, a banner reading ‘#footballfirst’ - the supporters’ trust’s mantra endorsed by club president Valeri Belokon - was being flourished wildly in a sparsely populated East stand.

On the day that Owen insisted the ruling family weren’t thieving from a club to have seen next to no financial strengthening after their Premier League windfall, Blackpool showed they are not robbing a place in the second tier.

They possessed heart and a willingness to fight for their manager, Jose Riga, and were the better side against Cardiff, who have been in disarray themselves but not to anywhere near the same level. 

As home fans left their seats to make a way down towards the pitch screaming ‘You greedy b****** - get out of our club,’ Owen, 80, cut a frail figure in the directors’ box. There was more than just a point these hardy souls wanted to get across - they are trying to effect change.

Whether they will or not remains to be seen, but the smoke bombs, black balloons and consistent songs made sure those who weren’t already aware of their predicament certainly are now.

The Seasiders were  the more dangerous throughout the match. Ishmael Miller - a thorn in the away side all night - couldn’t connect with a Tony McMahon centre as the hosts appeared buoyed by the loud and consistent chants for regime change.

Nathan Delfouneso felt he ought to have been awarded a penalty just before the half-hour mark, when former Manchester United left back Fabio appeared to sweep his legs from underneath. When you’re rooted to the bottom, these finer decisions tend to go the other way.

Edu Oriol - whose twin Joan was forced off injured earlier in the piece - somehow stepped over the ball six yards out when all he had to do was hammer home.

Cardiff did have their chances too. Sean Morrison might have opened the scoring but headed wide; Kenwyne Jones then skied over the bar from seven yards out, so too Aron Gunnarsson just outside the box.

Blackpool equipped themselves well and a significant hat tip must go to the beleaguered Riga for that. The Belgian inherited a squad that lost no fewer than 27 players before pre-season and then found communication with chairman Karl Oyston completely break down over the club's infamous transfer policy.

Riga had just eight senior professionals with under a fortnight to go until the opening game of the season. To have six points and be off the bottom at this stage is a minor miracle.

Trevor Sinclair, who began his career on the Fylde Coast, told the situation best. ‘It’s unacceptable at this level. For me Riga has done a very good job. He’s got them playing and is starting to turn the tide.’

Fabio was cleverly played in by Ravel Morrison but his shot was deflected wide, with John Brayford’s effort from the resulting corner well blocked before the only goal.

Then Zoko picked up the ball just outside the box with 64 minutes on the clock. The former Stevenage man drove at the backpedalling Morrison before firing beneath David Marshall.

Those who had congregated at the bottom of the Jimmy Armfield stand couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

Adam Le Fondre missed a great chance to equalise for the visitors late on at Bloomfield Road

Their hastily-assembled back four - alongside goalkeeper Elliott Parish making his debut at this level - needed to remain firm. Federico Macheda and Anthony Pilkington both had chances, before Delfouneso somehow smashed straight at Marshall from four yards.

That miss could have been costly, but it was the Lancashire team’s night after Parish made a super stop to deny substitute Adam Le Fondre and the striker then fired over unmarked.

To put this result into perspective, it is Blackpool’s first win in 160 days. Riga will hope for more, and quickly. Perhaps the Oystons are wondering what might have been had they put hands in pockets over the summer.
