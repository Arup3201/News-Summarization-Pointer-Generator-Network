The last suspect being hunted in connection with a brutal attack on a father of four in his family home has been arrested in a dramatic armed police raid.

Oskar Pawlowichz, a Polish national, is suspected of being involved in a violent burglary in which a gang of masked men forced their way into the £2 million home of law lecturer Paul Kohler in Wimbledon, South-West London.

Mr Kohler fought with his attackers like ‘an Englishman defending his castle’ but was left needing facial-reconstruction surgery after the assault, during which he suffered a fractured eye socket.

Oskar Pawlowichz was arrested in a dramatic police raid after a Mail on Sunday appeal brought new information forward

Officers from the Metropolitan and West Mercia Police arrested Pawlowichz at a five-bedroom house in Leominster, Herefordshire, on Tuesday night.

Pawlowichz, 29, was found after a £5,000 reward offered by The Mail on Sunday brought forward new information which led detectives to his location.

A 20-strong covert police team had been watching the three-storey property throughout the day and descended on the address at 8.30pm when they received confirmation the suspect was inside.

Six armed police entered the house where they found Pawlowichz with three other Polish nationals who were also living there. 

He surrendered to police and later emerged from the house with his head bowed, led in handcuffs by two detectives.

Paul Kohler was left with horrendous facial injuries when the four masked men broke into his home 

The Met Police had mounted a month-long manhunt for Pawlowichz after the attack on Mr Kohler on August 11.

The breakthrough came after detectives were informed he was at an address in Leominster by a member of the public in response to the reward offered for information by The Mail on Sunday.

Last night, Cambridge-educated Mr Kohler, 55, praised police efforts as he revealed that doctors have told him he will be left with permanent double vision from the assault. 

He said: ‘I’m very thankful to the police and delighted with the arrest. It makes my family rest a lot easier.

‘But I’ve still got double vision because the doctors wouldn’t operate due to the strain on my heart, which is difficult because I’ve got a permanent reminder.’

Mr Kohler told how he fought for his life with his attackers, explaining: ‘I had my family there and this whole notion of an Englishman’s home is his castle – that was the feeling. ‘

Detective Inspector Dan O’Sullivan, who has led the investigation, added: ‘This has been a complex and intensive month-long search which has had Met officers across the country tracking the suspect’s whereabouts. 

Finally, he was arrested with no injuries to the public or police officers.’

Pawlowichz appeared in Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court on Thursday, charged with aggravated burglary and grievous bodily harm with intent.

Three other Polish men have also been arrested in relation to the incident. Two of the suspects have appeared in court. The third has been released on bail pending further inquiries.
