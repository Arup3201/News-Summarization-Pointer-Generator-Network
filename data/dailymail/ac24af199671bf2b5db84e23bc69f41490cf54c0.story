A missing dog whose devastated owners staged the UK's first reconstruction of an animal crime have finally being reunited with their pet after it was found 80 miles away from the family home.

The Marsh family of Woking, Surrey, spent £4,000 by shooting a video reconstruction of the moment three-year-old border terrier Toby was snatched and even funded a fly-by banner featuring his name in a desperate attempt to be reunited with the pet.

They also launched a huge campaign on social media using the hashtag #FindToby, which was backed by tennis player Andy Murray, comedian Alan Carr and boyband One Direction.

Lost dog Toby has been reunited with the Marsh family - including baby Pippa - after a huge search for him

Toby back at the family home with owner Louise  Marsh after he was found after going missing for three weeks

The dog was found in a park after Mrs Marsh organised a huge campaign to find him on social media, arranged for a plane to fly a banner in the skies over her town and even staged her own Crimewatch-style reconstruction

However, today Louise Marsh received the call she never thought would come, when a vet's surgery in Kent contacted her to say they had Toby.

And straight away Mrs Marsh jumped into her car and drove the 80 miles from her home to go and collect her pet, which had been found running around on a nearby field.

Mrs Marsh, 28, said: 'I received a telephone call from a vet in Kent who said they had a border terrier who looked exactly like Toby.

'They said he was fine and had been running around a nearby field playing with a Jack Russell, when a lady noticed him and took him to the vet.

'I drove down there straight away and collected him and we only just brought him home earlier this evening.

'He has been begging for treats ever since.'

The family said their three-legged rescue dog, Peggy, had been pining for Toby ever since he went missing

The dog was taken to this vet surgery in Kent after being found playing on a nearby field. The surgery then called Mrs Marsh, who went to pick him up

 Toby, a pedigree animal, slipped out of the front door when Mrs Marsh was distracted by her six-month-old daughter, Pippa.

A local boy found the terrier and, suspecting he was lost, put him on a lead and started knocking on doors looking for the owner.

A man sitting in a nearby silver estate car overheard and offered to take Toby to a vet to see if there was an identifying microchip implanted under his skin. Toby, who was wearing a green suede collar, has not been seen since.

The man was aged between 40 and 50, with a bald or shaved head. He had a young boy sitting beside him in the car’s front passenger seat

Mrs Marsh, a vet, spent £4,000 in her campaign to find her border terrier, missing for three weeks.

A family have filmed a Crimewatch-style reconstruction of the alleged dognapping of their beloved pet. The film shows a youth hand the dog to a driver, who offered to take it to a vet. The dog has not been seen since

A reconstruction of the moment Toby went missing in Woking has taken place in a bid to jog people's memory 

There were leaflets — 10,000 of them — and a campaign on social media, and a firm of pet detectives. 

At the weekend she staged a Crimewatch–style re-enactment of his theft to jog memories, and spent £650 to fly a banner appealing for information about her pet behind an aircraft circling her home town of Woking.

But now that Toby is back at home with Mrs Marsh and her husband Les, she says that every penny spent was worth it.

She explained: 'One hundred per cent I would do it all again if he were to go missing.

'It has been worth it, especially when I saw his face when I went to pick him up. I would have spent £10,000 if it meant getting him back.

The family even paid for a plane to fly over Woking with a banner in a bid to raise awareness of their search

As well as putting up posters, Mrs Marsh made video appeals and took to social media in a bid to find Toby

She added: 'Every time I see him now I just can't believe he is back. I was always hopeful he would come back but as the weeks went on it looked less likely.

'He is definitely getting to sleep upstairs in the bed with us tonight. He isn't normally allowed but my husband said if we got him back he could so I am holding him to that!' 

This week, campaigners at the Stolen and Missing Pets Alliance called for anyone convicted of stealing a dog to be jailed for at least six weeks, after reports of the crime increased by more than a third over the past two years. 

In particular, ‘theft by finding’ is said to be on the rise — where people who claim to have innocently come across a dog demand money for its return.

From April 2016, all dogs will be required to have an identification microchip inserted under the skin, partly to combat such crimes. But already these chips are being removed by thieves.

Despite the huge scale of efforts to find the dog, the animal has not been handed into vets and remains lost
