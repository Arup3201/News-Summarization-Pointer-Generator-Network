The Belarusian showed off her dancing skills to a packed Margaret Court Arena in Melbourne on Thursday night after dumping eighth seed Caroline Wozniacki  in straight sets. 

Azarenka hugged her opponent and friend before holding her hands victoriously up in the air as she danced with her racket, much to the delight of the crowd.

The former world number one, who split with boyfriend of two years Redfoo last year, shook her hips as fans cheered her on.

'I just love to dance,' she said on court after her win.

'When I watch tennis on the TV they always show people in the crowd dancing and I just start dancing in my room with the crowd. 

'I just might as well enjoy myself on the court.'

She's no stranger to the odd dance or two especially if a victory is involved.

The two-time champion arrived in Melbourne unseeded after battling foot and knee injuries  in 2014.

But she looked right at home  and dictated play from the outset to stun Wozniacki and claim her first top 10 scalp in more than a year.

'I'm happy with the way I stayed consistent throughout the whole match,' Azarenka said. 

'I think there's always things you can improve, but it's a great progress from one match to another.'

Azarenka and Wozniacki battled it out on the court but are friends away from the competition 

She said she was pleased with her court game and the intensity she was able to maintain throughout the one hour and 38 minute match.

Azarenka won the Open in 2012 and 2013 and reached the quarter finals last year before injury and illness hit.

'I love the energy of people here,' she said of Australia. 

'I think the whole country is like a sporting nation. I think you feel very excited every time you come here to play.'

Azarenka will next face Czech 25th seed Barbora Zahlavova Strycova in the third round and is on course to take on top seed Serena Williams in the quarter-finals.
