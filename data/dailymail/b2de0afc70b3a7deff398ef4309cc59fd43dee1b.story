Accused: Karl Karlsen is on trial for second-degree murder in the death of his son Levi, who was crushed to death by a truck

Tragic loss: After ten hours interrogation by police, he finally admitted he had been there when the truck fell on his son Levi and had accidentally caused it to happen, before leaving him to die

Second wife: Knowing about the insurance payout on his son, when Cindy, pictured, found out her husband took out a $1.2million policy on her, she grew suspicious and feared for her life

Mother and son: Karl Karlsen is awaiting trial for the murder of his son, Levi, but now his daughter believes that he is also behind his first wife's death in a house fire

Justice for Levi: Karl Karlsen's current wife, Cindy, managed to get him to explain how and why his son Levi was crushed whilst fixing parts underneath a truck

Karlsen was arrested and charged with
second-degree murder and insurance fraud last year after his second 
wife Cindy - fearing for her life - agreed to wear a wire while talking 
to him about his son's death.

A judge ruled recently that the never-before-heard tapes could be used as evidence against him in his trial.

In 2008, Levi Karlsen, 23, was crushed to death when the truck he was working on slipped off its jack and landed on top of him.

His death was initially ruled an accident, but Karlsen collected a $700,000 life insurance payout after the incident, raising suspicions.

A family member tipped off the police about the large insurance policy and opened an investigation into his death last year.

Authorities in California also opened an investigation into the 1991 California house fire that killed Karlsen's wife and Deroche's mother Christina Karlsen.

Karlsen cashed in on a $200,000 life insurance policy soon after.

Did he do it? Karl Karlsen's wife, Christina, died in a house fire but his daughter believes that he may have been responsible for her death

Truth uncovered: Christina Karlsen perished in a house fire whilst her children and husband escaped - but her daughter believes there is more to the story

On the tapes, obtained by ABC's Nightline, the 52-year-old can be heard telling Cindy while they were in a restaurant that he had removed his truck's front tires and raised it on a single jack before Levi volunteered to do the repair.

'I
didn't push the truck, I said,' Karlsen said after Cindy asked him for 
the truth in Levi's death. 'No, I said I had nothing to do -- 
but I said I took advantage of the situation once it happened.'

Police arrested Karlsen soon after and interrogated him for ten hours, in which he denied killing his son 75 times.

In
the police interrogation tapes, also obtained by ABC News, he said: 'I 
found him dead. I f***ing panicked. I don't know. I don't know. I left 
him.'

Confession: After ten hours of interrogation by police, Karlsen finally admitting playing a part in his son's death and leaving him to die

Suspicious: Karl Karlsen's first wife Christina perished in a house fire after she became trapped in the bathroom - the windows of which, Karlsen had boarded up with wood and 17 nails just days before

Finally he told police he had been there when the truck fell on his son and caused it to fall.

'I
opened the truck door because I had to get inside to move the linkage 
for the truck, and when I did, it tipped, and it just, whoosh, f***ing 
fell over,' Karlsen said.

He maintains it was an accident, but did admit that he left his son to die.

'He
did admit that he caused the truck to fall on his son. He did admit 
that he left his son on the floor dying, but he never admitted that it 
was a planned, deliberate act,' said Seneca County Lt Investigator John 
Cleere.

'The officers 
at the scene didn't see anything out of the ordinary,' he told ABC. 
'They saw what appeared to be two grieving parents and what appeared to 
be an accident.'

Knowing 
about the insurance payout on his son, when Cindy found out her husband 
took out a $1.2million policy on her, she grew suspicious and feared for
her life.

Wire-tapped: Karl Karlsen was recorded by his wife explaining how a truck his son was working on was precariously balanced

That's what prompted her to work with
police, leading to second-degree murder and insurance fraud charges 
against Karl Karlsen in the death of his 23-year-old son, Levi.

And
New York and California authorities are now taking a new look at the 
circumstances of the 1991 death of his former wife, Christina Karlsen.

Karlsen has not been charged in relation to anything related to his wife's death.

During the house fire that killed their mother, Christina, was screaming to get the children out of the house.

Christina, was trapped in the bathroom after spilled kerosene 
was ignited by a faulty electric light. Although Karl Karlsen is 
credited with getting Levi and their other two children out safely, 
Christina was unable to escape through the bathroom window because 
Karlsen had boarded it up from the outside days before, saying it was 
broken.

‘At the time, I was six years old. I didn't understand that my mother was behind that wall dying,’ Deroche said.

A week after the fire, Karlsen left California for upstate New York with his three children to be near his family.

As she got older, Deroche said she was
able to process what happened and came to believe that her father 
didn't do enough to help save her mother.

‘You
know, that's not how people are supposed to act when someone they love 
is trapped and literally burning in front of them,’ Deroche said.

It
wasn't until Deroche and her brother Levi were 11 or 12 when she said 
they secretly discussed the possibility that their father wasn't being 
truthful regarding their mother's death.

‘Between
the two of us...we knew, because he didn't try,’ Deroche said. ‘He 
didn't make an effort to save her. He just stood there,’ she told ABC 
News.

However, when she 
and Levi confronted their father, Deroche said, ‘his biggest concern was
that he wondered what the community would think of his own children 
accusing him of murdering their mother.’

Karl Karlsen has been charged with murdering his son and will be reinvestigated for a fire that killed his first wife. He collected insurance payouts on both occasions

After she received the news that Levi 
had died in an apparent accident, Deroche said she tried to put her 
suspicions of Karlsen's involvement in Levi's death at bay, but was 
relieved when she learned about the investigation into her father.

‘It was never a question for me,’ Deroche said. ‘It was a matter of fact.’

When
Karlsen was jailed, Deroche said she went to visit her father and told 
him that she knew he was involved in her mother's and Levi's deaths.

‘He
won't ever own up to Levi,’ Deroche said. ‘But he did tell me… 'It's 
been over 20 years, and they still haven't got me yet. What makes you 
think they're going to get me now?’

Karlsen
will be put on trial in two weeks but  a judge ruled that testimony 
about the California fire and Christina Karlsen's death is off limits.

While
she said she isn't angry with her father, Deroche said she regrets not 
going to police sooner with her suspicions of her mother's death.

‘What if I had said something earlier?’ Deroche said. ‘Maybe he'd still be here for his girls.’
