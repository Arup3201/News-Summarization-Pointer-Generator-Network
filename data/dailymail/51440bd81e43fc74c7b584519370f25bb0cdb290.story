It is the size of a fingernail with battered edges to match.

But this silver coin, discovered in a field, could be worth up to £80,000 if proved to be a genuine Roman antique.

Colin Popplewell, 58, and Mark Hildreth, 38, say the coin - which is the size and weight of a penny - is only the second one in history to be found featuring the short-lived Emperor Proculus.

This is only the second Roman coin ever found featuring the Emperor Proculus. It is estimated to fetch £80,000 at auction, but could go for a lot more. Some experts think it is a 15C forgery

A metal detecting expert, Julian Evan-Hart, certainly believes the coin is genuine and that it was minted to mark the brief rise to power of Proculus in 280AD.

Father-of-two Mr Popplewell, who made the find in a field near Stamford Bridge, East Yorkshire, on November 7, said: 'The first coin with Proculus was found in a collection in Germany in the 1980s. It sold in 1991 for £40,000.

'It was in a private collection that dated back a century so there was no way of validating whether the coin was authentic or a contemporary forgery, made in the Roman times.

'Our find is ground-breaking because it validates the first coin and gives weight to the history of Proculus - it really will change the history books.'

But coin specialist and renowned academic Roger Bland, who is Keeper of the Prehistory and Europe Department of the British Museum, disagrees that the coin is genuine.'

He said: 'I don't believe any coins of Proculus were ever made and this one is probably a 15th century forgery.

'The
only source for our knowledge of him is a controversial history book, 
written at the end of the 4th century AD, much of which was made up.

'It says that there were 30 tyrants who all vied for control of the Roman Empire when things got a bit messy in the late 3rd century AD and lots of people were declared Emperor.

'Many of these 30 tyrants never had coins made, which is a sign of a true Emperor.

'But in the Renaissance, when coin collecting was fashionable, people thought these men should have had coins so they made them.

'This coin has been made from the same dye, or mould, as another in the Munich Museum, which is widely believed to be fake.

Proculus was a Roman usurper who ‘took the purple’ against Emperor Probus in  280AD.

An ambitious soldier, he proclaimed himself joint emperor with Bonosus after being asked by the people of Lugdunum (Lyon), who had started a rebellion against Emperor Probus.

Proculus was married to a woman named Vituriga; at the time of his usurpation he had one son, Herennianus, aged four.

On Probus’ return from fighting in Syria, he forced Proculus to retreat north.

Proculus apparently had some connections to the Franks and he had hoped to rally them to his cause.

They appear, however, to have betrayed him and promptly handed him over to Probus.

Probus had him killed in 281 but spared his family.  Probus was killed by his own troops sometime between September or October 282.

'There is no context to this find either - only single coins, not hoards, have been found so their provenance is difficult to assess.

'Unless someone finds a hoard of these coins, I'm going to remain very sceptical that there were ever any coins made for Proculus.'

Mr Popplewell, a body shop manager, said that when the duo found the coin they didn't recognise the emperor's features.

He and Mr Hildreth photographed the coin out in the field and put the image on a Facebook site used by metal detector specialists.

'We started getting messages back from people telling us that we really should take it to be valued properly. All these figures started coming at us and they're constantly changing, even now.'

Mr Hildreth, a self-employed joiner, added that they would give a proportion of the proceeds to the farmer who owns the field and gave them permission to go detecting.

The lucky duo, of York, will then share the remainder between them 50/50, as they had always agreed.

He explained that a single coin was not considered treasure trove and therefore did not need to go to an inquest, but it had been recorded by the finds liaison officer at the Yorkshire Museum.

Mr Evan-Hart said the find 'made an astounding contribution to world numismatics by this find of a single debased silver coin'.

Christopher Webb, of specialist auctioneers and valuers of coins, Dix Noonan Webb, said it was an 'extremely rare and valuable coin, possibly the second known'.

He said that at auction, it could fetch up to £50,000, but this estimate was later raised to between £60,000 and £80,000.

Mr Popplewell added: 'I probably will be a bit sad to say goodbye to the coin but to be honest it's become a bit of a burden - I'm looking forward to someone taking it off my hands.

'This has definitely whet my appetite for metal detecting - in fact Mark and I were back out with our detectors just after we found the coin.'
