The father of a missing six-year-old girl in Washington state was charged with molesting two young girls over a decade ago, it emerged today.

James Aaron Wright has been co-operating with the investigation into the disappearance of his daughter Jenise, who was last seen by her family on Saturday going to bed in their mobile home in a rural section of Bremerton, near Seattle.

It was not until the little girl missed dinner Sunday night that her parents called police, authorities said.

Desperate
 search: Jenise Wright went missing on Saturday and has not been seen 
since despite a huge search involving the police, FBI, family and local 
volunteers

Dark
 past: James Wright, (pictured with Jenise's mother Denise) was arrested
 in 2000 on felony charges of child molestation. The charges were 
dropped when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge

Today it emerged James Wright, who goes by Jim, was arrested in 2000 on felony charges of child molestation in the first degree after an 8-year-old girl said he inappropriately touched them after a night of drinking.

More than a year later, in June 2001, the charges were amended to include third-degree child molestation after a 15-year-old girl who was babysitting the girl during New Year's Eve 2000 said that Wright touched her breasts and put his hands down her pants.

In court records filed in Whatcom County, Washington, the younger of his accusers said she had reported the incident to her mother who told her she would 'get a spanking' if she spoke of the incident again.

The felony charges against Wright were 
eventually dropped, and he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of 
assault relating to the older child, court records show.

A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire jail time provided he followed certain conditions, including paying fees.

It is not clear why the molestation charges were dropped. But Wright's attorney argued in court records that the young girl later told relatives she had been prompted to lie about the incident.

James Wright and Jenise’s mother, Denise, took lie detector tests Monday but the results were not made public. Law enforcement wouldn't be drawn on Jim's past and referred questions about it to the prosecutor's office.

The Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office, which is leading the investigation aided by the FBI, said both parents were distraught and cooperating fully with police.

Jenise was well-known to all her neighbors, who described her as a talkative child who was unfazed by strangers. It was also not unusual for Jenise to be left without supervision for long periods of time, her parents told investigators. 

Hunt: More than 100 officers and dozens of community volunteers are 
helping authorities search the woods around the Wright family's mobile 
park community in hopes of turning up clues about Jenise's whereabouts

Mystery:
 Investigators were also interviewing all sex offenders in the vicinity 
as well as transients in the mobile park. The family’s home has also 
been searched twice

'She's really independent, she's tenacious,' the little girl's father told KOMO-TV.

More than 100 officers and dozens of community volunteers were helping authorities search the woods around the Wright family's mobile park community in hopes of turning up clues about Jenise's whereabouts.

The girl was either barefoot or in flip-flops upon her disappearance, officials said.

Investigators were also interviewing all sex offenders in the vicinity as well as transients in the mobile park, sheriff’s spokesman Scott Wilson said.

Jenise was the youngest child in the Wright household, a blended family that included both parents and three other siblings under the age of 18, authorities said. Two other adult children also live in the home. It was unclear what her parents did for work.

The family’s home was searched twice and police were keeping a 24-hour blockade around the neighborhood’s perimeter, he said.

James Wright said earlier this week he and his wife were stunned by Jenise’s disappearance.

'My head’s just swimming, I don't know what to think,' Wright told local Fox affiliate Q13. 'She went to bed (Saturday night), she was asleep. Wake up, (and think) she’s probably out running and playing,' he said.

The family has not made a public appearance to plead for help in finding their daughter, but friends and neighbors said they were extremely worried.

Mary Pelnar, 14, said she was friends with Jenise and the girl’s older sister, and described Jim and Denise as being 'like family'.

'I watched her mom sit on the couch and look out the window and not talk, and I've never seen her mom that upset'.

Shortly after Jenise's disappearance, Washington Child Protective Services took an 8-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl from the home.

Deputy Wilson would not disclose why the children were taken but said authorities believed the move was 'prudent'.

Appeal: The family has not made a public 
appearance to plead for help in finding their daughter, but friends and 
neighbors said they were extremely worried

Pelnar said she believed the move left the family torn apart in their darkest hour.

'I think they should have left them with the mom and dad because I've been in that house, and been there enough to know that the parents wouldn't do anything to their kids and it's a safe house,' she said.

Distraught members of the community said their community has always been safe for children, though some questioned why the young girl was allowed to roam for extended periods without checking in with adults.

Ruby Faaita, whose six-year-old daughter Mona is a classmate and friend of the missing girl, said she would not feel comfortable leaving her child with little supervision.

'I can't really say what their position was in it but I wouldn't let my daughter be out that way,' she said.

Jenise is 3 feet tall, weighs 45 pounds and is white, Native American and Filipino. She has black hair and brown eyes.
