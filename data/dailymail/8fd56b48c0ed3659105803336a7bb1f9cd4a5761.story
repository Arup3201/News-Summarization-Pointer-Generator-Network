Uncanny? The shape of the aurora over Iceland resembled the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The supposed appearance of Jesus was captured by Jón Hilmarsson, 48, who was prompted by his ten-year-old son to take photographs of the vivid skies.

Jón said: 'This was the most beautiful and vivid northern light display I have ever seen.

'We usually see green auroras but that night I saw bright green, red and purple colour, which is very unusual. Many people see the shape of Christ but also an angel formation.

'It made me a little bit stressed and also excited to be there and witness this natural phenomenal in the sky, it was a unique night even though we have very often bright and beautiful northern lights in Iceland.

'It was wonderful to photograph, the lights were dancing through the sky and constantly exploding, giving me all kinds of different formation to follow and admire.'
