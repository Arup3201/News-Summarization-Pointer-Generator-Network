More than 260 firefighters are in the Blue Mountains battling an uncontained blaze which has burnt at least 90 hectares so far.

An emergency warning has been issued to residents in Warrimoo and Valley Heights, west of Sydney, as fire crews try to control the blaze on the ground and in the air.

Although a NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman previously told Daily Mail Australia the fire is burning in unreachable bushland and doesn't pose a threat to residential areas, locals have been warned to seek immediate shelter after a change in wind direction caused it to flare up.

The fire, which appeared to be heading towards Baden Place in Blaxland, flared up on Friday night after a southerly change moved through - putting more homes and residents at risk.

As of 10.40pm on Friday night conditions have eased at Warrimoo and Valley Heights but emergency warnings remain in place, according to a tweet from NSW RFS Service.

Fire crew urge residents to remain alert for smoke and burning embers as they hope to undertake backburning overnight if conditions permit.

About 200 firefighters are in the Blue Mountains battling an uncontained blaze which has burnt about 90 hectares so far

A NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the fire is burning in inaccessible bushland

Firefighters in the Blue Mountains are expected to continue fighting the uncontained blaze into the night

The NSW RFS spokesman said the fire is moving in a south-easterly direction and no properties have been damaged 

Across NSW, there are 53 bush and grass fires - 11 of which are uncontained

'The advice is to seek immediate shelter,' a spokesman for NSW Rural Fire Rescue said.

'We are not advising people to leave. Firefighters will be working through the night doing what they can to protect property.'

Although the cause of the fire is unknown, soaring temperatures are believed to have triggered bushfires to break out in the Blue Mountains area.

Due to the blaze, one school was in lockdown and another has been evacuated. 

Warrimoo, east of Katoomba, is under threat from the fast-moving blaze which is sweeping through the district.

The NSW RFS spokesman told Daily Mail Australia about about 5.30pm on Friday the fire is moving in a south-easterly direction and no properties have been damaged.

'The fire is in inaccessible bushland so it's not directly impacting residential areas at this time,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'We're unsure of the cause but at the moment we're focused on containing the fire.'

Fire crew were alerted of the blaze at about 1.20pm on Friday and expect to continue fighting it throughout the night.

'Although conditions may ease up tomorrow with the forecast, we still have a lot to do,' the spokesman said.

Later in the evening, an update from the NSW RFS said 'a southerly change has caused a fire in the area to flare up and it may impact on home'.

Residents on Greens Road in Warrimoo, and Russell Avenue, Coolabah Road and Angophora Place in Valley Heights have been warned of burning embers which are being blown north.

Firefighters and an air crane were sent in to attack the blaze to the east of Greens Road and Florabella Street in Warrimoo, which is believed to be a difficult area to reach.

Blaxland Public has been evacuated over the blaze, which is heading towards Baden Place, while the students at Warrimoo Public have evacuated the grounds.

Warrimoo Public School had previously been in lockdown, with students and teachers taking shelter in the hall. They are now believed to have evacuated the grounds via bus.

All of Australia is under threat of bushfire this weekend on the back of extreme heat as the NSW RFS spokesman said there's about 53 bush and grass fires across the state, 11 of which are uncontained.

Severe warnings for bush fires have also been issued for southern Queensland, northern NSW, north parts of South Australia and parts of Western Australia. 

Images from the scene show firefighters watching plumes of black smoke bellow from the raging fire, which is burning in a south-easterly direction towards Baden Place in Blaxland. 

The Great Western Highway, which was closed between Blaxland and Springwood, is back open.

Train services have resumed on the Blue Mountains line between Penrith and Springwood.

However commuters should expect major delays on roads and trains due to bush fires.

Rural Fire Service NSW have advised: 'If you're in the area around Baden Place and Bridge Road at Blaxland, seek shelter if the fire impacts on your property. Protect yourself from the heat of the fire.'

A spokesperson for NSW Rural Fire service told Daily Mail Australia that residents should communicate with firefighters.

'We have a number of firefighters on the ground, including our air crane, and we're advising local residents to take advice from them.'

The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast severe to extreme heatwave conditions for much of south eastern Queensland, and parts of the northern New South Wales border region. 

Parts of western Sydney were predicted to get to over 40 degrees on Friday, reports the Sydney Morning Herald, prompting big crowds at beaches as they tried to soak up the sun.

Areas including Penrith and Richmond went from 29 degrees on Thursday to 39 on Friday. 

Motorists are also being advised to exercise caution with the decreased visibility in the conditions. 

There will be further updates throughout the afternoon.
