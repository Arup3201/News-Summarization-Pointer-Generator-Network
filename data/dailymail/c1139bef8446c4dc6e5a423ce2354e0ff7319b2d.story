Continuing with his plot for world domination, or at least fashion world domination, Burberry's Chief Creative Officer Christopher Bailey has launched his first collection of super-luxe automatic watches.

The Britain is a range of slick timepieces created to celebrate 156 years of the brand - harnessing all the core elements that are the essence of Burberry: history, craftsmanship, and quality.

The collection was launched with a stellar party at the new Burberry flagship at 121 Regent Street - 44,000sq ft of prime fashion real estate that has a hydraulic stage and concert-quality sound system.

And that sounds system certainly got 
tested to its limits last night, as a host of young, beautiful Brits 
gathered to pay homage to Bailey's latest baby.

Olympic gold medal winner Victoria Pendleton rubbed Burberry-clad shoulders with homegrown actors Olivia Grant and Gemma Chan, and singer Ren Harvieu, who performed at the event.

Stars of the current Mario Testino-lensed watch campaign were in attendance - actress Gabriella Wilde, who is currently shooting a remake of the horror film Carrie in Los Angeles, musician Rob Pryor and art dealer Harry Scrymgeour.

Musician Roo Panes, who composed the track for the autumn/winter campaign, again shot by Testino, was also there in his Burberry best.

'The Britain is the embodiment of our rich, British heritage and all our inspirations,' Christopher Bailey said of the timepiece collection.

'It is a very personal project that we have been working on for a long time – The Britain is this powerful balance of modernity and tradition, mixing strong attitude and innovative design with craftsmanship and timeless quality.'

Top talent: Musicians
Rob Pryor and Roo Panes have worked on many levels with the brand, both

campaign images

Showtime: The Britain launch party was held in the impressive gallery of the four-floor Burberry store at 121 Regent Street - equipped with the largest screen of its kind in a retail space

umbrellas

This is Gabriella's second time starring as the face of Burberry, after she starred in their autumn/winter campaign earlier this year

Gabriella, 23, is currently shooting a remake of the 70s horror film 
Carrie, which she has spent most of the summer filming in Los Angeles

Christopher Bailey likes to champion young British talent in his campaigns

The Britain watch collection was inspired by the heritage brand's trenchcoats - and while they have designed watches before, this is the brand's first ultra-luxe automatic range

The watches, which start from £1,275, are 'the embodiment of the brand's core values - heritage, craftsmanship and quality,' says Bailey
