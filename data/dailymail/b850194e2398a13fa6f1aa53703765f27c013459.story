Castrating a male dog is a traumatic but necessary procedure, for the animal and the owners – but a new era of neutering beckons for family hounds the world over.

New York-based Ark Sciences has developed a compound that sterilises the dog and so avoids the need to lop off the testicles.

It’s called ‘Zinc Neutering’, which involves a mixture of Zinc Gluconate,  L-Arginine (an amino acid) and purified water being injected into the dog’s scrotum.

It's a dog's life: Ark Sciences has developed a formula that sterilises a hound within 30 days

Ark Sciences claims this method causes ‘permanent sterilisation with no adverse reactions needing medical treatment nearly 99 per cent of the time’.

At the moment the Zinc Gluconate procedure is available for dogs three to 10 months old, with Ark Sciences expecting their compound to approved by the U.S Government for all dogs over three months old before the formula hits the shelves this year.

So far 300 animals have received the treatment.

The company’s website explains that the compound works by killing off sperm and permanently blocking the tubes in the testicles.

It takes 30 days for the procedure to work.

Ark Sciences admits that there have been some minor side effects in a small number of cases, such as vomiting and loss of appetite.

There have been no reports so far of any long-term ill-health.

The company said: ‘We followed 40 dogs for over two years and have data on many of these dogs for over five years. Since 1999, when the initial clinical studies were performed, there have not been any reports of long-term side effects.’

Surgical castration has a number of disadvantages, aside from the anguish for some proud owners of taking away part of their dog’s masculinity.

The procedure has been linked to the onset of cancer, hair loss and obesity.

However, it’s carried out to stop dogs overbreeding and to prevent animal shelters becoming overwhelmed.

It’s also used to subdue overly aggressive dogs.
