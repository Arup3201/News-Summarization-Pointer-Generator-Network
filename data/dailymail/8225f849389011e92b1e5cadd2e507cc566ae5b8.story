A soldier who lost a leg in a blast in Afghanistan has proudly walked down the aisle to marry his bride - who he met at the funeral of his comrade killed in the explosion.

Aron Fowler, 30, survived the explosion that claimed the life of drummer Tom Wright, 21, in 2007.

The two soldiers were part of a group from 2 Mercian regiment in a Land Rover when they were hit by an IED. Mr Fowler underwent four life-saving operations before being flown to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham.

Aron Fowler - who in a twist of tradition has taken his wife's surname - pictured left in his military attire and right recently as a newlywed 30-year-old. He lost his leg in the 2007 explosion and suffers arthritis in his right

He was in a wheelchair after losing his 
left leg when he met teaching assistant Callan Fowler, 24, a family 
friend of his comrade at the graveside.

The pair got chatting and swapped contact details. Soon afterwards, they were head over heels in love.

Mrs Fowler helped nurse him through his injuries and recovery and became mother to their 17-month-old daughter Macie-Louise.

Seven years after his life was thrown upside down, the pair have now tied the knot. And in a buck with tradition, he has decided to take on his wife’s name and is now Aron Fowler.

Mr Fowler, who has a prosthetic leg and suffers arthritis in his other, walked from the ceremony with his-bride-to-be on his arm and their daughter Macie-Louise as flower girl.

And in the evening he took to the dance floor with her for their traditional first dance as man and wife.

She said: 'The day was just wonderful. I am so, so proud of Aron. It was so lovely to see him stood waiting for me at the ceremony.

'And we danced our first dance together to John Legend’s All of Me, it was just lovely.'

The wedding wasn't without a hitch - the bridal party's car broke down so they grabbed a ride with police

Mr Wright's mother Judith Wright was also invited to the ceremony at Makeney Hall Hotel in Belper, Derbyshire.

She said: 'Callan became another member of the family. Tom knew her family through school but it wasn’t until Tom was killed that we met them.

'They have been wonderful to me and my husband.

The pair started writing to each other first before they swapped numbers, then eventually fell for one another

'They are always there, especially in the first two years. They are there whenever you need them just for a cup of tea or anything.

'And Aron and Callan make such a lovely couple. Me and Callan’s mum talk about it all the time - we’d never have met if Tom was still here.'

However, the day didn’t go without a hitch - the bridesmaids ended up being taken to the ceremony in two police cars when their limousine broke down.

Mrs Fowler said: 'All the girls, six bridesmaids, my mum and Macie, were all stood on the grass verge, in full regalia at the side of a roundabout.

'Luckily, after just five minutes a police car came by and asked if they were okay. They ended up calling in another car and getting them there in two cars.

'They put on the blues and twos for their arrival at the venue.

'They did kindly offer to give me a lift too but my dad managed to run around and get a friend to take us there in a Rolls Royce.'

She recalled: 'It was not a case of love at first sight or anything like that. Aron was in a really bad way.

'On the day of the funeral I went over to him and gave him a hug. He survived the blast that Tom didn’t.

'We swapped details and started writing to each other first before we eventually swapped phone numbers, and it went from there.'

However, Mr Fowler still struggles with his disability as he suffers with arthritis in his good leg and has been told he is facing a further amputation.
