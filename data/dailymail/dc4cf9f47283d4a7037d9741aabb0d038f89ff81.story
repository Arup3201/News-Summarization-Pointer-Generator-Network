Stanley Marsh 3, an eccentric millionaire artist best known for his "Cadillac Ranch" art display along an interstate in the Texas Panhandle, has settled lawsuits from 10 teenagers who allege he paid them for sex acts, attorneys announced Saturday.

In a statement, plaintiffs' attorney Anthony Buzbee and Marsh's attorney Kelly Utsinger said the teenagers and Marsh have resolved their differences and that no side will have further comments.

The statement was obtained by the Amarillo Globe-News.

Charged: Amarillo millionaire Stanley Marsh 3, pictured, is booked into the Potter County, Texas, Detention Center last Wednesday; he reached a settlement with the 10 boys in the lawsuit

Marsh 3 suffered a massive stroke in 
2011 and his wife, Gwendolyn Marsh, was later appointed as his guardian.
Marsh 3, his wife, his son, Stanley Marsh IV and associate David Weir 
settled the 10 civil suits.

Marsh 3 uses the Arabic numeral '3' in his legal name; his son uses the more traditional Roman numeral.

Marsh 3 also faces six counts of 
sexual assault and five counts of sexual performance of a child. The 
charges accuse the 75-year-old millionaire and artist of molesting a 
15-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy in 2010.

The millionaire surrendered to 
authorities in November and is free on $300,000 bond. If convicted, 
Marsh 3 faces up to 20 years in prison per count and fines of up to 
$10,000. His lawyers have denied the allegations.

The civil suits alleged Marsh 3 gave 
the teen boys cash, alcohol, drugs and in one case, two BMWs, to perform
sex acts with him during secret encounters at his office.

In one of the
civil cases, a teen plaintiff claimed he had more than 100 sexual 
encounters with Marsh 3 in his office and Toad Hall home in Amarillo.

Special prosecutor Matt Powell did not
immediately reply to a request for comment on whether the settlement 
affects the criminal case.

When Marsh 3 was arrested last year, 
his lawyers issued a statement saying the charges were "mere allegations
by the group of accusers who have filed a barrage of civil lawsuits ...
seeking millions of dollars."

The statement said that the accusers had 
waited to come forward until after Marsh 3 suffered a massive stroke and
was legally incapacitated.

Amarillo police have said they found 
evidence during their search of Marsh 3's offices that corroborated "the
accounts of sexual exploitation of minors."

Police seized 70 envelopes 
of blue pills, signed confidentiality agreements, two Apple computers, 
couch cushion covers and a photo of a nude male, a search warrant 
inventory report said.

Investigators also found 11 copies of blank or 
unsigned "release and waiver" documents in a drawer in Marsh 3's private
office, according to the police investigation inventory.

A witness had told police that Marsh 3's office had a large bed and a bottle of Viagra, which he would give to the teenager.

In 1998, Marsh 3 pleaded no contest to
misdemeanor charges of unlawful restraint and criminal trespassing as 
part of an agreement that dismissed five felony charges that included 
kidnapping, aggravated assault with a deadly weapons and indecency with a
child. He served 10 days in jail and paid $4,000 in fines.

Marsh 3 is probably best known for 
planting 10 brightly painted Cadillacs nose down along Interstate 40 in 
the Panhandle in the 1970s.

The cars, ranging from a 1948 club coupe to a
1963 sedan and gathered from junkyards, private collectors and used car
lots, have since become a pop art landmark.

Memorable: Mr Marsh put Amarillo on the map with the famous Cadilac Ranch he created in the 1970s

Visitors through the years have 
splattered them with graffiti and in 2005 they were coated in pink to 
honor breast cancer victims, survivors and their families. Mr Marsh also
has painted them black and yellow to honor the passing of longtime 
friends.

The installation put Amarillo on the 
map in the 1970s and the bizarre attraction inspired a Bruce Springsteen
song a decade later which only boosted its popularity.

An Amarillo native and 
philanthropist, Mr Marsh and his wife have donated to local art and 
education causes. After he suffered the massive stroke and a series of 
smaller ones, his wife was appointed his guardian.
