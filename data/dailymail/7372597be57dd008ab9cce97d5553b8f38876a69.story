A volunteer middle school basketball coach has been charged with having inappropriate sexual contact with one of her 14-year-old players during a team sleepover, authorities said.

Shakyla Wilson, 22, of Naperville, Illinois, was charged with one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, according to DuPage County prosecutors.

The abuse reportedly happened on February 20 at a player's residence after Wilson accompanied some of the girls from the Hill Middle School basketball team to a movie and spent the night at the sleepover, authorities said.

Wilson, also known as Kiki, began volunteering with the team in an unpaid, unofficial capacity at the end of January, Indian Prairie School District Superintendent Karen Sullivan said in a statement on the district's website. 

The district immediately notified police when officials became aware of allegations and told Wilson she could not be on school property, Sullivan said. 

She added: 'We want to stress that the district takes these charges very seriously. As this is now a matter for law enforcement officials to handle, we encourage anyone who may have pertinent information regarding this investigation to contact the Naperville Police Department. 

'We are providing support in the school for any student who may need to discuss this issue. If your student wishes to talk with someone at school, please direct him or her to speak with their social worker or guidance counselor.'

Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall told the Chicago Tribune that he was 'deeply disturbed' by the recent events.

'Ms Wilson purposely put herself in a position of influence and trust in order to prey on the innocence of young girls,' he said. 

State's Attorney Robert Berlin said that the allegations against Wilson are appalling.

'A coach's role is to motivate and inspire athletes to be the best they can be, both on the court and off it,' he told the Tribune. 'Coaches are there to help athletes attain their goals, not to take advantage of the trust their position holds just to satisfy their own sickening desires.'

Wilson was an unpaid, unofficial volunteer girls basketball coach at Hill Middle School in Naperville, Illinois. She played basketball with the same team when she was in middle school

Though the district does not fingerprint volunteers at elementary or middle school levels, it does background checks through the Raptor system, which is used by 12,000 schools across the United States, according to the Tribune.  

The program screens a person's driver's license information to find registered sex offenders, Janet Buglio, director of communication services in the district said. 

'Everyone entering our schools, including parents and volunteers, surrender their driver's license every time they enter a school to be used for a screening using the Raptor system,' she said.  

Wilson played basketball on two high schools state championship teams before joining the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee team for a year. She then transferred to St Joseph's College where she played basketball for two years.

Before entering high school, she played basketball at Hill Middle School, the same place she was volunteering in January and February. 

Bail was set Friday at $100,000 and Wilson is due in court on March 24.
