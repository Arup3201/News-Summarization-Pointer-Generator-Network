In-form Luciano Vietto hit two second-half goals as 10-men Villarreal cruised to a 3-0 home victory over Deportivo La Coruna to go fifth in La Liga on Sunday.

The 21-year-old has now scored 12 goals since moving to Spain in just 23 appearances.

Former Barcelona youth product Jonathan Dos Santos put Villarreal ahead with his first La Liga goal, knocking in a rebound after 10 minutes after a shot by Denis Cheryshev was saved by keeper Fabricio Ramirez.

Villarreal came into the game on the back of a six match winning streak in all competitions and dominated from the start. 

Fabricio kept Deportivo in the contest with some smart saves but Vietto finished off their resistance.

The Argentine forward slotted home a Victor Ruiz pass after 68 minutes and then five minutes later was again on target from a Cheryshev assist.

Champions Atletico Madrid face Athletic Bilbao on and can get back on track after losing to Villarreal last weekend in a match that left them seven points off Real Madrid at the top of the table.

Second-placed Barcelona's 5-0 win over Cordoba on Saturday left them a point behind Real, who have played a game less due to playing in the Club World Cup where they won the final against San Lorenzo on the same day.
