The self-styled Ginger Wizard became an overnight hit with the ladies when he long-jumped his way to a gold medal in the Olympic Games this summer.

And now, Greg Rutherford fans nationwide have the chance to see their favourite Olympian boy in the buff.

That's right folks! Groupon UK is offering fifteen lucky bidders the chance to attend a life drawing class with the London 2012 gold medallist.

15 lucky fans got up close and personal with Greg at the life drawing class

Greg has teamed up with Groupon and the Male Cancer Awareness Charity to raise awareness and money for testicular cancer by posing in all his glory for his fans.

On Saturday 8 December, the 15 lucky guests will be greeted with a champagne reception and introduced to the art of life drawing with expert Tony Picanco of the Life Drawing Society UK. 

Greg will strip off and pose for pictures and sign drawings done by the lucky few who get the chance to see the athlete in the buff.

Donations are unlimited and start from just £2 with all proceeds going to the Male Cancer Awareness Charity- and the charity has received 288 entries so far.

Greg Rutherford said: 'I’m really pleased to be involved with such a great campaign, a friend of mine suffered from testicular cancer so it’s a cause I’m passionate about.

Over 2,000 men are diagnosed with 
testicular cancer each year but what most men don’t realise is that 
treatment is very effective, with nearly all men cured

'I really believe that all men should be aware of the symptoms as it is often curable when treated early.'

The Male Cancer Awareness Charity is dedicated to raising awareness of the often curable symptoms of male cancer and Patrick Cox, founder and CEO, said: 'We are known for being one of the UK’s most bold, daring and innovative charities.

'We are delighted to have Groupon support our campaigns and help us raise more awareness for testicular cancer.'

Roy Blanga, Managing Director, Groupon 
UK added: 'We strive to provide the best experiences to our customers 
and this is definitely one of most unique deals yet.

'We have 100% support for the charity,
 and we’re pleased we can use our service to raise awareness and money 
for such an important cause.'

Entries
 and donations will be accepted until closing on 23:59 Saturday, 1st 
December. The 15 participants will selected at random and notified on 
Monday 3rd December. Enter here.

The Male Cancer Awareness Charity is one that Greg wholeheartedly supports
