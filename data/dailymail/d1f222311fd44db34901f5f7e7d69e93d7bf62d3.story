The Blue Angels got their wings back - after being grounded for much of the last year due to forced spending cuts, the U.S. Navy's premier flying squad are returning to the sky.

The U.S. Navy Flight Demonstrative Squadron - the official name of the elite fleet of blue and gold airplanes - will start its 2014 airshow season with a performance at the Naval Air Facility in El Centro, California, on March 15.

The last time the Blue Angels took to the sky for an airshow was April of last year.

The squad is scheduled to do 68 performances between Saturday and November 8, in 35 locations across the U.S., according to CNN.

In April of 2013, the U.S. Air Force grounded about a third of its active-duty force of combat planes and the U.S. Navy cancelled the rest of the Blue Angels' aerobatic team's season because of automatic federal budget cuts.

To compensate for the cuts, the branch focused its budget and resources on units supporting major missions, like the war in Afghanistan, while other units stand down on a rotating basis.

The Air Force's budget for flying hours was reduced by $591 million for the rest of the 2013 fiscal year.

As news trickled out that the Navy had cancelled the remainder of Blue Angels' season, business owners and residents of the coastal enclave where the team is based expressed resignation and disappointment.

The cancellation, part of the massive
 budget sequester spending reductions that forced the military to 
slash $41 billion from its budget, saved an estimated $28 million, NBC San Diego reported.

'I just think it's sad that there are political games being played. I doubt the Blue Angels are even half of 1 percent of the entire Navy budget,' said Lloyd Proctor, co-owner of Blue Angel Hot Tubs in Pensacola. Proctor and his wife named their business after the team 10 years ago.

'They have national name recognition and they are loved by people everywhere,' Proctor said Tuesday.

Most held out hope that the grounding was temporary and that the season could somehow be salvaged.

Thousands of fans flock to Pensacola Beach each July to watch the team fly over the white sand and turquoise surf.

It is always the biggest tourism revenue weekend of the year, said W.A. Buck Lee, president of the Santa Rosa Island Authority. Lee said he had hoped that the six fighter jets would be allowed to continue practicing as a team and the Pensacola Beach show could be replaced by a routine practice over the beach.

Instead, the Navy said that the six elite pilots would maintain only minimum flight hours to remain qualified in their F/A 18 Hornets and that squadron practices would end for the remainder of the season.

The Blue Angels were formed in June 1946 to show off American naval aviation to the public and boost morale within the military.Since then, they have performed in front of 427 million amazed spectators with their acrobatics.They have also been used as a recruitment tool for the Navy.The fighter pilots selected to serve a two-year tour with the team are among the world's best and are often graduates of the Navy's famed Top Gun air tactics school.

'The economic impact of the show for us is more than $2 million,' Lee said. 'People are going to start cancelling their hotel rooms and will hurt businesses here.'

At the time, a spokesman for the Navy said team members would be allowed to fly minimal hours to maintain flight proficiency in the F/A 18 fighter jets, but the six-jet squadron would discontinue group practices for the remainder of the season.

The Air Force says, on average, aircrews 'lose currency' to fly combat commissions within 90 to 120 days of not flying and that it generally takes 60 to 90 days to conduct the training needed to return aircrews to mission-ready status.

Returning grounded units to mission ready status will require additional funds beyond Air Combat Command's normal budget, according to Air Force Officials.

'Even a six-month stand down of units will have significant long-term, multi-year impacts on our operational readiness,' Air Combat Command spokesman Maj. Brandon Lingle said in an email to The Associated Press.

For affected units, the Air Force opted to shift its focus to ground training.

That includes the use of flight simulators and academic training to maintain basic skills and aircraft knowledge, Lingle said at the time.

Grounded: Budget cuts have forced the U.S. Navy to cancel the rest of the Blue Angels performances for the rest of 2013

A spokesman for the Navy said team members would be allowed to fly minimal hours to maintain flight proficiency in the F/A 18 fighter jets, but the six-jet squadron would discontinue group practices for the remainder of the season.

The Air Force puts on a similar air show with the Thunderbirds, elite pilots demonstrating in F-16s.

They were also forced to cancel their 20 shows scheduled for the rest of the year.

'The Blue Angels are the Rolling Stones of the Air Show World and losing them, whether it’s a few days, a few months, or a few years, it is a crushing blow, not only to the industry, but for thousands of fans,' John Cudahy, president of the International Council of Air Shows, told FoxNews.com.

'The Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds are huge draws for our industry and when they don’t participate in an air show it not only hurts attendance -- it makes it less than it was,' he added.

Organizers for Seafair, a yearly summer festival in Seattle, Wash., shared the sentiment with a release on their website the day it was learned the Blue Angels would be canceling their season.

'Today we were officially informed by the U.S. Navy Blue Angels that their season has been cancelled, including the Seafair performance, due to federal budget cuts resulting from sequestration,' reads the statement.

'The Blue Angels have flown at Seafair for over 40 years and are an important part of our history. The team will be deeply missed by Seattleites…'
