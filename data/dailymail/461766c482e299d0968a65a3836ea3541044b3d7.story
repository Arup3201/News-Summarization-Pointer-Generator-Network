Luis Suarez has little to smile about following his four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini but fans were queuing up to have a laugh at his expense.

A poster featuring the Uruguay striker baring his teeth became a major attraction on Copacabana Beach in Rio as it provided the perfect backdrop for a photo opportunity.

FIFA announced on Thursday that Suarez was suspended from all football-related activity until the end of October and he would miss Uruguay's next nine internationals. The news was relayed to commuters over the travel message boards on London Underground.

Within
 moments of the Uruguay striker appearing to sink his teeth into 
Chiellini's shoulder fans were scanning the net for photos and video 
clips of the incident.

And quick-thinking internet wizzes were putting together their best efforts to create viral jokes soon after.

An Argentinian twitter user was subjected to abuse on the social media site as fans confused him for Luis Suarez.

Diego
 Suarez, whose twitter handle is @Suarez, received so many vile tweets 
that he said he was considering closing his account down.

'Please
 stop I am not Uruguayan, I am not Luis Suarez' the unfortunate 
Argentinian tweeted. 'I am not Luis Suarez, there are many Suarez in the
 world'.

Chiellini was subject to a shocking attack by Liverpool forward Suarez, who sunk 
his teeth into his opponent just before Diego Godin's matchwinner in Uruguay's 1-0 win.

It
 wasn't the first time that the Uruguayan has sunk his teeth into an 
opponent. Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic and PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal 
were previous victims in 2013 and 2010 respectively.
