A Labour MP has joked about his Twitter followers switching to his wife, after she posted a series of photos online of her cleavage.

Karen Danczuk, 31, married to Rochdale MP Simon, 47, has used her Twitter profile to increase her media exposure, and even mock Labour leader Ed Miliband,

Dozens of saucy 'selfies' on Twitter revealing her plunging cleavage led to a surge of interest in her tweets, not least by Mr Danczuk's fellow Labour MPs.

Labour councillor Karen Danczuk has taken to posting increasingly revealing images on Twitter

The cleavage-exposing photographs have become the talk of Westminster in recent days, including these pictures of the dress she wore to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings

Mr Danczuk has been an outspoken critic of Mr Miliband, urging him to shake up the team around him and connect with ordinary voters.

But his ‘gorgeous’ young wife Karen has made a bigger impression with her online images, and swipes at the Labour leader.

It includes eye-popping images of her favourite dresses and messages saying ‘there's nothing like a good #swim to make you feel human again’ with a photograph of herself in a swimming costume.

After Mr Miliband gaffed with a photo opportunity where he struggled to eat a bacon sandwich, Mrs Danczuk posted a photo with the message: ‘Hmmm shall I eat or wrestle with my #baconbutty from @DanczuksDeli ??’

As news of the interest in her photos appeared in newspapers today, Mrs Danczuk posted this sun-kissed image

The images have flowed in recent days, leading to a surge Mrs Danczuk's Twitter followers

Despite the apparent disloyalty, her Twitter feed has become a hit with Labour MPs.

Mr Danzcuk asked on the social media site: 'Why am I losing Twitter followers and my wife is gaining them?'

Mrs Danczuk responded by blitzing the site with even more shots - making it hard for Labour MPs to get any work done.  

As news of her popularity online appeared in the newspapers again today, she posted a new photo declaring: 'Perfect weather for a bike ride today #sunshine #dry #warm.'

The couple own and run Danczuk’s Deli and coffee shop in Rochdale.
