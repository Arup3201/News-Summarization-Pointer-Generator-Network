Icon: Ben C Bradlee, under whom the Washington Post rose to prominence, died Tuesday of natural causes at his home

The legendary former editor of the Washington Post who led the paper's coverage of the Watergate scandal and made the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers is dead at 93.

Ben C Bradlee, who transformed the Post into a venerated institution during his 26 years as its executive editor, passed away in his home in Washington Tuesday night after his health declined due to Alzheimer's disease.

Mr Bradlee joined the Post as managing editor in 1965 before becoming executive editor in 1968, bringing with him a vision that elevated the city paper to one of the top news outlets in the nation.

The Washington Post would earn national acclaim - including more than a dozen Pulizer Prizes - and draw the ire of government officials for several stories pursued by the paper under Mr Bradlee.

The Post broke the first news in 1972 of the Watergate scandal which would eventually take down President Nixon.

Mr Bradlee also oversaw the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers, along with the New York Times, which revealed the extent of US military involvement in Vietnam.

'Ben Bradlee was the best American newspaper editor of his time and had the greatest impact on his newspaper of any modern editor,' said Donald E Graham, who succeeded his mother Katharine as publisher of the Washington Post.

President Barack Obama, who awarded the editor with the Presidential Medal of Freedom last year, issued a statement saying: 'For Benjamin Bradlee, journalism was more than a profession – it was a public good vital to our democracy.

'A true newspaperman, he transformed the Washington Post into one of the country’s finest newspapers, and with him at the helm, a growing army of reporters published the Pentagon Papers, exposed Watergate, and told stories that needed to be told – stories that helped us understand our world and one another a little bit better.'

During Mr Bradlee's tenure, the paper became known for combining in-depth reported stories with magazine-style features, reports the Washington Post in its obituary.

The paper's distribution almost doubled during his years and it aggressively expanded national coverage by establishing bureaus across the country and sending correspondents around the world.

President Barack Obama: 'For Benjamin Bradlee, journalism was more than a profession – it was a public good vital to our democracy. A true newspaperman, he transformed the Washington Post into one of the country’s finest newspapers, and with him at the helm, a growing army of reporters published the Pentagon Papers, exposed Watergate, and told stories that needed to be told – stories that helped us understand our world and one another a little bit better.'

David Remnick, New Yorker editor: 'In my experience, he was the most alive presence, not only in journalism but in any realm. He wasn’t the most powerful intellectual, or the most radical thinker or the most self-questioning, but the most alive. And that was the most important part of why you wanted to please him and bring the story home.' 

Jill Abramson, former New York Times editor: 'Ben had total joie de journalism. It oozed from every pore. No one had more fun chasing a big story and no editor made the chase more fun.'

Star Jones, TV host: 'Sad one of last true #journalism giants passed today. #RIP'

Sally Jenkins, Washington Post columnist: 'The Washington Post hired me at 23. "You're very young," Ben Bradlee said. "But how smart will I look when you turn out well?"'

 

Before him, the Post had  been recognized for four Pulitzers, and only one of them for its reporting. 

By the time of his retirement in 1991, the paper had earned 18, winning the award for meritorious public service for its coverage of Watergate. 

He was played by Academy Award-winner Jason Robards in the movie  'All the President's Men' that depicted how he guided Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's reporting on the scandal.  

Mr Bradlee told the Academy of Achievement in 1988 he had a notion around the first or second day of the scandal of how big the story would become.

'It was strange. You had a lot of Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at two in the morning.'

'What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing?'

Mr Bradlee was one of only a handful of people in the world who knew the identity of 'Deep Throat,' an invaluable source for lead reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, at the time of Nixon's resignation.

In 2005, shortly after former FBI associate director Mark Felt came forward as the source, Mr Bradlee told PBS in an interview he knew his young reporters were right about Watergate, 'Because nobody told me they were wrong and nobody could prove they were wrong; they weren’t wrong.' 

'Ben was a true friend and genius leader in journalism. He forever altered our business. His one unbending principle was the quest for the truth and the necessity of that pursuit,' read a statement from Woodward and Bernstein. 

A decision made a year before Watergate led to a monumental decision in favor of press freedom in the US.

Ben Bradlee, with Katharine Graham, who was then publisher of the Washington Post, gave the go-ahead to publish articles using information from the Pentagon Papers.

On a court order requested by the Nixon administration, the New York Times had already been stopped from publishing the classified study of the Vietnam War leaked by Daniel Ellsberg.

The Washington Post began running and would also be ordered to cease publication of stories related to the Pentagon Papers but refused.

A 6-3 decision from the Supreme Court upheld protections for freedom of the press and allowed both papers to continue publishing.

Even his Style section had bite. Introduced in 1969, the feature section went after the powerful in all sectors, from glamour to government, and did it brazenly with narrative flair. 

It wasn't all glory for the Washington Post under Mr Bradlee. The paper endured the embarrassment of being found to have published a fabricated story about an eight-year-old heroin addict.

What made the paper's black eye worse was that Woodward, then assistant managing editor, had submitted the story for the Pulitzer Prize in 1981, and a public fallout resulted when it was returned.  

Mr Bradlee himself thought critical recognition for his paper's success was meaningless.

He wrote in his memoir, 'Bet me that when I die, there will be something in my obit about how The Washington Post "won" 18 Pulitzer prizes while Bradlee was editor.'

Instead, Mr Bradlee believed it was his reporters that were behind every great story, and pushed them to deliver.

He 'set the ground rules,' wrote Graham, who died in 2001. 'Pushing, pushing, pushing, not so subtly asking everyone to take one more step, relentlessly pursuing the story in the face of persistent accusations against us and a concerted campaign of intimidation.'  

Mr Bradlee was born in Boston in 1921. He attended Harvard, but graduated early and enlisted in the US Navy in 1942.

He was stationed out at sea for four years during World War II, and later remembered his Navy years with pride, having served in several battles in the Pacific theater.

Bradlee, pictured here in 1970 (right) with Post staffer Richard Harwood, said told Post publisher Katharine Graham he'd 'give his left one' for a shot at the newspaper's top job

He co-founded a newspaper in New Hampshire where he worked as a reporter on his return. 

From there he served briefly as the press attache to the American embassy in Paris, before working as Newsweek's Paris correspondent.

After returning from Paris, he befriended Senator John F Kennedy, who had a home near Mr Bradlee's in Washington. 

When asked by Katharine Graham, who had just taken over as publisher of the Post, about the managing editor position, Bradlee reportedly said, 'I'd give my left one for it.'

He married three times over his life and had four children. His son, Ben Bradlee Jr is a former deputy managing editor at the Boston Globe.

Last month, his wife Sally Quinn, herself a reporter at the Washington Post, told C-Span that his health had deteriorated after years of living with Alzheimer's, to the point that he was now in hospice care at their home.
