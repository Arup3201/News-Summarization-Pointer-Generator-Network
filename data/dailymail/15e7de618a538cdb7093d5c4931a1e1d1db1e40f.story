Manchester United target Arturo Vidal has posted a snap of himself alongside his Juventus team-mates on his return to first team training at the Serie A giants.

Vidal has been linked with a move away from the Juventus Stadium this summer but he appears to be content with life at the Turin-based outfit.

The 27-year-old, who posted a picture of himself with the likes of Andrea Pirlo, Martin Caeceres and Marco Storari, took to Twitter to reveal his side were 'ready' for the new season.

VIDEO Vidal must stay at Juventus - Tevez  

Chile international Vidal, who formed an outstanding midfield partnership with Paul Pogba and Pirlo last season, has openly said that he would be happy to stay at Juventus beyond the summer transfer window.

However Juventus may have no choice but to cash in on Vidal as the club are struggling financially and the club know they could raise around £35million by selling their star midfielder.

Vidal's Juventus won Serie A by a canter last season - with second-placed Roma finishing 17 points behind the eventual Italian champions.
