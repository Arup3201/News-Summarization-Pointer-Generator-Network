When a loved one needs help, perhaps during illness or long-term incapacity, stepping in to help is an instinct. Six million Britons are carers to an adult, and every day a further 6,000 take on that huge responsibility.

But where do carers find the help and advice they need when the often complex network of health and welfare services can be daunting?

To support them, the British Medical Association has released a Carer’s Manual. Here, in the first of three extracts from it, we explore the initial steps to becoming a carer...

Providing a helping hand: Six million Britons are carers to an adult, often a family member who suffers from a long-term health problem

MAKE CARING A CHOICE

If your partner or parent  needs care, your role as carer may develop gradually and unconsciously – but taking on the commitment ought to be an  active decision.

Talk it over with family members and the person’s doctor. Consider how it will affect you and others in your household. It  is important to discuss the situation with your family and make a decision together.

You must consult the person needing care, too; their approval will make your role in looking after them easier.

KNOW YOUR RIGHTS

It can be difficult to care for someone while also holding down a job, but most employees have statutory rights, including the right to request flexible working hours and unpaid leave in emergencies. Your employer may offer you a sabbatical or part-time hours.

Anyone being cared for is entitled to a needs assessment (also called a community care assessment) to analyse their abilities and make sure they are safe. To arrange this, contact social services or the person’s GP.

Helping hand: As thousands daily take on the job as a carer for an ill family member or relative, a manual has been released to help them get of the ground

MAKE HOME SAFE

Most people needing care prefer to stay in their own home and familiar surroundings. An occupational therapist can advise how to make the environment safe and adapt the home. Caring for someone from a distance is difficult but can be done – try to create an organised pattern of care that can be shared with other people.

A telecare alarm system, which uses sensors around the home that will alert a call centre if the person has a fall, can reduce worry if someone lives alone.

Only move somebody in with you when you have fully thought through how well you get on, how your privacy will change and how much it will alter your lives.

CHANGED RELATIONSHIPS

The role reversal of caring for a frail parent can be distressing for both parties. Similarly, becoming your partner’s carer will change your relationship. It is normal to feel not just sad but angry and resentful because your future may not be the one you planned.Caring for a friend or neighbour to whom you are less close can also feel awkward, especially if personal care is necessary.

The most important thing in all scenarios is to find others to help, such as family members or social services. Being uncomfortable can lead to resentment and harm the relationship. There are support groups you can join.  Try Carer’s UK (carersuk.org, 0808 808 7777), Crossroads Care (crossroadscaring.com, 0151 343 1960), and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers (carers.org,  0844 800 4361). Local councils also run support groups.

You are not alone: Finding a care assistant can relieve some of the burden from a family member and can give day-to-day practical help and advice

LOOK AFTER NO 1, TOO

With the focus on someone else’s health, it is easy to forget your own. But carers are much more likely to suffer ill health than other people, statistics show. However short of time you feel,  it is important you attend all your own medical appointments and keep track of your health. Make sure you eat properly and that you get enough sleep.

Exercise can be combined with caring – find out about mobility scooters or wheelchairs if the person you’re caring for can’t walk far. Yoga and chair or floor exercises could suit you both and be done together at home.

Make sure you don’t become socially isolated. Set up a rota of people to visit you regularly and talk about your day and situation so friends understand better. If you’re tired, tearful, easily irritated and find it hard to concentrate, it may be time to speak to your GP about referral to a counsellor.

PLAN EACH DAY

Planning your day can make you feel more in control. Prioritise tasks and delegate those you can. Being overtired is a major contributor to stress, so build in rest time for yourself. Give yourself a treat each week and do small enjoyable things daily, such as taking a long bath, listening to a favourite radio programme or seeing a friend. None of this is selfish; by tending to your own needs you will feel more positive and energetic and be able to offer better care.

FIND A HELPING HAND

A care assistant can give day-to-day practical help, such as washing and dressing, making meals and helping the person to the toilet. They can visit twice a day, all day or overnight, or even move in full-time. Find a care assistant through your local social services department, which will recommend agencies. You may be able to get funding for a care assistant from your local authority, based on the community care assessment.

You may also be entitled to financial help with your own costs, such as travel or housing, if you spend more than 35 hours a week caring for another adult who receives disability benefits.

Even if you have help, you will occasionally need a complete break from caring. That means either getting someone to take over full-time care or arranging a residential home. There is also day centre care, enabling you to have days away, and respite holidays with specialist organisations. Contact Age UK (ageuk.org.uk, 0800 169 6565) or advice line Carers Direct (0808 808 0202) to find a local service.
