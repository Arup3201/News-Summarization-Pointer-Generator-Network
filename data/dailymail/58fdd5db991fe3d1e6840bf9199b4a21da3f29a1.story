MP: George Galloway is embroiled in a fresh row for calling a Twitter user a 'window-licker'

George Galloway is being paid almost £80,000 a year by a television station linked to Syria and Iran, it emerged yesterday.

The Respect Party MP presents a 
fortnightly programme on the Lebanon-based Al Mayadeen – a rival to Al 
Jazeera. He earns £3,000 per episode.

The recently launched station has 
refused to reveal the identity of its financial backers. One industry 
figure said it was supported by Iran and a cousin of Syrian president 
Bashar Al-Assad, but the channel denied this, claiming it is ‘completely
 independent’ and funded by Arab businessmen.

The Times newspaper has reported that 
the channel’s head of news is married to a former adviser to Assad, and 
that its general manager was previously head of Al-Manar, the 
broadcaster affiliated to Hezbollah.

Mr Galloway, MP for Bradford West, 
insisted Al Mayadeen is ‘privately owned’, adding: ‘All I can say about 
[the owners] is ... they won’t be as disreputable as the owners of The 
Times.’

The anti-war politician has used his 
programme, A Free Word, to rail against the West’s support for the 
uprising in Syria. He has previously described Assad as ‘the last 
bastion of Arab dignity’.

In a separate controversy, Mr 
Galloway is facing calls for his resignation after insulting a Twitter 
user with a pejorative term for a disabled person days before the start
 of the Paralympics.

He angered users on the social networking site after using the 
derogatory term 'window-licker' on his page.

He posted the offensive comment in a spat with a fan of Glaswegian football club Rangers, as he taunted the supoprter.

The MP posted the comment on Sunday when he tweeted to @Hawfa, whose name on the site is Craig Dickson,: 'you badly need medical help son. Will decent Rangers fans please substitute this windae-licker … '

The tweet which was visible to 90,000 of his followers on the social networking site drew criticism from other users.

this time the disabled' and @Skipjack451 wrote: 'I wonder what the 
disabled members of your 
constituency will make of your use of the slur 'window licker'? You're a
 disaster.'

'I know people who've lost their job for calling disabled people window lickers ur a dam disgrace using that phrase' wrote @dukesy12.

As @Hawfa's tweets are private, it was unclear what conversation the insult stemmed from, and his response.

The
 term was voted third most offensive that could be used relating to 
disability in a poll run for the BBC's Ouch! disability talk show in 
2003.

Dan Scorer, senior campaigns and policy manager at the learning disability charity Mencap told the Guardian: 'We are appalled that George Galloway, a member of parliament, has used this unacceptable term of abuse, which is deeply offensive to disabled people. Hate crime and bullying are a daily reality for many disabled people and the use of language like this only furthers hostility and violence. We call on him to apologise immediately.'

Last week Galloway was attacked by the leader of his own party over a controversial claim that a rape allegation against WikiLeaks campaigner Julian Assange amounted to no more than bad ‘sexual etiquette’.

Respect Party leader Salma Yaqoob branded Mr Galloway’s comments as ‘deeply disappointing and wrong’ as the Bradford West MP faced growing criticism of his remarks.

The woman at the centre of the allegation, who is a WikiLeaks supporter, told police she had consensual sex with Assange in August 2010 but woke the following morning to find he was having sex with her again, without her consent and without using a condom.

Mr Galloway said this could not be rape, as the pair had had sex and were ‘already in the sex game’.

He later defended his comments, saying he did not believe the accusations against Assange would have led to rape prosecution in Britain.

He said: ‘This has all the hallmarks of a set-up. What occurred is not rape as most people understand it.’

Mr Galloway faced a barrage of criticism after rape charities reacted with fury to his comments.

The Respect candidate in the upcoming Manchester Central by-election, Kate Hudson, echoed the criticism from her leader, writing on Twitter: ‘I am with you Salma.’

Businessman Lord Sugar wrote on the social networking site: ‘Galloway entitled to speak mind, like all off us. He has no factual detail of the alleged crime committed by Assange, so should shut his trap.’

He was recently sacked as a columnist on the Scottish political magazine Holyrood.

In 2008, two BBC radio presenters were suspended after using the term 'window licker' during a football phone-in show at BBC Southern Counties.

The action was taken after Ian Hart told a
 football fan to 'go and lick a window' in a row about Brighton and Hove
 Albion manager Micky Adams.

His comment was followed by Andrew Hawes urging 'any window lickers out there' to call the show.

Mr Hart, 44, later said he apologised 'unreservedly' for his comments.

'In that split second I didn't realise the severity of what I was saying,' he said.

'I now know it was grossly inappropriate.'
