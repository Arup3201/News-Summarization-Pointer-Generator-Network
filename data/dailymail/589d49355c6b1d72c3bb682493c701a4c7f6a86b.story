A group of hockey fans in Boise, Idaho, are suing their local arena after it emerged that patrons have been duped into thinking that a $7 beer contains more brew than a $4 beer for the past five years.

The lawsuit states that CenturyLink Arena, home of the Idaho Steelheads hockey team, defrauded customers by charging $3 more for a tall, narrow cup advertised as a ‘large’ that actually holds the same amount of beer as the shorter, wider cup described as a ‘small.’

Four fans filed the suit on Tuesday in Boise's 4th District Court against Block 22 LLC, which trades as CenturyLink Arena. Brady Peck, Michele Bonds and William and Brittany Graham are seeking $10,000 in damages.

In the lawsuit, Peck says he's attended at least 30 events over the past three years at the arena, including a hockey game on March 5, and that he's purchased beer each time.

The other three plaintiffs say they have been attending sporting events at the venue for five years and that they bought at least one large $7 beer at each event.

‘While different shapes, both cup sizes hold substantially the same amount of liquid and are not large versus small in actual capacity,’ the group's attorney, Wyatt Johnson, wrote in the lawsuit.

‘Defendants knowingly sold each of their beers in a similar manner at each event held at the arena where beer was sold for at least the last five years.’

Ripped-off! A group of hockey fans in Boise, Idaho, are suing the owners of the CenturyLink Arena after it emerged that patrons have been duped into thinking that a $7 beer contains more brew than a $4 beer

The CenturyLink Arena in Boise, Idaho, has been charging $3 more for a large beer - yet the two cups hold exactly the same amount of beer

The lawsuit was filed just two days after another hockey fan posted a video on YouTube of a beer purchased at CenturyLink Arena on March 8.

That video shows a patron holding a large cup of beer and pouring it into an empty small cup. In both cups, the beer reaches nearly to the brim.

Gwen Gibbs, who posted the video, told the Idaho Statesman that she was annoyed when she saw her boyfriend, Heath Forsey, pour the large beer into the smaller cup.

Angered at the fact that CenturyLink was so brazenly ripping off fans, she uploaded the video on Sunday and the public outcry was immediate - to date it has been watched more than 500,000 times.

CenturyLink officials quickly announced 
that the company would purchase new cups for the large beers that would 
hold 24 ounces instead of the previous 20 ounces for a bigger difference
 in size.

Eric Trapp, the president of the Idaho Steelheads hockey team and CenturyLink Arena, claimed they didn't realize that the cups actually held the same amount

Eric Trapp, the president of the Idaho Steelheads hockey team and CenturyLink Arena, denied that his company had been deliberately misleading fans and claimed they didn’t realize that the 16-ounce and 20-ounce cups actually held the same amount.

In a statement he said: ‘It was recently brought to our attention that the amount of beer that fits in our large (20-oz) cups also fits in our regular (16-oz) cups.

'The differentiation in the size of the two cups is too small.

‘To correct that problem, we’re purchasing new cups for the large beers that will hold 24 ounces, instead of 20, for the remainder of this season to provide better value to our fans.

The CenturyLink Arena in Boise is home to the Idaho Steelheads hockey team and also a venue for concerts and other events

'As we do every off-season, we’ll evaluate our entire concessions menu for next season over the summer.’

Gibbs – who isn’t suing and just happy that the company had acted so quickly – jokingly told the newspaper that she hoped CenturyLink would rename the 24-ounce cups the ‘Heath and Gwen size.’

‘It's amazing what can be done with one little video and the power of social media,’ she said.

CenturyLink Arena hosts concerts and other events and is also home to the Idaho Stampede, an NBA development league.
