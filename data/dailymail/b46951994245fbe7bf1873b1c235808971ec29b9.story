After Thursday night's rapid-fire ticket sale, seats for Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao's eagerly-anticipated weigh-in have sold out within minutes on Friday evening. 

Tickets for the pair's face-off on May 1, 24 hours before their mega-fight in Las Vegas, went on sale from the MGM property box offices on Friday at 3pm - as fight fans queued around the block to get their hands on one of 10,000 tickets up for grabs. 

The MGM Resorts Box Office was said to be overwhelmed with calls with boxing fan Ryan O'Hara tweeting: 'Spoke with @MGMGrand phone line was overwhelmed for #MayweatherPacquiao weigh-tickets, it crashed.. #boxing'

Friday's sale came after tickets for the May mega-bout sold out within a minute of going on sale on Ticketmaster on Thursday night. 

Just minutes after 8pm UK time (12 noon in Las Vegas), tickets for the richest bout in history began appearing on the secondary market with one ticket going for a cool $128,705 (£85,508) on StubHub.

After weeks of wrangling and accusations between Mayweather Promotions and Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum, a batch of between 500 and 1,000 tickets were made available to boxing fans for the mega-fight in May.

Fight fans were able to purchase the tickets through mgmgrand.com and ticketmaster.com - although those precious seats certainly came at a cost as prices began at $1,500 (£1,000) leading all the way up to $7,500 (£5,000) per seat. Prospective buyers were limited to four tickets per person. The mgmgrand.com website experienced issues minutes before the 8pm start time due to high traffic.

Those lucky enough to secure a seat for the mega-fight via Ticketmaster will have to collect them in person from Wednesday, April 29 from a designated collection point in Las Vegas.

Super-ringside tickets costing $10,000 (£6,600) were not released for public sale with several reports suggesting those seats would exchange hands on the 'black market' for upwards of $200,000 (£133,000).
