Michael Jamieson was backed on Tuesday to lead Team Scotland to glory as senior management set their sights on a day-one gold rush at Glasgow 2014.

Commonwealth Games Scotland chairman Michael Cavanagh fully expects the host nation to have bagged at least one gold medal by the end of Thursday's opening programme.

Home hopes are pinned on Olympic hero Jamieson and former world champion Hannah Miley - both in action at Tollcross Pool - while cycling and judo are among the other sports expected to deliver.

‘Our expectation is that, at the end of the night, Scotland will have gold on the medal board – absolutely,’ said Cavanagh.

‘But it’s sport. Michael Jamieson will do everything he can to win a gold medal, as will Hannah Miley, as will Aileen McGlynn and the other athletes going on that day. They’ll be giving it everything.

‘Form right now and home advantage points to success. Michael is a really strong prospect – but even Ross Murdoch, his own team-mate, is pushing him hard.

‘Michael is always confident, he knows what shape he’s in, he’s talking confidently. Of all the athletes in the team, if you’re looking for someone to step up when the pressure on, Michael is your man.

‘We haven’t stuck Michael up there to lead us – but he’s that kind of athlete. He is confident and he seems to thrive on this pressure. That’s the kind of athlete you want to lead from the front.

‘He’s the kind of guy who recognises the impact it can have. So, while he wants to win gold for himself, he’s well aware of what a boost he can deliver to the team.

‘Obviously we’ve got the velodrome, where some para sport athletes have a great chance – and then the one thing everyone has been talking about is the first night in the swimming pool, where two of our most experienced athletes are going in their best events.

‘I don’t think anybody should pin a gold medal on an athlete before they’ve actually won. While Michael Jamieson is a fantastic swimmer, and we know from London that he thrives on a big stage, he’s got a big job to do.’

Meanwhile, star attraction Usain Bolt yesterday insisted he is determined to leave Glasgow with a gold medal.

The world’s fastest man, who has a staggering 14 Olympic and World Championship gold medals to his name, is desperate to capture the one prize that has so far eluded him.

‘I really wanted to run at the Commonwealth Games over the years,’ he said. ‘I’m going there for my fans and I’m going there to show I’m getting back into shape - and that they can look for great things now and for the years to come.’

Bolt has promised to rock Hampden with an electrifying display of sprinting power - to prove he has left his injury troubles behind him.

The Jamaican is only running in the 4x100 relay, having missed his national trials while recovering from minor foot surgery and a hamstring problem.

He said: ‘It’s been rough but I’ve been through it a couple of times so I know what it takes to get back. So I’m just pushing on and working towards what’s necessary for this season.’
