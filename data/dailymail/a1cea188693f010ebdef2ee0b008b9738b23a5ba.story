Parents of almost half
the young children killed by a gunman at an elementary school in
Newtown, Connecticut, two years ago on Sunday have taken initial
steps toward filing lawsuits tied to one of the deadliest school
shootings in U.S. history.

For a second straight year the leafy suburb has planned no
public events to commemorate the massacre, which left 20 first
graders and six educators dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School,
an incident that inflamed the U.S. debate over gun control.

The parents of eight of the children killed in the December 14,
2012, carnage, which 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza ended by
shooting himself dead as he heard police sirens approach, have
notified Connecticut courts that they may file wrongful death
lawsuits in state or federal court.

Bad memories: Parents of almost half the young children killed in the shooting by 20-year-old Adam Lanza two years ago planned to file lawsuits, it was confirmed this week

Their initial court filings, related to legal entities
created in memory of their children, do not indicate who the
families could target in their lawsuits, according to a chief
court clerk for North Fairfield County Probate Court.

However, it was reported that the families who spoke with attorneys at law firm Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder planned to take legal action against gun manufacturer Bushmaster and the estate of the shooter's mother, according to the Hartford Courant.

Nancy Lanza's estate is worth $64,000.

While the parents could not be reached for comment, a
spokesman for Bridgeport law firm said that a lawyer at the firm had recently met with some of the
Newtown parents about potential suits.

'Attorney Josh Koskoff has met with parents about legal
action,' said Geraldo Parrilla, a legal assistant with the firm.

While Newtown grabbed the nation's attention, school
shootings remain common across the United States. Some 95
incidents, including fatal and nonfatal assaults, suicides and
unintentional shootings have taken place across 33 states since
Newtown, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a group created
by the merger of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, founded by former
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Moms Demand Action for Gun
Sense in America, a group founded after the attack.

Mother and son: It's not yet certain the target of the lawsuits, but it has been speculated that the families could name gun manufacturer Bushmaster and the estate of shooter Adam Lanza's (right) mother Nancy (left) 

Still standing: Above, Nancy Lanza's home which was recently purchased by the city of Newtown. It's speculated that the town may tear down the building, like they did to the elementary school where the shooting took place. Nancy Lanza was the first of her son's victims on December 14, when she was shot dead inside the home

'It's astounding,' said Shannon Watts, who founded the Moms
group. 'There is no other developed country that would tolerate
this kind of gun violence around school age children.'

Gun-rights advocates note that the Second Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms and suggested
after the attack that armed guards in schools could avert future
violence.

Newtown, located some 78 miles northeast of
New York City, has razed the school that was site of the attack
and recently acquired the home where Lanza lived with his
mother, who he shot dead as the first act of his rampage. That
building may also be torn down.

Newtown plans no public ceremonies to mark Sunday's
anniversary of the shootings.

'The second anniversary, like the first one last year, will
be recognized in personal reflection and remembrance,' said 
Newtown's highest elected official, First Selectman Patricia
Llodra, and Superintendent of Schools Joseph Erardi, in a
statement ... 'There are no formal or official ceremonies to be
held by the town or school district.'

But a 12-member commission that includes four parents of
young victims of the attack is steadily moving ahead to create a
permanent memorial to honor the dead.

'We are meeting monthly, but have taken December off out of
respect for the families who lost their loves ones on that
tragic day,' said Kyle Lyddy, chairman of the Sandy Hook
Permanent Memorial Commission that is entering its final phase
of recommending either a single or multiple memorials.

Lyddy said the panel is considering such proposals as an
outdoor park and gardens, and indoor murals and art exhibits. He
said the commission has not set a deadline because 'Our main
goal is to get this right.'
