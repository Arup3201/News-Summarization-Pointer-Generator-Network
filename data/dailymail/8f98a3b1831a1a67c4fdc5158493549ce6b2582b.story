Jobseekers from the European Union are to be barred from having their wages topped up by the state, Iain Duncan Smith has revealed.

The Work and Pensions Secretary told MPs people who come to the UK will not be able to claim universal credit, which is replacing all of the main out-of-work benefits and tax credits.

Mr Duncan Smith’s intervention fuelled speculation that a bar on access to the new credit will be a centrepiece of a keenly-anticipated speech by David Cameron on how the Conservatives plan to reduce Britain’s lure as a destination for EU migrants.

Iain Duncan Smith is planning a new universal credit to replace all out-of-work benefits and tax credits

The UK was branded a ‘honeypot nation’ this week as a new analysis revealed the extent to which taxpayers are subsidising low-paid migrant workers.

The Government has announced a series of measures to crack down on those who come here to claim out-of-work benefits, with a six-month waiting period being introduced within the next few months.

But critics argue the bigger issue is the generous top-ups to low paid jobs that are offered by Labour’s complex system of tax credits.

Research by the Open Europe think-tank suggested a foreign worker with two children earning the minimum wage sees a basic income of less than £200 a week propped up with an additional £330 in tax credits and other benefits.

New jobseekers arriving from the EU will be prohibited from applying for the new benefit, it is believed 

Yesterday, in the Commons, Mr Duncan Smith said universal credit was a ‘different kind’ of benefit and suggested it would not be offered to those who come to the UK.

The Department for Work and Pensions is understood to have drawn up plans for Downing Street to use the universal credit system to reduce the attractiveness of the UK to migrants from the EU.

Ministers are expected to argue that restricting access to the benefit will not breach EU rules on the free movement of workers, since it is not primarily designed to facilitate access to the labour market.

‘Universal credit is not primarily a job-seeking benefit,’ said one source. ‘It’ s an anti-poverty, anti-welfare dependency benefit. It is social security.

‘National governments in the EU are perfectly able to control who accesses those sorts of benefits – and EU jobseekers will not be able to claim.

‘This is a payment for people who are both in work and out of work, and it’s there to support them and push them along a path that will free them from dependency on the state.

‘It is the end of tax credits, which are hugely expensive and allow bosses to pay wages that workers can’t exist on. It’s a subsidy from the Government for low pay.’

Mr Cameron has promised new measures to bring immigration under control in his proposed renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with Brussels, and is expected to set out detailed measures in a speech that could come as early as later this week.

Universal credit combines income-based jobseeker’s allowance, employment and support allowance, income support, child tax credit, working tax credit and housing benefit in an attempt to simplify the Byzantine welfare system.

Crucially, it means it is always worth people’s while to take a job or more hours if they already have one.

The Government says that more than 30,000 people have now moved onto universal credit, which is available in more than 60 jobcentres. By Christmas, the scheme will have been extended to nearly 100 jobcentres, predominantly in the North West.

Mr Duncan Smith admitted the original 2017 deadline for all claimants to be transferred to the new benefit had been ‘artificial’, and said he made ‘no apologies’ for slowing down its introduction to avoid the sorts of errors that plagued the tax credits system.

It is expected to take until 2019 to put all claimants on to the system, though it will apply to all new claimants – including migrants – far sooner.

Mr Duncan Smith told MPs the credit would bring £35bn in economic benefits to the UK , and is now being extended to parents for the first time.

Today, a report from the National Audit Office cautions that billions of pounds are at risk if the Government fails to stick to its ‘challenging’ timetable for introducing new IT systems to run the universal credit system.

Ministers have failed to put contingency plans in place to cope with any setbacks in the digital service being created to deliver payments, it said.

The programme is already six months behind schedule and a further six month delay could mean a £2.3 billion loss in the societal benefits expected from people being moved into work and off benefits, it warned.

Labour’s Rachel Reeves said universal credit was being introduced at a ‘glacial pace’. The party has said it will review the system if it wins power next May.

Miss Reeves will claim today that the Government is set to spend more than £5 billion more on tax credits than it expected over the five years of this Parliament.

Labour will blame the overspend - revealed in figures from the House of Commons Library - on rising levels of low pay, which have left more people reliant on in-work benefits.

‘This is yet another example of Tory welfare waste: billions more of taxpayers’ money spent on in-work benefits, 900,000 people waiting for a combined 118,000 years in a huge backlog for sickness and disability benefit assessments. And the shambles of Universal Credit leading to huge delays and over £130 million of taxpayers’ money already wasted on failed IT,’ she will say.

A Conservative spokesman said: This is desperate stuff from Labour – the party which let the benefits bill double, including a 340 per cent rise in tax credit spending. What’s more, they’ve opposed every single step we’ve taken to put things right. Our welfare reforms are set to save £50 billion over the course of this Parliament.’
