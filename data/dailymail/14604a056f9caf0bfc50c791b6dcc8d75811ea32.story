A murderer who killed a toddler during a row with her mother over a parking space in China has lost an appeal against a death sentence.

Han Lei was sentenced to death in September after the incident in which he confronted the two-year-old child's 
mother in a car park in Beijing, claiming that her shopping 
trolley was in his way.

During the altercation in July, he beat the woman to the ground, snatched the child from her buggy and raised her above his head before throwing her on the floor.

Sentenced to death: Han Lei is handcuffed after a Beijing court convicted him of the murder of a two-year-old girl

She was severely injured and died in hospital several days after the incident.

This morning the Higher People's Court in Beijing upheld the sentence, rejecting the killer's appeal.

The 39-year-old had claimed to be drunk and said that he believed he was only throwing a trolley to the floor when he originally went on trial at the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court.

'At that time I didn't know
 it was a baby carriage. I thought because the woman had just been 
shopping that it was a shopping cart,' he said.

He used that argument to try and get his charge of intentional homicide reduced to involuntary homicide which only carries a sentence of between three and seven years instead of a mandatory life sentence.

Chinese media had reported after the original verdict that Han, who had been released from prison less than a year before, was so wracked by guilt that he had actually asked to be executed.

He had been in jail for stealing a car, an offence for which he was given a life sentence in 1996. However, the term was later commuted and he was released. Â 

A second man, Li Ming, who drove Han away
 from the scene, was sentenced to five years in prison for hiding the 
suspect at the original trial.
