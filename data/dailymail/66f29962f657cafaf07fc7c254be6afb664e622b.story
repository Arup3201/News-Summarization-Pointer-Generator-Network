This is the adorable moment a baby elephant attempts to take on a bus load of tourists with its most ferocious charge - before thinking better of it and running back to its mum.

The 12-month-old calf was caught on camera running full-on at the holidaymakers, who were visiting the Mfuwe Lodge in South Luangwa National Park, Zambia.

It even attempts jumping up on its back legs practising its most terrifying moves.

Getting ready: The calf stands by the herd as the tourists film from a nearby bus

But the rest of the herd carries on grazing, oblivious to its efforts.

And when the calf realises its on his own, it thinks better of the bold move - and spins round and runs back to mum as fast as it can.

Amy Alderman, from The Bushcamp Company, which runs the photographic safaris, said: 'It's pretty unusual to see a young calf behaving like this.

Feeling brave: The baby elephant then takes a run up to the bemused tourists

It rears up on to its hind legs as it attempts to scare the holidaymakers

'The babies usually stick pretty close to their mum's tummy until they're about a year old, and this little guy seems to be bold enough to be making his first moves in the world.

'He's even attempted a little jump, which is no mean feat for an elephant.

'He's a little boisterous, and probably wants to see what he can get away with, pushing the boundaries.

And ... run away! The baby elephant thinks better of its brave move and scampers back to the herd

'But when the rest of the herd completely ignore the busload of tourists, and his attempt at scaring them off, he obviously still needs his mum - because it's not long before he runs back to her!

'I love watching the elephants, especially when the herd has youngsters at this age. 

'It's absolutely adorable to watch them trying to find their feet, and learning how to use their trunks.'
