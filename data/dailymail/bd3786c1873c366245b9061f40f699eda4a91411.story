Boasting: Adam Dutton was pictured on Facebook holding a huge knife. He was sentenced to three years in a young offenders institute for a spree of burglaries

A teenager who posed for pictures brandishing a huge knife and boasted 
on Facebook about his gang's spree of burglaries has been sentenced to 
three years in a young offender institute.

Brazen Adam Dutton even joked about how fast he was when he managed to run from police on an occasion when two of his accomplices were caught.

Kitty Taylor, prosecuting at Leeds Crown Court, said Dutton also provided the police with further incriminating evidence having taken photos on his phone of some of the stolen items.

Officers from North West Leeds Division’s Proactive Crime Team targeted the group after a spate of burglaries in their home area around Bramley, Leeds, West Yorkshire, back in March.

As part of the investigation, police examined Facebook pages belonging to Dutton and his accomplices.

Dutton was shown having conversations about 'naughty graft', which in criminal circles means committing crime, and stealing 'lappys', which is slang for laptop computers.

During a three-week period, nine different properties were broken into including the home of a Methodist minister while he was giving a service.

Dutton, 18, was sent to a young offender institution for three years.

His accomplices Aaron Ward, 18, and Declan Blagborough, 17, were both given three years detention after admitting conspiracy to burgle houses.

A fourth youth, age 16, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was given a youth rehabilitation order for 18 months with intensive supervision and a three month curfew from 7pm to 7am.

Dutton had 22 offences taken into consideration involving more than £35,000 of property, while Ward had 35 offences taken into consideration involving £30,000 worth of property.

Blagborough admitted seven other offences.

After the sentencing, Sergeant Lee Fletcher of West Yorkshire Police said: 'Despite their young ages, these four are prolific offenders whose crimes have had a very significant impact on a lot of people’s lives.

'They demonstrated their arrogance and disregard for their victims when they openly bragged about their involvement in crime on the internet.

'We are grateful to them for providing this additional evidence that supported our case against them.

'It is very pleasing to see them brought to justice and we hope it will provide some level of reassurance to their victims and the communities that have suffered as a result of their crimes.

'We also hope their downfall will act as a warning to other offenders who are on our radar and who can expect to face the same consequences when we catch them and put them before the courts.'
