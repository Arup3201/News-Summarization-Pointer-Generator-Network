The 'art of pole dancing used to be confined to gentleman's clubs and bars. More recently it has been adopted by the fitness industry as a fun way to tone up and build strength.

And now street pole dancing is the latest fitness craze set to take the UK by storm.

For street pole dancers, lamp posts, road signs and even trees are the perfect stage for this dynamic new dance trend.

Combining elements of free running and street art, the discipline sees participants showing off impressive moves on pieces of street furniture.

Tobi-Jayne Lloyd, who runs pole dancing workshops in Abergavenny, Wales said: 'Once you start street pole dancing, you can never look at a lamp post in the same way again.'

The 26-year-old first encountered the concept when she completed a pole dancing course in Bristol earlier in the year.

She said: 'All the girls were really into it. I was a bit embarrassed to start with, because I didn't want anyone to see when I fell flat on my face.

'You do get a bit of a crowd around you. I had an elderly couple watching me recently, but I think they were more intrigued than disapproving. I could see them wondering what on earth I was doing.'

The movement started in Bristol five years ago, when a group of pole dancers started to meet for regular 'jams', which involved sharing moves outside.

A spokesman for the group said: 'It took us many years to realise that mediocre street furniture has great joys to offer.

'Street pole dancing can be practiced by anyone. You can do it on your own, but it really makes more sense and is safer when people jam together, swapping moves, encouraging and inspiring each other.'

Taking her inspiration from the Bristol scene, Tobi-Jayne decided to set up a group in Abergavenny last month and already has more than 80 regular members.

She said: 'Pole dancing has really taken off in Wales over the last couple of years. People are starting to hear about how great it is fitness-wise. More and more groups are springing up in smaller communities.

'Anyone of any size, shape or age can get involved. You don't need to be strong. I am quite small, but you start to build up strength so quickly.'

The dancer, from Ewyas Harold, who is mostly self-taught, first became interested in the discipline when she got bored of going to the gym two years ago.

Keen to distance pole dancing from its bad reputation, she said: 'Pole dancing is no longer associated with sleazy strip clubs, but is now seen as a popular form of recreational and even competitive sport.'

After beating more than 100 competitors to win an international street pole dancing competition last month, Tobi-Jayne will be jetting off to America in August to the Pole Dance Academy in South Carolina.=

But Tobi-Jayne, who also works as a model, admitted some classes still encourage their pupils to work in strip clubs.

She said: 'When I first went to a class, they were pushing us towards working in bars. If you were good enough, you got a job in a bar and that's what dancers were striving towards.'She added: 'I am slim and blonde and part of me thought perhaps it was a good idea, but the more I thought about it, the more it made me angry and upset that these teachers were encouraging young and impressionable girls to work in strip clubs.Â To me, pole dancing is purely about fitness and fun.'After beating more than 100 competitors to win an international street pole dancing competition last month, Tobi-Jayne will be jetting off to America in August to the Pole Dance Academy in South Carolina.
