A driver may have been blindly following GPS navigation when he plunged off the ramp to a demolished Chicago bridge, killing his wife.

Zohra Hussain, 51, died of burns after the car she was in burst into flames following the horrific 38-foot drop Saturday morning.

The scorched vehicle was discovered on property owned by BP Amoco. The victim’s 64-year-old husband, Iftikhar Hussain, survived the fall and was able to escape the car.

Fatal crash: Zohra Hussain, 51, died of burns after the car her husband was driving plunged off a demolished bridge in Chicago and burst into flames

Death trap: Iftikhar Hussain, 64, survived the fall and escaped the Nissan Sentra just moments before it became engulfed in flames, killing his wife in the passenger seat 

Mr Hussain was taken to Methodist Hospital Northlake Hospital in stable condition.

Lake County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Patricia Van Til says the road is clearly marked with numerous barricades including orange barrels and cones, large wood signs stating 'Road Closed' with orange striped markings and concrete barriers across the road.

The deadly crash took place at around 9.30am at the Riley Road exit on southbound Cline Avenue. The ramp has been closed since 2009.

According to police, the Hussains were apparently on their way to visit relatives because they had food in the car, reported NWI Times. 

Investigators suspect the 64-year-old motorist was following GPS directions when he bypassed several barricades blocking the road and ultimately drove his 2014 Nissan Sentra off the bridge.

Defunct: The Cline Avenue bridge has been closed since 2009. Construction of a new bridge over the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal is scheduled to begin this spring

Blocked: The road is clearly marked with numerous barricades including orange barrels and cones, large wood signs stating 'Road Closed' with orange striped markings and concrete barriers across the road

Hussain then emerged from the car just moments before the sedan burst into flames. His wife remained in the passenger seat and burned to death.

The Cline Avenue bridge was erected in 1982. During construction, the span collapsed, killing 14 workers. It was closed to traffic in 2009 and was condemned by the Department of Transportation the following year.

Construction of a new bridge over the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal is scheduled to begin this spring.
