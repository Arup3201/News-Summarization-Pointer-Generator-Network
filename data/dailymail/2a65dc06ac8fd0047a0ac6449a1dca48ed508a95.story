Unemployed benefit claimants will be forced to carry out unpaid work if they refuse to turn up for two interviews or drop out of work programmes.

Under the ‘two strikes and you are out’ policy, the jobless will be told to work unpaid for up to 30 hours a week or they will be stripped of their benefits.

Sources say the results of a trial scheme are so striking that ministers are rolling it out nationwide this month in a programme hitting up to 50,000 unemployed.

People queue outside a Job Centre in Bristol. If a benefit claimant fail to turn up to two interviews they will be forced to take part in the programme to get them used to working nine to five

Job Centre staff have been given the power to force anyone claiming out-of-work benefits to take part in ‘mandatory work activity’ - unpaid posts designed to get them used to working from nine to five.

Those who appear unwilling to look for work can be referred to the scheme at any stage, even on the first day of their claim.

The placements are typically with charities or involve some kind of community service, such as helping to maintain parks, working in a local sports club or doing maintenance work for housing residents.

Those who refuse to take part, or agree but then fail to turn up, have their £67.50-a-week unemployment benefit stopped for a minimum of three months.

Pilots have found that half of those claiming unemployment benefits would prefer to lose their handouts than do a stint of unpaid work.

Figures show that 20 per cent of those ordered to take part in four-week community projects stop claiming immediately and another 30 per cent are stripped of their benefits when they fail to turn up.

Officials suspect many of those who stop claiming benefits are working in the black economy and would rather lose their welfare than give up their undeclared earnings.

Chris Grayling, Minister for Employment, will be taking the policy nationwide later this month

The scheme, which is delivered by a range of organisations from the private, voluntary and third sector, is already underway in London, the East and Yorkshire & the Humber.

In a major expansion of the scheme, it will now be rolled out throughout the country.

It will cost around £5million because officials have to arrange work placements and monitor claimants’ attendance. However, ministers believe it will produce big savings to Britain’s £100billion benefits bill in the long term.

The mandatory work activity scheme is separate to the unpaid work experience for private firms, which critics have attacked as ‘slave labour’.

About 18,000 people a year are believed to be part-taking in the 'mandatory work activity'-scheme.

Employment minister Chris Grayling, who will be unveiling the policy later this week, wants to double this figure.

Grayling said: ‘If Jobcentre Plus advisers believe a jobseeker would benefit from getting some experience of the work environment they can now refer them onto a work activity placement.

'These placements are all about getting people into a working routine if they need an additional push to get into employment.

‘This is beneficial to some jobseekers as it will allow them to develop more of a "work orientated mindset" but it also makes them a much more appealing prospect for an employer looking to fill a vacancy, and more confident when they enter the workplace.

'We are determined to break the habit of worklessness and get those who can work into jobs.’
