Beverley Knight and Killian Donnelly were quietly going over a scene from the new musical Memphis before a rehearsal.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw cast member Mark Carroll suddenly loom over them with a club, and proceed to pretend to beat them. It’s a moment of racial ugliness in Memphis, which won a Tony for best musical on Broadway four years ago, that shocks to the core.

‘The first time I did that scene, I must say I felt pretty sick inside,’ said Knight, who plays would-be singer Felicia Farr, ‘that people did that to each other, with no sense of guilt or shame.’

The show is set in segregated Tennessee and focuses on Huey Calhoun, a white DJ, played by Donnelly, who introduces the ‘devil’s music’ (rhythm and blues — or any music with a pulse) to the ‘white folks’ in the Fifties and early Sixties.

Calhoun is loosely based on the late DJ Dewey Phillips, who launched R&B on his audience with a delivery like an express train. The reason for the beating in the show is that Huey and Felicia are dating. ‘Black and white romance was illegal then,’ Donnelly said.

Knight said she had visited Memphis. ‘Segregation is over, but they still preserve the whites-only water fountain — and the blacks-only one.’ 

The singer was a sensation in the musical The Bodyguard before taking on Memphis, created by David Bryan, Joe DiPietro and director Christopher Ashley.

The original songs and energy of the cast are exciting. I had some misgivings when I saw the show in New York, but it has been worked on since then.

Donnelly and Knight make an electrifying duo. He has a special routine to protect his voice, and has been contracted to do seven out of eight performances each week. She will do six and drinks lashings of Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa, a black sweet Chinese tea, to keep her voice in tip-top condition for when previews start at the Shaftesbury Theatre on October 9.

Katie can't wait to be the Carole singer 

Oh! Carole! Actress Katie Brayben has been chosen to give voice to Carole King in the West End.

The team behind the Broadway hit Beautiful have selected Ms Brayben, currently portraying Diana, Princess of Wales in the satirical play King Charles III, to play the singer/songwriter in a musical that charts her journey from Brooklyn schoolgirl to artist behind some of some of the world’s most beloved tunes — Will You Love Me Tomorrow, for starters.

She wrote that one with first husband Gerry Goffin, along with Take Good Care Of My Baby, and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman. In between writing many of those heartfelt numbers, though, Goffin cheated on her and took large amounts of drugs.

Songs written by King, Goffin, Cynthia Weil, Barry Mann and Neil Sedaka are woven around a story that eventually makes King the heroine of an edgy drama. And there’s not a number in Beautiful that you won’t know.

Brayben has appeared in straight plays and musicals before and is a casting coup for the part. She plays the piano and cello, and writes and performs her own compositions.

Her parents are folk and blues singers Fran McGillivray and Mike Burke, so there was always music in the family, what with her sister Jo Burke being a folk singer, too.

‘I’ve never known a project where I say: “I love that song! I love that song . . . and that one!” Brayben said, as we went through the King catalogue, which encompasses hits such as You’ve Got A Friend.

‘She’s such a wonderful songwriter, and the numbers have these beautiful melodies. They speak to people,’ Brayben said.

One of Brayben’s friends told her she was a ‘natural’ for the show, and urged her to audition. At that time, the producers hadn’t decided whether to bring over Jessie Mueller, who created the role on Broadway.

But Paul Blake and Mike Bosner, two of the main producers, told me that finally, they and director Marc Bruni decided to find an actress here. ‘It’s a star-making role,’ Blake explained — a view I share.

Brayben is being allowed to leave King Charles III early to prepare for rehearsals that start in late December.

Her spare time has been spent studying King’s concerts on YouTube, listening to her recordings and reading her autobiography. King studied Brayben, too; watching videos of the actress’s auditions and giving her blessing to the casting.

Previews for Beautiful begin at the Aldwych Theatre on February 10, with an official first night on February 24.

Alan Morrissey has been cast as Goffin, and Glynis Barber will play King’s mother. Lorna Want and Gary Trainor also co-star.

The cast of the latest movie based on Jane Austen’s Pride And Prejudice spent little time researching etiquette and manners of the period. Instead, their focus was on martial arts and fight training.

In Pride And Prejudice And Zombies, the latest iteration of Austen’s classic, the Bennet sisters are under attack from the flesh-eating un-dead, who pop up at the most inconvenient times.

Actress-model Suki Waterhouse told me the cast, including Lily James as Elizabeth Bennet and Sam Riley as Mr Darcy, spent several days learning how to use a sword. ‘We have to know how to kill the zombies,’ she said. ‘You can’t just give them a little shove.’

The cast will wear period dress in the film, and much of Austen’s prose will be kept intact. ‘The zombie stuff is woven through the original text,’ Waterhouse explained.

She joins the cast on set today, with director Burr Steers overseeing the mayhem. Waterhouse, 22, already knows how to box, and her father, a black belt, let her attend the karate classes he gave at a leisure centre when she was younger. The model has made a good fist of her fledgling thespian career.

She fights on the side of the good guys in the film Insurgent, follow-up to Divergent. She also appears in Love, Rosie, which goes on release here on October 22.

‘That film gave me the proper itch to pursue acting as a career,’ she told me, noting that although she takes acting classes, ‘the best thing for me is to watch and observe’ other actors.

Suki has been stepping out with Bradley Cooper, but when I asked her if rumours the pair were engaged were true, she replied, simply: ‘No, we’re not.’
