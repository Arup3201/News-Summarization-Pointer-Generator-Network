Britons think that milk, tea bags and e-books are good value for money while cinema food, petrol and train travel are a rip-off, according to a study.

Consumers feel they only get their money's worth in four out of ten of their day-to-day purchases. 

The study into the average person's spending and the value of the £1 coin was commissioned by EE to mark the launch of the first £1 mobile phone tariff. 

Poor value? A quarter of Britons would not stop to pick up a pound coin in the street, a survey revealed

Twenty-four per cent of the 2,000 questioned said they would not stop to pick up a £1 coin in the street.

Financial expert Andrew Hagger, who worked with EE on the campaign, revealed a sharp decline in the purchasing power of the pound over the last 30 years.

He said: 'It won't come as a surprise to anybody that you now get so much less for a pound than you could 30 years ago, but it's really quite an eye opener to see the level of apathy that the British public have towards the humble pound coin.

'We've got to a stage where we simply don't expect a pound to buy us anything of real value, so it's refreshing to see an affordable pay as you go package now available to go some way to bucking this trend.'

The study also found although nine in ten said they had shopped in a High Street pound shop in the past, nearly half said that they never expect to find anything of genuine value when doing so.

A quarter of those polled believed that rising inflation has rendered the pound coin all but obsolete.

An additional study conducted by Hagger revealed that in the year of its launch a pound coin was enough to buy three dozen eggs, a pint and a quarter of beer and two and a half litres of petrol.

The good and the bad: Milk is still seen as good value but cinema food like popcorn isn't worth it, apparently

Today, however it would get you just three and a half eggs, a quarter of a pint of beer and three quarters of a litre of petrol.

And that's led many a Brit to no longer see any real value in the pound coin believing that inflation has rendered it virtually obsolete, with one in seven of us happy to see it go out of circulation completely.

Instead, common purchases like videogames, microwave meals and even the cost of a haircut are now seen as not representing value for money overall.

A spokesman for EE, said yesterday: 'It's clear that current public perception is that there's little out there for people to enjoy for a pound, which has led us to introduce our new offering.' 

The top ten items rated as good value: 1 milk; 2 paracetamol; 3 tea bags; 4 fruit; 5 bread; 6 toilet rolls; 7 coffee; 8 clothing; 9 e-books; 10 laptops.

The ten items rated as the worst value: 1 cinema food; 2 petrol; 3 train travel; 4 cinema tickets; 5 football tickets; 6 paying to use the lavatory at stations; 7 white wine in a pub; 8 gym membership; 9 car insurance; 10 satellite TV.
