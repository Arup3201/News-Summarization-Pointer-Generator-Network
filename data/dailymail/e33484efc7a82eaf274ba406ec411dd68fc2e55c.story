They were once believed to be impervious to fire, but it appears that increasing temperatures are having a shrinking effect on salamanders.

Wild salamanders in North America are getting smaller as their surroundings get warmer and drier, forcing them to burn more energy in a hotter climate.

Researchers from the University of Maryland found that salamanders in the Appalachians today were nearly a tenth smaller than their ancestors in the Fifties.

Shrinking species: This Northern gray-cheeked salamander, Plethodon montanus, is one of the Appalachian salamander species that has gotten significantly smaller in recent decades as the habitat around it warms

The changes were most marked in the Southern Appalachians and at low elevations â€“ settings where detailed weather records showed the climate has warmed and dried out most.

Scientists have predicted that some animals will get smaller in response to climate change and, the researchers sasy, this is strong confirmation of that prediction.

Senior author Karen Lips, associate professor of biology at Maryland, said: 'This is one of the largest and fastest rates of change ever recorded in any animal.

'We don't know exactly how or why it's happening, but our data show it is clearly correlated with climate change.'

And, she added, it's happening at a time when salamanders and other amphibians are in distress, with some species going extinct and others dwindling in number.

Prof Lips when on: 'We don't know if this is a genetic change or a sign that the animals are flexible enough to adjust to new conditions.

'If these animals are adjusting, it gives us hope that some species are going to be able to keep up with climate change.'

The study was prompted by the work of University of Maryland Professor Emeritus Richard Highton, who began collecting salamanders in the Appalachian Mountains in 1957.

The ancient mountain range's moist forests and long evolutionary history make it a global hot spot for a variety of salamander species.

Prof Highton collected hundreds of thousands of salamanders, now preserved in jars at the Smithsonian Institution's Museum Service Centre in Suitland, Maryland.

But his records show a mysterious decline in the region's salamander populations beginning in the Eighties. Prof Lips, an amphibian expert, saw a similar decline in the frogs she studied in Central America, and tracked it to a lethal fungal disease.

She decided to see whether disease might explain the salamander declines in the Appalachians.

Prof Lips and her students measured and took DNA samples from salamanders at 78 of Prof Highton's collecting sites in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina, between summer 2011 and spring 2012.

They found virtually no fungal disease in the museum specimens or the living animals. But when they compared size measurements of the older specimens with today's wild salamanders, the differences were striking.

Between 1957 and 2012, six salamander species got significantly smaller, while only one got slightly larger. On average, each generation was 1 per cent smaller than its parents' generation, the researchers found.

The researchers compared changes in body size to the animals' location and their sites' elevation, temperature and rainfall. They found the salamanders shrank the most at southerly sites, where temperatures rose and rainfall decreased over the 55-year study.

To find out how climate change affected the animals, Clemson University biologist Michael Sears used a computer program to create an artificial salamander, which allowed him to estimate a typical salamander's daily activity and the number of calories it burned.

Using detailed weather records for the study sites, Dr Sears was able to simulate the minute-by-minute behavior of individual salamanders, based on weather conditions at their home sites during their lifetimes.

The simulation showed the modern salamanders were just as active as their forbears had been. But to maintain that activity, they had to burn 7 to 8 per cent more energy. Cold-blooded animals' metabolisms speed up as temperatures rise, Dr Sears explained.

To get that extra energy, salamanders must make trade-offs, said Prof Lips. They may spend more time foraging for food or resting in cool ponds, and less time hunting for mates.

The smaller animals may have fewer young, and may be more easily picked off by predators.

'Right now we don't know what this means for the animals,' said Prof Lips. 'If they can start breeding smaller, at a younger age, that might be the best way to adapt to this warmer, drier world.

'Or it may be tied in with the losses of some of these species.'
