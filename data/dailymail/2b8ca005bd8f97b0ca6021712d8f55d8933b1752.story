A couple have been ordered to rip down their £200,000 luxury house annexe - because it was built 20 centimetres too wide.

Stephen and Mary Kindred transformed a decaying old barn in the garden of their home in Hurst, Berkshire, into a luxury building with offices, a gym and three guest bedrooms.

But planning bosses have told them to tear the annexe down because it is 20cm too wide and the chimney and porch were said to be 'harmful to the countryside'.

Mr Kindred, a heating engineer, said: 'This is a terrible joke that is fast becoming a nightmare and has cost us so far in the region of £200,000, not to mention thousands of pounds in extras caused by legal fees, red tape and the appeal to the Planning Inspectorate.

'We have not done anything wrong.'

Work in the front garden of their home started earlier this year after Mr Kindred bought the former pub seven years ago.

The couple reassured planning bosses they would not live in the annexe or rent it out and offered to remove the chimney and porch, but were told to appeal the order.

Mrs Kindred said: 'This is very upsetting because we thought we were doing the right thing by improving the old barn, which was in a dangerous condition. We are not overlooked by anybody, nobody has complained.

'They are quibbling over 20 centimetres. And how can a chimney and porch be harmful to the countryside?'

Wokingham Borough Council slapped an enforcement notice on the couple in July, which gave them two months to comply or face legal action.

In a hand-delivered letter, Clare Lawrence, head of the council's development management team, said the building was in an unsuitable location outside of settlement limits, in an area designated as countryside.

Cllr John Kaiser, executive member for highways and planning, said: 'This isn’t the case that the owners of Fox and Hounds cottage have built a building that’s 20cm to large as claimed – it’s a much bigger issue than that and one that we have to tackle as part of our duty as the local planning authority. Quite simply, the owners have built a house in the countryside that they don’t have permission for. 

'And this is not acceptable. I hope this sends a clear message that we will take action against people who flout planning laws. 

'I would urge anyone who suspects someone of carrying out major work without planning permission to get in touch with the council and we will investigate.' 

The couple have now appealed to the Planning Inspectorate and will not know the final decision until next year.
