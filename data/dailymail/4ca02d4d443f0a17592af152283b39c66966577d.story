Mr Maguire said: ‘I'm still a dad but cannot help my children understand, cannot help them come to terms, cannot help them lessen the pain. Mummy would have been so much better.'

He added that he felt he could ‘no longer be a dad’ to his daughters, Kerry and Emma, after the murder.

Mr Maguire described the dreams he had of living in a rural backwater with his ‘beautiful, vivacious, generous, caring’ wife. ‘Now all our dreams have gone forever,’ he said.

Daughter Kerry said the murder had robbed her of her mother, and her future children of a grandmother.

In her statement, she said: ‘Mummy was a constant. Her love was boundless and her heart was open. She was a beacon of light, guiding and protecting me through my life.’

'My life today seems to have lost meaning': Shelagh Connor, Ann Maguire's sister, speaks outside court

Mrs Maguire's other daughter Emma said: ‘Every morning, I wake up and I pray that this is all a bad dream, just a split second of hope which quickly vanishes and the horror of the reality sets in.’

Her statement added: ‘She gave us so much love, I never felt alone in life, I had my mummy.’

Mrs Maguire's sister Shelagh Connor told the court that her ‘baby sister’ was an ‘essential part of me’. In her statement, Ms Connor said she felt she had failed to protect her sister.

She said: ‘For 61 years, I looked out for her. My life today seems to have lost meaning.

‘My grief and sadness and anger overwhelm me when I think of all that Ann has been robbed of. She will never fulfil her great dreams and plans, she will not grow old with us, in the love of her family.’

Another sister, Denise Courtney, said she was overcome with an overwhelming sense of loss. Ms Courtney said the date of the murder will be etched in her memory forever.

'As a young girl Ann visited the sick and helped the elderly in her local community.

'The hundreds or maybe thousands of wonderful tributes paid to her over the months are testament to the person Ann Maguire.

'The guidance for preparing a victim impact statement advises to avoid turning the victim of the crime into a kind of saint.

'Such advice does not apply in this case.

'Ann was a 61-year-old lady, 5ft two-and-a-half inches tall and weighed eight-and-a-half stone.

'On April 28 this year she was teaching a year 11 class in preparation for their exams just as she had done many times over her 40 years teaching career.

'Out of the blue, Ann was attacked with a knife and murdered. This was a monumental act of cowardice and evil carried out in front of the class.

'The callous cruelty displayed defies comprehension.

'There was no thought for others, for anyone except for self.

'The pain, brutality, shock and horror endured by Ann at the time ...

'What a dreadful place!

'We shall never know why but if age bars the full responsibility, who owns the missing part?

'Ann was a beautiful, vivacious, caring, generous human being.

'She was unique among peers and family.

'We met and fell in love in the spring of 1972. We were a very quiet private couple, constantly dreaming of a rural backwater but the world seemed to shatter our hopes at regular intervals.

'Now all dreams have gone forever.

'I am still a dad but I cannot help my children understand; can't help them come to terms; can't help lessen the pain.

'Mummy would have been much better. I can no longer be a dad. I fail every day. I need Ann.

'Parts of our lives have been brutally taken. The centre of our lives is missing. Our very being has been diminished. Facing the world is very difficult. Facing one's self is very difficult.

'Days are diminished and difficult. Special days will be especially so: Mother's Day, Easter Day, Christmas Day, birthdays.

'We shall be left with anniversaries of sadness.

'There will be no closure. Balance will not return. No level scales. No end.

'For some there will be memories of past times or special occasions.

'For my children and me today is missing. There is an everyday part of ourselves gone. Present and future are but words.'

Remembered: A board of tributes left in memory of Mrs Maguire outside Corpus Christi Catholic College

Statement: Monsignor John Wilson, of the Diocese of Leeds, said the loss was 'still deeply felt by her family and friends and everyone at Corpus Christi Catholic College and here in the local community'

She said: ‘The day when time stood still and my whole world fell apart.’

Speaking outside the court after the sentencing, the sisters said: ‘The joy of living her life and the fulfilment of her hopes and dreams and passions have disappeared with this horrific, cruel, senseless and cowardly act.

‘No amount of punishment can ever compensate for the loss of Ann's life. No amount of punishment can compensate her family for what we have lost in this beautiful, selfless, caring, patient sister, mother, wife, auntie and nana.’

Mr Maguire, daughters Kerry and Emma, and nephews Daniel and Andrew added in a separate statement: ‘We look to the future with a fragile hope.

‘We wish that nothing of Ann's life be lost, that she will be remembered as a life's partner, a mother, a sister, a Nana Ann, an auntie and genuine teacher with her generous spirit who led by example, always putting others first, especially young people.’

Authorities pledged to support staff and students at murdered teacher Ann Maguire's school ‘for as long as is needed’ following the sentencing of her killer.

Nigel Richardson, Leeds City Council director of children's services, also stressed that the attack was ‘not in any way indicative’ of a wider problem in the area.

He said: ‘I hope the conclusion of the trial will now help everyone with the difficult process of moving on. We will continue to provide support for all the staff and pupils - as much as is needed for as long as is needed.

‘It is clear to me that Ann Maguire will never be forgotten and her lasting legacy will be felt throughout the school and far beyond, across the local community and indeed across the city of Leeds.’

Head teacher Steve Mort praised the response of his staff and pupils following the attack. ‘I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all our staff and students past and present for the way they have coped and continue to cope with the shocking and unprecedented incident,’ he said.

‘I would also like to say thank you for the amazing tributes and messages of sympathy and support that we have received from schools across Leeds, from around the country and from far further afield.’

Monsignor John Wilson, of the Diocese of Leeds, said: ‘Ann's loss is still deeply felt by her family and friends and everyone at Corpus Christi Catholic College and here in the local community.

‘Her legacy is of huge importance to us all and we take collective strength from ensuring that we carry on the passion and commitment that she demonstrated to all the children and young people she worked with over the years.’
