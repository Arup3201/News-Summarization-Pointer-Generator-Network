Brazilian zoo keepers were required to adopt a rare white lion cub after it was rejected by its mother from birth.

The two-month-old female named Clara is the first white lion to be born in captivity in Brazil.

After its mother left it to fend for itself, zoo keepers at Beto Carrero World were required to take over the reins.

As shown in the video, Clara is fed a bottle containing goat’s milk and vitamins every few hours.

And she has her own private section in which to relax in the country’s sunshine, away from the other animals.

Zoo keepers plan to reintroduce Clara to the rest of her pack when she is six-months-old.

But for now, they are enjoying interacting with the animal with a series of toys including ropes and dog bones.

Contrary to popular belief, white lions are not actually albino.

Their colour is a result of a recessive trait derived from a less-severe mutation in the same gene that causes albinism.

Unfortunately however, their lack of camouflage makes them easy prey for hunters in the wild and many white lions are held in captive in zoos and circuses.

Clara’s parents themselves were brought to the Brazilian zoo from Pretoria, South Africa in 2011.

Beto Carrero World is located in Penha, Santa Catarina, Brazil and is twinned with the biggest theme park in Latin America, which was opened in 1991.
