America's most hated mother Casey Anthony has piled on the pounds after spending her freedom doing little else but sat in front of her computer eating, it was claimed today.

The 26-year-old, who is being forced to face a judge again after being served a court order for a defamation case, was found not guilty of the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee 10 months ago, despite a string of inconsistencies in her trial defence.

Following her dramatic acquittal she went into hiding in South Florida but rarely leaves her new home in case she's spotted, choosing to sit indoors on the computer and eat instead according to a source.

She's back: Sporting short, blonde locks and glasses, Anthony is almost unrecognisable on the October YouTube diary she filmed. She has apparently piled on the pounds since she was freed 10 months ago

She is unemployed, has little money while probation reports show she recently stopped attending counseling sessions.

The source told People magazine: 'Quite honestly, she's gained a few pounds.'

However, she has apparently started speaking to her estranged mother Cindy in a bid to get their relationship back on track, although she does not speak to her father.

Anthony is also said to be 'annoyed' about having to take the stand again at the Orange County courthouse in January after her attorneys accepted the defamation subpoena.

She had been planning to leave Florida after her probation ends in August but this new court order means she will have to stay.

Gone: Toddler Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008

The source said: 'She was really ready to move on with her life. This has ruined everything.'

But despite being vilified by the public after going into hiding, Anthony has not entirely shied away from publicity.

In October she appeared in a video diary that she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes for herself', although failed to mention Caylee.

It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptized again in a bid to symbolise a new beginning.

However, this apparent new devotion to faith has not stopped her revealing a string of racy photographs of herself.

Facing judge again: Casey Anthony, pictured posing in a recent racy Facebook snap,Â  is being sued for defamation by Zenaida Gonzalez, who shares the name with a fake kidnapper made up by Anthony

Anthony is being sued by Zenaida Gonzalez, who shares the name of a fake babysitter 'Zanny the Nanny' who Anthony initially told police had kidnapped Caylee. Anthony admitted fabricating that story.

It later emerged that Anthony, whose acquittal last July has been compared to the infamous OJ Simpson case, did not know anyone by that name and the real Miss Gonzalez is not even a nanny.

Now Miss Gonzalez is suing her after claiming she lost her job and apartment due to the association with the disappearance of Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008.

After initially sticking by the claim that the kidnapper had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool.

It is this primary Inconsistency in her story that has sparked public outrage in the case and forced the defendant into hiding after her release.

Her attorneys asked that she not be forced to appear in court, saying she has received death threats since being found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter.

She was convicted of four counts of lying to police and is now on probation on an unrelated cheque fraud conviction.

But, as Anthony had not been seen in public, lawyers for Miss Gonzalez feared she might go missing and decided to track her down.

They staked out her home for several days without Anthony appearing to be served a subpoena. Eventually, the defendant's lawyers intervened and said she would attend the court hearing.

'Our investigation team had her whereabouts pinned down,' Miss Gonzalez's attorney Matt Morgan told People magazine.

'Their backs were against the wall, so her attorneys said that they would accept service on her behalf.'
