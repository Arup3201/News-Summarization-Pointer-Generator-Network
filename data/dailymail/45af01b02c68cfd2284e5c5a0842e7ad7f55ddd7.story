A man and his former partner have been found dead in far north Queensland a week after he faced court on child pornography charges.

The bodies of Wayne Henry Hutchinson, 45, and Vanessa Jane Cross, 40, were found on Saturday in isolated bushland, near the Little Mulgrave River at Goldsborough, just south of Cairns.

Police say they are still investigating but the deaths don't appear to be suspicious.

The pair was last seen on June 23, sparking a region wide search.

Hutchinson faced court on June 20 on 15 charges, including a number of offences relating to the alleged possession and distribution of child exploitation material. His Cairns home was searched and a computer and camera seized.

He was released on bail and his case was due to be mentioned again in court on August 13.

The pair used to be in a relationship but were just friends at the time of their deaths, police said.
