An avalanche triggered deliberately at a Washington state ski resort caused $2 million in damage when it went out of control.

Staff at Crystal Mountain had used explosives to shift snow that was becoming unstable, but the avalanche didn't quite go to plan.

Several tons of snow took out the chairlift and about 100 trees, as the avalanche traveled 1,000ft down the slopes on Monday afternoon.Â

Damage: A huge wall of snow packs around the chairlift on Crystal Mountain

Wipeout: A controlled avalanche went awry, causing up to $2 million damage at the resort

A ski lift tower that had been bolted to a concrete block was knocked down and part of the terminal was knocked about 20ft from its foundation.

Fortunately no one was injured in the controlled avalanche, which was set off when 25lb of explosive was detonated on the popular Throne route, on a day the resort was closed.

'Once the freight train leaves it leaves a pathway of destruction,' Paul Baugher, the ski patrol director, told the Seattle Times.

'It was
 a huge area, four or five football fields wide. Tons upon tons of snow,
 in some places 30ft deep.'

The massive wave of snow was estimated to have been a size four on the avalanche scale, where five is the most severe.

Safety: Explosives were used to trigger snow that was becoming unstable and dangerous

Snowed in: The terminal that runs the chairlift was knocked about 20ft from its foundations

Despite its size, described as being capable of destroying a railway car, several buildings or 10 acres of forest, the avalanche moved quietly.

'One thing you do hear is the timber snapping like matchsticks,' Mr Baugher said.

In a YouTube video filmed by the resort's owners, who had laid the explosives to trigger it, a cascade of snow can be seen tumbling down the mountain and snapping trees.

'Kim, it's huge,' resort owner Jim Kircher can be heard saying, as the couple watched the avalanche make its way down the mountain.

Maintenance: Owners of the Crystal Mountain resort regularly clear away unstable snow to make conditions safer

Crisp: The avalanche was triggered on the Throne run, which is popular with experienced skiers

Upgrade: The resort will have to install new chairlifts on the run after the avalanche knocked the old one over

Kim Kircher told KUOW: 'It was just a thundering, ripping sound. Then I heard the timber breaking ... and then we hear the sound of twisted metal.'

She said it was the largest avalanche she had witnessed in more than 25 years of patrolling the mountain.
