A heroin dealer has boasted of his soft life in jail with an illegal selfie shot and photos of his cell – complete with cigars, a TV and two games consoles.

Jason Crocker, 36, is thought to have uploaded the images online after taking them with a prohibited mobile phone smuggled in to prison.

One shot shows a cell door wedged shut from within with a broom handle, and others show toiletries, DVDs and family photos, plus newspaper headlines about him.

Jason Crocker, 36, was jailed for five years but has been taking the selfies in his cell showing his cushy life

The headline 'Heroin Kingpin Put Behind Bars', appears in pride of place, stuck on his cell his wall

It is a crime to use a phone in prison and those caught can face having up to two years added to their sentence.

Crocker was jailed for five years in December 2013 for supplying heroin from his Plymouth flat.

Last year he admitted having a BlackBerry mobile phone in prison and was given a further six-week sentence for using Skype and dating websites from jail.

The photos appear to show two different cells used by Crocker, one with grey tiling with a calendar dated October 2014 and one with blue tiling, suggesting he has been moved at some stage and took his phone with him.

His Facebook page, which is hidden to anyone who is not his friend on the site, also shows pictures of his fellow convicts.

Commenting on the photos online, family members laughed off Crocker’s antics. On Facebook, Kayleigh Crocker posted: ‘Go on dad hahahaha.’ But others have expressed anger at the lifestyle he seems to be enjoying. Hevaa Makemsonn wrote: ‘Basically has a bedsit rent-free. Good one, government.’

It is not known where Crocker is serving his sentence but sources said the pictures were not HMP Dartmoor, near Plymouth. Philip Davies, Tory candidate for Shipley, said it showed ‘how soft and lax’ prison has become.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘This behaviour is totally unacceptable. Anyone caught accessing social networking sites will be subject to strict disciplinary action.’ 

Creature comforts: Crocker has a bathroom area and an assortment of bread, sugar and various condements

Reveling in his 'king-pin lifestyle' the dealer has a New York City bedspread and keeps his tabacco nearby

 

Crocker has plenty of space to hang pictures of his friends and family and they too have the opportunity to keep up with his antics through the images of prison life he shared on Facebook
