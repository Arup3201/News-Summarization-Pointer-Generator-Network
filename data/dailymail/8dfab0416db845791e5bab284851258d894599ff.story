The prestigious bravery medals won by a Second Word War airman responsible for conducting the first daylight bombing raid - during Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering's Nazi Party speech - are to be sold for £50,000.

Air Commodore Ted ‘Daisy’ Sismore was the RAF’s greatest low-level navigator and his precise sense of direction made him invaluable during some of the most daring raids of the Second World War.

He became a RAF hero for a 1943 mission in which he conducted the first ever daylight raid on Berlin.

The mission was timed to disrupt the January 31 speech Luftwaffe commander in chief Hermann Goering was giving in celebration of the 10 year anniversary of Hitler's regime.

Politician and Luftwaffe commander in chief Hermann Goering's speech was disrupted and forced off the airwaves in a daring RAF raid by Air Cdre Sismore, in what was considered a decisive blow to Nazi propaganda

Air Cdre Sismore's collection of medals includes the Distinguished Service Order, Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Force Cross, Africa Star, Defence Star, and the Danish Order of the Dannebrog breast badge

The mission was deemed a success when the squadron unleashed their payload across Berlin at exactly 11am, disrupting Goering's speech and silencing the Nazi propaganda machine.

On their return from the famous raid on the Berlin rally, the squadron was played a recording of the beginning of the German broadcast before the raid forced Goering off air.

For this feat, Air Cdre Sismore became known as the man who left Goering speechless.

Air Cdre Sismore started his RAF career in 1941 as a reservist airman but the following year was given an emergency commission and joined 105 Squadron as a navigator on the new Mosquito planes.

With his talent immediately recognised he was paired with Squadron Leader Reggie Reynolds, beginning one of the most devastating partnerships of the war.

Hermann Goering was a leading member of Hitler's Nazi party and the commander in chief of the German Luftwaffe airforce.

A respected First World War fighter pilot himself, he became the second-in-command to Hitler during the early stages of the war.

While his German airforce was extremely 
successful in the early stages of the war, the Battle of Britain turned 
the tide and Goering fell out of favour with Hitler.

He was also one of the highest ranked Nazi official to be tried and convicted of crimes against humanity at the post-war Nuremberg Trials held in Germany from 1945 - 46.

He was found guilty of four charges relating to war crimes and sentenced to be hanged.

His requests to be shot like a soldier were denied, and he ultimately evaded his punishment by swallowing a cyanide capsule the night before he was due to be hanged.

Air Cdre Sismore was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his gallantry, the first of a host of medals he would collect during active service.

A few months after silencing Goering, Air Cdre Sismore and Sqn Ldr Reynolds led eight Mosquitoes in the deepest ever low-level daylight attack on Germany.

The targets were the Carl Zeiss optical factory and Schott glassworks near Leipzig but before they could get close they were hit by heavy flak.

The daring pair were hit but pressed on with the mission, later safely returning to Britain where Air Cdre Sismore was awarded the Distinguished Flying Order.

In 1944 he was awarded his second DFC in recognition of a raid on the Gestapo headquarters at Aarhus, and a third on Gestapo HQs in Copenhagen and Odense, Denmark.

His medal set also includes the Air Force Cross, the 1939-1945 Star, the Air Crew Europe Star, the Africa Star, the Defence and War medals, the General Service clasp,  the Air Efficiency Award and Danish Order of Dannebrog, Degree of Knight.

The set is expected to fetch £50,000 when it goes under the hammer at London auction house Spink.

Following the war Air Cdre Sismore remained with the RAF, qualifying as a fighter pilot.

In 1947 Air Cdre Sismore and former Dambuster pilot Mick Martin broke the London to Cape Town flying record, covering the 6,717 miles in 21 hours and 31 minutes.

On 4 January 1971 on promotion to Air Commodore, Sismore was appointed as Commandant of the Royal Observer Corps.

His final post was as the Director of the Air Defence Team, planning a new UK air defence environment system.

Air Cdre Sismore retired from the Royal Air Force on 23 June 1976 and became an advisor to telecommunications firm the Marconi Company.

He died on March 22, 2012, aged 90, in Chelmsford, Essex.

Mark Quayle, an expert in medals at Spink, said: “Daisy Sismore was awarded 11 medals and four of these were gallantry awards.

'Visually it is a spectacular group to look at but also the story behind the medals is fairly extraordinary.

'Sismore is recognised as the RAF’s best war time low level navigator. He was flying in Mosquitoes and making attacks on specific targets as low as 50ft.

'The raids executed by Air Commodore Sismore speak for themselves. They were some of the most famous raids of World War Two and are illustrative of the precision required to plan and execute them.

'Sismore was responsible not for blanket bombing but for precise targeting with pinpoint accuracy at low levels. They weren’t called "Mosquito daylight spectaculars" for nothing.

'His disruption of Goering’s national speech was a real score for the allies.'

The auction will take place on July 24.
