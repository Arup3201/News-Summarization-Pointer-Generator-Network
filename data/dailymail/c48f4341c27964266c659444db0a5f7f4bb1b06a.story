Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev knew his older brother and alleged accomplice Tamerlan Tsarnaev killed three drug dealers in 2011, prosecutors claim.

The revelation made by Dzhokar's defense team was made in a bid to access federal files with crucial information on the 2013 attack at Boston Marathon, which killed three and injured 260.

Tamerlan, who was killed three days after the bomb attack, has long been linked to the triple homicide more than a year before but the case remains unsolved.

Revelation? Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (left) knew his 'bullying' older brother Tamerlan (right) killed three drug dealers in 2011, his defense team will claim. The case has never been solved but Tamerlan, now dead, was linked to it 

Now, a witness has agreed to testify that Tamerlan was involved - and his younger brother knew about it, according to Yahoo. 

The shocking revelation, if true, will come as a blow to the Boston Police Department, who failed to catch the culprit before the devastating bombing.

It will doubtless support the defense team's portrayal of Tamerlan as a bullying older brother who pressurized Dzhokhar into committing the act.

Tamerlan was killed during a confrontation with police three days after the bombings when his brother ran over him with a car.

He was close to one of the homicide victims and his friends reported him to police as 'suspicious' after he failed to attend the memorial service.

A jury for the case was sworn in last week.

Robel Phillipos is charged with making false statements when questioned about his movements on April 18, 2013, three days after the bombing and hours after the FBI released photos of Tsarnaev and his brother as suspects.

Prosecutors say Phillipos lied about being in Tsarnaev's dorm room while two other friends removed Tsarnaev's laptop and backpack, which contained fireworks that had been emptied of their explosive powder.

U.S. prosecutors said in their opening statements that Phillipos had repeatedly lied to FBI interviewers about his actions that day. His attorney, Derege Demissie, contended that his client had no memory of his actions that day.

'There will be ample evidence, much of it is undisputed, that Robel spent he entire day of April 18 smoking marijuana, highly intoxicated, with several friends,' Demissie said. 'His memory is jumbled, confused and completely discombobulated.'

Demissie said that Phillipos used a vaporizer for two hours and also smoked in a car with the windows rolled up - a practice known as 'fish bowling' or 'hot boxing.'

Authorities also revealed that Phillipos' friend, Azamat Tazhayakov, will testify against him in court. Tazhayakov was convicted of tossing the backpack.

Assistant U.S. Attorney John Capin painted a contrasting picture, arguing that Phillipos lied after the FBI released photos of Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a request for the public's help in identifying them.

'What did these three men do when they recognized their friend as a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing investigation? They went to his dorm room,' Capin said. 

It comes just days before both sides of the case present a list of their witnesses.
