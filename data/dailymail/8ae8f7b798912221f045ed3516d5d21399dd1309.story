Perhaps it was worried about being turned away, and wanted to be at the front of the queue.

But sadly for this baby seal, who hauled itself out of the sea and flip-flopped across the road to a nightclub, it was shut when it got there.

The creature had managed to waddle across a busy road in Herne Bay, Kent, to arrive at the doorstep of the Talk of the Town club and amusement arcade at 9am today.

Let me in! The baby seal seemed eager to go clubbing - but was ushered back to sea by the RSPCA

You're not coming in: The little pup popped up in Herne Bay, Kent, and managed to waddle across a busy road

The seal popped up this morning after making its way 50ft from the sea.

Local Steve Caira tweeted a photo of the seal this morning after spotting it outside the club at 9am.

He wrote: 'Saw a seal outside Herne Bay arcades. How did it end up there?

'He looked OK and was moving. Quite a few folk about helping.'

Another local, James Craddock said the seal was helped back into the sea within an hour by RSPCA workers.

The nightclub in Kent clearly interested the curious creature - or perhaps he wanted to try his luck at the Bingo next door

He said: 'The seal was outside the club for quite a while as nobody seemed quite sure what to do.

'It's not every day you see a seal wander across a road and stand about outside a nightclub, which sadly for him was closed at the time!'

The grey seal and common seal are permanent residents in Britain and spend most of their time at sea, only usually coming ashore to breed and moult.

They sometimes bask peacefully on beaches, sandbanks or rocks.

But, being curious creatures, they sometimes swim up to boats to investigate what's going on.

Grey seals have long been a common sight on the shores of Scotland - but now scientists believe that there could be a breeding ground in the south east, as there have been pups spotted on the south coast, the Marine Conservation society said.
