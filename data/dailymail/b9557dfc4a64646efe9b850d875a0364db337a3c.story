'Amazing': A new study will give hope to thousands of people with Alzheimer's after halting brain shrinkage in the region linked to memory

Alzheimer’s could be eased by bursts of electricity to the brain, research suggests.

In a small-scale study, regular fleeting pulses of electricity stopped the brain shrinkage linked to the memory-robbing disease.

The bursts of energy also appeared to prevent key brain regions from ‘shutting down’, this week’s New Scientist reports.

The research is very preliminary, with just six patients treated, but the results have been described as ‘amazing’.

Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons, and the number is expected to double in a generation as the population ages.

Current drugs can halt the progression of the disease, but do not work for everyone and their effects wear off over time, leaving the disease free to take its cruel course.

To try to halt and even reverse the brain wasting effects, the Canadian researchers turned to a technique called deep-brain stimulation.

This involves implanting electrodes deep within the brain and programming them to give off tiny pulses of electricity 130 times a second.

While this may seem radical, it is already successfully used to ease the tremors, stiffness and walking problems of Parkinson’s Disease.

In Alzheimer’s, the hippocampus, the brains’ memory hub, shrinks.

In addition, brain scans show that the temporal lobe, the region which contains the hippocampus, and another region called the posterior cingulate, use less sugar than normal, suggesting they have slowed or shut down.

To try to combat this, the Canadian researchers inserted electrodes into the brains of six patients, each of whom had been diagnosed with the disease at least a year earlier.

During the brain surgery, the electrodes were carefully placed next to a bundle of brain cells that carry signals to and from the hippocampus.

The electrodes released 130 bursts of electricity a second and, after a year, the brain’s use of sugar had returned to normal in all six patients.

And while the brain’s memory hub shrunk in four of those taking part, it grew in the remaining two, a neuroscience conference heard last week.

Describing the result as ‘amazing’, researcher Andres Lozano said: ‘Not only did the hippocampus not shrink, it got bigger – by 5 per cent in one person and 8 per cent in the other.

Tests showed that their minds also seemed to be sharper than expected.

Dr Lozano isn’t sure how the treatment works, but it may be through the electrical current driving the birth of new brain cells.

And, in mice, deep brain stimulation triggers the production of proteins that encourage brain cells to form new connections.

Dr Lozano, of Toronto Western Hospital, is starting a bigger trial involving 50 people.

Answering criticism about the practicalities of using brain surgery to treat a common disease, he pointed out that deep brain stimulation has already been used 90,000 times in Parkinson’s patients from around the world.

He told New Scientist that Alzheimer’s is just five times more common than Parkinson’s.

And added: ‘If it can be used in Parkinson’s, it can be used in Alzheimer’s.’
