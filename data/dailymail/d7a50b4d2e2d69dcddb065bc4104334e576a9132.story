Philadelphia police have released surveillance video footage showing the group of teenage girls accused of assaulting a Temple University student with a brick.

The 19-year-old woman, who has declined to be identified, was walking with her boyfriend just off campus on Friday evening when a group of about 10 teenage girls began taunting them and then followed them for a block.

Police say one of the girls then struck the female student in the face with a brick while the other suspects tried to rob the student's boyfriend. The victim was left with dislocated teeth and a fractured jaw.

Five juveniles have been taken into police custody in Philadelphia in relation to Friday's incident. The 15-year-old who used a brick to beat a 19-year-old student is expected to be charged with aggravated assault

The incident happened on Friday evening when a group of about 10 teenage girls began taunting a Temple student and her boyfriend

'My boyfriend pushed the girl away from me that hit me in the face and then the girl’s sister came at me with a brick,' the victim told WCAU.

'I tried to get away as fast as I could. My teeth were halfway out of my mouth. I wasn’t thinking about anything besides getting to safety.' 

Police say the suspects then fled the area by boarding a local bus. Surveillance video was released on Monday and shows the suspects are a gang of teenage girls thought by police to be between the ages of 16 and 17.

The victim said she was hit twice with the brick, first in the face and then in the side of the head. ‘Her teeth were out of place,’ her 20-year-old boyfriend said. ‘It was terrible, it was terrifying.’

‘I tried to get away as fast as I could,’ she added. ‘My teeth were halfway out of my mouth. I wasn’t thinking about anything besides getting to safety.’

The girl was rushed to the hospital and underwent hours of emergency surgery to both save and align her teeth.

‘All of her teeth were pushed into the back of her mouth,’ said her father. ‘Her five top, front teeth were bent all the way back from the gum.’

She has since been released from care and is expected to recover, but has a long way to go.

‘I’ve been eating my food through a straw,’ she lamented.

Since the attack became public, another 
Temple University student has come forward and claimed that she too was 
attacked by a group of young girls in the same area at the same time.

Horror corner: The gang became violent, grabbing and punching the teen girl before twice smashing her in the head with a large brick

The 20-year-old junior, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told NBC10.com she was text messaging a friend as she walked down the street when she was punched in the face.

‘I typed [the message] and lifted my head to start walking again and as I lifted my head up, there was a girl coming at me, swinging at me, and I was able to lean back. She barely hit my chin, and then she swung again and hit my mouth area and my neck and I was able to shove her away and sprint away,’ she said.

The student said a group of seven to 10 girls took part in the unprovoked attack that left her with bruises. The girl said she was able to escape the gang’s clutches and run to her nearby house, just feet from the local police headquarters.

Then on Monday evening another Temple student was attacked by a   pair of juvenile girls who attempted to steal her purse.

Philadelphia Police and Temple Police are continuing to investigate.
