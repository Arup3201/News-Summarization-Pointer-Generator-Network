Blonde bombshell Kate Upton has been chosen to star in an Old Hollywood-style campaign for Sam Edelman shoes.

In the sultry black-and-white shoot, the 20-year-old - whose seductive Super Bowl car wash ad for Mercedes-Benz was leaked online last week - strikes a glamorous pose in figure-hugging all-black lingerie and the New York-based brand’s strappy high heels.

David Lipman, the photographer on the shoot, told Women’s Wear Daily: 'We chose Kate because she isn’t stick thin.

'She's beautiful and all-American.'

In one photo from the campaign, Miss Upton wears a tight black dress and lacy heels, posing seductively in a windowsill with a view of the Manhattan skyline. 

In another, the black bodysuit-clad model reclines on a chaise lounge gazing at her reflection in the mirror.

Another shot features her sitting on the floor amid a pile of shoes, her signature blonde locks swept to one side.

The designer's decision to collaborate with Miss Upton was apparently instigated when he spotted the former horseback riding champion wearing Edelman's equestrian-style boots.

Choosing Miss Upton to replace former 
campaign star Charlotte Kemp Muhl - a French haute couture model - 
signifies a whole new direction for the brand.

The designer explained his choice to go with a less conventional model for the brand's new campaign.

'It felt like the right time,' he said.

'It was a hell of a decision to go with an indie girl.'

The 20-year-old is considered 'indie' since she has only recently broken into the high fashion world, with covers for U.S., UK and Italian Vogue added to her resume just last year.

Her collaboration with Sam Edelman marks a milestone in her career as it is her first major fashion campaign.
