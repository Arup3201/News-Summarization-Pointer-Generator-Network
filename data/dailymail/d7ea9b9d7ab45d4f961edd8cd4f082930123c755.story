David Caquais, 43, jumped to his death from his fourth floor Manhattan office

An accountant at a New York ad firm leaped to his death because he was hallucinating that the mannequins at his Manhattan office were chasing him, it was claimed today.

David Caquais, 43, opened at window at Catch NY on the fourth floor of a building in Manhattan's Garment District and jumped out about 9pm on January 2.

The New York Post reports that Mr Caquais screamed 'They're after me! They're after me!' as he ran around his office and attempted to kick out windows.

The mannequins were in the office as part of a retail project that the company was doing.  

A worker at the hotel across the street told the newspaper he saw Mr Caquais in his office frantically trying to kick and punch out the windows of his office.

'He’s yelling all kinds of things. He goes to a fourth window, and that’s when he gets enough room to get his body through and he jumps,' the worker said. 

Mr Caquais' co-worker told police that the father-of-three from Staten Island had smoked PHP prior to his suicide and one of his bosses said he had a history of drug use, according to the Post.

Though, a longtime neighbor  said he had never heard of Mr Caquais taking drugs. 

Mr Caquais' bosses said he they had seen him acting strangely at least once between in his two years at the company.  

 His co-workers told the Post he was a 'sweet, lovable guy' and described him as 'an office favorite.'

A witness said he watched Caquais try to kicked out the windows in his office several times before he was able to open one and leap to his death from the fourth floor
