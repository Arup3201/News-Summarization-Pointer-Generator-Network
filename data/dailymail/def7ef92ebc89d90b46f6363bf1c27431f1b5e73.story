Sepp Blatter wants to give managers the ability to challenge referee’s calls during stops in play.

Speaking for the Soccerex event in Manchester, the FIFA president – who confirmed he will once again stand for re-election – says managers could, once or twice a half, question the referee’s decision. 

When a decision is challenged the manager and referee will watch the decision on an off-pitch monitor and the referee can choose whether to overturn his decision.

New ideas: Sepp Blatter hopes to trial the new system at the U20 tournament in New Zealand next year

Blatter also insisted that the 'call system' would not work like the third-umpire in cricket, as the power to overturn would remain with the referee. 

The 78-year-old also suggested he would like to trial the new system - which, he says, could only be used in games where television companies are present - in the U20 World Cup in New Zealand. 

In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail, he said: ‘The next step I will propose to the international board to try and bring this so-called ‘call’ that the coaches or team managers have the right in the half, twice or once to have a call to challenge a refereeing decision but only when the game has stopped.

‘Then there must be a monitor by the television company, then the referee and coach look at it and the referee may then change his mind as is the case in tennis for instance.

Continuity: Blatter announced he is to continue as FIFA president for the fifth term running

‘In American football, the chief referee figure does not look at the evidence. That is done by someone off the pitch as it is done in cricket. It is referred to another referee or umpire, but you are going to engage the referee.

‘He can look at it, but he made the decision that was wrong so he has to change it.

‘I hope to bring it to the attention and hopefully we can find a league, semi-professional or professional that will try to do it.

'It can only be done where there is television coverage of all the matches, or in one of FIFA’s competitions, a youth competition in FIFA to do so, an Under 20 like next year we are in New Zealand so we could test such a ‘challenge calls’.’

Ultimately the power would remain in the hands of the referee though unlike in third-umpire cricket
