A father who was declared dead after his heart stopped for 45 minutes has baffled doctors by coming back to life moments after they stopped trying to revive him.

Tony Yahle, 37, was rushed to Kettering Medical Center near his home in Dayton, Ohio after his wife Melissa, a nurse, woke up at 4am on August 4 and noticed his breathing sounded strange.

She was unable to wake him and performed CPR until the ambulance arrived. First responders found a heartbeat and he remained stable until the afternoon - when his heart stopped.

Mr Yahle, a diesel mechanic, coded for 45 minutes and after doctors failed to revive him, he was pronounced dead by cardiologist Dr Raja Nazir.

Miracle: Tony Yahle has stunned doctors after coming back to life 45 minutes after his heart stopped

Strong belief: He came back to life after his son Lawrence yelled: 'You're not going to die today!'

'We'd given him all the medicine we 
had in our code cart,' the doctor told ABCNews.com. 'At some point, you have to call it off.'

Then Mr Yahle's 17-year-old son, Lawrence, ran down the hallway to his father's body and shouted: 'Dad, you're not going to die today!'

Moments later, Dr Nazir saw that Mr Yahle's heart monitor showed tiny electrical movements once or twice a minute.

'When I looked at the electrical 
activity, I was surprised,' Dr Nazir said. 'I thought we'd better make 
another effort to revive him. We were lucky we saw and reacted to it, and that brought him back.'

Disbelief: His doctor, Dr Raja Nazir, called the case a 'miracle' and said he has seen nothing like it before

Slowly, the team noticed that Mr Yahle's heart was picking up again and he was brought back to life.

In yet another miraculous twist, doctors feared the father of two would need a heart transplant or be in a vegetative state - but he has returned home and is apparently fully recovered.

Dr Nazir added to WCPO: 'In the last twenty years, I've never seen anybody we have pronounced dead and - then for him to come back - I've never seen it. Actually, I've never heard of it.'

Mr Yahle returned home days after the incident with a defibrillator in his chest and doctors may now carry out a heart biopsy to find out what happened. But he will be returning to work on Monday.

'He doesn't have one broken rib,' his wife Melissa said. 'He's not sore. These are things that just clinically don't happen.'

Mr Yahle added on his Facebook page: 'A week ago Sunday I died for 35 to 45 min it was bad enough that the doctor pronounced me dead...

'I would just like to thank everyone who prayed for me and my family over these past 12 days. God has worked more than I can say and no one can say any different... Even the doctors that worked on me say it was god's work.'
