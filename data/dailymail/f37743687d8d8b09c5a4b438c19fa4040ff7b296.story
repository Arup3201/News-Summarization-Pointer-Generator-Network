Philip Hammond will describe the 'greatest challenge to our collective security for decades' today

Britain faces the ‘greatest challenge’ to national security in decades, the foreign secretary will warn today.

Philip Hammond will say evolving threats from a subversive Russia and the spread of Islamic extremism must be stopped before they harm the UK.

In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute, the former defence secretary will say no-one can ‘confidently and accurately’ predict the source of the next major threat the UK faces.

But intelligence agencies must be able to secretly identify, monitor and act against the range of threats in order to thwart terror plots and uncover clandestine weapons systems under development by the enemy.

In a damning assessment of the dangers facing Britain, Mr Hammond will say: ‘…the sheer number and range of cases, old and new, amounts to the greatest challenge to our collective security for decades and places unprecedented demands on those charged with keeping us safe.’

He will say the country is now faced with a Russian leader ‘bent’ on subverting the international rules-based system which keeps the peace between nations.

‘President Putin’s actions… fundamentally undermine the security of sovereign nations in Eastern Europe’, he will say.

Britain is being forced to cope with a greater range of threats, from state-sponsored aggression, to international terrorist organisations, to ‘lone wolf’ self-radicalised terrorists with the intent on damaging UK national security.

The emergence of groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria and Islamic State in Syria, Iraq and Libya serves to underline the ‘pace’ with which the threats to Britain’s safety and security are ‘evolving’, he will claim.

Mr Hammond will throw his weight behind plans for new laws to force internet companies to store email, web and social media records so they can be accessed by the security and intelligence agencies.

The former defence secretary will describe Putin's actions as having 'undermined' the security of sovereign nations 

He will say: ‘We must respond decisively and positively to the public and parliamentary debate about the powers required by our intelligence agencies to do their job in a changed technological environment – and in doing so draw a line under that debate so that the agencies can get on with the job of keeping this country safe.’

The security services warn that the law is failing to keep up with changing technology so their ability to track terrorists online is constantly diminishing.

He will add: ‘As the range of threats gets bigger, so the pace of technological change with which the Agencies must keep up is getting faster, making their central task of keeping us safe ever more demanding.’

He will also speak of 'warped' view human rights activists have taken on the case of jihadi Mohammed Emwazi 

The clandestine nature of some of the threats launched against us ‘require that we maintain a highly effective, secret capability to identify, monitor, and act against these threats before they can do us harm’, he will say.

These include ‘the weapons systems that are developed in secrecy to threaten our national security.... and the great lengths that individual terrorists or terrorist organisations go to in order to try and keep their plots from being uncovered’.

The head of the MI5, Andrew Parker, has warned that ‘if parts of the radar go dark’ and terrorists are beyond the reach of his agency, Britain would be more vulnerable to attack.

Tory plans for new laws to require firms to store data on internet communications, so they can be accessed as part of an investigation, were blocked by the Lib Dems who brand them a ‘snoopers’ charter’. But David Cameron has pledged to revive them if this Tories are re-elected.

Intelligence gathered by the UK security services has already been instrumental in helping the UK counter the threat from extremists and identifying targets for building effective sanctions against Russia, Mr Hammond will say.

He will also use the speech to criticise the ‘warped’ human rights organisation Cage, which sparked outrage after one of its research directors described Mohammed Emwazi as a ‘beautiful young’ man, and praise the ‘dedication’ and ‘brilliance’ of intelligence officers.

He is expected to say: ‘The responsibility for acts of terror rests with those who commit them.

‘But a huge burden of responsibility also lies with those who act as apologists for them.’
