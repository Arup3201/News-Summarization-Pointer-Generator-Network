A man wanted in connection with a shooting and crash which killed three people on the Las Vegas Strip has been arrested, police revealed today.

Las Vegas police Captain Chris Jones said self-described 'pimp' Ammar Harris was arrested Thursday by a team of police and federal agents in North Hollywood.

The 26-year-old was the subject of a multi-state manhunt following the February 21 shooting which caused a dramatic multiple car accident down the resort's famous road which claimed the lives of three people including a tourist, who was a mother of three.

Police say Harris fired five shots 
into a Maserati killing aspiring rapper Kenneth Cherry around 4.20am.

The pair are 
believed to have argued outside a rap concert earlier in the evening.

As Cherry, 27, tried to escape the 
spray of bullets he hit the accelerator and crashed at speed into a 
nearby taxi hitting six other vehicles.

The taxi was engulfed in flames 
killing passenger, Sandi Sutton-Wasmund from Maple Valley Washington who had twice survived breast cancer, 
and driver Michael Boldon, the sole carer for his elderly mother.

Police say Harris was driving the blacked-out SUV and fired the shots at Cherry.

Tineesha Lashun Howard, a 22-year-old 
woman also known as Yenesis Alfonzo, was previously being sought in 
connection with the incident as an identified passenger in the SUV but 
was said to no longer be a person of interest today.

Police say there were two other women, as well as Howard, in the SUV as well as a male passenger.

They have now all been found and interviewed and will not face any charges.

Jones wouldn't release the names of the other passengers saying police were concerned for their safety.

'There is no other person wanted in this case other than Harris,' Jones said. 'No one else faces charges.'

Harris is a felon and has Internet 
posts which show him with fists full of money, boasting of a 
high-rolling lifestyle with prostitutes.

He was arrested last year in Las Vegas
in a 2010 prostitution case using the name Ammar Asim Faruq Harris. He 
was charged with robbery, sexual assault, kidnapping and coercion with a
weapon, and police sought charges of pandering by force and felon in 
possession of concealed weapon. Court records show that case was 
dismissed last June.

Harris was convicted in South Carolina
in 2004 of felony possession with intent to sell a stolen pistol and 
convicted that same year in Atlanta of a misdemeanor marijuana 
possession charge.

Cherry, who performed under the name 'Kenny Clutch, was described as a 'decent kid' by devastated relatives in North California.

No weapons were found in the silver Maserati, police confirmed today, and Cherry did not return fire.

'I want to make it clear that my son was no gangster or nothing like 
that,' his father, also Kenneth, said.

'He moved to Vegas about six year 
ago and he was writing music and rap.'

In a statement the family of Sandi 
Sutton-Wasmund described her as ' loving wife, mother, 
daughter and sister' She was well-known in her small town and was in Las
Vegas for a trade show to by clothes for her womenswear shop.

Allegations: Police claim Ammar Harris was driving this blacked-out SUV and shot five times at aspiring rapper Kenneth Cherry

Bolden's family revealed he had moved to Las Vegas a year ago to care for his 93-year-old mother.

Las Vegas taxicab companies pledged 
$35,000 toward a reward fund for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of Harris in honor of the driver.

Five other people were injured in the incident.
