Gary Neville will decide in the next 18 months whether he wants to quit his job as a television pundit and go into management.

Neville has become a popular and respected pundit since he retired from football and signed with Sky four years ago.

His views have been so well-received that he has been tipped to go into management and he already has a coaching role within the England set-up.

And Neville is not ruling out moving into football management, it seems. When asked during a Twitter Q&A whether he would consider becoming a manager, the former Manchester United captain said: 'I have a decision to make in the next 18 months.'

Neville, who played 602 times for United, currently holds his UEFA A and B coaching licences.

His brother Phil was part of David Moyes' coaching staff at United, but left soon after the Scot's dismissal last April.
