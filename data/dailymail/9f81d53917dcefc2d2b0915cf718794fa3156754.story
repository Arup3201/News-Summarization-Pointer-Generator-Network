When 97-year-old Hal Lasko began to lose his eyesight ten years ago he thought he would never be able to paint again.

But, with the help of a computer and the Microsoft Paint program, the legally blind Ohio grandfather has found a way to express his creativity and make his retirement more enjoyable.

The former 'lettering man' who created typography for American Greetings, and who is due to celebrate his 98th birthday on Sunday, now creates landscapes reminiscent of Warren Kimble or Edward Hopper, which sell for $98.

Pixel painter: Artist Ron Lasko uses a computer to create his images after losing his eyesight

Mr Lasko's work in Microsoft Paint has been compared to artists Warren Kimble and Edward Hopper

Mr Lasko, who lives with his son, Ron, in Rocky River, told ABC News: 'When I lost my eyesight I thought my painting days were over.'

It was a hard prospect for the war veteran to come to terms with. He had made a career out of his creativity, from being a graphic artist to drafting weather maps when he served in the Second World War.

He suffers from wet macular degeneration, which made it impossible for him to continue with his traditional method of oils and acrylics.

In 1999 however, his family gave him a computer, in the hope that it would help him to magnify his work and see colors more easily.

His grandson, Ryan Lasko, who has made a film about his art, said: 'I knew I had to show him Microsoft Paint, and once I did he just took off with it.'

Intricate: The paintings, of landscapes and animals, are slowly created pixel by pixel

Sense of fun: After years of working as a graphic designer, the 97-year-old says he can now enjoy creating images for himself rather than a client

Creative outlet: Hal Lasko's family say they had no idea how important Microsoft Paint would become to him after they showed him how to use it

'It wasnâ€™t until years later that we realized how important this thing was to him.'

Mr Lasko told ABC News: 'I was having a problem with 
the paint brush because my eye sight was getting poorer. I went to the computer because I could magnify it. I learned
to use the Paint program just like I paint with a brush.'

From village scenes and autumnal forests to stained glass windows, the pictures Mr Lasko now creates in his home studio are both beautiful and intricate.

The process can be time consuming but Mr Lasko, who has had his work exhibited in Ohio, said: 'If it takes me two years I can spend that, I've got a lot of patience.'

Patience: It can take Hal Lasko a long time to create his pictures but he enjoys every moment

In the short film about his art, Mr Lasko added: 'It's no longer work, it's fun. When I worked I always had to do something to please the client. Now I can do whatever I want.'

As well as enabling Mr Lasko to continue with his art, his son believes it has helped occupy him after the death of his wife a few years ago.

Holding back his emotions, he said: 'I've never heard him complain about his age or ... or talk about dying at all. He doesn't have that in him.'

The pixel artist is certainly still going strong. As part of his 98th birthday celebrations this weekend, eight prints, all signed by the artist, are being sold for $98 on Hallasko.com with 10 per cent of the the money going to the Veterans of Foreign Wars program.
