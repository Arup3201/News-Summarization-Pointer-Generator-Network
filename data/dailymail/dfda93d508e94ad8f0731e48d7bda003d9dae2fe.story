An Apache combat helicopter has crashed during a night-time training mission in Idaho, killing both pilots on board.

The Defence Department will investigate the crash after the Idaho Army National Guard helicopter went down only two miles south of its training base near Boise International Airport.

It wasn't immediately clear whether the crew was heading to or returning from a mission.

Police and military officials discuss how to manage the crash site after the helicopter went down about 7pm

Colonel Tim Marsano, a National Guard spokesman, confirmed the two men had been killed in the crash but would not identify them as their relatives had yet to be notified.

He told KBOI2: 'It is a very difficult evening for us in the Idaho National Guard. We don't know the reasons why [it crashed]. We can't speculate at this point.'

It was confirmed there was no fire or explosion in the crash, which occurred about 7pm, and the two men's bodies were not burnt.

Prior to the crash, the Idaho Army National Guard had 16 Apache helicopters at its Gowen Field training base. It has a training area about 20 miles south of Gowen Field, but pilots also train over other areas.

Major General Gary Sayler, commander of the Idaho National Guard, released a statement expressing his condolences to the victims' families.

'The men and women of the Idaho National Guard are united in grief at the loss of two of our brothers in arms, who gave their lives while training to defend our nation.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with their families.'

Boise firefighters initially responded to the crash but then turned the scene over to the National Guard, Fire Chief Dennis Doan said, whileÂ Ada County sheriff's deputies secured the site and blocked media access.
