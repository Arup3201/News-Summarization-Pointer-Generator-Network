A party celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr day called 'Freedom 2 Twerk' has been cancelled after a poster promoting the event caused outrage.

A Michigan party promotor called Mid-Michigan Teen Parties photoshopped Dr Martin Luther King Jr's head onto the body of a man wearing a heavy gold medallion and throwing a gang sign.

The freedom to twerk was decidedly not one of King's civil rights dreams and the use of his image offended many in the community, especially his descendants.

Wrong message: The organizers of the Freedom to Twerk party used Dr Martin Luther King, Jr's head superimposed on another man's body

Bernice King, daughter of the late civil rights icon, called the poster 'appalling' and 'almost embarrassing' in an interview with Fox 5.

'I lost a father who sacrificed everything for them to live a much more dignified and respectful life,' she said. 'And for it to come to this just makes me sad.'

It's not the first promotional poster to appropriate Dr King's image for profit.

A flyer for a Miami strip club featuring Dr King with a wad of cash standing next to a scantily clad woman earned its creator flack in 2012.

And last year's 'MLK Chocolate Affair,' All Black Party' and 'No Worries Bash,' the latter of which featured Dr King in a pair of headphones and flanked by Lil Wayne and yet another scantily clad woman, all came in for criticism.

Misrepresentation: Party posters like this that use Dr Martin Luther King, Jr's image are 'almost embarrassing,' says King's daughter

'Appalling': Bernice King says her father sacrificed everything so that people could live with dignity and respect and hopes this is a 'teachable moment'

The owner of the venue where the Freedom to Twerk party Vic McEwan was to be held has said he was not consulted about the advertising materials.'We have since cancelled said event, refunded the promotor's deposit and informed the group thatÂ  they will no longer be welcome at our establishment,' he said in a statement to Fox 5.'As an African-American man who owns a business, I have a lot of responsibility,' McEwen said, according to the New York Daily News. 'This is about his legacy. Dr. King has done way too much for this country, or me, or anyone, to allow this to go on.'

Missing the point: Another Martin Luther King, Jr Day party, another unauthorized image of the icon

Leader: Dr Martin Luther King, Jr won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 and was assassinated four years later

McEwan has now planned his own Martin Luther King Day party that will truly honor Nobel Peace Prize winner.

The MLK Awareness Event' aims to 'bring about social awareness and youth participation as it pertains to Dr Martin Luther King Jr's legacy.'

New plan: The Social Network Banquet and Event Center has organized its own Martin Luther King, Jr Day event

On the Social Network's Facebook page, Terri Williams ,who brought the poster to the business's attention, said she was glad they cancelled the party.

'Please know that I stand proudly and supportive behind your decision and hope that profit never supersedes respect for these party promoters,' she said. 'They can twerk if they choose to, but leave the deceased civil rights Nobel Peace Prize legacy to rest respectfully in peace.'

Dr Bernice King says she doesn't believe the poster was malicious, just ignorant, and hopes the incident will prove to be a 'teachable moment.'

'We can begin the process of educating them and helping them to see how this is insulting and how this is not truly representative of Dr King.'

The civil rights leader would have turned 85 last week.
