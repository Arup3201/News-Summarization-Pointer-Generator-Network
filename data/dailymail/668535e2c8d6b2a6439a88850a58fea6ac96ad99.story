Hatem Ben Arfa has cancelled plans to meet with Newcastle United supporters on the same day the club holds an open training session at St James' Park.

The French midfielder - banished to the reserves by Alan Pardew this summer - had invited supporters for a 'meet and greet' at a book shop just around the corner from the stadium.

However, Ben Arfa has now decided against the move.

Waving goodbye? Newcastle winger Hatem Ben Arfa has cancelled his meeting with supporters at The Back Page shop as he believes it would be 'counter-productive' as he has not been included in open training

Not wanted: Ben Arfa, pictured here in training last season, could leave St James' Park this summer

Banished: Ben Arfa's professionalism has been questioned  and he has been made to train with the reserves

The Back Page - where the player had planned to meet fans - said: 'It is with great regret that we must announce that the planned appearance of Hatem Ben Arfa at The Back Page shop later today has been cancelled.

'Since accepting the invitation last week, it has become increasingly clear that Hatem will be excluded from the training day event at St James' Park today.

'In light of the increasing media circus that news has prompted, both the Back Page and Hatem agree that staging the event would be counter-productive and cancellation is the most logical course of action.

'Hatem sends his apologies and is saddened that he's unable to meet supporters at this time.'

Not happy: Manager Alan Pardew has criticised Ben Arfa's professionalism and sent him to the reserves

Newcastle begin their Premier League campaign by hosting champions Manchester City on Sunday and Pardew is hopeful defensive midfielder Cheick Tiote and new signing Siem de Joing will be fit to face Manuel Pellegrini's men. 

Pardew told Sky Sports News: 'On whether Siem and Cheick will be be available - it will be disappointing if they are not, but they are running well today.

'So they could be available and make it an easy job for me to pick my strongest team. But we'll have to see.'

On De Jong, he added: 'I think he is a terrific player.

'I have been lucky enough in my career to manage some great players and I think he could be one of the best.

'I worked with Teddy Sheringham and he reminds me a lot of Teddy in the way he conducts the game, the way he conducts himself, and that will be shown on a matchday.'
