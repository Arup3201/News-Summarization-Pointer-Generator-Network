Aberdeen legend Willie Miller has urged the board to back Derek McInnes in the January transfer window to help keep the title heat on Celtic.

The Pittodrie club confirmed that Jonny Hayes and Andrew Considine have become the latest first-team players to sign contract extensions.

Miller, though, hopes there will also be leeway to add to their current options after recently wiping out historic debt of nearly £15million.

Dons boss Derek McInnes has earned the right to strengthen his squad, says Willie Miller

The former Dons captain, manager and director is not advocating risky spending, but feels McInnes deserves a reward after guiding Aberdeen to within two points of the champions.

‘Derek McInnes has earned the right to be allowed to strengthen his squad when the transfer window re-opens later this week,’ said Miller.

‘He’s delivered all that has been asked of him at Aberdeen so far. But for three games it has been an almost perfect year for the Dons.

‘The only black marks have been those Scottish Cup defeats by St Johnstone and Dundee and that final day league defeat by Motherwell.

‘There will be no such slip-ups this time if McInnes is allowed to strengthen his squad further for the final push.

‘McInnes will rightly be keen to add to his squad and it’s clear the club are in a position where they can help him.

‘I’m not talking about putting themselves back into debt. We know that must never be allowed to happen again.

‘But the manager deserves to be fully supported as a thank you for the fantastic job he’s done since arriving at Pittodrie.’

Hayes has signed a new contract that will keep him at Aberdeen until the summer of 2018 while defender Considine – in his testimonial season – has agreed terms until 2017. The deals follow similar agreements with Niall McGinn and Adam Rooney last week.

‘Both Jonny and Andy have shown a great deal of consistency in their play and a high level of performance in my time here as manager and I’m delighted they both see their future at this club, which is striving to deliver success,’ McInnes told the club website.
