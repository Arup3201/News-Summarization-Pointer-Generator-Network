Roy Hodgson is sending an FA delegation to assess the state of the pitch in Manaus amid concerns about the poor surface quality.

Pictures emerged on Wednesday of a poorly prepared surface inside the Arena da Amazonia ahead of England's opening group game there against Italy on Saturday.

Patches: The pitch appeared dry in places and was noticeably bare, just three days ahead of the Group D match

Even the man in charge of Manaus's pitch admitted it was in 'bad shape'.

Hodgson's squad make the four-hour journey by plane deep into the Amazon rainforest on Thursday and will not even practise at the FIFA-appointed training ground.

Instead, the FA revealed that the team will work in the gym on Thursday afternoon before training in the stadium on Friday evening.

England's advance party will check the condition of the pitch - in line with FIFA regulations - and report back to Hodgson at the team hotel.

Carlos Botella, head groundsman for the Royal Verd company which is responsible for the turf at Manaus and six other World Cup stadiums, said: 'Frankly, Manaus is in bad shape. We've started to implement an emergency plan to try to save the field and improve it as much as possible, but I don't think it'll be in good condition by the weekend. We put fertilizer on and we'll increase the fertilizing process with biostimulants and seeds to try to get the most out of the grass.'

England players have so far insisted they are not concerned about the quality of the pitch, but behind the scenes there are genuine reservations about what they are likely to face.

Hodgson is also waiting on positive news for Danny Welbeck after he was forced to miss training yesterday with a strained muscle in his right leg.

The England forward limped out of training on Tuesday and was forced to miss the entire session at their Urac military training centre on Wednesday.

Instead, he worked with physio Gary Lewin but will travel with the rest of the squad to Manaus after a scan revealed there is no serious damage.

On Wednesday, Hodgson juggled his team in training and played Raheem Sterling out on the left during a practice match.

At this stage, it seems a straight fight between Welbeck and Sterling for the final spot in England's starting line up against Italy.

That means Wayne Rooney is likely to start in his preferred No 10 role behind Daniel Sturridge withÂ  Adam Lallana out on the right in a 4-2-3-1 formation.
