Neil Carmichael has criticised the 'unacceptable' figures, saying they should be a 'cause for alarm'

Too many people are undergoing 'unnecessary' leg amputations due to a lack of proper treatment, MPs and peers have warned.

A new report revealed a postcode lottery in the number of people losing legs for diseases including diabetes, with amputation twice as likely for those in the south west compared to those in London.

In 2012/2013, there were almost 12,000 lower limb amputations in England, a figure the report said remains 'stubbornly high'.

The new study from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Vascular Disease is based on Freedom of Information requests to NHS trusts and NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs).

It argued there is a lack of planning of how to treat patients at risk of lower limb disease, with CCGs in areas without a dedicated patient pathway - a treatment plan agreed between departments - having 11 per cent more amputations on average than those with one.

Almost a third of NHS trusts handling vascular and diabetes patients did not have multi-disciplinary teams to manage care, despite evidence they produce better results.

Some 28 per cent of trusts also lacked the teams for peripheral arterial disease, a common condition in which fatty deposits in the arteries stop blood getting to leg muscles.

Tory MP Neil Carmichael said: 'Too many patients aren't getting the treatment they need to avoid losing their legs.

'The figures for parts of the south west of England are particularly alarming, and this needs to be tackled.

'The unacceptably high level of lower limb amputations among people with diabetes in certain areas is a real cause for alarm.

A new report says there were 12,00 lower body amputations on the NHS last year, a 'stubbornly high' figure

'There clearly is a serious problem if some regions of England have much higher amputation rates than others.

'The All Party Parliamentary Group on Vascular Disease, working with the country's top experts in this field, recommends that the Department of Health make reducing lower limb-loss a major priority.

'This is especially important given the country's ageing population.'

Nikki Joule, Diabetes UK policy manager, said: 'This report highlights the unacceptable variation of care across the UK when it comes to diabetic foot care and amputation rates.

'For someone with diabetes, getting the right foot care is essential. This includes having an annual foot check and being referred to a foot protection service if you are at increased risk of a foot attack.

'Up to 80% of amputations are avoidable with good preventative footcare in the community and fast access to a specialist multidisciplinary team when needed.

'Diabetes UK is calling on the NHS to ensure that people with diabetes and health care professionals recognise the importance of addressing acute foot care problems quickly and that there are services in place to ensure that people can access the right care at the right time.'
