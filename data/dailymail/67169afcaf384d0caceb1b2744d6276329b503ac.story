Guilty: Janet Goldstone stole £72,228 from company accounts over three years and has now been jailed for 21 months

A bookkeeper has been jailed for swindling her employer out of more than £70,000 to pay for foreign holidays, a new car and her son’s wedding.

Three Way Precision Sheet Metal, in Shoebury, Essex, was forced to lay off staff, after Janet Goldstone stole £72,228 from company accounts over three years.

She was only caught when one director became suspicious after she pestered him to sign off company cheques just weeks before she went on holiday.

Paul Whitehouse took a note of the payee and visited the company named on the cheque where he discovered Three Way Precision Metals no longer had an account with them.

He contacted the bank and found Goldstone had altered the cheque to pay herself the money.

Goldstone, 52, from Canvey, was handed a 21 month prison sentence when she appeared at Basildon Crown Court on Monday.

The court heard Goldstone started working for the company, based in Towerfield Road, in 2006 as a temporary book keeper.

She was eventually taken on permanently, in a role that paid £25,000 per year, and was responsible for payroll, BACS payments and company cheques.

Between 2009 and 2012 she raised 34 cheques, worth £29,000, paid to herself and her husband’s bank account.

She also made 37 BACS payments to herself totalling £42,000.

She would write cheques out in pencil, get them signed by the company directors, then change the details on the cheque.

The court heard she initially stole the cash to pay for repairs to her home after it was ruined by a cowboy builder.

However, she became greedy frittering the money on exotic holidays to Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Mexico.

She also bought a Range Rover and put £2,500 behind the bar at her son’s wedding reception.

The court heard Goldstone lied to her family and friends about where the cash came from - telling them she had received a PPI payout.

 director Ronald Williams said: 'We trusted her. The three company 
directors have given their lives to building up this company.

'This has had a huge impact on us. We have had to lay off staff and have suffered sleepless nights and ill health.'

Matthew Bone, mitigating said his client was now 'a shell of her former self'.

He said: 'She won’t forgive herself for what she has done.

 'She feels worthless and was extremely distressed when she heard of the redundancies'

'She feels worthless and was extremely distressed when she heard of the redundancies.'

Goldstone, who was dressed in a baby pink shirt and jeans sobbed as she was sentenced by Recorder Martyn Royall.

He said: 'This was an abuse of your position as bookkeeper and a serious breach of trust.

'You have heard the shock and disappointment of the directors.

'I have no other option than to make a custodial sentence.'

Speaking after the trial, Mr Whitehouse who uncovered the scam said: 'This incident has really undermined our trust in people.

'We are pleased with the outcome - she put the business under a lot of threat.

'We trusted her and because of what happened the firm has had to cut back on staff and machinery.

'Since this incident, our staffing levels have dropped from about 100 to 50. 

'It is disappointing and upsetting because we were always very fair with her.'
