A pregnant 16-year-old girl and her 17-year-old boyfriend have been arrested after police discovered a woman lying, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the head, in front of her North Carolina home.

Daniel Rhoney and Elizabeth Paige Fowler have been charged with attempted murder in the shooting of Rhoney's mother, Sherri Rhoney, and are being held at the Catawba County Sheriff's Office.

Just hours earlier, Fowler spoke to reporters about arriving home to find the injured woman bleeding in the yard.

'They lied to you': Elizabeth Fowler and Daniel Rhoney told reporters tearfully that they had no idea who had shot Rhoney's mother, Sherri, who was discovered bleeding in her front yard

Sherri Rhoney was found beaten and 
covered in blood in her front yard by off-duty deputies on Wednesday 
morning and was airlifted to Carolinas Medical Center with serious 
injuries.

The Hickory Record
reports that Fowler told investigators that she and her boyfriend 
Daniel Rhoney had pulled into the driveway and found Sherri Rhoney 
covered in blood and unresponsive.

'It scared me to death and we got out and tried to help her and I didn't know what to do,' a crying Fowler told reporters on Eyewitness News.

According to the Charlotte Observer, Daniel Rhoney and Elizabeth Fowler were inside Sherri Rhoney's Old Shelby Road house at the time of the discovery.

Reporters spoke to the teenagers at the scene, who were tearful and denied any knowledge of the shooting.

'She's a very helpful woman. I'm seven months pregnant and she has done everything for me and my child. I can't believe somebody would hurt her,' Fowler said on camera.

Sheriff Coy Reid said investigators had determined that Daniel Rhoney shot his mother in the head following an argument, and that Fowler had participated in beating the woman before she was shot.

'They lied to you,' Reid told Eyewitness News later. 'No doubt in my mind about that.'
