The mother of a missing newborn found dead earlier this week has been charged with murder.  

Yolo County sheriff’s deputies discovered 20-day-old Justice Rees near wetlands along the Sacramento River in Knights Landing, California on Wednesday after a night of searching following a call from the boy's mother Samantha Green, who reported him missing and claimed the two had been abducted.

Now, Green, who was found in wetlands nearby bruised and crying, has been charged with murder and was picked up Saturday at around noon by authorities.

Green was arrested around noon on Saturday and charged with murder 

The charges against Green were announced by Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto at a news conference, according to the Los Angeles Times.

He did not give any information as to why they decided to charge Green, but did say that authorities were not able to substantiate claims that she had been abused.

'At this point here, we don’t have anyone else that was involved,' said Prieto.

'No stone was left unturned.'

News 10 reported that Ricardo Villaseñor came upon Green shortly after that call, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough.

Villaseñor said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river.

'She was badly bruised,' said Villaseñor. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' 

She told him she knew her baby was dead, having frozen to death, and though she said she didn't know the exact location of Justice, she said he was somewhere in the slough. 

Police arrived around 5:30pm and found her 2011 Chevy Tanverse on the other side of the slough, separated from where the mother was by trees and brush.

Sheriff's deputies launched a search that lasted through the night and into the morning, combing water and vegetation before finally finding Justice's remains shortly before 10am Wednesday.

A spokesman for the sheriff's and coroner's office Captain Larry Cecchettini said the boy was 'located in a thicket of brush right off the slough.'

The plan was for officers 'to cut a path to get in there to remove the body,' according to Cecchettini, his voice faltering in his announcement.  

Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and has since been released.

Green's father, Randy, told the Sacramento Bee that he'd spoken to her last on Saturday before she was planning to bring Justice to the house for a visit. 

Randy Green said that his daughter did not show up that day, and on Monday her mother and her sister reported her and the baby missing. 

Mother: Green had given birth to Justice only 20 days before she turned up next to the slough, crying and seeming disoriented

Family: Justice's grandfather said the boy's parents, Green and Frank Rees (right), were loving and fussed over the little baby

Loss: The grandfather, Bill Rees, also said that he was having a hard time believing Justice was dead, as his house - where Justice had been living with his parents - was filled with baby clothes and a bassinet 

On Tuesday, Justice's father, Frank Rees posted on Facebook begging Green to come home with the baby.

'If anyone sees my beautiful fiancé [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 

'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.'

After police identified the body as Justice on Wednesday, the family of the little boy mourned, still in disbelief.

'They loved baby Justice,' said paternal grandfather Bill, whom Justice and his parents had been living with in Woodland. 'Frank just loved to carry him around at night when he was, he was fussing. Samantha, gosh, I understand she's crushed.'

'It's like it's not real for me, it's like I can't imagine you know,' Rees added. 'This whole house is full of baby clothes, bassinet, all that stuff.'
