Liverpool remain hopeful that Luis Suarez will stay at Anfield at the start of the season despite the rumblings of intent emanating from Spain.

Barcelona and Real Madrid will both make bids for Suarez this summer but so far none have been received.

Liverpool have enquired about the availability of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona, who the Catalans are willing to sell, but a part-exchange deal involving Suarez has yet to be discussed.

Barcelona media believe that Uruguay striker Suarez has taken the decision to leave Liverpool this summer and the comments he made following Thursday's defeat of England have given them and Real Madrid encouragement. However, Liverpool have yet to receive any such indication.

Although a figure of £82million has been mentioned, Suarez and his camp say there is no release clause in his latest contract and that indicates it will all be down to how much money either club throw at the project.

Madrid have long been considered favourites but they have a side issue with Karim Benzema's contract talks that could yet have a bearing on the speed of their move for Suarez.

Should Benzema agree terms on a proposed £7m a year deal it is possible they may even postpone a major assault for Suarez until next year.

They are selling Alvaro Morata, and are willing to listen to offers for Angel di Maria, Sami Khedira and Fabio Coentrao. All have been linked with Liverpool but di Maria and Khedira, particularly, may have more relevance to Chelsea if Madrid continue to push for Carlo Ancelotti favourite Ramires.

Monaco striker Radamel Falcao is also being offered to Madrid which, it is understood, he would prefer despite interest from other clubs.
