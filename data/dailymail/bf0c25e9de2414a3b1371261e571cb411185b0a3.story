A teenage boy is facing ten years in prison after allegedly taking multiple late-night joyrides - in a plane.

Geoffrey Biteman, 18, allegedly taught himself how to fly before stealing a plane in Roseau, Minnesota.

The plane, a small Cessna 150 from 1971, belongs to Major Joshua Rasmussen of the U.S. Air Force, who is currently serving in Afghanistan. His brother Army Major Adam Rasmussen recently put the plane up for sale and Biteman came to look at the aircraft.

The 18-year-old took the plane for a test
flight, then said he would look elsewhere. Unknown to the brothers, 
Biteman was flying the plane all over the state this summer.

Biteman faces a felony charge with up to ten years in prison. The Federal Aviation Administration has launched an inquiry over the unregistered flying.

The teenager was finally caught and arrested on October 22 after admitting to flying the plane without permission and not having a pilot's license.

However he did say he was an aviation mechanics' student.

Roseau Police Chief Ward Anderson told UPI that Biteman flew across Red River to work for a farmer hauling sugar beets.

He added: 'The
kid landed on the highway at 10 o’clock at night, on an unlit highway 
and taxied in to (the farmer’s) yard. It’s like Catch Me If You Can.'

Biteman, who remains in jail, faces up to ten years in prison when sentenced on December 18.
