Fears have grown for a man missing since his boat capsized today after an 'intensive' search operation was called off.

The alarm was raised shortly before 11am when two people were found clinging to the upturned boat in Poole Harbour, Dorset.

They were rescued by helicopter and taken to Poole Hospital and a major operation was then launched to find the third sailor.

The 'intensive search' Coastguard search for the missing man was called off this afternoon

Two other men who were on the small boat today were plucked from the water and taken to hospital by the Coastguard helicopter

Portland Coastguard co-ordinated the air and sea search but the man has not been found.

The Coastguard has announced it has called off the 'intensive three hour search'.

A spokesman said: 'A marker buoy 
placed in the location of the capsized boat indicated that a casualty on
the surface of the water would have remained within the harbour area in
the tidal and weather conditions during the search.'

The search involved two coastguard
rescue helicopters, RNLI lifeboats from Poole and Swanage, Coastguard 
rescue teams and local vessels as well as other members of the emergency
services and the community.

Private boats also took part in the major search operation in Poole, Dorset

The Coastguard said they believe any casualty would have remained within the harbour area

The small boat, believed to be carrying the three men, capsized close to Brownsea Island and the alarm was raised shortly before 11am

The small boat capsized this morning near Brownsea Island and members of the public on the shore dialled 999.

Dom Fraser at the North Haven Yacht Club at Sandbanks told the Bournemouth Echo he understood the three people had been in a dinghy.

He said: 'Around 10.45 I heard people shouting for help. I was about to row over but then the helicopter arrived.

'The water is quite shallow where it happened, to the point where you can stand up.'

Local volunteers also helped search the shoreline and a number of private boats are believed to have been helping the Coastguard.
