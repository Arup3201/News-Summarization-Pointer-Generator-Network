Sprightly Ada Hostler is thought to be the oldest female employee in the UK - still working full-time at the ripe old age of 94.

The great-grandmother has stunned family and friends by insisting she wants to continue putting in a 45-hour week despite breaking her hip last year.

She has been an administrator for Portsmouth-based Storytime Nursery, run by her daughter Janet Storey, 63, for 19 years.

Never wants to retire: Ada Hostler, 94, surrounded by staff, family and children at Portsmouth-based Storytime Nursery, where she works 45 hours a week as an administrator

She works from 8am until 6pm five days of the week and has no plans to retire - ignoring doctors' advice to quit following her injury.

Mrs Hostler, from Portsmouth, Hants, lives by the motto 'you're a long time dead' and even says she's irritated by weekends - because she wants to work.

She added: 'I never thought I would still be working in my 90s, I take one day at a time.

'But I don't ever want to stop. I get cross when it's the weekend because I want to go back to work.

'Doing all the figures helps keep my brain active and makes me feel younger.

'It's the children that keep me going. I love being around them. They are great company.'

Born to work: Ada (third left in white dress), pictured in 1926, started out as a teacher but had to move into office work after the outbreak of the Second World War

Ada was born in Naples, Italy, and trained as a teacher, but was forced to move in to office work after the outbreak of the Second World War.

During the war she met and fell in love with her future husband Peter, a sailor from Portsmouth.

The couple married in Italy after the war was over and moved to Portsmouth together in 1945 when Ada was 26.

Janet said: 'My mother has always been very active, she never stopped when she was younger.

'She enjoys the hustle and bustle of a busy life and I think that's why she loves the nursery so much.'

Just last year Ada broke her hip and doctors said she would have to give up work as she would struggle to get around.

But within months she was up and walking again, with the help of a frame.

Widowed Mrs Hostler added: 'I want to make the most out of life. You are dead a long time and don't have much time to live in comparison.

'I want to make sure that I enjoy all the time I have left.'
