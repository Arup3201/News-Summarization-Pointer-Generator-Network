Barcelona are poised to offer £10m for Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen.

The Belgium international is also wanted by Manchester United and Arsenal would prefer to sell abroad but will take the highest bid with the 28-year-old valued at £12m.

United are to hold a recruitment meeting later this week.

Vermaelen is the current club captain at Arsenal, but was ousted by Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker last season.

He has stayed silent so far this summer, but would be keen to join Barca or United. 

Meanwhile, Louis van Gaal's side have signed FK Vojvodina goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic, 17.

Milinkovic stands at 6ft 7in and has represented his country at U19 level.
