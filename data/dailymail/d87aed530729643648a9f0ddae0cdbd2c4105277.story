Ed Miliband's insistence that 'hell yes' he is tough enough to be Prime Minister has secured Labour a bounce in the polls.

The first full survey since Mr Miliband and David Cameron faced a TV grilling shows Labour has opened up a four-point lead over the Conservatives.

But the party's election strategy was in peril tonight after a senior campaign chief admitted that under Labour plans, borrowing would rise. 

The new YouGov survey has Labour on 36 per cent with the Tories trailing on 32 per cent. The four-point lead puts Labour on course to win 314 seats, with the Conservatives on 251

34 per cent of voters still think Mr Cameron would make the best PM, compared to 19 per cent for Mr Miliband, 9 per cent for Ukip leader Nigel Farage and 5 per cent for Lib Dem Nick Clegg 

Recent polls have put the Tories and Labour within one or two points of each other. But the new YouGov survey has Labour on 36 per cent with the Tories trailing on 32 per cent.

The four-point lead puts Labour on course to win 314 seats, with the Conservatives on 251.

But today Labour was accused of 'letting the cat out of the bag' on plans to increase state borrowing.

Election campaign vice-chairwoman Lucy Powell said the party 'may use some investment borrowing'.

Labour has promised only to eliminate the current deficit on day-to-day spending by the end of the next Parliament, leaving open the option of borrowing money to invest in capital projects. 

The Institute for Fiscal Studies says Labour's plans allowed them to maintain an overall deficit as high as £30 billion by 2020 - at a time when the Tories aim to be running a surplus of £7 billion.'

Ms Powell later insisted she did not recognise the £30 billion figure, telling the BBC's Sunday Politics: 'We are going to balance the books for current expenditure by the end of the Parliament. We may use some investment borrowing for much-needed investment but not for day-to-day spending.

'Those figures are other people's figures. It depends on what the books are like.'

Conservative Treasury minister Priti Patel said: 'The cat's out of the bag - Labour have finally had it dragged out of them that they'd borrow more if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street.' 

In Thursday's TV ocntest, Mr Miliband was called a 'North London geek' who would be torn to shreds by Russian President Vladimir Putin

Jeremy Paxman appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing Prime Minister David Cameron 

Mr Cameron is due to visit Buckingham Palace tomorrow to inform the Queen of the official start of the general election campaign.

Mr Miliband faced the roughest ride during the Sky News/Channel TV battle, the first of the election campaign. 

The Labour leader was challenged by the studio audience about why he was so 'gloomy' and told his brother David would have done a better job.

During a bruising interview with Jeremy Paxman he was called a 'North London geek' who would be torn to shreds by Russian President Vladimir Putin, and admitted Labour mistakes on spending, immigration and not tackling inequality. 

But he hit back at Paxman's claim that Labour cannot win a majority, insisting: 'You're important Jeremy but not that important. It's the British people who decide.'

And challenged about his ability to take difficult decisions, Mr Miliband shot back: But am I tough enough? Hell yes, I'm tough enough.'

The 'hell yes' slogan has bee seized on by the Labour party, which has had it printed on t-shirts for sale to raise money for campaign coffers.

A snap poll by ICM after Thursday's contest showed Mr Cameron was the victor, with 54 per cent saying he was the winner to 46 per cent who backed Mr Miliband. 

But a YouGov survey for the Sunday Times showed 49 per cent thought the Labour leader came across the best as against 34 per cent for the Prime Minister.

However, 34 per cent of voters still think Mr Cameron would make the best PM, compared to 19 per cent for Mr Miliband, 9 per cent for Ukip leader Nigel Farage and 5 per cent for Lib Dem Nick Clegg.

Mr Miliband launched Labour's election campaign on Friday claiming the race to Number 10 was 'neck and neck'.

Labour has also made gains in an Opinium poll for The Observer. The Tories dropped two points to 34 per cent in a week, with Labour unchanged on 33 per cent.

The poll showed Ukip down one point on 13 per cent, while the Liberal Democrats were up one on 8 per cent. The Greens were also up one on 7 per cent.
