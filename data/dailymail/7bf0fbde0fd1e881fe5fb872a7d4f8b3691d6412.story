A man who claims to be a 
contract killer for multiple drug cartels in Mexico and admitted to 
killing dozens of people in several states pleaded guilty on Thursday to
 murder in Alabama and was sentenced to serve 50 years in prison.

Jose Manuel Martinez is also charged in 11 alleged contract killings in California and Florida.

Court
 records show 52-year-old Martinez pleaded guilty to shooting Jose Ruiz 
in Lawrence County in March 2013. Investigators say Ruiz was shot to 
death after making a derogatory remark about Martinez's daughter.

‘He was just matter of fact. The guy disrespected his daughter, so he did what he did,’ said District Attorney Errek Jett.

The
 live-in boyfriend of Martinez's daughter was initially charged in the 
slaying of Ruiz, whose body was found in a field in northwest Alabama, 
said defense attorney Tommy Turner of Moulton.

The
 boyfriend was released after telling authorities about Martinez, who 
opened up about multiple other killings once he was held in the killing 
of Ruiz, said Turner.

Turner said it's unclear exactly how many people Martinez claims to have killed at this point.‘I've heard 36 or 46, but I've never asked him,’ he said.

Martinez was charged last year with the murder of 20-year-old Javier Huerta, left, and 28-year-old Gustavo Olivares-Rivas, right, who were found shot dead inside a pickup truck along a road in 2006

October 21, 1980:

Jett
 said Martinez told investigators about killing people for pay all 
across the southern half of the United States, the West Coast and some 
Midwestern states.

‘It 
was 15 or 16 states he provided details on when he was cooperating,’ 
said Jett. It's unclear how much he is still cooperating now that 
multiple murder charges have been filed, he said.

While
 Martinez is charged in nine contract slayings in California, Jett and 
Turner said he will likely be prosecuted next in Florida because 
prosecutors there placed a judicial hold on him first.

‘He
 was a debt collector and enforcer. The Florida cases stem from two men 
there who owed a huge drug debt, and he's alleged to have been sent to 
Florida to collect the money that was owed,’ Turner said.

The
 Marion County Sheriff's Office in Florida last year charged Martinez 
with murder in the deaths of 20-year-old Javier Huerta and 28-year-old 
Gustavo Olivares-Rivas, who were found shot dead inside a pickup truck 
along a road in the Ocala National Forest in Nov. 8, 2006, according to 
local media reports.

Authorities
 were able to break the case when lab results found Martinez's DNA on a 
cigarette butt found in a soda can in the truck that hadn't previously 
been processed.

Martinez
 told authorities he lured the men to a Volusia County construction site
 because Huerta had stolen 10 kilograms of cocaine worth $210,000.

Martinez told investigators he had Huerta call his wife for the money on Nov. 6, 2006.

The
 wife told authorities her husband called her and told her to remove 
$150,000 from a safe buried in their backyard. She said her husband 
showed up and took an additional $40,000 from inside the home and left.

Martinez told authorities he killed the men so they couldn't identify him to authorities.

Investigators
 say that once Martinez was arrested in Arizona shortly after crossing 
the border from Mexico and sent to Alabama to stand trial he claimed to 
be a contract killer for drug cartels who has killed dozens of people in
 several states.

He 
told authorities he worked for multiple drug cartels but said he would 
never disclose the names or affiliations of his criminal associates.

After
 Martinez began confessing to multiple killings, investigators from 
other law enforcement agencies across the country came to question him.

It
 became clear through interviews that the slayings he spoke of had 
happened and he had information about them that no one else would know, 
authorities said.

Authorities
 in California say he killed six people in Tulare County, two in Kern 
County and one Santa Barbara County between 1980 and 2011. The victims 
ranged in age from 22 to 56, investigators said.

One
 man was shot dead in 1980 driving to work in the morning, while two men
 were shot in 1982 working on a ranch, one surviving.

Life of crime? Martinez claims to have been in a Mexican drug cartel. Such organisations are renowned for their violence, with this picture showing an arsenal of 204 weapons seized from the cartel 'Los Zetas'

The
 same year, another man went missing before being found two days later 
by ranchers shot and stabbed to death. Yet another was found in 2000 
shot to death in bed with his four children at home.

In
 addition to the nine murder counts, Martinez was charged in California 
with one count of attempted murder and the special circumstances of 
committing multiple murders, lying in wait and kidnapping.

Four murder charges include the allegation he committed the crime for financial gain, the criminal complaint says.

The California charges would make Martinez eligible for a death sentence, if he is convicted.

Tulare
 County Assistant District Attorney Anthony Fultz welcomed news of the 
guilty plea and said his office will immediately contact officials in 
Alabama.

He said he wants to start the process to bring Martinez back to California for prosecution.
