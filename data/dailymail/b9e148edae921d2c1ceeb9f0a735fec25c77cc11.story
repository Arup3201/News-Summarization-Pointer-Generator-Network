Louis van Gaal has been left with a £200million conundrum after admitting he will be forced to leave out at least one of his attacking big hitters against Southampton at Old Trafford on Sunday.

With Manchester United’s injury crisis over, Van Gaal’s biggest challenge now is to make sure he does not disrupt the team balance with too many stars after an 11-match unbeaten run.

And the way the Dutchman was talking, he has already decided not to play all of his ‘famous five’ — Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Falcao, Angel di Maria and Juan Mata.

The Dutchman insists he will not hide behind the excuse of squad rotation when selecting his team

Manchester United are in the rare position of having practically their entire squad fit for the visit of Southampton

So far, Van Gaal has not had to make this toughest of choices because at least one of the quintet has always been injured or not match-fit. But the goalscoring return of Di Maria off the bench at Yeovil last weekend means all five are available.

It is a decision Van Gaal has typically promised not to shirk and to his credit he insists he will not hide behind the excuse of rotation.

‘I have said for years the highest number of players you can put in who are mostly creative is four. I still have the same opinion in 25 years. Four is a lot. So when you call these players then I have to choose,’ said Van Gaal.

‘I always put in the best line up, not rotation. You understand the difference?

‘You can call it rotation if a player is tired and then it’s better to play with the other quality player, but normally I look at the qualities of my opponent, the qualities of my selection and also the mental situation of my players.’

Wayne Rooney         17         8           5

Radamel Falcao        11         3          3

Juan Mata                 15         5          3

Angel di Maria           13         3          6

Robin van Persie       19         8          3

Wayne Rooney (£27million), captain and close to overtaking Sir Bobby Charlton as the club’s record goalscorer, is probably the only one who will wake up fully confident of being selected to start.

Van Persie (£24m) has never been dropped in his United career and was Van Gaal’s captain at the World Cup but is no longer ‘bomb proof’ due to competition for places.

Falcao, who will cost £43m if United make his loan move permanent next season, showed his finishing skills to save his team in their last Premier League game at Stoke on New Year’s Day but Van Gaal questions his contribution outside the penalty area.

Juan Mata (£38m) was tipped to be the sacrificial lamb when Van Gaal arrived but has been in outstanding form as a genuine No 10. Di Maria (£60m) has been absent with injury while United have embarked on their unbeaten run.

He takes risks on the ball that are not normally associated with a Van Gaal team but it would still be a huge call, even for someone of the Dutchman’s inpenetrable confidence, to axe the most expensive player in the Premier League.

Falcao saved his manager's blushes by scoring against Stoke to earn a draw on New Year's Day

Publicly, Van Gaal insists he will not be swayed by the size of a player’s transfer fee. Neither can Ed Woodward or the United board be expected to sanction a move for Falcao if he doesn’t make the first XI, although Van Gaal again says he does not automatically agree with that.

‘You can have in your squad selection more than four creative players. But only in the line-up you can put four players. So there is a big difference,’ he said.

‘It is not for you to decide about Falcao. I have read he is very happy here and wants to stay.

‘I am a different manager. The best players, what I think, make the best team. The money is not interesting. For me, it is not interesting.’

After a tough start to life at Old Trafford with 50 different injuries to contend with, Van Gaal is warming to his task now. United sit third in the table with Chelsea and Manchester City above them and his ambition to be top dog at the end of 2015 doesn’t look unrealistic now.

Leaving Mata out of the starting line-up would likely see Rooney move back out of midfield into the No 10 position

Van Gaal is brave enough to make difficult decisions, including leaving out his former international captain Van Persie

Van Gaal was smiling like a kid in a sweetshop when he announced that he only had one player, Ashley Young, injured and unvailable for Southampton.

Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Luke Shaw and Di Maria are fit again after damaging absences.

Rafael and Falcao should be fully up to speed in terms of match sharpness. Besides fitting in his star forwards, the Dutchman has to continue developing United’s own youngsters James Wilson and Adnan Januzaj.

He hopes in time to produce a side as pleasing on the eye as some of Ferguson’s great entertainers.

‘Of course, I want more as a manager, I want the perfect game and we’ve not played the perfect game, like Ajax and Real Madrid 20 years ago (Ajax won 2-0 at the Bernabeu).

‘I expect more attacking quality from Manchester United and from a team that I coach. So now I coach Manchester United, I expect more attacking quality. If not this year, then next season or the season after that. But I shall improve and you shall see it.’

Ronald Koeman gives short shrift to managers who claim they need more time 

Van Gaal won’t rule out January signings but only if the right player becomes available. If he has to wait for Matt Hummels of Borussia Dortmund, he will wait.

‘I don’t prefer to wait until summer when I can improve my selection. I have shown that with Victor Valdes,’ he said, referring to last week’s signing of the former Barcelona goalkeeper.

‘When we can buy a player who can improve my selection I, or the club, shall buy. Money is not interesting, it is always what I have to say, the quality of the player in comparison with the other players that I have. And I have to compare and I have to decide. The money doesn’t play any role.

‘When I cannot improve my selection then I wait. And then I have to wait maybe a year more, because maybe you think there are so many fantastic players who can join. But it is not like that.’

Southampton will be a tough test. United were extremely fortunate to leave St Mary’s with a 2-1 win last month after a double from Van Persie. Van Gaal’s compatriot Ronald Koeman still has the club on course for an unlikely Champions League challenge.

The two Dutchmen haven’t always been the best of friends — dating back to a rivalry when working together at Ajax — but the United boss couldn’t give Southampton higher praise going into this game.

‘When I see the quality of the players and the coaching staff, I think they could finish in the top four. I think it would be good for English football to have a different club qualifying for the Champions League and I think Southampton have the chance this year.

‘They made it very difficult for us at their ground and I think they will give problems again because they have a very good team. I like the way they play.

‘But we are a month further on from that game and maybe we have improved, I hope so because we are in a process, I hope we have improved so we can show that against Southampton but it shall be very difficult because they are very good.’

While Southampton think about the top four, the four occupying Van Gaal’s mind are his four superstar forwards — and who to send out at Old Trafford.
