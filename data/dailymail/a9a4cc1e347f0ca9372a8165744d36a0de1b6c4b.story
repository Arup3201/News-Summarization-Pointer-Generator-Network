Fans of the Lord of the Rings trilogy could have the chance to own some of the most iconic props and costumes from Peter Jackson's epic series as a rare collection goes to auction.

But they will need to have deep pockets to be in the running to win bids, since lots such as Frodo's sword are expected to fetch up to £125,000 ($200,000).

The exclusive items have been amassed over the past decade by one passionate collector who is second only to director Peter Jackson's official archive in scope.

Magnetic pull: Only those with deep pockets will be able to get their hands on some of the most iconic props from the Lord of the Rings films as they go up for auction, regardless of how much they desire them

Among the lots is 'Gold Master Ring' worn by Elijah Wood throughout the trilogy

The highly-anticipated auction will take place at Julien's Auctions, in Beverly Hills, on December 5, and boasts iconic props and costumes from major characters and memorable scenes in the trilogy.

Among the most-sought after props is the sword of Frodo Baggins, played by Elijah Wood, which is estimated to fetch between £62,000 and £124,000 ($100,000-$200,000); Samwise Gamgee's prosthetic ears and hairy feet which could total £23,000 ($38,000); and Gimli the Dwarf's battle axe estimated to sell for £43,000 ($70,000).

Even 'Gold Master Ring' made by famous Australian jeweller Jens Hansen is up for auction. Hansen made nine prototype gold rings for the film, and the ninth and final ring was made to fit Elijah Wood and worn by him throughout the trilogy.

Executive Director of Julien's Auctions, Martin Nolan said: 'The Trilogy Collection: Props and Costumes from Middle Earth promises to be an epic event and one that will definitely make history.

The total haul from the items is expected to reach a staggering £500,000.
