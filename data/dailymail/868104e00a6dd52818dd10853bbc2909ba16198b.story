Authorities in Zurich will today open 'sex boxes' in a bid to improve the safety of prostitutes and regulate the sex industry

The nine boxes in a former industrial estate have been built at a cost of £1.5 million. 

They will be in use daily, from early evening until 5am.

'Sex box': Drivers can view women in one zone before entering one of 15 secluded shelters

Discreet: The drive-in sex booths are an effort to improve prostitutes' working conditions and take power away from pimps

Customers will cruise past a line of 40 prostitutes before selecting one and negotiating a fee.

They will then drive into one of the wooden sheds, which display safe sex posters.

The boxes are equipped with panic alarms which can be activated if the clients or prostitutes feel in any danger.

Michael Herzig, director of social services for sex workers in the city, said: 'Prostitution is a business basically.

'We
 cannot prohibit it, so we want to control it in favour of the sex 
workers and the population because if we do not control it, organised 
crime is taking over, and the pimps are taking over.'

Workplace: The boxes in Zurich will allow prostitutes to conduct their business in more privacy

Rules of engagement: Clients are shown clearly what acceptable behaviour is, including a ban on photography and more than one customer at a time

Orderly: Located along a clearly marked path, the drive-in structures are for car customers only

The sex workers have to register with a health insurer and buy a 'work ticket' for £3.50 
each night that they work. So far 283 permits have been issued.

Prostitution in Zurich is now confined to the booths and two other zones.

The scheme is supported by residents, who were sick of the effects of street prostitution along the bank of the Limmat river in the city centre.

Similar initiatives are already in use in German cities including Essen and Cologne.
