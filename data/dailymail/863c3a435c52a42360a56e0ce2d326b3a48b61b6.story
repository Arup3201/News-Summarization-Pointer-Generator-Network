Prince Harry proved he is an excellent uncle-to-be when he hand-delivered a teddy bear bought for his unborn niece or nephew.

The young Royal promised a little girl he met in Nottingham that he would to pass on the gift.

And he stayed true to his word this weekend as he was pictured clutching the bear as he arrived home.

True to his word: Prince Harry pictured holding the blue bear he promised to give to his unborn niece or nephew

Baby's first present: The bear was a gift from a girl the Prince met during a visit to Nottingham

He met the girl during the visit to open the headquarters of Headway, in Bradbury House, Nottingham - a brain injury charity that was also supported by his mother, Princess Diana.

After
the trip, Prince Harry flew back to Kensington Palace - the home he 
shares with his brother and sister-in-law - by helicopter

He
was seen strolling across the palace lawns still holding the blue bear,
thought to be a 'Tatty Teddy', and a CD that may have been another 
gift.

William and Kate live in Nottingham 
Cottage, in the north of the palace grounds, while Princess Margaret's 
old apartments are being renovated and Prince Harry lives in a 
one-bedroom former staff apartment nearby.

It comes as Prince Harry's romance 
with girlfriend Cressida Bonas is reportedly 'on the rocks' because she 
is not ready to marry.

The fun-loving Prince, 28, apparently wants to settle down and start a family.

But 24-year-old Cressida wants an acting career, and hates the idea of being a 'trophy wife', friends have said.

Keepsake: The little teddy is believed to be from the From Me To You range and a gift for the unborn baby

The Sunday People has reported that the relationship is not 'firing on all cylinders'.

A friend told the paper that Harry wants to get married and settle down with Cressida.

They
added: 'Sadly for Harry, she thinks she is too young to do that. She 
likes to go out and enjoy herself and is a long, long way off being 
anyone’s wife let alone a royal wife.'

The friend said there are problems with the relationship which are 'irreconcilable'.

The paper said that Cressida has told friends she is far too young to settle down and is scared of Harry's talk of marriage.

Prince William and Kate are also believed to be unhappy about his choice of girlfriend.

William was once linked with Cressida’s half-sister Lady Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, 33, during a temporary split with Kate.

'On the rocks': Prince Harry's romance with girlfriend Cressida Bonas is reportedly in trouble

She is now married to Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson’s son Sam, 27. Harry and Cressida began dating last June and have been regularly seen at  public events and clubs together.

They
were introduced by the Prince’s cousin, Princess Eugenie, 23, at a time
when Harry had been single for 18 months following his split from 
former girlfriend Chelsy Davey, 27.

Cressida's father is Old Harrovian Jeffrey Bonas, and her mother is Sixties cover girl Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, 66.

Friends said despite Cressida having the credentials of a royal bride Harry is not getting what he had hoped from the relationship and is said to be growing 'tired with her dishing out ultimatums.'

The source told the paper: 'If it keeps happening it will be Harry who calls off this relationship.

Harry is also said to miss former girlfriend, Zimbabwean born Chelsy.

They dated for four years but split up for good in 2010.
