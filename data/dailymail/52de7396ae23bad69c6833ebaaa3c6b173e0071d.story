The insider told the publication: 'Ryan is being such a sweet hubby, he's giving her foot and back rubs constantly! He jokes that she doesn't even have to ask anymore, he just automatically does it.'

The former Gossip Girl star recently gushed about how devoted her husband is.

She said: 'He's always good to me. That's like a jerky thing to say because you want to be able to complain about your husband and be that person, but he takes pretty good care of me.'

She also told UsWeekly that becoming a mother was something that she had 'always wanted' from an early age.
