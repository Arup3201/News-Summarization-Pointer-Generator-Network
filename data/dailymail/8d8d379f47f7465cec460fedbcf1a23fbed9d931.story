The fun is over for a hippie mother who left her husband and four children to travel 1,000 miles and join the Occupy Wall Street protests.

Stacey Hessler, 38, swapped the comfort of sunny DeLand, Florida, for the squalor of Zuccotti Park, New York, after following the protests online.

But dramatic photos showed how she was hauled away by police from the protests in Manhattan yesterday - her dreadlocks flying everywhere.

Hessler, who admitted her mother said 
she was ‘very selfish’ for leaving, was arrested for blocking a road 
near the New York Stock Exchange.

‘What
did I do? What did I do?’ she shouted as she was taken away in plastic 
handcuffs by three police officers, reported the New York Post.

She
was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct for blocking 
vehicles and pedestrians after she refused to move, police said.

The
unemployed mother, who left behind four children aged seven to 17, is a
Long Island native and had said she would be at the camp ‘forever’.

Her friends said she had her family’s backing to leave, but one of the firms she is protesting against is the bank her husband used to work for.

'Her family said, "Go, mom, go. This is what you want to do". She’s not being irresponsible'

Curtiss Hessler was employed as a financial adviser for Bank of America before his current position at a local Florida bank.

Mrs Hessler described herself as a ‘roller-derby queen, rock-star musician, activist, dreadlock princess, African-bee keeper and organic vegan freak’.

She also said on her Facebook page that she is a ‘radical unschooling mom of four’ and ‘a surrogate for the second time’.

‘I’m not planning on going home,’ she 
told the New York Post last month. ‘I have no idea what the future 
holds, but I’m here indefinitely. Forever.’

'She
had been following this movement on her own through Facebook and 
YouTube (and) decided she wanted to come to New York,’ a friend said.

'Her
family said, "Go, mom, go. This is what you want to do",’ Lauren 
Napoli, 28, told the New York Post. 'She’s not being irresponsible.'

Thousands of demonstrators took to the 
streets, the stock exchange and the subways on Thursday in the latest 
New York economic protests.

Protesters
singled out officers as another enemy, saying their crowd control 
tactics were an excessive, chilling use of force against free speech.

At
least 300 people were arrested in New York and dozens were arrested 
elsewhere, including five on charges they assaulted police officers.

A New York police spokesman told MailOnline today the department could provide no update on whether Hessler had been kept in cells overnight.

Last night Occupy protesters invaded New York City's Brooklyn Bridge, marking two months since the birth of the movement that has rocked Wall Street and spread to the rest of the world.

Activists, led largely by banner-carrying union members, marched under the backdrop of a powerful light projection on the side of a nearby skyscraper that read: 'We are the 99 per cent'.

It came after a day of clogged streets and tied up traffic across Manhattan, as thousands jammed into Foley Square before and marched into the subway as part of a planned 'day of national action'.

The protest continued into the early hours of this morning until 100 people were left in Zuccotti Park. A rally is planned for Friday against the oppression of the Muslim community in the city.

Police officers last night arrested protesters who walked out onto the bridge’s roadway but otherwise let the marchers pass without incident on the pedestrian promenade.

The demonstrations came two days after police raided and demolished the encampment at lower Manhattan's Zuccotti Park that had served as headquarters of the Occupy movement.

Thursday’s march followed a demonstration earlier in the day near the New York Stock Exchange. Chanting 'All day, all week, shut down Wall Street,' more than 1,000 protesters gathered there.

'You do not have a parade permit! You are blocking the street!' a police officer told protesters through a loudspeaker. The congestion brought taxis and delivery trucks to a halt.

Helmeted police officers broke up some of the gatherings, and operations at the stock market were not disrupted. At least 300 people were arrested in New York.
