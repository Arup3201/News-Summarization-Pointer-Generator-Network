One of the Steubenville rapists has been released from a juvenile detention center less than a year after his conviction for raping a 16-year-old girl following an alcohol-fueled party.

Ma'Lik Richmond, a high school football player who was 16 at the time of the sexual assault, was let out of the Cuyahoga Hills Juvenile Detention Center in Ohio some time around January 1. 

His attorney, Walter Madison, says in a statement that the youth is a 'better, stronger person,' and requests privacy.

Messages left on Monday for Madison seeking further information weren't immediately returned.

Richmond
 was sentenced to one year in March 2013. A judge convicted him and 
fellow Steubenville High School student athlete Trent Mays of raping the
 West Virginia girl in August 2012.

Mays was convicted of using his phone to take a picture of the girl naked. He was sentenced to two years.

Last August, Judge Thomas Lipps classified Richmond as a tier 2 sex offender which means he will be required to register every six months for the next 20 years. 

Unlike adult sex offenders, Richmond's 
name won't be included on publicly accessible websites. And he can 
request to have the sex offender classification removed later based on 
his history of rehabilitation.

NEWS9 received a statement from Richmond's attorney which said: 'The past sixteen months have been extremely challenging for Ma'lik and his extended family.

'At sixteen years old, Ma'lik and his family endured hardness beyond imagine for any adult yet alone child. He has persevered the hardness and made the most of yet another unfortunate set of circumstances in his life, as with each other obstacle, Ma'lik has met it squarely, lifted his chin, and set his shoulders; He is braced for the balance of his life.'

The attorney for rape victim Jane Doe, Bob Fitzsimmons later told the TV station: 'Although everyone hopes convicted 
criminals are rehabilitated, it is disheartening that this convicted 
rapist's press release does not make a single reference to the victim 
and her family - whom he and his co-defendant scarred for life.'

The case drew international attention because of the role of texting and social media in exposing the attack and led to allegations of a cover-up to protect the celebrated Steubenville High School football team.
