Lionel Messi seems to be getting a bit carried away in training ahead of the most important match of his life.

The Argentina superstar would have been forgiven for taking it easy before Sunday's World Cup final against Germany as his country need him on top form.

But, instead, the 27-year-old executed an overhead kick as the Argentina stars played a game of foot volley.

Argentina will be encouraged that Messi is looking so energetic after claims from the superstar's father that the forward has been struggling at the World Cup because he is exhausted.

Messi has covered less distance on the pitch than any outfield player who has played six games at this World Cup, apart from Brazil striker Fred.

And Messi's father Jorge told Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo: 'Leo said it looked like his legs weighed 100 kilos (against Holland). He was very tired.'

Earlier in the tournament, Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher suggested that Messi's lack of running could be in order to protect his suspect hamstring, which caused him to miss a lot of the season with Barcelona.

Inaction man: Messi is exhausted, says his father and he has not run a great deal as the table below shows

Least distance covered in World Cup (of players who have featured in six games):

Fred - 47.2km

Lionel Messi - 51.9km

Georginio Wijnaldum - 53.9km

But Carragher also believes Messi is changing his game and becoming more of an old-fashioned playmaker, writing after the last-16 match against Switzerland: 'He doesn’t seem to be running as much, he is waiting for the ball.

'His running stats were the lowest on the pitch against Switzerland, which is evidence of the change in his game - but he caused maximum trouble and won the match for Argentina.

'The more I study his performances, the more I believe he’s in control and waiting for that moment to arrive when he can make a difference.'
