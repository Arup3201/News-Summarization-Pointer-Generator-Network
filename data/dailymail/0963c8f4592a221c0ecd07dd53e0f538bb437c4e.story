Made with top notch luxury ingredients including Japanese Wagyu beef and Tellicherry peppercorns from India, this pasty, which costs a staggering £230, is the world's most expensive.  

The savoury snack also contains potatoes from Illinois, US, onions from France, swede from Scotland and flour from Holland.

Dubbed the Very Important Pasty, the Cornish treat is the creation of chef Richard Shaw, from Southwick, Hampshire, who tracked down ingredients from all over the world to make it.

The ingredients for the snack have travelled a total of 11,300 air miles to make it to the Very Important Pasty. 

Mr Shaw created the expensive pasty in the hope it will win this year's World Pasty Championships.

The 33-year-old said: 'We came eighth in the contest last year but that was due to a lack of experience. 

To be called a Cornish pasty it must be made in Cornwall and be a ' savoury 'D' shaped pasty which is filled with beef, vegetables and seasonings'.

It must contain sliced or diced potato, swede and onion, and the vegetable content must be at least 25 per cent of the whole pasty.

Diced or minced beef must account for at least 12.5 per cent. Seasoning is also required 'primarily salt and pepper'

'These days we are turning over 3,000 pasties a week and with the VIP we're going for gold.'

The father-of-six, who runs Southwick Village Store, added: 'All of these ingredients will be used to create three pasties.

'There will be one for us all to eat, another for the world championships and the third going for auction to raise money for a hospice.'

This is not the first ambitious pasty that Mr Shaw has created.

Last year he made the world's hottest pasty using ghost chillies, one of the hottest chillies on earth.

He also created three D-Day pasties containing snails, spam and boeuf bourguignon to commemorate the June 1944 landings

Held at the Eden Project in Cornwall, the World Pasty Championship is a global competition celebrating traditional pasties as well as more exotic varieties.

The Very Important Pasty will be judged on Saturday 28 February alongside 600 other entrants from all over the world. 

Wagyu steak from Japan - considered to be one of the best steaks in the world and costing £500 per kilogram. - is also used in the pasty. 

Wagyu is famed for its high fat content and delicate marbling. The fat streaked through the meat melts into the steak as it is cooked, enhancing the flavour and texture.

Cows that produce Wagyu steak are believed to be given massages and fed beer.

Makes two pasties  

Pastry ingredients: 225g plain flour, plus extra for dusting, pinch of salt; 50g lard, chilled and diced; 50g hard margarine, chilled and cut into cubes

Filling ingredients: One potato, peeled and thinly sliced; 50g swede, peeled and thinly sliced; 115g beef skirt or chuck steak, finely diced; quarter small onion, thinly sliced; salt and ground white pepper; beaten egg or milk to glaze. 

Method: To make the pastry, mix together the flour and salt and rub in the fats. 

Gradually stir in two to three tablespoons cold water and bring everything together with your hands to form a smooth, pliable dough. Divide the dough into two balls. 

Preheat the oven to fan 180C/400F/gas 6. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. On a floured work surface, roll out one ball of dough and trim to form a circle about 20cm/8in across. 

Slightly off-centre of the circle, place a layer of potato, then a layer of swede. Add half the beef, then half the onion, then a pinch of salt and plenty of pepper. Finally, add another thin layer of potato, to stop the meat from drying out. 

Carefully fold the pastry over and crimp the edges together (using a little beaten egg to seal, if wished). Place on the lined baking sheet. Repeat to make the second pasty. 

Glaze with a little milk or beaten egg and make a small hole in the top. Bake for 40 minutes until golden brown. Serve hot or cold.
