A glossy video that features baby Jesus gurgling in his manger has been released today in an attempt to win back the festive season from some of the High Street's biggest names. 

The advert - which shows a modern family transform into Mary, Joseph and Jesus - is supported by leading Christian groups, who hope to remind the British public of the real meaning of Christmas.

The 45-second clip comes in the wake of a series of high-profile adverts from retail giants including John Lewis, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer - all that lay claim to the magic of Christmas. 

Family: The 45-second clip, which was uploaded to YouTube this morning, starts with a man and woman sitting in their living room - their baby in a wicker basket on the carpet in front of them

True meaning: The roaring fire and twinkling decorations of the room are stripped away, and the man and woman go from wearing Christmas jumpers to robes - their infant child now lying in a manger

But organisers of new video say that it is not twinkling fairies, First World War chocolate bars or a penguin love story that lies at the heart of the season - it is the story of the birth of Jesus Christ.

The hope is that the video, which is part of a wider campaign called Christmas starts with Christ, will go viral - much like the High Street offerings that have come before it.

Francis Goodwin, head of the Christmas starts with Christ campaign, said: 'The supermarket ads, which were released last month, offered a feel good take on Christmas designed to influence consumers into spending money with them.

'But they all avoided any reference to the religious meaning of the season. We thought it was time to produce the Christmas ad which the supermarkets are unable to make – one which shows where the feel good factor comes from. 

'We are asking people to watch it, judge for themselves and share it with friends.'

The clip starts with a young couple sat in front of their Christmas tree - their infant child in a wicker basket on the floor in front of them.  

As a choral rendition of the Power Of Love plays, the roaring fire and twinkling decorations of the room are stripped away, and the man and woman go from wearing Christmas jumpers to robes. 

In a matter of seconds, the sumptuous living room is transformed into the stable in Bethlehem where Jesus was born - and the giggling baby is now lying in the manger in a bed of straw.

It ends with the words Christmas starts with Christ and the hashtag #ChristmasStarts - inviting viewers to share the video, and their responses, on social media.

While Christian groups have previously funded joint billboards, posters and radio adverts to invite people to attend church, it is the first time that they have paid for a video advertisement as part of a social media campaign.

And, costing just £10,000 to make – one seven hundredth of John Lewis's Christmas campaign – the advert's budget is in keeping with its conservative message.

The Church of England, the Evangelical Alliance and Bible Society, are among the churches and Christian charities that are supporting the video, which was uploaded to YouTube this morning. 

Steve Clifford, general director of the Evangelical Alliance, said: 'Despite the attempts of our leading supermarkets, the magic of Christmas does not lie in celebrities singing about turkeys, nostalgic chocolate bars or happy penguins. 

'There really has to be more to Christmas than a battle between Sainsbury's, John Lewis and Marks & Spencer – or between X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing. 

'The "Christmas starts with Christ" video ad takes viewers to the moment where Christmas began.'
