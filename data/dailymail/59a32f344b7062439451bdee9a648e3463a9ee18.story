Germany's 7-1 humiliation of hosts Brazil in the semi-finals of the World Cup had statisticians rewriting history practically every time Joachim Low's side touched the ball.

Brazil's dreams of winning the tournament in their home country were effectively ended by a first-half masterclass that saw the Germans score five goals in the opening 29minutes - the fastest time it has ever taken a team to reach that figure in World Cup history.

But, that wasn't the only record to fall on an astonishing night in Belo Horizonte...

Seventh heaven: The Germans dished out the heaviest defeat in Brazil's history

Worst loss in Brazil history

The 7-1 scoreline was equal to the worse defeat in the history of Brazilian football.

The Selecao were beaten by 6-0 by fellow South Americans Uruguay in 1920 - nearly a century ago.

This was also Brazil's heaviest World Cup defeat, the next being their 3-0 loss to France in the 1998 Final.

By contrast, Spain only scored eight goals during the entire tournament to win the 2010 World Cup.

Most World Cup goals

Germany have now scored 221 World Cup goals, to move one ahead of their hapless opponents as the tournament's highest ever scorers.

Germany (10) only had two more shots on target than Brazil (8) in this match.

Germany scored two more goals tonight than England have in their past two World Cup campaigns combined.

Heaviest World Cup semi-final defeat

No other team has ever scored seven goals in the semi-finals of the World Cup.

Germany's six goal victory was the heaviest semi-final defeat in the tournament's history, ahead of West Germany's 6-1 defeat of Austria in 1954 and Uruguay's win by the same scoreline against Yugoslavia in 1930.

Germany netted as many goals in this semi-final as they had in their previous six World Cup semi-finals (1982-2010).

It is the first time since 1938 that Brazil have lost a World Cup semi-final, they had progressed in their previous six.

Most goals conceded by Brazil at World Cup

It was also the first time that Brazil had conceded more than five World Cup goals since 1938, although on that occassion they managed to comeback to beat Poland 6-5 after extra-time.

Furthermore, Brazil have not let in seven goals at home... ever!

Brazil have conceded eight in a game before during a 8-4 friendly defeat to Yugoslavia on 3 June 1934.

Most goals scored against the World Cup host nation

Brazil is the SECOND host team to let in seven goals in a World Cup match, following Switzerland's 5-7 defeat to Austria in 1954.

The next highest was Brazil who managed to score five against hosts Sweden in 1958 during a 5-2 victory.

Standing alone: Miroslav Klose became the tournament's leading scorer with 16 goals

VIDEO Disbelief in Belo Horizonte after devastating Germany win  

All-time record goalscorer at World Cup

Miroslav Klose added salt to Brazilian 
wounds by netting his 16th goal at the World Cup finals to move clear of
 Ronaldo as the competition's all-time leading scorer.

And, Germany have NEVER lost a match where their talisman Klose has scored the first goal.

Muller scores Germany's 2,000th goal

Thomas Müller could yet take home the Golden Boot after moving to within a goal of Colombia's James Rodriguez when he scored the opener for his his fifth strike, which also happened to be Germany's 2,000 in history of Die Mannschaft.

Müller is the third player (after Cubillas and Klose) in history to score five or more goals in two different World Cups - he has scored 10 goals and provided six assists in just 12 World Cup matches.

Fastest brace in World Cup history

Toni Kroos' first-half double, which came in just 69 seconds, was the fastest brace in the history of the competition.

Fastest four goals scored in World Cup history

Joachim Low's side scored four goals in the space of six minutes (from 23 to 29). That has never been done in World Cup history.

Unhappy ending: Brazil conceded seven goals - five during the first-half - to end their World Cup dream

Brazil's second heaviest defeat was probably the only other match that could compare in the misery stakes, despite it being a friendly, since it came against arch rivals during a 6-1 hammering in 1940.

Germany's highest half-time lead

After their opening blitz, Germany achieved their highest half-time lead in a World Cup game. Their previous best was 4-0 against Saudi Arabia at the 2002 tournament, which eventually saw them record their greatest win with an 8-0 victory.

Only three teams have previously trailed by five goals at half-time: Zaire (1974), Haiti (1974)... and Brazil (1938).

Most goals scored in a World Cup semi-final

No other team has ever scored seven goals in the semi-finals of the Worl;d Cup, and may never do so again.
