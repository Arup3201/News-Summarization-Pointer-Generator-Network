The son of TV mogul Mark Burnett is recovering after being treated for a brain tumor.

Cameron Burnett, 16, underwent surgery for the tumor last month, with his family and friends calling for prayers online.

Mark, 54 - dubbed the father of reality TV - has made a reported $86 million fortune after bringing hits including The Apprentice, Survivor, The Voice and miniseries The Bible to our screens.

Cameron's older brother James and his mother Dianne detailed the crisis they were swept into, as James wrote: 'We need all the love and prayers we can...as my brother  recovers from surgery.

'They had to remove a growth in his pituitary gland which is located right under the brain, and has apparently been growing for the past ten years.'

James said Cameron had gone through a nine-hour surgery, but still 'managed to crack a laugh', calling him: 'A strong man', and telling him: 'Cam, I love you.'

Dianne, Mark's first wife, wrote on Facebook late last month:  'A new day. What we take for granted saying the simple words I love you came from Cameron's lips today. I am feeling so blessed. My heart filled with love and joy. Thank you God.'

Cameron was welcomed home earlier this month and today, Dianne told MailOnline: 'Cameron's doing much better, he's going to be absolutely perfect.

'He is going to have some recovery time, but it won't be very long.'

Multi-millionaire Mark, 54, is a Brit who found fame and fortune after moving to the States in 1982. He had his two sons James and Cameron with his second wife Dianne. 

And he married actress and producer Roma Downey, a fellow Brit, in 2007. Roma has a daughter called Reilly from her first marriage.

He was named one of Time's most influential people in the world today and has turned his major talents to the world of Christian entertainment.

His History Channel miniseries, The Bible, won 13 million viewers when it debuted last year. So far it has been seen by more than 100 million viewers globally.

Mark and his wife, Roma Downey, then released the movie Son of God, which grossed $68 million at the global box office. The couple is now helping Paramount and MGM make a big-budget remake of Ben-Hur and working on a sequel to The Bible, titled A.D.

The couple have frequently  talked about their faith and both want the bible to be taught in public school in the US.

Mark said: 'I grew up with a Presbyterian mom and a Catholic dad. And never a bad word between them. Especially on the subject of the Bible. I don’t remember ever as a kid not having bibles in our house.'

Roma added: 'Faith is deeply important to me, has been since I was a child. I was raised in a family of faith. I’ve always found deep comfort in it, was particularly thrilled in the early ‘90’s to be cast to play an angel on “Touched by an Angel,” which as you know ran for almost 10 years and delivered a central message of God’s love. It was such a privilege to be the messenger on that and my old Irish father used to say 'the family that prays together stays together'.'

Speaking about The Bible, Mark said: 'We’ve approached this as God’s love story, God’s love of all of us. There’s only one perfect character in the entire 66 books. That’s Jesus Christ. Everybody else, to lesser or greater degrees, are flawed, like all of us.

'And people have huge problems, I mean, in kings, but still God didn’t give up. And that’s the message. It’s like an unconditional love story.'

In September 2014, movie studio MGM acquired a 55 per cent interest in One Three Media and Lightworkers Media, both run by Mark and Roma.

The two companies have been consolidated into a new film and television company, United Artists Media Group. Burnett is UA's CEO and Roma is president of Lightworkers Media.
