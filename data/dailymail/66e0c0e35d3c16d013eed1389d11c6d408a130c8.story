Relationship break-ups can be tough and sometimes they can take their toll on your body. Some of us might lose weight on the heartbreak diet, others may gain it through comfort eating.

Lisa Warmington, from Warwick, fell into the latter category when she split with her boyfriend two years ago – and gained two stone.

'I felt depressed and found myself comfort eating. Any time of the day really, it just made me feel better for a few minutes,' admits Lisa, 30.

Standing at 5ft 9in, Lisa dropped from 13st and a size 14 to 11st in just eight weeks  

'I was actually aware that I was gaining weight but I just didn’t care as I felt down.

Lisa’s formerly svelte figure grew from 11st to 13st and – as her before pictures show – she gained a dreaded muffin top and added bulk to her thighs.

'There were times when I would try to lose weight, but I’d slip back into the habits of snacking on chocolate and so on,' admits Lisa.

'But then there was a moment when I thought that I didn’t want to be like this anymore, and I needed to take charge of it now – if not now, it’s never.'

Lisa’s extra weight knocked her confidence especially hard as she had always enjoyed a slim figure and had never had any issue with her weight.

'To me it felt like the end of the world,' she confesses. 'I even considered a gastric band, even though I know they are risky.

'But then I decided I would do it the healthy way and give myself a proper length of time to lose a proper amount of weight.

'I’d always enjoyed exercise in the past, so I signed up to No1 Boot Camp for eight weeks.

'My goal was to lose the two stone I’d gained within that time. When I arrived at the base in Norfolk I was a Size 14 and – at 5ft 9in. I know that won’t sound heavy to everyone but it wasn’t ‘me’.

Lisa admits that it was hard work and there were tears, but never lost sight of the eventual pay-off.

'At the end of each week, you see the weight you’ve lost and it spurs you on,' she says.

By the fourth week, Lisa had visibly worked off her stubborn tummy fat and an enviable waistline was forming. Her self-confidence was also growing.

Lisa did three daily exercise sessions as well as an hour and half hike every day, meaning that by week 4 (pictured) the changes in her body were already noticeable

'You do adapt to the exercise – at the start I could barely run, towards the end the team had to set me tougher challenges,' she adds.

'I rarely felt hungry. I struggled a bit at first withdrawing from sugar but after a couple of weeks that passed. We were allowed a treat at the weekend, but you don’t really feel like it.'

Lisa left boot camp two weeks ago – at her target weight of 11st and feeling back in possession of a lean, toned body to be proud of.

'I’m at my happy weight,' she smiles. 'It feels great to be back in my old clothes. I’ve found my motivation has stayed strong, I don’t want to put weight on like that again.

'I’m heading back to Norfolk to see the team soon as I want to maintain my weight.'

Lisa reveals that she also feels so much better emotionally. 'Before, after the split, I was so down, but now I’m fine being single – although I’m obviously open to meeting someone again now.'
