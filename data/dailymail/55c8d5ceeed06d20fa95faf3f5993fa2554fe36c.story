The family of a film worker who was killed in a train accident while shooting a movie near Savannah has reached a settlement with several defendants in a civil suit.

A statement from the Harris Penn Lowry law firm Wednesday said the settlement in a suit filed by the family of 27-year-old camera assistant Sarah Jones includes Unclaimed Freight Productions, Inc., Rayonier Fibers, LLC, and several others.

Jones was killed the first day of filming for a movie on musician Gregg Allman in February and attorneys say the terms of the settlement are confidential.

Settlement: The family of a film worker who was killed in a train accident while shooting a movie near Savannah has reached a settlement with several defendants in a civil suit

Confidential: A statement from the Harris Penn Lowry law firm Wednesday said the settlement with Unclaimed Freight Productions, Inc., Rayonier Fibers, LLC, and several others will remain confidential

The statement says CSX railroad and Meddin Studios are still listed as defendants.

Her death sparked a renewed discussion about precautions on film sets, as Jones' father, Richard Jones, says his family is continuing to advocate for safety on film sets through the Sarah Jones Film Foundation.

Hairstylist Joyce Gilliard, who suffered an arm injury in the crash, said those involved in the shoot had been told that if a train comes, 'you have 60 seconds to get off the track'.

Referring to Miss Jones's death on February 20, she added: 'At first it was like a quiet, like people were in shock at what happened. I remember hearing somebody say "Oh my gosh, she's dead".' 

After carrying out a number of inquiries, investigators determined the filmmakers went onto the railroad bridge to shoot the footage after CSX Transportation denied them permission.

A letter to location manager Charley Baxter seemingly confirms officials' findings, reading: 'Unfortunately CSX is not able to support your request.'

Meanwhile, director Randall Miller is reportedly said 'that's not my job' when asked questions on why he didn't know that there could be a train barreling down on his crew.

The Jones's attorney, Jeff Harris, said: 'You don't shoot on a railroad track unless you have permission to be there.'

Miss Gilliard, who is also suing Miller and others involved in the shooting added: 'They wanted to get the shot, so whatever it took to get the shot is what they did.

Officials say filmmakers went onto the railroad bridge without permission 
Miller and others accused of involuntary manslaughter

'The entire crew was put in a situation where we all had to basically run for our lives.' 

On Thursday, Mr Harris said the Joneses have decided to dismiss all claims against Allman - an executive producer of the film based on his life story - after reviewing evidence in the case.

'It is clear that Mr. Allman ... had no involvement in any of the decisions that resulted in Sarah's death,' he said in a statement.

Allman - who was dismissed alongside two others - was among 10 individuals and eight corporations named as defendants in May when the Joneses filed their lawsuit in Savannah.

The couple is still seeking damages from others, including Miller, railroad firm CSX Transportation and Rayonier Performance Fibers, which owns the property surrounding the crash site.

Miller and three other filmmakers have also been indicted on criminal charges of involuntary manslaughter, a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and trespassing in rural Wayne County where the crash occurred.

Allman's attorney, David Long-Daniels, said the singer had little involvement with the movie other than licensing the rights to his memoir, 'My Cross to Bear', to the filmmakers.

'We're delighted the Jones family has dismissed us,' Long-Daniels said. 'We remain very sorrowful for the tragedy they have endured with the loss of their daughter.'

The Jones family's attorneys said they also dropped claims against Michael Lehman, an executive producer on the film, and Open Road Films, a film distribution and marketing company.

During the 20/20 report, photos of Miss Jones's final hours as a camera assistant were also unveiled, including one of her working beside Hurt, who was lying on the bed on the train tracks.

The bed was being used in a dream sequence that involved Allman lying down and seeing his late brother across the bridge, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

It also aired a 911 call from the set following the fatal train crash, in which someone is heard requesting an ambulance, saying 'someone got hit by a train'.

During her career, Miss Jones also worked on the set of The Vampire Diaries, where she was described as a 'cosmic sister' by actor Ian Somerhalder.

The attorney's comments followed an earlier prepared statement from Miller and Savin in which they said the crash and Miss Jones's death 'will haunt us forever'

Miller and producer Jody Savin's attorney told ABC that the filmmakers believed they had permission to be on the tracks from Rayonier.

They added: 'They had no reason to believe that anyone would be placed in danger. They will live with the sorrow of Sarah's death for the rest of their lives.'

A railroad safety expert also pointed out that the crew had no way of knowing when a freight train might speed down the track because there is no train schedule 'like a major airline might publish'.
