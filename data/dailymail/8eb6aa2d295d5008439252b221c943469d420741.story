Pledge: Ed Miliband said if he won the next election, 200,000 homes would be built by 2020

Labour yesterday outlined controversial plans to create four new towns to plug the housing shortage in southern England.

Ed Miliband, who has promised to build 200,000 new homes a year if his party wins the next election, made clear that new towns and garden cities were key to the plans.

But he also attacked ‘home-blocking’ local authorities who refuse permission for new houses, promising to take action to force them to accept some new developments.

Mr Miliband says that London’s position as a global business capital is under threat because of the lack of affordable housing for young people.

He called for the ‘next generation of new towns’ to be built within commuting distance, but in ‘sustainable locations’ that are resilient to flooding. It is understood that up to four will be built, with at least one intended to take the heat off London.

‘I have made a firm promise: under the next Labour government Britain will again be building nearly 200,000 homes a year by 2020,’ wrote Mr Miliband in yesterday’s London Evening Standard.

‘A key plank will be creating new towns in sustainable locations where people want to live, just like earlier generations did in places such as Stevenage and Milton Keynes.

‘Labour will kick-start the next generation of new towns and garden cities around the capital to ease the pressure on London. Some of the new housing needed will come from taking action against home-blocking local authorities that have frustrated planning proposals from neighbouring authorities for years.’

A spokesman for the Campaign to Protect 
Rural England agreed that more homes needed to be built, but added: ‘The
 challenging questions are where they should go and who will build them,
 and perhaps as crucially, how you are going to get local support.

Development: The new towns would be similar to Stevenage, which saw a huge spike in population during the 1960s and 1970s

Growth: Milton Keynes was developed in the 1960s after the government said a generation of 'new towns' was needed in the south east

‘This is an on-going debate on how best to meet our housing needs while protecting the countryside. The important thing is that they cannot be imposed on communities.’

Garden cities were a concept of urban planning which became popular in the early twentieth century and built at Letchworth and Welwyn in Hertfordshire. They are intended to be self-contained communities surrounded by green belt to combine the best of town and country living.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said yesterday that the Government was speeding up housing compared to when Labour was in office.

‘We’re taking the difficult decisions to deal with Labour’s mess – delivering hundreds of thousands of new affordable homes through proper investment and fixing the planning system,’ he said.
