The grandmother of murdered schoolgirl Tia Sharp today spoke of her 'relief' after Stuart Hazell admitted murdering her and hiding her body.

Angie Niles, whose son David was the 12-year-old's stepfather, revealed how Hazell had torn her family apart and called on a judge to 'lock him up forever and throw away the key'.

Hazell today pleaded guilty to Tia's murder after months of pleading his innocence and insisting the girl's death was a tragic accident.

Her body was found in the attic of the home in New Addington, South London that Hazell shared with Tia's biological grandmother Christine Bicknell, a week after the girl went missing in August last year.

Mrs Niles, 69, said: 'Obviously it's a
very emotional time for all of the family who are sitting here around 
the TV, but in a strange way we also feel relief.

'It
says a lot about the man - just when you thought he couldn't do anymore
to our family, he's dragged this out over months insisting he was 
innocent and only now at the very last moment has he put his hands up 
and admitted what he has done.

'In
a strange way I feel like it had to happen this way - maybe it's good 
that a judge and members of the public have had the chance to hear 
exactly what this sick man has done.

'Maybe it's good for all of us to have heard the truth in court so that none of this was buried, none of this remains secret.

'It does feel like some sort of 
closure, it feels like it was the right time. Now we can get on with 
grieving for my beloved grand-daughter.

'The process isn't easy but now we can get on as best as we can.

'I hope the judge locks him up forever and throws away the key. He doesn't deserve any more than that.'

Although
Tia was not biologically related to Mrs Niles, the pair became 
'extremely close' after her mother Natalie entered a relationship with 
David Niles.

Mrs Niles, whom Tia called 'Nangie', 
added: 'We all have so many happy times in our minds from years gone by 
and everywhere you look there are little reminders.

'I
have a pair of small Christmas trees which Tia picked for me two or 
three years ago, she made me buy them because they were pink and that 
was her favourite colour.

'Since
we lost Tia I don't really go into clothes shops where they sell 
teenagers' fashion, it just reminds me of her. It's a nightmare.

'She
was a real girly-girl, it was all about the clothes and the hair and 
the nails for Tia, so it is very upsetting when I have to walk past 
those things knowing I could have been buying them for her.

'You just have to think about the good times which we were lucky enough to have and not dwell on it too much.'

Tragic: Tia was killed in August last year by Stuart Hazell, right, who today pleaded guilty to murder

In an interview in September before Hazell's trial, Tia's mother Natalie Sharp revealed the horror she felt when police found her daughter's body.

Seven days after Tia was reported missing, Ms Sharp was at a friend's house when she received a call from a detective breaking the news they had found a corpse in the loft.

She said: 'I just hit the floor, I looked up and there were eyes everywhere just 
looking down at me. Those sorrowful eyes were all around just staring.

'I just felt sick. Physically sick, I was vomiting every time I
thought about (the body being in the loft). To know that she was there that whole time.

'You hate the police for missing her, you hate yourself for not finding 
her, you hate everyone who has been in the house, everyone who has been 
near the house.

'I hated everybody.'

Her partner David Niles, Tia's stepfather, refused to believe what the police had said.

He said: 'I couldn’t believe it when they told me, I refused to believe it, I wanted there to have been some mistake.

'We were praying they would tell us a body had been there for thirty odd
years - we were desperate. I remember asking them, "are you sure it’s 
not a cat or a dog?"'

The couple revealed they had received prank calls about Tia in the days she was missing.

Mr Niles said: 'I got a sick prank call to my mobile phone from someone after she’d been missing for around three days.

'They’d just seen my mobile number on the t-shirts we wore for the TV appeals.

'They were saying “we’ve got her and we’ll tell you where and when you can have her. We didn’t know them, they were Scottish.

'It was just some sick drunken joke. The police traced the call and went through their front door somewhere in Scotland.

'Apparently they found a couple of lads sitting around drunk making prank calls. I went mad.'

Ms Sharp added: 'It wasn’t the only time, we had lots of pranks, or at least false messages.

'There were people calling saying they had seen her at a bus stop, someone said they has spotted her asleep on a park bench.

'We had people running around everywhere chasing up messages. For people
to be sitting there having fun at that time, it just makes you so 
angry.

'I’m still angry now.'

She explained how she felt when police were still searching for Tia.

'As the days passed, the range of 
emotions we went through was like nothing I can describe,' she said. 
'I’ve tried to tell people, to put my finger on it, but I can’t.

'You feel empty, like you’re being twisted from the inside. All the way from your stomach to your throat.

'You can’t eat, you can’t sleep. It’s horrible, I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.

'All we could do was wait and waiting 
is the hardest part, because what else can you do? But the more you wait
the more you know in your heart of hearts that it’s not going to 
happen.

'It’s the last thing you think about 
when you go to bed at night and the first thing you think about when you
wake up. It’s still that way now.

'I remember, every day she was 
missing I’d wake up, and open my eyes and things felt normal for a 
second or maybe two. But then there was this kick in your stomach when 
you realised where you were and what was happening.'

She added that her daughter was 'a fighter' who was mature and independent for her age.

She said: 'Once, you accept what has 
happened and you try to come to terms with that, you just want to be 
able to grieve for your child. But we haven’t been able to mourn.

'There’s so much I don’t know, and as a parent I’m supposed to know.

'I don’t know if she was scared, I 
don’t know if she suffered - I don’t know if my baby suffered before she
died. That’s the worst.

'If I know one thing now though, it’s 
this: Tia was a fighter. Whatever happened to her, it wouldn’t have 
happened without a struggle. She could look after herself.

'She used to look after her friends, 
none of them were bullied when Tia was around, she knew to stand up when
something was wrong.

'So the one thing I do know, is that whatever happened, she stood up for herself.'
