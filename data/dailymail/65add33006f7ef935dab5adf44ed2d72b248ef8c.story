Journalist Cokie Roberts has spoken out on the anniversary of President Kennedy's death saying that she doesn't believe the conspiracy theories.

Both of Roberts' parents were members of Congress at the time of the assassination and her father was a member of the official committee tasked with investigating the murder.

Even though her father, Democratic Congressman Hale Boggs, was reportedly unconvinced about the Commission's reliance on the 'single bullet' theory, today Roberts said that belief in the conspiracy theories is effectively a coping mechanism.

Her view: Cokie Roberts said that she thinks the conspiracy theories are based on emotions and not facts as no new technology as proved any of them true

Close ties: Roberts' father was Congressman Hale Boggs (seen left with President Kennedy on October 11, 1963- just a month before the assassination)

'I really think that the problem is that it's very hard for people to accept that one deranged soul could have such an enormous impact. It's so much easier to believe in a conspiracy bc its rational,' she said during an interview on Morning Joe.

Her father was a leader in Congress and accompanied the Speaker to Andrews Air Force Base to receive Air Force One and the President's casket when it arrived from Dallas.

Newly-elected President Johnson later called Congressman Boggs at their family home in Louisiana to ask him to join the investigating committee, which went on to be referred to as the Warren Commission.

'I can remember my father so well saying "We need a blue ribbon commission to put everything to rest so the American people know we have examined every possibility and we know exactly what happened" and of course that didn't happen,' Ms Roberts said.

Searching: After nearly a year-long investigation, the Warren Commission (featuring Boggs, right) produced a 889-page report asserting that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and a 'single bullet' was used to hit both Kennedy and Connally

Political family: Cokie was the youngest child (seen at right in 1947) of Congresswoman Lindy Boggs (left) and Congressman Hale Boggs (center), both Democrats from Louisiana

'Now, he was somewhat skeptical of the single bullet theory and basically he signed the commission report and of course it was unanimous.'

She went on to concede: 'It's somewhat difficult to see the bullet taking that trajectory.'

'Since then we haven't learned anything more that would indicate anything else.

'The House Committee on Assassinations in 1978 with much more technology to examine these things basically came to the same conclusion right up to the last minute when they heard an acoustical report that- to them- sounded like to guns. That report has been discredited.'

The Warren Commission produced an 889-page report and passed their findings on to President Kennedy on September 24, 1964.

Fatal ride: President Kennedy was shot and killed during a motorcade in Dallas

They asserted that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing the President, and nightclub owner Jack Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald before he could stand trial.

More than a decade later, the House Select Committee on Assassinations used improved technology. While they conceded that Oswald did act alone, they did think that Oswald was motivated by a conspiracy.
