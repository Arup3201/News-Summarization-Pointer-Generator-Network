Two brothers lost their trucks after driving their vehicles on to the thinning ice on Lake Winnebago.

The Wisconsin pair had just finished riding their motorcycles on the ice when Robert Lobajeski drove out in his truck to pick up cones.

His truck however fell through the ice, while his brother Brett's also went in as he tried to rescue the first vehicle.

The trucks were not far off the recommended driving paths, but the ice had been softened after temperatures hit the 50s on Sunday.

'We were finished riding for the day and I was out picking up the cones to get them back on the truck,' Robert told The Reporter Media.

'I just drove off the track and my truck sunk. I sat there stuck and I had him come out and to try and pull me out real quick. He just did a U-turn and his truck got stuck.'

The first truck became partially submerged with its plow and rear bumper above the water.

Brett's tires went through the ice about 100 feet away. His front end then sank under the water when crews tried to pull the truck out.

Brett managed to crawl 
through his truck window to escape. He said he does not expect the 
vehicle to run again. His brother eventually got out of the door on his vehicle.

The two were helped by snowmobilers and members of the Otter Street fishing club who were on the lake removing ramps.

'I wasn't scared at all,' Robert said.
