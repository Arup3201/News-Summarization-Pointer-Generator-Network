Shock: Schoolgirl Natasha Scott-Falber, 14, is believed to have died from septicemia

A talented teenager who had dreams of starring in the West End has died from suspected septicaemia aged just 14.

Natasha Scott-Falber, from Caerwent, South Wales, who was described as 'beautiful and full of life' by her family, was found by her father Mike Falber at his home on the morning of Valentine's Day.

Natasha had started to feel ill fours days earlier with what her family suspected was the norovirus, but her condition deteriorated and she died from what is thought to be septicemia.

Her mother Mandy Scott, brother 
Daniel Falber, 18, stepfather Mike Scott, and step-mother Linda Falber, 
and boyfriend Tom Steer, 18, are now coming to terms with the sudden 
death of the popular youngster who achieved many things during her short
life.

Ms Scott said: 
'Words cannot describe how we feel. As a family we will miss everything 
about Tash but we have so many wonderful memories and she will live on 
in our hearts forever.

'When we look back at all she's done, some people wouldn't fit that in a lifetime.

'In everything she did she gave 100 per cent and lived life to the full.'

'She was all-singing and all-dancing. The house was always full of singing. She wanted to be in the West End.

'Her
beautiful smile will be missed, her laughter, her singing, her 
enthusiasm, her joy of life.When Tash walked into a room, she lit it up.

'She always looked for the good in others and had time for everyone.'

Natasha Scott-Falber had fallen ill four days earlier with what her family believed was the norovirus

The Wyedean School pupil, who also acted and played the guitar, had been selected last year to perform in a backing choir for English tenor Alfie Boe at St David's Hall, Cardiff.

She was also a member of musical youth theatre company WAWWA, performing in shows at the likes of Newport's Dolman Theatre, and was a member of the Angel School of Dance, Chepstow, as well as Wyedean Gospel Choir and Wyedean Choir singing in concerts at home and abroad.

Natasha was also a committed Christian and was involved in St Stephen's and St Tathan's Church, Caerwent, and Chepstow Baptist Church and had helped to run Sunday School and holiday clubs at the churches.

More recently, she had been a member of St Luke's Church, Tutshill, Chepstow.

During her short lifetime Natasha had raised thousands of pounds for charities and aged 11 visited Uganda to help build houses for homeless children.

A post mortem examination is expected to be carried out today and funeral arrangements made after this.Â
