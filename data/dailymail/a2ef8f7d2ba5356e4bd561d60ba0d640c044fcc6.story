Troubled retailer Abercrombie & Fitch is in the headlines for all the wrong reasons again after a federal judge ruled that the trendy clothing retailer wrongly fired a Muslim worker who insisted on wearing a head scarf.

U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled in San Fransisco on Monday that the company had violated anti-discrimination laws when it fired Hani Khan, then 20, from its Hollister store in San Mateo, California, in 2010.

Already this year CEO Mike Jeffries has had to apologize for remarks he made in 2006 that the company did not market to ‘unattractive individuals,’ while last month A&F lost another legal dispute over claims that the design of its stores discriminated against disabled customers.

Hani Khan, right, has won her discrimination lawsuit against Abercrombie & Fitch, while CEO Mike Jeffries, left, has already had to apologize this year for his remarks that the company did not market to ‘unattractive individuals’

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit on Khan's behalf in 2011.

The company had claimed the head scarf violated its policy governing the look of its employees, which it said was part of its marketing strategy. The store argued that deviating from its look policy would affect sales.

Khan was employed for several months, in 2009 and 2010. She said that when she was hired, a manager at the store, in San Mateo's Hillsdale Mall, said it was OK for her to wear the hijab as long as it was in company colours.

But four months later she claims a district manager and human resources manager asked if she could remove the hijab while working. When she refused, she was suspended and then fired.

The case wasn't the first time the company has been charged with discriminating against Muslim women over the wearing of a hijab.

In 2009, Samantha Elauf, who was 17 at the time, filed a federal lawsuit in Tulsa, Oklahoma, alleging the company rejected her for a job because she was wearing a hijab.

Also in 2009 a London employment tribunal awarded 22-year-old Riam Dean £8,000 after she claimed the firm banished her to the stockroom because she had a prosthetic arm.

Abercrombie & Fitch has become well-known for its controversial 'look policy', which provides strict guidelines governing how employees dress. It stipulates staff must represent 'a natural classic American style'.

The company instructs employees on everything from how to wear their hair (clean and natural) to how long they should wear their nails (a quarter of an inch past the end of the finger).

But the policy has got them into trouble this year after a 2006 Salon Magazine interview with CEO, Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry.

The article highlighted Jeffries' statements that Abercrombie did not produce clothing for women larger than size 10 and purposefully did not market to 'unattractive' individuals.

'That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that,' Jeffries had said in the 2006 interview.

'In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.'

As the article gained momentum via 
Social Media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by 
comments and posts against the strategy.

Jeffries was forced to issued an official statement in May, 2013, denying that the company discriminated against people.

'I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense,' he said. 'We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics.’

Last month a federal judge ruled that A&F¿s surf-inspired clothing label Hollister has until January 1, 2017, to redesign hundreds of its storefronts to ensure that they are wheelchair-friendly

Then last month a federal judge ruled that A&F’s surf-inspired clothing label Hollister has until January 1, 2017, to redesign hundreds of its storefronts to ensure that they are wheelchair-friendly.

Many of Hollister's stores have entrances that resemble a stepped front porch and a lawsuit launched in 2009 accused the company of discriminating against disabled customers.

The long-running case originally grew from complaints filed against two Hollister stores in Colorado by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition.

Julie Farrar, 45, one of the plaintiffs in the four-year dispute, said she visited the Orchard Town Center store, which has since closed, to buy items for her 12-year-old daughter but her wheelchair couldn’t make it up the steps.

Lawyers for the Equal Rights Center, a national civil-rights organization, found similar access problems at Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister stores in nine States and filed a similar lawsuit in November 2009 in Maryland.

In 2012 the Colorado-focused case grew into a class-action suit targeting the 248 Hollister stores across the U.S. that feature imitation porch steps as a main entrance.

Despite the uproar, Hollister vigorously defended the use of stairs in its stores. 

Widespread: 248 Hollister stores across the U.S. currently feature faux porch steps as their main entrance

A company spokesman said that the raised entrances were designed to create 'an entry to a house in Southern California that you would walk up onto the porch or walk down into the porch, to enter, like you would do at a beach house.'

The firm argued that it complies with the law because the stores include side doors disguised as shuttered windows that are wheelchair accessible.

However plaintiffs said these doors are often are blocked with tables stacked with merchandise and they should not be made to enter through an 'inferior' entrance.

Ms Farrar, who was born without a sacrum - the triangular bone at the bottom of the spine - told The Colorado Independent: 'I would never go through a side door. It’s not something I would do. I’m philosophically opposed to that.

'These stores are designed to look shuttered and hidden, as if to keep out the riffraff. I want people to know that, as a society, we have evolved over the past 25 years.

'Despite the fact that [Hollister] market[s] beauty and athleticism as a stereotype, the reality is they still need the rest of us people who are short, chubby and maybe with acne and wheelchairs.'

In March U.S. District Judge Wiley Daniel agreed that Hollister’s inaccessible porches violate the American with Disabilities Act, also known as the ADA.

The 23-year-old law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodation, communications, and governmental activities.

A federal judge has ruled that Hani Khan she was sacked from her job at the Hollister in this California shopping center for wearing a hijab in 2010

Judge Daniel ruled that customers who use wheelchairs must be entitled to the same experience as all other customers. 

He suggested that Hollister could flatten out its entrance ways and remove the steps or install wheelchair-accessible ramps.

Commenting on the ruling, a spokesman for Hollister told MailOnline  'We are surprised by the Judge’s decision that the Hollister entrances are not compliant with the ADA.

'We’ve maintained throughout the litigation, and continue to maintain, that the stores comply with the ADA and allow access to all patrons.

'Beyond that, we want all of our customers to have a positive experience when shopping in our stores. While we reserve the right to appeal the underlying legal issue, we are currently working with the court and the plaintiffs to reach a mutually agreeable resolution.'

Hollister, like all of the Abercrombie brands, markets its clothing as a lifestyle, its main inspiration being Southern California's beach and surf scene. The website explains that it is the 'coolest destination for genuine SoCal style clothes for guys and girls.'

And a 2013 report to shareholders reads: 'It’s all about hot lifeguards and beautiful beaches… Young and fun, with a sense of humor, Hollister never takes itself too seriously. Hollister’s laid-back lifestyle and All-American image is timeless and effortlessly cool.'

The U.S. Justice Department has also weighed in on the discrimination case. It highlighted that the Hollister stores were built long after the ADA came into play and therefore the entrances violate both the 'spirit and letter of the law.'
