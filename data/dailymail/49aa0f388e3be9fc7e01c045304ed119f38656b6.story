Steven Gerrard will play alongside Chelsea captain John Terry and former Liverpool team-mates Xabi Alonso, Luis Suarez and Fernando Torres in a mouth-watering line-up at Anfield later this month.

The Reds captain, who will also team up with Arsenal legend Thierry Henry, is to feature in an all-star XI for a charity game organised by the Liverpool FC Foundation on March 29.

Gerrard will also manage the side with his former Liverpool team-mate and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher leading the opposition.

Gerrard and Carragher appeared in a relaxed mood as they faced the media at Anfield on Thursday  

The game gives Liverpool fans one last opportunity to see Gerrard in action alongside the best players from the array of sides he has captained throughout his time at Anfield before he leaves for LA Galaxy at the end of the season. 

A number of current Liverpool first-team players will also be involved.

Gerrard and Carragher took turns selecting from 22 star players with Reds stopper Brad Jones the surprise first name out of the hat. Gerrard revealed he was ‘staying loyal’ to his current team-mate.

The former England captain then selected the ‘best defender' he has 'ever played with' as Terry was picked to line-up at centre-half.

Fernando Torres, in action for Atletico Madrid, will play alongside Luis Suarez and Thierry Henry 

Luis Suarez will return to Anfield for the first time since his £75million summer switch to Barcelona 

Carragher claimed his fellow Sky Sports pundit and Arsenal legend Thierry Henry is 'excited' about the match 

Carragher responded by joking that the Chelsea captain, whose side were dumped out of the Champions League by Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night, ‘couldn’t run’.

Bayern Munich midfielder Alonso was hailed as a ‘top passer’ by Gerrard and was the 35-year-old's first pick in midfield. Suarez, the Barcelona striker deemed to be 'the man in form’ was selected to lead Gerrard’s attack. Carragher responded by picking Chelsea legend Didier Drogba to go head-to-head with club team-mate Terry.

Torres was then chosen by Gerrard to team up with Suarez and Henry was also selected by the Liverpool legend to form a tantalising three-pronged attack.

With the teams decided, Carragher accused Gerrard of ‘going for the egos', but claimed he had picked a 'proper team'.

'It's going to be a great occasion,' said Gerrard at a press conference on Thursday. 'When I made the phone calls and told them about playing in front of a full house, they loved the idea.

'Me and Jamie should not get any credit, it's credit to everyone who wants to come and help out. I know all those who are involved. They are winners and it will be a great game. 

'I am feeling good, looking forward to the future. I am staying respectful to Liverpool. I am fit and available and I want to be.'

Carragher added: 'Thierry Henry was more excited than I was when we spoke about it.'

Proceeds raised from the event will help fund Liverpool FC Foundation's community programmes, which benefit thousands of young people and adults throughout the city of Liverpool, and also support Alder Hey's new Hospital in the Park as well as providing support packages to Claire House, Positive Futures, Centre 56 and Cash for Kids.
