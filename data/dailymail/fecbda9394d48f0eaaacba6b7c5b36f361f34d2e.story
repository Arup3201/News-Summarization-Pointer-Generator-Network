Callous thieves were caught on CCTV snatching a collection tin in memory of a young man who died of an epilepsy-related condition.

Teaching assistant and sports coach Matt Boardman, 22, died in February of Sudden Unexpected Death In Epilepsy (SUDEP).

His father Paul arranged for the collection tin in a Bargain Booze shop in Blackburn, Lancashire - where Matt worked part-time - to raise funds for charity Epilepsy Bereaved.

Heartless: This woman, believed to be in her thirties and walking with a stick, was caught on CCTV stealing a collection tin in memory of Matt Boardman, 22, in a Blackburn branch of Bargain Booze

Accomplice: The woman was accompanied by a shaven-headed man, caught on film here, who distracted a shop assistant while she pounced

'Appalled': Paul Boardman, Matt's father, questioned how anyone could stoop so low as to steal a collection tin

But a dark-haired woman, aged about 30, can clearly be seen in video footage taking the tin from the shop counter, as a shaven-headed male accomplice waits in the background.

Paul, of Darwen in Lancashire, said he was 'appalled' somebody had stolen the donated cash.

'I am disgusted that somebody could stoop so low as to pinch this money,' he said.

'It isn't just any charity box, it is personal and means a lot to a lot of people.

'I hope they get caught. It is outrageous.

'It doesn't matter how much they took. Whether it was £1 or £1,000 - it is disgusting.'

CCTV recordings show the woman, who was wearing a blue fleece, black tracksuit pants and walked with a stick, entering the shop.

She was closely followed by a tall, forty-something man wearing a black jacket and shoulder bag.

While he asked the shop assistant about some wine, the woman, who had been circling the shop, grabbed the charity box and walked out.

She then ran away in the direction of Ewood, with the man following soon after without buying anything.

It is thought there was about £80 in the collection box.

A notice has now been placed on the counter, alongside a photograph of the thief.

It reads: 'A special thank you to the thief who stole the collection box that stood here.

'Hope you are proud of yourself.

'Apologies to all who had contributed to SUDEP, we do appreciate your help.'

Bargain Booze store manager Jane 
Wright said staff had been left devastated after the theft, which took 
place at 2.45pm on Sunday.

'Matt was a close friend to all the staff and knew a lot of our regular customers.

'It is infuriating and sickening that this could happen.'

Jane Hanna, director of Epilepsy Bereaved, said: 'I would plead to the people who have taken this money to turn themselves in to the police.

'If they don't, they are causing the family, who have suffered a terrible tragedy, even more pain.

'They are also taking away vital funds from Epilepsy Bereaved, which is working with bereaved families and researchers across the UK to prevent deaths.'

Matt, a keen Blackburn Rovers fan, was found in bed at 7pm on February 1 by his parents Paul and Diana Boardman when they went to wake him up to go and watch Blackburn play Newcastle United at Ewood Park.

His devastated family, including brothers Mikey, 20, and Niall, 11, were stunned at his death.

Matt was diagnosed with epilepsy aged 19, but despite being unable to drive because of the condition, he lived life to the full.

He was a fully qualified sports coach and worked as a teaching assistant at St Alban's primary school in Blackburn.

His girlfriend Rachael Gavin, 24, described him as 'the perfect person' and they had been together for 13 months.

Matt had sent her a text at 5.45pm on the day he died reading: 'Are you okay sweetheart?' because she had been feeling unwell. It was the last contact they had.

Mum Diana, 49, acting heads at St Alban's school, said: 'It is every parent's worst nightmare. It had just been a normal day, but when we went upstairs to see if he was ready for the game, he couldn't be woken.

'He was modest, loving, generous, brave, reliable and fun-loving. His last text to check if Rachael was okay says everything about him.

Police are investigating the theft of the collection tin and urge anyone with information to contact them on 101.
