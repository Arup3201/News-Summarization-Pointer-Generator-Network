Lonely bachelors looking for love often turn to dating websites in the search for a partner.

But Robert Darling has taken things that little bit further - by wandering the streets of New York for twelve years with a sandwich board asking women to marry him.

The unemployed 58-year-old - who admits he is a 'great conversationalist'  -  says he wants a wealthy lady to take care of him.

Desperate: Mr Darling wears his sign around his neck in the hope he can attract a wealthy lady to take care of him

The New Jersey,resident  spends two hours traveling to Manhattan twice a week on his quest for a soulmate.

His billboard declares he is open to offers and includes his phone number and email address.

Plagued with an unsuccessful love life for forty years, he resorted to extreme measures to find a suitor. 

Mr Darling said: 'I've never had any luck with the ladies and while this is going to extremes I'm confident I can find love this way.

Handsome: Mr Darling says he has been told by women that he is handsome and admits he is a 'great conversationalist' 

'I get a good reaction from most people, they think it's funny but I am really serious. 

'I'm looking for companionship, 
conversation, to go to museums and concerts - but I just don't have the 
resources to pay for that.

'So I need a wealthy lady to take care of me - I think I deserve it.'

Mr Darling said he has never had a serious relationship and his dating history is sparse.

'As far as a serious relationship, I've never had one,' he said. I've never been engaged, never proposed to anybody.'

Hopeful: Plagued with an unsuccessful love life for forty years, the 58-year-old has resorted to extreme measures to find a suitor

He takes his sign to upmarket areas of the city such as Wall Street, Columbus Circle and Times Square.

'There's a lot of money 
on Wall Street, maybe I'll meet a female Chief Executive Officer who 
will decide to become my wife,' he said.

'The sign will bring attention to me and my great smile will close the deal.'

Mr Darling has also searched dating websites like Craigslist but has never had any luck.

He often gets phone calls in response to his sign, but none are serious inquiries.

'A woman called me once and I thought it looked promising - but 
she actually wanted to hook me up with her friend who needed a green 
card to stay in the country.'

And his unusual suitor methods have also helped him cure social anxiety issues he was facing.

He said: 'I'm enjoying myself every time I go to New York - I'm very secure of myself and I think that's helped.'

But his unique approach gets mixed responses from people he meets.

Onlooker Joyce Brill, a tourist from Virginia, said: 'I would not call Robert, I would not go on a date with him - absolutely not.

'He's been doing this for so long and he and his sandwich board are kind of scruffy.'

However, LaSonda Stephenson from New Jersey was kinder with her verdict.

She said: 'I think it's pretty courageous - it's not something I would do, but I applaud him for not being shy about it.

'Everyone deserves a fair shot at love.'

But despite the wait, Mr Darling remains undeterred in his pursuit for true love.

He said: 'There's an incredible amount I have to offer - I'm intelligent, almost brilliant.

'I've heard I'm handsome once or twice, and I'm a great conversationalist. To Ms Right out there I would say, "Call my number or email me".

'We could talk and see if we're made for each other. It would be a great pleasure to see you if you're in New York City.

'Hopefully it will be a happy marriage. And he has no plans to hang up his sign any time soon.'

He said: 'Give up? Never! I'm just warming up. It's just a matter of time. I'm very patient and I know great success is just around the corner.'
