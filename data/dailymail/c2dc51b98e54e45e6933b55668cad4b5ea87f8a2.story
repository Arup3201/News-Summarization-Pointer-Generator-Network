Warnings that could have prevented a helicopter crash in central London which killed two people were ignored by aviation officials, according to a leaked report.

Pilot Pete Barnes, 50, was killed when his Agusta 109 helicopter clipped a high-rise crane on The Tower development, in Vauxhall, and smashed into a road during rush-hour.

Pedestrian Matthew Wood, 39, was also killed and 12 others were injured in the accident, which a report, due to be published later today, suggests could have been avoidable.

Warnings that could have prevented the crash which killed two were ignored, according to a leaked report

The helicopter's pilot Pete Barnes, 50, and pedestrian Matthew Wood, 39, were killed in the crash

A damning report by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB), leaked to the Daily Telegraph, shows that flight officials were warned in 2009 about the danger of the development on The Tower.

The operator of London Heliport warned the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that the building work meant helicopters flying low because of fog would breach rules saying they have to fly at least 500ft from structures.

According to the report, the warning 'does not appear to have led to further discussion or action'.

Capt Barnes was flying from Redhill Aerodrome, Surrey, to Elstree, Herefordshire, on the morning of January 16 last year to pick up restaurant tycoon Richard Caring. 

Mr Caring sent his pilot text messages and phoned him, saying weather conditions were too poor for the flight.

But Capt Barnes pressed on regardless, sending a text to Mr Caring which said: 'I'm coming anyway will land in a field if I have to.'

Twelve people were injured in the crash, which happened on January 16 last year at around 8am

The helicopter crashed into the crane, avoiding the skyscraper by 105ft and falling 700ft to the ground

After finding he could not land in Elstree,the pilot requested to land in Battersea.

The helicopter travelled at low altitude along the Thames and made a right turn towards The Tower in dense fog.

The report says Capt Barnes may not have seen the tower through the clouds, and also could have been distracted by changing radio frequencies.

The helicopter crashed into the crane, avoiding the skyscraper by 105ft and falling 700ft to the ground.

A number of vehicles on Wandsworth Road suffered heat damage or were damaged by wreckage. One car was completely consumed by fire. Buildings close to the crash were also damaged.

Workmen Richard Moule and Nicki Biagoni had lucky escapes as they were due to be on the crane that morning but were both late for work.

Since the accident the air traffic controller, Nats, has ruled that helicopters must not be instructed to fly at low altitudes over the south bank of the Thames.

'Any pilot routing along the south bank of the river and passing within 500ft vertically of the top of the crane, or the building once the crane is removed, would be in breach' of the rules, the AAIB said in its report.  

The CAA and Department for Transport declined to comment until the report is published.
