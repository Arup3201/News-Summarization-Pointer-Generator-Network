Right-to-die campaigner and primary progressive multiple sclerosis sufferer Debbie Purdy has died.

The 51-year-old, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, won a landmark ruling in the House of Lords in 2009 resulting in guidelines on assisted suicide being published by the Government.

She died in the Marie Curie Hospice in her home city, where she had been staying for a year, on December 23.

Her condition deteriorated significantly in 2013 and she ultimately rejected the option of travelling abroad to die. She was refusing food at the time of her death.

In a final interview she said her year-long hunger strike had been painful and difficult but described her life with progressive MS as ‘unacceptable’. 

A Dignity in Dying spokesman said she 'chose to hasten her death by stopping eating'.

He said: 'Towards the end of her life she wanted to control her death and refused food.

'It was a difficult and on-going process for her and it took a number of weeks for her life to end.' 

Ms Purdy had suffered with primary progressive multiple sclerosis for almost 20 years. 

She had been confined to a wheelchair since 2001 and recently she had been unable to move at all without help.

In 2009, she won a ruling to get clarification on whether her husband Omar Puente would be prosecuted if he helped her to end her life.

She wanted assurances that the Cuban-born violinist would not face prosecution if he accompanied her to the Swiss assisted dying clinic Dignitas. 

She was aware that she had divided public opinion but insisted it was still preferable to her debilitating form of MS, saying: ‘To disagree with me is to condemn me to 30 years of this.’ 

Mr Puente, a music teacher, today confirmed the death of his wife in a statement, paying tribute to 'a much loved wife, sister, aunt and friend'.

He told the BBC: 'We would like to thank the Marie Curie Hospice in Bradford for the care the staff gave her, which allowed her last year to be as peaceful and dignified as she wished.'

1995: Diagnosed with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis  at the age of 31.

2008: Began legal battle  by launching a High Court bid to force CPS to clarify what actions would lead to a friend or relative being charged under the 1961 Suicide Act.

2008: Lost battle and subsequent Court of Appeal case.

2009: Won legal victory when she forced the Department for Public Prosecutions to clarify assisted suicide circumstances, although the law remained unchanged.

2009: This led to 16 new guidelines on assisted suicide being which clarified what actions would lead to prosecution of those who helped a suicide.

2010: Told an inquiry that if she had not won she would have gone to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to end her life.

December 2013: Entered the Marie Curie hospice in Bradford. 

December 23, 2014: Died aged 51 after refusing food for weeks.

Campaign group Dignity in Dying expressed sadness over her death, describing her as a 'valued campaigner and friend'.

Chief executive Sarah Wootton said: 'Debbie wanted choice and control over her death should she consider her suffering unbearable.

'Ultimately she was seeking peace of mind that her wishes would be respected, but also crucially that her decisions would not result in the potential imprisonment of her husband.

'She rejected the option of travelling abroad to die, and instead, wanting to die in this country, chose to hasten her death by stopping eating.

'Debbie rallied against the hypocrisy of the current law, which turns a blind eye to people travelling abroad to die, whilst seeking to protect them by threatening the imprisonment of their loved ones after their death.

'For over a decade Debbie was a huge presence at Dignity in Dying; from stuffing envelopes to leading her legal challenge, she was an integral part of the campaign and a friend. We will miss her greatly.'

The group said her victory meant the law was changed so a loved one acting wholly on compassionate grounds and in an amateur capacity is unlikely to be prosecuted for helping a person with a clear and settled intention to die.

They said her legacy was one of 'greater clarity in the law and an increased awareness of the need for greater choice at the end of life'. 

Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted: 'Very sad to hear Debbie Purdy has died. She was a magnificent, tireless campaigner. RIP.' 

Former attorney general Lord Falconer, whose assisted dying bill is before Parliament, said: ‘Because of Debbie Purdy’s bravery in taking the matter to court when she was ill, people now look at the issue in a completely different way.’

Under the current law, helping someone to take their own life can carry a jail sentence of up to 14 years.

Lord Falconer’s bill proposes that doctors should be allowed to prescribe a lethal dose for terminally ill patients who have less than six months to live. 

An alliance of 80 prominent figures including former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey has called on politicians to debate assisted dying legalisation, saying it would be ‘heartless’ to refuse.

Some campaigners have said the proposals do not go far enough as they would not help those like Miss Purdy who have long-term conditions.

Critics have voiced fears that the elderly and vulnerable could be put under intolerable pressure to agree to end their lives.

Teacher turned campaigner whose terminal illness plunged her into High Court battle to change law

Ms Purdy was one of Britain's most outspoken activists in the legal battle over assisted suicide

Debbie Purdy was diagnosed with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis in 1995 at the age of 31.

She began her legal battle in 2008 by launching a High Court bid to force the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to clarify exactly what actions would lead to a friend or relative being charged under the 1961 Suicide Act.

Despite losing the battle and then losing a subsequent Court of Appeal case, she won a legal victory in 2009 when she forced the Department for Public Prosecutions to clarify assisted suicide circumstances, although the law remained unchanged.  

Ms Purdy's legal victory led to 16 new guidelines on assisted suicide being issued by Keir Starmer QC, the then director of public prosecutions, which clarified what actions would lead to prosecution of those who helped a suicide.

He said the motives of those assisting suicide would be at the centre of the decision over whether they should be prosecuted.

In 2010 she told an inquiry on assisted dying that if she had not won the backing of the Law Lords she would have gone to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to end her own life as her condition was deteriorating.

She had argued that it would be a breach of her human rights if she did not know whether her husband would be prosecuted if he travelled with her to the Swiss clinic.

The BBC reports that in December 2013 Ms Purdy entered the Marie Curie hospice in Bradford and decided to try to end her life by refusing food, but the hospice continued to offer it to her.

In her final interview with BBC Look North, Ms Purdy said her life was 'unacceptable'.

She said: 'It's painful and it's uncomfortable and it's frightening and it's not how I want to live.

'The choice that I make is to die, maybe it's not the choice other people would make, but it's my choice.'

In her blog on the Dignity in Dying website, Ms Purdy wrote: ‘I love my life, but I have always been a fiercely independent woman, and I want to have choice about how and when I die. 

'Should living become unbearable to me, I want to be able to ask for, and receive help to die with dignity.

'British law does not allow this, and makes assisting someone to die a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison, so my options are to attempt suicide myself, and risk making matters worse, or to travel to Switzerland to have an assisted death.

'My husband knows that if he was able to help me collect the necessary paperwork and make travel arrangements, I could delay making this decision, maybe forever, and for this reason he is prepared to risk a prison sentence. 

'But I do not want Omar or any other person dear to me to be made a criminal for what I see as an act of love and humanity.’
