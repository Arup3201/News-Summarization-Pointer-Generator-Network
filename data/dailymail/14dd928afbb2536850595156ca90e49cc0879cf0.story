Victoria Cross hero Sergeant Johnson Beharry and his new bride Mallissa revealed they are expecting their first child

Victoria Cross hero Sgt Johnson Beharry is seen with his new bride Mallissa and reveals they are expecting their first child.

The couple tied the knot at London's Old Marylebone Hotel in front of family and friends, before moving on to a later blessing.

The pair - who only met in October - are seen in their wedding finery in pictures published by Hello! magazine.

And former Dancing On Ice star Beharry tells the mag that he and his dentist wife Venice Mallissa Noel, who is known as Mallissa, already have a family on the way.

The Grenada-born soldier said: ‘It's a little sooner than planned, but we are over the moon.

‘Mallissa and I felt strongly that it was important to marry before our baby arrives.

'I didn't grow up with a mum and dad who were together and all my life I've said I don't want my child to say the same and that I want them to know they've got that solid foundation.’

The couple had their second ceremony at the Gardens Hotel in Bloomsbury'

Invited guests included Johnson's partner on the 2011 series of the ice-dancing show Jodeyne Higgins.

Beharry was the first VC recipient in more than 30 years, for two acts of bravery.

In the first he led a patrol to safety after being ambushed and under heavy fire, and in the other he saved the lives of several colleagues despite suffering brain and facial injuries from a grenade.

He split from first wife Lynthia in 2005, as a result of the traumatic experiences he endured.

Speaking about the ceremony, he said: ‘I was shaking waiting for Mallissa but when I saw her I felt calmer,’ he said.

‘I tried to make her laugh, more to ease my nerves than anything, but she wasn't having it.

‘When I saw her, my expression stayed composed, but inside my heart was swelling with love and pride. She looked beautiful.’

Their reception included a performance from the Military Wives Choir during a bash in the Senate House at University College 
London and letters of congratulations were read out including one from the Queen and one from the Prince of Wales.

Beharry said of their whirlwind romance: ‘From the moment I met Mallissa, I didn't want to be apart from her.

‘It's like we've known each other forever and I'm excited about this new chapter in our lives. We have so much to celebrate.’

The couple got married in the Blue Room at the registry office which holds up to 30 guests.

Speaking after the wedding, Michael Noel, Mallissa's brother, said: 'It's a happy day.'

Mr Noel said guests had travelled from Grenada and Miami to be with the couple on their big day.
