City analyst: David Reynolds (pictured), 30, allegedly drunkenly threw a punch at Araz Draey when he was thrown out of the Berkeley Hotel in central London

A high-flying City analyst broke a bouncer's nose when he was booted out of a five-star hotel after a row over his bar bill, a court heard today.

David Reynolds, 30, allegedly drunkenly threw a punch at Araz Draey when he was thrown out of the Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge, central London, after hurling a torrent of abuse at bar staff when his credit card was declined.

He accused a waitress at the plush £570-a-night hotel of being rude and became abusive himself when Mr Draey stepped in to defuse the row, Westminster Magistrates Court was told.

'Mr Reynolds was drunk and abusive towards staff, prompting security to be called', Izolda Gribbin, prosecuting, said.

'He was taken to the pavement outside the hotel, when the victim at the time had his hand behind his back and was talking to Mr Reynolds. For no apparent reason, Mr Reynolds punched the complainant on the nose. He was subsequently restrained prior to police being called.'

Mr Draey was left bloodied and bruised following the incident on December 18 last year and is said to have suffered a broken nose.

Reynolds admitted drinking in the bar that night but said the contact with Mr Draey's nose was accidental in a struggle outside.

'He had been drinking in the bar of the hotel with another male at the time of the offence', Ms Gribbin said. 'When he attempted to pay, his card was declined.'

The card was eventually accepted, but Reynolds was said to be angry at his treatment at the hands of the waitress which continued after he had been ejected.

Reynolds is also contesting the fact that Mr Draey's nose was broken in the incident.

'Initially it appeared the injury sustained was a cut to the nose and bleeding, but the complainant now says there was actually a fracture to the nose', Ms Gribbin said.

Reynolds, wearing a grey suit and dark blue tie, pleaded not guilty to one count of assault by beating. He will stand trial in front of magistrates in May.

Reynolds was granted unconditional bail and hid his face with a folder as he left the court building.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
