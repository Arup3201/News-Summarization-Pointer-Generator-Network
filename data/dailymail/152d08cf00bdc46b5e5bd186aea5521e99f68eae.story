It is more than five months since George Groves left Wembley Stadium having been knocked out by Carl Froch.

The Londoner had been felled by his bitter rival, who landed a huge punch to fell Groves, and left the ring that night devastated having lost to Froch for the second time.

Many wrote the 26-year-old's career off there and then - but much has happened in those intervening months to revitalise the Brit's career, including an extremely impressive victory over Christopher Rebrasse.

Not only did that win ensure Groves became European super-middleweight champion, it also elevated him to  mandatory challenger for the Anthony Dirrell's WBC world title.

And that prize, a reinvigorated Groves insists, will soon be around his waist.

'It's an inevitability that I will be world champion - it will happen,' he told Sportsmail while promoting the launch of the new Far Cry 4 game, due to be released on November 18.

'I want to achieve the dream I have held since I was a child and I will, no doubt about it at all.

'We'll plough on through this next fight and then the dream could become a reality sooner than many ever thought it might.'

And that next bout is only a week away, with American Denis Douglin facing Groves at Liverpool's Echo Arena on November 22.

Groves is extremely confident for the fight, though not complacent, and is adamant he will get the second rematch with Froch he so craves if - or more important in his words 'when' - he keeps on winning.

'I'm in great shape and I just can't wait to get out there so we can strut our stuff,' he added. 'Douglin's a southpaw and I have never been defeated by a southpaw so the confidence is flowing.

'After the loss to Froch last time it felt like life or death - as boxing does at times - but I've come back well and he is back on my radar.

'I would love a Froch III to happen and I think I would beat him.

'He is being indecisive about the whole thing, delaying who he will fight next, and we all know he doesn't like me.

'If I win a world title fight, which I know is going to happen, then I am almost certain, almost certain, that a third bout will happen.'

But Froch is not the only potential future British opponent being touted for Groves, with James DeGale smarting for a chance to avenge his solitary defeat back in May 2011.

Groves is coy about the possibility of an alternative British superfight but admits it is not totally outside the realms of possibility.

He continued: 'If we both keep winning then our paths will cross again, that much is clear. I'm not thinking about him right now but he may come around again as a potential opponent in the future.

'If he wins a world title, and when I win my world title, then a huge unification fight could happen.

'We both have big personalities and there is an atmosphere between us as everyone know, so there would be nothing bigger than if we had a unification fight in the future.'

Talk of British superfights are for the future, however, and Groves is concentrating on the present.

Douglin is up next, with Dirrell to follow, and Groves is adamant he will improve on his current record of: 22 fights, 20 wins, two losses (both to Froch).

'I'm ready for the fight, and to be honest ready for the next one, but I will concentrate on winning in Liverpool first.

'The hard work is already banked so the next couple of weeks are slightly frustrating as it is all about having time to chill and having more time to myself.

'We always mean business and that means I intend for there to be a stoppage against Douglin. I won't go gung ho, it will be controlled, but I intend to knock him out.'

And, if he does, Groves will be well along the road to finally achieving his dream.
