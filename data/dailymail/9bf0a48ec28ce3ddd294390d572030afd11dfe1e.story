The parents of a six-year-old boy who was dragged 160ft down a hallway by his teacher say they are shocked that she is back teaching.

Ashley Silas, 30, was caught on surveillance camera pulling the first-grader across the floor at Brooks Elementary School in Bullitt County, Kentucky on October 29 last year.

She was fired immediately but has since won an appeal over the decision. The district has assigned her to a long term substitute role at Bullitt Lick Middle School for $48,128 a year.

'I get a sick feeling in my stomach,' the boy's father told WAVE3 as he recalled the video.

Caught on camera: Teacher Ashley Silas drags a six-year-old boy through the hallways at Brooks Elementary School in Kentucky in October for being disruptive. Silas has now returned to the classroom

Stubborn: At one point the teacher stops - but only to get a better grip on the first-grader's wrist

Shocking: The boy was dragged through the hallway in front of other children, the video shows

The man, who did not wish to be identified, pointed out that Silas dragged his son from the classroom and stopped at one point - but only to firm up her grip on the boy's arm.

As she drags the boy along, she repeatedly looks at her cell phone, which is in her other hand.  

When Silas appealed her termination, she said she dragged the boy from the classroom because he was being disruptive and threatening another student and would not walk to the principal's office.

Silas, herself a mother to a baby daughter, insisted that she was not hurting the boy and that the youngster actually enjoying being center of attention - which he denied when speaking to WAVE3.

His parents added that he has ADHD but is unable to take medication because he suffers from side effects. They say they are working with the school to improve his behavior. 

'Cruel': She continues dragging the boy to the elementary school's office - while checking her cell phone

When she was fired on November 7, Bullitt County Schools Superintendent Keith Davis said she had failed 'to take reasonable measures to protect the health, safety and well-being of students' or 'to refrain from subjecting students to embarrassment or disparagement'. 

After her appeal, the three-member tribunal concluded in December that although her conduct was 'shocking and offensive to virtually everyone', she did not deserve to lose her job.

'(I)t does appear (the first-grader) was not harmed and did in fact enjoy sliding through the hall and being the center of attention,' the panel wrote.

She was instead given a seven week suspension without pay and has returned to work.

Eric Farris, the attorney for the district, said they had not wanted to hire her again but the tribunal appeals system left them no choice, WAVE reported.. 

Back at work: Silas, pictured with her daughter, has now started a job working for a nearby middle school

Anger: The boy's family, who did not wish to be identified, said they cannot believe a tribunal overturned the teacher's termination. Despite her claims, they say their son did not enjoy the experience

'You're dragging a child 160 feet by his wrist, past his peers and other teachers and a parent, who is in the office,' Farris said. 'I mean in what world is that OK?'

He said district officials have not yet decided if they will appeal the Silas case.

An attorney for Silas said she accepted the tribunal's decision and was glad to be continuing her work for the school district. 

Hillview Police are conducting their own investigation and the county attorney will later decide if criminal charges should be brought against Silas.
