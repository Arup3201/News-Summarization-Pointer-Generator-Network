An Iowa family has won thousands of ribbons for their culinary skills at the Iowa State Fair - and they hope to win more this year.

The Des Moines Register reported that 53-year-old Robin Tarbell-Thomas is competing on Thursday.

'Robin has a certain artistry in her cookies,' Arlette Hollister, the State Fair's food superintendent, told the newspaper. 'You know which ones are hers just by looking at them. I see people try to copy her.

'That's a big thing, to beat Robin Tarbell.'

Robin has already won over 3,000 ribbons from the State Fair, and her mother Olive Jean Tarbell, 83, has over 2,000, the newspaper said. The two women were used by Gedney and Crisco, respectively, for publicity purposes.

Along with Robin's 21-year-old daughter Molly Thomas, the three Tarbell women won 500 State Fair ribbons from 2010 to 2013, according to The Des Moines Register.

State Fair marketing director Lori Chappell told the newspaper 'There's really no way to confirm they have won the most, but we think that is the case.'

The Tarbell family's history of wins goes back five generations.

Robin's great-grandmother Eva Horstman won the first of the Tarbell family's ribbons for a cake at the Moulton Jamboree - before her grandmother Mildred Phillips entered various contests, the newspaper reported.

Mildred won 5,000 ribbons, and youngest competitor Molly 'has gathered hundreds of her own ribbons' from the State Fair, The Des Moines Register said.

'Some people think we're nuts,' Olive told the paper.Â
