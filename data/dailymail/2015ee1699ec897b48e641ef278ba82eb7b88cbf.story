Allen Lambert, 65, used banned pesticides to kill ten buzzards and a sparrowhawk at the Stody estate near Holt, Norfolk, to protect its pheasants

A judge yesterday warned the rural aristocracy that they must take responsibility for the actions of their employees after a gamekeeper was spared jail for poisoning birds of prey.

Allen Lambert, 65, used banned pesticides to kill ten buzzards and a sparrowhawk at the Stody estate near Holt in Norfolk to protect its pheasants.

He claimed to have found the bodies in the 4,500-acre grounds and that he was being ‘set up’ by a local men with a grudge against him. 

But the explanation was dismissed as a ‘fairy story’ by the prosecution and he was found guilty of charges including killing the birds and possessing banned pesticides following a trial at Norwich Magistrates Court last month. 

The RSPB has described it as ‘the worst case of bird poisoning’ ever detected in England.

Lambert faced up to six months behind bars and a £5,000 fine for the death of each bird between October 2012 and April last year but was given a ten-week suspended sentence. 

Sentencing Lambert at Norwich Magistrates’ Court, district judge Peter Veits said: ‘The only motivation I can see for this is to protect the birds the estate breeds for its shoot.

‘Those who employ gamekeepers have a strict duty to know what is being done in their name and on their property.’ 

Lambert had worked on the estate for 24 years and was originally employed by Ian MacNicol, who was president of the Country Land and Business Association from 1997 to 1999.

The father-of-four died in 2006 and his family still own the estate.

Lambert was caught after a member of public found the decomposing bodies of four buzzards and contacted police.

John Hughes, defending, said his client had been verbally promised a home for life in the grounds but had been ordered to leave as a result of his arrest.

Lambert was given a ten-week jail sentence suspended for a year. He was found guilty of charges including killing the birds and possessing banned pesticides. He admitted inappropriately storing a rifle. 

Lambert, who retired around the same time, refused to comment yesterday. The estate also declined to discuss the case. 

Detective Constable Richard Moden, of Norfolk Police, said: ‘Lambert has shown a total disregard for the laws surround the protection of wildlife.’
