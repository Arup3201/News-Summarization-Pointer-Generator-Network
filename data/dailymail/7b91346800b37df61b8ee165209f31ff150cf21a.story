This is the moment a woman 'promises to God' that a $100 bill is hers after pranksters plant it by her feet.

Secret video footage shows the  feisty claimant sitting inside a department store before a trickster picks up the positioned dollar note from the floor.

She then puts on a convincing act as she states the money must have fallen from her purse.

'I wouldn't lie. I just put it in my purse. I promise to God,' the woman says in an American accent as she's asked if the bill is hers. 

She is told to double-check her bag to see if the cash is still there.

After a brief rummage around, she concludes that the money is indeed hers. 

'It's not. It was right here with my phone, I promise to God baby. 

'I was sitting right here, it is my $100,' the lady chimes.
