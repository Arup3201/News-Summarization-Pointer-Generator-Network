Wages under the coalition will have fallen more sharply than under any government since Victorian times, Labour claimed today.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls used a major speech on the economy to warn after inflation are down by 2.3 per cent, the worst fall since Benjamin Disraeli was Prime Minister.

Mr Balls echoed Ronald Reagan's campaign to be US President when he asked voters if they were better off than four years ago, as he warned interest rates could rise early because the coalition has failed to build enough homes.

Analysis by the House of Commons Library  shows wages are expected to fall by 2.3 per cent during this Parliament, the lowest since 1874-80

Mr Balls's speech in Bedford is the latest stage in a Labour summer offensive to seize control of the political agenda with less than a year until the general election.

He pointed to analysis by the House of Commons Library which shows that by 2015 'working people will have seen the biggest fall in wages of any Parliament since 1874'.

The forecast of a 2.3 per cent fall in real earnings between 2010 and 2015 will be the first time incomes have been lower than when a government came to office since the 1920s 

Mr Balls said it means average wages after inflation are down by more than £1,600 a year since 2010.

He claimed David Cameron will try to cut the top rate of tax again – from 45p to 40p for those earning over £150,000 if the Tories win next year’s election.

Mr Balls told an audience in Bedford: ‘While David Cameron and George Osborne complacently claim the economy is now fixed, the truth is most people are worse off under the Tories.

‘For working people, average wages after inflation are down by over £1,600 a year since 2010.

‘By 2015 working people will have seen the biggest fall in wages of any Parliament since 1874.

'It’s also set to be the first time since the 1920s that people are worse off at the end of the Parliament than they were at the beginning.

‘From a Conservative-led Government that promised to make working people better off back in 2010, this is a dismal record of failure.’

In 1981 Ronald Reagan asked US voters if they were better off

British politicians often look across the Atlantic for inspiration.

Labour is mimicking another politician from the US: Ronald Reagan.

In the 1980 US election campaign  Reagan attacked Jimmy Carter, asking voters: ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago?’

Labour has made clear it plans to pose the same question to voters in 2015.

In his party conference speech last year, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'In 2015 you'll be asking: am I better off now than I was five years ago and we already know the answer for millions of families will be no.'

Labour-commissioned research shows that over the five years to 2015 average earnings are expected to have declined by 2.3 per cent.

That will be the biggest fall since 1874-80, when average earnings fell 2.6 per cent.

At that time, Britain was suffering in the ‘Long Depression’, which, like the most recent recession, was sparked by trouble in the financial sector, the ‘Panic’ of 1873.

Mr Balls said: ‘Working people can’t afford five more years of the same old Tory economics. We know the Tories’ real economic plan - it’s to cut taxes at the top and hope that wealth will just trickle down.'

The Bank of England has suggested interest rates will rise before the election, with house prices soaring by 10 per cent year-on-year. 

But Mr Balls said the hike in mortgage bills was the fault of the government. 'Already today, even before living standards have stopped falling, this government's failure to get more houses built means there is now a real risk that interest rates will rise prematurely to rein in an unbalanced housing market.'

He went on: ‘Having already cut taxes for millionaires in this Parliament, they’re champing at the bit to do it again if they win the election - cutting the top rate of tax for people earning over £150,000 again from 45p to 40p. Another tax cut worth £3 billion for the richest one per cent of our country.

‘We know George Osborne wanted to cut it down to 40p in his omnishambles Budget two years ago. David Cameron won’t rule out doing it. And Boris Johnson and the right are now demanding it.

‘This is the real Tory agenda for a second term. The same old Tories standing up for the few, while everyone else is left behind. And it shows just how much is at stake next year.'

And he will claim Labour will make ‘long term changes to create an economy that works for all working people, not just a few’. It will be based on ‘big reform, not big spending’, he said. 

But Treasury minister Priti Patel said: ‘Ed Balls’ speech would mean £17 billion more spending, but he has only found £105 million to pay for it. It’s just more of the same from Labour

But Treasury minister Priti Patel said: ‘Ed Balls’ speech would mean £17 billion more spending, but he has only found £105 million to pay for it. It’s just more of the same from Labour.

‘Labour spent and borrowed their way through the good times and left us with the biggest deficit in our peacetime history.

That’s why we’ve been working through our long-term economic plan to build a healthier economy. Thanks to the hard work of the British people, the deficit is coming down, there are more people in work than ever before and Britain is set to be the fastest growing economy of any major advanced country.

‘The real choice Britain will face next May is between a long-term economic plan that is supporting hardworking taxpayers, or a Labour Party that hasn’t learned its lesson and would add more debt than future generations can ever pay.’
