The financial watchdog has been accused of committing an ‘extraordinary blunder’ by releasing market-sensitive information about an insurance inquiry which sent the stock market plummeting.

Around £7billion was wiped off the value of insurers at one point on Friday after Clive Adamson, from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), revealed that 30million pensions and savings policies were due to be investigated.

The watchdog rushed to reassure panicked investors about the inquiry into rip-off charges and sub-standard service, but despite their efforts to calm the market the industry ended up suffering a total fall in value of around £2.4billion.

MP Andrew Tyrie, the Treasury committee chairman, said the FCA had breached the principle that information should be released to all parties concerned at the same time, adding: ‘On the face of it, this is an extraordinary blunder.

‘This announcement may have led to a disorderly market in shares. It may also have damaged consumer confidence in the industry as a whole.’

The Daily Telegraph reported on Friday
 that the FCA was planning to investigate financial policies worth 
£150billion, sold between the 1970s and the turn of the millennium.

The
 inquiry, which is due to start in the summer, will attempt to discover 
whether loyal customers who took out products such as private pensions, 
endowments, investment bonds and life insurance over a 30-year period 
are locked in with high exit penalties.

The announcement was a fresh blow for 
the industry after the Chancellor gave pensioners the freedom to draw 
down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, removing 
the need to buy an annuity.

Proposal: Pensions Minister Steve Webb promised a 'full-frontal assault' last week on pension schemes which give poor value

George Osborne’s radical pension reforms have been criticised by the former head of the Pensions Commission and the Financial Services Authority.

From April 2015, all restrictions on access to a retirees’ pension pot will be removed.

But Lord Adair Turner has claimed that the changes risk leaving millions of pensioners close to poverty in later life.

He warned: ‘There’s a danger that people don’t realise how low the state pension is.

‘Many pensioners could even use their pots to invest in buy-to-let properties which could stoke future house price bubbles.’

And last week Pensions Minister Steve Webb promised a ‘full-frontal assault’ on pension schemes which give poor value, announcing that a 0.75 per cent cap will be imposed on charges from April next year.

Mr Tyrie has now called for the investigation into the FCA’s release of information to be led by an independent figure and for any resulting report to be published in full.

He said: ‘It is crucial that we have a full and transparent explanation about how such an apparently serious mistake came to be made by our financial services watchdog – the body appointed by Parliament to enforce high standards of conduct.

‘Responsibility for the FCA’s work on this should lie not with the board as a whole but with the independent directors alone, led by the chairman.

This is an early test of their essential role in exercising oversight of the executives and ensuring that they meet the same high standards expected of the industry.’

The FCA declined to comment.
