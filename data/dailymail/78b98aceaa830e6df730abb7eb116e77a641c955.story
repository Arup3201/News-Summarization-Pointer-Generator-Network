Ashley Cole became the 11th Englishman to play for a foreign club in the Champions League when he was named in Roma's starting XI, following in some illustrious (and rather bizarre) footsteps.

The likes of Steve McManaman and Owen Hargreaves have won the competition with European sides, while David Beckham had a high-profile stint at Real Madrid.

We defy anyone, however, to remember Scott Minto and Michael Thomas turning out for Benfica against HJK Helsinki in 1998.

Here, Sportsmail looks at those 10 previous Englishmen abroad...

Steve McManaman (Real Madrid)

Converted from a tricky winger to a workhorse midfielder in Madrid, McManaman won the Champions League twice with Real, in 2000 and 2002.

His finest moment came in the 2000 final against Valencia, when he scored a spectacular scissors-style volley in a 3-0 victory for Real.

Owen Hargreaves (Bayern Munich) 

OK, OK, Hargreaves was born in Canada but by the time he won the tournament with Bayern in 2001 he had already played for England Under 21s, which is good enough for him to make it on this list.

He was part of one of Bayern's many dominant sides and forced himself into the full England team. He would later win the Champions League again with Manchester United.

David Beckham (Real Madrid)

The most famous footballer on the planet when he moved to Madrid, Beckham did not actually have much success at the Bernabeu.

He won La Liga in his final season but the Galacticos, of which he was part, did not reach the Champions League semi-finals while he was there - a poor return for a team with such talent.

Michael Owen (Real Madrid)

The striker had a solitary season at the Bernabeu in 2004-05, during which he was frequently used as a substitute.

He scored his first Real goal in the Champions League, against Dynamo Kiev, but that was the only time he netted in Europe that season as Los Blancos failed to get past the last 16.

Jonathan Woodgate (Real Madrid)

One of Real's more bizarre signings, Woodgate was hampered by injury (he did not play at all during his first season) and famously scored an own goal then was sent off on his debut.

He did have a little more success in Europe and scored his only Madrid goal in the Champions League, against Rosenborg.

Joe Cole (Lille)

This loan move in 2011-12 was meant to revive Cole's career but it did not quite succeed. He was overshadowed at the then-French champions by Eden Hazard and had limited impact in Europe.

He played six times for Lille in the Champions League but did not score as the club finished bottom of their group.

Scott Minto, Brian Deane and Michael Thomas (Benfica)

It's impossible not to lump these three in together as they all moved to Portugal at around the same time.

Deane and Thomas were signed by Graeme Souness, while left back Minto joined the Portuguese giants under the previous boss Mario Wilson.

None of the trio made much impact in the Champions League. Deane scored in the first round against Beitar Jerusalem but Benfica did not make it beyond the group stage and Minto and Thomas both played in a humbling 2-0 defeat by HJK Helsinki.

Matt Derbyshire (Olympiacos)

Possibly the most bizarre addition on this list, seeing as he has never managed to hold down a regular starting spot in any Premier League team, never mind one in the Champions League.

But with his move to Olympiacos in 2009, he was given the opportunity to play in Europe's elite competition. He had domestic success in Greece but less on the continent, and was sent off against Bordeaux in 2010. He is now at Rotherham

Matt Derbyshire went from a peripheral figure at Blackburn to playing in Europe for Olympiacos
