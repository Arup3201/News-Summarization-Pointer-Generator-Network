For Fiona Bruce it was an Antiques Roadshow moment that brought a host of teenage memories flooding back.

When a visitor to the Roadshow appeared with a copy of the very first Jackie from 1964, the BBC newsreader revealed her personal connection to the girls’ magazine as one of its models.

Miss Bruce said: ‘I used to be in it – in the strips known as Photo Love. They were stories about girls and boys and romance and I’d have a speech bubble coming out my mouth saying things like “Does he really love me?”

‘Ah, it was a great gig, I remember, because I got my friends involved.

‘I needed boys to be in it with me, so I used to pick those that I fancied from the boys’ school – and then I got to kiss them.’ Miss Bruce began featuring in Jackie in 1980.

She said she secured the job, advertised in a newsagent’s window, after her mother told her ‘to get off my backside’. It paid £3 an hour – ‘riches in those days’.

And she would choose the best looking boys at school to pose with her-even though she had to bend at the knees to kiss them because she was taller.

Ms Bruce, now 49 and a mother of two, says she spotted an advert for the Jackie job in a newsagent's window.

She was accepted for the magazine's Photo Love feature-but only after he mother had worried that the photographer might be 'a bit dodgy' and had invited him tot he family home for approval.

In one typical Photo Love strip, pictured above, her character, Lorna, is torn between two boys – shy Eddie and the more outgoing Pete – before choosing the latter.

Miss Bruce will reminisce about her schoolgirl days on tomorrow night’s edition of the Roadshow.

Charity fundraiser Martin Cook took the magazine along to the Roadshow when it visited Newstead Abbey, in Nottinghamshire. It was valued at up to £300 and he plans to sell it to raise money for the Treetops Hospice, in Risley, Derbyshire.

Jackie – labelled ‘a girl’s best friend’ – ran from January 11, 1964 until folding in 1993.
