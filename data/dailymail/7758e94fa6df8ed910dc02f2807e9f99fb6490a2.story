Amanda Knox has joined Twitter and says she’s accepted Meredith Kercher's family thinks she's guilty as the end of her murder retrial approaches.

Knox tweeted a link to her blog: ‘With Respect to the Kercher Family’ on December 18, in which she writes:  'I hope that everyone can understand that this is an issue of perspective, and from mine and those who know my innocence, it’s clear that my actions are an attempt to show compassion and solidarity.

'I have to accept that the Kerchers believe I’m guilty and my attempts to honor her memory can cause them pain. I do not wish to antagonize their grief, even with my best intentions.'

Moving on: Knox, 26, said that 'common sense' told her not to return to Italy for her trial in the murder of British student Meredith Kercher

The 26-year-old is currently being retried for Meredith’s murder in Florence, Italy, but is not attending the trial.

It appears her outburst was triggered by being told to remove a link to the Kercher family fundraising page from her website www.amandaknox.com.

The blog entry goes on to describe her pain at being asked to remove the link by the family’s lawyer.She writes: “It is with a broken heart that I acquiesce with the Kercher family’s attorney’s request to remove from my site the link to the Kercher family’s fundraising page and the page I have dedicated in memory of my friend, Meredith.

'I feel trapped in a position where any attempts I make to respect their grief from a distance are perceived as indifference, and any attempts to make a connection are perceived as antagonism and arrogance.

'Thank you to all who have supported me in wanting to keep Meredith’s memory as a friend alive in my heart.'

Retried: In the midst of her retrial in Italy, Amanda Knox has launched a Twitter page

In closing arguments last week the Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca urged the panel of two professional judges and eight lay jurors to disregard Knox's claims of innocence.

He said: 'She has become a well-known person. You know she signed contracts for millions of dollars for her book. She has someone who takes care of her public relations.

'She has a personal website where she invites people to collect donations in the memory of the victim, Meredith Kercher, which is an unbearable contradiction for the family.'

He added that the world's attention has focused on Knox, while 'the victim has fallen into total oblivion, to the immense pain of the Kercher family'.

Amanda had previously hit back at Maresca's claims as inaccurate.

On December 17, she tweeted: ‘Support
 Meredith Kercher’s family,’ and a link to another blog entry in which 
she wrote: 'The Kercher family’s civil attorney, Francesco Maresca, in 
his closing arguments yesterday, claimed I have been collecting 
unspecified funds in the name of Meredith and her family.He implied that
 I was deceiving the public and collecting those funds for myself.

'Please
 visit the Meredith Kercher Murder page and scroll down to the Donation 
section to discover that I have simply added a link to the Kercher 
family’s own website where they solicit donations for their ongoing 
struggle through this heartbreaking legal process.

'I
 have been solicited by Mr Maresca to remove from my site anything I 
have done to honor her memory or show support to her family. My response
 was that no one but the Kercher family has any right to make such a 
request. As I await direct contact from the family of my murdered 
friend, I will continue to honor her and show support. Thank you for your support.'

Knox returned home to Seattle on October 4, 2011, after four years in jail for the murder of Meredith Kercher

Knox has a section of her website called: ‘Meredith Kercher Murder’, but there is no longer a ‘Donation Section’, so it appears she has now removed it.

However - in a move that some may find distasteful - next to Knox’s blog entries about Meredith is an icon with credit card symbols in which she asks for donations for her own Knox Defense Fund.

Knox joined Twitter on November 14 as @amamaknox, tweeting: '#RyanFergusonWelcome home!!! With love and support, Amanda and Madison.' She also posted a photo of herself with best friend Madison Pax, who moved to Italy to support her when she was in prison, holding up a sign saying ‘Welcome home Ryan.'

Ryan Ferguson spent 10 years in prison wrongly convicted of second-degree murder and first degree robbery and was released last month after it was finally overturned.

Knox has only tweeted 14 times and at the time of writing had just 97 followers – one of which is her co-accused Raffaele Sollecito who has been on Twitter for since November 2011.

On her Twitter page she also has the Latin quote: 'Aequam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem,' a quote from ancient Roman poet Virgil meaning: 'Remember to maintain a calm mind while doing difficult tasks.'

Knox sent an email to the Florence courtroom pleading her innocence last week in a move which appeared not to impress the judge. Judge Alessandro Nencini said such an email from a defendant was ‘irregular’, adding: ‘If you want to speak to the trial you have to come to the trial.'

The trial is expected to conclude in mid-January.
