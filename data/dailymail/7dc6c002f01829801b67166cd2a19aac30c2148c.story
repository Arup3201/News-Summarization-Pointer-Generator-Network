Bleddyn King, 18 (pictured) is alleged to have stabbed David Evans, 63, and then used his mobile phone to film his body

A teenage killer used his mobile phone to film the body of his victim after brutally stabbing him 72 times, a court has heard.

Bleddyn King, 18, allegedly recorded a chilling soundtrack to the video after killing David Evans, 63, in his own home.

Cardiff Crown Court heard King said: 'F*** around with me and this is what happens. You **** with me and you **** with the best.'

King is alleged to have used an internet dating site for gay men to contact Evans with the intention of robbing him.

A murder jury was told King went to Evans' country bungalow, where the widower lived alone, pulled a knife on him and stabbed him so forcefully the blade was left bent.

Prosecutor Michael Mather-Lees QC said: 'It was brutality of the extreme kind.

'After he was dead King videoed his body while giving a dialogue (sic) of what he had done and why he was doing it.

'It was because he was short of money.

'He made a video of the death scene to scare people he may have owed money to.

'He is heard saying: '**** around with me and this is what happens. You **** with me and you **** with the best.'

'The film was made to instil fear of him in somebody else.'

Torched: King is alleged to have set fire to the bungalow before making his escape

The court heard King then stabbed Mr Evans’ cat Jess to death before setting the bungalow on fire and escaping.

Father-of-two Evans, of Pentyrch, near Cardiff, was described as a ‘lost soul' following the death of his wife Christine, and was said to have turned to gay websites.

He was only 5ft 6in tall and weighed eight-and-a-half stones compared to King who was described as having a 'muscular and powerful physique'.

Mather-Lees said: 'Mr Evans was a quiet and gentle man who had married, had two boys and lived in France for a time.

'He and his wife moved back to Cardiff, where he nursed her when she became ill.'

The court heard King used the name 'Big Wolf 1993' on the gay website where he contacted Evans and another man after hatching a plan to rob them.

Mather-Lees said: 'He developed a plan - he deliberately, callously and brutally targeted a gay man for his own gain.

'He chose a gay man because he thought he would be somebody more vulnerable and that if he survived his attack would be less likely to complain.

'It was a plain and simple premeditated robbery with extreme violence contemplated.

'It was executed and then followed with cynical lies.'

King, of Abercynon, near Pontypridd, denies murder but has admitted manslaughter.

The trial continues.
