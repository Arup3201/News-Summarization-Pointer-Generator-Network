Lewis Hamilton has become the latest high-profile figure from the sporting world to take part in the Ice Bucket Challenge.

Nominated by Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo, who performed the stunt in the paddock on Thursday, Hamilton accepted the Australian’s challenge after today’s opening practice session ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix. 

The 29-year-old Briton hopped out of his Mercedes before he was promptly drenched by four of his mechanics armed with two rather large buckets.

Making waves: The Briton took the soaking in good spirits before later nominating Will Smith and Tom Cruise 

Wow, that was cold: Hamilton, still wearing his Mercedes overalls, was soaked through 

A sodden Hamilton, still wearing his overalls, then walked coolly to the back of the Mercedes garage. 

He later nominated British model Naomi Campbell and Hollywood actors’ Will Smith and Tom Cruise to take in the phenomenon which is raising awareness for the disease ALS.

Hamilton is 11 points adrift of team-mate Nico Rosberg as we move into the second half of the title campaign. He was one tenth slower than his rival in the first practice session at Spa-Francorchamps.
