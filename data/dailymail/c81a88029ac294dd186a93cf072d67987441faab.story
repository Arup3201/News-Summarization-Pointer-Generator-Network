Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes manager Louis van Gaal's greatest challenge is accommodating the attacking options he now has at his disposal.

However, he admits the Dutchman also has to sort out the Red Devils' suspect defence if they are to secure a return to the Champions League this season.

The £59.7million arrival of Argentina winger Angel di Maria and on-loan Colombia striker Radamel Falcao means Van Gaal now has to fit them into a team which also has England and Holland captains Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie, Spain international Juan Mata and precocious teenager Adnan Januzaj.

Selection dilema: Van Gaal's biggest problem will be fitting all his forwards into a team at Old Trafford

Falcao could make his debut at home to QPR on Sunday but it remains to be seen how the United boss will set up his side.

Asked if the biggest problem is fitting everyone into a starting XI, Scholes told MUTV: 'It is yeah, but it's not a bad problem to have.

'Fans have been moaning about the type of players that were at the club and now you can't do that.

'I think Ed Woodward (executive vice-chairman) has done his job brilliantly during this transfer window with some great signings.

Bringing up the rear: Former United midfielder Paul Scholes also thinks that United's defence must improve

'The calibre of player we have brought in is top quality, like Di Maria and Falcao.

'These are proper players. We just have to find a way of getting them all in the same team, playing well and scoring goals - which we have struggled to do a little bit.

'Now it is over to the manager to sort everything out and make us a good team again.

'Defensively we haven't been great either so he needs to sort that out. Then, I'm sure we can be vying for Champions League places.'

Di Maria has proven his versatility in a number of positions for club and country but Scholes feels he has to become the go-to winger for his new side.

'I would like to see Di Maria play wide,' Scholes added.

'Whether van Gaal is going to play with wide players I'm not too sure, but we saw the other night that he was devastating for Argentina against Germany in wide areas.

'Whether it is the right or left-hand side, his pace is frightening.

'He can go past players and score goals. That is something we have been missing.

'I am sure he can play in the central areas as well, but if I was picking him then it would be in the wide areas.'

Scholes is optimistic United will see the best of Falcao again after his recovery from anterior knee ligament surgery.

'Falcao's goalscoring record is brilliant from when he has been at Porto and Atletico Madrid,' said the midfielder.

'The goals he has scored have been important, then there is the movement he brings and his experience as well at 28 years of age.

'You just hope his knee is right, I think that will be the main problem but once he gets going and Di Maria can start creating chances for him then I'm sure we will start scoring goals.'
