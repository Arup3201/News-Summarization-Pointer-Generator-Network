Chelsea striker Diego Costa was fortunate not to be sent off for stamping on Liverpool's Emre Can, according to former Premier League referee and Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll.

The ex-Atletico Madrid man was attempting to grab the ball for a throw-in during his side's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg when he came down hard on the lower part of Can's right leg.

The 21-year-old German was left writhing on the turf in pain but referee Michael Oliver allowed play to go on as normal after the incident, with Costa avoiding a card.

But Poll believes the forward was lucky not to be sent for an early bath with the tie evenly poised at 0-0 on the night and 1-1 on aggregate.

Poll said: 'Diego Costa should have been dismissed early on against Liverpool for a blatant stamp on Emre Can and that would have cost Chelsea dear.

'They would have missed him for the rest of this game and then the massive Premier league clash against Manchester City this Saturday. 

'The question now is will the Football Association act retrospectively and charge Costa with violent conduct? To do so they have to check that referee Michael Oliver did not see the incident; it might seem obvious that he didn't as he took no disciplinary action but once Oliver confirms that neither he nor his colleagues saw the stamp they should charge Costa.

COSTA'S STAMP

Costa is confronted by Emre Can in the 12th minute after stamping on the Liverpool star's ankle.

POLL'S VERDICT: Costa should have been dismissed for the stamp. The question is will the FA charge Costa with violent conduct? To do so they have to check ref Michael Oliver didn't see it.

PENALTY KICK?

Martin Skrtel appears to bring down Costa in the area in the 23rd minute but Oliver gives a goal-kick. Sky pundit Thierry Henry said at half-time: 'Skrtel doesn't need to commit, the referee had a clear view and didn't give a penalty.'

POLL'S VERDICT: Jose Mourinho can have a Justifiable moan about the 'campaign' against Chelsea after Costa is clearly fouled by Skrtel. Oliver has a clear view but awards a goal-kick when it should have been a penalty.

HALF-TIME RAGE

Outraged by Oliver's decision not to award Costa a penalty, Mourinho confronted the referee in the tunnel at half-time and had to be shepherded away by fourth official Phil Dowd.

POLL'S VERDICT: If they did their jobs, the officials would report Mourinho. Managers are not allowed to do this.

SECOND STAMP 

Costa and Skrtel tangle again in the 54th minute. This time the Chelsea striker stamps on the defender's foot when the pair chase a loose ball and Skrtel retaliates by swinging his foot at Costa.

POLL'S VERDICT: I'd give Costa the benefit of the doubt as he was airborne and had to land somewhere. But both players should have been cautioned as they went head to head.

HEAD TO HEAD

Costa tussles with Steven Gerrard in the 12th minute of extra-time and puts his hand over the Liverpool captain's face. The pair go head to head and are both booked.

POLL'S VERDICT: Having decided not to caution Costa and Skrtel, he gave yellow cards to Costa and Gerrard when they repeated the head-to-head act.

'That should be done by 6pm on Wednesday meaning that a ban could be imposed in time to take effect for Saturday. Whether Chelsea would appeal would depend on whether that could cause enough delay to make Costa available for Saturday's key fixture.

'There can be no blame attached to Oliver for missing the Costa incident as replays showed his view, from a good position, was blocked by Jordan Henderson. In fact Oliver's positioning was good throughout the first half when he correctly waved Chelsea's very early penalty appeals away when the ball struck Lucas Leiva on the arm.'

Jose Mourinho's men welcome champions City to Stamford Bridge this Saturday, with the game likely to have a huge impact on the title race. Chelsea currently sit top of the Premier League, five points clear of Manuel Pellegrini's side. 

Sky Sports pundits Jamie Redknapp and Thierry Henry both agreed with Poll at half-time, insisting that £32million man Costa should have seen red.

Sportsmail columnist Redknapp said: 'It's a blatant red card, bang out of order and takes a liberty. He stamps and it's a certain red card, but the ref can't see it. The implications would have been huge because he would have missed the game on Saturday [against Manchester City].

Henry added: 'It is a red card. He knows what he is doing . We all love his passion but he didn't have to go all the way and step on the guy.' 

Poll had more sympathy for Costa later in the first half when he went down inside Liverpool's box after a clumsy challenge from Martin Skrtel.

Oliver, who booked Costa for diving against Burnley earlier this season, waved away the Spain international's appeals for a penalty but did not show him a yellow card. 

Poll said: 'I struggle to understand Olivers' decision to award Liverpool a goal-kick in the 22nd minute after Martin Skrtel tripped Costa. 

'Oliver had gone wide to get a good view and by awarding a goal-kick he indicated that Skrtel had not played the ball. So, for Oliver surely either Costa dived or it was a penalty. 

'Oliver, of course cautioned Costa in the opening game of the season when he wrongly thought he had dived at Burnley. This time he didn't go that far but should have given Chelsea the penalty they deserved for Skrtel's unnecessary challenge which caught Costa.'

Former Arsenal striker Henry was in agreement, despite some reservations when seeing the incident live.

'I thought it wasn't a penalty at first but the more I see it the more I think that it is,' he said. 'I don't know why Skrtel needs to commit.' 

Poll added: 'Jose Mourinho looked furious and no doubt feels this added to his feeling that match officials are against him and Chelsea. 

'If they did their jobs they would report him for his approach to the them in the tunnel before the start of the second half. 

'Managers are not permitted to do this as Mourinho knows, as does fourth official Phil Dowd who was seen alerting Mourinho that his actions were on camera.'

Costa was at the centre of more controversy in the second half when he again caught a Liverpool player with his studs.

The Chelsea man was running towards goal when his left boot caught that of Skrtel, an incident which resulted in the pair going face-to-face with each other in an angry exchange. 

Poll said: 'Costa was involved in another clash and potential stamp early in the second half as he trod on Skrtel after the Liverpool defender had tackled him fairly. 

'I'd give Costa the benefit of the doubt on this one as he was airbourne and had to land somewhere. Referees cannot guess, nor look at a player's reputation, hence the benefit of doubt going Costa's way.

'Both players should though have been cautioned as they went head-to-head after the incident. We used to call that 'adopting an aggressive attitude' and would always book both players. Now that's clearly not the case.'

Costa was involved in one final scuffle when he clashed with Steven Gerrard in the 12th minute of extra-time.

The striker put his hand around Gerrard's face as they wrestled each other to the floor. After standing up, they went head-to-head before dragged apart by concerned team-mates.

Speaking about the incident, Poll said: 'Having decided not to caution Costa and Skrtel, he gave yellow cards to Costa and Gerrard when they repeated the head-to-head act.'
