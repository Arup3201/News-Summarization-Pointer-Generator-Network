Leicester City

David Nugent is set to return for Leicester at West Ham after missing last week's defeat to Manchester City with a calf injury.

He will be assessed before the game while goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel is out after breaking a metatarsal last week which will rule him out for at least five more weeks.

Matt Upson is close to a comeback after a long-standing foot injury but will not be risked as he returns to full fitness.

Provisional squad: Hamer, Moore, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Drinkwater, James, King, Cambiasso, Albrighton, Hammond, Mahrez, Knockaert, Vardy, Ulloa, Nugent, Schlupp, Wood, Powell.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Kevin Nolan has scored three goals in four Premier League appearances against Leicester.

Leicester City are without a win in six league meetings with West Ham United (D3 L3).

There have been five red cards in the last eight league meetings between West Ham and Leicester.

Leicester City are winless in their last 11 Premier League fixtures (L9 D2) – the longest such run seen in the competition so far in 2014-15.

No player has created more goalscoring opportunities than Stewart Downing (50) in the Premier League so far this season.

Leicester City have not beaten West Ham since Robbie Savage scored the winning goal in a 2-1 Premier League victory in December 2000. Here the Welshman protests against referee Graham Poll after being given a warning for celebrating his strike with home fans at Filbert Street

No side have had a larger spread of goalscorers than West Ham United (12) this season in the Premier League (Chelsea also have 12).

The Foxes have not won any of their last 17 Premier League away trips to London (D3 L14) & have conceded at least two goals in each of their last eight PL away trips in the capital.

Anything less than a win in this game will ensure Leicester are bottom at Christmas. Only two teams (WBA in 2004 and Sunderland in 2013) have been bottom of the PL at Xmas and avoided relegation.

West Ham have never before been in the top four of the Premier League at Christmas.

The last time that the Hammers were in the top four positions of the top-flight on Christmas Day was back in 1985. They finished that season in third.
