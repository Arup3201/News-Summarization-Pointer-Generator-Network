Two volunteer paramedics 'seeking only to do good' at the scene of accidents must be prosecuted for using sirens and flashing lights, the High Court has ordered - 'with regret'.

Judges upheld an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against a refusal by Bury magistrates to convict Michael Issler and Mordechai Bamberger for using 'blues-and-twos'.

The warning sirens and lights - used by police, paramedics and firefighters - helped the pair get to the scenes of accidents quicker than ambulances to give vital first aid.

'Blues-and-twos': The flashing blue light of a police car, like the ones used by Michael Issler and Mordechai Bamberger as they carried out their duties as medical volunteers for Salford's Hatzola service

The judges agreed that their use by civilians was in breach of road traffic regulations, but suggested that there might be scope for Parliament to change the rules.

Lady Justice Rafferty, sitting with Mr Justice Jay in London, said she was 'saddened that medically trained citizens seeking only to do good, part of a scrupulously professional organisation with high standards and conspicuously shunning gratuitous publicity, find themselves effectively constrained in their efforts'.

The initial prosecution came after Issler and Bamberger attended a accident involving a car and a motorcycle on the outskirts of Bury on October 14, 2012.

Wearing high-visibility uniforms, they identified themselves to police as Hatzola Fast Response personnel and were allowed to offer medical assistance in advance of an NHS ambulance arriving at 8.25pm.

But officers told the two men they would be reported for using the blues-and-twos on their vehicles.

District Judge Richardson was told at their trial that Hatzola originated in the U.S. about 40 years ago with the overriding objective of preserving life, and has since spread to the UK.

Its aim is to provide emergency first-aid cover in defined areas, in this case Salford and parts of Bury, primarily but not exclusively for the Jewish community.

In Salford there are 20 Hatzola volunteers, 10 of whom are trained paramedics, including Mr Issler and Mr Bamberger.

Their average response time to accidents is 'under two minutes', compared with seven to 10 minutes for NHS ambulances, the court heard.

Their vehicles - Mr Issler's Renault Grand Espace Dynamique and Mr Bamberger's Mercedes saloon - carry medical equipment, including defibrillators, oxygen, and neck braces, as well as dressings, medications and some drugs.

The Royal Courts of Justice: Mr Justice Jay said current laws did not provide an exemption for 'first responder' voluntary organisations like Hatzola to escape the restrictions on the use of blues-and-twos

First founded in Brooklyn, New York, in the late Sixties, Hatzola is a volunteer emergency medical service which now has a presence in Jewish communities throughout the world.

As an organisation, it is the largest volunteer ambulance service in the world but, in effect, most groups work independently and are locally funded by donations from the Jewish community.

Subscribers are given a special emergency number to call to put them through to a dispatcher, who then passes on the emergency message to the closest volunteer.

Hatzolah's organisational model provides for response times that are typically much faster than public emergency services.

Hatzolah is a Hebrew word meaning 'rescue' or 'relief'. It is sometimes also known as Chevra Hatzolah, which loosely translates as 'Company of Rescuers'.

Judge Richardson said Hatzola's 24-hour-a-day work was funded by voluntary contributions from the Jewish community and declared: 'I found Hatzola to be a responsible, dedicated and public-spirited organisation with well-trained and motivated operatives, of whom the defendants were two.'

He acquitted both men of the blues-and-twos charge on the grounds that their vehicles were being 'used for ambulance purposes'.

But now the High Court judges have ruled that he had got the law wrong and agreed 'with regret' that the DPP's appeal must be allowed.

Mr Justice Jay said road traffic legislation and the relevant regulations did not currently provide an exemption for 'first responder' voluntary organisations like Hatzola to escape the restrictions on the use of blues-and-twos.

He added: 'To be clear: widening the exemption to reflect the modern context is a task for the Secretary of State and Parliament, if so advised, and not for this court.'

The judge suggested it would not be difficult for legislators 'to alight on a form of words' to include Hatzola personnel within the exemption.

Lady Justice Rafferty emphasised the 'importance or potential importance' of the case and her own 'reluctance to allow this appeal'.

Agreeing with Mr Justice Jay's ruling, she said: 'Like him, I am driven to the view that this appeal must be allowed.

'Like him, I am saddened that medically trained citizens seeking only to do good, part of a scrupulously professional organisation with high standards and conspicuously shunning gratuitous publicity, find themselves effectively constrained in their efforts.'
