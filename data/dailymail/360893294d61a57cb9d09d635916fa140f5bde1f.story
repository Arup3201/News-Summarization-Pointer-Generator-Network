The family of a grandfather who was savagely beaten after he got out to help a 10-year-old boy he hit with his pick-up truck are demanding answers over the attack.

Steve Utash, 54, is still critically injured five days after he hit David Harris in a busy street in Detroit.

His distraught family say he has no health insurance and have already raised more than $100,000 for his care in an online campaign.

Coma: Steve Utash is still in a critical condition five days after he was beaten by an angry mob in Detroit

Accident: Mr Utash was driving his pick-up truck when 10-year-old David Harris darted into the street

Anger: Mr Utash's son Joe and daughter Felicia gave their emotional reactions to NBC News

Tears: Mr Utash's brother-in-law Max Mohr said doctors could not confirm if the 54-year-old would survive

His son Joe said: 'If you are that concerned about the kid why are you jumping all over my dad and jumping in his truck and stealing his belongings?'

In the emotional interviews with NBC News, Mr Utash's brother-in-law Max Mohr broke down in tears as he revealed medics were unable to say if the 54-year-old would survive.

'I pray to God he had better make it,' he said. 'They're saying that they don't know for sure yet'.

Mr Utash's daughter Felicia added: 'It's hard just to see him lying in bed not knowing who we are, where he is, what's going on.'

Two Detroit boys aged 16 and 17 were arrested on Saturday over the beating, with Detroit police spokesman Sgt Mike Woody saying investigators believed they had a direct role in the attack on the city's east side.

He's going to survive: David Harris, 10, suffered a broken leg after running into traffic in the busy street

Group of friends: Surveillance footage from a nearby gas station showed David running into the street after standing at the side of the road with four individuals. Police say up to 12 people could have been involved

Fundraising: Members of the public have already raised more than $100,000 for Mr Utash's medical bills

Woody
 said no charges would be immediately filed against the teens while 
investigators continue their work. Police believe at least six and as many as 12 people may have been involved.

'We still have a long 
way to go,' Sgt Woody said. 'I've been reminding people we're still at the very beginning 
stage of this investigation.'

The case has outraged the public, clergy and elected officials. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan called the attack 'senseless.'

Appealing for calm on Twitter, he wrote: 'This week a group of young men showed who they were when they beat Steve Utash. Let us show who we are in our response. #calm #compassion'

The boy’s family condemned the beating.

‘We don’t condone that at all,’ James Duston Jr, the boy's godfather, told local media. ‘I told his mom and she just was like, no, we wouldn’t want that to happen.’

Tree trimmer Utash, from Clinton Township, accidentally struck the 10-year-old boy with his 
pickup truck last Wednesday.

Security 
footage from a gas station Harris and friends were standing in front of 
shows him inexplicably running into oncoming traffic before being mowed 
down by Utash's vehicle.

Utash
 immediately stops to check on the boy, but several black males from 
their late teens to their early 20s quickly descend on the scene.

Police quickly ruled the incident an accident and said Mr Utash wouldn't have had any chance of stopping in time.

A 
prominent black pastor, the Rev. Horace Sheffield III, called on the 
public to go block by block to find the 'heartless perpetrators.'

Appeal: Mayor Mike Duggan urged citizens of Detroit to react with calm and compassion

Devastated: Daughter Felicia Utash (right) insisted her father (left) was only trying to do the right thing

It was
 important for community members 'to prove that we equally deplore 
justice and unbridled brutality no matter what color the victim is or of
 the one committing it,' Sheffield said in a statement.

More than 80 per cent of Detroit's population is black, but police have ruled out hate crime as a motive.

Officers did, however, say Mr Utash's wallet was stolen. Detroit has been crippled financially by the collapse of its automotive industries and unofficial estimates put unemployment at 20 per cent.

Police
told MailOnline around a dozen young males attacked the married 
father of three, beating him into a coma from which he still hadn't woken.

'It’s not like he hit the kid on purpose and they were trying to get revenge,' daughter Felicia Utash told WXYZ. 'He literally just tried to stop and help the kid and people came out of nowhere and tried to kill him.'

His son Joseph Utash hinted it might have been a setup to rob his father.

'I
 think it was all a setup from the gate,' he told CBS Detroit. 'My dad’s
 been driving up and down Morang for 15, 16 years working for the same 
company... they know he has money and they robbed him.

Brutal: The unidentified driver was savagely beaten after stopping to check on the young boy he accidentally hit with while driving this pickup truck

Where it happened: The boy ran out into the street at this spot on Detroit's east side, police said

The 10-year-old boy suffered a broken leg, he has since been released from a local hospital, Moreno said. A message left with the family seeking further comment has not yet been returned.

‘This little boy was screaming,’ a woman told the Free Press. ‘There was a lot of people that came out. It was crazy.'

Another said: 'I think it lasted about one minute and 
then they let him go... And then they jumped back
 on him again and they did it about three times and finally someone was 
trying to help the guy that got beat up.’

‘He had the biggest gash on his head I 
ever seen – he was bleeding from the mouth and he was unconscious when I
 first got there,’ Debra Hughes told WWJ.

‘It was sad because I knew the guy was getting out of his car to try and see what damage he did,’ the witness added.

‘He got his,’ another witness to the beating told the Free Press. ‘He got beat up real bad.’
