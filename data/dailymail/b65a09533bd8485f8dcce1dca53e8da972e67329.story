The former 
Commons Deputy Speaker who was cleared of rape and sexual assault faces a
 plot by his local party to deselect him after he revealed he would like
 a gay marriage.

After his trial earlier this year, Nigel Evans was welcomed back to Parliament by fellow MPs.

However,
 his local party has been engulfed in a row over whether he is fit to 
remain as candidate, while the chairman of the Tory association has 
quit.

Michael
 Ranson, 72, has supported Mr Evans since he came out as gay three years
 ago, and was also his election agent. But it is claimed the chairman’s 
‘final straw’ came when the MP told an interviewer he would like to one 
day marry a man.

Former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans was cleared of a string of sex assaults, but is facing a grassroots campaign to deselect him as a Tory candidate for the next election

Opponents 
are also unhappy about disclosures during the court case, including Mr 
Evans’s admission that he slept with a 22-year-old man who was on work 
experience.

The
 executive committee of the  Ribble Valley association in Lancashire 
will now vote on whether Mr Evans, who has a majority of more than 
14,000, should be re-adopted as their candidate in the coming weeks. If 
they decide not to, Mr Evans can demand a ballot of all local Tory 
members.

Mr
 Evans, who claims he has the support of senior Tories including the 
Prime Minister, last night said that he was ‘confident’ that he would 
win the ballot, but admitted that he had heard local whisperings.

He said: ‘I’m convinced that I will get through the process with flying colours. The vast majority of people are supporting me.

‘Clearly 
you do get to hear some comments via other people that there are some 
sort of mutterings and concerns but the reality is I was acquitted by a 
court of all charges.

‘There’s
 only going to be a small element of homophobia but it’s incredibly rare
 to hear any of it. The vast majority were delighted when I came out in 
2010, that I’m able to get on with my life, and wish me well for the 
future.’

Mr
 Ranson, who is mayor of Ribble Valley, is said to have fallen out with 
Mr Evans following his acquittal after he told his local newspaper, ‘I 
would love to have a serious, committed and special relationship with 
another man. I would like to have a gay marriage.’

A supporter of Mr Evans said: ‘That, according to Mr Ranson, was the final straw.’ 

Last
 night Mr Ranson declined to comment on the reselection row and declined
 to discuss the reasons for his resignation from the association last 
week.

He said: ‘I would prefer not to comment at the moment, as this is an association matter.’ 

Asked
 specifically about the claim he became unhappy with Mr Evans’s comments
 about gay marriage, he said: ‘I do not comment on such nonsense.’

Other senior figures in the constituency spoke privately of a mood of increasing conflict within the association.

One
 said: ‘It’s split down the middle ... It’s nothing to do with 
homophobia – that’s a complete red herring introduced by Nigel.

‘Those against him simply feel that for all that he was innocent at his trial, his behaviour left a lot to be desired.

‘They’re
 asking whether it was right for him to surround himself with young men 
in and around Westminster. They see his conduct as unbecoming for an 
MP.’

Another
 said: ‘People in the Ribble Valley are generally pretty 
straightforward. They just want a hard-working MP to fight for them. 
What they’ve found in Nigel is a man who gives the impression of just 
going to London to have a ball.’

Meanwhile Conservative voters have written to the local paper calling for Mr Evans to step aside.

In April, Mr Evans was cleared by a jury at Preston Crown Court of raping a man and sexually assaulting six others.

When
 he returned to work, he was toasted with a drinks party in Westminster 
and was last week elected to the executive of the 1922 Committee, the 
powerful body of backbench Tories.
