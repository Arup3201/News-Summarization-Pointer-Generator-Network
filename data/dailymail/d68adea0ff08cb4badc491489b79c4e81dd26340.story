When the clock strikes midnight on January 1, many people compile a list of New Year's resolutions in a bid to shed away those bad habits and pledge for a fresh start.

With January done and dusted, many of those resolutions have already been forgotten or ditched altogether, only to be replaced by the same old routines.

'Australia's Number One Fitness Guy' and former World Ironman Champion Guy Leech believes simply making a resolution isn't good enough to motivate you through to the finish line.

The 50-year-old from Sydney's Northern Beaches said quite often he hears people making the same mistake of setting up resolutions they can't measure or track.

The father of two said it's important to find a strong reason behind your resolutions to be able to achieve it

'If you can't measure it, how can you hope to achieve it?' Leech told Daily Mail Australia.

'There needs to be an important reason behind why you're setting that particular goal. Set a goal that means a lot to you because it'll give you that strength to do it.

'We've seen nine out of 10 goals fail because they weren't strong enough. Only one out of 10 people have made goals that mean a lot to their lives and because of this, they would be committed.'

Rather than setting up goals that seem out of reach, Leech suggests breaking down the bigger resolutions into smaller goals that can be achieved slowly as you go.

'Don't say I want to lose 12 kilos or just pick a random number that you want to lose because it'll only make it tough to follow through. You need to set little goals around it to reach that big goal.

'Actually find something that you like  doing. Don't take up a boot camp or a 12-week cross fit program because you feel like you need to - pick something you can see yourself doing.

'And don't be afraid to tell your family and friends what your goals are - what that does is put a lot of pressure on you and they will support you through if you start to feel like giving up.

The 50-year-old said writing down your resolutions and looking at it everyday keeps your ambitions alive

Taking the time to write out resolutions and sticking them in places where you can always see them keeps you motivated and your ambitions at the forefront of your mind.

'When you set your goals -  write it down and look at it everyday. Chances are - if you rarely see your goals, you're likely to forget about them,' Leech said.

'Seeing your goals written out in black and white can work as a powerful motivator, and can really make the difference as to whether you end up achieving them.

'These are all common sense but it's also important to remind ourselves that if we focus too much on numbers [kilograms] and not on the benefits of doing it - it's harder to reach our goals.'

When it comes to fitness motivation, the father of two said partnering up with someone who has the same or similar goals could be very helpful.

'Going on the journey with someone is always more fun and more motivating than doing it alone,' Leech said.

Many Australians are caught up in their busy work schedules but Leech suggests trying to move as much as you can is one part of your daily routine to being fit and healthy.

'Find more ways to move - don't take the lift, take the stairs; get off the bus a few stops early or walk to work if possible - it's the simple strategy that anyone can do.

'We are lucky to have the same amount of hours each week and it's not about the time - it's all about the priority. Set your alarm clock earlier so you can do something in the morning.

'Change your cycle around so you're feeling positive and great during the day and you would be able to sleep better and early at night. 

'You've got to look for ways to move. Technology has robbed our process of moving - not being able to get up and switch our TV has taken around 10,000 steps away from our lives.

As for setting up that 'New Year's resolution', Leech said it doesn't matter when these goals are made during the year.

'You don't need to wait until Christmas or January to start thinking about your  resolutions - being healthy and fit can start any time of the year,' he said.

'There will always be hurdles along the way but once you have a purpose and a big reason behind your resolutions, you'll get to the finish line.' 

Guy Leech reveals his top tips to make those resolutions go the distance

1. Why? Why? Why?

Simply making a resolution isn't enough, there needs to be an important reason behind WHY you're setting that particular goal. 'If you think about what you stand to gain by achieving a goal, and how you will feel when you get there, it will make it much easier to follow through' explains Leech. To keep your goals front of mind, set up an inspiration board somewhere in your home with quotes, pictures and anything that inspires you and reminds you of your goals.

2. Be S.M.A.R.T

Set yourself up for success by making SMART resolutions, by ensuring your goal is: Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Realistic and Time-based.  It's a really good idea to start a goals diary where you can document the details of your SMART goals and track your progress.

3. Outta' Sight Outta' Mind

Write your goals up and place them in a spot that you frequently see, like on the fridge, the bathroom mirror, or taped to your computer screen at work.

4. Break it up 

'If a resolution is too big, it can be very intimidating and entirely off-putting,' says Leech. 'Provide yourself with achievable milestones along the way to reaching your goal, acknowledge when you achieve each one and reward yourself as you go, rather than just at the end,' recommends Leech. 'For example, if your goal is to run a half marathon, you might set a goal to run 5km, 10km and then 15km by a certain date, gradually working your way to the full distance and high-fiving yourself as your running fitness improves.'

5. Talk about it

Don't be afraid to tell your friends, family and co-workers about your resolutions. 'If the people around you can support your goals, they will be able to keep you on track when you might otherwise be tempted to waiver,' says Leech. Likewise, it's great to partner up with someone so you have you have a buddy to keep you on track and to keep you accountable.

6. Keep tabs on yourself

It's always a good idea keep track of your successes and struggles along the way. Making notes of your weekly efforts or giving yourself a rating out 10 can be a really simple way to keep your motivation up. 'Reflecting on successes and struggles throughout your journey is a really powerful tool as it allows you to be mindful of what does and doesn't work. I find keeping a journal or note book on any fitness journey incredibly important,' says Leech.

7. Control the inner voice

'Never underestimate the power of what you tell yourself,' insists Leech. 'It is important keep control of the voice in your head and feed yourself positive messages. It is surprising how damaging your negative thoughts can be, while positive thinking pays off in spades.'
