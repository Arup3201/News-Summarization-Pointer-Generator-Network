'Abusive': Margaret Walker, 73, is alleged to have targeted Muslims, the Chinese, Jews and the Scottish in letters sent across the UK

An elderly woman accused of sending hundreds of racist letters has told a court that she wanted to raise issues she feels 'the establishment' are ignoring.

Margaret Walker, 73, is alleged to have targeted Muslims, the Chinese, Jews and the Scottish in abusive correspondence sent across the UK.

She claims the letters are necessary because police in Britain are 'not doing their job properly'.

Walker is contesting an attempt by police to give her an anti-social behaviour order, banning her from sending any more offensive letters.

Police say that Walker told them she will continue to send the handwritten 'campaign leaflets' until she is ordered to stop by a court.

The pensioner began sending letters across the country in 2007, to hospitals, businesses and local politicians.

By her own admission she has sent about 500 of her handwritten letters, with many complaining about immigration and calling for Britain to pull out of the EU.

The letters were reported to police, who were able to trace them back to Walker in 2009 through DNA and fingerprint evidence.

Walker was then arrested at her home in Fareham, near Portsmouth, Hampshire.

Julian Knowles QC, prosecuting, told Fareham Magistrates' Court: 'The letters Mrs Walker sent can be deemed as abusive, offensive, racist, obscene, distressing and harassing.

'The letters had a poisonous and corrosive effect on the recipients because they naturally thought they came from someone they knew.'

Mr Knowles added: 'Mrs Walker’s attitude expressed to the police that she will continue to do this unless ordered to stop by the courts.

'She is on a crusade, for want of a better expression.'

Giving evidence, Walker denied the terms she used to describe different ethnic groups are offensive.

She said: 'I’m English and if you are English today with a voice, you are called racist.'

Trial: Margaret Walker is said to have told police that she will continue to send her 'campaign leaflets' until she is ordered to stop by a court

Tim Rait, regional press officer for the BNP, gave evidence for the defence during the trial.

The party were mentioned in several of Mrs Walker’s letters but under cross-examination Rait admitted the party did not support her campaign.

He said: 'I cannot associate ourselves with it.'

Walker had previously said in evidence: 'I am not a member of the BNP, but I admire and support them.'

The trial continues.
