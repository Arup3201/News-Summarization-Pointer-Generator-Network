The American father who, along with his wife, was imprisoned in Qatar for more than a year after being accused of starving their daughter has revealed he was sexually assaulted behind bars.

Matthew and Grace Huang finally flew home to Los Angeles on Thursday after a Qatari judge last week cleared them in the death of their eight-year-old adopted daughter, Gloria.

A day after her unexplained death in Qatar in 2013, the couple were thrown behind bars.

'I was physically and sexually assaulted,' Matthew CBS News in their first interview. 'Another inmate tried to rape me. I - as a victim - I fought back.'

Freed: Matthew and Grace Huang arrived back in the U.S. on Thursday after a two-year legal battle following the sudden death of their adopted daughter, Gloria. They spent more than a year behind bars

The couple moved to Qatar in 2012 for Matthew's job as an engineer for an American firm. They moved with their three children, Gloria, Emanuel and Josiah, who were all adopted from Africa.

In January 2013, Gloria - who was severely malnourished before she was adopted age four - started foaming at the mouth, her father said. He tried to save her but she passed away in hospital.

Without carrying out a full autopsy of the girl, Qatari police turned their attention to the parents, who are of Asian descent. They were suspicious of the mixed-race family, the couple said.

An initial police report raised questions about why the couple would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits'. 

'They thought we were human traffickers,' Matthew said. 'They said we adopted our children to either harvest their organs or to do medical tests on them.

'I mean, this is an outrageous charge against us - a loving family. But the Qatari authorities just didn't understand multi-ethnic adoption.' 

Reunited: The couple appeared with their two adopted sons, Emanuel and Josiah, at their church in Pasadena, California on Sunday - but they said they felt the absence of their daughter

Grace added: 'For me, the hardest part, I think, was being asked over and over, "Are you the real mom?"'

Prosecutors said the couple denied food to their daughter and locked her in her room at night.

The Huangs said Gloria suffered from medical problems complicated by an eating disorder that was the result of her impoverished early years in Africa.

They were thrown in jail and the boys were sent to a Qatari orphanage for four months. While locked up, Grace said she felt fear for her children and guilt that she could not protect them.

'I was angry with myself,' she said. 'Like, what could I have done to keep them from taking the kids away?'

Their case was finally heard for the first time in November 2013 and they were convicted of child endangerment and sentenced to three years in prison. 

But after a year in prison, holes started to emerge in the prosecution's case and a judge granted them bail.

Ripped apart: Following her death, her brothers were put into a Qatari orphanage for four months

A forensic pathologist hired by the family concluded there was 'no medical evidence' that the girl was starved by her parents and a proper autopsy was never carried out. 

During that time, the U.S. State Department called the case 'unfair' but failed to lobby for their release - and Matthew said he wonders if that was political. 

'The U.S. government could have done a lot more, a lot quicker,' he told CBS. 'Qatar is such an important military base -- for the U.S. I felt like the U.S. government was unwilling to rock the boat and unwilling to make a strong stance with knowing that we were innocent.'

But the department argued that Secretary Kerry had discussed it with the foreign minister.

Then last Sunday, a Qatari judge finally overturned their conviction - but their passports were confiscated at the airport later that day.

Their situation remained tense until the moment of their departure Wednesday, with Mr Huang being detained for several minutes at the airport's passport control station as his wife watched in tears. 

Return: The Huangs finally left Qatar on Wednesday after a appeals judge threw out their conviction

Back home:The couple was reunited with their children and other relatives after they landed on Thursday

They finally arrived back in Los Angeles on Thursday.

'Mission accomplished. Matt and Grace are in Los Angeles,' The David House Agency, which represents them, tweeted. 'They have not stopped smiling.'

The couple said they are relieved to be home and were pictured with their two sons at their Pasadena church on Sunday.

'It was just nice to be there with our church family again,' Grace said. 'But at the same time, we were just sitting in our usual order with the kids in between us, but there was just one who was missing.'
