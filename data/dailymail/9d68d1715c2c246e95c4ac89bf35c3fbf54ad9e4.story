A woman who has dedicated her life to transforming herself into Barbie is taking her obsession with becoming a doll to extreme lengths - by having hypnotherapy to make her 'brainless'.

Blondie Bennett, 38, from California, has sessions once a week to make her more easily confused and vacant.

The former model, who changed her name to Blondie a year and a half ago, has also spent £25,000 on five breast enlargements taking her to a size 32JJ.

Blondie Bennett is taking her quest to become a doll to the extreme by having hypnotherapy to make her 'brainless'

She is now unemployed and earns a living by taking money from online sugar daddies who support her in 
exchange for sexy pictures of her dressed as Barbie.

Blondie regularly has spray tans, Botox and lip fillers to give her a more artificial appearance. But to make the transformation into the plastic toy complete, she is actively trying to become more stupid.

She said: 'When people ask why I want to be Barbie I think "who wouldn't want to be?"

'She has the best life. All she does is shop and make herself look pretty - she doesn't worry about anything.

'I've had 20 session and I'm already starting to feel ditzy and confused all the time.

'Recently I went to pick a friend up at the airport and couldn't remember if I needed to go to departures or arrivals. I also got lost for three hours driving to my mum's house - the house where I grew up.'

Blondie says her obsession with Barbie began at a young age, when she played with the children's favourite.

In her teens she dressed like Barbie, bleached her hair and even had drove a Corvette like her hero.

Then, at 18, she began to take on promotional jobs at toy stores pretending to be Barbie.

Blondie said: 'People thought it was just a phase but I thought to myself as soon as I move out of home I'm going to turn myself into Barbie.

'My friends hated the attention I got from guys because of how I dressed. The told me to tone it down when I went out with them.

'I was forced to live a double life until about eight years ago when I decided to become Barbie for real and ignore what other people said.'

Last August, Blondie had her H cup implants increased to a JJ with 1700cc saline implants.

And in December she had chin liposuction to contour her face so she looked more like Barbie.

Blondie, 38, regularly uses Botox and lip fillers and is training herself to become 'dumb' like the doll she idolises

She said: 'Some other women pretend they are human Barbie dolls but I take it to the next level.

'I want people to see me as a plastic sex doll and being brainless is a big part of that.

'People can criticise me but this is who I am: I want my transformation to be head to toe, inside and out.'
