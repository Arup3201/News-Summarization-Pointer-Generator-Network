Adults are being urged to improve their maths as experts claim poor numeracy costs the economy more than £20billion a year.

Inability to cope with numbers results in lower wages, smaller company profits and reduced tax revenues for the Government, a charity warns today.

Millions of adults struggle with simple tasks they need in their jobs or everyday life, such as weighing ingredients, administering medicines and working out deals in shops, National Numeracy says.

Now, the organisation is urging Britons to take a 20-minute maths quiz after figures showed half the adult population has the numeracy ability of a primary school child.

They will be given a score and guided towards maths tuition to help them improve their result next time they take the challenge.

The Government-backed scheme is aimed at boosting the maths skills of at least one million adults over the next five years.

It coincided with new research from the Pro Bono Economics charity which pinpointed levels of poor numeracy and calculated the cost to the economy.

Karen Hancock, an economist with the charity, said: ‘The report begins with the finding that almost half the adult population has numeracy no greater than that expected of a child leaving primary school. For a developed country that’s pretty shocking.’

Poor maths skills were estimated to be costing the economy £20.2billion-a-year - 1.3 per cent of GDP. In fact, this was likely to be an underestimate since costs to the criminal justice system and NHS were difficult to quantify.

A separate poll of 2,300 adults found that more than a third - 36 per cent - felt they were being held back by their poor maths abilities, for example struggling to help with their children’s homework or trying to work out budgets and personal finances.

One in four said maths at school did not prepare them well for maths in everyday life.

Under the new initiative, anyone can check their maths skills through a new online quiz at www.nnchallenge.org.uk .

It takes 20 to 25 minutes and participants will be given a score out of 100 and one of four grades, with gold the top grade, meaning they are performing at GCSE C-grade level or above.

Silver is equivalent to grades D to G at GCSE, bronze is equivalent to the standard expected of a nine to 11-year-old, while ‘entry’ is the standard expected of children up to the age of eight.

Participants are then guided to free websites which will help them improve their skills at their own pace, before encouraging them to retake the test.

Mike Ellicock, chief executive of National Numeracy, said: ‘We want this to be the biggest ever drive across the UK to crack the problem of poor adult numeracy, a problem that has dogged us for decades.

‘We’re heartened by the extent to which we’ve got support from the DfE, from Elizabeth Truss and Matt Hancock and the Department for Business.’

He said poor maths skills were not because Britons lacked innate talent but a prevailing assumption that you can either do maths or you can’t.

It was ‘absolutely vital’ to explode what amounted to a ‘big talent myth’.

A range of public sector organisations and firms are backing the scheme and encouraging employees to take the quiz, including Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which described how it would help improve patient care.

‘If we can improve numeracy it will inevitably improve care for patients because so much of patient care is measured,’ said Paula Ward, assistant director of learning.

Staff needed maths for a range of tasks such as calculating dose and meal portion sizes, translating easily between stones and kilograms when talking about patients’ weights and calculating the correct concentration of cleaning products to keep bugs under control.

Mark Rennison, group finance director at Nationwide, which is backing the initiative, said: ‘We are confronted every day, through the distribution of financial products through our branch network with conversations with people who clearly are not comfortable [with numbers].

‘It is almost impossible to ask people to make buying decisions around financial products without resorting to numbers.’
