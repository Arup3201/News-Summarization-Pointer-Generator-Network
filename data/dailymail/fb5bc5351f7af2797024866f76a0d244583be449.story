Disturbing footage has emerged showing a moose jumping to its death in Sweden.

The elk was spotted looking confused and distressed in a shopping centre car park in Borlange, Dalarna County, Sweden, before it leapt over a high railing on to the road below.

The horrifying moment on Wednesday afternoon was caught on camera by a passing car.

Captured on camera: A passing car filmed the moment a moose jumped from the upper level of a shopping centre car park in Sweden

The animal had been spotted looking increasingly distressed in the car park in Borlange, Dalarna County, Sweden, before it jumped Wednesday afternoon

Big fall: The moose fell approximately eight metres on to the road below

Police were called to the scene but the moose died of its injuries from the fall, which was approximately eight metres. 

The animal is seen running towards the edge of the roof before flinging itself on to the pavement below.

At first it is able to stand, and even staggers forward for a couple of steps, before collapsing in the middle of the road.

It is not clear how the animal got into the upper level of the car park from where it jumped. 

An eyewitness told Liveleak.com: 'I was about to park my car when I saw the moose come jogging from the University. I saw how it disappeared between two posts and thought it ran down the stairs.'

The moose can be seen trying to stand up after its fall but its injuries were too severe

It is still unknown what prompted the animal to jump from the car park

Police were called to the scene but the animal died from its injuries

Distressing: It also remains unclear how the moose got into the car park in the first place
