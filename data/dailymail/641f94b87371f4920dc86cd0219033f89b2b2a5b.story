A woman was forced to jump into a canal to escape a dangerous serial sex attacker who threatened to kill her - but he will not serve a day for the crime. 

Ryan Lockyer, 22, of  Reading, Berkshire, was jailed for six years for the 'terrifying' attack, which left his 31-year-old victim afraid to go out alone.

Reading Crown Court heard the incident took place less than 18 months after Lockyer was released early from prison for an earlier series of sex attacks.

Lockyer stalked his victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, as she walked home from work on October 7, 2014. 

As she passed through a nature reserve near Fobney Lock in Reading, Berkshire, at around 3.45pm, the defendant began following her. 

When she noticed him he started to run towards her shouting: 'I have a knife and I will kill you.'

Prosecutor Walton Hornsby said Lockyer, who was brandishing a 10cms long knife, grabbed the woman and told her: 'I will kill you if you don't do what I want you to do.'

Mr Hornsby said: 'She thought the only way to get away from him was to jump in the river.'

The woman then told Lockyer she would do whatever he wanted, which appeared to take him by surprise and gave her the chance to slip free from his grasp and jump into the canal.

Lockyer immediately ran off but the victim remained in the water for some time, scared he was still in the area.

The victim eventually returned home and reported the incident to police the following day, describing her attacker as looking like an actor from BBC drama The Tudors.

Lockyer was arrested after being picked out of an identity parade on October 10 and he was charged the next day.

He gave a no comment during his interview but at a court hearing on January 7 he admitted a charge of making threats to kill, committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence and threatening with a bladed article.

In a victim impact statement the woman described how she now takes the bus everywhere rather than walking alone and sees a potential attacker in every man she encounters.

After his arrest Lockyer was recalled to prison to serve the rest of his previous licence period. 

That sentence related to a hearing at Oxford Crown Court in 2011 when, aged 18 years, Lockyer was jailed for four years with a three-year licence for sexual assault, three counts of sexual activity with a child and causing actual bodily harm.

'This was, without question, a terrifying experience for your victim,' Judge John told Lockyer, who appeared via video link from HMP Bullingdon. 

The judge then blasted Parliament for laws which meant he could not jail Lockyer for longer than his prison recall for the previous sex attacks, meaning he will 'literally not serve a day' behind bars for the latest offence.

'That is a consequence which, I feel bound to say, I deplore but about which I can do nothing,' Judge Stephen John told Lockyer as he sentenced him via video link at Reading Crown Court.

Judge Stephen John described Lockyer as 'one of the more dangerous men' he had come across during his lengthy career, saying it was a 'chilling' case.

Judge John said the defendant had an 'alarming' history and said he was plainly a danger to the public.

However, the judge said that because of laws introduced in 2003 and the fact that Lockyer would be released halfway through his latest sentence, he would effectively not serve a day behind bars for the canal attack.

'Apart from the effect of your recall, you will be entitled to release from the sentence I now impose at the halfway point, thus three years from today, which would be March 9, 2018,' said Judge John.

'Because of the licence recall, you will not be released until May 13, 2018, a mere seven weeks later.

'Because Parliament in its wisdom chose in 2003 to abolish the power to return a prisoner to custody to serve the unexpired portion of licence and then to order the fresh sentence to run consecutively to that recall, the effect of my order is that you will literally not serve a day longer for the offences for which you are now sentenced.'

When he is released, Lockyer will remain on licence for 10 years.

In mitigation, Peter De Feu said: 'As far as this offending goes and this very brave victim, he is sorry.

'He is still young and young enough perhaps for there to be a hope of change.'

Lockyer was jailed for six years for making threats to kill and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence.

He will serve a two year sentence for threatening with a bladed article concurrently.

He was also handed an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order, having already been given a 10-year order in 2011.
