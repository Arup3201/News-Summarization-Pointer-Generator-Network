Tennis fans are set to enjoy more beautiful weather at Wimbledon today, hours after thousands watched Andy Murray claim victory in glorious sunshine.

The British No 1's supporters sat on Murray Mound on the first day of the competition in south-west London yesterday after a 25C (77F) weekend.

Forecasters predict that the weather will remain sunny and warm for the next two days - which is good news for those wanting to watch plenty of tennis.

Temperatures are expected to hit 24C (75F) in Britain today, with some showers expected in parts of East Anglia - although none are forecast for SW19.

However, more widespread showers are expected by Thursday, just in time for the traditionally-wet Glastonbury music festival in Pilton, Somerset.

Scores of tennis fans continued to 
queue outside the All England Club yesterday in a bid to get tickets 
while sun-seekers once again took to beaches.

Sunday
 saw 50,000 people fill the seven-mile beach at Bournemouth, Dorset, and
 it was even pleasant in the waves with 15C (59F) water temperatures.

Met Office spokesman Nicola Maxey said the warm weather was expected to continue for the next few days.

She
 said: 'There is likely to be a bit of a change as we head towards the 
end of the week, so it's likely to become a little bit more unsettled.'

Temperatures remained at 21C in Wimbledon yesterday, but tennis fans won't be able to leave their umbrellas at home all week.

The
 weather is expected to turn wet on Thursday, with showers rolling in 
and the balmy conditions all but gone by the weekend.

That means music 
fans at the Glastonbury Festival, which runs from tomorrow to Sunday, 
could be in for a rather muddy finale.

Wimbledon watchers however won't be able to leave their umbrellas at home all week, with showers expected to roll in by Thursday

Despite
 the best start to summer since 2006, some residents spotted council gritters 
apparently salting the roads in one rural village.

The
 gritters were spotted out on patrol on country lanes in St Kew near 
Wadebridge in Cornwall, despite top temperatures in the county reaching 
20.8C.

However, rather 
than salting the roads the trucks were in fact spraying sand to prevent 
the road surface from melting in the heat. 

Peter Glaser, 62, found himself travelling behind the truck for almost half a mile as it sprayed a fine grit on the road.

The unusual spectacle took place on Saturday afternoon on a country lane between St Tudy and St Kew in Cornwall.

Mr Glaser, from St Breward, said: 'I 
couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was a gritter lorry and you could
 see the spreader, releasing the fine grit.

Tennis fans were up bright and early in the hope of watching Andy Murray begin his defence of the Wimbledon title yesterday

'I was gobsmacked, I just thought "my goodness what are they doing?" It's difficult enough to get them out on a cold day.

'There must have been a logical reason but it was beyond me.'

In
 Bournemouth, temperatures were already hitting the mid-twenties
 by mid-morning on Sunday.

Dozens of beachgoers struggled to find a spot on the
 stretch of golden sand as an estimated 50,000 people flocked
 to the coast.

Seaside
 staff hired out almost all of the 3,000 deckchairs and ice cream 
vendors were bombarded with 10-minute long queues.

Almost all of the town’s 200 hotels were reportedly nearing their capacity with the majority displaying ‘no vacancy’ signs.

Heather
 Smalling, from Bournemouth, who was making the most of the fine weather
 with husband Tim and children Archie, seven, and Emma, five, said it 
was better than being abroad.

The 37-year-old said: ‘Never mind Spain - when the weather is like this, why would you want to go anywhere else?

‘I feel sorry for all the people who have gone abroad during this spell of weather because there really is no better place than the UK right now.

‘This weather is glorious - it puts a smile on everyone’s faces, so long may it last.’
