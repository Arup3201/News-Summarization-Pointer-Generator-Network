Their smiles were almost as wide as the number on their winning cheque – £45,160,170.50p.

But as Matt Topham and girlfriend Cassey Carrington, both 22, toasted their huge Euromillions jackpot yesterday, one woman had rather different emotions.

It is understood that Mr Topham has been estranged from his mother Julie since the break-up of his parents’ marriage six years ago and the pair have not spoken since.

Delight: Miss Carrington, an Iceland supervisor, said she only set up an online Lottery account last Friday because she was feeling lucky

And last night the newly married Julie 
Gamble fought back tears as she said she hoped the massive jackpot did 
not ruin her son’s life.

Asked if she would be seeing her son, Mrs Gamble, 49, said: ‘That’s his choice at the end of the day, he knows where I am.’

She said she was ‘absolutely ecstatic’ for the painter and decorator and
Miss Carrington, an Iceland store supervisor, but added: ‘I hope they 
are as happy together after the win as they were before it.

‘I hope it changes their lives for the better. It’s a staggering amount.
From what I can gather they are very much in love, I know Cassey is 
Matt’s rock.’

Estranged: Euromillions winner Matt hasn't spoken to his mother Julie, pictured for six years

Mr Topham and Miss Carrington, from Stapleford, Nottingham, live just 20
miles from Gareth and Catherine Bull, who scooped a £40million 
Euromillions payout less than three weeks ago.

At a press conference yesterday the couple vowed to ‘look after our 
friends and family first’. Mr Topham works for his father Brian as a 
painter and decorator and made numerous references to him, along with 
his siblings, yesterday. But the lottery winner made no mention of his 
mother.

Last night it emerged that a tangled family background has seen Brian 
Topham leave Julie only to once more end up living with his first wife, 
Stepheny.

In a further twist, Brian and Stepheny Topham now live only 
five doors down from the home of Mrs Gamble and her husband Jason in 
Stapleford.

A relative said Matt Topham had lived with his mother in the aftermath 
of his parents’ divorce, but then decided to stay with his father.

Neighbours said Mr Topham’s sister, Samantha, 19, stayed with their 
mother, while his younger brother, Craig, lived with his father. Matt 
Topham and Miss Carrington live nearby in a two-bedroom ex-council house
they bought for £89,950 two years ago.

The couple, who said they owe their new-found fortune to a lucky dip 
ticket, now want to build their own home and plan to buy an Aston Martin
to replace their £7,000 Peugeot 107 city car.

Mr Topham said: ‘I have often painted these huge houses and wondered what it would be like to live in one. Now I can find out.’

A member of the Air Training Corps in his youth, he said he wanted to 
pay for flying lessons with his winnings in order to learn to fly 
‘helicopters and planes’.

Miss Carrington added that while they had no plans to move their 
September wedding reception from their existing, secret venue, or change
Miss Carrington’s ‘dream’ dress, they would be upgrading to a suite on 
their foreign honeymoon.

The win came days after she had won a share of a £10,000 bonus awarded 
to staff at her store in Eastwood, Nottingham. Miss Carrington said she 
would hand back her share, amounting to ‘a few hundred pounds’ for her 
old colleagues to share between them.

She had worked at the store since leaving school and supervised 20 
staff. A former colleague at the branch said they were ‘really made up 
for her’.

Miss Carrington said that, ‘feeling lucky’ after winning the bonus 
money, she went home and set up an online National Lottery account. She 
won with the only ticket she bought for Tuesday’s draw using the 
account.

The couple feared their luck had changed on the day of the draw, when 
their computer and washing machine both broke down within hours of each 
other.

Mr Topham was surfing the internet to look for replacement parts for the
machines when his girlfriend checked her smartphone and discovered 
their numbers had come up. The winning numbers were 3, 15, 17, 28 and 
33, and the lucky star numbers were 2 and 4.

The couple met three-and-a-half years ago after being introduced by a 
mutual friend during a night out. Mr Topham said that within three weeks
‘we were already planning our future’, and they became engaged last 
June.

Last night his father Brian said: ‘We’re really happy for them. It 
couldn’t have happened to nicer people, they’re a lovely couple. He rang
to tell me. I believed him straight away because we don’t tell lies in 
this house.’

The win is the seventh biggest British lottery win, and makes the pair the ninth UK Euromillions winners in the past year alone.

There have now been 22 UK winners since the nine-country European draw was launched in 2004.

Big bucks: Hugh Grant is worth £45million, according to The Sunday Times Rich List

The £45million jackpot makes Matt Topham and Cassey Carrington as rich as actor Hugh Grant, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

But it still leaves them quite some way behind other big UK winners.

The biggest-ever EuroMillions prize in the UK went to Ayrshire couple Colin and Christine Weir who won £161million in July last year, making them almost as wealthy as the Beckhams.

Another anonymous ticket holder collected £113m, while Dave and Angela Dawes, from Cambridgeshire, scooped £101m in October.

The fourth-biggest EuroMillions prize winner in the UK collected £84million in May 2010. They chose to keep their identity secret.

In February 2010, Nigel Page and Justine Laycock, from Gloucestershire, broke the then record with a £56million win – now the fifth-biggest prize in the history of EuroMillions.

The sixth-biggest payout went to Les and Sam Scadding in South Wales who won £45millon in November 2009.

Mansfield
couple Gareth and Catherine Bull, who vowed to buy a box at 
Manchester United and a new carpet respectively after last month's 
£41million win, have been knocked into eighth place by the new jackpot.
