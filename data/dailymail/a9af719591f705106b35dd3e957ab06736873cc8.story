Twenty leading businessmen today warned that if Britain does not stay at the heart of Europe, three million jobs could be lost.

Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson and 
British Telecom chairman Sir Mike Rake were among the leading business 
figures who urged the Government to seize opportunities to 're-engage in
the decision-making process' in the European Union.

They argued that Europe's future was 
vital to Britain's economic interests and said it was imperative the 
country was not outside the euro when important decisions are taken.

Re-engagement: The businessmen argued that the EU's single market is 'of great importance' to the UK

It is feared that 3 million British jobs which rely on exports to European partners could be at risk

The businessmen are all signatories of a 
letter sent to the Telegraph newspaper, published today. Their 
intervention comes 10 days after David Cameron vetoed EU treaty reforms.

The businessmen wrote: 'The Government estimates that three million British jobs rely on exports to our European partners.

'The EU's institutions, from the 
commission to the European Court of Justice, exist mainly to safeguard 
the single market's level playing field.

'Protecting the single market has to be the bedrock of our re-engagement with Europe.'

Wealth creators: Sir Martin Sorrel, chief executive of advertising group WPP, also signed the letter

Global effort: European countries agreed to provide 150 billion euros - £125 billion - to the International Monetary Fund

The wealth creators also argue that it is in Britain's interest for the Euro to survive, and that the EU's single market is 'of great importance' to the UK.

They added: 'We therefore 
should do everything we can to ensure the necessary steps are taken to 
guarantee its viability.

'The EU’s single market, while not complete, is of great importance to 
Britain. It accounts for over half our trade, but we must deepen and 
widen it, and push for reform in services, telecoms, the digital arena 
and energy.

'It accounts for over half our trade, but we must deepen and widen it, and push for reform in services, telecoms, the digital arena and energy.

'It
is imperative that we are not outside when important decisions are 
taken, and as opportunities arise over the coming months for Britain to 
re-engage in the decision-making process in Europe, we must seize them.'

Among the other signatories are Sir 
Martin Sorrel, chief executive of advertising group WPP, Roland Rudd, 
the chairman of Business for New Europe, former EU trade commissioner 
Lord Brittan, and Sir Stephen Wall, Tony Blair's former adviser on 
Europe.

European countries yesterday agreed to provide 150 billion euros (£125 billion) to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

But
Britain's decision not to take part in a scheme to support the 
struggling eurozone meant EU finance ministers failed to reach their 
target of 200 billion euros.

Britain
has made clear that it will not be part of any effort intended 
specifically for the eurozone, but is ready to consider participating in
a global effort to boost IMF resources at a meeting of the G20 group of
major economies in Mexico in January.

A
Treasury spokesman said: 'The UK has always been willing to consider 
further resources for the IMF, but for its global role and as part of a 
global agreement.'
