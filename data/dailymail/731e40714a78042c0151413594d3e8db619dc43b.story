Liverpool are struggling to agree a new contract with Raheem Sterling as the impact of their Champions League exit takes effect.

The Reds have made an informal offer of a five year deal worth up to £70,000 to Sterling. But a deal is yet to be agreed as Sterling weighs up his future.

The England international is one of the premier prospects in world football, with Europe's superpowers - Real Madrid among them - watching developments over his contract situation closely.

Sterling is understandably keen to continue playing in the Champions League. Liverpool, as it stands, look way off qualifying for next season's Champions League.

The weekend's clash against Manchester United is likely to provide a major indication of how competitive Liverpool can be in the top-flight for the next season.

Liverpool and Sterling, who is currently on £25,000 per week, remain optimistic that a deal can be reached as talks continue.

But the next few weeks could prove critical in deciding Sterling's future.
