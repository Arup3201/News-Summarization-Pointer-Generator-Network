Police have unearthed a cache of weapons and pipe bombs at the home of a New York City emergency technician while responding to a call about a domestic dispute.

Victor Cadicamo, a 29-year-old EMT for the city's fire department, has been charged with 
criminal possession of a weapon, harassment and menacing after a row with his wife on Thursday.

His wife, Christina Liskowitz - herself a Fire Department EMT - called police to their Brooklyn home at 9.10am, saying that her husband had threatened her with a gun.

Their two-year-old child was allegedly in the house when their fight started.

Busted: Victor Cadicamo, 29, allegedly had two pipe bombs, five firearms and a rifle hidden at his Brooklyn home

Officers arrived and searched for the gun he had allegedly threatened her with and came across five firearms and a rifle hidden in the living room and 
bedroom, the New York Daily News reported.

Cadicamo was taken to the police station for questioning and admitted to having two pipe bombs at the home. After a search, a bomb squad located the explosives on Thursday afternoon.

The
bomb squad removed the explosives from the Brighton Beach house 
and dismantled them at Rodmans Neck firing range as a precaution. It 
wasn’t clear if the pipe bombs were live.

The other weapons were also 
confiscated.

Stash: Cadicamo shared this image on his Facebook page, writing beneath the picture: 'Lol if you saw what I've got in my apartment you'd be shocked'

Fight: The home was searched after his wife, Christina Liskowitz, called 911 and claimed he was threatening her with a gun. Their two-year-old child was in the home at the time of the dispute

As well as criminal charges, Cadicamo, who has worked as an EMT for six years, could lose his job, but union officials said it was too early to comment on his future at the service.

Neighbors told the Daily News that they often heard the couple fighting and that Cadicamo had boasted about having guns in his apartment.

'I can’t believe he has a bomb,' Neighbor Yasir Ullah said. 'He is a nice guy. I cannot believe this.'

An image taken several years ago and posted on Facebook shows Cadicamo posing with a selection of guns in what he identifies as his bedroom.

Uncertain future: He was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, menacing and harassment and his future at the Fire Department is unknown. He has worked as an EMT for six years

'Lol if you saw what I've got in my apartment you'd be shocked,' he wrote beneath the picture.

Cadicamo has been charged with criminal possession of a weapon, menacing and harassment, but he has not yet been charged for possessing the explosives.

The FDNY have not yet responded to a request for comment.
