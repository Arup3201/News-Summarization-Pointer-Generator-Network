Curt Warburton admits he still has regrets over his split-decision defeat to Stevie Ray in June.

The former UFC fighter lost his rematch with the Scotsman and missed out on the chance to win the Cage Warriors lightweight title.

But, as he explains, the County Durham man is confident he can settle the score once and for all.
