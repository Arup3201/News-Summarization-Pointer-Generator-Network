The number of unaccompanied minors under the age of 12 coming to the U.S. has risen 117 percent in the last fiscal year, a new report shows.

Data released by the Pew Research Center today reveals that the percentage of pre-teens crossing the border alone has nearly doubled since last fiscal year, rising from 9 percent to 16 percent.

'The big message here is that when looking at who is crossing the 
U.S.-Mexico border and being apprehended, a growing number are young 
children,' Pew’s director of Hispanic research, Mark Hugo Lopez, told 
ABC News.

Pew 
obtained the previously unreported data from the U.S. Customs and Border
 Protection agency through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Guatemalan children caught in Mexico while trying to migrate illegally into the United States queue before climbing into a minibus at Aurora international airport in Guatemala City on July 14, 2014 after being deported from Mexico. New data shows that an increasingly larger share of unaccompanied minors coming to the U.S. are under the age of 12

Children under the age of 12 make up a greater percentage of unaccompanied minors illegally immigrating to the U.S. than last fiscal year. The number has increased 117 percent since last fiscal year

The
 data for this year only goes through the end of May, whereas the fiscal
 year runs from October to the end of September. Meaning, the year over 
year increase will be even higher when the final numbers come in this 
fall.

According to Pew, number of 
pre-teens traveling without their parents were taken into custody at the
 U.S. border with Mexico had reached 6,675 by the end of May compared to 3,162 who 
were apprehended the fiscal year before.

Children
 coming from Honduras account for the largest percentage of the 
increase, followed by El Salvador and Guatemala. The number of young, Mexican children trying to enter the country stayed the same.

Only 3 percent of of Mexican children who are caught trying to cross the border are under the age of 12, while 27 percent are from Honduras - a 7 percent increase from last year. Another 22 percent are from El Salvador - a 5 percent increase from 2013 - and 10 percent are from Guatemala - a 5 percent increase.

'While this data does not tell us why [Honduras is sending more 
youth], one possible reason, according to Department of Homeland 
Security, is the growing level of violence in Honduras,' Lopez said.

'Today, Honduras has the world’s highest murder rate, and San Pedro 
Sula, where the single largest contingent of kids from Honduras are 
from, is the world’s murder capital.'

Not coincidentally, El Salvador has the fourth highest homicide rate and Guatemala is immediately behind it, according to the United Nations.

The three countries make up the largest influx of children illegally immigrating to the U.S.

The largest influx of unaccompanied minors under the age of 12 has come from Honduras, which not coincidentally has the highest per person murder rate in the world

A total of 57,525 unaccompanied minors have been apprehended at the border as of last month, whereas 38,759 were taken into custody all of last fiscal year.

The deluge of children has over inundated law enforcement officials at the border and has the president seeking $3.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress for federal agencies who handle illegal immigration.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said 'preliminary data' from Border Patrol shows that the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border per day subsided in the last month, decreasing from 350 a day to 150 in the Rio Grande Valley area.

'Now, while the reasons for the reduction in the number of unaccompanied children and adults traveling with children apprehended by CBP cannot be attributed to any one factor,' Earnest said, 'we do believe that the administration’s response and efforts to work with Central American leaders to publicize the dangers of the journey and reinforce that apprehended migrants are ultimately returned to their home countries, in keeping with the law, as well as seasonal flows, have all played a part.'

Even with the slow down in apprehensions, officials say the U.S. could still run out of money to process the influx of unaccompanied children and families arriving at the border before the end of year.

The number of minors accompanied by a 
parent entering the U.S. illegally has also risen at a sharp rate in the
 last year, increasing by 160 percent.

So for, 22,069 accompanied 
children have been taken into custody, up from just 8,479 last fiscal year. Of that group, 81 percent are younger than 12.
