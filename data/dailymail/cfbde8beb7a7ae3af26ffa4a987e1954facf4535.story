Two days after contemplating calling time on his Australian Open campaign, a rejuvenated Rafael Nadal surged into the fourth round in Melbourne on Friday.

Nadal came close to retiring from his second round match with Tim Smyczek due to nausea and dizziness, the nine-time French Open champion eventually recovering from two sets to one down to avoid a first ever defeat to a qualifier in a grand slam.

The 28-year-old was back on Rod Laver Arena 48 hours later and enjoyed a far more pleasant experience, beating Israel's Dudi Sela 6-1 6-0 7-5 to set up a last-16 clash with big-serving South African Kevin Anderson.

'I started playing well with not many mistakes and Dudi was making more than usual in the first two sets, but I was playing much better than the other day,' said Nadal, who saw his great rival Roger Federer suffer a shock exit at the hands of Italy's Andreas Seppi earlier in the day.

'I was feeling the ball better with the forehand, changing direction down the line. In the third set he had some chances and I was lucky at the end of the third.

'The other night was one of the toughest moments I have spent on court. My body was not in good condition, I felt I was very lucky to be through. I thought at 2-1 down I was going to have to take the plane and go back to Majorca.'

Nadal told on-court interviewer Jim Courier that a lot of sleep had been the key to his recovery, but added: 'I don't like to sleep a lot. I feel when I am sleeping I am losing time.

'(But) I have to this time, to be relaxed and try to rest a little bit. It's a big thing for me to be in the fourth round of the Australian Open after not having much chance to be on the tour. Kevin has a big serve and is a dangerous player.'

Local favourite Nick Kyrgios has been spared playing Federer and will face Andreas Seppi next

Federer's defeat means Seppi will take on Australian Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round, with the winner to face either Andy Murray or Grigor Dimitrov in the quarter-finals.

Kyrgios battled a bad back and a nosebleed to beat Tunisia's Malek Jaziri in straight sets and was less taken aback than everyone else by the identity of his next opponent.

'I wasn't like really surprised,' the world number 53 said. 'I knew Seppi is capable of playing that sort of tennis, to beat some of the top guys. I don't think Roger played too bad at all. It was a tough match.

'Obviously I'd rather play Seppi than Federer, of course. But I know it's going to be a really tough match in a couple days. I played him (Seppi) once at the US Open. That was a really, really tough match. I probably played the best tennis I played in my life (winning in straight sets). I need to be ready again.'

Dimitrov twice recovered from a set down to beat Marcos Baghdatis 4-6 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-3 in a match lasting three hours and 28 minutes and played in a raucous atmosphere on court No 3 at Melbourne Park.

Dimitrov, who ended Murray's Wimbledon title defence in the quarter-finals last year, said: 'Obviously it was a tough game for me. I didn't really feel comfortable on the court. I thought Marcos was playing dominating tennis early on in the match. I wasn't really able to turn things around as fast as I wanted to.

'I felt quite good physically, which was I think the best sign for me today. I'm not going to hide my excitement of winning the match because it meant a lot to me. To be able to play three and a half hours and win 6-3 in the fifth and feeling really good after the match physically, that says a lot for me.'

Dimitrov was joined in the fourth round by Tomas Berdych, the seventh seed defeating Serbia's Viktor Troicki 6-4 6-3 6-4. Berdych will face Bernard Tomic in the last 16 after Tomic won an all-Australian clash with Sam Groth.
