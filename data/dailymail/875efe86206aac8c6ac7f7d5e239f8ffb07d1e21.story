A mother has claimed that staff at a Logan's Roadhouse kicked her out of a wedding reception meal for breastfeeding her baby daughter.

Patricia Varner was at a party in the McDonough, Georgia, outlet of the eatery when she stopped to feed her nine-week-old child - and was allegedly hounded out of the restaurant.

According to Varner, first a waitress then a manager started haranguing her to stop after she sat down in a secluded booth and fed the baby girl underneath a blanket.

Complaint: Patricia Varner says she was thrown out of the Logan's Roadhouse in McDonough, Georgia

Baby: Her daughter, whose name Varner did not give, was allegedly being fed discreetly when management intervened

She told local news station KCTV that staff told her she had to go because other customers were complaining.

The mother told her she was rushed out the door into the rain before she could get her husband the baby's car seat or even a coach to her, and was followed around the restaurant by a manager when she refused.

She said: 'I had no car seat, no coat for her or anything, and he insisted that I leave his restaurant. And I said, I refuse. He just continued to go on until I went to go find my husband.'

Family: Varner said they were kicked out of the restaurant before her husband Devon, left, could reach them

According to a scathing review of the restaurant Varner posted on Facebook, there were plenty of free places for other customers when she was asked to leave, and felt 'disrespected' as a result of her treatment.

Varner wrote: 'There were 8 other empty booths and 3 empty tables that my husband counted. However, I was asked to stop nursing and get up from the booth.

'...We were there with a large party after a wedding and it ruined the whole occasion! I have never in my life been so disrespected while nursing my children.

'We will never eat at any Logan's Roadhouse again and I will tell our story every chance we get.'

However, a spokesman for Logan's Roadhouse said that Varner's story is untrue and that the restaurant did its best to make her comfortable.

A statement said: 'When we learned about Ms. Varner’s complaint, we immediately looked into it, and interviewed team members in the restaurant.

'We have not found any evidence that she was treated unfairly. In fact, we believe that efforts were made to accommodate her.'

The statement continues to explain that the restaurant complies with all state laws on breastfeeding. 

This includes a section of the Georgia code which calls breastfeeding 'an important and basic act of nurture'.

The legislation adds that a woman is allowed to breastfeed a child anywhere she is ordinarily allowed to be.

Logan's Roadhouse has yet to respond to specific questions from DailyMail.com about the incident.
