The three children who died after their canoe overturned were not wearing life jackets, it emerged yesterday.

Grace Mackay, five, also known as Gracie, Ewen Beaton, five, and his brother Jamie, two, all died after their Canadian canoe sank at Loch Gairloch, off the Scottish Highlands.

Grace's eight-year-old sister Callie survived – managing to swim to shore with her father Garry, 35, after the accident on Sunday.

She was only told yesterday that her younger sister had drowned in the tragedy.

Police are still looking for the boys' father Ewen Fraser Beaton, 32, who was still missing yesterday despite extensive searches, and is feared dead.

Grace was found floating face down in the water and later died in hospital.

Callie's grandfather John Mackay told The Daily Telegraph that the grief-stricken family had gathered at her parents home in Muir of Ord, outside Inverness, yesterday to break the news to Callie.

He said the family wanted to be together to tell her that her sister - who she was inseparable from - had passed away.

Mr Mackay said the whole family were 'in a hell of a state' after learning the news that Grace, despite being raced to hospital after she was found face down in the water, had not survived.

He was at her bedside with his son and Grace's mother Wendy Macdonald when they learned the news.

'We had a fair idea when we arrived at the hospital that she was in trouble but we held on to a little bit of hope that she would pull through,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

He said that the two men - who were reported to be great friends and had been on numerous fishing trips - knew what they were doing and the family outing had turned into a tragedy, the Daily Telegraph reported.

In a statement, Grace's family said 
yesterday: 'Grace was a funny, caring, thoughtful daughter and 
granddaughter, full of life who loved animals and being outdoors.

'She 
adored her family and was our beautiful angel. We are devastated by the 
loss of our best friend.'

The Beatons, from near Beauly, and the
 Mackays, from Muir of Ord, near Inverness, were on a day trip and had 
been camping in a wigwam before going out in a canoe they had brought 
with them.

After the craft overturned, Callie and Garry Mackay, 35, managed to alert the coastguard when they reached the shore.

Stornoway Coastguard yesterday 
confirmed that Mr Mackay and Mr Beaton were not wearing any kind of 
protective clothing when the boat sank.

Mr Mackay was found by a local 
resident, Jim Aaron, on the shore with his shirt in his hand.

The children had all been wearing 
buoyancy aids. Similar to a waistcoat but with foam inside, they are 
designed to help keep the wearer afloat.

But, unlike life jackets, they 
will not keep the wearer's head above water if they fall unconscious.

The RNLI said yesterday that while 
buoyancy aids might be enough in certain circumstances, such as in 
supervised situations or calm waters, life jackets offer the best chance
 of survival.

A spokesman said: 'The tragic events 
in Scotland at the weekend have deeply saddened everyone in the RNLI and
 our thoughts go out to the family and friends of those whose lives were
 lost.

'The sea can be very unpredictable at 
times and there will always be an element of risk in going afloat, but 
in our view a life jacket, or some form of personal flotation device 
appropriate to the activity, offers the best chance of survival in the 
event of difficulties.'

'Beautiful angel': Grace's family released a statement expressing their sorrow over the loss of their 'best friend'.

Tracy Sinclair, head of Tarradale 
Primary School, Muir of Ord, where both Grace and Callie were pupils, 
said yesterday: 'Gracie was a happy, thoughtful little girl who was 
popular and well liked by everybody.

'This has come as a shock to the whole school community and we are all deeply saddened.'

It is understood the two adults were not wearing lifejackets and that Mr Beaton failed to surface after the boat capsized.

The cause of the catastrophe was also under investigation.

A friend spoke of how the distraught 
father came to pick up his mother, JulieAnn Mackay, and sister Michelle 
from their home in Inverness to drive to Gracie’s bedside at the Royal 
Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.

The friend said: ‘Garry was very
 upset and I asked him what happened. He said he didn’t know. One minute
 they were in the canoe, the next minute it had capsized.

'Within seconds, the kids had floated away from him and he couldn’t reach them.

‘Callie was closest to him and he 
managed to reach her and they both swam ashore to get help.

'We just 
can’t believe how a pleasant Sunday afternoon can go so badly wrong. It 
was only a couple of days ago that the kids were playing in my garden.’

Two weeks ago, Gracie had started at Tarradale Primary School where Callie is also a pupil.

Local resident, Jim Aaron, 70, relived
 the moment a terrified Mr Mackay raced into his back garden around 
4.15pm on Sunday and screamed for help to save his younger daughter.

‘He just appeared out of nowhere in a frantic state, panicking, in tears,’ said Mr Aaron.

‘He said he needed help, people had gone into the water. He was on his knees on the ground with his head in his hands.

‘He told me he was in the canoe when 
it tipped over and he saw his friend go under. The children were holding
 onto the other man when he just went under.’

Mr Mackay and Callie 
appear to have become separated after reaching the shore when Mr Mackay 
went for help.

Mr Aaron described how he searched increasingly frantic 
Mr Mackay until Callie was found – in shock and shivering after swimming
 in the freezing water.

James Cameron, 34, who co-runs the Big Sands campsite, discovered Gracie face down in the water and unconscious.

‘She had her buoyancy aid on,’ he said. ‘It was keeping her afloat but it wasn’t keeping her head out the water.’

Callie’s step-grandmother, Pennie 
Macdonald, of Dingwall, said: ‘Callie is a very keen and strong swimmer.
 She took lessons at the school and I’m not surprised she managed to 
swim to shore.

‘The girls were like twins, they were inseparable and Callie will be lost without her sister.’

Peter Godding, coastguard sector 
manager, said of Callie: ‘It’s amazing really, she swam quite a long way
 in the sea. It’s pretty incredible that she did survive.

‘She is very courageous and very resourceful to be able to complete a 500metre swim to shore.

Speaking about the type of canoe the 
group had been in, he said: ‘They are quite cheap vessels to purchase 
and unfortunately it’s quite difficult to maintain the stability if you 
stand up in them.’

He described the search for Mr Beaton, which was stood down yesterday, as ‘extensive’.

Mr Godding said: ‘He has been in the 
water a very long time, if he is still in the water. We have extensively
 completed a set of criteria which terminates the search.’

The Beaton family lived in Beauly, ten
 miles west of Inverness. Five-year-old Ewen Beaton attended Teanassie 
Primary School, near Beauly.

His brother was due to start nursery at the 61-pupil school at the end of the year.

James Martin, chairman of the school’s parent council, said: ‘The school community is devastated by this tragic news.

‘The Beatons are a well-known and highly respected family and the impact of their loss will be felt throughout the community.’
