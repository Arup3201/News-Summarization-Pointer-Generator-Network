Tourism bosses are to use the birth of Prince George of Cambridge to present Britain as a family friendly holiday destination.

VisitBritain released the first poster which will be used in the campaign to target 21 key markets around the world.

They hope to build on the £500million annual boost the royal family brings to the economy, after images of the royal baby were beamed around the world.

The new campaign will feature the slogan ‘welcome to Great Britain’ over an iconic image of William and Kate with their new son, named George Alexander Louis, on the steps of St Mary’s hospital.

The poster adds: ‘Many congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the birth of their baby boy.’

The image will be used in online and print campaigns around the world, after VisitBritain chief executive Sandy Dawe said the arrival of the royal baby ‘gives us chance to promote family-friendly Britain’.

Key countries to be targeted include USA, Canada, Brazil, Australia, China, Japan, India, UAE, Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Poland, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway  and Russia.

News of the royal birth has made headlines around the world, with images of the Duke and Duchess dominating front pages in many of the countries targeted by tourism agencies.

Within hours of the birth Visit Britain began highlighting parts of the UK with links to the couple in an attempt to encourage visitors to book holidays days to areas with royal connections.

It included promoting Norfolk, because Anmer Hall, a few miles east of the Queen’s grand Norfolk estate, Sandringham, will be William and Kate’s new country retreat.

Other areas with William and Kate connections including Eton, where he went to school, St Andrews university in Edinburgh where they met as students and the Welsh island of Anglesey where they live while Williiam served as a pilot.

A VisitBritain spokesman said: ‘William and Kate have really given us a great romance of Britain – meeting at St Andrews, living on Anglesey and now preparing for life at Kensington Palace and in Norfolk.

‘With the birth of the Prince of Cambridge, we’re looking to highlight Britain globally as a great family destination, with plenty of kid friendly activities as well as plenty for older generations to enjoy.’

Three years ago a study by VisitBritain suggested Britain’s Monarchy generated well over £500 million a year from overseas tourists.

But since then the royals’ global profile has soared through Kate and William’s wedding, the Diamond Jubilee, the Queen’s appearance in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics and now the royal baby.

Branding agency Brand Finance this week suggested the new royal prince could bolster the British economy by £521million.

It claimed short-term boosts like souvenirs, memorabilia, food and drink sales combined with longer-term benefits including sales of pushchairs and clothing, will rake in millions alongside a wider sense of consumer confidence.

David Haigh, chief executive of Brand Finance, said: ‘The monarchy is one of the most valuable of all British brands. Whatever one thinks about the constitutional principle, there seems little doubt that the institution of Monarchy adds significant annual earnings and long term economic value to the UK.

‘The Monarchy is a powerful endorsement for individual and company brands and the latest Windsor will be an effective and lucrative ambassador for Brand Britain, making a significant contribution to the task of driving Britain out of the recession.’
