A  committee of MPs has called on the Government to do more to stop citizens being duped by the 'copycat' sites which are charging for services (file picture)

Motorists have been warned to be wary of copycat government websites which are charging users for services that are normally free.

Unofficial websites which have been described as 'impersonators' have led to drivers paying extra for services such as applying for a driving test or driving licences or paying the congestion charge.

A cross-party committee of MPs has now called on the Government to do more to stop citizens being duped by the 'copycat' sites.

The Transport Select Committee said efforts were needed across Whitehall to tackle the problem, with search engines such as Google being alerted to problem websites.

The committee's Labour chairwoman Louise Ellman said the Government 'must do more to warn motorists' about the misleading sites.

The report looked into the work of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) and the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA).

The AA told the committee it had seen an increase in complaints about 'impersonator websites' charging for services such as applying for a driving test or driving licences.

The committee's report said that in written evidence to the committee, the motoring organisation recognised there was a case for services that added value such as 'checking services' or 'fast track services'.

But it said the Government agencies appeared to co-exist with alternative, unofficial 'service providers'. 

The AA thought it 'almost immoral that (such sites) can ply a trade that basically tricks people'.'

In the capital, Transport for London (TfL) had asked the DVLA to send letters to drivers who had used an unofficial website to pay the congestion charge.

TfL is also consulting on a proposal that it should refuse to accept payments from copycat websites or other unauthorised third-parties, the report said.

The committee noted that the problem goes beyond the Department for Transport, with the Government Digital Service (GDS) leading efforts to address the issue.

The MPs heard that GDS tracks the activity of such sites and shares this information with Google, and other search engines, so they can identify and take action against 'websites that add little or no value to existing online Government services'.

The National Trading Standards Board has also received an additional £120,000 in funding to 'clamp down on misleading websites'.

The committee said the problems on the first day of the paperless car tax system, which descended into chaos with the DVLA website struggling with the demand, were an indication of the challenges facing the Government in moving services online.

Ms Ellman said: 'DVLA and DVSA are important for delivering essential services related to tax, licensing, testing, and vehicle safety.

'The Department for Transport must ensure that its current re-organisation programme for these agencies delivers high quality services that benefit everyone.

'The recent problems experienced by motorists when road tax renewal went online demonstrates the importance of responding to change, having clear communication with the public and an effective contingency plan to maintain confidence

'We welcome greater information sharing across the motoring agencies and the expansion of online services that we found were well-liked by many customers.

'However, the motoring agencies must continue to meet the needs of those customers who can't access or use digital services.

'Linked to this the Government must do more to warn motorists about misleading 'copycat' websites that charge for services provided for free by motoring agencies.

'We also call on DVLA to do more to explain the legal basis for the sharing of personal data with organisations engaged in parking enforcement and the steps it takes to deal with private parking companies caught misusing personal data supplied by the motoring agencies.'

Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: 'David Cameron's incompetent Government has presided over digital tax disc chaos, delays to driving tests and rip-off copycat websites.

'Drivers deserve better, and this report is clear that ministers need to stamp out copycat websites and ensure motoring agencies have the tools they need to keep rogues off our roads.'
