Welcome to the New York rat-race, where actual rodents join the daily grind.

Commuter Jinais Ponnampadikkal Kader filmed the hilarious moment all hell broke loose when a rat boarded a Brooklyn-bound train at Fulton Street station in Manhattan yesterday morning.

The footage, posted on YouTube, shows adults clambering on top of the seats and shrieking 'Oh my God' as the big rat darted through the car for more than two minutes before the doors re-opened.

The offender: YouTube footage shows this giant rat scampering through a Brooklyn-bound train car this morning

On the loose: This rat scampered onto the train at Fulton Street Station in New York City and spent about two minutes running through the car before the doors opened again

Alarmed: Footage shows dozens of trapped commuters standing on seats to avoid the giant rat

Some 
brave passengers stayed seated but lifted their legs as the rodent ran
by, while others jumped to avoid the furry creature.

In his online post, Kader wrote: 'A usually boring Monday morning commute to work at Brooklyn was stirred up by this little guy.

'He joined us at the Fulton street station on the A train going downtown. Someone getting off the train was screaming "RAT on the train!".

'But by the time everyone realized what was happening, the doors closed and the train entered the tunnel. We were stuck with him till the other end.'

It's not clear where - or if - the rat got off the subway car.

Scared to death: One well-dressed commuter jumped in fear as the hideous rodent raced past his feet

Frightened: Commuters were quick to jump on their seats to avoid the giant rat as it ducked and weaved through the aisle and around the train poles

While New York's train tracks are covered with rats and mice, it is more unusual to find them on the train.

NBC New York
 reported New York state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) 
has budgeted $1.1 million this year on rat eradication and control 
programs. 

These 
include a federally-funded sterilization project, rat poison on 
train tracks, and efforts to seal the doors of the 347 'refuse rooms' in
 
the five boroughs.

Yesterday's icky footage follows news that a mouse was spotted at Manhattan's famous Cronut bakery on the same day that Dunkin' Donuts was shut down for a rat infestation last week (see video below).
