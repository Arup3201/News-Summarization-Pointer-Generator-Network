After one of the great diplomatic custard pies of our age – an incident which makes Prince Philip look like Boutros Boutros-Ghali – the Franco-British summit repaired to an Oxfordshire pub.

Barman, a pint of neat gin for my French pal, please. Just the one straw.

The Swan at Swinbrook, pretty place, has appeared in Downton Abbey. President Francois Hollande was taken there and offered potted shrimps, a spot of trout and apple crumble for afters.

Need a drink? M Hollande and Mr Cameron at an Oxfordshire pub yesterday

Not a bad Friday lunch. They even opened a bottle of French wine. Piat d’Or, presumably.

But
 it might as well have been Chateau Sarsons Vinegar 2014. For a terrible
 deed  had been done. Minutes earlier those vilipendious vipers of ze 
British press had done it again.

Chiens!
 Roquets! They had raised the unmentionable. They had contravened  the 
carefully constructed, Scotchgarded, bullet-proofed niceties of 
presidential etiquette.

They had asked about – zut, eek, aiee – le legeauver.

The
 scene of the crime was a hangar at RAF Brize Norton, where M Hollande 
and his intimates (that is, his advisers – for goodness’ sake, you’re as
 bad as the rest of us) had arrived after breakfast.

French President Francois Hollande was seen running out of the pub where he met David Cameron for lunch

The Frenchman appeared to want a quick getaway after a day which saw him clash with Mr Cameron on Europe and face tricky questions about his love life

Their
 dinky little executive jet had dropped through the misty heavens and a 
great-coated David Cameron was on hand as the doors opened. He’d make a 
fair hotel commissionaire, young Cameron.

Frisky
 Francois emerged, smiling. Good grief. I hope the air hostess was all 
right. Behind him was the customary French military bod with kepi and a 
uniform adorned with scrambled-egg braid.

He follows le President (nearly) wherever he goes and carries France’s nuclear-bomb codes in an impressive briefcase.

Or
 at least that is what we are always told. I suppose it may simply 
contain some sandwiches to keep the fellow going until elevenses.

At
 the sight of the president the splendid RAF band burst into the 
Marseillaise. Should have given him a blast of the Can-Can, lads. More 
his thing. 

Awkward: David Cameron and Francois Hollande tried to look relaxed at The Swan Inn barely an hour after they clashed over the need to reform the EU

After tense talks at the summit Prime Minister David Cameron took French President Francois Hollande to The Swan Inn at Swinbrook in Oxfordshire for lunch

Foreign 
Secretary William Hague, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, Energy 
Secretary Ed Davey and Universities Minister David Willetts were in the 
welcome line.

An RAF 
officer was wearing the sort of white gloves favoured by snooker refs. 
He gave one of those salutes that judders for half a minute after it has
 been made. Twangggg!

The 
summit was ostensibly about defence. Deals have been agreed on a 
maritime anti-mine gizmo, a space programme, a drone project and 
continued Franco-British military co-operation.

One
 of the prototype designs of the drone was in the hangar, as were lots 
of French journos and the French foreign minister (who had trouble 
keeping his eyes open during Mr Cameron’s little speech).

The French press corps has proved supine during the scandal of President Hollande and his girlfriends.

French President Francois Hollande refused to comment on whether his affair has made France an international joke

Double trouble: Mr Hollande refused to comment on his affair with actress Julie Gayet (right) or the status of former First Lady Valerie Trierweiler

The old ‘right to privacy’ gambit has been deployed – by a man who controls the codes to nuclear war!

Has
 anyone actually checked to see if his popsy is an enemy agent? Or do I 
contravene the sensibilities of some Parisian Lord Justice Leveson if I 
make that point?

Some say 
the president’s trouser-dropping is no business of we Brits. But here he
 was, signing military communiques with our lot, in the process learning
 some of our military secrets. None of our business?

He
 and Mr Cameron had been asked about EU treaty re-negotiations. M 
Hollande, taller than Ronnie Corbett but not much, radiated nonchalance.

Mentioning the Euro, he oozed superiority – he genuinely seemed to think we might covet that currency.

In June 2010 Mr Cameron and wife Samantha hosted then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni for lunch in 10 Downing Street

Tony and Cherie Blair welcomed French President Jacques Chirac and his wife Bernadette to Downing Street in 2004

Previous pub diplomacy: Tony Blair sought to win over French president Jacques Chirac in 2000 with a pint in the County restaurant in the Labour PM's constituency in County Durham ahead of a summit in France

Then,
 at 12.33pm, it happened. Up popped one of Fleet Street’s finest and 
said: ‘Do you think your private life has made France an international 
joke?

'Are you still having an affair with Julie Gayet and do you wish she was here?’

David
 Cameron doodled, jolly, jolly hard. The French journos sucked in their 
cheeks. A nation quivered. And Monsieur le Frisky, tapping his ballpoint
 on his lectern, snapped that he most certainly did not intend to answer
 zat feelthy question.

As moments go, a bit of a bottom-clencher. But one to cherish.

The mistress of President Francois
 Hollande was yesterday nominated for a French Oscar – for playing a 
sex-obsessed government aide.

Julie
 Gayet, 41, is in the running for a Cesar, the highest honour in French 
cinema, for best supporting actress in Quai d’Orsay.

The
 comedy film is named after the Paris quay where France’s foreign 
ministry is based and Miss Gayet plays a mini-skirted adviser who uses 
her feminine charms to seduce powerful men.

In
 real life, the actress was having a passionate affair with the French 
president, 59, while he was still living with girlfriend Valerie 
Trierweiler.

The two secret lovers regularly met in a flat close to the Elysee Palace.
