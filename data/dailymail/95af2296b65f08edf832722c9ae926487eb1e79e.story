Overlooked details in the infamous lawsuit that won an elderly woman was awarded $2.86million after spilling a cup of scalding McDonalds coffee on herself have been revealed in a re-examination of the case.

Stella Liebeck's lawsuit was turned into a punch-line as many news outlets overlooked the critical facts of the case including the nearly 700 other complaints that McDonalds had received about their hot coffee.

A new video produced by Retro Reports shows the graphic photos of the third-degree burns that then-79-year-old Liebeck received on her groin, saying that after viewing the physical damage that she underwent they decided to give her a hefty sum.

Victim: Stella Liebeck was 79-years-old when she suffered third-degree burns to her groin after spilling a cup of scalding coffee on herself while sitting in a parked car

They initially decided to order the restaurant chain to pay her $160,000 in medical expenses and compensatory damages, as well as an additional $2.7million in punitive damages.

The judge was the one to reduce that amount down to $640,000 before the final payout was settled out of court.

What wasn't commonly reported was the way in which the jury came up with the $2.7million figure.

At the time, McDonalds earned roughly $1.33million per day on coffee sales alone, so the jury felt it was appropriate for them to pay the equivalent of two day's earnings.

Another point in Mrs Liebeck's favor- which was pointed out in a documentary called 'Hot Coffee'- was the fact that McDonalds ordered workers to brew their coffee between 180 degrees and 190 degrees. Typical at-home coffee machines brew their drinks at about 30 degrees lower. 

Infamous: The details of her lawsuit were kept confidential for much of the case, making many see it as outrageous that a jury awarded her $2.9million in damages from McDonalds

Verdict: The judge lowered the pay out to $640,000 and then they finally settled out of court, but what many did not understand was that $2.7m of the $2.9m made up two days of coffee profits for the fast food giant

WARNING: This photo was one shown to the jury where they saw the skin graft that had to be taken out of Mrs Liebeck's leg to replace the skin that had suffered third degree burns in her groin

A doctor testified that a 180-degree liquid can cause third-degree burns in less than 15 seconds.

That is what happened to Mrs Liebeck.

She was sitting in the passenger seat of her grandson's parked car when she put the coffee between her knees and spilt it in her lap.

Rush to judgement: Her case was seen as an example of being overly litigious, but many did not know the real details

'All I remember was trying to get out of the car. I screamed, not realizing I was burned that bad. I just knew I was in terrible pain,' she said in a television interview.

She sustained burns over 16 per cent of her body, and doctors later determined that 6 per cent of that area were classified as third-degree burns.

She spent a week in the hospital being treated for the burns, which racked up $10,000 in medical expenses.

Retro
 Reports states that Mrs Liebeck sent a letter to the fast food giant 
asking for them to pay for her medical expenses and they said that they 
would give her $800 to settle the issue.

She went on to try two more times to settle out of court before taking it to a judge and jury.

'I
 was not in it for the money. I was in it because I wanted them to bring
 the temperature down so that other people would not go through the same
 thing I did,' Mrs Liebeck said in an interview included in the Retro 
Report.

Mrs Liebeck's case 
turned into the touchstone for complaints about excessive litigation, 
but many did not know the details of the case due to her inability to 
speak out after signing on to the confidential agreement reached between
 she and McDonalds.

She died at the age of 91 in 2004.

'The emotion that she went through- she just felt that people were coming at her,' her daughter Judy Allen said in the documentary.
