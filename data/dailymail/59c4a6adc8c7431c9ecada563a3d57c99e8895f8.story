Radio DJ and TV presenter Chris Evans, 48, has been pictured for the first time since revealing that he is is in the middle of a prostate cancer scare

Evans, pictured above backstage during BBC One’s The One Show, said that he had 'completely changed my tune on this over the last couple of years' and encouraged anyone 'worried about anything' to see a doctor

Evans last night took to Twitter where he acknowledged he didn't know how serious the scare was but also downplayed the threat saying he might just be suffering from a urinary infection

Evans said he was prompted to see a doctor after not being able to stop 'peeing' since Christmas.

He told his listeners: ‘Thank you once again to Kenney Jones, of The Who who was diagnosed with prostate cancer a couple of years ago and since recovery has been a fundraiser and supporter of Prostate Cancer UK.

‘Prostate cancer, and colon cancer of course, are one of the most survivable forms of cancer there is, if caught early enough. It not, one of the least. It's a fine line between life and death, happiness and tragedy.

‘And I've got to say I'm in the middle of a prostate issue right now! I couldn't stop. I have not been able to stop since Christmas - peeing - or wanting to go. So I've gone to the doctor.

Evans said hew had 'scared myself half to death' by going on the internet and looking up the condition 

‘I've done all the internet stuff that you shouldn't do, I've gone on the internet, scared myself half to death, then gone to see the doctor. And we really should do it the other way round. However I'm in the middle of the tests.’

Last night Evans took to Twitter thanking his fans for their support and downplaying the scare. 

He wrote: Getting lots of concerned messages about me and my prostate. Probably more likely a urine infection or irritable bladder. But always best to check. That's the message.'

During Evans' radio show, traffic presenter Lynn Bowles told the star: 'You seem ok about that.’

Evans replied: ‘Well, you've got to be. I've completely changed my tune on this over the last couple of years. So there you go. If you are worried about anything just go and sort yourself out - if not for you, for your family.’

Evans is married to golfer Natasha Shishmanian, with whom he has two young sons, Noah, five, and Eli, 18 months

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year.

The disease, which usually affects men over 50, often develops slowly, so there may be no signs a man has it for many years.

The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that sits below the bladder in men.

Its main function is to produce a white fluid that is mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles, to create semen.

The gland is shaped like a doughnut with a hole in the middle. Through this hole runs the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body.

The problem is that the prostate often grows with age, squashing the urethra and obstructing the flow when a man urinates.

This can be a sign of an enlarged prostate, which is not usually a serious threat to health.

However the following symptoms can also be a sign of prostate cancer.

These include:

Needing to urinate more frequently, often during the night

Needing to rush to the toilet

Difficulty in starting to pee

Straining or taking a long time while urinating

Weak flow or feeling that the bladder has not emptied fully
