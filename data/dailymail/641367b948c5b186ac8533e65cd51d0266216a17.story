ISIS militants fighting in Iraq and Syria have revealed a bizarre soft spot for the chocolate hazelnut spread Nutella.

Members of the jihadist group posed for photographs holding jars of the Italian sweet treat while standing in supermarkets inside the Islamic State - the group's self-declared caliphate.

The images were subsequently uploaded to Twitter - sparking an intense debate among the fighters and their supporters over the virtues of Nutella.

Twitter user 'Ariane al-Britania' said muharjiroon [militants] have jokingly discussed the assertion that Nutella may have radicalized Western Muslims

After the images of the Nutella-loving jihadists emerged on Twitter, a number of users joked that the spread could be the best way to put a halt to the group's expansion in the Middle East.

One Twitter user going by the handle @FatCated asked: 'Could an embargo on Nutella or Chupa Chups (a type of lollypop) destroy the morale of #IS mercenaries? #ISIS'

Another calling herself Ariane al-Britania joked: 'It is very possible that Nutella is responsible 4 the radicalization of Muslims in the West lol.'

It is not the first time ISIS militants have used social media to reveal their surprising interests. 

In
 the wake of Hollywood actor Robin Williams' death earlier this week 
dozens of ISIS militants and sympathisers took to Twitter to express 
their love of his film Jumanji.

The
 conversation quickly turned to Hollywood films in general, with one 
19-year-old ISIS supporter - who calls himself 'Abdullah' and uses the 
Twiiter handle @Mujahid4life - declaring his love for all 'Disney 
Renaissance' films and revealing himself to be a fan of Star Wars.

'Abdullah'
 also said he had stopped watching hit HBO television Game of Thrones 
after two episodes because it contained too much nudity.

There is also a Twitter account dubbed the Islamic State of Cat, which features masked and gun-toting jihadists holding tiny kittens.

ISIS terrorists - who have previously been condemned as too extreme even by Al-Qaeda - may soon be forced to forgo Nutella, however, after the cost of hazelnuts rose by 60 per cent.

Italian manufacturer Ferrero may be forced to dramatically increase the price of the spread and reduce their locations in which it is sold after bad weather devastated hazelnut crops in Turkey -which borders both Syria and Iraq.

While the extent of the damage to the hazelnut flowers on Turkey’s Black Sea coast is not yet fully evident, it is feared about 300,000 tonnes of the crop could have been damaged in March’s poor weather.

It comes after continued warnings about the rising cost of cocoa which has continued to soar as demand outstrips production.
