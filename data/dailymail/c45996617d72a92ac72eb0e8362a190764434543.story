Both young men came from Plainfield, Illinois while Miss Banuelos was from nearby Naperville.

The truck driver, 45-year-old Scott Fernatt from Hodgkins,  was taken to Rush-Copley Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries. No alcohol was found in his system.

Mr Herrera's Ford coupe was traveling south around 3pm when it collided with the truck, according to Illinois State Police.

The truck flipped onto its side, pinning the car beneath it. Paramedics needed to use extrication tools to reach the teenagers.

The roof of the teenagers' car was crushed and the truck, which had been transporting sand, also rolled over. A section of Route 126 was closed for several hours yesterday but later reopened.

Sandy Diller, who lives near where the crash happened, told ABC7: 'It is the most unsafe intersection that I have ever seen in my life.

'At least once a month there is a wreck at that corner.'
