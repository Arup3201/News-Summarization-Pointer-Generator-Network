A man was mauled to death by the pet pit bull he loved on Christmas day.

Eddie Cahill, 40, was on the ground in his home in Portage, Indiana covered in bites and blood when his wife Blanca Rodriguez returned home at 5 p.m. from spending the day with her family.

Blanca was horrified to find her beloved husband on the floor in a puddle of his own blood. 

Rodriguez also found one of the family's dogs, 8-year-old Fat Boy, with a ring of blood around its mouth.

Killed by his dog: Eddie Cahill, 40, was mauled to death on Christmas day by his pit bull Fat Boy 

Dead:

Married: Eddie's wife Blanca discovered his dead body on the floor of their Indiana home 

‘His dogs were his life,’ said his mourning wife to reporters as she held back tears.

The family has another dog named Keylo who is also eight-years-old.

WGN reports that Rodriguez called Animal control officers who tasered Fat Boy then euthanized him at the request of the family.

Rodriguez told reporters she never had problems with her pit bull before and called this a 'freak accident.'

'I don't want people to think bad of pit bulls. It was a freak accident. He loved the dogs,' Rodriguez told reporters.

Unlike Fat Boy: Blanca told reporters her pit bull Fat Boy was playful and loving but told police that the dog was unpredictable and violent and that she told her husband to euthanize it in the past 

Mourning: 'I don't want people to think bad of pit bulls. It was a freak accident. He loved the dogs,' Rodriguez told reporters following her husband's death

She said her husband might have been playing keep-away with the dog bones they got the dog for Christmas and that it could have triggered the attack.

She even said she let the dogs sleep in the same room as her daughters.

‘They were playful dogs,' she said. 'One slept with the girls and the other slept with me and my husband.’

Rodriguez told police another story after her husband's death saying she told her husband to euthanize the dog in the past because it was 'violent and unpredictable.'
