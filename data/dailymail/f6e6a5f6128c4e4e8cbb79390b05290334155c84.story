Neither Ukraine nor Israel will be allowed to play next month's Davis Cup ties on home soil because of security issues, the International Tennis Federation has ruled.

At a meeting held on Tuesday, the ITF board of directors upheld an appeal from Ukraine's opponents Belgium that their World Group play-off should not be held in Kiev because of continued unrest in the country.

A statement on the Davis Cup website read: 'The Board noted that the original decision by the Davis Cup Committee had not been unanimous; and that, while the recent political unrest had occurred in eastern Ukraine, a disturbance in Kiev's Independence Square as recently as last Thursday indicated that the security situation there was fluid.'

Anger: The World number 80 hit out at the ITF for taking a political stance against his country

The decision was immediately condemned by Ukrainian number two Sergiy Stakhovsky, who wrote on Twitter: 'This is insane !!! @ITF-Tennis forbids £ukraine to play home!! £belgium federation you are far from being decent .'

The ITF board, meanwhile, rejected an appeal from Israel, who had hoped to overturn an earlier decision forbidding their World Group play-off against Argentina from being played in Tel Aviv.

Both Ukraine and Israel now have the option to name a neutral venue for the ties, which will be held from September 12-14.

Tough call: ITF President Francesco Ritti Bitti said that it was a difficult decision but made for safety reasons

ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti said: 'It is always a very difficult decision for the ITF to take away choice of ground in Davis Cup.

'The competition was founded on the principles of better understanding among nations and we believe it has done a good job in fostering this over 114 years.

'However, the safety of players, officials and spectators has to take priority and the Board believed that it was not prudent to hold ties in Ukraine or Israel because of political unrest in these countries at the present time and for the foreseeable future.'
