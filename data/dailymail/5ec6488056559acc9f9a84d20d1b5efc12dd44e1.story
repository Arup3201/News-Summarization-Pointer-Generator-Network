Goalmouth to gantry: Collymore in his role as a pundit for talkSPORT

Stan Collymore has demanded action from Twitter after a user said he should ‘go hang himself like Gary Speed’.

As the row over racism in football rumbled on, the abusive Tweet finished with ‘ok negrito’ – a reference to Luis Suarez’s comment to Patrice Evra.

The Liverpool player was banned for eight games and fined £40,000 after using words that ‘included a reference to Mr Evra’s colour'.

The news that John Terry is to be charged with racially abusing Anton Ferdinand during a match, and a storm of anger over Alan Hansen's reference to 'coloured' players has only served to bring the issue of racism in football to the fore in recent weeks.

The racist abuse Collymore has been subjected to began in the wake of his comments on the Hansen incident, in which he tried to highlight the problem of racism in football.

Collymore, who won three England caps and is now a talkSPORT pundit, also linked to a number of other posts apparently voicing support for Suarez using highly offensive racist language.

Collymore’s online argument started after he was quoted in response to Alan Hansen’s remarks on Match of the Day on Saturday. He highlighted his links to racist comments, saying ‘you tell me there’s nothing to address’.

A poster called Jon Juwanson then tweeted ‘@StanCollymore do us a favour Stan and go and hang yourself like Gary Speed did please. Ok Negrito’.

Also mocking the former player's admission that he suffered from depression.

He then continued to abuse Collymore before his misspelled defence of ‘Woy um I racest. Negrito meens pal.’

Alan Hansen was forced to issue an apology after being dragged into the racism row by 
referring to black players as ‘coloured’.

In
a discussion of the controversies surrounding England captain Terry and Liverpool striker Suarez, Hansen used the word as he 
praised the achievements of black players in the Premier League.

But
many viewers objected to the term – considered offensive because it 
dismisses everyone who is not white as the same – and the Corporation 
yesterday received more than 100 complaints.

Others
were quick to defend the former Scotland international, however, with 
Twitter users and former MP Ann Widdecombe describing the outrage at 
Hansen’s comment as an overreaction.

Hansen,
who is thought to earn about £40,000 a show, used the term ‘coloured’ 
twice on Wednesday night’s edition of the BBC1 programme as he and 
fellow pundit Lee Dixon talked about racism in football.

The
discussion happened on the day it was revealed Terry will face a 
criminal charge over allegedly using racist language on the pitch.

The
56-year-old said: ‘I think there’s a lot of coloured players in all the
major teams and there are lots of coloured players who are probably the
best in the Premier League.

‘If
you look at 25 or 30 years ago it was probably in a bad way – not as 
bad as some of the other nations on the Continent – but certainly there 
is always, always room for improvement.’

After
the row over his comments blew up, Hansen said in a 
statement: ‘I unreservedly apologise for any offence caused.

‘This was never my intention  and I deeply regret the use of  the word.’

A senior BBC sport insider said 
the pundit was ‘mortified’ about the comments, which came after a 
‘really long’ and ‘challenging’ day in the studio.

They
suggested that the heightened ‘sensitivity’ around descriptions of race
on the football field may have led him to resort to a word he does not 
usually use. ‘He is not a racist at all, in any sense,’ they added.

But
ex-Premier League footballer Darren Huckerby tweeted: ‘Does anybody 
think that people are just jumping on the bandwagon about the Alan 
Hansen comment?’

Another observer wrote: ‘Massive overreaction about Alan Hansen calling black players “coloured”! He’s just old school.’

And
another added: ‘Got to feel for Alan Hansen. Praising black PL players 
and condemning racism in football only for some idiots to take offence –
ridiculous.’

England captain Terry was told this week that he must appear in court next year to answer a criminal charge of using racist language on the field.

To the fury of anti-racism campaigners, top officials at the Football Association stayed silent after the footballer was formally summonsed yesterday over an outburst against a black player during a Premier League clash.

The multi-millionaire defender – who denies any racial abuse – also continued to enjoy the backing of his club, Chelsea.

He is accused of calling Ferdinand a ‘f****** black ****’ during the match at QPR’s Loftus Road stadium.

But afterwards he told Ferdinand, whose brother Rio plays alongside Terry for England, that the remarks had been taken out of context, insisting he actually said: ‘Oi, Anton, do you think I called you a  black ****?’

Terry will first appear in court next February but the case is likely to drag on for up to six months as lawyers prepare for a trial.

The maximum punishment Terry faces is a £2,500 fine, a sum he earns in just two hours and 38 minutes on his £160,000-a-week salary.

Last night, Terry, 31, said he was ‘disappointed’ with the decision and that he hoped to clear his name ‘as quickly as possible’.

He said: ‘I have never aimed a racist remark at anyone and count people from all races and creeds among my closest friends.’
