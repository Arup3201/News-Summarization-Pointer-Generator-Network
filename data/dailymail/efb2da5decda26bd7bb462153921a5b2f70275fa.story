Kirk Kerkorian, known as one of the 'godfathers' of Las Vegas, celebrated his grandson Julian's Bar Mitzvah on Saturday

No expense was spared for the coming of age of former MGM mogul Kirk Kerkorian's grandson who celebrated becoming a man on Saturday with a $450,000 James Bond-themed Bar Mitzvah.

Julian, whose parents are Kerkorian's daughter Linda and Ross Hilton Kemper celebrated his special day with the glitzy event at the Beverly Hills Hotel in L.A.

A host of stars have been boycotting the hotel due to the anti-gay stance of owner the Sultan of Brunei, but that wasn’t a problem for pop stars Iggy Azalea and Nick Jonas who both performed at the bash.

Jonas’ performance went off without a hitch, but the same could not be said for the Australian rapper who treated the room full of 13-year-olds to a sneak peak after her pants split at the crotch.

The rip appeared as she was belting out lyrics from her Jennifer Lopez collaboration Booty, turning away from the audience and ferociously shaking her hips.

In video footage the wardrobe malfunction, the audience can be heard screaming once they realized what had happened to the Fancy hit-maker. 

Once the rapper realized what had happened she attempted to cover it up by strategically placing her hands and modifying her dance routine.

The event was certainly an extravagant affair with lots of 007-related touches including a casino and fancy flower displays.

However it is far from the most expensive Bar Mitzvah ever, which cost body armor mogul David Brooks $10 million in 2007.

The Bat Mitzvah for his daughter Elizabeth featured performances from Stevie Nicks, 50 Cent, Ciara, and Aerosmith. Brooks was sentenced to 17 years in prison after being found guilty of securities fraud and conspiracy in 2010. 

Julian's grandfather Kirk Kerkorian is known as one of the 'godfathers' of Las Vegas for his early role in the development of some of the city's most legendary hotels like Caeser's Palace and the MGM Grand.

A legend and a casino pioneer in the development of mega-resorts in Las Vegas, Kerkorian has a net worth is nearly $4.5 billion.
