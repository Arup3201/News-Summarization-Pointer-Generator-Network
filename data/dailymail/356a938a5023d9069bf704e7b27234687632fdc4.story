This is the hilarious moment a curious pufferfish managed to not only photobomb an unsuspecting diver - it took over his selfie-session altogether.

Underwater photographer Regan Mizuguchi was busy taking pictures of himself off the Kohala Coast in Hawaii when the fish swam into shot and decided it wanted to be famous.

The frightened fish managed to completely eclipse the face of Mr Mizuguchi after inflating its body as a defence mechanism.

Sneaking into frame: Mr Mizuguchi said he noticed the fish, but because it was inflated he kept a safe distance away in order not to scare it

Luckily, the sharp spines were a safe distance away from the Hawaiian, and after realising he wasn't a threat the fish deflated and swam away.

Mr Mizuguchi said he had noticed the fish while experimenting with his GoPro camera, but because it was inflated 'I didn't want scare the little fish anymore than it was, so I stayed still and carried on taking photos'.

He was unaware he'd captured the marine animals mugshot until he exited the water and checked his camera.

Mr Mizuguchi said: 'It was only after I reviewed the images that I noticed it had completely blocked out my face in one of the shots, I couldn't believe how perfect it was.

'I'm really glad the fish decided to photo bomb me, that photograph is definitely a keeper.'
