The parents of a pregnant mentally-disabled woman are trying to block a judge from holding hearings they fear could result in the compulsory abortion of her baby.

The Nevada couple are the legal guardians of their 32-year-old daughter, who has the mental capacity of a six-year-old, and have exclusive authority over her health care decisions.

Washoe County District Judge Egan Walker
 lacks the authority to decide whether the woman should be allowed to give birth, according to a 
motion to halt the proceedings that they have filed at the Nevada Supreme Court.

Big issue: The parents of a pregnant woman with a mental age of six are trying to block a judge from holding hearings they fear could result in the compulsory abortion of her baby

The woman was living in a Reno group home when she wandered away from it and became pregnant 13 weeks ago. The child's father has not been identified.

It is unknown whether 
the pregnancy resulted from rape or consensual sex, according to the couple's attorney Jason Guinasso. The circumstances are under investigation by the county public guardian's office.

Both the parents and the woman want her to carry the baby to term in line with their Catholic religious beliefs.

The Supreme Court has set a deadline of noon today for the judge and county officials to respond to the request to halt evidentiary hearings into the woman's health. The hearings are scheduled to resume Tuesday.

The couple acknowledges the pregnancy poses health risks to their daughter and the baby.

But they say medical experts back them in their decision to continue the pregnancy.

Mr Guinasso said: 'Does she understand all the risk? I doubt it.

'But we do know the guardians understand the risk, and they're the ones given the authority and responsibility to make the decision. They have a perfectly healthy baby and mother.'

Six couples have expressed an interest in adopting the baby, the woman's parents said.

At a court hearing on Thursday, two medical experts testified that the pregnancy carries risks because the woman has epilepsy and is on medication.

But they were split on whether the pregnancy should be terminated.

The court gave the woman's parents guardianship for her when she became 18.

Last month, the judge denied the couple's request to allow the woman to move back home with them and to halt the proceedings.

Deputy District Attorney Dania Reid stressed there has been no motion or discussion to order an abortion in the case.

She noted Judge Walker appointed the county public guardian's office as a 'neutral fact-finder' to investigate the pregnant woman's condition in regard to her medical, psychiatric and group home care.

Mrs Reid said: 'It's not the county's role in this case to make any findings of conclusions whether or not this pregnancy should continue. That's entirely up to the court.'

Olivia Gans Turner, spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based organisations National Right To Life and American Victims Of Abortion, said the Nevada couple have drawn the support of pro-life advocates nationwide.

She said: 'This is a cause we support. It's definitely their right to protect their daughter's right to have a child and to protect the life of their grandchild.

'There's no reason for this woman to be subjected to the danger and risk of an abortion because someone else thinks she's not worthy of having a child because of her mental condition.'
