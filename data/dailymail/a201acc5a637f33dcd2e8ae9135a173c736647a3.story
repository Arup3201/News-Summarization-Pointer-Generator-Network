She is the powerhouse female Chancellor bankrolling Europe. And she is certainly no stranger to criticism.

However Angela Merkel is probably more used to fending off comments about her economic policies than her appearance.

But now eccentric designer Karl Lagerfeld has said that he thinks the German chancellor should dress 'according to her special proportions'.

The Chanel designer 9right) described the German Chancellor (left) as having 'special proportions

The outspoken Chanel creative director – who has previously come under fire for his controversial comments about singer Adele and other well-known females – criticised the German political figure for the trousers she wore in a meeting with United States President, Barack Obama, in June.

He told Germany's Focus magazine: 'Miss Merkel [should dress] according to her special proportions. [When she was pictured with Obama], the proportions were bad, like the cut. The pants were too long.'

Angela is the latest woman to feel the brunt of the 79-year-old fashion designer's acid tongue, following his criticism of Adele, Pippa Middleton and Michelle Obama.

Never one to shy away from controversy, Karl famously branded the 'Skyfall' hitmaker a 'little too fat' in February 2012, while complimenting her "beautiful face and divine voice" at the same time.

Karl gave singer Adele a rather backhanded compliment. While complimenting her voice he also stated that she was 'a little too fat'

Pippa Middleton was also on the sharp end of Karl's tongue when he said she should only ever show her back

The designer also insisted Pippa Middleton – sister to Britain's Duchess Catherine – should  'only ever show her back', and recently claimed: 'I think that her sister looks better.'

More recently, Karl gave his unflinching opinion of US First Lady Michelle Obama's fringe haircut, saying: 'Frankly, the fringe was a bad idea.'
