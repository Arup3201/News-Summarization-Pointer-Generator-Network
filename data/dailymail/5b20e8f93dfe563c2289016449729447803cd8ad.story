Nearly all of us have experienced the familiar butterflies when it's time for the dreaded trip to the dentist.

Now one enterprising dental surgeon from Java, Indonesia, has created a new tool he hopes will put a smile instead of a grimace on his patients' faces.

Dr Dhanni Gustiana has created a musical drill to drown out the ominous high-pitch whine of the tool. He hopes it will especially soothe his nervous younger patients.

Dr Gustiana, 37, from Purworejo, Central Java province, decided to create the new appliance after finding out the drill was what children feared most.

He said: 'The children are not afraid of doctor, many of them are afraid of drill. I modified this by putting a toy on the head of the drill and tell them that the toy will clean their teeth.'

In 2006, after a year of research, Dr Gustiana created a musical dental drill. He modified a conventional dental drill, changing the buzzing sound to the music from a MP3 player. It also features colourful flashing lights.

'The patient will hear the music louder when they open their mouths compared to when they close their mouths,' said Dr Gustiana.

The dental surgeon spent about six million rupiah (Â£372) to modify the instrument. His patients can even request songs loaded onto the MP3 player.

Gustiana also has various figurines made from silicon which can be placed on the drill head. He treats more than 15 patients a day, of whom about half are children. He says some adults also ask him to use the singing drill on them.

One young patient, Anavaya Siddartta, appeared to enjoy her dental treatment with the musical mouth implement at Gustiana's surgery.

Her mother, Christine Ratnawati, said: 'Very interesting, the children listening to the music and they forget about the drill in their mouth. This is a good idea to overcome fear of dental drill.'

Dr Gustiana said with the musical drill, most of his children's patients are not even aware of what he is doing.

He presented his creation at the International Dental Congress in Greece in March this year.
