Eurostar has announced plans to launch direct services from London to the southern French port city of Marseille from May 1 next year.

The year-round service will make stops at Lyon in eastern France and Avignon before heading on to the oldest city in France, which was founded in 600BC.

The journey will take four and a half hours to Lyon, six hours to Avignon and about six hours and 15 minutes to Marseille.

The city, which was made the European Capital of Culture in 2013, was France's main port during colonial times but had been seen as somewhat rundown in recent ears.

But ahead of its year as Capital of Culture, the Old Port was spruced up and several museums were added to the Mediterranean city's offering.

En-route stop-off Lyon is widely regarded as France's gastronomic capital while Avignon hosts the country's best known theatre festival in July.

High-speed: Eurostar has announced plans to launch direct services from London to the southern French port city of Marseille that will take just six hours

The return journey to London will take an
 hour longer due to immigration and customs formalities that will take 
place in the northern city of Lille.

Travel from London to Marseille, with a change in Paris, currently takes at least six hours 45 minutes and Eurostar currently runs direct summer services to Avignon.

Tickets for the new service to Marseille will go on sale from December.
