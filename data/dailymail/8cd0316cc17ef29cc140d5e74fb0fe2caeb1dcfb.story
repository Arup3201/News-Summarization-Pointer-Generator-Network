Caught on camera: A 99-year-old running enthusiast has set a new 100-meter record for her age group, at 59.8 seconds

Determined: Ida Keeling from New York City achieved the feat on Tuesday at the Gay Games in Akron, Ohio

Special moment: The senior was greeted by her daughter and trainer, Shelley Kelling, at the finish line

When she reached the finish line spectators greeted her with a round of applause.

Her coach and daughter, Shelley Kelling, also went to give her a big hug.

'Mom is amazing even to me,' Ms Kelling said of her mother. 'I have to admit that. She is a remarkable human being.'

Although
 the great-great-grandmother finished last in the 100 meters, it is 
believed no woman her age has ever recorded a faster time in an 
internationally-certified race.

It's not the first record the senior has set.

Breaking sweat: Ms Keeling raced in temperatures around 80 degrees Fahrenheit

Keeping in shape: She is determined to keep running as long as possible, and to outlive her grandmother, who survived until the age of 104

Dressed for the occasion: Ms Keeling wears her favorite gold Nike running shoes

Starting line: Although the great-great-grandmother finished last in the 100 meters, it is believed no woman her age has ever recorded a faster time in an internationally-certified race

In 2011 Ms Keeling achieved a world best for her age group in the 60 meters with a time of 29.86 seconds on the track.

She participated in the race alongside girls a quarter of her age.

The jogger said at the time: 'I feel like a puppy. I feel younger now than when I was in my 30s and 40s.'

Ms Keeling, whose husband died of a heart attack at the age of 42, decided to take up running nearly 30 years ago.

Her lawyer daughter, who coaches track and field at a nearby high school, convinced her to give it a try at the age of 67.

And
 after a life of sadness - she also lost two sons, Charles and Donald, 
to drug-related killings in 1979 and 1981 - the senior citizen found 
refuge in running.

Pumping iron: The fitness fanatic lifts weights in her New York apartment

'It felt good, and I felt uplifted,' she previously told ABC. 'I said, "Well, gee, this is for me".'

She trains in the corridors of her Bronx apartment block, lifts weights and cycles on an exercise bike.

She also prefers to eat her evening meal - a hamburger, fish, or liver - for breakfast.

'Gives me fuel for the day,' she said.

And
 her health regime is paying dividends - she takes just one prescription
 drug and could easily pass for a woman 20 years younger.

She is determined to keep running as long as possible, and to outlive her grandmother, who survived until the age of 104.

'Every
 year I am going to keep doing what I am doing, and when running time 
comes, if I feel I am ready, I will go at it,' she said.

She turns 100 next May.
