If Rangers’ victory in Methil perhaps lacked some of the sparkle provided by rival televised football attractions on Tuesday night, there was value in it all the same.

Value that, they hope, may yet be measured in silverware.

Ally McCoist’s men booked their place away to Alloa Athletic in the semi-finals of the Petrofac Training Cup with something to spare, eventually running out comfortable enough winners against East Fife.

Goals from Jon Daly and Ian Black ensured the Fifers’ 41-year wait for a win over Rangers would go on. And, in Black, the visitors had the outstanding performer on view.

One goal and an assist, plus a vital clearance, tell only part of the tale.

The midfielder’s all-action performance brought a great deal to a quarter-final played in front of a small and slightly subdued crowd; this was never going to be one for the history books, more an opportunity for the diehards to prove their loyalty.

Some of those with sharp memories may have recalled that, almost exactly a year ago, Dave King had made his most recent appearance at a Rangers game right here at Bayview.

Back in the country for talks about a £16million rescue package for the club, he eschewed the delights of a bitterly cold night in Methil in favour of … well, take your pick.

This postponed tie — put off from the weekend of the Germany-Scotland game because Rangers had lost too many players to international call-ups — was up against some pretty decent telly fitba, which perhaps contributed to East Fife’s decision not to repeat their experiment with temporary stands in expectation of a bumper crowd.

Just over six weeks on, the hosts were content to bank the takings from a sell-out attendance of 2,000, all huddled into the one stand of this still-new stadium. If it remains a little exposed to the elements, there are plenty of worse places to watch a game in Scotland.

The pitch is perfect, too. No excuses, then, for a visiting team expected to storm into the last four of a tournament offering the chance to win a trophy, be it ever so humble.

Against a team severely depleted by injuries, to the extent that manager Gary Naysmith filled only four of the seven available substitutes’ places on the bench, Rangers showed three changes from the side who thrashed Raith Rovers at Ibrox on Saturday — including handing David Templeton a first start since August 23.

Nicky Clark and Daly also started in place of Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd, one strike partnership replacing another.

A pretty astute switch by McCoist, as it turned out.

Having begun brightly enough, Rangers were actually beginning to toil just a little when Clark and Daly — aided and abetted by Black — combined for the opener with 29 minutes gone.

Up to that point, we had seen Templeton show a great deal of willingness and intent, Lee Wallace rampaging forward from left-back to some effect — and a couple of good saves from home keeper Allan Fleming, his best from a low Templeton shot.

But East Fife’s man-marking, lying deep and letting the Rangers central defenders enjoy as much possession as possible, seemed set to stymie Rangers.

Everything was becoming a little congested in and around the danger area. The breakthrough came as a great relief to the large away support, then. And it was well created, Black knocking the ball into Clark, who darted into the box and picked out a cross.

Black’s attempt on goal was deflected — but Daly was right where he needed to be, virtually standing on the goal line, to nudge the ball home from inches.

The Fifers, who had looked more than a little threatening in possession themselves, rallied after going a goal down. Black had to look sharp to block a deflected Allan Walker free-kick at the near post moments after the opener.

Lee McCulloch had the ball in the net three minutes before the break, although he had been flagged for offside — one of three Rangers players on the wrong side of the line — well before finishing.

Wallace had to look sharp to deny Nathan Austin a crack at goal from a Caolan McAleer cross as half-time approached, a reminder for Rangers they couldn’t relax on a 1-0 lead.

Templeton’s pace began to cause serious problems for the hosts after the break, both Ewan Moyes and Ross Brown finding themselves booked for fouls on the quicksilver winger within the space of five minutes.

The second of those offences led to a near thing in the home box, as a Black free-kick from the left wing resulted in a flashing Clark header that just cleared the far post.

Another set-piece opportunity, this time for a Moyes foul on Clark, gave Black a more direct sight on goal just before the hour mark. One he wasn’t about to waste.

Lining up his chance from the edge of the box, the midfielder simply drilled the ball past the wall and through goalkeeper Fleming.

That was effectively the end of an unequal contest, with the introduction of former Scotland stars Miller and Boyd for Rangers emphasising the gulf between the sides. Why, it was almost like watching Bayern dominate in Rome. Almost.
