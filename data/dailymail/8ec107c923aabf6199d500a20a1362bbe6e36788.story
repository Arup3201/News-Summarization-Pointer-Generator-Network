New DNA evidence has cast doubt on the murder conviction of the retired teacher jailed for the 'Lady in the Lake' murder.

In 2005, Gordon Park was found guilty of murdering his wife Carol with an ice axe and dumping her body in Coniston Water in Cumbria 30 years earlier.

Her badly beaten, weighted-down body was found at the bottom of the lake 21 years after her death in 1976, and Park's eventual conviction ended what had been one of Britain's most notorious unsolved cases.

The family of Gordon Park (pictured left with third wife Jenny in 2005) say new DNA evidence has cast doubt over his murder conviction for killing first wife Carol (right), who became known as the Lady of the Lake

Park had always denied killing his 30-year-old wife, and was found hanged in his cell at HMP Garth, Lancashire, on January 25, 2010 - the morning of his 66th birthday.

Now the case is again under scrutiny, and Park's family have reportedly found new DNA evidence that they say may clear his name and open the door for a new investigation into Mrs Park's death.

The evidence will be presented to independent watchdog the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which reviews alleged miscarriages of justice and has confirmed it is 'actively investigating' the case.

It is understood that the CCRC is due to visit Coniston as part of the investigation, although it has not commented on this.

Denial: Park had always denied killing his 30-year-old wife, pictured with him on their wedding day in 1967

Accused: Park, pictured with Carol on her 21st birthday in 1966, was accused of bludgeoning her to death with an ice axe, and dumping her body in Coniston Water

The retired schoolmaster was accused of bludgeoning Mrs Park to death with an ice axe in July 1976 and dumping her body in the lake near the family home in Leece, near Barrow-in-Furness.

He claimed he had taken their children on a trip to Blackpool on the day she vanished, and that she had gone to live with another man.

Her body had come to rest on an underwater ledge and was found by amateur divers 21 years later. 

The case became known as ‘Lady in the Lake’ after the Raymond Chandler novel of the same name.

Mrs Park was found wearing her blue baby doll night-dress, arms bound tightly and with tape over her eyes.

After the grim discovery, Park was arrested and charged with her murder but the case against him was dropped in January 1998 when the Crown Prosecution Service said it did not have enough evidence against him.

A second police investigation uncovered fresh evidence by linking him to the killing with the knots meticulously used to tie up the body and a piece of Westmorland green slate used to weigh it down, which matched the stone used to build the family home.

In 2005, Park was found guilty of murder at Manchester Crown Court and jailed for life as he was told he would serve a minimum of 15 years.

However, he had always maintained his innocence and wrote letters to the media from jail. His family, including third wife Jenny and his children Jeremy and Rachel have continued campaigned for his conviction to be overturned posthumously.

Jeremy Park, who is leading the campaign to clear his father's name, said the DNA evidence had been uncovered by the family's lawyers, but has not given further details.

'This test may shed some serious new light on this whole thing,' he told The Telegraph's Bill Gardner. 'This will all come out very soon.'

It is also believed that the watchdog may be re-examining evidence from a woman who said she saw Park push something into Coniston Water in 1976, coming forward to give her account in 2004.

Joan Young's testimony was challenged during the trial, when it was argued that she was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Mrs Park's body that was being dumped as Mrs Young was positioned in a way that the place where the body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island.

Mrs Park's nieces, Kay Washford, 50, and Claire Gardener, 45, both from Barrow, who now live in Preston, say they both think the correct verdict was given at the time.

Park's family launched a fresh bid to clear his name in 2010 - nine months after he was found dead in his prison cell on his 66th birthday.

In 2013 an inquest jury in Preston ruled that Park, of Barrow, had killed himself.  

For the last four years, the CCRC has been examining evidence and police files to see if the case should go before the Court of Appeal.

The CCRC investigates miscarriages of justice in the UK and rarely considers cases when the person has died.

Such a probe can take up to six years to fully investigate, in some cases. Many claimed that much of the evidence against Park could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free Park from prison and to clear his name.

Son: Jeremy Park (pictured at the family home in 1997), who is leading the campaign to clear his father's name, said the DNA evidence had been uncovered by the family's lawyers

The case featured prominently in the book, No Smoke - The Shocking Truth About British Justice, which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder.

A spokesman for the watchdog refused to confirm or deny a site visit, only saying: 'The CCRC is actively investigating this case.'

Mrs Washford, the daughter of Carol Park's now deceased brother, Ivor Price said: 'The Park family will not accept the evidence that was put to the courts to help convict Gordon.

'I really think they are clutching at straws and hoping to find an answer that isn't there. Myself and Claire still feel the correct verdict was given.

'Gordon went to the High Court of Appeal and lost, so what makes them think after all this time they could find any information that could overturn the court's decision? And we will carry on fighting for justice.'

Murdered: School teacher Carol Park, pictured in 1963, vanished from her home in Leece, near Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria during the drought-hit summer of 1976

School teacher Carol Park vanished from her home in Leece, near Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria during the drought-hit summer of 1976.

She was 30 and suspicion immediately fell on her husband - with whom she had an 'open' marriage.

Mrs Park's body remained missing until August 1997, when it was discovered, weighted down, by two amateur divers on an underwater ledge in Coniston Water.

Police nicknamed her the Lady in the Lake after the Raymond Chandler crime novel of the same name.

Father-of-three Park was arrested and charged with murder but the charges were dropped in January 1998 due to lack of evidence.

However, he was re-arrested in 2004 and, at the end of a two-month trial at Manchester Crown Court, the jury found him guilty of murder.

The trial became notorious as the courtroom heard the couple had had a tempestuous relationship.

They were involved in wife-swapping parties and Mrs Park had embarked on affairs with several men.

In December 1974, Mrs Park moved to Middlesbrough to live with policeman David Brearley, whom she had met at an Open University summer school.

She planned to marry him, but after failing to win custody of the couple's three children in 1975, she reluctantly returned to the marital home. Meanwhile, Park had relationships with at least two women before agreeing to give his marriage a second chance.

However, the arguments and accusations of infidelity continued and it was against this background that Park was found to have murdered his wife.

The court case was told that he had smashed her in the face with a climber's ice-axe, and kept her body in the freezer until deciding to dispose of it.

Her skeletal remains were dressed in a faded blue baby-doll nightdress when they were found in the lake.

The retired schoolmaster was on holiday in France with his third wife when he was told the body had been found, and is said to have uttered the words 'Oh dear,' in a phone call after being informed of the discovery.

He had claimed that on the day of his first wife's disappearance, he had left her in bed while he took the children to Blackpool for the day, and that she was gone when they returned.

However, he did not report her missing for six weeks.

Park, said to be a control freak, was said to have become frustrated and jealous, and was unable to control his wife.

Police believe Mrs Park was preparing to press for a divorce but was determined to keep the family bungalow and custody of the children, and it may have been this that sparked Park's anger.

While in prison on remand in October 1997, he admitted the killing, telling fellow inmates 'she deserved it' after he discovered her in bed with another man.

Family members, however, never stopped believing in his innocence and campaigned for a retrial.

His children Jeremy, Rachael and Vanessa, and third wife Jenny, have campaigned tirelessly to prove his innocence since he was jailed.
