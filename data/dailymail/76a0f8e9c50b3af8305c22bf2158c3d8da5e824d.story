Tom Watson spoke glowingly on Wednesday morning of how Phil Mickelson has become a leader and of his ability to ‘talk smack’ — and it was not long before the Californian showed exactly what the US captain meant.

A few hours later the Californian took careful aim at Team Europe with a bit of ‘smack’ — banter —about how Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell are currently on the opposite sides of litigation proceedings involving management issues.

By doing so, Mickelson took it upon himself to signal the end of the studiously bland build-up to the Ryder Cup and demonstrate that, in the absence of Tiger Woods, he is a senior figure determined to avoid another reverse at the hands of Europe.

His observation, while delivered with a smile on his face, was clearly premeditated and designed to exploit a rare potential crack in the home team’s famously solid resolve.

Mickelson was not going to be deterred by the sensitivity of the situation involving McIlroy’s case against his former management company, with whom McDowell is so closely associated.

The 44-year-old American’s intervention also showed the well-disguised edge to his personality, for there was probably an element of retribution in the way he drew attention to what is an elephant inside the European team room.

Only Wednesday morning McIlroy joked about how, as a bystander, Mickelson ‘nearly hit me off the tee’ with a famously wayward drive in the 2004 Ryder Cup after a change of equipment saw him play poorly in that edition.

And then there was the world No 1’s observation two weeks ago that Mickelson and Woods may be playing the ‘last few holes’ of their top-flight golfing careers.

Mickelson does not see it that way, or it could just be that this week he feels emboldened by the absence of Woods — his old rival — in an event that has often seen him fail to demonstrate the true depth of his talent.

The five-times major winner took a questioner to task for suggesting that his Cup record was a ‘blot’ on his career, but over the 10 occasions he has played he has lost 55 per cent of his matches, more than any other man in the competition’s history.

Riling the European team is a high-risk strategy. Mickelson has little form coming to Gleneagles after a poor season in which a second place at the USPGA has been his only top 10 finish.

That is one reason why he is only one of the visiting team to hammer the underdog theme, something they clearly see as beneficial. 

On Wednesday, Paul Azinger, who in 2008 was the last player to captain a winning American team, put out a succinct tweet outlining what he sees as the required mentality in these fixtures: ‘This year @RyderCupUSA has a chip on its shoulder. Normally it’s @RyderCupEUROPE that plays with a chip. Team with biggest chip wins.’

Mickelson acknowledged that he has had a poor year but was defiant about his prospects. ‘I followed my worst year prior to this in 2003 with one of my best in 2004 and expect to do the same next year,’ he said.

More immediately, he agreed that he needs to do some repair work on his Ryder Cup record and confirmed that he will play alongside Keegan Bradley again in a repeat of their successful partnership of 2012.

Certainly, Scotland has been a place where he has triumphed before, having won the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart and The Open at Muirfield. In the absence of Woods, Jason Dufner and Dustin Johnson, the US team need Mickelson to perform and add a Ryder Cup to that.

He was happy to pursue the Band of Brothers theme: ‘It takes some of the pressure off, knowing that we are on away soil and that we haven’t won away for 20 years,’ he said.

‘The expectations aren’t high but rather than focus on what we don’t have, what we do have is a great group of 12 guys that really enjoy each other’s company and have a lot of fun together, and we have got great leadership.

‘It really has got nothing to do with trying to redeem what happened two years ago.’
