Tom Brokaw has opened up about his ongoing battle against bone cancer and said that he is aware of the toll it is taking on his family.

The NBC newsman spoke to his longtime friend David Letterman on his late night show Thursday and told how he has known about his diagnosis for seven months.

'It involves the whole family and it's tricky and it becomes a big strain,' he said.

Remaining optimistic: Tom Brokaw, who announced last month that he was diagnosed with a form of bone cancer, said that his doctors have given him a positive prognosis

'We've got the resources and access, and I've got this fabulous family, and so I am much more aware of what other families are going through.

'I'm so conscious of that every day.'

Brokaw is supported by his wife of 52 years, Meredith, their three daughters and five grandchildren.

The 74-year-old anchor publicly announced that he is being treated for multiple myeloma in February after keeping it quiet since his August diagnosis.

The disease affects blood cells in the patient's bone marrow. He is being treated at the famed Mayo Clinic and said that his doctors remain optimistic.

'I'm very pleased with the progress, and that's about as far as I want to go (publicly),' he said.

'As you know, I was keeping it as private as I possibly could, which I intend to continue doing.'

Support: Brokaw, 74, told Letterman that his family has been key to helping him through his treatment, as has his continued writing and work

Letterman pointed out that Brokaw has remained active throughout his treatment, and he said that he intends to continue.

â€˜Well, that's been therapy for me. I'm writing, I'm working, I've been on this broadcast, I've done other things at NBC- I want to have my other life,â€™ he said.

It comes as little surprise that Brokaw was comfortable talking about it to Letterman as the men have been good friends for years.

In addition to being two of the best-known figures in Manhattan media, they both also have ranches in Montana.

Brokaw bought a ranch in Livingston, Montana in 1989 and Letterman followed suit a decade later, buying his own home in Choteau, Montana.
