Chelsey Davy's revealing, figure-hugging outfit will most certainly have turned heads at the society wedding of Lady Melissa Percy and Thomas van Straubenzee.

And her appearance can even be compared to Pippa Middleton's scene-stealing display at the nuptials of Prince William and Kate.

Prince Harry's ex, who was one of Lady Melissa's bridesmaids, arrived at St Michael's Church in Northumberland wearing a very revealing, scoop-neck taupe-coloured full-length dress that perhaps gave away more than she bargained for.

Looking good: Chelsy Davy, the ex of Prince Harry, wore a figure-hugging dress designed by Bruce Oldfield, that emphasised her fabulous figure

The dress was designed by Bruce Oldfield with flowers she was pictured carrying by local florist Caro Dickinson, who has also decorated the church and castle.

It brings a flashback to the wedding of William and Kate, where it was the bride's sister Pippa who stole the show with a dress that emphasised her figure, and made her derrière world famous.

And Chelsy similarly showed off her fabulous figure in this outfit.

Remember this? Pippa Middleton raised plenty of eyebrows at the wedding of her sister Kate to Prince William, with her derrière making the headlines

Lady Melissa is a 26-year-old tennis coach while the groom is a chartered-surveyor and long-time friend of both William and Harry.

The brothers were at the 30-year-old's London stag do earlier this month.

Mr van Straubenzee travelled to New Zealand with William on a gap year and was reportedly on the phone to Harry when he was mugged in London last year. It was said that Harry alerted police and went out to find his friend after the ordeal.

Lady Melissa is the Duke of Northumberland's second daughter.

When her sister Lady Katie, a motorbike mechanic, married at St Michael's Church two years ago, Pippa Middleton was a guest. She is friends with Earl George Percy, the Duke's elder son.

Pippa Middleton also attended the wedding, and was greeted at the church gates by cries from the crowd of 'beautiful'.

She wore a blue and white floral dress with a hat.

Tara Palmer-Tompkinson had a little trouble as a gust of wind threatened to blow off her hat. She wore a blue and white striped suit.

Some of the male guests wore spats-type shoes for the posh event.

Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie added to the Royal contingent at the wedding.

Eugenie, in green, and Beatrice, in blue, were met with calls of gorgeous from the crown.

They hugged other guests at the gate before walking into the pretty church.

Uniformed police and plain clothes officers kept a close eye on the hundreds gathered to watch the procession.

Block heeled shoes, ankle-length dresses and samller hats were very in fashion. Pages and young bridesmaids were dressed as Robin Hoods and fairies in green.

Also in attendance was Prince Harry's 
current girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, who arrived at the ceremony with 
Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice.
