A defiant President Obama used his sixth State of the Union address to offer a litany of Democratic priorities that centered on tax increases on the wealthy intended to fund new social programs benefiting everyone else.

Unconcerned that he was addressing a Congress under full Republican control for the first time, the president danced around the outlines of his tax plan, dubbed a 'Robin Hood' approach by outraged Republicans that amounts to 'class warfare'.

Obama said: 'As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight.

Republicans, including House Speaker John Boehner (right), won't warm to Obama's plan to raise $320billion in new taxes to redistribute to poorer Americans

Obama launched his tax-grab plan in an address to a Congress under full Republican control for the first time

'They've riddled it with giveaways the super-rich don't need, denying a break to middle-class families who do.

'Let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one per cent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth,' the president demanded.

'We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college.

'Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?' he asked later in his address, 'or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?' 

Obama first wants to hike the capital gains rate on couples making more than $500,000 annually, from 20 to 28 per cent.

The White House has tried to sell the plan to the American people - and the Republicans - by pointing out that GOP standard-bearer Ronald Reagan once accepted the same tax rate for capital gains. 

But Obama neglected to add that the deal Reagan struck with congressional Democrats during the 1980s also set the top marginal income tax rate at 28 per cent. The top rate today in the United States is 39.8 per cent – a rate Republicans have long sought to bring down by arguing that lower tax rates encourage investment and job creation.

The president also wants to change the way taxes are calculated when an investor dies and bequeaths stocks to someone. 

Under current law, anyone who inherits stock is liable for taxes based on its original cost - not what it was worth when the original investor died. That, Obama's economic advisers insist, should change. 

The difference could be devastating for the children of America's smartest and most patient investors.

Stock bought decades ago for $10,000 and worth $200,000 at the time of death, for instance, would create a capital gains tax liability that's 20 times bigger under Obama's proposal – and heirs have to pay that tax when they inherit the stock.

The White House's plan also slaps a one-time fee on about 100 large U.S. investment banks and other giant financial firms with assets of $50billion or more.

The suggested fee on big banks is meant to discourage financial institutions from engaging in the risky behaviors that led to the 2008 crash, the White House says.

Obama hopes the new tax plans will raise $320 billion over 10 years – and wants to spend it right away.

His social program agenda includes a new $500 tax credit for many two-income households, an expanded tax credit for families who pay for child care, and an ambitious plan to pay for community college tuition in its entirety.

That plank of Obama's platform alone could cost $60 billion in its first decade, but some analysts claim the cost but even higher since community colleges could raise tuition fees as more government money enters the system.

Republican lawmakers sat on their hands as the president proposed a massive tax hike on investors and other wealthy Americans

Republicans declared the tax plan dead on arrival before Tuesday night's speech, even though it won't have a formal unveiling until the president's budget hits their desk on February 2.

'This is not a serious proposal,' Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee chairman Paul Ryan, told the Washington Post. 

'We lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler, flatter tax code, not big tax increases to pay for more Washington spending.' 

Wisconsin Republican Ryan slammed Obama on Fox News, accusing him of using 'class warfare rhetoric'.

'That's not presidential,' he said.

Virginia Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock told DailyMail.com that Obama's tax proposals will go nowhere.

'I think it's pretty clear that that’s a non-starter, and I think the president knows that,' Comstock said. 

'Those kind of tax increases would just be devastating to the economy. And you know we still have a very fragile economy.'

In a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, also levelled the 'class warfare' charge at the president.

Hatch has set his sights on reforming the tax code in a different way.

Obama's plan 'appears to be more about redistribution,' he said, which 'is unfortunate, because we’re going to need real leadership from the White House – not just liberal talking points – if tax reform is going to be successful.' 

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan slammed Obama afterwards for 'class warfare rhetoric'

Sen. Ted Cruz said Obama's 'more taxes' mantra was reminiscent of the Saturday Night Live 'More Cowbell' sketch featuring Christopher Walken

Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts governor who is weighing up a third run for the White House, slammed the president for 'ignoring the fact that the country has elected a Congress that favors smaller government and lower taxes'.

Romney's main competitor for Republican front-runner status, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, vented on Facebook.

'It’s unfortunate President Obama wants to use the tax code to divide us – instead of proposing reforms to create economic opportunity for every American,' he said.

'We can do better.'  

Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, the leading Democrat in line for Obama's job after 2016, tweeted that he had 'pointed way to an economy that works for all. Now we need to step up & deliver for the middle class.'

But Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz had mockery in mind.

He said on Fox News that Obama's reliance on the expansion of government social programs – and the tax hikes that go with them – was a modern political version of the classic Saturday Night Live sketch that featured actor Christopher Walken demanding 'more cowbell' as a solution to every problem faced by a rock band.

'For President Obama, "More cowbell" is "More taxes, more government; more taxes, more government",' Cruz said.
