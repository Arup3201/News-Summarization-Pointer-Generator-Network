The number of women in positions of power in the UK has plummeted causing a damaging effects on our country's social, cultural and political life, an influential new report has claimed today.

Researchers found female representation at senior levels of the judiciary, education, the arts, finance, the civil service and Government has gone into reverse.

The evidence is presented in a report by Counting Women
In, a coalition of five organisations including the Fawcett Society and
the Hansard Society.

Home Secretary Theresa May is one of a dwindling number of women in top jobs, according to a new report

In politics, the report finds that Britain has rapidly fallen down the international league tables for female democratic representation since Gordon Brown left power.

The former Labour Prime Minister had eight female cabinet ministers and there were 31 women in government.

Women now make up only 22.5 per cent of MPs; 12.3 per cent of council leaders (in England); and 17.4 per cent of the cabinet, the report says.

The study found Britain fell 37 places through the noughties, from 33rd place in 2001, to joint 60th in 2010. In western governments, only Ireland and Italy had fewer female representatives in 2010.

The Sex and Power 2013: Who Runs Britain? report, to be published tomorrow, found a similar trend at senior levels in the judiciary, education, the arts, finance, the civil service, the City and media.

The group was created after the 2010 general election to create annual reports modelled on the audits of public life that were published by the now defunct Equal Opportunities Commission.

Women are increasingly under-represented in the judiciary, according to Counting Women In

Nan Sloane, director of the Centre 
for Women and Democracy said: 'This report shows a shocking absence of 
women from powerful roles in Britain.

'We are often told that it's just a 
matter of time before we have equality, but we have already waited for 
generations; asking us to wait still more will change nothing, and the 
quality of decision-making in our democracy and public life will suffer 
as a result.

'There needs to be meaningful action now if next year's report is to show real progress.'

Only a third of public appointments are female, as are 15.6 per cent of high court judges and five per cent of editors of national daily newspapers.

In many areas, progress has shifted into reverse, such as in the devolved regional political bodies, where fewer women have been returned at recent elections.

Katie Ghose, chief executive of the 
Electoral Reform Society said: 'These missing women offer the most vivid
illustration of parliament's failure to keep up with the times.

While women are well represented in the teaching profession, the report says they are not at the upper echelons of the education sector

'Politicians will struggle to connect
with voters as long as the combined talents and perspectives of half 
the population are shut out. Party leaders admit there's a problem, but 
all have failed to find a lasting solution.

'It's not a good look for the Mother 
of all Parliaments to be left lagging behind on the fundamental issue of
women's representation.'

In Wales, the percentage of women elected has dropped from 50 per cent in 2004 to 40 per cent last year; in Scotland, the figure has dropped from 39.5 per cent to 34.9 per cent in the same time.

In a handful of other areas, progress has been made in the past decade, but with a long way still to go. Women now lead three in ten trade unions and membership is 50-50.

Ceri Goddard, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: 'It's simply scandalous fact that in 2013 men still outnumber women four to one in parliament. If political parties don't take urgent action, Britain will continue to fall down the global league table when it comes to women's access to power and representation in politics.

'The number of women in the Cabinet is at a ten year low. Failure to increase the number of women around the top table of politics sends a message to other walks of life and to the next generation for whom we hope for something different, that excluding women from positions of power is acceptable.

'Women's votes will determine the next election – remaining male dominated won't help the parties on polling day'

Ruth Fox, chief executive of the Hansard Society said: 'Parliament needs to show leadership in reflecting the people it governs and serves.

'Decisions made in Parliament affect women and men equally and the dearth of women in positions of political power not only reflects badly on the quality of our democracy, it also wastes the skill, expertise and life experience of half the population and sets a terrible example for other professions and industries.

'It's time for Parliament and political parties to take concrete steps to increase the number of women in politics.'

Alex Runswick, deputy director of Unlock Democracy, said: 'The lack of female involvement in UK politics is a canary in the mining shaft; it is a particularly visible example of how the system fails to represent people more widely.

'Our democracy and public life is weaker because it misses the skills  experience and talents of over half the population. It is not enough to recognise the problem and simply hope that things will improve; we need Parliament and politicians to take urgent action.'
