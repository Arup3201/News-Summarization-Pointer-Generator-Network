Police have appealed for help from the public in identifying four men captured on surveillance cameras near the murder scene of Ahmed Al-Jumaili, the Muslim man gunned down outside his apartment on Wednesday in a suspected hate crime.

Witnesses previously reported seeing four male suspects aged in their 20s enter the gates of the Walnut Bend Apartments complex in Dallas.

Al-Jumaili, 36 - an Iraqi newlywed who only moved to the United States 20 days earlier to be closer to relatives and start a new, safer life - was taking photos of his first snowfall when he was shot.

Now investigators believe they have found footage of the individuals responsible from nearby security cameras.

One of them captured appears to be holding a handgun by his side.

Possible involved: Witnesses previously reported seeing four male suspects aged in their 20s enter the gates of the Walnut Bend Apartments complex. Men fitting the description were captured on nearby cameras

The footage shows the men running through the snow separately. 

Crime Stoppers is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and indictment in the case., according to NBC DFW. 

The attack occurred on Wednesday night at 11.30pm.

Reports said the assailants were armed with rifles.

Al-Jumali was shot in the chest. 

He and his wife, Zahara, had fled the horrors of the Islamic State in Baghdad.  

Wife: Al-Jumaili, his wife, Zahara (photographed), and Al-Jumaili's brother went outside of his Dallas apartment to take pictures of the snow around 11.30pm when tragedy struck

In a detailed account of the incident posted on Facebook by Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in the Dallas and Fort Worth area, described the attack.

Salem writes that Al-Jumaili took cover behind a pickup truck when a group of five or six young African Americans opened fire.

A bullet pierced through the truck and struck Al-Jumaili in the chest, Salem said.

'There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots,' Salem wrote. 

'Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.'

Residents reported seeing two to four men entering the Walnut Blend Apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate prior to the shooting, CNN reported. 

An investigation is ongoing and police say it is unknown whether the incident was a hate crime.

Refuge: Al-Jumaili (right) and Zahara (left) married just 16 months ago, and the two planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State

A LaunchGood fundraising page tells the touching story of Al-Jumaili and Zahara. The two married just 16 months ago, and planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State.

Zahara relocated to Texas to be with family and Al-Jumaili stayed behind in Baghdad to save enough money to follow his wife.

After a year of separation, the two reunited three weeks ago, ready to begin a new chapter in their lives, away from the horrors of ISIS and other terrorist groups, only to experience tragedy in America.

Salem wrote on Facebook that only Al-Jumaili's stepfather, who lives in Dallas, is working and Al-Jumaili's death has left Zahara with not only an emotional burden, but a financial one as well.

The fundraiser has raised more than $9,000 toward Al-Jumaili's memorial and family fund.

Police say they have very little to go on in the investigation and are enlisting the help of the public to solve the crime.  

North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of $5,000 for information leading to an arrest or indictment. 

The attack has some Muslim activists shaken up, the Los Angeles Times reports, with some pointing to the recent murder of three Muslim students in North Carolina. 

The neighborhood where Al-Jumaili was killed has a large immigration population, according to the Times, and northern Dallas is home to a large number of Iraqi refugees.
