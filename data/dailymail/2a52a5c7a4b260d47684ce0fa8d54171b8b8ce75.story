Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond once appeared in an obscure Pakistani soap opera, it emerged today.

Mr Salmond, who is standing for Parliament in May, made a brief cameo appearance in 'The Castle' – a 15 part romantic thriller partially filmed in Scotland in 2001.

The former SNP leader said he was even given acting lessons by the  Hollywood star Sean Connery before he made his acting debut.

He was approached to appear in the soap by SNP activist Tasmina Sheikh - the show's producer who is married to the famous Bollywood producer Sulfkar - when Mr Salmond stood down as party leader the first time when he was an MP in 2000.

The soap was partly filmed partly at Scotland's Wedderburn Castle near Duns in the Borders.

The plot follows an Asian businessman who marries a Scot and inherits her family home after her death. Mr Salmond plays a ghost who guides him through his troubles while at the castle.

Despite the ghost's presence throughout the production, Mr Salmond's only personal appearance was in the last episode.

Mr Salmond, who is standing for Parliament in May, was even name-checked in the soap opera's credits

Mr Salmond told BuzzFeed News: 'My Bollywood cameo as a ghostly spirit was filmed the last time I stood down as SNP leader. This time round I'm hoping to haunt the House of Commons, rather like Banquo's ghost.

'It was, it has to be said, a non-speaking role – not one I hope to assume in Westminster.

'As you would expect, I took some acting lessons from Sean Connery at the time to make sure the audience was both shaken and stirred.'

The revelation comes as Mr Salmond plots his return to the House of Commons amid speculation he could even become Deputy Prime Minister in a Labour-led Government.

Mr Salmond and his successor as First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have vowed to implement left-wing policies on Tory England if the SNP holds the balance of power after the next election.

The former First Minister, who is standing for Parliament in May, said he would work with other parties except the Tories to 'see more progressive politics introduced across these islands'.

Mrs Sturgeon yesterday gave a speech in London warning Labour that it would have to abandon 'failed' austerity policies and back a £180billion spending splurge to form a coalition with the SNP after the election.

She said her party, which could hold the balance of power after May's general election, would require Ed Miliband to adopt a 'more moderate' approach to deficit reduction if he wanted the backing of SNP MPs in Westminster.

The First Minister suggested an alternative approach for the next parliament which would see £180 billion extra spent on public services by 2020.
