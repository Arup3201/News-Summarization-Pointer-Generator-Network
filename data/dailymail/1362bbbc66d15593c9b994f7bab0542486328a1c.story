A Chinese airline has launched a recruitment drive for married women with children to become 'flight aunties'.

Spring Air, China's biggest budget carrier, wants to recruit college-educated women aged betweenÂ  25 and 45 to become its latest flight attendants.

The airline, which is calling the role 'flight aunties' says applicants who are married with children will be given top consideration.

As reported by China Real Time Report, the new approach is a unique shift from the normal recruitment by China's state-owned carriers.

They place a heavy emphasis on youth 
and beauty with some airlines hosting pageant-style competitions to 
chose new flight attendants.

These attract thousands of applications from young women, who are attracted by the glamour and travel opportunities which airlines have to offer.

Spring Air's previous age cap for new
staff was 35.

But it said it was raising this to 45 following the results
of a recent survey which concluded that 72 per cent of people preferred to
be served by an experience flight attendant.

The airline says having a wider age profile among flight attendants will be beneficial. It said air hostesses who are younger are more enthusiastic while older ones can be more reliable and mature.

A statement by the airline added: 'We 
believe many woman have a dream to work in the aviation industry, no 
matter how old they are.'
