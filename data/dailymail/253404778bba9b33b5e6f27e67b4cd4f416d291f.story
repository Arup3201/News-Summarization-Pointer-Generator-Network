A cancer sufferer whose medical policy ran out half way through his treatment has shamed his insurance company into agreeing to pay his hospital bills - by targeting its CEO on Twitter.

Insurance company Aetna agreed to pay 'every last penny' of Arijit Guha's medical expenses after the student was left with a bill of $114,000 and rising.

The 31-year-old said he was 'in shell shock' and was relieved after the company's CEO Mark Bertolini agreed to pay out - despite the company telling him there would be a cap on his medical insurance policy.

In remission: Arijit Guha, an Arizona State University doctoral student, said he was in 'shell shock' at the decision

Arijit, a Phd student at Arizona State University, was aged 30 when discovered he had colon cancer after returning from a trip to India.

Stomach pain, which he initially thought was bug picked up on his trip, was diagnosed as stage four colon cancer a month later.

However, it was only after his diagnosis that he learned his insurance company were to restrict payment for his treatment.

While he was still able to receive life-saving treatment, Arijit - who is now in remission - had no way of paying for it and was facing potential medical bankruptcy.

Despite taking out a policy under the university's health plan, which cost him $400 a month, its carrier Aetna had an annual cap on pay-outs.

Arijit discovered soon after undergoing surgery and chemotherapy, he had exhausted his policy's lifetime limit of $300,000, ABC reported.

Arijit took to Twitter to highlight his case, out of frustration and desperation

Despite the law abolishing lifetime limits, under the Affordable Healthcare Act, this did not include student health plans until August 1.

Out of desperation and frustration, furious Arijit took to Twitter to highlight his case.

The company responded with this tweet: 'We care about members. We want you to be empowered to be healthy and make informed decisions.'

To which Arijit replied: 'That's so sweet that you want me to be 
empowered. Does [Mark Bertolini] care to empower me by paying my $118k - 
and counting - in bills?'

Other Twitter users waded in on the argument, many mocking the choice of words used by Aetna.

'It's a battle I never should have been waging, but things were what they were and I'm so absolutely thrilled we won!'

One user, @Chris_Ashworth posted: '[Aetna} want you to be *empowered to be healthy*! They are denying you coverage to *empower* you. See?'

Another, @ItsLerema tweeted: 'My bud, a PHD students with Stage 4 [cancer] was shamefully kicked off his insurance. Btw congrats [Mark Bertolini] on the $10.6m CEO salary.'

It was at this stage Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini responded to the tweets, denying Arijit had been kicked off his policy.

Arijit asked him: 'True or false: I am in this situation because your company offers a crappy product?'

And Bertolini replied: 'False. Why do you think the premium was so low? Do you look at your policy limits when you buy other insurance (auto)?'

The cancer sufferer than asked: 
'Moreover, isn't it morally reprehensible that you offer such a limit 
product? One that caps benefits so low?'

After a flurry of angry online exchanges continued between the two and their discussion then moved to the telephone.

Wading in: The online exchange prompted a series of angry tweets from other Twitter users

However, the next day Arijit made the announcement via his Facebook page that Aetna had backed down.

He wrote: 'Breaking news: Aetna just agreed to cover the full extent of my bills. Every last penny.It's a battle I never should have been waging, but things were what they were and I'm so absolutely thrilled we won!'

Before his victory with Aetna, Arijit had launched a fundraising campaign called Poop Strong - based on the cancer survivor Lance Armstrong's slogan of Live Strong.

He had managed to raise more than $100,000 by selling t-shirts with the Poop Strong logo on them to pay for any ongoing and future treatment - a sum he now plans to donate to charity now that Aetna has agreed to pay his bills.

CEO Bertolini - a former paramedic - later tweeted: 'The system is broken and I am committed to fixing it. I am glad we connected today and got this issue solved, I appreciate the dialogue no matter how pointed.'

Arijit told ABC News: 'I am incredibly pleased and in shell shock and trying to figure out what just happened. It's a huge relief.'
