Doris Paver, who is said to have died in squalid conditions at St James's Hospital in Leeds after staff failed to monitor her care 

A great grandmother who suffered from Parkinson's disease was repeatedly left semi-naked in soiled bedding by hospital carers in the weeks leading up to her death.

Doris Paver 79, died at St James's Hospital in Leeds, where it is claimed staff failed to monitor her care and even subjected her to an unnecessary surgical procedure.

Mrs Paver was admitted to the West Yorkshire hospital after collapsing at her nursing home in Leeds, and later developed several pressure ulcers and a severe bed sore.

It is claimed she was stripped of her dignity after being left in a state of undress in soiled bedding on several occasions while in the hospital's care.

There were also concerns that her feeding tube was fitted inappropriately into her stomach and that staff failed to control her pain.

Her daughter Valerie King also alleged that the hospital took longer than needed to provide a specialist mattress. 

She also added that staff failed to keep records on how often she was turned over to prevent further ulcers.

Mrs King, 56, was awarded a four-figure pay-out from Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust after consulting solicitors.

Now she has hit out at the Trust, who she says failed to provide basic care, which in turn contributed to her mother's death in May 2011.

She said: 'It was stressful enough dealing with the emotional strain of a sick mother, without the added worry about her physical well-being, a lack of adequate pain management and a loss of dignity for the duration of her stay.

'It was clear to me from the outset that mum was not getting the proactive support she desperately needed from the nursing and medical teams.'

Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust has now apologised to Mrs Paver's family for the treatment she received at St James's Hospital, pictured 

Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust has now apologised for the treatment of Mrs Paver while she was in their care from March 2011.

They also added that they hoped to learn from previous failures.

Chief nurse Suzanne Hinchliffe said: 'We recognise that, regrettably, certain aspects of Mrs Paver's care did not meet the high standards that we aim to achieve and were below the standard that she and her family were entitled to expect.'

While James Thompson, medical negligence solicitor at Simpson Millar's in Leeds, who handled the case added: 'Mrs Paver suffered throughout with poorly controlled pain, a dry mouth and was left in soiled bedding with little respect to her dignity.

'This is a very sad case and the family hope that as a result of bringing these issues to the fore, the Trust will offer training and reassurance that there will not be a recurrence of such inadequate hospital care.'
