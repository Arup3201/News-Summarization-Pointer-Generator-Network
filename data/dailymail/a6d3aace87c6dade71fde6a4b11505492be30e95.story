It sounds like there are no rules outside the kitchen for Manu Feildel after a raucous night out with some pals ended with the police being called.

The celebrity chef who stars in hit television show My Kitchen Rules, was given a bad review by neighbours after he served up some unruly behaviour that kept them awake in the early hours of Sunday morning.    

Two furious neighbours, who preferred to remain anonymous, told Daily Mail Australia that Feildel and three friends were 'yelling and screaming' at an apartment in Ben Buckler, North Bondi.

'To be involved in something like this where he's disturbing people in the middle of the night is unbelievably bad behaviour,' one neighbour told Daily Mail Australia.

'Here he is on television being portrayed as this respectable guy when he’s behaving like this. The fact that he’s bothering other people like this is not good enough.'

The man renting the apartment only moved in this week and he is believed to be an employee at North Bondi Fish restaurant owned by another celebrity chef Matt Moran in North Bondi.

Neighbours complained that they heard 'yelling and screaming' at the apartment Feildel was in

'They kept everyone in the area awake. After the police arrived they were quiet though,' the neighbour said.

Another neighbour said she could hear the revelry from across the street and that it was 'obviously a boy’s own night out'. 

'They were screaming and shouting on the balcony. Manu was the ring leader. They were acting like teenagers – climbing on the balcony, gyrating and yelling out. They were very, very loud. It went on for hours,' the neighbour told Daily Mail Australia.

'It went on from about 10pm to 2.30am. I was surprised he was part of all this. It was just three or four grown men just going off.'

Police confirmed that a a noise complaint was made and they visited the apartment.

The My Kitchen Rules judge, 41, shared the news on social media, and Instagrammed the tiny feet of his newborn.

'Welcome to the new love of our lives into this world,' Feildel captioned the picture.

Daily Mail Australia tried to contact Feildel and his PR for a response but none was forthcoming.
