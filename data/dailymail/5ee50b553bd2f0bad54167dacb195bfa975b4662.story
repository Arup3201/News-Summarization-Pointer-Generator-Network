A new app allows users to assess their love life at a glance by highlighting positive and negative patterns on a color-coded calendar.

Users of The Boyfriend Log are instructed to write a brief sentence summarizing how they feel about their relationship each day, marking it green for 'amazing', orange for 'happy', blue for 'sad' and red for 'angry.'

If their calendar shows more red than green, the app's creator, 49-year-old Linda Sivertsen, says it's probably time to call it quits and find someone who will have a more positive impact.

Green for amazing, blue for sad: A new app allows women to assess their love life at a glance by highlighting positive and negative patterns on a color-coded calendar

The California-based mother-of-one came up with the idea for a digital love diary after her actor husband of 19 years, Mark, left her for another woman.

She said over the years there were lots of signs that something was wrong, but she chose to ignore them and remember happier times.

Helping others: The Boyfriend Log instructs users to rate how they feel about their relationship each day using colors - it was invented by Linda Sivertsen, 49, who was devastated when her husband of 19 years left her

When she 
found herself dating again for the first time in her mid-forties, she 
said she was determined to create something that would help her to 
'visualize the patterns' easily.

In
 a Vimeo video promoting her app - which was downloaded 359 times in 
less than a week when it launched on April 30 - Ms Sivertsen tells 
viewers that 'seeing is believing' and 'clarity is queen.'

Source of inspiration: Ms Sivertsen's ex-husband, Mark, who cheated on her

She
 continues: 'This time I was accountable to the patterns, I could trust 
myself to be my own eye-witness. When the next relationship came around,
 truth was on my side.'

Ms Sivertsen, who also works as an author, has now been with another man for about four years - and she credits The Boyfriend Log for that relationship's success.

The app took five months to produce and is now on sale on iTunes for $1.99.

One happy purchaser said: 'I’m a person who needs visual proof in order for my mind to accept something - and potentially change it.

'This app does that in a way that makes things very clear. And using it is really easy. Thank you for making it!'

And another said that they had been using it to rate their progress at work: 'I am in sales and rating my behavior for the day,’ they wrote. ‘Did I make my calls etc. this is fabulous! Immensely helpful.'
