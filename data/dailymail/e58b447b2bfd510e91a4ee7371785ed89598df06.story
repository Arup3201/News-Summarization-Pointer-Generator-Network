As women hit their half century, skin begins to sag, fine lines appear and confidence levels often drop as a result.

But how do you beat the wrinkles and give your skin a surge of life without turning to plastic surgery?

One beauty company thinks it has the answer to help diminish the signs of mature skin by combating the signs of menopause.

The new anti-ageing cream? Rodial has unveiled Cougar Collection - a range of skin creams designed to beat wrinkles by combatting the signs of menopause on the skin

The Rodial Cougar Collection range claims to target the signs of menopause, which founders say requires particular attention beyond regular anti-ageing needs.

The beauty brand, favoured by the likes of Jessica Biel and Lady Gaga, has developed a capsule range of three products to respond to the direct effects hormonal change can have on the skin using ingredients that are specific to helping skin control functions lost as we age.

Speaking about her brainchild, which goes on sale in Harrods today and is priced between £75-£150, founder of Rodial, Maria Hatzistefanis, said: 'One
 side-effect of menopause is a reduction of estrogen production, 
resulting in a loss of supportive function below the skin allowing 
sagging wrinkles to appear with loss of mobility, creating a "crepy" 
texture', explains Maria.

'Protein synthesis, particularly that 
of collagen and elastin, are partially controlled by estrogens. Thus, 
during menopause, the lowered estrogen levels result in less production 
and repair of collagen and elastin in the dermis of the skin.

'A normal anti-ageing cream 
is not going to help when the cause of the problem is a drop in the level of 
hormones. We are addressing the cause of the problem and expecting a 
better anti-ageing result as opposed to using a conventional 
anti-ageing product.'

How does it work? Menopause causes a reduction of estrogen production, resulting in a loss of supportive function below the skin allowing sagging wrinkles to appear with loss of mobility, creating a crepy texture, which the cream claims to combat

The secret ingredient in the trio of creams - one for face, one for body and one serum,  is wild yam, which the brand say has been used as a natural alternative supplement to estrogen therapy for years.

A study by Komesaroff et al, entitled Effects of wild yam extract on menopausal symptoms, lipids and sex hormones in healthy menopausal women, found that that short-term treatment with topical wild yam extract in women suffering from menopausal symptoms left them free of side-effects.

Explaining
 this ingredient choice, Maria said: 'The drop in oestrogen that happens
 from the age of 35 onwards is a major cause of skin ageing. My theory 
is that if you can trick the skin into thinking that hormones are back 
to the pre-35 levels, the ageing process can be reversed.

Secret ingredient: The range is packed with wild yam, which the brand say has been used as a natural alternative supplement to estrogen therapy

'By
 having the skin believe it's receiving more estrogen from the natural 
alternative wild yam, it  produces more collagen.'

It
 is also packed with black cohosh, which claims to help control sebum 
production that can be a side-effect of hormonal change on the skin.

'Combined with black cohosh, which helps control sebum 
production, the skin is significantly and cosmetically enhanced during 
and post menopause,' said Maria.

This
 isn't the first time that Rodial has developed a product like this, a 
few years ago the company brought out the Bee Venom range, which was used cosmetically to 'fool' the skin into thinking it had been lightly stung with the toxin melittin.

This
 causes the body to direct blood towards the area and stimulates the 
production of the naturally-occurring chemicals collagen and elastin.

Maria concluded: 'When we started developing a range for
 mature skin, we wanted to get the message across that when you reach 
your 50s, 60s and beyond, this is the time to celebrate your life, your 
skin and your body.

'To
 us the word "cougar" is a term that has nothing to do with a younger 
boyfriend and everything to do with taking control of your life and 
being the best that you can be. We want to empower women, offer them the
 best skincare and a positive message about this beautiful time in their
 lives.'
