Noordhuizen is seven months into her pregnancy and suffered minor injuries, The Tampa Bay Times reported on Tuesday.

Citing an arrest report, the newspaper said Noordhuizen claimed the couple had a dispute and she took off - and claimed Colby told her in a phone call 'Are you ready for your abortion date?'

The alleged attempted murder took place Monday at approximately 1pm near a U.S. 19 Toyota dealership, The Tampa Bay Times reported. Colby returned to his nearby home and took off on his motorcycle, the Florida Highway Patrol told the newspaper.

Witness Jessica Austin told WSPA 'All I could hear was, him screaming "Oh no, Oh no, Oh no." 

'And I ran outside and he was running out and, um, he's like "I know I'm going to jail, I know I'm going to jail." And I started screaming at him. I'm like "You can't run away, you can't run away."'

Taking off: Later, a man can be seen in the surveillance video driving in reverse, exiting the vehicle and then walking away from the scene (far right) 

Confrontation: Colby and Noordhuizen are said to have had a  dispute before the incident and she took off. Noordhuizen has claimed that Colby told her in a phone call 'Are you ready for your abortion date?'

Dealership employee and Witness Ralph Estevez told WPTV 'She hit - she just flew forward. If the pole wasn't there, that guy would have just kept running her over.'

Estevez said after the man noticed people nearby, 'He freaked out, and started punching his - the top of his car and just started walking away. And we started following him, me and a few guys.'

WSPA reported that on Monday evening, Colby turned himself in to authorities.

Colby's booking page with the Pasco County Sheriff's Office shows that he is facing an attempted murder charge and charge for attempting to kill an unborn child by injury to the mother.

Records show Colby is currently being held in jail, with his bail set at $500,000.
