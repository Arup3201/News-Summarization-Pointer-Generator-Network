Lufthansa is refuting passengers’ claims they spent five hours Tuesday night stuck on a tarmac without food or water only to return to the gate.

The roughly 300 people expecting to fly Tuesday from Boston Logan Airport to Frankfurt during a snow storm fell victim to a ‘unique’ series of events that led to them not being fed or given water during an evening most would prefer to forget.

An airline spokesperson rebutted to MailOnline claims of starvation and thirst, and offered an explanation as to why full meals weren’t served during the lengthy delay.

Passengers streaming off the doomed flight complained to WCVB of the uncomfortable conditions.

‘We’re told we can't put our seat back, that we can't use our cellphone, we can't go to the bathroom except for emergency, can't loiter in the aisles,’ Deamiana Andoneva griped.

Lufthansa spokesperson Nils Haupt told MailOnline that people were allowed to use their phones and go to the bathroom, but were restricted in their movements around the cabin because of space constraints.

‘Everyone was allowed to use the restroom, everyone was allowed to use their phones,’ he said. ‘You wouldn’t allow people to walk around inside the cabin freely because of the size of the cabin.’

Shawn Cabral complained of being given very little water and fed only small bags of crackers.

‘They offered us a little plastic cup of water and one little bag of Goldfish crackers shaped like airplanes,’ said Mr Cabral.

Back problems: This pregnant passenger complained of intense back pain after not being allowed to put her seat back during the delay

The culprit: Both Lufthansa and Massport, which runs Logan Airport, blamed a broken snow plow similar to this one for marooning the plane

A pregnant woman told of her discomfort, saying she was 'in terrible back pain.'

Lufthansa spokesperson Nils Haupt told MailOnline that a broken snow plow was partly to blame for the delay, something Massport officials confirmed to WCVB.

A MailOnline message left for further comment from the agency went unreturned.

Further complicating issues, Mr Haupt explained, was the lack of lighting on the runway. A separate vehicle was needed to light the taxiway as the plane made its way to de-icing.

The snow plow broke on the way to deicing, stranding the plane while emergency repairs were made, according to Mr Haupt.

The airport received just under five inches of snow during the storm, according to the National Weather Service.

This led to the uncertainty about whether or not the flight would leave – causing the flight crew to follow what he claims are established protocols in the airline industry.

Hot food could not be served to 300 people because the plane cannot take off while people are eating.

Chaos: The airport was blanketed Tuesday with almost five inches of snow, wreaking havoc on many flights

‘You could serve warm food, what would happen if the snow plow was taken away and you could take off – it would take one hour to clear away the food’ the spokesperson explained.

The decision to return to the gate was made just before 7.30, but no gates were available, according to Mr Haupt.

‘The airport was chaos,’ he added.

The plane was granted a gate just before 9pm, but then there was a problem with the luggage.

The airline’s crew was busy with another plane, and only one luggage cart was available to use. Each luggage cart holds roughly 15 pieces, Mr Haupt said.

Peace offering: The airline put everyone affected into hotel rooms for the night and booked them on flights the following day or two days later

 ‘We were told our baggage would be in in 20 minutes,’ Mr Cabral told WCVB. ‘After 20 minutes, they repeated it, another 20 minutes, another 20 minutes.’

‘At 1.30 in the morning, we finally got our luggage.’

Mr Haupt apologized for the unusual series of events that led to the extreme delay. All passengers were given hotel rooms and booked on flights either Wednesday or Thursday, he added.

‘I know it’s an annoyance… we deeply apologize for what happened,’ he said. ‘It added up and I am really extremely sorry… sometimes things go wrong and this time everything went wrong.’
