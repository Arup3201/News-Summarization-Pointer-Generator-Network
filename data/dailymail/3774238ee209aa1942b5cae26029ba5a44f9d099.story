Frank Lampard is being lined up as Sky Sports’ latest big-name signing as the Manchester City midfielder weighs up whether to move into broadcasting once his stellar playing career finally ends.

Lampard will feature in Sky’s Champions League coverage for the round of 16 later this month. 

The former England midfielder is using his maiden appearances as a pundit to see how much he likes the job before he starts his Major League Soccer career in July with New York City.

Sky have recently added Thierry Henry to their cast as they compete with BT Sport for football broadcasting supremacy. 

The two TV heavyweights, along with newcomers Discovery and beIN Sports, are negotiating with the Premier League over the rights to show live matches between 2016-19 in an auction that could cost over £4billion.

Sky’s stable of pundits includes Henry, Graeme Souness, Gary Neville and Sportsmail duo Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher.

Blame lies with Blatter

FIFA president Sepp Blatter is being blamed for the organisation’s executive committee attempting to derail the emergency loan system which is critical to the Football League.

The short-term loan window that opens next Tuesday for six weeks is vital for cash-strapped lower-league clubs to bring in players they can’t commit to signing and allows top-flight reserves to gain valuable game time.

The process, which FIFA intend to terminate at the end of this season, has the support of the FA, Premier League, Football League and other leagues around Europe, as well as FIFA’s administrators and their players status committee.

But it was still rejected by the executive at their last meeting in Marrakesh with Blatter, who is perceived to have an anti-English stance, seen as the main opponent, supposedly on the grounds of competition integrity.

The move affects the English game far more than anywhere else and the Football League will discuss their next move at forthcoming club and board meetings.

No wonder the FA are committed to UEFA’s three-horse strategy, with Luis Figo, Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein and Michael van Praag all on the same ‘change needed’ message that ‘Anyone But Blatter’ should be the next FIFA president.

 Home comforts

West Ham are already gaining the benefit of renting the Olympic Stadium on very favourable terms from the 2016-17 season. 

The new three-and-a-half-year shirt sponsorship deal with online gaming platform Betway, which will take in the first two seasons in Stratford, is understood to be worth £6m a year. 

That is three times the value of their previous agreement with Alpari and the biggest commercial deal in the club’s history.

Granovskaia the top dog

Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia, who represents Roman Abramovich on the board, must now rank above West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady as the most powerful woman in English football. 

Chelsea’s revamped management structure has Granovskaia in control of transfer negotiations to remarkable effect. 

The club made a decent profit in the last window by selling Andre Schurrle and Ryan Bertrand for top dollar and getting a loan fee for Mohamed Salah. This follows persuading Paris Saint-Germain to pay nearly £50million for David Luiz last summer.

Splashing the cash 

The Welsh Rugby Union are said to have pushed the boat out for the visiting RFU council at their dinner at Celtic Manor on Thursday night — with the wives entertained at a different restaurant at the golf resort. 

The largess follows Welsh gratitude at having eight World Cup matches in Cardiff despite England being the tournament hosts.

Dan Ashworth was forced to explain himself from the power above about his plans for 'England DNA'

Meanwhile there is some frustration at England Rugby 2015 over World Cup sponsors taking their time to hand back seats they don’t want.

ER 2015 want as much time as possible to sell the returned tickets, especially in difficult venues like Leicester, where the Tigers’ opposition to the matches being staged at football’s King Power Stadium is still an issue.

FA technical director Dan Ashworth’s ‘England DNA’ strategy, under which all national teams from junior to senior have the same approach, was first outlined to the FA board after the World Cup and was so well received that he now has full control of the process. 

But the blazers on the grassroots national game board needed another talk from Ashworth to grasp what he is trying to put in place. 

Board chairman Roger Burden told colleagues: ‘We have heard a lot about this topic without necessarily understanding DNA. Dan Ashworth joined us to explain that it is all about keeping the coaches and playing style the same throughout the playing levels.’
