Councillor Colin Payne has been paid thousands of pounds in allowances while living with his wife in the Philippines

A councillor has claimed more than £10,000 in allowances while living with his new wife in the Philippines.

Colin Payne, 58, has spent much of the past two years in Manila with Jackie, the Filipino bride he met on holiday.

In that time he has attended only seven of a possible 24 meetings of his council in Devon, blaming tropical storms for his failure to show up.

He has still pocketed £9,140 in allowances and a £1,806 special responsibility payment for sitting on North Devon District Council’s executive committee.

Yesterday the Liberal Democrat was facing a motion of no-confidence from members of his own party.

They say he has spent just five months in the UK over the past two years.

In a statement they said: ‘His constituents have been unable to contact him and he has been unable to carry out his councillor duties.’

Des Brailey, who leads the Conservative group on the council, said: ‘He has been absent from a lot of meetings and if he’s not here then he can’t properly represent his residents.

‘If it was one of my councillors I’d be having a stern word with them.’

Mr Payne, who has three children from his first marriage, said he had spent so much time 7,000 miles away because his 48-year-old wife had been denied a UK visa.

A two-month summer trip to be with her had to be extended, he said, because typhoons had grounded international flights.

He added: ‘Nine tenths of councillors’ work these days is via email. I haven’t stopped doing that.

‘Most meetings are lip service, rubber stamping. I was conscious I couldn’t get to any meetings and so I took the decision to step down from the executive committee.

‘I was taking money for nothing and couldn’t do that job properly.

‘I’ve been a councillor for 30 years and until this year I could count the number of meetings I’ve missed on one hand.’

Mr Payne met his wife four years ago in Singapore while he was travelling home from watching cricket in Australia.

The couple would be together in Devon but for their spouse visa ‘nightmare’, he said.

‘She’s had visitor visas but we’ve had to move between the two countries. I’m honest and open about it,’ he added. ‘For the first time in 30 years I’ve had a personal problem.’

Mr Payne said his previous marriage broke down ten years ago in part because of his workload as a councillor and as owner of a fire safety business in Barnstaple.

He added: ‘For 29 years my attendance record was exemplary but four years ago I was fortunate enough to meet a beautiful, amazing woman. Jackie and I became friends, we spent some holidays together, she then got a visa as a visitor, and gradually we grew closer which culminated in our marriage in December 2011.’

His wife, a mother of two, works as an English translator in the Philippines.

Mr Payne, who was re-elected in May 2011, attended just one executive committee meeting.
