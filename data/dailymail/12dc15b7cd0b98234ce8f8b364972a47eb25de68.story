From Zac Efron's flip flop fetish to Jamie Oliver's Jesus sandals, there's no getting away from the mandal' - or men's sandal - which is one of this season's biggest trends.

The summery shoes were spotted at Valentino, Vivienne Westwood and Lanvin - among many others - and have since been seen adorning the extremities of most of the A-list. Even Barack Obama is partial to exposing his toes in public.

Clearly, sandals - be they flipflops, Birkenstocks, or more delicate, leather-strapped affairs - are a fashion force to be reckoned with. But they are also a sartorial minefield. What about socks? Are hairy toes allowed? Can real men have pedicures?

Mr Porter Editor-in-chief, Jeremy Langmead, cleared up a few issues in an article for the Times Saturday Magazine. He advises that you 'handle your mandal with care.'

Rule number one is no socks, despite attempts by Lanvin - among others - to convince the world that the style beloved by grandads on the beach looks acceptable.

'Black socks, shorts and sandals will make you look like an Austrian Montessori teacher,' revealed Robert Johnston of British GQ in the Times.

As Nick Clegg discovered when he was ridiculed for sporting chunky sandals while on holiday earlier this summer, velcro straps and big buckles don't cut it either.

Instead, says Langmead, keep them plain and stick to dark colours such as black or brown leather. 'Team with looser rather than tighter trousers,' he adds, ' and avoid any that look orthopaedic.'

Finally, while your mandals might be slick, if your feet are less than lovely, it's time to put those toes away.

As Langmead puts it: 'There are two fictional characters it's vital you don't emulate: Bilbo Baggins ('Filthy little hobbitses') or hippy Keith from Mike Leigh's 1976 classic Nuts In May.'

In short: 'Make sure your feet are in good shape: toenails need to be clean and short, calluses erased, dry skin buffed and excessive hair removed.'

So do your man's match up? If not, it might be best to plump for a nice pair of loafers instead.
