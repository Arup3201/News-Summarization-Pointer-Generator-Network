Michael Newman's son died of head injuries in the 2012 crash in Caversham

A father whose dangerous driving in an illegally modified car caused the death of his three-year-old son demonstrated negligence and a lack of responsibility, a Perth judge says.

Michael Brian Newman was driving with two other adults and his son Dre, who was in a booster seat in the rear of the vehicle, when he lost control and crashed into a tree in Caversham in May 2012.

The boy died from head injuries.

Newman pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial last month to a charge of dangerous driving causing death.

During sentencing submissions in the Perth District Court on Tuesday, his lawyer said Newman was 'extremely remorseful' and pleaded for 'mercy' and a spent conviction. But the prosecution argued an immediate term of imprisonment was appropriate.

The court heard a $200 modification to the Holden Commodore, which caused both rear wheels to turn at the same speed, made the car unroadworthy and dangerous.

Newman changed from third to second gear and then accelerated, causing the rear wheels to lose traction with the road and spin before hitting the tree, the court heard.

Judge John Wisbey said Newman 'didn't give proper thought to the consequences' of having mechanics fit the spool, and it amounted to a 'serious level of negligence' and a lack of responsibility.

He said the victim impact statement from the child's mother depicted the obvious devastation a mother would feel under such circumstances.

The court heard Newman, who wept throughout the proceedings, had made two attempts on his life since the incident and was plagued by nightmares.

Newman had his bail extended until his sentencing on Wednesday.
