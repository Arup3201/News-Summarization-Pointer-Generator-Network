A glorious full moon rises over New York City

It has earned the colorful name 'Pink Moon', but not for its appearance

The name derives from the pink flowers of spring

The moon takes on a pink glow as it rises in the post-sunset sky

The New York City skyline has the ability to take ones breath away at almost any time of day, but it is after dark when the shimmering lights of Manhattan's skyscrapers really stand out against the night sky.

Those looking eastwards at the skyline from New Jersey last night were treated to a 'pink moon' rising in between the buildings.

Traditionally, the April full moon is known as "the Pink Moon," supposedly as a tribute to the Grass Pink Orchids or Wild Ground Phlox, considered one of the earliest widespread flowers of the spring.

The moon is particularly colourful as it is rising or setting for the same reason that sunrise and sunsets are red and orange.

When the moon is near the horizon, the moonlight must pass through much more atmosphere than when the moon is directly overhead.

The moon appears to glow red as the reflected light from the sun is scattered and refracted by thick layers of atmosphere.

By the time the moonlight reaches our eyes, the blue, green, and purple
pieces of visible light have been scattered away by air molecules.

That's why you only see yellow, orange, or red.

It is also caused by the dust particles and other pollutants in the air.

The phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering and makes for a beautiful sight both for our eyes and as shown here, the camera lens too!

Why does the moon look orange or pink? This is because the light from the moon passes through a thick layer of atmosphere which refracts the sunlight reflecting off of the moon as it is rising. This combined with air pollution provides its distinct colour

A supernatural delight: The moon appears to be as bright as some of the tallest buildings and busiest parts of New York City. The brightness of Times Square can be seen directly below the moon's rays

A fine and natural sight: New York City bathed in the moonlight

80s lyrics come to mind: When you get caught between the moon and New York city...
