An out-of-control satellite plummeting to Earth at 18,000mph could land almost anywhere this evening –  excluding North America, Nasa warned tonight.

The craft, which is the size of a bus, will break up on entering Earth’s atmosphere, flinging huge chunks of metal weighing up to 350lb across hundreds of miles.

NASA said it will only know two hours before impact where it will land – and even that prediction will only be accurate to the nearest 6,000 miles. It could be anywhere between the 57th parallel north, which crosses Britain at around Inverness, and the 57th parallel south, which passes just below South America.

But the U.S. could breathe a sigh of relief today after learning the space junk will not be anywhere near its airspace when it comes down.

Incredibly, the plummeting six-ton satellite has been caught on film.

Astrophotographer Thierry Legault's clip, shot in northern France, shows the 20-year-old Upper Atmosphere 
Research Satellite (UARS), 
appearing as a beaming mass of light as it careers  to Earth.

Nasa orbital debris scientist Mark 
Matney admitted: ‘We know it is going to hit somewhere between 57 north 
and 57 south, which covers most of the inhabited world, unfortunately.’

Danger: The six-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite will crash to Earth and could land in Britain

Best guess: The satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes, where billions of people live

However, scientists have ruled out the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite striking North America.

Its orbit was been altered by Nasa 
deliberately to make it crash – but it is now coming down sooner than 
expected due to changed atmospheric conditions.

It is falling to Earth at five miles 
per second, faster than previously thought and experts say there is a 
one in 3,200 chance of someone being hit by debris – more likely than 
getting a hole in one during a round of golf.

The 35ft Nasa craft, which weighs 
6.5tonnes, was put into space in 1991 to monitor climate change, and 
ceased operations in 2005.

The falling satellite will look like a fiery meteor shower as it begins to burn up in the atmosphere.

It is expected to break into more 
than 100 pieces with most of it being destroyed before it hits the 
ground. But around 26 pieces are expected to make it through and the 
heaviest metal parts are expected to reach Earth, including titanium 
fuel tanks.

Nasa spokesman Steve Cole said: 
‘Anybody who finds a piece of the satellite should stay away from it and
 call the police and let them deal with it.

‘It could be very hot or it could be 
dangerous. It depends on what speed the debris is going, but it could go
 be going fast enough to go through a house.

‘We will have to wait and see if the 
debris creates a crater. If it is spherical that is possible but if it 
has a less regular shape it may not be going so fast.’

Mr Cole added that more accurate predictions are expected throughout today and will be posted on Nasa’s website.

Debris routinely falls to Earth from 
space but the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite will be the biggest 
Nasa craft to fall uncontrolled from space in 32 years.

In 1979 Skylab, which was 15 times 
bigger, rained charred chunks on the Indian Ocean and western Australia 
after Nasa said it would land in South Africa.

In 2003 when the space shuttle 
Columbia exploded upon re-entry killing its entire crew, large chunks of
 its shell landed across Texas.
