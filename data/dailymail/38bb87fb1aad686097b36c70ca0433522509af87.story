A man whose partner died in a New Year's Eve fire at their home just hours after the couple became engaged has spoken of his heartache.

Bart Somers survived the blaze which tore through the block of flats where he and his partner, George Michael Somers, lived after waking to find the property filled with smoke.

The 37-year-old was safely pulled from the burning building in Plymouth, Devon, but said he has 'lost everything' upon learning of the death of his partner and their dogs.

Just hours before the man's death he had proposed to Mr Somers. 

'George had proposed on New Year’s Eve which makes this even worse because he hadn't wanted to get married and didn’t believe in it…and then he proposed.'

The couple had fallen asleep on their sofa when Mr Somers awoke to smoke and flames consuming the property. 

'We had a bit to drink and we sat down on the sofa holding hands.

'I think we fell asleep.All I remember is shouting at him at the top of my voice and hitting him [to try and wake him up].

'The next thing I knew I was dragging him out of the front room.

'He's 6ft 2ins, and about 11 weeks ago I had my gall bladder removed and I was still in a bit of pain so couldn't lift him.

'I don't remember anything between getting him into the hallway and being put into a car and going to the police station.'

The couple owned three dogs and a cat and two of their dogs, a chihuahua and a pomeranian, also died in the blaze.

The cause of the fire, which was reported at about 2am at a block of flats in Plymouth, Devon, on Thursday, is still under investigation.

Around 40 people were evacuated from the block of flats. Four residents and one police officer were treated by paramedics.
