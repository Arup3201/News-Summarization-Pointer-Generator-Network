When Isabel Gratton heard her favourite play area could be built over for a housing estate she was determined to stop it happening.

Despite being only nine, the schoolgirl went to a public meeting with other ‘Save the Green’ campaigners – and was so impressive she was chosen to make the key final speech to councillors.

Not only did Isabel write the speech herself, but she moved the planning committee chairman to tears with her emotional and word perfect address. 

Moving words: Isabel Gratton, of Rotherham, helped fight off developers hoping to concrete over her favourite play area by reducing the planning boss to tears in a two-minute speech

Thanks in no little part to her efforts, Rotherham Council unanimously rejected the application to build 21 houses on the plot of land in the village of Thurcroft, South Yorkshire.

Isabel, who lives a few yards from the green, said she was ‘really upset’ about the proposed scheme because the play area ‘means so much to me’.

She was determined to do her bit, writing a letter of objection and then bravely speaking in front of around 100 people at the town hall.

Jumping for joy: The bright young girl, pictured on The Crescent, in the village of Thurcroft, wrote the speech without any help from her parents

She said: ‘I think my speech made the difference because I saw the chairman crying. I think more children should speak about important issues.

‘I enjoyed speaking to these people and I would like to be a councillor when I grow up.

‘I was a bit nervous but I tried to speak loudly and clearly so everyone could hear me.’

Her father Paul Gratton, 41, a steelworks manager, said Isabel and his son Jacob, 13, played regularly on the green with their friends. ‘It is safe, it’s away from the road and there are benches so parents can keep an eye on younger children,’ he said. 

Reduced to tears: Planning Board chairman Councillor Alan Atkin, above, who has two daughters himself, cried after watching Isabelle deliver a speech in her bid to save the green

‘When Isabel found out someone wanted to build houses there she said that wouldn’t be fair on the children and she decided to do her bit.

‘She wrote her own speech – her mum and I didn’t help her at all. It was a good effort by the campaigners but someone said afterwards that Isabel’s speech was the cherry on the top.

‘I think it’s amazing that she had the confidence to stand up in front of all those people.’

Planning chairman Councillor Alan Atkin, who has two young daughters himself, said later: ‘I don’t mind admitting that I shed a few tears after Isabel spoke.

‘I am a bit of a big softie but it’s the first time I have ever been in tears at a planning meeting.’

Councillors received 49 letters of objection and a petition signed by more than 850 people. The green was owned by the National Coal Board before being acquired by developers. 

Victory for residents: Following the hearing the planning board made a unanimous decision to scrap the development plans, outlined in the sketch above
