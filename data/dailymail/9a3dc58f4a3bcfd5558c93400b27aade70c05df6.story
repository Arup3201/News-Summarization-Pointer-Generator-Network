Danny Welbeck rescued Arsenal with a late equaliser on Saturday, but the Gunners lost more crucial points in the title race. Check out ADAM SHERGOLD'S player ratings from the Emirates Stadium.

ARSENAL 

Wojciech Szczesny 6

Had very little to do all afternoon as Hull had took their chances clinically. Perhaps committed to ground a little too early for the first, allowing Diame to lift the ball over him.

Hector Bellerin 6.5

Making his first Premier League start, the Spaniard did little wrong but didn’t get forward as much as he is known to do. Made a fine slide tackle to prevent Andrew Robertson storming through in first-half stoppage time.

Per Mertesacker (c) 6

Little threat to deal with for long spells of the game but was outjumped by Abel Hernandez for Hull’s second goal and should have been more alert to the threat.

Nacho Monreal 6.5

Didn’t do much wrong considering he was played out of position because of Arsenal’s debilitating defensive injury crisis. Isn’t as tall as most centre-backs but was effective in the air when Hull threatened aerially.

Kieran Gibbs 6.5

Didn’t need a second invitation to bomb forward down the left and was there in support of a number of Arsenal assaults in the first-half.

Mathieu Flamini 6

Fetched and carried between defence and midfield without doing anything spectacular. Was too lightweight as Mohamed Diame bustled up behind him to score Hull’s equaliser though Flamini did have a strong case for a foul as he was being wrestled back.

Jack Wilshere 7

Had been bright and effective throughout, collecting the ball in deep central positions and beating Hull defenders with ease. Like all Arsenal’s creative players, was perhaps guilty of playing one pass too many. Took a nasty knock to the ankle with 20 minutes left and walked straight down the tunnel - another injury worry for Arsene Wenger.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 5.5

Not really his afternoon. Took him until the second half to have a meaningful run forward and struggled to make an impression. There were more misplaced passes than normal and he tended to over-complicate, leading to Arsenal’s moves breaking down (though he wasn’t alone).

Santi Cazorla 6.5

Carried a real threat in the first-half, buzzing around right around the box and came within inches of opening the scoring with a curling shot from outside the box that Harper had to tip away at full stretch.

Alexis Sanchez 7

Dangerous, particularly during the opening exchanges when Arsenal dominated. Should have scored with a follow-up when Harper saved from Welbeck early on but did find the target with a classy step-over to beat his marker and then a precise low shot across Harper and in at the far post.

Danny Welbeck 6.5

In the right areas but snuffed out by a rigid Hull defence until right near the end. Should have scored early on after breaking clear through the middle but Harper pushed away his shot. Took his late goal very well though, to the relief of the majority inside the ground.

Substitutes

Aaron Ramsey (for Flamini 62) 7

A welcome sight for the home fans when he came on for Flamini with half-an-hour left. Helped instigate their late siege that eventually yielded a point.

Joel Campbell (for Wilshere 68) 6.5

Received a warm welcome and gave a good account of himself when he replaced the injured Wilshere. Sharp in passing and movement.

Not used: Tomas Rosicky, Mikel Arteta, Emiliano Martinez (GK), Francis Coquelin, Semi Ajayi

HULL CITY 

Steve Harper 7

Produced a hat-trick of superb saves to prevent Hull being blown away by a gale-force Arsenal start. He blocked Danny Welbeck's shot, then readjusted to block an Alexis follow-up. Also tipped over a curling effort from Santi Cazorla. Suffered an arm injury and went off at end of first-half.

James Chester 6

Shown up early on by Gibbs, who got beyond him and nearly set up a chance for Oxlade-Chamberlain. Booked for a rash tackle on Cazorla, which the Spaniard hurdled in the nick of time.

Curtis Davies (c) 6.5

Sanchez left him for dead for Arsenal’s goal but after that was a composed figure as Hull absorbed wave after wave of attack.

Michael Dawson 8

Terrific performance to keep Arsenal at bay. Made clearance after clearance and marshalled the back line as Arsenal tried to pass through it. Fine slide tackle to deny Welbeck a clear goalscoring opportunity and a chance in the first half that Szczesny caught. Limped off towards the end.

Ahmed Elmohamady 6.5

Had few opportunities to get forward himself but was able to stem Arsenal’s flow by reading the play and guessing passes and crossed. Decent display.

Tom Huddlestone 7

Tireless performance as he was pinned further and further back during the second half. Shielded the defence and they nearly held out. Some nice passing as well heading in the opposite direction, especially early on wide to Elmohamady.

Jake Livermore 6.5

Again, unable to influence things too much in attack but helped cut off some of the supply lines as Arsenal laid siege.

Mohamed Diame 7.5

Bustling and powerful, not least when he powered past three defenders (with a hint of a foul) before producing an excellent dink over Szczesny for his fourth Hull goal.

Andrew Robertson 6

Not as effective as on previous afternoons and it took a good 30 minutes for him to get a chance to run at Arsenal. Creativity slowly turned into defensive duty as the game wore on.

Hatem Ben Arfa 6

Barely noticed going forward as Arsenal kept him well and truly contained.

Late replacement for Nikica Jelavic, who pulled his hamstring in the warm-up. Saw little of the ball until he outjumped Per Mertesacker to power home a header early in the second-half.

Substitutes:

Eldin Jakupovic (for Harper 42) 7

Made a number of good saves to keep Arsenal at bay, especially to tip over a Sanchez header

Gaston Ramirez (for Hernandez 62) 6

A quiet half-hour cameo as the ball was largely down the other end.

Alex Bruce (for Dawson 84)

Not used: Liam Rosenior, Robbie Brady, Stephen Quinn
