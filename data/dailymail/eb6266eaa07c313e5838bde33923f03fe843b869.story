He was know for being a quiet man who kept himself to himself - but became the iconic face of modern technology.

So it’s only fitting that the funeral for Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died this week aged 56, took place as a small private gathering.

However a controversial church threatened it would picket the funeral because Mr Jobs ‘gave God no glory and taught sin’.

But Westboro Baptist Church ironically made the announcement on an iPhone - and later said they would only picket a public remembrance.

There are no public services planned but Apple has invited the public to send memories, thoughts and condolences to a special email address.

A source told the Wall Street Journal that the funeral was happening on Friday but would not give details of where or when it was taking place.

But Margie Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church tweeted on her iPhone that the church her father founded would be picketing the event.

The Kansas-based church has previously caused outrage by claiming God is punishing the military for America’s tolerance of gay people.

But she later wrote: ‘Keep it private, we won't come; public worship, we'll be there. Deal? #warnliving MT @WSJ: Steve Jobs funeral today; small private gathering’.

The funeral comes just two days after the former Apple CEO died on Wednesday, following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

Apple announced no cause of death, but he was diagnosed with a rare pancreatic cancer seven years ago and had a liver transplant in 2009.

It sparked an outpouring of tributes from world leaders such as President Barack Obama, business rivals including Bill Gates and other fans.

Apple would not confirm or deny the funeral reports and the source would give no further details out of respect for the family’s privacy.

Apple CEO Tim Cook told staff this week: 'We are planning a celebration of Steve’s extraordinary life for Apple employees that will take place soon.

'If you would like to share your thoughts, memories and condolences in the interim, you can simply email rememberingsteve@apple.com.’
