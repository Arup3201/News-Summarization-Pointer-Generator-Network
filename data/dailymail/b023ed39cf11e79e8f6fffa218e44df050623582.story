A man dubbed the Hypnotist Bandit by law enforcement officials in southern California has robbed three banks in the San Gabriel Valley in the past week, according to the FBI.

The suspect has earned his nickname because of the way he ‘stared at them and continued to make eye contact during the robbery.’

He struck twice on Tuesday morning, making off with an undisclosed amount of money from an HSBC Bank branch on Las Tunas Drive in Temple City and a Bank of the West branch in South El Monte, according to the FBI's news release.

He was also linked to the robbery of a Bank of the West Branch on East Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena on May 27.

In each case, the Bandit passed a note to a teller demanding cash, and in one case, threatened to use a weapon, the FBI said.

The note said ‘this is a robbery’ and asked that the teller make it ‘quick and easy,’ reports KTLA5.

The FBI has released images of the suspect taken by surveillance cameras.

He is believed to be roughly 30 years old and sports a thin frame, weighing between 190 and 200 pounds

He was described as either white or Hispanic, between 6-feet-2-inches and 6-feet-4-inches. He is believed to be roughly 30 years old and sports a thin frame, weighing between 190 and 200 pounds, according to the release.

Witnesses also told police the man has dark hair, brown eyes, a goatee and a faded red heart tattoo with a black outline on one hand.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's and Pasadena Police departments are also involved in the investigation. Anyone with information is urged to contact their nearest FBI office or dial 911.
