The gifted teenage girl who who jumped off the roof of her grandmother's 27-floor Upper West Side apartment building on Thursday made references to being bullied online and a 'petition to have her commit suicide'.

The Facebook page of Jayah Ram Jackson, 15, reveals a young girl suffocated by loneliness and depression who openly discussed the possibility of ending her own life and alluding to problems with bullies online.

On January 5, she wrote that unidentified others were urging her to commit suicide.

'At least 8 people have told me they want me to kill myself in the past 2 days,' she posted. 'I just hope that when i actually do it, they don't feel responsible. because they won't be.'

In a flurry of messages posted on Tuesday, the teen sounded dispondent about Valentines Day and how she could not bear the thought of being alone.

'I'm actually just going to wait for someone to make a petition for me to kill myself because it's inevitable,,, like, we all see it coming,' Jayah wrote on Tuesday.

Police said Jackson, 15, lept to her death at 10.40am on Thursday on Manhattan's Upper West Side.

The girl had been at her grandmother's apartment beforehand and was able to gain access to the roof because it was unlocked, police reported.

The tragic death occurred on Amsterdam Avenue off West 96th Street.

However a neighbor told the Daily News that the girl came to the building on her own.

One said: 'The doorman let her in because she visits her grandma in the building all the time. She just went up to the roof, and she jumped.'

The 15-year-old reportedly lived two blocks from the building, neighbors said.

'Rest in peace,' a friend wrote on Jayah’s Facebook page on Thursday night. 'To all the kids that disrespected you they only wanted what you had. Prayers to your family.'

Indeed, Jackson, who was a student at the prestigious NEST+m school in the Lower East Side for gifted children seems to have alluded to peer pressure in recent social media posts.

She did not leave a suicide note and had not told anyone of her depression.

Jackson's disturbed state of mind is revealed by her desperately sad Facebook post from February 11 - just two days before her suicide.

The gifted child who attends NEST+m on the Upper West Side, wrote 'I'm actually just going to wait for someone to make a petition for me to kill myself because it's inevitable...like, we all see it coming.'

And in response to her friends telling her that she was talking nonsense, Jackson replied that 'i'm just saying someone will make a petition for me to kill myself since so many people want me to.'

And the worrying specter of cyberbullying raises its head with a post that Jackson answered on social media site, Ask.FM.

When questioned on what happened with a friend, who is not being identified in print, Jackson said that the girl had attempted to bully her into taking her own life.

'(sic) idk she and others kind of ganged up on me in an attempt to get me to commit suicide or whatever.'

In other social media postings, this time on the Japanese website 'Hatena' Jackson reveals that she hurts herself because of her depression.

'It's been 6 months since I've cut my arms, and because it's been so long I have been considering suicide a lot more frequently.'

On Facebook, on February 11 she indicated the possibility that there exists a 'petition for Jayah to either get prettier, smarter, or dead.'

And two weeks earlier she had written a post in which she expressed her desire to end her own life.

'I want to kill myself so much but that's mad work and what if i dont die right away,' Jayah wrote January 12.

Jackson also admitted to issues with her appearance and weight and in a January 26 post said that she was taking medication to cope with her depression.

'I'm fearful that these meds will kick in and i'll no longer feel suicidal. I don't want that to change, okay.'

Witnesses to the tragic death recalled the terribly sound the little girl made as she landed after her fall this morning.

'I heard something that I wish I could unhear,' said a woman who identified herself only as Jen to the New York.

'It sounded like a ‘thump,’ or a ‘poof.’ I didn’t know what it was at first. It sounded like snow falling off the building.'

'Such a sweet sweet girl,' said doorman David Foster, 56. 'I never knew she had any problem.'
