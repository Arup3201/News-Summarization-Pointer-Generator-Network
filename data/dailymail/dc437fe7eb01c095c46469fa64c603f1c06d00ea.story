Sharing her secrets: Pippa Middleton's derriere captivated the country at her sister’s wedding, left, and now she is telling her readers about the routine that helped her achieve her toned behind. Right, out for a run

The 31-year-old – dubbed Her Royal Hotness ever since the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011 – has been given a monthly column in Waitrose Weekend Magazine in which to share her diet and exercise tips. 

She already writes for the supermarket’s food publication Waitrose Kitchen and now plans to share her ‘personal philosophy of healthy eating and exercise’.

She swears by four key exercises – ladders, plié squats, wall pushes and the ‘classic plank’ – that are ‘quick and great for toning all over’.

She said: ‘To get us started, I’ve chosen some of my favourite exercises for toning the whole body, all of which can be done at home. 

'Do the routine three times a week and you’ll really notice a difference.’ 

Each exercise takes around two minutes to perform, and she recommends a 30 second break between the moves with a two minute rest at the end of each circuit.

For those who are keen to emulate Miss Middleton’s famous behind, the squat and the plank will be of most interest as they are designed to strengthen and trim the gluteal muscles that make up the buttocks.

To help fire up her readers with her own self-improving zeal, Miss Middleton added: ‘I know that if I fit in at least three, ideally five, sessions of exercise a week – be it a 30minute run, an hour’s walk or a good game of tennis – it boosts my mood and energy, and helps me sleep and digest better.

‘So I make it a priority, whatever the weather or my work schedule. It’s about finding the balance that works for you, your work and your family, so good health is simple, real and achievable without being a “my body is a temple” bore.’
