A Connecticut mother and son are facing charges for stealing thousands of dollars worth of valuables from their neighbor's home on Thanksgiving night, police say.

It was just hours after the Strain family had given Laurie Eddings, 50, and her son Christopher Warren, 31, a Thanksgiving dinner that the mother and son duo burglarized the home of their, once friendly, Milford neighbors, NBC reports. 

The two family's were close, so close in fact, Crystal Strain, the victims' daughter, spent the night at the criminal's home from time to time.

That all ended when Strain entered her neighbor's home only to find Eddings and Warren rifling through her family's safe they had stolen from her family's home.

'I just dropped off a plate. I was like, 'How could you?'' Strain told NBC. 'I couldn't believe it, as much as we've done for them and helped them out.'

Court documents state that Strain said  Eddings tried to block her out of the apartment as the two went through the safe, when Strain realized what was happening, she ran across the street to her parents' home and called her mother.

Charges: Along with third-degree larceny, third-degree burglary, and conspiracy to commit both, Warren was additionally charged with third-degree criminal mischief because he was on probation at the time of the thefts

Strain said the burglars stole a house key from her and used it to unlock her family's door when they were out celebrating Thanksgiving with family. 

Strain told WFSB that she found the criminals even using her family's tools to crack open the safe.  

Police say Eddings and Warren cleared out the safe taking cash, jewelry, antique coins,  and electronics worth a total of $9,000.

Responding officers responded to Strain's call and found that this wasn't the first time the mother and son had stolen from their generous neighbors. Police uncovered a second safe that was stolen at an earlier date, according to WFSB. 

'It's unbelievable,' said Strain's father, Christopher. 'I mean, you know, you're helping them out, bringing them to the store, back and forth, doctor's visits and stuff, and then to turn around and, you know, find your stuff in their house.'

Eddings and Warren were both arrested and charged with both third-degree burglary and larceny as well as conspiracy to commit both. Warren was additionally charged with third-degree criminal mischief because he was on probation at the time, NBC reports.
