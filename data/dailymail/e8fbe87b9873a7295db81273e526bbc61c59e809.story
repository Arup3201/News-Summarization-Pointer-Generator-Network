Harriet Harman was involved in a furious exchange with Education Secretary Michael Gove after suggesting that coalition cuts were to blame for the riots.

On the BBC’s Newsnight, Labour’s deputy leader made an apparent attempt to gain political capital out of the crisis by urging ministers to ‘think again’ about their policies.

Her comments followed those by Ken Livingstone and Left-wing Labour MPs who have blamed cuts – particularly to youth services – for the violence and looting.

Clash: Harriet Harman and Michael Gove had a furious exchange of views on Newsnight on Tuesday evening, with Miss Harman accused of trying to make political gain from the riots

Miss Harman said: ‘There is a sense that young people feel  they are not being listened to. That is not to justify violence.

‘But when you’ve got the trebling of tuition fees, they should think again about that.

‘When you’ve got the EMA (Educational Maintenance Allowance paid to encourage 16-to-18-year olds to encourage them to stay in full-time education) being taken away.

When you’ve got jobs being cut and youth unemployment rising and they are shutting the jobcentre in Camberwell – well, you should think again about that because this is going to cost money. All of this does not help reduce the deficit.’

Mr Gove said it was 'ludicrous' to blame Government cuts for the riots, a point that Labour leader Ed Miliband agreed with

Should rioters have their benefits taken away from them?

And yesterday Labour leader Ed Miliband agreed, saying there was ‘no excuse for the violence and vandalism’ seen over the last few days. In a clear warning to Miss Harman and other MPs, he warned that the Labour Party would ‘not engage in simplistic explanations’ for the riots.

He told BBC Breakfast: ‘I’m not going to engage in 20-20 hindsight at the moment.’

Even the New Statesman magazine, considered the bible of the Labour Left, says it is ‘too simplistic’ to blame the cuts for the riots. In an editorial, it says: ‘If the Left is to create the intellectual space for such a debate, it must be far clearer about what those causes were.

‘The riots were not, as some have 
claimed, an uprising or insurrection against the coalition’s spending 
cuts. Many of the cuts deemed responsible for the violence have not even
taken effect. This is not to say that the cuts will not make matters 
worse.

‘Rather, it is to 
say that placing an undue and politically convenient emphasis on their 
role risks masking the social and economic deformities that lie beneath 
the violence.’
