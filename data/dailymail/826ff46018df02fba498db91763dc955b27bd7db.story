Today show correspondent Jenna Wolfe delivered some shock announcements this morning by revealing she is engaged and expecting a baby with her girlfriend Stephanie Gosk, an NBC News correspondent.

She said: 'I have some big news, I'm actually pregnant, quite pregnant. Stephanie and I are expecting a baby girl at the end of August. This is the adventure of a lifetime.'

She added: 'This is a journey that I am very excited to take.'

This is the first time Wolfe, 39, has spoken publicly about her sexuality, let alone that she has been dating her 40-year-old colleague.

The full story of the engagement and pregnancy appears in People magazine this week.

Jenna will also be blogging about her adventures throughout the final stages of her pregnancy.

In the first installment, she revealed that it was the biggest news she ever had to tell her family.

'Of all the jaw-dropping, head-turning and eye-popping things I've ever 
told my friends and family ("I swam with killer sharks", "I jet-packed 
30-feet out of the water", "I scaled the tallest building in Canada"), 
nothing garnered more shock and awe than when I 
told people I was pregnant.'

Talking about her partner, she said: 'Stephanie, a foreign correspondent here at NBC, spent years in war-torn 
countries, risking life and limb in the most dangerous places on earth 
to tell amazing stories.

'Ever since I can remember, I've been a 
thrill-seeking, dare deviling, adventure-hopping, fearless chick who 
enjoys the rush of life.

'Between the two of us, we've seen and we've 
done more than most will in a lifetime. And yet both of us agree that 
THIS little girl will be the biggest and best adventure of our lives.'

The pair have been dating for almost three years and decided they wanted a 'wide-eyed, little person' to share their adventures.

So they embarked on 'Operation Baby' 
in December, which she says was 'the best decision of her life', despite
the morning sickness.

'Last week I didn't get out to the plaza on time because I got sick right before I came outside,' she revealed.

Couple: Wolfe, left, and Gosk, right, had been dating long-distance
for a large part of their relationship but it was not until they were 
both living in the same city - and the same apartment - that they 
decided to bring up a child

Talking about coming out as gay in the People magazine interview, Wolfe said: 'This is the most exciting thing that has ever happened to us. But I don't want to bring my daughter into a world where I'm not comfortable telling everyone who I am and who her mother is.'

Gosk, who was based in London until she moved in with Wolfe in New York last fall, said: 'The beauty is that we live in a time where there's no need for secrecy. It's a very comfortable, open time. And this is a spectacular moment for us.'

The couple had been dating long-distance for a large part of their relationship but it was not until they were both living in the same city - and the same apartment - that they decided to bring up a child.

Gosk told People: 'For a long time I had feared I would never have a child. Now I can think of nothing greater than having my daughter get Jenna's spirit and energy.

'I'm excited to be a mom, but I didn't have the same level of excitement about being pregnant.'

Wolfe became pregnant through artificial insemination by an anonymous sperm donor as the couple didn't want a 'third parent'.

With the baby due in August 27, the couple have no plans to get married yet, saying: 'With everything we're doing, we haven't set a date yet.'
