'No remorse': Chantelle Hayward was jailed for 27 months for a 'vicious and unprovoked' assault on three young men in Swindon on New Year's Eve

A man smashed over the head by a woman on a drunken rampage escaped injury thanks to his Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer fancy dress.

The victim was one of three young men attacked by Chantelle Hayward, 21, at a hotel bar in Swindon, Wiltshire, on Christmas Eve last year.

In what was described as a 'vicious and unprovoked' assault, she smashed a bottle on one of them, injuring him so severely his friends had to use clothes to stem the bleeding.

She held a sharp object at the throat of a second victim, then smashed a bottle over the third - who police say was only saved from serious injury because his Rudolph costume softened the blow.

Hayward was jailed for 27 months at Swindon Crown Court today after she admitted three counts of assault including grievous bodily harm.

Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Jennifer Gray of Wiltshire Police said: 'She has shown no remorse for her actions which are likely to have left her victims with lifelong physical and mental scars.

'I hope that her jail sentence will help her victims and their families and friends come to terms with what happened on that fateful night.'

Following the court hearing the victims released statements describing the physical and emotional trauma they had suffered.

The victim who was saved by his 
reindeer costume said: 'I used to think that going out was about good 
vibes, but now I’m more negative.

'If
 I do go out I look around me and try to see who might cause trouble. I 
used to love organising music events, but what Ms Hayward did has 
completely ruined it for me.

'I now notice when venues serve drinks in glasses and glass bottles, seeing them as weapons.'

Another victim said: 'At the time Ms Hayward held a sharp object against my throat I was relieved she did not seriously injure me.

'My relief soon subsided as the after effects kicked in. I now go out less than I did and when I do go out I’m always watching my back.

'Ms Hayward knew what she had done but she did not admit to it until the very last moment. She had so much opportunity to tell the police.

'I’ve been so stressed and upset, fearing going to court. It’s just made everything worse and harder to deal with.

'She’s obviously only thought about herself and not what she has put me, my friends and my family through.'

The third victim, who suffered the most serious physical injuries, added: 'It took a matter of months for my body to recover. However, it is the emotional trauma which has affected me even more severely.

'I was due to go out for New Year with my friends. However I felt too ill and was too nervous to go anywhere - I rarely go out any more.'
