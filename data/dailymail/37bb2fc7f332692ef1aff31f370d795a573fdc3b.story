The 'mob mentality' which has blighted the Scottish independence debate has been turned off, senior Labour MP Jim Murphy claimed today as he returned to the campaign trail for this first time since being pelted with eggs.

The Labour frontbencher, addressing a crowd in Edinburgh today, accused the Yes campaign of 'co-ordinating' attacks and intimidation against those opposed to breaking up the UK. 

As the polls narrow, to give the No campaign a slender six-point lead, both sides in the debate have pleaded for calm after physical and verbal attacks on leading political figures and activists.

Mr Murphy gave a passionate defence of the union to the waiting crowds, as he warned the vote on independence is 'the most important decision we're ever going to take'

Alistair Darling, who is leading the Better Together campaign against independence, is to hold talks with police about the risk of intimidation before and on polling day.

It follows a turbulent week on the campaign trail which saw senior Mr Murphy suspend his nationwide tour amid claims of organised intimidation by Yes supporters after being pelted with eggs.

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond was also involved in a 'road rage' incident, where he was chased in his car by someone waving a No sign at him.

Today Mr Murphy returned to his pro-Union 100 Streets In 100 Days tour, claiming the 'noisy tap of mob mentality' has been turned off.

A kilted No supporter played the pipes as he mounted his Irn-Bru crates to cheers outside the Royal Scottish Academy Building off the city's Princes Street.

Mr Murphy, who was pelted with eggs as he spoke in Kirkcaldy, Fife, last week, was also greeted by a tabloid reporter dressed as a chicken and brandishing two dozen eggs.

He was heckled only once as he addressed the crowd of about 300 supporters, many sporting No Thanks badges and signs.

There was a noticeable police presence at the event, with two police cars and four officers visible.

Speaking after addressing the crowd, Mr Murphy said: 'Whoever turned on the noisy tap of that kind of mob mentality over the past fortnight has quietly turned it off over the weekend and I think that's good for the referendum, and it's great for the campaign because we can now have a really passionate debate about the future of our country.

'We can get back to talking about the pound, pensions, who's going to pay for our public services with independence.'

Mr Murphy denied he had overreacted by cancelling his tour and insisted that he had been the subject of co-ordinated attacks.

He said: 'It's clear in the past fortnight - you can see on all the social media sites - that that was co-ordinated by the Yes Scotland offices at a local level.'

He said he was looking forward to the remaining stops on his journey but refused to comment on whether the police presence would continue.

Mr Murphy added: 'Everyone on both sides of this argument should be able to passionately argue their case because this is the biggest decision we're going to take as a country.

'This is the most important decision we're ever going to take. It's irreversible. Once it's done, it's done, there's no going back and if it doesn't work out the way that nice man Mr Salmond tells us, we can't take it back to the shops.

'There's absolutely no guarantees with independence, which is why it's important to have this style of politics and make sure all our questions are answered.'

There were amicable scenes today as pro-independence campaigners clutching a Yes flag stood in front of pro-unionists who want to keep the UK together

He dismissed the suggestion that the Yes campaign has the momentum in the debate, with a new poll showing support for Scottish independence has risen eight points in a month

Mr Murphy said: 'The No campaign is in the lead and if you ask me which campaign I'd rather be with - the No or the Yes campaign - then I'd rather be with the leading campaign, the patriotic No campaign.

'The thing that worries me isn't the opinion polls, it's the fact that with a fortnight to go we still don't know what currency Scotland would use if we're independent. Those are real worries.' 

Election officials say they are braced for a huge turnout on September 18, and plans are being drawn up to cope with large crowds and the threat of trouble at some polling stations.

Mr Murphy accused Yes Scotland of 'organising for mobs to turn up at each meeting to try and intimidate me, which won't work, and to try and silence undecided voters'

Mr Darling said yesterday: 'In a campaign such as this, we need to ensure the debate is conducted in a reasonable way.

'The eyes of the world are on Scotland for the next two and a half weeks.

'Intimidation, whether it is on the internet or on the street, or making people afraid to say what they think, it's got no place in any democratic society and we should have absolutely zero tolerance of it.'

He added: 'I want this to be a debate that is argued with passion, there are passions on both sides of the argument, quite rightly so.

'But it has to be argued in a way that is reasonable. Then we will decide on September 18 in which way the future of Scotland lies.'

The former chancellor spoke out on the issue as he launched a new Better Together poster campaign in Greenock, Inverclyde.

'We've had discussions with the police, I think they are very conscious that people have got to be allowed to have their say, but there is a mark over which you should not step,' he added.

'I don't care where it comes from, which side it's from, it has got no place in the referendum debate.'

Better Together leader Alistair Darling and his opponent, First Minister Alex Salmond, have both issued public pleas for calm and an end to threats

The Yes campaign is now just six points behind in the battle for independence, suggesting Alex Salmond has the momentum

Mr Salmond also condemned any intimidation from any side. The First Minister said: 'Somebody was convicted, of course, of online threats against me. Somebody thought his car should be a political weapon. There was a woman, a Yes campaigner, assaulted on the streets of Glasgow.

'I don't hold press conferences accusing Mr Murphy of orchestrating these events, because I know that would be ridiculous to do so.'

Mary Pitcaithly, the Chief Counting Officer overseeing the referendum, has discussed security with Police Scotland, given the prospect of a high turnout for the vote.

Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins told the Herald newspaper: 'The referendum is a significant event which is expected to attract a higher than normal turnout.

'Policing arrangements for the referendum are well in hand and will be appropriate and proportionate.'
