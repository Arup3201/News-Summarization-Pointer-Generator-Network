A former DEA agent is spilling the details of his missions as an undercover cartel boss and drug trafficker - and warns that the drug cartels may never be stopped on either side of the border.

Celerino Castillo III, an American-born Vietnam veteran and former DEA agent, spoke out in a recent interview about his involvement in the 1980s-era war on drugs.

After several years as a police detective, Castillo became a DEA agent in 1979, and was sent to the jungles of Peru, where he operated search and destroy missions.

He was later forced out of the country after a hit was put out on him.

Speaking out: Celerino Castillo III operated in search and destroy missions in Peru, Guatemala and El Salvador in the 1980s

Going undercover: Castillo worked with other DEA agents and informants to infiltrate the drug cartels

But instead of returning to the U.S., he
reported to El Salvador and Guatemala, where he aided anti-narcoterrism
units, undercover operations, run raids and search-and-destroy 
missions.

Castillo told Vice: 'I played different parts, I played being a Mexican, drug trafficker buying large quanities of cocaine. We were infiltrating drug cartels with informants. Introduced to different members of the cartels. At that time period, you actually knew who they were.'

When he worked with authorities in Mexico, Castillo was struck by their use of excessive force.

He told Vice that Mexican authorities would hang suspects upside down and splash water above their noses, creating a waterboarding-like effect. He said they also used cattle prods.

Agent: Sometimes Castillo posed as a drug trafficker, often handling bales of cocaine

He said: 'Mexican authorities were known to do the most outrageous things you could think of. [It was] my first case of torturing people.

'I couldn’t understand it, but they said, "This is what we do in Mexico and this is what we’ll continue to do... You guys aren't going to come in here and tell us how to do it."'

Today, Castillo says the cartels remain a juggernaut on the U.S.-Mexico border - and believes that they'll remain as long as their wallets stay fat.

War on drugs: Castillo says that the cartels remain a juggernaut on the U.S.-Mexico border - and believes that they'll remain as long as their wallets stay fat

He told Vice: I don't think drug trafficking will ever stop. It’s become too big of a monster. We've created a beast and it’s going to be very difficult. The cartels have controlled both sides of the border because they have the money to do it.

On Tuesday, Border Patrol agent Nicholas Ivie became the latest casualty of the war on drugs when he was shot to death in Arizona, the first fatal shooting of an agent since 2010.

Victim: Border patrol agent Nicolas Ivie, 30, was identified as the agent who was killed during the shootout early Tuesday morning

Ivie, 30, and a colleague were on patrol in the desert near Naco, Arizona, about 100 miles from Tucson, when shooting broke out shortly before 2am, the Border Patrol said.

The second agent was shot in the ankle and buttocks, and was airlifted to a hospital.

Authorities have not identified the agent who was wounded, nor did they say whether any weapons were seized at the site of the shooting.

Mr Ivie is survived by a wife and two children.

No arrests have been made in the shooting.

Investigators suspect that more that just one person fired at the agents.

'It was basically an ambush,' said Cochise County Sheriff's Office commander Marc Denney.

'They had a little bit of a jump on 
us. It is very rocky terrain. We're hoping that they hunkered down 
somewhere close by so that we have an opportunity to find them.'

The sheriff's office, the DEA and the FBI, which are both investigating the 
shooting, declined to say whether investigators have recovered guns or 
bullet casings at the scene of the shooting.

Authorities set up a checkpoint on a 
dirt road about seven miles southeast of Bisbee.

The Tuscon Sentinel
cites a reporter from Fronteras Desk who claimed that two suspects have
been detained in Mexico though their identities were not been released.

Searching: Agents continued to search for clues and the suspects well into Tuesday after the early morning shooting

Coordination: Agents from multiple government agencies are working together on the search, and the area of the shooting is used frequently by drug traffickers

The
area near the shooting is scattered with houses, trailers and 
ranchettes. Mesquite trees and creosote bushes dotted the landscape, and
a mountain range stands nearby to the west.

The U.S. government has put thousands 
of sensors along the border that, when tripped, alert dispatchers that 
they should send agents to a particular location.

'It’s a very rough area — it’s 
mountainous, rocky, loose rock, low vegetation,' Cochise county 
sheriff's commander Marc Denney told The Los Angeles Times.

'It’s
hard terrain to maneuver around. There’s not a lot of trail systems in 
place. You’re just trying to work your way around and not turn an 
ankle.'

Reeling: This is the first fatal shooting of a border patrol agent since 2010, as the only other deaths have due to car accidents

The
agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of
the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of 
the sensors, said sheriff's spokeswoman Carol Capas.

It is not known whether the agents returned fire, Capas said.

The wounded agent is in stable 
condition and should be released from the hospital later Tuesday, said 
George McCubbin, president of the National Border Patrol Council, a 
union representing about 17,000 border patrol agents.

The agents who 
were shot were on patrol with a third agent, who was not harmed, 
Mr McCubbin said.

The Border Patrol said Ivie worked for the agency since January 2008 and grew up in Provo, Utah.

Warning: The agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of the sensors installed to alert possible breaches

The last Border Patrol agent fatally 
shot on duty was Brian Terry, who died in a shootout with bandits near 
the border in December 2010.

The Border Patrol station in Naco, where 
the two agents shot Tuesday were stationed, was recently named after 
Terry.

Terry's shooting was 
later linked to the government's Fast and Furious gun-smuggling 
operation, which allowed people suspected of illegally buying guns for 
others to walk away from gun shops with weapons, rather than be 
arrested.

Prior to Tuesday's attack, the most recent fatality was Leopoldo Cavazos Jr. who died on July 6 due to injuries from an ATV accident near Fort Hancock, Texas.James Dominguez was killed on July 19 when he was killed by a passing vehicle while helping stranded motorists in Cline, Texas.Both Hector Clark and his partner agent Eduardo Rojas Jr. were killed when their patrol car was hit by a freight train near Gila Bend, Arizona.The case that has drawn the most publicity in recent years was that of agent Brian Terry,
whose shooting death on December 15, 2010, during a sting operation 
shed light on the government's 'Fast and Furious' plan to track gun 
trafficking between the U.S.-Mexico border.

Authorities intended to track the guns into Mexico. Two rifles found at the scene of Terry's shooting were bought by a member of the gun-smuggling ring being investigated.

Critics of the operation say any shooting along the border now will raise the specter those illegal weapons are still being used in border violence.

'There's no way to know at this point how the agent was killed, but because of Operation Fast and Furious, we'll wonder for years if the guns used in any killing along the border were part of an ill-advised gun-walking strategy,' Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said in a written statement.

The Terry family said that the 
shooting was a 'graphic reminder of the inherent dangers that threaten 
the safety of those who live and work near the border.'

Twenty-six Border Patrol agents have died in the line of duty since 2002.

Bisbee-area
residents expressed a mix of concern and frustration about the 
shooting, along with recognition that the border can be a dangerous 
place.

The region has seen 
its share of violence in recent years, including the Terry shooting and 
the slaying of a well-known rancher in 2010.

That killing is, in part, 
credited with pushing Arizona lawmakers to pass a law that requires 
officers, when they stop someone, to check the immigration status of 
those they suspect are in the country illegally.

'There is no security on the border - none,' said Edward L. Thomas, who owns rental properties in Bisbee.
