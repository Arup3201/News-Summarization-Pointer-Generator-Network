Lucie Blackman's family today said they still do not know how she died, 13 years after her body was found in Japan

The family of Lucie Blackman said today they still do not know how she died 13 years after she was killed in Tokyo by a millionaire Japanese property developer.

Lucie was 21 when she disappeared in the Japanese capital where she had been working as a bar hostess in 2000.

Her dismembered body was discovered buried in a seaside cave near an apartment owned by Joji Obara, 61, who could not be charged with murder as Lucie’s body was so badly decomposed.

He was cleared of manslaughter due to a
 lack of evidence but later found guilty of her abduction, dismemberment
 and the disposing of her body in 2008 after the Blackman family 
appealed.

An inquest at Croydon Coroner’s Court today recorded an open verdict into her death.

After the hearing Lucie’s father Tim, 60,
 said: 'I really hoped they could have gone through it all and came up 
with some suggestion of how Lucie died.'

Obara is now serving life imprisonment 
for what happened to Lucie, as well as the rape and murder of Australian
 nightclub hostess Carita Ridgway, who died in Tokyo in 1992, and a 
string of rapes on other women.

Mr Blackman added he felt ‘let down’ by the Japanese court system, where verdicts are determined by three judges rather than a jury.

He
 said: 'It is simply not geared up to deal with a case and trial of the 
nature of Lucie’s. They depend so heavily on confessionals over there.

'I
 can’t imagine if it had been in a British court and such evidence had 
been presented to a jury of 12 people they would have originally 
directed there was no case to answer.

'The Japanese police were very slow and needed a push to get going but it is the court system that let us down really.'

Japanese police believe Obara, who filmed sex attacks on his drugged victims, could be responsible for up to 900 rapes.

Lucie's sister Sophie, who was 19 when she died, said today’s verdict made no difference as ‘Lucie’s still gone.’

She said: 'Today is just a formality for us, the last thing. It’s over in a way, but it will never be closure for us. We still have to live with what happened.

'I think Lucie’s death just reinforces how tragic it is that a 21-year-old girl can go on holiday with her best friend and end up murdered and here we are 13 years later in a dingy coroners court.

'The value of life is so important but it’s family and friends that are left behind who end up living with the sadness of it all.

“If it wasn’t for Lucie, a man who had 900 videos of him raping women and killed an Australian girl could still be out there.

'Lucie’s death brought those cases into the public domain and put this serial rapist in prison for the rest of his life.'

Recalling the last time she saw her older sister, Sophie, now 33, said: 'It was the night before she flew to Japan. I remember that night I slept with her in her bed.

'It was such a long time ago. But life goes on, we have to move forward and just cope with things as best we can.'

She said the hardest times were family occasions, Christmas and Lucie’s birthday. On September 1 this year she would have turned 35.

Her dad Tim added: 'The thing I find hardest is the life we would have had with Lucie.

'Many of her friends are now married and have children. Having her future taken away from us and not being able to share it with her is what is most difficult to deal with.'

Earlier the inquest heard several post mortems were performed in Japan and the UK which revealed traces of sedatives and the ‘date-rape’ drug Rohypnol were found in her body.

An unidentified black substance was also found in her mouth.

Coroner Dr Roy Palmer said: 'It’s been an awful long time I know. I think it is the longest case that I can think of without being concluded. Even now we don’t have all the answers we’d like.'

Croydon Coroners' Court coroner Dr Roy Palmer recorded an open verdict and admitted the family were not given 'answers that would in any way satisfy you'

He told Lucie’s family: 'I’m so very, very sorry you lost Lucie in such sad circumstances and that no one’s been able to give the answers that would in any way satisfy you.'

The inquest heard former British Airways air hostess Lucie had only been in Japan with her friend Louise Phillips, also 21, two months before she went missing on July 1, 2000.

That night she had been working at the Casablanca hostess club and is believed to have gone back to Obara’s apartment.

When she failed to return the next day her friend reported her missing. Lucie’s parents made several visits to Japan and spent thousands of pounds trying to find her.

But her remains were found on a beach 60miles from Tokyo, near Obara’s apartment, in February 2001. She was identified by DNA but the coroner said without a cause of death he must record an open verdict.

Lucie’s family have since set up the Lucie Blackman Trust to help other families cope with the deaths of their relatives abroad and provide assistance to them.
