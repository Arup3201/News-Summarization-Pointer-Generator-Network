Jean-Claude Juncker launched a bizarre defence of the Luxembourg tax-dodging scandal yesterday, insisting he was not to blame despite having been its prime minister for 18 years.

The scandal engulfing the new European Commission President and arch-federalist deepened after a disastrous press conference in which he attempted to claim it was not his fault. Mr Juncker told journalists that he was ‘not the architect of what you could call the Luxembourgish problem’.

‘There is nothing in my past indicating that my ambition was to organise tax evasion in Europe,’ he added. 

Can't hear your over all my avoidance: Jean-Claude Juncker claims there is no conflict of interest as the European Commission begins to investigate tax deals between international corporations and Luxembourg, deals which were made while he was prime minister

But Mr Juncker was either prime minister or finance minister of the country for more than two decades from the mid-90s.

Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘I would be surprised if he was in charge of the country and didn’t know what was going on. I don’t know what’s worse – being in charge and turning a blind eye to aggressive tax avoidance or being in charge and not knowing what’s going on. You wouldn’t want to have someone in charge of the EU who didn’t know what’s going on. He has got some very serious questions to answer.’ 

It was reported last week that Luxembourg had granted secret deals to 340 companies allowing them to avoid tax. It helped them avoid paying billions in tax elsewhere and was agreed at the time when Mr Juncker was in charge of the country.

He said yesterday it was up to the Luxembourg government to explain its behaviour. Bizarrely, he also appeared to blame the problems in Luxembourg on Britain and other countries in Europe blocking tax harmonisation across the continent.

He suggested that tax rates that ‘can sometimes lack fairness’, a problem caused by countries such as the UK not wanting to give up sovereignty over taxation. ‘If there is insufficient tax harmonisation in Europe then this can be the result,’ he said.

Mr Juncker admitted that as prime minister he was ‘politically responsible’ for what happened in each and every corner of the country’, but indicated he did not know the tax deals were being negotiated.

Companies such as Burberry and Dyson had their divisions in Luxembourg lend money to their operations in other countries. 

The interest payments made on these loans reduced the profits in these countries. In some cases it was claimed companies enjoyed tax rates of less than 1 per cent on profits moved into the Grand Duchy.

Reports about the tax breaks surfaced last week, putting Juncker, who only took office on November 1, immediately in the firing line given the European Union's headline commitment to fighting tax fraud.

Tory MP Stewart Jackson called for Mr Juncker to resign.

He said: ‘His position is untenable. The issue of corporate tax avoidance has been high on the UK agenda because of Amazon, Google and Starbucks. The sweet heart deals of countries such as Luxembourg sit at odds with a Commission President who says that he supports widespread economic and financial reform.’

Patrick O’Flynn, Ukip’s economics spokesman, said: ‘The EU actually facilitates tax avoidance by enabling multinational corporations to channel earnings through whichever member state they want.

‘Luxembourg was happy to do dirty dealings with the big corporations to maximise its revenues at the cost of tens of billions of pounds that should have ended up in the UK public realm.

‘Juncker has lots of questions to answer. It’s why multinationals are so keen on EU membership but why it is not in the UK’s interest.’

Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said Mr Juncker had ‘presided over the biggest exploitation of European nations in his own little country for decades’.

The Labour MP, who has been one of the fiercest critics of tax avoidance by companies such as Starbucks, Google and Amazon, said: ‘I think he should come clean and talk about it, certainly try to explain it. How can we know he’s working in the interest of Europe when as prime minister in Luxembourg he has exploited populations in every European country and elsewhere for decades?’

The Commission has launched a series of investigations into tax arrangements in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg on the grounds they might infringe state aid rules by unfairly favouring some companies over others. 

EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has promised to press on with the probes and Juncker earlier said he would let the process take its course, as it should.

However, questions about his role in deals which are technically legal but go against the grain at a time of austerity, refuse to go away.

On Wednesday, Juncker turned up at the Commission's midday press conference unannounced, only for journalists to question his credibility and suitability as head of the EU's key executive arm.

'I'm as suitable as you are,' Juncker replied to one journalist.

Juncker said that as head of the Commission he could no longer comment on Luxembourg's affairs.

Some 22 of the 28 EU states had similar tax arrangements, he said, and the issue was to ensure that they did not violate state aid rules.
