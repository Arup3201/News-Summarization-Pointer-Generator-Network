Chelsea winger Victor Moses has joined Stoke City on a season-long loan deal as Jose Mourinho trims his squad ahead of the new season.

Moses looked set to be part of the Portuguese boss' squad due to his homegrown status - but instead he will play under Mark Hughes at the Britannia Stadium.

The Nigerian spent last season on loan at Liverpool but struggled for game time in Brendan Rodgers' title-chasing side.

Stoke Chief Executive Tony Scholes said: 'We are delighted to have secured the services of such an exciting young talent in Victor.

'He will certainly add to our attacking options and from talking to him it's obvious that he's really excited about the prospect of making an impact in the Premier League with Stoke City.'Â 

Mourinho brought Moses on as a substitute during Chelsea's pre season win over Hungarian outfit Ferencvaros but he was an unused substitute in their next game against Real Sociedad.

The Chelsea manager admitted he was considering keeping hold of Moses earlier this week but the winger is thought to want first team football, which he is unlikely to get at Stamford Bridge with competition from the likes of Eden Hazard, Willian and Andre Schurrle.

Moses is not available for Stoke's season opener against Aston Villa but could make his Potters debut against Hull next weekend. He will wear the No 13 shirt.
