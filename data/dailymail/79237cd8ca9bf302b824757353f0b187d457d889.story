A One Direction fan reportedly killed her pet Chihuahua in a fit of rage because the British boy band did not respond to requests to follow her on Twitter.

The woman sent a desperate tweet to the five singers from her @illumivato account two weeks ago saying: 'Follow me or I'll break my dog's neck'.

The post was accompanied by a picture showing someone pinning a dog to the ground by its throat.

But with millions of tweets being sent to their account everyday, the group very likely did not spot the message and it went ignored.

Several days later, she wrote directly to band member Liam Payne on the social networking site to say: 'I love you. Follow me. My dog has just died.'

She added a picture that she claimed showed her crying as she cradled a dead dog, it was reported by the New York Daily News.

It was all later revealed to be a sick hoax.

MailOnline discovered the picture of the girl with the dead dog was first posted onto the internet in June - two months before she claims to have threatened to kill it:

Each comes with similar messages threatening to kill them if the boy band didn't follow her on Twitter.

Fans of the band, known as 
'Directioners', branded her a 'psycho', with one setting up a petition 
on Change.org demanding she be imprisoned which now has around 3,000 signatures.

Mya Fhya, who set up the petition, said: 'This person needs to burn in hell and I want to see justice.'

The
 case has been widely reported by the Spanish and South American media, 
but the woman's name and location have not been revealed.

One Direction has not yet commented on the incident.
