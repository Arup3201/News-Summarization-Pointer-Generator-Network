Eugenie Bouchard's quest to match her stellar 2014 record in Grand Slam tournaments started on a positive note when she beat Anna-Lena Friedsam of Germany 6-2, 6-4 in the first round of the Australian Open.

Bouchard, who reached the semi-finals at three majors last year and lost in the Wimbledon final, broke Friedsam's serve in the ninth game of the second set and held serve in the next to clinch the match when the German player hit a forehand wide.

At the All England Club last year, Bouchard became the first Canadian, male or female, to reach a Grand Slam final.
