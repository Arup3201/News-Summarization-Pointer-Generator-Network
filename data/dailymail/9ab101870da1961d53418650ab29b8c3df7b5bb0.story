Chelsea are confident they can beat Tottenham on Wednesday, even without star striker Diego Costa.

Costa, who has scored 11 times already in the league this season since joining Chelsea from Atletico Madrid, is suspended for the game after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season in Saturday's goalless draw with Sunderland.

But midfielder Nemanja Matic insists that his side have the quality to break down Spurs without the Spain international.

'I'm not scared,' Matic told reporters. 'Of course we need to have everybody available but in Didier Drogba and Loic Remy, we have good strikers.'

Matic admitted that, after Sunderland's resilient display this weekend, Chelsea need to find a new way to break down stubborn opponents. 

'Now every team is going to try to defend like that against us,' he said. 'We know that and we're ready for that. But we will find the space to score.

Costa has been prolific for Chelsea so far this season, scoring 11 times in the league since joining the club

'We knew they would create problems for us and we were ready for that.

'We didn't play badly. They played well even though I felt comfortable on the pitch and for 90 minutes we controlled the game.

'But they were compact and had 10 players on the edge of the box all the time, it was difficult to find space out there.

'We are not happy with one point but it is better than to go home with zero. If you don't score, you cannot win but [against Tottenham] we cannot let this happen again, we have to score.'
