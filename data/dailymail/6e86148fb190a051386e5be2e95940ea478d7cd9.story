Poor you: Hatre cleric Abu Hamza's wife, Najat, has complained the extremist hasn't been able to use a comb in his American jail cell, where he awaits trial for 11 terror-related offences

The wife of hate preacher Abu Hamza has hit out at American prison authorities because they won't let her husband comb his hair.

Muslim extremist Hamza was finally extradited from Britain last year and is in America awaiting trial on 11 terror-related offences.

Wife Najat, who was discovered living on benefits with some of her seven children in Hammersmith, west London, last year, bleated on a website for Hamza's supporters over his treatment in his New York jail, where he is kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.

She writes: 'Since he’s been there his hair has not been combed due to a comb not being available for him.'

According to the Sunday Express, she also moans at how he hasn't had any face-to-face meetings since his incarceration.

Even when he meets lawyers, he cannot see them because they sit behind a glass screen with a curtain, she says.

She writes: 'All this time he has remained in solitary confinement 23 hours a day in a small room with no window and no sunlight.

'For one hour, he is allowed to stretch his legs just next to his cell where there is not even enough room to even do that.

'He doesn’t even know the direction of the kibla (which indicates the direction in which Muslims must pray).'

She says she has received few letters from him and he has been allowed to call her just once.

Najat, who thanks 'all those brothers and sisters who have supported my husband for all these years', adds the cleric is still praying but is left to guess.

Finally: Abu Hamza was extradited last year after a concerted campaign to have him gone. Here builders call for the hook-handed cleric to be deported back in 2004

It has also been reported he is seldom allowed the use of his hook.

She adds to his fans: 'Your help, love and concern for him has not gone unnoticed. Your reward is with Allah.'

Hamza gained global notoriety for his fanatical sermons outside London’s Finsbury Park mosque after the 9/11 terror attack on New York. He was jailed on terrorism-related charges at high-security Belmarsh Prison in London.

In the US he has denied facilitating violent jihad in Afghanistan and trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Oregon.

He has also denied involvement in the 1998 kidnapping of Western tourists in Yemen, in which three Britons and an Australian died.

Hamza, 54, was finally extradited to New York last October and is awaiting trial on 11 terrorism-related offences. It took Britain eight  years to get rid of him as he fought extradition to the US.

The legal and prison bills cost taxpayers at least £1million.
