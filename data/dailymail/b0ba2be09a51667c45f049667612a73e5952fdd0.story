Far-flung family members, co-workers and friends frantically used social media, cellphones and even a Google 'people finder' website to try to learn the fate of participants and spectators at the Boston Marathon.

The
 search was made more difficult because heavy cellphone use caused slow 
and delayed service. In an age connected by everything digital, the 
hours after the blasts produced a tense silence.

Google
stepped in to help find loved 
ones, setting up a site called Google Person Finder.

The site allows users to
 enter the name of a person they're looking for or update information 
about someone who was there.

Google's person finder was invaluable for those trying to find their loved ones in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing

A few hours after the explosion, the site 
indicated it was tracking 5,100 records.

At
 the race, 51-year-old Julie Jeske, of Bismarck, N.D., had finished 
about 15 minutes before the explosions and was about two blocks away 
when she heard two loud booms.

She immediately tried to call her parents
 but could not place the call. A friend was able to post on Facebook 
that they were OK, but reaching her parents was another worry.

'I
 wasn't able to call and I felt so bad,' Jeske said. 'When I was finally
 able to reach them, my mom said she was just absolutely beside herself 
with fear.'

On the other side of the continent, in Seattle, Lisa Cliggett was waiting for any word from her brother and sister-in-law.

Mark
 Cliggett, 51, and his wife, Dr. Janet Vogelzang, 54, have run several 
marathons together and always send their sons text messages after 
crossing the finishing line.

On Monday, those messages didn't arrive and
 the couple could not be reached via cellphone.

Lisa
 Cliggett said she went to the marathon's website and tried to calculate
 where the couple should be based on their last locations and running 
speeds.

She decided they should have already finished the race when the 
blasts hit.

'The question is, do you loiter around the finish line?' she said. 'And where was the bomb?'

Finally,
 about three hours after the blasts, the couple called their sons to 
tell they were unhurt. Matt Cliggett sent his sister a text that said, 'We were about 100 yards from second explosion. Sad day.'

As terror and confusion reigned in Boston, people turned to social media to reach their friends and family

Mary 
Beth Aasen, of Shorewood, Wis., and her husband were using an app to 
track their daughter Maggie's progress along the marathon route.

They 
didn't realize anything was wrong until a worried friend texted Aasen 
and asked if Maggie was OK.

The app indicated 
that Maggie was still moving, a relief for her parents. Mary Beth Aasen 
tried in vain to call her daughter for about 30 minutes before Maggie 
called her.

'When I talked to her she was pretty upset,' Aasen said.

Kim
 Hauser, a substitute teacher in the Chicago area, did not know about 
the explosions until her students went home and she got a chance to look
 at her phone.

There were messages from acquaintances asking, 'Is your 
brother OK?' She searched the news and it dawned on her why they were 
asking.

Heavy cell phone use following the bombing made it incredibly difficult to reach people

'I tried to call him immediately, but 
there was no cell service,' the Frankfort, Ill., woman said.  'I waited 
anxiously by the phone. I just felt horrible. I had a hard time holding 
myself together.'

Five minutes became 10, then
 20 - finally, 45 minutes later she looked down to see a text from her 
brother, Thomas Wiora.

He had crossed the finish line shortly before the
 explosion and was 120 yards away when it went off. But he was fine.

'I was relieved,' she said. 'But the whole thing was so heartbreaking.'

Mary
 Butler, of Oklahoma City, hadn't been able to reach her husband, Jason,
 who was running with his son, brother and other family members.

But she
 said he'd posted on Facebook that he and the others were OK.

'That's
 all I know about it,' Mary Butler said, adding she'd been trying to 
call since she'd first heard of the explosions. 'I'm just waiting - keep
 trying to call.'

She declined to talk further so that she could keep her phone line open.

Cellphone networks were unable to handle the huge demand for service

Google set up a site which allows users to update information on runners and spectators which anyone can access

Apps which tracked runners' movements - and showed if they were still moving - also brought relief to loved ones
