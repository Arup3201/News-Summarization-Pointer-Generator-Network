Speakers at the National Rifle Association's annual convention took pot shots at President Barack Obama, as the man who has become the face of America's largest gun-rights group announced that the NRA had grown to 5 million members.

'By the time we're finished, that must and will be 10 million,' said NRA executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre.

But much of Saturday's activities at the group's annual convention were devoted to slamming Obama for what speakers called failed gun control legislation for which the White House has manufactured the illusion of popular support.

NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre slammed President Obama for ignoring the gun violence problem caused firearms in his native Chicago owned by criminals. He also announced that his organization had for the first time enrolled five million members

National Rifle Association President David Keene said Americans' support for a gun-control Senate bill soured once they learned what was in the proposed law. The legislation ultimately failed despite White House claims of overwhelming public support

The White House has claimed that a massive majority of Americans supported the measure, which would have expanded the use of background checks before gun purchases.

Obama endorsed the bill, but it failed in an April Senate vote. And many Republicans in Washington have declared the gun-control season closed.

'Support for the president's agenda began to weaken,' NRA president David Keene claimed Saturday, 'as ordinary citizens began to look deeper at what was proposed.'

LaPierre was less diplomatic, calling the bill, co-sponsored n the Senate by West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin and Pennsylvania Republican Patrick Toomey a 'convoluted scheme tantamount to national registration of every gun owner in America.'

Claiming Obama harbors an 'agenda to destroy our Second Amendment,' he insisted that the president 'will stop at nothing. Then he boasted, 'That's what he has gotten: nothing. Absolutely nothing.'

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One that as many as 23 'executive actions' were under consideration, which could allow Obama to act without Congress

Texas Gov. Rick Perry seemed to agree about Obama in a Washington Times interview published Saturday.

'His goal - well before he became president of the United States - was to try to disarm the American public,' Perry said. 'He just disregards the Constitution.'

LaPierre also blamed the White House for misleading Americans about the content of the failed Senate bill. But 'the biggest whopper of all,' he insisted, 'is that 90 per cent of Americans support his background check bill.

During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One on Friday, while en route from Mexico to Costa Rica, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that Obama remains committed to 'pressing Congress to take action to reduce gun violence.'

And that, Carney said, 'includes exploring every executive action he might be able to 
take' without congressional approval.

NRA lobbying chief Chris Cox said gun control groups have 'spent millions on bogus polls' - which the White House then leverages politically - to create an impression that Americans are clamoring for firearms restrictions

Obama's 'goal, well before he became president of the United States, was to try to disarm the American public,' said Texas Gov. Rick Perry

'We are going to
 press ahead,' Carney added. 'The President made clear that sometimes these efforts 
don’t succeed initially, but especially when you have 85 to 90 per cent 
of the American people supporting, in the case of background checks 
being expanded, a legislative proposal, this is going to get done.

That statistic comes from a Quinnipiac University poll conducted between March 27 and April 1. It found that mandatory background checks for most gun purchasers have 91 per cent of U.S. voters, including 96 per cent of Democrats, 88 per cent of Republicans and 88 per cent of Americans in gun-owning households.

In the same poll, 53 per cent of gun owners - the constituency gathered in Houston - agreed that 'universal background checks could lead to confiscation of legal guns.'

Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, the group's lobbying arm, questioned the White House's number - saying that gun control groups have 'spent millions on bogus polls.'

Actor and former Marine Corps drill instructor Ronald Lee 'Gunny' Ermey, best known for his gunnery-sergeant role in Full Metal Jacket, told MailOnline at the NRA convention that President Obama 'doesn't know who he's fooling with'

NRA members aren't a shy bunch, and many wore t-shirts expressing their love for firearms - or their disdain for gun control advocates like CNN host Piers Morgan

LaPierre said 'the only "90" the president won't talk about is Chicago - his own hometown, now run by his former chief of staff. The president won't talk about Chicago, but he should. Because in the entire United States, Chicago rates 90th out of 90 jurisdictions in federal firearms prosecution: dead last.'

He added that there is 'a shooting every 6.3 hours' in the Windy City, 'the deadliest city in America, the president's own home town.'

'If the president had one clue about how to clean up violent crime,' LaPierre said to applause, 'don't you think he'd do it in his own hometown? If his policies brought us Chicago, why would we want to listen to him on anything else?'
