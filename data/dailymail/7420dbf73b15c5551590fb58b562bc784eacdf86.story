More than one in every ten bank notes in circulation is tainted with cocaine powder.

Police say growing use of the drug means the number of notes carrying traces of the Class A drug has trebled in six years.

Worryingly, specialist drugs officers say cocaine taken in combination with alcohol is fuelling violence on Britain’s streets.

Tainted: Drugs specialists say users were taking cocaine so they could continue drinking into the early hours

Yesterday, one warned Labour’s 24-hour drinking laws had sparked a rise in cocaine use - as it was taken by drinkers who want to stay out all night.  

Details of the growing prevalence of cocaine were given to a meeting of the Government’s official drugs body yesterday.

Police constable Adrian Parsons, Kent Police’s drug expert evidence coordinator told the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs that users were taking ‘coke’ so they could carry on drinking into the early hours.

The 2003 Licensing Act abolished traditional closing time, allowing pubs to stay open routinely after 11pm.

He said: ‘It’s my personal view that the change in licensing laws led to a rise in the use of cocaine.

‘We have got extended licensing hours, we have got people who are not ramming as much down their necks as before 11 and who are going all night.’

He added: ‘Cocaine is everywhere, it’s a drug that we see all over the place.’ 

Kent constabulary, along with 10 other forces in England and Wales, routinely test bank notes seized during raids to test for levels of drugs.  

Up to 70 per cent of notes taken from suspected drug dealers have cocaine traces on them.

But the programme has also tested around 5,000 ordinary notes and has found startling rises in positive cocaine tests in recent years.

Six years ago around four per cent of notes showed cocaine residue from a simple swab test.

But the most recent figures show that has nearly trebled to 11 per cent.

Recent tests have also shown rising evidence cocaine is being mixed with MDMA - the active ingredient in the dance drug ecstasy.

Often cocaine is mixed with MDMA and users are unaware they are taking a drug cocktail.

Notes are often rolled up by users to ‘snort’ lines of the drug. 

PC Parsons pointed to figures from Liverpool John Moores university that showed before the Licensing Act - which came into force in 2005 - most cocaine users said they took the drug for ‘confidence in social situations’. 

But recently the same study - of 17-29 year-olds - has shown the reason given most often was so they could ‘keep going and stay awake’.

Around one in 11 adults in England and Wales admit having ever taken cocaine.

Figures from the British Crime Survey show that in 2003/4 around 5.4 per cent admitting taking the drug in the previous year.

By 2008/9 that peaked at 6.6 per cent -  an increase of nearly a fifth.

PC Parsons said cocaine and alcohol in combination led to users having an ‘air of invincibility’, and made them more likely to be aggressive towards the police.

Separate evidence presented to the committee showed cocaine use was highest among higher earners.

Surveys show it peaks among individuals earning £40,000 or higher. Rates were lower among those on middle incomes but was also high among those with salaries of less than £10,000.

Users in England were most likely to be aged between 20 and 24.

Drug experts warn cocaine, which is highly addictive, can lead to heart attacks, strokes and brain seizures.

Persistent use can also damage the liver, and lead to paranoia, anxiety and depression.

The price of cocaine has plummeted in recent years. Figures from Drugscope show cocaine cost £70 a gram in 2003 but now costs as little as £40 a gram. Depending on purity, that amount will provide ten or 20 lines.
