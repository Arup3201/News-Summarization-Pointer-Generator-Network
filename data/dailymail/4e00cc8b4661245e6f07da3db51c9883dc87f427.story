An image of a middle-aged cross-dresser is the first painting of its kind to be hung in the revered National Portrait Gallery.

Painted in 1792 by Thomas Stewart it depicts Chevalier d’Eon, an eighteenth-century diplomat and celebrated British transvestite.

French born d'Eton lived in London from 1762-1777 as a man, and from 1785-1810 as a woman.

'The patron saint of transvestites': Painted in 1792, the portrait depicts Britain¿s first celebrated male cross-dresser, Chevalier d'Eon

During both periods, he enjoyed considerable fame in international politics, high society and popular culture.

No transvestite or transsexual, until
the late twentieth century has enjoyed such public recognition, 
acceptance and popular affection.

The portrait is seen as an 
unprecedented historic document of his identity and acceptance into 
British society at a time when men who were caught wearing women’s 
clothing were viciously persecuted. 

Acquired by the gallery for £38,000 
the painting went on show for the first time yesterday following its 
discovery by art historian Philip Mould.

At a sale Mould attended in New York the painting was mistakenly labelled 
as a portrait of an unknown woman by Gilbert Stuart, most famous for 
painting George Washington on the dollar bill.

Having brought it back to the UK it 
was only when he set about cleaning it that Mould's suspicions about the 
sex of the subject were aroused.

Historic: The purchase of d'Eon's portrait marks an historic moment for the National Portrait Gallery

He noticed stubble on the woman's face and a muscularity, suggesting an unexplained masculinity.

Speaking to The Guardian Mould said: 'Cleaning is always a revelation and on this occasion it revealed that not only was it in lovely condition but more pertinently, the Gilbert Stuart signature cleaned off revealing the name Thomas Stewart.'

Further investigation by Mould resulted in the 
identification of the sitter as Chevalier d'Eon, often referred to as 'the patron 
saint of transvestites'.

Although there are photographs in the
gallery's collection of Eddie Izzard and Grayson Perry they are not 
dressed as women, meaning d'Eon's portrait is the first painting of a 
cross-dresser to hang on the prestigious walls. 

Dr Lucy Peltz, Curator of Eighteenth 
Century Portraits, at the National Portrait Gallery, says: ‘Chevalier 
d’Eon was a figure of international fame and notoriety in the eighteenth
century, for his military, diplomatic and social exploits.

'But it is 
his courage in following his gender orientation in the face of the 
severest penalties that make this portrait one of the most  inspiring 
and fascinating images’.

Long before Chevalier lived publicly 
as a woman he was feted as a soldier, champion fencer and diplomat who 
helped negotiate the Peace of Paris in 1763, which ended the Seven Years
War.

Notorious: Chevalier d'Eon enjoyed considerable fame as Britain's first celebrated cross-dresser

Having made England his home, he 
refused to return to France when recalled, blackmailing the French crown
with threats to sell secrets to the British.

Surprisingly London society accepted d'Eon as woman and he became well known for fencing demonstrations in theatres dressed in full drag.

Despite his commitment d'Eon was not the most feminine tranvestite. As well as a noticeable six o'clock shadow he hitched his skirt when climbing the stairs and remained quite coarse and boorish.

But this didn't stop pioneering feminists, such as Mary Robinson and Mary Wollstonecraft, championing d'Eon as a shining example of female fortitude.

Interest in d’Eon has never waned with a new biography appearing approximately every 20 years between the 1830s and the 1950s.

In 1928, Havelock Ellis coined the term ‘Eonism’ to describe transvestism and this remained in use until the 1960s.

In the last 30 years, with the development of the academic discipline of Queer Studies research into d’Eon has never been more energetic.

The Beaumont Society (which is named after the Chevalier d’Eon de Beaumont) was formed in 1966 to offer advice to the transgendered community.

Today it is the largest and longest-established group to give support of this kind.
