Jailed: David Messom, 29, was convicted of fraud and handed a two-year jail term

An aggressive conman was branded 'the lowest of the low' by a judge after tricking pensioners into thinking their mobility scooters and stair lifts needed servicing.

David Messom, 29, pocketed more than £400 in August last year by duping vulnerable and fragile old people into paying for pretend repair works. 

The crook, already in prison for fraud, was handed a two year concurrent jail sentence yesterday after admitting two counts of fraud at Derby Crown Court.

Judge Stuart Rafferty QC said: 'These offences are the most despicable kind.

'You have previous similar offences and others of using aggressive sales techniques.

'People who prey on the elderly are the lowest of the low.

'You have had more justice than you deserve.

'If you come back before a court you will be waving goodbye to a very large part of the next chapter of your life.

'If you come before me with an offence like that, the starting point will be four years.'

Sarah Slater, prosecuting, told the court an 81-year-old woman received a phone call saying her mobility scooter needed a service.

She said: 'She queried it because she said she had just had her mobility scooter serviced. She was told the law had changed and they now required two services a year.'

The pensioner, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, was quoted a figure of £120 and replied: 'I'm 81, I can't afford it.'

But after Messom offered her a price of £80, the elderly woman alerted the authorities because she thought it was a scam.

In the second offence, an 84-year-old woman received a phone call from a female saying her stair lift needed a service.

Messom turned up at the woman's home saying he was going to carry out the service.

He gave her a bill and suggested she should add an extra £300 as a guarantee which would provide free breakdown repairs.

A cheque for £410 was found in Messom's pocket when he was arrested.

Emma Coverley, defending, said Messom was already serving a prison sentence of two years and nine months.

He is likely to be released in June next year but the latest sentence will extend this for a few months.
