Just weeks after victory at The Open, Rory McIlroy is spying major glory again.

The Northern Irishman posed as James Bond ahead of the USPGA Championship, and will certainly have a licence to thrill at Valhalla.

McIlroy, who became the first European golfer to win three of the four majors since the Masters was founded in 1934, is seeking his second straight major after claiming the Claret Jug at Hoylake last month.

'I've had a great run of golf and I've played well over the past few months,' the 24-year-old said.

'I said at the start of the year that golf was looking for someone to put their hand up and become one of the dominant players in the game.

'I felt like I had the ability to do that and it's just nice to be able to win a few tournaments and get back to where I feel like I should be, which is near the top of the world rankings and competing in majors and winning golf tournaments.

'I'm not necessarily sure you can call that an era or the start of an era, but I'm just really happy with where my golf game is at the minute and I just want to try and continue that for as long as possible.

And the newly-crowned world No 1 is the man on a golden run and has been installed as the bookies' favourite  after winning the WGC-Bridgestone last week.
