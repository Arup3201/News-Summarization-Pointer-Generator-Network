Raheem Sterling has been described as 'lucky' by Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher, after the Liverpool star was seen appearing to swing an arm towards the face of Swansea defender Federico Fernandez.

The incident occurred towards the end of the Reds 4-1 Premier League triumph against their Welsh opponents on Monday night at Anfield.

After shielding the ball out for a goal kick from Sterling, Fernandez was bumped into the Kop by the 20-year-old - much to the annoyance of the Argentine.

The incident came during the closing stages of Liverpool's 4-1 Premier League win against Swansea 

The pair, who had been battling against each other throughout the game, confronted one another before Sterling was seen to aim a swing at Fernandez right in front of the linesman.

Sterling's indescrestion went unpunished by referee Andre Marriner and the makeshift forward was subseqeuntly replaced by boss Brendan Rodgers - with Mario Balotelli his replacement on 82 minutes.

The incident was the second Premier League one in two days where a player has been caught on camera swinging a flailing arm towards an opponent.

On Sunday, Newcastle's Papiss Cisse elbowed Everton defender Seamus Coleman in the jaw but has since been charged retrospectively by the FA.

Speaking post-match on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show Neville said: 'He's [Sterling] a lucky boy. Cisse's been charged retrospectively today.

'I think the referee and the linesman have both seen this and Howard Webb said a few weeks ago that this is a sending off. Cisse will get a three-game ban for violent conduct but how are the referee and linesman going to give credibility where both can say they haven't seen these two incidents.

'It cannot happen where they say they haven't seen it so I think Sterling will get away with it because the referee can't put it in his report that he hasn't seen it. How he, the linesman, tomorrow, can write in his report that he didn't see it will mean that I think he will lose credibility, I really do.'

The mideamonour was the only blemish to an impressive performance by Sterling playing as the Reds' furthest forward.

Carragher added: 'I think he [Sterling] was lucky. Fernandez was tight and aggressive and earlier on in the night Sterling was frustrated with his tackling.

'He gives a push then Fernandez gives Sterling a clip with the left hand before Sterling throws his hand, it's not a punch, but we've seen people sent off for things like this.'

Victory for Liverpool moves them up to eighth in the table on 28 points after 19 games ahead of their clash against Leicester on New Year's Day.
