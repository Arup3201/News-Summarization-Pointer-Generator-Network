A former SAC Capital Advisors portfolio manager has been convicted of helping his company earn more than a quarter billion dollars illegally through insider trading.

Mathew Martoma was found guilty on Thursday on two counts of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud, putting an end to his three-week long trial that capped a decade-long investigation into SAC Captial.

While he remained expressionless as the verdict was handed down, tears streamed down the face of his wife, who sat with her hands folded on her yellow dress. He could face up to a decade behind bars.

The courtroom examination of the 
trades focused largely on his dealings with clients pertaining to the 
secret testing of a potential breakthrough Alzheimer's drug.

The
 trial also contained frequent mentions of SAC Capital's billionaire 
founder, Steven A. Cohen, who is one of the richest men in the country 
with an estimated personal net worth of $9.4billion.

Verdict: Mathew Martoma, 39, was found guilty on two counts of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud but his sentence has not been handed down

Defense lawyer Richard Strassberg said in his closing argument Monday that Cohen was the real target of investigators.

He said his client was victimized by the testimony of doctors who traded their credibility for plea deals that left them beholden to the government.

He said the doctors learned 'just how frighteningly scary it can be if you get in the way of a government investigation that's targeting someone like Steve Cohen.'

Sidney Gilman, an 81-year-old former professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School, testified that he gave Martoma the secret results of the drug trial sponsored by drug makers Elan Corp. and Wyeth nearly two weeks before they were publicly announced.

He said he was charmed by Martoma, 39,
 who seemed more knowledgeable about his work than hundreds of others in
 the financial community who paid Gilman more than $1million over 
several years for consultations.

Gilman
 said he could not recall giving similar information to anyone else, 
though he conceded that he 'perhaps unintentionally... may have slipped 
here and there'.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Arlo 
Devlin-Brown told the jury that after the doctor showed Martoma the test
 results in one of 43 consultations the pair had, Martoma sent Cohen an 
early morning email asking: 'Is there a good time to catch up with you 
this morning? It's important.'

A half hour later, they spoke for 20 minutes on the phone.

The
 next day, Devlin-Brown said, Martoma and SAC Capital began selling all 
their shares in Elan and Wyeth and building a short position that would 
make millions of dollars when the stock of both companies plummeted 
following the public announcement of the drug trial's results.

The government said the trades on both ends earned $275 million in profits, enough to score a $9.3 million bonus for Martoma.

'Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Martoma, though all of this circumstantial evidence, has been caught with his hand deep inside the cookie jar, and defense counsel wants you to think that maybe he was just putting the cookie back,' Devlin-Brown said in his closing.

The prosecutor said Gilman, formerly one of the top Alzheimer's researchers in the world, has all but ended his career.

'He's 81, and he's humiliated,' Devlin-Brown said.

Strassberg told jurors Gilman's 'story at its heart makes no sense' because his memory was flawed when he met with Martoma in 2008 while he was undergoing chemotherapy for successful cancer treatments.

Another doctor, Joel Ross, testified that he also gave Martoma secrets about the Alzheimer drug test, in part because he hoped Martoma would connect him with biotechnology companies that might provide business for his new drug research center in Eatontown, New Jersey.

SAC Capital pleaded guilty in November to fraud charges and agreed to pay $1.8billion to settle charges that it allowed, if not encouraged, insider trading for more than a decade.

Cohen has not been criminally charged, but the Securities and Exchange Commission has accused him in a civil action of failing to prevent insider trading at the company, which he founded in 1992 and bears his initials.

Cohen has disputed the allegations.

Upset: Martoma, whose wife wept openly when the verdict was handed down, paid a researcher more than $1million for consultations on yet-unreleased drugs to help him advise his clients

The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan praised Thursday's verdict, comparing Martoma's actions to buying an answer sheet before an exam.

'As the jury unanimously found, Mathew Martoma cultivated and purchased the confidence of doctors with secret knowledge of an experimental Alzheimer's drug, and used it to engage in illegal insider trading,' the prosecutors said in a statement.

'In the short run, cheating may have been profitable for Martoma, but in the end, it made him a convicted felon.'

There was no mention at trial of Martoma's educational record at Harvard Law School, where he was expelled in 1999 after he used a forged transcript he claimed he created to impress his parents to apply for a clerkship with as many as 23 federal appeals judges.

A sentencing date wasn't immediately set. Martoma's attorney declined to comment after the verdict was read.
