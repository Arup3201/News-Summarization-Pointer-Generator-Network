Everton midfielder Bryan Oviedo has pulled out of Costa Rica's friendlies against Oman and South Korea.

The Toffees have confirmed the 24-year-old is to remain on Merseyside to undergo a routine procedure to remove a small screw in his left leg which was inserted after an horrific break in January.

Oviedo made his competitive comeback with an hour-long appearance in the Capital One Cup defeat at Swansea last month and came on for the last 26 minutes of Sunday's loss against Manchester United - his first league appearance since January 20.
