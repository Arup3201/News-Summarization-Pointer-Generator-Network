A South African schoolgirl has had to have part of her little finger amputated after she was bitten by a tiger at an animal reserve.

Karla Malan was visiting Predator's Rock Bush Lodge in Rustenburg, to the north of the country, with her family when she lost part of her finger while stroking the big cat.

Her father said they had been assured that the tigers were tame and could be stroked through the fence. Indeed a tour guide proceeded to do that moments before the tiger turned on her and grabbed her hand.

Karla Malan had half of the small finger on her left hand bitten off by a tiger while visiting a wildlife park in South Africa

Speaking after the ordeal she said: 'I got such a fright, my hands and fingers were full of blood.

'My dad shoved his hand into the tiger's mouth to help me.'

Mr
Malan initially told his daughter not to get too close but was 
reassured when Zelna Blom, daughter of the lodge's owner Gert Blom, said
the tigers were hand reared.

'She said the tigers do not bite, they just nibble,' Mr Malan said. But then he heard his daughter scream 'Ow, he bit me.'

'I
saw her hand in the tiger's mouth,' he added. 'I just knew I had to let
my child loose when I pressed my hands into his mouth'.

The tigers were hand reared by Gert Blom and his family at Predators Rock Bush Lodge in Rustenburg, in northern South Africa

Mr Blom said that, although the tigers were tame, the Malans should have paid attention to signs warning not to touch them

There
are signs at the lodge telling people not to get closer than a metre 
away from the fence, according to South African newspaper Beeld.

However, they ignored the signs despite Mr Malan's initial reservations because of reassurance from park staff.

Karla
was rushed to hospital where it was discovered the tiger had bitten off
part of her little finger. Doctors then had to amputate a further 
section, to just beneath the middle joint.

Mr Blom said that, although the tigers were tame, the Malans should have paid attention to signs warning not to touch them.
