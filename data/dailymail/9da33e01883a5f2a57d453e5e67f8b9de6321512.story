Steve Bruce sat down with his tie slackened and puffed his ruddied cheeks, without speaking he had given his first answer – relief.

For having been the man who triumphantly ended Hull City's 110-year wait for European football, it would have been galling to see their dreams shattered after just seven days of continental competition.

They were 10 minutes away from such ignominy when substitute Sone Aluko struck his first goal since last September.

And Bruce said: 'You're always worried at 1-1 with 15 minutes to go.

'For all the hype and euphoria we very nearly fell at the first fence. But we stuck at it, like we always do, and got there.'

It had, however, been a struggle.

There were just 90 seconds on the clock when Tomas Malec climaxed a swift Slovakian breakaway with a low finish from 12 yards to stun a sell-out crowd.

Shane Long was then guilty of three glaring misses before Ahmed Elmohamady rose to flash home a header from Robbie Brady's centre on 27 minutes.

The second-half, however, was in danger of drifting to a sorry conclusion until Bruce injected some energy in the form of Aluko and Tom Ince.

And, with 80 minutes on the clock, Elmohamady escaped down the right, centred for Robert Snodgrass to nod back across goal and Aluko was on hand to apply an uncompromising finish.

'I honestly believe that the ability to bring people off the bench won us the game,' Bruce added.

'Bringing on Aluko and Ince gave us a freshness and I'm delighted he (Aluko) got the winner.

'He looked the best he has in seven years, physically.

'I'm delighted that he's scored a goal. We all know the kid has terrific ability. Let's hope he stays injury-free because he will be a big player for us if he does.'

Bruce went on: 'We got off to an awful start and that put everyone on edge for 25 minutes.

'We missed three or four glorious chances and you do think “are we going to get it?”.

'But thankfully we did and I'm pleased more than anything for the supporters.

'A guy came up to me before the game and said “I never thought I'd ever see this day” and that's fabulous.'

Hull will learn the identity of their playoff-round opponent today but, while Bruce expects an improvement on what was an unconvincing display, he is still keen to add to his squad.

'I always knock the door. The day I say “no” is the day I might as well pack in,' he said.

'If there is a bit of quality I will always try.'

On the evidence of this performance, he might just need one or two more to keep alive the dream of Inter Milan coming to Humberside this season.
