Cheesy festive songs are a Christmas staple... but what about a block of cheddar that tastes like turkey and all the trimmings?

That’s exactly what you could be spreading on crackers or grilling on toast after a chef created the world’s first Christmas dinner cheese.

The unique cheddar contains turkey flavouring as well as whole sprouts, pieces of carrot and festive fruit.

Christmas dinner is served: The cheese contains turkey flavouring with added carrots and sprouts

Pudding cheese: The cheddar contains brandy-soaked sultanas, raisins, currants, candied cherries, apple, cinnamon and a special Christmas liqueur

There’s also a Christmas pudding 
cheese with brandy-soaked sultanas, raisins and currants, candied 
cherries and apple, cinnamon and liqueur.

The idea for the festive cheeses came from chef and product developer at the Pilgrims Choice cheddar company, Linda Appel, 31.

‘We wanted to give the nation 
something really special and unique for Christmas which brought together
 two of our favourite foods – Christmas dinner and cheddar,’ she said.

‘So I worked to combine the two. We’ve done the same thing with 
Christmas pudding – because you can’t have Christmas without a bit of 
Christmas pudding.

‘The best bit about it, is that now you can have Christmas dinner on toast.

‘It means I can have Christmas  dinner
 whenever and as often as I like without all the hard work and hassle 
that usually comes with it.’

Both festive cheeses are available in limited quantities from the company on request.

Last Christmas, lazy chefs were given a
 quick alternative to cooking in the form of a self-heating dinner in a 
can. Including all the usual trimmings, the Christmas Dinner HotCan just
 required cooks to peel back the lid and pierce the sachet, which 
triggered a natural heat-producing reaction.

Christmas on toast anyone? You could keep enjoying a festive feast after the big day with just a slice
