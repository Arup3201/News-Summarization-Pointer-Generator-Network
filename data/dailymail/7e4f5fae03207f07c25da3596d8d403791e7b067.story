Britain's Andy Murray has been put to the test in training after being seeded sixth for the first grand slam of 2015, the Australian Open.

Murray, three times a finalist in Melbourne, reached the quarter-finals 12 months ago in his first grand slam since undergoing back surgery the previous September.

But the Brit is clearly pushing himself for full fitness ahead of the start of the Australian Open on Monday after the seedings were confirmed on Wednesday.

3 - Rafael Nadal

4 - Stan Wawrinka

5 - Kei Nishikori

6 - Andy Murray  

With the seedings following the world rankings, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams were installed as the top seeds.

Four-time winner Djokovic is looking to make up for his quarter-final exit last year at the hands of eventual champion Stanislas Wawrinka, who is seeded fourth behind Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

Spain's David Ferrer is the ninth seed following the withdrawal of US Open champion Marin Cilic with a shoulder injury, while 2008 Australian Open runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is also ruled out through injury.

The top 32-ranked women make up the 32 seeds in Melbourne, with 2008 winner Maria Sharapova seeded second ahead of Romania's Simona Halep and Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova.

Murray will discover his first-round opponent at Friday's draw, which will be attended by defending champions Wawrinka and Li Na, who was forced to retire last September because of persistent knee injuries.
