A 25-year-old man has been stabbed to death after a fight broke out at a house party.

Police and paramedics were called to Burn Closes Crescent in Wallsend, North Tyneside, shortly before 2am where they found the victim in the street with a stab wound.

He was treated at the scene but later died at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.

Northumbria Police have launched a murder investigation and believe the man, who has not been named, was at a party at an address on the street when a fight broke out involving a number of people.

It then spilled into the road where the man was found stabbed to death.

Seven people - three men aged 19, 20 and 21 and four women aged 45, 25, 21 and 19 - have been arrested in connection with the incident and are currently being interviewed in custody.

The victim's family have yet to be informed as some are from outside the local area.

DCI Christina Barrett said: 'We're in the early stages of a murder investigation and seven people have been arrested and are helping with enquiries. At this stage it's believed all those involved are known to each other.

'Early indications suggest there was a disturbance both inside and outside the address and we're working to establish exactly what has happened.

'I'd appeal for anyone in the area who saw or heard anything or has information about what happened to contact us as soon as possible.'

A post mortem examination will be carried out to establish a cause of death.

Northumbria Police Chief Superintendent Kay Blyth added: 'We understand incidents of this nature do cause concern to the community and the Neighbourhood Policing Team are out and about in the community to keep them informed and to reassure them about the ongoing investigation.

'Anyone who has concerns should speak with their local officers. I'd also urge anyone who has information about what happened to pass it on to officers at the earliest opportunity.'
