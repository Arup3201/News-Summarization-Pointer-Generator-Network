A former bookmaker was today jailed for life for murdering his wife with a Samurai sword after she discovered his secret love child.

Crazed Robert Dunson, 54, hacked his wife Jean, 47, to death with a knife in one hand and a sword in the other as she slept in her bed.

She tried to fight him off but he sank the blades into her chest, back and throat ten times at their home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, last May.

The drunken explosion came after she demanded a divorce having discovered his 14-year-old son he had kept hidden from her after an affair with his ex-wife.

Dunson was today jailed at Reading Crown Court and ordered to serve a minimum of 17 years.

The court heard how Mrs Dunson, a lawyer, noticed the teenager at the defendant’s mother’s 80th birthday party in 2010 and recognised his similarity to her husband.

Dunson admitted the betrayal and his wife filed for divorce but they continued living together in separate rooms.

Out-of-work Dunson attacked his more successful on May 4, last year.

The jury heard how his prospects without his wife were glum as he was out of work, having previously managed a William Hill bookmakers in Harlesden, North West London.

One the night of the bloodbath he drank a litre of brandy while watching sports and stalked into her room. The attack was so ferocious that one of the blades broke off in his wife's body.

Bespectacled Dunson was found by police in the kitchen with the sword hilt against the wall and the edge resting on his chest. The prosecution said during the trial that this was a 'staged' attempt by Dunson at a suicide.

His wife was then pronounced dead where she lay, with her phone dangling just yards away hinting at a final bid to call for help.

Sentencing the husband Judge John Reddihough said: 'You murdered your wife in the most violent and brutal manner, inflicting many wounds upon her with two separate knives, one of which you left embedded in her body.'

In an impact statement read in court, her sister Janet Donofrio said: 'My sister Jean was a very intelligent, articulate and caring and courageous woman. She was a daughter, sister, mother and wife.

'The pain, devastation and loss our family is feeling now are indescribable. All we have now are memories of a person who loved life.'

Mrs Dunson, described by Judge Reddihough as 'an attractive, intelligent, hard working, professional woman', was a bright pupil growing up in Watford, Hertfordshire, and went on to get a law degree from Birmingham University.

She met Dunson in the 1980s, when he was already married and had two sons but he left his wife for Mrs Dunson in 1991 and was divorced in 1992.

A year later they set up home but during an affair, between 1995 and 1996, he left his ex-wife pregnant and kept the truth secret.

The jury was read a letter Mrs Dunson had written after discovering the love child.

The letter said: 'You are a liar, a cheat and a coward. I discovered you have been lying to me for 14 years.

'You haven’t even had the decency to tell me. I feel foolish, gullible and silly.

'Typical you continued to see some sort of evil masterplan, when there was none.

'You claim you love me. Well, if the way you treated me and lied to me is love, you can keep it.'

Benjamin Adejowon Aina QC, defending, described the attack as 'an explosion of unfortunate emotion.'

He said: 'The defendant was going through a messy divorce. The defendant was suffering from a certain amount of mental illness, however slight that might have been.

'Set against that background and a number of incidents that had taken place that didn’t involve violence but unpleasant behaviour he snapped.

'He carried out the acts that he carried out, which were not characteristic.'
