Ronny Delia declared Celtic’s title bid back on track after a convincing 2-0 victory over Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on Monday night.

The Norwegian indulged in fist-pumping celebrations in front of the travelling supporters after goals from Emilio Izaguirre and Stefan Scepovic hauled them within a point of leaders Aberdeen.

Celtic will have two games in hand by the time they return from their week-long training camp in Gran Canaria – and could trail the Dons by four points.

However, inspired by an excellent display from contract rebel Kris Commons, Deila’s men offered evidence that genuine competition might yet bring out the best in them.

The Parkhead boss viewed the display as the ideal response after dropping five points in their previous two Premiership outings.

‘Aberdeen have done very well, winning nine of their last 10 games,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to cope with that but we have.

‘We are back on track again. We are going to continue winning games and if Aberdeen do the same then it is going to be a tight race all the way to the end.

‘But we are going to do our job. We can speak at the beginning of April, with six or seven games left, about who is challenging for the title.

‘It was a good performance, particularly in the first half, and we scored two good goals. It was a very good answer from the players.

‘I believe in them and this performance shows what is in the group. It was the right response after the Ross County game when we had domination but didn’t create enough chances. 

'Today we had a better tempo and created the chances we needed to win the game.’

Virgil van Dijk was again watched by Sunderland scouts at Rugby Park, but Deila will be anxious to retain his key men for what promises to be an intriguing run-in.

The Norwegian admitted Commons had been hugely influential in his first league start since November. And he expressed hope that extended agreements can yet be reached with both the 31-year-old and loanee John Guidetti, who dropped to the bench last night.

‘Especially in the first half, Kris was very good – as was the team,’ said Deila. ‘He worked very hard. There were good reactions when we lost the ball and he created a lot of our chances. 

'He did a lot of things well and that’s what I wanted to see.

‘Ninety minutes like that is what we want from Kris. If he does that, he is a very important player for us.

‘The contract situation with Kris is the same as with Guidetti and all the others. We are talking together and we will see if we can get agreement.

‘I don’t think it is so much closer with Guidetti. We will see. He is going forward with everything but the final message is still some days away.

‘He had a good attitude when he came on the pitch tonight. We know what he can do and he is an important player for the team.

‘It is just a little break for him. We know we are going to get John back on the best level again.’

Deila also insisted he had no issue with Kilmarnock rejecting a request from Celtic to be allowed to train on their artificial pitch ahead of the match.

‘We asked the question if we could train here,’ he added. ‘If they say no to that, it is their call. I don’t think so much about it.

‘For me it is no problem. I had plenty of experience of these kind of pitches in Norway. I think we showed we can play on it.’

Meanwhile, Celtic have joined West Ham and QPR in tracking Hamilton’s £2million-rated left-back Stephen Hendrie after John Collins watched the 19-year-old during the Lanarkshire side’s 1-0 win at St Johnstone on Sunday.
