George Osborne’s fashionable 5:2 diet appears to be paying off, with the Chancellor looking noticeably leaner on the breakfast TV sofa yesterday.

The Chancellor is said to have shed significant amounts of weight by cutting his calorie intake to just 500 on two days of the week - while David Cameron has sparked speculation he may also be on a new diet.

The Prime Minister, who has fought an on-off battle with his weight, tucked into low-fat options on his flight back from a trip to Tel Aviv last week, after Number 10 asked for him to be served a selection containing no dairy products.

Mr Cameron is also said to be experimenting with alternatives to standard milk, such as almond milk, which is low in calories and fat.

Downing Street said it never commented on the Prime Minister’s dietary habits.

The PM is not thought to be on a full dairy-free diet. But the revelations will spark speculation about whether Mr Cameron has decided to cut back on dairy products as part of a drive to lose weight ahead of next year’s election.

Mr Cameron’s efforts to keep in trim have been hampered by a knee injury, which has curtailed his jogging.

On the Andrew Marr Show, however, the Chancellor cut a lean figure after cutting his calorie intake twice a week

Although he has been able to take up the activity again recently, it is still only at a relatively low level.

Aides said he had been ‘pounding the streets’ in Jerusalem last week, but sources later revealed his activity had been confined to a short 10-minute jog.

The Prime Minister has spoken several times about his battle with middle-age spread.

In an interview with Now magazine in 2012 he was asked about his New Year’s resolutions and replied: ‘Probably to lose a bit of weight, I think. That’s the key one for me.’

But last summer he was photographed looking portly and sunburned on a beach while on holiday in Cornwall.

At the Conservative Party conference in October he joked that the unflattering photos of him wearing only a Mickey Mouse towel did at least demonstrate he had the ‘stomach for the fight’.

David Cameron, who has filled out since taking office in 2010, is said to be trying out dairy alternatives

In an interview in January this year the Prime Minister described himself as a ‘middle-aged, slightly overweight man’.

He said he tried to go jogging once or twice a week in parks near Downing Street, and was rarely recognised.

‘The thing about the parks in London is its mostly full of tourists who just see some middle-aged slightly overweight man trotting past them and they just think it’s another one,’ he said.

Flight records from last week confirm that a special diet was requested for Mr Cameron on his trip to Israel and Palestine. He was listed as the flight’s ‘VVIP’, with a note to say he should be served ‘non-dairy’ meals.

His main meal on the five-hour flight from Tel Aviv to London was salmon served with salad. He was also served with a snack of tacos with chicken and vegetables.

Asked about the meal selection, a Downing Street spokesman said he had ‘no comment’ to make.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, meanwhile, has taken up kickboxing in a bid to get fit and slim down for the general election, and it emerged that the Education Secretary Michael Gove spent a week at an Austrian ‘fat farm’ popular with celebrities. The £2,500 stay is said to have helped him shed two stone.
