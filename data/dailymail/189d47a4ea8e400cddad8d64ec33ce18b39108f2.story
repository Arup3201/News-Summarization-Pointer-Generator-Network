A fishery bailiff has been kicked to the ground and stabbed after challenging poachers, in the latest in a spate of attacks on wardens.

John Anderson, 53, was set upon with a Stanley knife after he challenged two men he had spotted with a dead pike in a carrier bag on the riverbank.

He was also slashed with the knife on the sleeve of one of two jackets he was wearing.

Police are now investigating the assault at Branston Water Park near Burton, Staffordshire.

Angling clubs are now said to be considering making wardens wear stab vests after a rise in riverside attacks.

It is believed the two men - described as Eastern European -  had caught and killed the pike and were planning to cook it.

Mr Anderson, whose job is to check anglers’ rod licences and fishing permits, was discovered by passersby after the attack.

The married father-of-one suffered neck and back injuries and had to be strapped to a spinal board to be taken to hospital.

Mr Anderson has been signed off work and is unsure whether he will return to his bailiff role.

The Angling Trust has warned of a rise in tensions on riverbanks due to the clash of cultures between British and Eastern European anglers.

In the UK coarse fish are caught and released by anglers in the name of sport,.

But species like pike and carp are a delicacy in Eastern European countries.

In 2012, bailiff Bob Stead, 69, was attacked when he caught two men trying to harpoon prized coarse fish with home-made spears.

He was punched in the stomach in the assault at at Stonar Lake in Sandwich, Kent.

Dilip Sarkar, fishing enforcement manager for the Angling Trust, said: 'If you are going to fishing you need a rod licence and a permit but most assaults on bailiffs are carried out when they check for these.

'All anglers have legitimate reasons to carry knives so it’s very dangerous territory.

'Although rare, the attack on John Anderson underlines just how dangerous it can be these days.

'Part of the problem is the clash of culture between UK and Eastern European anglers.

'They fish for the pot and that has caused a lot of unrest in the fishing community.

'Pike fishing in areas of the country, particularly the Fens, has been very badly damaged because instead of returning fish they kill them.

'It is not over the top that angling clubs should be considering the use of covert stab vests.'

Mr Anderson, a volunteer bailiff at the quiet waterway for 10 years, described the attack on him.

He said: 'I went over to say hello and as I got nearer I saw they had a small dead pike in a carrier bag. I hadn’t seen them before so I asked them if they were members.

'One of them disappeared and the other one reached inside his jacket pocket.

'I assumed he was going to get his rod licence but instead he pulled out a Stanley knife and came at my face with it.

'I put my arm up to defend myself but as I did so I was kicked to the ground by the other man.

'It all goes a bit hazy then but I knew at that point I was vulnerable. They could have killed me if they’d wanted.

'Luckily I was wearing two jackets that day and the blade only cut the sleeve of one of them.

'I’m now in agony. I can’t work and I’m unsure whether or not I will go back to being a bailiff.

'I have called a meeting at the fishing club and plan to propose more is done to protect bailiffs, which could include issuing discreet stab vests.'

A spokeswoman for Staffordshire police said no arrests had been made in connection with the attack, which happened around 9am on January 6.

She said: 'The first offender is described as being white, and of eastern European appearance aged between 20 and 30 with rotten teeth.

'The second offender is described as also being of eastern European appearance and taller than the first. Both had fishing rods and were carrying a bag of fish.'
