She's not long back from Mustique, but the Duchess of Cambridge will be able to top up her tan nicely thanks to another break – this time in the Maldives without her baby.

She and William have jetted out on what has been billed as a second honeymoon after they left George at home with her parents.

The couple arrived in the Maldivian capital, Male, on a British Airways flight yesterday, accompanied by several taxpayer funded Scotland Yard detectives.

They were immediately whisked from the First Class cabin into a VIP lounge before transferring on to a private hydroplane which whisked them off to a paradise isle.

The Duke and Duchess are staying at one of the most exclusive resorts in the Indian Ocean –  the five star Cheval Blanc Randheli Hotel on Noonu Atoll.

They and their party will stay in style and seclusion as the resort only has 45 villas.

The holiday comes just a month before the couple embark on a three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia – this time accompanied by George.

However, its timing is something of a surprise because William was due to be studying at Cambridge University.

The prince enrolled on the ten-week course in agricultural management on January 7, which should have seen him there until the end of this month.

At the time Kensington Palace said he would have around 20 hours a week of timetabled lectures, seminars and meetings. He was also expected to study in his own time and undertake the occasional field trip.

Last month William attracted public criticism when he went on a four-day boar shooting holiday in Spain with his brother.

The Duchess has only recently returned from a week-long family holiday with Prince George in Mustique, again with a full group of police bodyguards.

Although the couple have recently 
employed a new nanny, they made the  decision to leave eight-month-old 
George with Carole and Michael Middleton at their Berkshire mansion – 
accompanied by his own Scotland Yard security detail.

Cheval Blanc Randheli, where the couple 
are staying, is part of the elite Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy group and 
is described as an ‘intimate and contemporary haven’.

It boasts just 45 loft-style tropical villas which have a large living room, adjoining powder room, double dressing rooms and bedrooms and light-flooded bathrooms.

Each has its own 41ft infinity pool and outside dining pergola plus a private beach and spacious over-water sunbathing decks.

Unsurprisingly none of this luxury comes cheap. The hotel is too exclusive to list its prices on its website – but one tour operator offers a four-night stay at more than £6,000.

A five-course dinner in the best restaurant, without drinks, costs £350 per couple.
