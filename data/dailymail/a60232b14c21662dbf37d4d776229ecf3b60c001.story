A Russian man who entered his new flat for the first time, walked in to find the previous tenant murdered in the bathroom.

Taras Yermolayev, 45, found the dead body of alleged drug dealer Dementi Zakharov, 50, lying in a pool of blood and the flat ransacked and 'smashed up with a sledge hammer'.

Mr Yermolayev had met up with Mr Zakharov just one day earlier to pick up the keys for his new apartment in Novokuznetsk in south central Russia.  

Mr Yermolayev says the flat  had been put on the market after Mr Zakharov had stopped paying the rent, so the owner  had decided to sell it.

He had then purchased it from a online advert without even visiting it, telling police that the price was so cheap he had wanted to act quickly to make sure he grabbed a bargain.

He said: 'It was terrifying when I saw the body, like the stuff from a horror movie.

'The place looked like someone had smashed it up with a sledge hammer and then done the same to the previous tenant.

'His head looked like it had been severely battered and I didn't even recognise if the body was that of a man or woman at first.

'I immediately called the police and then vomited in the kitchen sink.'

When police arrived they sealed off the apartment and began questioning neighbours.\n\n

A police spokesman said: 'There are signs that the victim had been tortured before being murdered.

'He is known to us as a drug dealer and we suspect this was some sort of revenge attack connected to his business.

'So far the neighbours say they didn't hear anything.'

Now Mr Yermolayev says he has no intention of moving in and wants to sell the place.

He said: 'There's no way I'm going to ever feel comfortable living here knowing what happened.

'I plan to sell up as soon as the police have finished their investigation and I can get someone in to clean up this mess.

'I don't envy them.'
