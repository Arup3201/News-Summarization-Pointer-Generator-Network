William Hague said it would be harder now for a comprehensive pupil to become Foreign Secretary now

It is harder today for a state-educated teenager to reach the top than a generation ago, William Hague has admitted.

The Foreign Secretary, who attended a Yorkshire comprehensive, warned there has been a ‘disturbing’ decline in social mobility over the past three decades.

But as the row over the Cabinet being dominated by a privately-educated elite rumbles on, Mr Hague insisted he had ‘never felt socially inferior to anybody’.

Mr Hague spoke out after former Prime Minister Sir John Major condemned the ‘shocking’ way the upper echelons of society were filled by the privately-educated and affluent individuals in powerful positions.

Prime Minister David Cameron also suggested yesterday that social mobility is being held back because people from outside the white middle-class can lack the ‘aspiration’ to make it into top jobs.

Mr Hague, who attended the state Wath-upon-Dearne School, put the blame on shortcomings in the education system, which he said were being tackled by Education Secretary Michael Gove.

Mr Hague told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘I did go to a comprehensive school and I've become the Foreign Secretary so not everything goes to privately-educated people.

‘The disturbing thing, I would say, is that in the 30-odd years since I was at a comprehensive school, it probably in those intervening decades will have become a bit harder for somebody from a comprehensive school to become the Foreign Secretary, or whatever position they aspire to.

‘That reflects on a long period of this country falling too far behind in the world in state education, and thankfully we now have the best Education Secretary in living memory - or longer - who is trying to put that right.’

Mr Hague insisted he had never felt 'socially inferior' to Eton-educated Prime Minister David Cameron

Mr Hague played down the suggestion that his state-school background left him feeling ‘socially inferior’ to Eton-educated Mr Cameron.

‘I can tell you, having grown up in South Yorkshire, in Rotherham, and been to a comprehensive school, I've never felt socially inferior to anybody. And I have met most of the kings, presidents, queens and princes of the world,’ he said.

Sir John Major said the dominance of the well-heeled was 'shocking'

Ministers have been at pains to stress the work being done in education and welfare to raise achievements and aspirations of children from poorer backgrounds.

It follows Sir John’s repeated interventions in which he has spoken out about the dangers of out-of-touch well-heeled politicians indifferent to the needs of the poor.

His latest remarks were seen as a thinly-veiled reference to the wealthy backgrounds of Mr Cameron's government, in contrast to Sir John's own upbringing in a rented flat in Brixton, South London.

During a speech to the South Norfolk Conservative Association on Friday evening, Sir John said: ‘In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class.

‘To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking.’

Downing Street rejected the criticism, insisting policies to help people get on were more important than the background of politicians.

But Education Secretary Mr Gove, who was adopted at just four months, insisted Sir John was 'right'.

He told BBC Radio 4: 'It’s an inescapable fact. And that’s one of the reasons why both I was speaking today about social work and the vital need to make sure that vulnerable children don’t suffer from neglect and don’t have their futures blighted.’
