Members of the House of Lords have been attacked after claiming their exclusive restaurants had become 'downmarket'.

Peers are said to be angry that ordinary office workers with a Parliamentary pass are now allowed to join them at their taxpayer-subsidised dining areas.

Lords catering officials allowed other people into the dining hall to cut the eye-watering £2.3million subsidy.

Peers have criticised the House of Lords catering facilities for becoming 'downmarket' like high street pizza chains

The exclusive Barry Room was turned into a brasserie where ordinary workers can now bring up to six guests.

But one diner was left unimpressed – firing off a complaint against the 'downgrading' of the restaurants and 'the appalling search for mediocrity'.

Other complaints — revealed by the Sun under Freedom of Information rules — attacked the quality of food and angry staff.

One lord said he could get better food in a 'down market establishment like Prezzo or Ask'.

Another suggested the chef who had made a mushroom roll 'should be sent to Pizza Express or Zizzi and probably Cafe Rouge'.

One peer even complained he would get a better-value breakfast for £36 at London's five-star Ritz Hotel.

Last night the TaxPayers' Alliance said the complaints 'beggared belief'.

It comes after it emerged the House of Lords had refused to share catering services with MPs - because they were worried about the quality of champagne.

A plan to merge to management of bars and restaurants in both Houses of Parliament was jettisoned after peers expressed fears of being forced to drink cheap bubbly, according to a former Commons chief.

While the Lords and MPs share IT, cleaning and archive services, reaching agreement on champagne purchasing was seen as a step too far.

The House of Lords refused to merge catering contracts with the Commons because they 'feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service'

Governance committee chairman Jack Straw expressed astonishment at the revelation about champagne from former Commons Clerk Sir Malcolm Jack (right) 

A group of MPs is examining the way the House of Commons is run, following the row over John Bercow's plan to install an Australian woman as Clerk.

But one of the biggest differences has emerged over their taste in fine wines.

Former Clerk Sir Malcolm Jack revealed the tensions between the two Houses of Parliament when the committee took evidence.

He insisted that 'joint services must be a good idea' and they already exist in ICT and the running of the estate.

'Nevertheless, there are historical differences between the Houses.'

He said there had been a long running argument – lasting 20 or even 50 years – about whether the elaborately decorated Pugin Room, complete with a crystal chandelier and deep red carpets, belongd to the Commons or the Lords.

Sir Malcolm added: 'The person in charge of catering came with proposals to provide a joint catering service, and it was eventually thrown out in the House of Lords because the Lords feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service.' 

Former Labour Cabinet minister Jack Straw, chairman of the Commons governance committee, was taken aback by the claim, asking: 'Did you make that up? Is that true?'

But Sir Malcolm insisted it had happened. 'Yes, it is true, he said. 'It should not be beyond the wit of man, Chair, to brigade the services together and deliver them differently.

Former Lib Dem minister David Heath, who sits on the committee, remarked: 'You can never underestimate the capacity for self-parody in this place.'

Since 2010 the House of Lords has bought in more than 17,000 bottles of champagne at a cost of £265,770. It is the univalent of five bottles each for every peer.

A Lords spokesman said: 'The House of Lords would not reject a merger of catering services with the House of Commons simply on the supply of champagne. 

'The House of Lords catering department and subsidy is significantly smaller than that of the House of Commons, and it is not clear that any merger would produce savings in the costs of the House of Lords. All alcohol sold in the House of Lords is sold at a profit.'
