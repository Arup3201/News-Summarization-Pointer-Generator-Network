There's nothing more seductive than a juicy pair of pouting lips, so it's no wonder a survey found that 63 per cent of women would like to plump up their own pair.

But despite our lust for luscious lips only 7 per cent of women said they had no qualms with lip fillers, 15 per cent were on the fence and 78 per cent of us gave it a big thumbs down due to potential trout pout, health risks and cost.

The survey by leading beauty retailer Escentual.com questioned 1,000 women about their lip preferences.

Fear of trout pout like Tulia's, pictured above leaving court last month, is the most common reason why women avoid having lip fillers

Despite lip injectables being popular among celebrities including Amy Childs and Katie Price, women are reticent to follow their lead.

Well over half of women (60 per ecnt) said their main reason for steering clear of the cosmetic treatment was fear 'trout pout' - the wonky, disproportionate mouth that can sometimes result from the treatment.

The latest celebrity victim of the 'trout pout' was Tulisa, who appeared swollen mouthed at her recent court appearance.

Other reasons women gave for avoiding lip fillers were the potential health risks (29%) and the hefty costs of regular top-up injections (9 per cent).

Injectable lip fillers – often made from collagen, hyaluronic acid or Alloderm - usually last from several weeks to up to four months before the plumping effects fade and the treatment has to be repeated.

Rather than opting for surgery, over half of women (52 per cent) said they had tried make-up tricks to fake a fuller pout.

Emma Leslie, editor at Escentual.com, said: 'It’s definitely possible to create the illusion of plumper looking lips without having to resort to injectables.

'Applying lip liner just outside your natural lip line in a shade close to or slightly darker than your lip colour works wonders. Finish off with a moisturising lip colour in a light or natural hue – darker lipsticks can sometimes make lips appear smaller than they are.'

And the award for best lips goes to: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (left) and Angelina Jolie (right)

In third and fourth place: Kylie Jenner (left) and Scarlett Johansson (right)

'Another great tip is to add a touch of pearlescent highlighter to the centre of your lips and Cupid’s bow.

'There are a range of highly effective products out there specifically targeted at creating fuller lips.'

Some provide a natural plumping effect by feeding the delicate area around the mouth with nutrients, like DHC Revitalising Moisture Strips (£9.50 from Escentual.com). Others nourish the lips themselves, such as Smashbox O-Plump (£18 from Boots).

Escentual.com also questioned women on the celebrities whose lips they most envied. Supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley came out on top, with newlywed Angelina Jolie – long famed for her full pout – close behind.

Tulisa was voted celebrity with the least attractive lips, followed by Celebrity Big Brother contestant Lauren Goodger, who is also reported to have had lip injections.

Unsurprisingly, nearly all of the women surveyed thought Tulisa was wrong to tamper with her lips – 96 per cent of women said she looked prettier before the fillers.
