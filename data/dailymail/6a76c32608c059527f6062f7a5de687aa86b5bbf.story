Sierra Leone cyclist Mohamed Tholley is 'not missing' and his chef de mission knows his whereabouts, a Games spokesman has sai

A Sierra Leone cyclist who 'vanished' from the Commonwealth Games in an apparent bid to avoid going back to his Ebola-stricken country has been found - but several of his teammates do not want to return home.

The plea from the athletes was made as Sierra Leone sportstars failed to turn up for four separate events, sparking fears that even more of the country's athletes could be going missing.

It comes as the World Health Organisation issued a warning about the epidemic of Ebola in West Africa - which they now say has killed more than 700 people in four countries.

Unisa Deen Kargbo, chef de mission of the country's team, says his athletes are scared about returning to Sierra Leone, amid fears they will be struck down by the killer disease.

Mr Kargbo also said he would be 'investigating' why the athletes had not turned up at the various events - because he had expected them to be there.

He told the Times: 'Many people are thinking whether or 
not to go home now. Everybody is worried and many of them don't want to 
go home now because of the Ebola.

'We
 have held several meetings with them, but they are still worried. This 
virus is spreading around our country and everyone is at risk of 
catching it.'

Yesterday, Mohamed Tholley, the country's mountain biking champion allegedly failed to turn
 up to Thursday's time trial. Officials admitted they were concerned he was trying to abscond, to avoid returning to Sierra Leone.

Today, a spokesman for Glasgow 2014 said he was 'not missing' and the chef de mission knew his whereabouts. 

But yesterday, Sierra Leone’s men’s and women’s 4x400m
 relay teams also mysteriously withdrew from first round heats at 
Hampden Park. The men's 4x100 team also did not run.

Organisers were apparently given no explanation. Asked about the non-appearance, a Games spokesman said: ‘I don’t know.’

There have now been four events - including the time trial of Mr Tholley - which Sierra Leone’s athletes have entered but not started.

Mr
 Kargbo said: ‘I was at 
Hampden Park expecting to see the boys and girls in the relay. I don’t know where they are. I am going back to the village to find out what has happened.’

He was not available for comment when MailOnline tried to contact him about the missing athletes today.

According to the chef de mission of the team, members of the Sierra 
Leone delegation, pictured here at the opening ceremony, do not want to return home because of fears they will 
catch the Ebola virus

Chef de mission of Sierra Leone's Commonwealth Team Unisa Deen Kargbo, 
pictured right meeting the Queen at the Games, made the comments earlier today

But he added today that he was determined to get his athletes home, saying: 'Athletes have come to me and
 said they don't want to return because of the Ebola situation.

'There 
have been discussions with back home to see what the final decision will
 be on that. I have a mandate to return the athletes on 5 August and that's what I'm working towards now.'

Asked if the athletes could stay on in the UK, he said: 'The UK government will have to decide if that's an option, but I don't know.'

The drama in the Sierra Leone camp came after it was revealed 
earlier this week that cyclist Moses Sesay, 32, had been admitted to a Glasgow 
hospital and tested for various conditions, including Ebola. 

The Ebola virus is fatal in 90 per cent of cases and there is no vaccine and no known cure.

The team coach Winston Crowther 
also last night revealed that a second team member, table tennis player 
Samuel Morris, 34, had spent four days being tested in isolation. Both were tested negative for the disease.

But
 cyclist Mr Sesay, 32, said: ‘I am scared to be going back because it is
 very difficult, people are frightened of Ebola.

‘We
 are supposed to leave just after the competition but I don’t know. On 
our passports we have three month visas. All of us are scared of 
returning. If I have the opportunity I will stay here for a while 
because of Ebola.’

Teammate Jimmy Thoronka, 20, a sprinter, said he, too, wanted to extend his visa after learning his uncle had contracted Ebola.

‘My visa is until September but I want to stay longer,’ he said. ‘We are safe here and it’s dangerous there.’

Cyclist Moses Sesay was isolated for four days in Glasgow while he was tested for a number of conditions, including Ebola

Mr Sesay had also said yesterday he believed
 Mr Tholley had left without even competing because he 
was afraid of Ebola and did not want to return home.

He said many of the 26 Sierra Leone athletes in Scotland shared his missing friend’s fears.

Meanwhile, Commonwealth Games 
Federation admitted it had no idea where Mr Tholley had gone because a spokesman said it 
had not been reported to them.

The spokesman said the village was very big and many athletes sometimes left the village to 'go shopping or to visit Grandma in Edinburgh'.

He
 added that most athletes had visas which went beyond the competition, meaning they were legally allowed to remain in the UK for some time 
- and therefore the CGF could not always keeps tabs on their whereabouts.

He said: 'There is not an awful lot we can do, or say, about the situation.'  

At the London 2012 Olympics, 82 athletes, coaches and officials claimed political asylum. Police admitted last year that they were still looking for 21 people who had vanished after the Games.

But Jackie Brock-Doyle, a spokeswoman 
for Glasgow 2014, said it would not be possible for the athletes to stay
 on in the village, even if they wanted to.

She
 said: 'The athletes' village closes on Wednesday and is being 
decommissioned on Thursday, so it will become a building site within a 
matter of hours.

The Ebola crisis has been blamed for 729 deaths in an outbreak in four west African countries, including Sierra Leone. Here, two medics are seen carrying an Ebola patient in Kailahun, Sierra Leone

'We had a 
meeting with the chef de mission this morning and all his plan to take 
his entire team back to Sierra Leone on their flight on Tuesday still 
stands.'

Speaking about those who had been tested for Ebola, a spokesman added: 'Glasgow 2014 adheres to patient confidentiality in all medical matters and cannot discuss individual cases.

'Following reports to media from members of the Sierra Leone team, we can confirm two athletes from Sierra Leone were tested for Ebola as part of a series of tests undertaken last week when they presented as unwell. Both tested negative for Ebola.'

After
 this year's London marathon, a runner from Sierra Leone, 24-year-old 
Mami Konneh Lahun, went missing after finishing the race in 20th place.

She failed to turn up at an airport when she was due to fly home, but police later found her safe and well.

Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, that affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees.

The virus is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals.

A plane carrying one of two U.S. aid workers infected with the deadly Ebola virus has left Liberia for the United States, a spokesperson for the charity Samaritan's Purse said on Saturday.

The plane was carrying Dr. Kent Brantly, the spokesperson said, but could not provide a time for its arrival in the United States.

The second Samaritan's Purse staff member, missionary Nancy Writebol, is due to be transported on a later flight, as the plane is only equipped to carry one patient at a time.

The charity said on Friday the medical evacuations should be completed by early next week.

Once a person becomes infected, the disease can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen.

Sesay was given the all clear and 
released from hospital in time to compete in the men's individual time 
trial at the Games on Thursday.

The father of one, who competed in the Games on his 32nd birthday, finished last in his race.

He had arrived in Glasgow among a 
team of two dozen competitors and officials the week before the Games 
and felt unwell last Thursday, the day after he attended the Opening 
Ceremony.

‘All of us are scared about going back,' he said. 'We 
have a three-month visa in our passports and if I have the opportunity, I
 will stay here until it ends.

‘It is scary over there. My mother is a medical nurse so she may have to treat people.  My wife is also doing work in the medical field.’

Meanwhile table tennis player Mr 
Morris spoke of his illness. He said: ‘The doctor told me I am free from
 Ebola. They did the test. They kept me for three or four days, I was 
really sick. After the tests, one or two days later they let me out.’

At the games today three athletes who have made as many headlines outside the Glasgow 2014 stadiums as they have for their sporting prowess will compete for Commonwealth glory today.

Usain Bolt is appearing in a final of the men's athletics, after leading Jamaica to victory in the qualifying heats at Hampden last night.

The much-anticipated appearance of the world's fastest man has been overshadowed by controversial comments attributed to him in The Times newspaper, in which he reportedly said the games were 'a bit s***' and he was 'not really' having fun in Scotland.

The six-time Olympic champion made his Commonwealth Games debut after he missed the event in Melbourne in 2006 through injury and opted to skip the 2010 Games in Delhi.

Diver Tom Daley will be back in action in the men's 10m final after coming agonisingly close to Commonwealth Games gold in the synchronised event last night after a near-perfect final dive which left Daley and teammate James Denny settling for silver.
