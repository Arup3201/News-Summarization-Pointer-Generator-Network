'Alps of MIT': This five-story mound of snow, on campus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was piled up by plows from the six feet of snow which has fallen around the Boston area. The coming storm could add even more to it

Snow hope: The storm, which is working its way towards the east coast from over the Great Lakes, could bring a foot of snow to the already-pummeled Boston area, with Maine due even more

Blow, winds: Gale-force gusts were predicted for parts of the coast - and even inland areas were due high winds in the coming storm

Meanwhile, blowing snow led to whiteout conditions across Ohio on Saturday, causing numerous accidents and pileups that shut down interstates. 

At least three people were killed in separate afternoon accidents on the Ohio Turnpike and Interstate 71, while a wave of heavy snow limited visibility at the Columbus airport and forced all flights to be grounded for a few hours.

A pregnant woman died in a multivehicle pileup that closed the westbound lanes of the Ohio Turnpike just east of Sandusky, authorities said. Another crash on the turnpike about 30 miles east of the Indiana state line left one person dead. Ohio State Highway Patrol said a 24-year-old Buffalo, New York, man also was killed when the car he was riding in on I-71 in Morrow County hit a tractor-trailer and went off the road.

Forecasters added that the most severe weather was poised for the New England coast on Sunday.

According to New York City Mayor de Blasio, lows of almost 0°F could hit his city - the worst cold experienced in twenty years. Further north and inland the cold be even more extreme. With wind chill factored in, the cities of Buffalo and Syracuse were due to feel as cold as -21°F Midday Sunday.

It prompted authorities to issue blizzard warnings for eastern Massachusetts, southern Maine, most of New Hampshire as well as Long Island, parts of Connecticut and Rhode Island.

The winds - with peak speeds of 75mph - are being predicted for Sunday, while across the region temperatures hover not far above 0°F.

Frigid temperatures combined with the high winds will being outside in the worst-hit areas feel more like standing in a brutal -21°F, according to forecasters.

In areas hit by extreme snowfall in recent weeks, the driving wind could whip up snow on the ground and cut visibility virtually to zero, putting lives at risk for any caught outside unexpectedly.

The strong winds could also cause chaos by felling trees and destroying above-ground power lines, leading to outages across the pummeled frozen areas - some of which will be colder than they have been in 20 years.

Boston, which has received about 6 feet of snow
in a trio of record-setting storms over the past three weeks, is
bracing for as much as 14 inches of new accumulation,
forecasts indicate.

Blizzard conditions are also expected in Rhode Island,
eastern Connecticut, New Hampshire and coastal Maine,
AccuWeather predicted.

Farther south, snow accumulation up to three inches was expected from Washington D.C. to New York City. 

With the newest band of winter weather, the town of Alton,
New Hampshire called off its annual ice carnival set for the
weekend due to concerns over massive snow squalls and freezing
wind.
