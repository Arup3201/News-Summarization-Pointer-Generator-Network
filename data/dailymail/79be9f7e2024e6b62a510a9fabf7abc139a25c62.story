People have used a mouse to control their computers ever since the machines became mainstream enough to invade the home.

But now there is a new batch of hands-free technology that claims to be more intuitive, accurate than fun than the handy hardware, which was invented around 70 years ago.

A start-up called Thalmic Labs, based in Waterloo, Ontario in Canada, is about to release a smart armband that lets people control their computers by using hand gestures.

The Myo band (pictured) lets people control their computers by using hand gestures - some of which are pre-set and others which will evolve over time

Software: Thin design housing an ARM Cortex M4 processor and haptic feedback

Communication: Bluetooth 4.0 low energy

Sensors: Proprietary EMG muscle activity sensors, and a three axis gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer

Power: Micro USB

Charging: Rechargeable lithium ion battery

Weight: 95grams

Colours: Black and white

Shipping date: September 2014

Cost: $149 (£87)

The Myo band can do this because it contains sensors that measure the motion and electrical activity in the wearer’s arm muscles.

From this information, it can interpret certain hand gestures as well as movements to execute the relevant instructions on a computer screen.

This is different to some competing controllers, such as Microsoft’s Kinect, which relies on a camera to monitor someone’s movements.

A final version of the $149 (£87 plus shipping) device is set to be released in September and its makers claim it will work with Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

It connects with compatible computers and tablets via a Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy connection.

The device contains a Lithium Ion battery, which can be recharged so that it can be used for a few days.

Weighing in at around the same as a chunky wristwatch, the device is designed to fit almost any arm because it can be worn in different ways, as long as it is positioned on the upper forearm.

‘Our team has put countless hours into creating the sleek design, as well as the technology inside of it,’ said Stephen Lake, CEO and Co-founder of Thalmic Labs.

‘This final design is rugged, while also being lightweight, making it easy for the Myo armband to become a part of our everyday lives.’

The team of engineers who created the device have pre-set some gestures for users to learn, but these will be added to by developers. The firm says that with time, a number of apps will also be available after launch.

It could be adapted to control TVs and radio-controlled cars, giving people a break from hunting for mislaid remote controls.

The computer mouse has had a 
good run, but almost 70 years since the design was first patented, it is
 now under threat from a smart ‘thimble’.

The
 wearable 3D Touch device is fitted with an accelerometer and gyroscope,
 and lets people control an onscreen mouse using just a wave of their 
finger. 

The device, 
created by engineers at the University of Wyoming, uses a 3D 
accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope to orientate where the pointer
 should be.

The 'thimble' also uses optical flow sensors to track movement against a 2D surface.

A button between the forefinger and thumb is used in place of the left-click button on a standard mouse.

All
 of this location data is streamed to a laptop and is used to move the 
cursor, it can also be used with touchscreen-style gestures such as 
double tap and long press.

By
 combining data from all of the sensors, the 3DTouch can more accurately
 determine the location on the screen, and the researchers claim it can 
be used to move a 3D object with a positioning error of only about 1 mm.
