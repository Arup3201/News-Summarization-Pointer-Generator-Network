Millions of families could benefit from a crackdown on water bills, as David Cameron tries to seize back the cost of living agenda.

Ministers will announce a package of measures to shake up the market next week, to ensure customers get a ‘good deal’.

While households have no choice over their water supplier, it is expected to include more discounts or ‘social tariffs’ for pensioners and the low paid.

This would also help reduce the soaring burden of bad debts – worth around £1.6billion a year – which firms currently add to the water bills of other households.

Unlike energy firms, whose prices are
hiked every year by the Big Six firms, annual water bills, currently an
average of £388 per family, are set in advance by industry regulator 
Ofwat.

But water firms have been criticised 
for using legal loopholes to avoid £1billion of corporation tax, and 
paying millions of pounds in bonuses to their executives during last 
year’s hosepipe ban.

The move comes as Labour leader Ed 
Miliband called for the water industry to be ‘scrutinised’ to ensure it 
is not ripping off customers.

The coalition has been stung by claims it has failed to act on easing the squeeze on family finances, with Mr Miliband taking the lead with his promise to freeze gas and electricity bills for two years if he wins the next election.

But today Number 10 insisted Mr Cameron ‘wants to see household costs coming down’ and targeting the water industry will be the next stage.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has already offered water customers in the South West a £50 rebate to tackle historically high bills.

However, the new action to be set out by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is likely to offer help to customers across England with the details expected to be agreed this weekend.

Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘Clearly the Prime Minister wants to see household costs coming down.

‘There will be some progress next week which Defra will be doing on the water industry and water bills.’

The government had already taken 
action to freeze council tax bills, limit rail fare rises and cancel 
increases in the cost of MoTs, he added.

Water
watchdog Ofwat is preparing to block an eight per cent rise in charges 
demanded by Thames Water for next year, which would add an extra £28 to 
the average bill.

The No.10 
spokesman added: ‘The Prime Minister wants regulators there to look at 
the industries they regulate and make sure that they are as robust and 
delivering what they need to deliver for customers.

‘The Prime Minister realises that families are hard-pressed. He wants to see prices brought down across the board.’

Options being considered include making social tariffs for the poorest customers compulsory, capping fare rises to an amount linked to inflation and cutting the bad debt caused by customers who refuse to pay which adds £15-a-year to every bill.

Costs: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is to rush out action to limit water bill rises in an attempt to take back control of political debate over the cost of living

Details of the action on water bills are expected to be announced in the middle of next week, with Downing Street denying it had been caught on the hop by Mr Miliband.

Chancellor George Osborne signalled the government's plans in a speech last month when he said: 'There are important improvements we can make to the scale of energy and water bills, the cost of housing, the fees paid for everyday financial services, the expense of rail and road travel.

'These are a burden on families – and we are doing everything we can do to reduce their cost – with more to come this autumn.'

But Mr Miliband appeared to steal a march on the government yesterday with his warning that the industry could not escape scrutiny at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet.

Warning: The government actions comes after Labour leader Ed Miliband said the water industry should be next to face more scrutiny

‘I think we should be looking at all markets to make sure they are working  properly and that includes the water industry,’ he told the Western Morning News yesterday.

‘Some people will say this is an anti-business agenda. I think it is a pro-business agenda that you have got to reform markets that are not working properly.

‘I think the water industry is something that should be scrutinised to make sure it is working properly and make sure it is working properly for the benefit of consumers, because I know concerns have been raised.

‘I'm proud Labour is championing this agenda and I think it is consistent with believing what a market economy can do, and water is part of that.’

A Defra Spokesperson said: 'The Government is working across the board to reduce the cost of living and help hardworking households who are feeling the pinch.

'We want to ensure customers get a good deal from the water sector and will be setting out our approach next week.'

Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary said: 'David Cameron has never shown any interest in rising water bills and has wasted three years doing absolutely nothing to address the impact on already over-burdened family budgets.

'More than two million households, over one in ten, now spend more than five per cent of their income on water according to the regulator and customers in Britain face some of the highest bills in Europe.

'Yet David Cameron still refuses to require water companies to introduce a social tariff to help those who are struggling, even though only three companies have introduced such a scheme under the current voluntary arrangement.

'That’s why Labour will use the forthcoming Water Bill legislation to require all water companies to participate in a national affordability scheme and review whether there is a need for a tougher regulatory regime.'

It comes after figures this week showed the squeeze on family budgets has lasted for four years and shows no sign of coming to an end, grim new figures revealed today.

Disposable incomes have remained almost unchanged since the end of the recession, with the return to economic growth having little impact on ordinary people’s spending power.

Instead bills for life’s essentials like housing, energy and petrol have dramatically eaten into incomes, and now account for more than 27 per cent of all spending.

The Office for National Statistics warned the economic position of households ‘remains under pressure’.

Disposable incomes grew even when Britain was plunged into recession in mid-2008, but have remained ‘broadly flat’ since the summer of 2009, despite the economy growing by 4.2 per cent since then.

In particular big rises in energy bills have had a devastating impact on families.
