Branden Grace made a decisive eagle on the 16th to win the Qatar Masters on Saturday by one stroke and clinch his sixth European Tour title.

The South African shot a final round 6-under 66 for an overall 19-under 269 to hold off runner-up Marc Warren (67) of Scotland.

Bernd Wiesberger's two bogeys on the second and third holes proved costly as the Austrian settled for third place at 17 under.

Grace's eagle came after he drove to five feet on the par-four No. 16 and then finished with his fourth birdie on the last hole.

"It was a great day, a great week, and it's another trophy to put in the cupboard," said Grace.

"The form has been there, I played great and I managed to get in on top."

On Friday Grace hit a superb snap-hook wedge from the trees on the fifth which resulted in a birdie and set up a third-round 68 after a struggling start.

Grace has now won all six European Tour events which he has been leading or sharing the lead going into the final round. It was his second victory of the 2015 Race to Dubai after winning the Alfred Dunhill Championship at home.

Going into the final round, Grace and Warren were tied for the lead with Emiliano Grillo of Argentina and Wiesberger. But France's Gregory Bourdy mounted the challenge by firing in six birdies on the first nine holes before he slipped with a bogey on the 15th for a 7-under 65.

Korea's Byeong-Hun An shot 65 but missed a crucial birdie on the last hole to miss out.

Warren started well with birdies from 10 and 15 feet respectively on the first two holes, but double bogeyed at the eighth when his tee shot landed in water.

Warren recovered through birdies at Nos. 9 and 10 as Grace went 10 holes without a birdie before finding one at the 12th from 10 feet.

Even after Grace's eagle on the 16th, Warren found a birdie on the same hole. Warren tied the scores again with another brilliant tee shot on the par-3 17th for a birdie, but couldn't match Grace's birdie at the last hole.

Eddie Pepperell's back-nine 32 gave the Englishman fourth place after a 67. An, Bourdy and Grillo (70) were tied for fifth on 15 under.
