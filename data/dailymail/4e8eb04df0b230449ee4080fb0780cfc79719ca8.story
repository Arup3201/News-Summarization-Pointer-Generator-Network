An 18-year-old accused of using a sickle to beat his five-year-old niece to death has appeared in court wearing a full-body 'suicide smock'.

Matthew Kaleb Pierson has been charged with murder after he confessed to killing Jada Beth Williams with the farming blade and stuffing her bloodied corpse in a plastic container in the family garage.

A preliminary autopsy found that the girl died of blunt force injury to the head, face and neck at the home in Jackson Township, Ohio.

Charged with murder: Matthew Kaleb Pierson, 18, appears at Hillsboro Municipal Court, Ohio wearing a suicide smock

Unexplained: The teenager allegedly beat his five-year-old niece to death at their home on Saturday with a scythe

Pierson entered court on Tuesday with his hands bound and wearing a 'suicide smock'. Authorities said it was standard procedure for a person accused of such a crime to be put in the gown.

Anti-suicide smocks are made from quilted nylon Cordura - a material ten times tougher than a pair of denim jeans. It cannot be torn, folded or rolled to prevent prisoners hanging themselves.

Authorities found the tool at the 
home, east of Cincinnati, where the child's body was also discovered, 
Highland County Sheriff Ron Ward said.

It wasn't clear which part of the
tool might have been used in the beating.

The
child's body was found on Sunday, dumped in a plastic container at the 
home where she lived with the accused and her grandmother.

The grandmother called 911 on Sunday afternoon, saying the girl was dead and covered in blood.

Pierson
told authorities he killed his niece on Saturday at the house and 
described a weapon used to strike her, Detective Randy Sanders said in 
an affidavit filed in Hillsboro Municipal Court. 

Pierson also talked about 'placing the body in the position in which Jada's body was found'.

Motive unclear: Matthew Kaleb Pierson, 18, has been charged with the murder of his five-year-old niece Jada Beth Williams in Ohio

A motive for the murder was not clear. A judge set bail at $500,000 during Pierson's arraignment on Tuesday.

Highland
County Prosecutor Anneka Collins declined to comment but said more 
charges were possible. A preliminary hearing has been set for August 23. 

Other people may be charged in 
connection with the girl's murder, said Highland County Sheriff Ron Ward
at a press conference on Monday.

A 38-year-old man who owns the house had been held as a person of interest but was later released.

According to the Fayette Advocate, a search warrant revealed several people were at the home on Saturday night and were aware that something might have happened to the little girl.

One woman present said she thought she saw 'blood on the carpet in the front room' and that there 'might be a body out there'.

Another woman present at the house reportedly told her it was a 'doll'.

Sheriff Ward said: 'Part of the investigation goes to who had care/custody of this child. Someone failed this child.'
