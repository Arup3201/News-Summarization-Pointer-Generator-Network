Callum McGregor claimed his first Celtic goal on his competitive debut on Tuesday night to clinch a valuable victory for the Scottish champions — then described it as a dream come true.

And new boss Ronny Deila predicted a bright Parkhead future for the 21-year-old after he marked his return from a season-long loan at Notts County with the decisive strike in the first leg of the second-round Champions League qualifier against KR Reykjavik.

The Norwegian was relieved to secure his first competitive win in charge thanks to McGregor’s deflected effort six minutes from time in his first start for the senior team.

Celtic can now ease their way into the third qualifying round at Murrayfield next Tuesday despite KR coach Runar Kristinsson insisting the tie is not over.

‘I’m just delighted to get the win and to score the winning goal was unbelievable,’ said McGregor. ‘I have to pinch myself to see if it’s real or not.

‘I found out I was playing a few hours before the game and I had a bit of time to get my head around it. I was a bit nervous at the start. But once I was out there, it was fine.’

Determined to claim his Parkhead chance after scoring 14 goals in 35 starts for County in England’s League One, the youngster insisted: ‘I do feel ready for this. Going on loan to Notts County in League One was a big help for me. I feel like I’ve come back a better, stronger player. I feel mentally ready for this challenge.

‘I’m delighted with the goal and I’ll enjoy it, but I need to keep working. Once I get back into training on Thursday, I will get the head down again and keep striving to get better.

‘I scored a lot of goals but that was the biggest of my career - to score in the Champions League for Celtic.I’ve been at the club since I was nine and it’s a dream come true for me.

‘How did it feel? There was a bit of relief but I was delighted. The club is striving to get Champions League football and that might be the goal that puts us through. I’m delighted.

‘The manager has been excellent for me so far. He gives me confidence and has allowed me to be free and go and play. That suits me and he put a lot of faith in me against KR. Hopefully I repaid that with the goal. Hopefully I have made a good first impression.’

Afterwards, Deila told McGregor he has a big future at Celtic if he continues to improve and develop.

‘It was very early in the week I decided to play him because I knew he was the best in that position,’ said the Norwegian. ‘So that was not the hardest decision. People have to develop, that’s what I’ve said all the time. If people get better, they can stay. If they never get better, then they have a problem – and I have a problem.

‘It’s about how you work in training and what you do in matches and so far Callum has been fantastic.’

Relieved to end his first match in charge with a narrow, if laboured, win, Deila insisted he was delighted with the performance, adding: ‘I love to win, I am here to win. But I also need to win in a certain way, as well. Today was a step forward in how we want to play and that’s what I’m most happy for.

‘If we win and play s**t, then I’ll get more irritated. But today, if we’d been 0-0, I’d have been perfectly happy because I know we’re going to score goals in the next leg, as well.

‘Of course there’s relief to get that first win. We deserved more from this game, but I’m looking forward and I took a lot of energy from this. I liked what I saw of the team in the second half and I want more.’

Disappointed KR coach Kristinsson insisted the tie isn’t over despite his part-time side facing a mountainous task in Edinburgh next week.

‘It’s still alive,’ he said. ‘1-0 is nothing in football and although it is going to be difficult, if we defend well then we will go with a good attitude to Scotland and believe we can do something there. We gave them a game today and not many people expected that. We will give them another game next week.’
