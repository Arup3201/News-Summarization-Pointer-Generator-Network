Crashing waves from storm swells may melt Antarctic sea ice far faster than previously believed.

Researchers have found that large ocean waves can flow through ice packs for hundreds of miles before their force is weakened.

Experiments
 in Antarctica by a New Zealand-led team revealed these wave movements 
are strong enough to break up the ice and trigger melting.

Scientists
 positioned sensors at difference distances from the edge of ice packs 
and recorded what happened when strong waves roared over the surface.

For smaller waves, less than 9.8 feet (3 metres) in height, the up and down movement caused by the waves quickly weakened.

But for larger waves, the movement through the ice went on for up to 217 miles (350km).

Hydrodynamics
 scientist, Dr Alison Kohout, of the National Institute of Water and 
Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand, said increasing storminess 
in the Southern Ocean could accelerate sea ice retreat in the future.

‘Waves
 propagating through the Marginal Ice Zone leave behind a wake of broken
 ice floes, which are then more easily broken up and deformed by winds 
and currents,’ she said.

‘This
 mixing and churning eliminates the sea ice barrier between the air and 
the ocean and increases heat exchange between the atmosphere and the 
ocean.’

The
 MIZ is a region of broken ice floes, hundreds of kilometres wide, that 
forms at the boundary of the open ocean and the pack ice.

Predicting the scale of ice breakup requires an understanding of how far waves move into it.

‘We
 found that the retreat and expansion of the sea ice edge correlated 
with significant wave height increases and decreases respectively,’ she 
said.

The Aurora Australis navigates sea ice in the Southern Ocean. Dr Kohout said that since the days of Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton, it has been known that waves play a role in breaking-up sea ice, but this role has not been well understood

‘A two metre increase in significant wave height over a decade led to a two degree latitudinal retreat in ice extent.’

Dr
 Kohout found that the largest increases in wave height occurred in the 
Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea, where regional sea ice retreat is well 
documented.

Similarly, the largest wave height decreases were in the Western Ross Sea, where sea ice has expanded.

Dr
 Kohout said that since the days of Antarctic explorer Ernest 
Shackleton, it has been known that waves play a role in breaking-up sea 
ice, but this role has not been well understood.

‘Our
 results suggest that sea ice is vulnerable to changes in storminess. 
The southward shift in storm tracks over recent decades has resulted in 
fewer cyclones at mid latitudes and more cyclones at higher latitudes,’ 
Dr Kohout said.

‘In
 the future, wave heights are predicted to increase everywhere at the 
sea-ice edge in the Arctic and Antarctica. So it is conceivable that 
this will accelerate sea-ice retreat.’

The
 Antarctic ice sheet is more unstable than first thought with a new 
study suggesting melting began 5,000 years earlier than previously 
believed.

The
 study reveals that shrinking of the vast ice sheet accelerated during 
eight distinct periods between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago causing a 
rapid sea level rise.

During
 one period 14,600 years ago, melting glaciers released so many icebergs
 into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5ft (2 metres) in just 100 years. 

The
 results provide the first clear evidence for dramatic melting in 
Antarctic's and reflect predictions for the region's future.

It
 also follows recent news that destabilisation of part of the West 
Antarctic ice sheet has already begun and could be 'unstoppable.'

The study was conducted by an international team including researchers from Germany, Canada, Hawaii, Lapland and Australia.

Periods of rapid increase in iceberg-rafted debris suggest that more icebergs were being released by the Antarctic ice sheet.

The
 researchers discovered increased amounts of debris during eight 
separate episodes beginning as early as 20,000 years ago, and continuing
 until 9,000 years ago. 

Up until now, melting of Antarctic ice sheet wasn't thought to have started until 14,000 years ago.
