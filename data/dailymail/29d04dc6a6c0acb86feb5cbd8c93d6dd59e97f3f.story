A ground-breaking study has revealed that a shocking 664 jihadi attacks were carried out around the world in November alone, resulting in the deaths of more than 5,000 people.

The deadly toll of militant-related violence was equivalent to one attack and seven deaths every hour - or three attacks on the scale of the July 21, 2005, bombings in London every day for a month.

The figures revealing the extend of jihadist carnage around the world emerged as chilling images of a man being hurled off a building by Islamic State fighters on the Syria-Iraq border simply for being gay were posted online.

IS, now the most notorious Islamist terror group, has carried out beheadings, crucifixions and massacres while capturing huge swathes of Iraq and Syria as it rules its seized territory with an iron fist.

It has handed out barbaric punishments for actions they see as violating their strict interpretation of Islamic law, such as adultery, stealing and blasphemy.  

In a statement seeking to justify the gruesome slaying of the homosexual man, somewhere on the Syria-Iraq border, it said: ‘The Islamic court in Wilayet al-Furat decided that a man who has practiced sodomy must be thrown off the highest point in the city, and then stoned to death.’

Wilayet al-Furat refers to an area where the Euphrates river flows across the frontier from Syria into Iraq.

It is the third time in less than a month the jihadist group has hurled someone off a roof and then stoned them to death for alleged homosexuality, says the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The fresh tyranny came as the survey, the first of its kind, was conducted by the BBC World Service and the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR).

It found that in a single month, 664 reported jihadist attacks were carried out in 14 countries, resulting in a staggering 5,042 deaths. 

The worst single day was Sunday, November 2, when 410 people were killed in 41 attacks across the world.

The majority of those killed were citizens (2,080), followed closely by a large number of military personnel (1,723), as the jihadists tried to undermine and topple countries. Of the 83 politicians or officials murdered, half were in Afghanistan and Somalia.

Some 935 jihadists also died – including radicalised British Muslims fighting for IS – incorporating 38 suicide bombers who were responsible for slaughtering 650 innocent people.

Deadly: Boko Haram, which has been terrorising Nigeria and Cameroon – including the kidnapping of more than 250 schoolgirls (pictured) – carried out fewer attacks but these were large and deadly, killing 801 people

Sixteen jihadist groups were responsible for the bloodshed. Islamic State was the deadliest group, launching 308 attacks across Iraq and Syria which left 2,206 people dead – 44 per cent of the total fatalities.

Boko Haram, which has been terrorising Nigeria and Cameroon – including the kidnapping of more than 250 schoolgirls – carried out far fewer attacks, just 30, but these were large and deadly, killing 801 people.

Some 151 incidents were attributed to the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan in which 720 people died.

The four countries worst affected by jihadist strikes – Iraq, Nigeria, Syria and Afghanistan – accounted for 4,031, or 80 per cent, of all deaths. Iraq bore the brunt with 1,770 people – mostly military or civilian – killed, followed by Nigeria (786), Afghanistan (782) and Syria (693).

Other nations terribly blighted by jihadist terrorism included Yemen (410), Somalia (212) and Pakistan (212), where Al Qaeda offshoots operate with deadly menace.

Bombing accounted for the most deaths – 1,653 people killed in 241 blasts. The deadliest single attack was the assault on the Grand Mosque at Kano, Nigeria, on November 28 in which 120 died.

Gun attacks claimed 1,574 lives, and 666 deaths were described as ambushes, although many of these will have involved shooting. Some 426 people were executed including 50 who were beheaded in Syria, Yemen and Libya.

Peter Neumann, director of the ICSR, based at Kings College, London, said: ‘The data highlights the significant human cost of jihadism. It also makes clear that jihadists and al Qaeda are no longer one and the same.

‘Sixty per cent of jihadist deaths were caused by groups that have no formal association with al Qaeda. The overall picture is that of an increasingly ambitious, complex, sophisticated and far-reaching movement.

‘It seems obvious that the jihadist movement - which, only three years ago, everyone expected to be in a state of terminal decline - are stronger than ever, and that countering them will be a generational challenge.’

Tom Keatinge, of the Royal United Service Institute think-tank, said there was ‘only so much’ Britain and the international community, which has carried out airstrikes against IS fighters and sent troops to train local soldiers and militias, could do to stop IS.

He said: ‘Ultimately, it will be the local people suffering from water shortages, food rationing, and power cuts that will need to determine to rid themselves of the yoke of IS as their relationship withers.’

Andrew Whitehead, of BBC World Service News, said: ‘Every week, every day, acts of violence by jihadist groups are making news headlines.

‘With this initiative, we are seeking to find out more about the overall impact of those groups pursuing violence in the name of jihad.’
