David Cameron yesterday tore up an order banning troops from wearing their uniforms in public that was issued in the wake of the Woolwich attack.

He is understood to have told Defence Secretary Philip Hammond he was ‘seriously dismayed’ at official guidance given to personnel in London following the murder.

As the row raged in Whitehall, troops and their families posted pictures of themselves in full uniform online, in defiance of the ruling from the Ministry of Defence.

Strength: Prime Minister David Cameron gave a statement in Downing Street, vowing that the terrorists will not divide Britain but make it stronger

Armed: Military personnel in uniform stand guard at Woolwich Barracks yesterday, where security has been tightened

Insisting that the ban be rescinded, 
Mr Cameron told a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall:
‘The best way to defeat terrorism is for everyone – including our brave
service personnel – to go about their lives as normal.’

The dressing down was a blow for Mr Hammond, who is understood to have agreed that the uniform ban should be implemented.

Security had been tightened within 
hours of the attack amid fears that other military personnel could be 
targeted in ‘copycat’ strikes.

Instructions issued to commanders said
that troops should be ‘advised to maintain a low public profile until 
further information is received; uniforms should be concealed while in a
public place, particularly when travelling alone or from home to unit.

Defiant: Soldiers walk outside Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich Headquarters, close to the scene where a soldier was murdered in John Wilson Street

Floral tributes, and a T-shirt, have been left outside the Royal Military Barracks, near the scene where a solider was brutally murdered in broad daylight

‘Specifically in London District, 
uniform is not to be worn outside units or when travelling to and from 
units unless authorised at military one-star level or above.’

Boris
Johnson arrived at Downing Street for the Cobra meeting with a warning 
that the Woolwich knife attack must not be blamed on British foreign 
policy.

'It is completely 
wrong to blame this killing on the religion of Islam, but it is also 
equally wrong to try to draw any link between this murder and British 
foreign policy or the actions of British forces who are risking their 
lives abroad for the sake of freedom.

'The fault lies wholly and exclusively in the warped and deluded mindset of the people who did it.

'What we need now is, for the sake of the victim and the sake of his family, for those killers to be brought to justice.

'I think I want to pay particular tribute, not just to the work of the police and security services yesterday.

'But
also, above all, to the people of Woolwich, who showed such exemplary 
courage and bravery in a very difficult situation indeed.'

'The
people of London should take their cue, from the behaviour of the 
people of Woolwich yesterday, who showed such astonishing natural 
courage in dealing with an appalling event, and who stood up to these 
killers.

'I think that 
that’s the spirit of London, and that’s what I would call upon people to
do today: go about their lives in the normal way.'

But current and former servicemen 
defied the ruling by posting pictures online. Former soldier Glenn Rees,
of Maesteg in Wales, was among those who posted a picture of himself in
uniform.

He wrote on Facebook: ‘The 
Government’s decision to ban military personnel wearing uniform in 
public whilst investigations are being carried out is ridiculous! 
Backing down already!

‘Been out of the Forces for three 
years to the day … Least I could do for this innocent soldier and his 
family. Brothers Unite!!’

The heightened state of alert was a 
throwback to the 1970s and 1980s, when military personnel were ordered 
to wear civilian clothes on the streets because of the threat from the 
IRA.

In recent years, troops have been 
encouraged to wear their uniforms in public. But jihadist websites have 
urged Muslim extremists to target those in uniform as revenge for 
British forces fighting in Afghanistan.

Colonel Richard Kemp, a former 
commander in Afghanistan, said he opposed the restrictions, explaining: 
‘As we saw in this case you don’t need to have somebody in uniform, you 
just need to have someone who knows a bit about soldiers and does a bit 
of observation in the vicinity of a barracks and can identify a soldier 
very quickly.’

General Sir David Richards, the Chief of the Defence 
Staff, also lent his support to Mr Cameron’s decision.

He said he believed it was an 
‘isolated incident’, adding: ‘There is no reason at all why we should 
not wear our uniforms with pride, but on a common sense basis.’

Ann Annis, 49, whose 22-year-old son 
Simon died in a Taliban bomb blast in 2009, said: ‘It’s a sad reflection
of Britain when they’re being advised not to wear their uniforms but to
go out in civvies.

‘I don’t want them hurt, of course, 
but they should be allowed to wear their tunics with pride.

'The best way to defeat terrorism is for everyone – including our brave service personnel – to go about their lives as normal'

Prime Minister David Cameron

'It used to 
be that our soldiers in uniforms were applauded on the streets but now 
the country has become too lily-livered.’

Sources close to the Defence Secretary
said the ban was part of a raft of ‘immediate and automatic reactive 
security measures’ after the attack.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 
‘Following a review of the situation this morning, a decision has been 
taken to relax some of these temporary measures imposed yesterday.’

The Woolwich atrocity was an attack on the British way of life, David Cameron said yesterday.

But, speaking outside Downing Street after chairing the crisis committee Cobra, he insisted the outrage would serve to unite different communities.

‘What happened in Woolwich yesterday has sickened us all,’ said the Prime Minister. ‘The people who did this were trying to divide us. They should know something like this will only bring us together, make us stronger.’

Mr Cameron said the attack was a betrayal of Islam and ‘solely and purely’ the responsibility of the accused.

‘This view is shared by every community in our country,’ he added. ‘This was not just an attack on Britain and on the British way of life; it was also a betrayal of Islam and of the Muslim communities who give so much to our country. There is nothing in Islam that justifies this truly dreadful act.’

The Prime Minister said Britain would be resolute in its ‘stand against violent extremism’. ‘We will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms,’ he added.

‘We will defeat violent extremism by standing together, by backing our police and security services, and above all by challenging the poisonous narrative of extremism on which this violence feeds.

Britain works with our international partners to make the world safe from terrorism – terrorism that has taken more Muslim lives than any other religion. It is an utter perversion of the truth to pretend anything different.’

President Barack Obama said: ‘The United States stands resolute with the United Kingdom, our ally and friend, against violent extremism and terror.

‘There can be absolutely no justification for such acts, and our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim, the police and security services responding to this horrific act and the communities they serve, and the British people.’

Baroness Warsi, minister for faith and communities, said she had been ‘incredibly impressed’ by the way in which British Muslim communities had ‘unreservedly and unitedly condemned’ the barbaric acts.
