Royal baby fever may have gripped much of Britain and indeed the rest of the world, but as one American interviewer found out, not everyone is in a frenzy of anticipation.

When CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour asked Margaret Rhodes, the Queen's first cousin and close friend, if she was excited about the baby, her answer took the journalist by surprise.

'Not terribly,' admitted the 88-year-old, hooting with laughter.

British sangfroid: The Queen's first cousin, 88-year-old Margaret Rhodes, says she is 'not terribly' excited about the impending birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby

'Heir to the throne? History?' An incredulous Christiane Amanpour reacts to Mrs Rhodes' confession

Why on earth not? asked the incredulous Amanpour.

Mrs Rhodes, who grew up with the Queen 
and was present at the Queen Mother's deathbed in 2002, sighed: 'Well 
you know, everybody has babies.  And it's lovely.  But I don't get 
wildly excited about it.'

'Heir to the throne?' prompted Amanpour. 'History?'

Eventually, possibly more to move on to more interesting topics than anything else, Mrs Rhodes conceded: 'Yes, all right. I'm prepared to be excited.'

The US TV host  asked Mrs Rhodes, the youngest daughter of the 16th Lord Elphinstone and his wife Mary Bowes-Lyon, sister of the Queen Mother, what sort of life the baby, which will be third in line to the throne, would have.

Mrs Rhodes said she hoped it would have 'just a jolly, happy, ordinary child's
life', something she said the Royal Family managed with the then Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.

She added: 'The king and queen in those days made an 
enormous effort to give -- to keep their childhood sort of sacrosanct. I
mean, it was just a time for learning and enjoying.

'And I think that 
they have succeeded awfully well.'

Mrs Rhodes, who lived at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace during World War Two, while she worked for MI6, went on to staunchly defend the Queen over criticism about the way she reacted to Princess Diana's death in 1997, staying up in Balmoral rather than returning to the capital.

She said: 'I think it was an eminently sensible decision personally because what was the point -- we've got two grieving children with you, William and Harry, whose mother's just died unexpectedly.

'And to go to London and sit in Buckingham Palace with nothing to do, nothing to do except sit and think about your mother or look out of the window at the crowds, I mean, what help was that for the boys?'

Asked by the interviewer whether she talked to the monarch about the aftermath, mother-of-four Mrs Rhodes said: 'No. No. And I've 
never talked to her about it. I mean there are some things that one sort
of keeps off, really.

Margaret Elphinstone married the writer Denys Gravenor Rhodes in 1950 - Princess Margaret was bridesmaid

Mrs Rhodes, who lives in the Garden House in Windsor Great Park, given to her by the Queen 32 years ago, said the Queen often comes to have a drink with her after attending the chapel in the park.

She said: 'She quite often does. She comes in after prayers for 
half an hour and just has a nice little drink and a chat.

She also described how her cousin fell in love with her 'incredibly good-looking' future husband when she was just 13 and he 17, saying: 'I think that in the way 13-year olds do, she fell in love with a very, very handsome young man.'

Mrs Rhodes was a bridesmaid at their wedding in 1947, three years before her own wedding.

Mrs Rhodes admits that when she heard her aunt and uncle were to become the Queen and King of England, her reaction could have been more sophisticated.

She said: 'I can remember to this day that I 
shamingly hopped around the dance floor, saying, "My uncle's now king," 
which was a very shaming thing to do, but I did it.'

After the death of her husband, Denys Rhodes, Mrs Rhodes became a Woman of the Bedchamber to her aunt, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, a position she held until the latter's death.

She told Amanpour how she wept when watching the film, The King’s Speech, about her uncle, King George VI.

She said: 'I cried in the film, it was so well done. And I think it did show the difficulties he surmounted. And there was one moment where he was making the king say a whole lot of frightfully rude words...

'And I did say something to the Queen about that, and she said she'd never heard her father use bad language at all. So whether that was true or not, I don't know.'

Journalists are cursing the hot sun as they wait in soaring temperatures outside the hospital in the press pen

Mrs Rhodes, whose autobiography The Final Curtsey tells how she had to ensure the Queen Mother never ran out of gin and Dubonnet, champagne or chocolate eclairs, had some words of approbation for the Duchess of Cambridge, saying 'She's doing very, very well.'

She added: 'I think she's got a way with her 
that's going to be very appealing. And I think that she won't sort of 
vie for coverage with... which Diana perhaps did a little bit.'

After a fortnight spent waiting in the press pen outside St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, journalists are running out of ways to kill the time.

They grabbed their spot and marked it up two weeks ago, and now there is little to do but wait in the sunshine.

One US news anchor, NBC's Natalie Morales, has taken to knitting to pass the time outside the private Lindo wing where the Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth.

Morales, 41, a mother of two boys who in her spare time competes in triathlons, is knitting a pair of pale blue bootees for the baby.

If she has to wait much longer, she can knit a pink pair as well.
