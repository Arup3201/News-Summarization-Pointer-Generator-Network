Two people died and one was left fighting for his life today when a massive boulder 'the size of a car' crashed into their tourist train in the south of France.

The horrific accident happened as the so-called 'Train of the Pines' ran from Nice to the Alpine resort of Digne-les-Bain on Saturday morning.

Around 30 people were on board when a landslide dislodged the huge rock, causing it to roll down on to the train, denting one of the carriages and leaving hanging over the snow-capped mountain side.

'The boulder was the size of a car - it has caused enormous damage,' said Jean Ballester, mayor of nearby Annot.

He
 said that many of those on board were left trapped in the wreckage, 
while one man was seen being catapulted out of the mangled metal.Â 

A
 49-year-old Russian woman died, along with an 82-year-old Frenchman,

Operation: Emergency workers are seen at the site of the crash near Saint Benoit, Southern France

Shocking
 pictures posted on social media sites by Nice Matin newspaper show the 
two carriage train hanging from the snowy mountainside.

'One
 of the carriages is still on the track, the second is still on the 
slope,' said eye witness Quentin Bonnard. 'There are firefighters 
everywhere. It is very dramatic.'

The
 accident happened between Annot and St Benedit in the 
Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department of southern France - one which is 
full of British holidaymakers during the ski season.

A
 'red alert' emergency procedure was triggered by the local prefecture, 
with firefighters, ambulances and police all rushed to the scene.

Two helicopters are being used to try and get to the site of the accident, and to evacuate the injured.

The train, which was travelling from Nice, is popular with British holidaymakers

French Interior Minister said treacherous weather 'including heavy snowfall' was making the emergency operation difficult.

The
 Nice to Digne line is 93 miles long, and has been servicing tourists to
 France since 1891 as one of the famous 'Trains de Pignes'.

The
 train crosses some of the most beautiful countryside in Europe, 
including mountain gorges and viaducts. The line rises to a height over 
up to 1000 meters.
