More runways will have to be built in the South East of England if the UK is to avoid aviation gridlock, Britain’s airports tsar said yesterday.

Sir Howard Davies did not give a preferred option but the tone of his speech appeared to raise the odds of a highly controversial extra runway at Heathrow.

He did not even mention in his speech the so-called ‘Boris Island’ plans for a Thames Estuary airport championed by London Mayor Boris Johnson.

Sir Howard was detailing the provisional findings of his investigation into solving the problem of Britain’s bursting airport capacity.

He said simply expanding regional airports such as Birmingham and Manchester would not provide a solution.

Big issue: More runways will have to be built in the south-east of England, including potentially at Heathrow (pictured), Britain's airport tsar said today

Problem: Sir Howard Davies has said expanding regional airports such as Birmingham and Manchester would not solve the problem of aviation capacity

However, any recommendation of a third runway at Heathrow would trigger a huge political row.

The Conservatives are against it while Labour’s policy is confused.

Offically,
it is against major Heathrow expansion but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls 
said recently he would prefer a third runway over funding the High Speed
2 rail link.

Sir Howard
said: ‘Our provisional conclusion is that we will need some net 
additional runway capacity in the South East of England in the coming 
decades.’

He stressed 
that to rely ‘only on runways currently in operation’ would mean a 
poorer service for passengers and could damage the economy.

Sir
Howard, who chairs the Government’s Airports Commission, will deliver a
short-list of options at the end of the year, followed by a single 
recommendation to ministers in 2015.

He said the final recommendation could involve expansion at more than one airport – such as Heathrow and Gatwick or Stansted.

Despite
failing to mention the ‘Boris Island’ options in his speech, he 
insisted afterwards that the Thames Estuary plans were still on the 
table.

But he conceded that if it went ahead, the implication was that this would ‘certainly involve the closure of Heathrow’.

New favourite idea: Boris has backed the four-runway 'Foster Island' (pictured) in the Thames Estuary airport, which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers a year on the Isle of Grain in Kent

Elaborate plan: The Isle of Grain's proposed international railway station, which would include a service to Waterloo in 26 minutes

HEATHROW: Heathrow airport chiefs have published three options for a controversial new third runway to double 
passenger numbers and ‘win the race’ to be Europe’s main international 
airline hub. But they also spelled out the prospect of fourth runway 
built after 2040.

Residents reacted with fury to the blueprint that 
would mean a sixth terminal T6 at Heathrow, and a seventh likely to 
follow, threatening action in the High Court to halt it.

Each
of the three third-runway Heathrow options will boost annual flights 
from 480,000 to 740,000 a year  – more in keeping with its international
rivals - doubling passenger numbers from 70million to 130million a 
year.

'FOSTER ISLAND': The inner estuary site on Kent's Isle of Grain is close enough to London to provide smooth and fast access by public transport, yet ideally located so as to allow take-off and landing over water and so impact on as small a population as possible.

'BORIS ISLAND': An airport on an artificial island off the Kent coast would remove all problems of noise pollution and give the airport the freedom to operate in whatever way it needed in order to maximise the UK’s connectivity and economic benefits.

STANSTED EXPANSION: Developing a major four-runway airport at Stansted would have the attraction of building on existing infrastructure and being sited in a relatively sparsely populated region.

GATWICK EXPANSION: Rival Gatwick has unveiled its own 
controversial plans for a £9billion  second runway at Gatwick that could
treble passenger numbers to nearly 90million a year. But it too has 
flown into turbulence from residents and environmental groups. Gatwick 
bosses said a new runway in West Sussex, positioned to the south of the 
current site, could be open in 2025 and could almost treble passenger 
numbers but be less expensive and less noisy than an extra runway at 
Heathrow. It would be part of a ‘constellation’ of three main airports 
around London – instead of one major Heathrow ‘hub’.

Sir
Howard said: ‘It is obvious that options for Heathrow are on the table.
I don’t think that makes other options un-lookable at.’

But he added: ‘You also have to look at how the airline market would develop if you didn’t expand Heathrow.’

Sir Howard held back for now on ruling on his ‘preferred option’ for South East airport expansion.

Fighting
to win his support are plans for a third and even a  fourth runway at 
Heathrow, a brand new ‘Boris island’ in the Thames estuary – the two 
competing and opposing  ‘hub’ airport options -  and extra runways at 
Gatwick and Stansted.

Sir
Howard, who chairs the Government’s Airports Commission which will 
recommend to ministers where new runways should be built  was giving 
his  ‘emerging thinking’ in a speech after taking evidence from 
interested parties over the Summer.

He
added that in environmental terms  it ‘would also almost certainly not 
be the best solution in terms of minimising the overall carbon impact of
flights and travel to and from airports’. 

Sir
Howard said pressure on the UK’s busiest airports is likely to continue
to grow ‘even if we take a more conservative view of future aviation 
demand than the DfT has in the past.’

This will lead to overcrowding at airports in the south east of England specifically.

More importantly, this aviation gridlock will  happen even if demand for flights is less than expected because of pressures from the Government’s legally enforced ‘green’ climate change objectives.

Sir Howard said it was difficult to see how the market alone could resolve the ‘imbalance’ between demand and capacity in the South East of England.

And simply sending for flights to the regions would not be enough: ‘Regional airports are already serving their local markets effectively but it is difficult to see how they can absorb all the excess demand. The tools available to Government to influence the location of flights are also very limited.’

So taken together the taken together he concluded that such consideration ‘point to the need for new runway infrastructure in the south east of England in the coming decades’.

He added: ‘A mechanism for managing the carbon impacts of aviation will be needed if the UK is to achieve its statutory carbon targets – just as it will in other countries. This is the case whether new runway capacity is provided in the South East or not.’

He added: ‘I would be interested in comments on the analysis I have set out today.’

The Commission is seeking responses on the emerging thinking and analysis set out in the speech by  October 31.

The Airports Commission was launched in November last year but its final recommendations will not be implemented – if at all – until after the next General Election.
