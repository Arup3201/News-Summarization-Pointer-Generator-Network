A giant Banksy on the side of a crumbling Grade II listed building with an estimated value of £1million has been removed.

The giant rat, which was created by Britain's most famous street artist, has been eroding for years, with large parts having peeled off with the plaster or vanished on rotted wood.

But today a special restoration team were drafted in to remove the painting from the old Whitehorse pub in Liverpool's China town as part of plans to re-open the building.

Banksy has since conquered the art world, selling his unique pieces for millions, and counts Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie amongst his fans.

Britain's biggest Banksy, previously valued at £1million, adorned the pub and campaigns to restore the artwork, have led to its inclusion in plans to gain planning permission from Liverpool city council.

The repair follows similar initiatives in London, where Banksy art trails are a huge draw for tourists and special crack teams ensure his graffiti stays in top condition.

Urban art specialists Purple Revolver, who campaigned for the giant artwork to be rescued have praised the move.

Art director Amber Tan said: 'We have been calling for the preservation of this Banksy for a long time.

'It should be a massive tourist attraction, but it has been left to rot for years. As a graffiti artist, he has a mixed following - but love him or hate him Banksy is a big player in Britain's art scene and his place in history is ensured.

'We're not putting Banksy in the same category as the Beatles, but look what happened with The Cavern - Liverpool Council demolished it.

'In London, they have special teams, who travel round and keep their Banksy's protected from vandalism and erosion. Every city in Britain should be doing the same.

'This is the right move and we're pleased the city council and the building's new owners have recognised the painting's significance and worked it into restoration plans.'

Spokesman Stuart Howard said: 'We have removed the giant Banksy artwork from the former Whitehorse pub building.

'But we want to allay any fears that we have just thrown it out. We have been working closely with the city council and have drafted in a specialist restoration team.

'The artwork was in a fairly bad condition, most of the painting which was on wooden panels covering the buildings windows had fallen off as the wood had rotted.

'But we have been assured that it can be restored to its original condition and the pieces have been numbered and taken away to secure storage.

'It's full steam ahead for the renovation and we're confident it will be finished shortly and to everybody's satisfaction.'
