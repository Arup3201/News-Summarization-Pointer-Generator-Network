It was once a squat filled with cannabis-smoking hippies. But walking through the marble entrance hall, past limestone-lined suites and up the original stone staircase, it is hard to imagine that One Cornwall Terrace has ever been home to anyone short of cash.

On the market for £100 million, the property is the world’s most expensive terraced house.

Situated on the edge of Regent’s Park in Central London, it boasts seven bedrooms, 11 reception rooms, nine bathrooms, a private gym and a garage with number-plate recognition that can accommodate two limousines.

Outdoor opulence: One Cornwall Terrace's grand, sweeping staircases certainly give the garden, which occupies half an  acre, the appearance of an extravagant ballroom. The garden is also set below street level, making the space completely private

The Grade I listed building, whose lights are controlled by an iPad, also has a heated indoor swimming pool – set in Portland stone – complete with spa, sauna and his-and-hers changing rooms.

The dining room, which has been restored to its former Regency glory, seats 16, while there are two kitchens in an Upstairs, Downstairs-style arrangement.

The family kitchen has lantern-style windows, a Portland stone floor and heated window seats. The industrial-sized below-stairs kitchen, where most meals will be prepared, also includes a ‘wine cave’ and cold room.

Staff at the neoclassical house, which estate agent Savills describes as ‘one of the most important private residences in London’, have a suite of rooms next to the kitchen.

Set in half an acre, the Italianate gardens are below street level and completely private. Thanks to two sweeping staircases, the dramatically lit yard and gardens have the appearance of an external ballroom.

Designed and built in the 1820s by architect Decimus Burton, the construction of the whole of Cornwall Terrace was supervised by John Nash, who designed Buckingham Palace. It was named after King George IV, whose titles included the Duke of Cornwall.

The mansion is most famous for serving
 as the official London residence of the New Zealand High Commissioner 
from 1955 until the Seventies. The High

Commissioners,
 from Sir Thomas Clifton Webb onwards, hosted lavish parties where 
guests included celebrities, ambassadors and royalty.

But
 in January 1975, London was shocked when the building was hijacked by 
hippies, who broke in when the terrace was temporarily empty and turned 
it into a squat.

One Cornwall Terrace was transformed into a ‘temple’. Groups known as the Rainbow People and the Divine Light Mission spent hours meditating and opened a health-food shop on the premises. One squatter, known only as Katherine, recalled a man brewing beer in the kitchen. ‘Cornwall Terrace was a glamorous break from the dingy squats I was used to,’ she said. ‘There was a lot of people wandering in and out high all the time.’

After the squatters were evicted in the autumn of 1975, Cornwall Terrace was converted into the headquarters of property company British Land. In recent years, the house has changed hands several times. In 2002, it was registered to telecoms millionaire Charles Wigoder.

Nice views: The house looks over Regent's Park and is on the market for £100m which puts it out of the price range of even some of the most wealthy people in the country

Then in 2007, developer Oakmayne Properties bought Cornwall Terrace and gave the houses a makeover. Supervised by English Heritage and the Crown Estate, each home took 83,000 man hours to refurbish. If One Cornwall Terrace sells for the asking price, it will set the record for a terraced house.

‘The most likely buyer would be a businessman from Eastern Europe or Russia,’ said Gary Hersham of Beauchamp Estates.

‘The buyer is unlikely to be from the Middle East because, despite its superb interiors, One Cornwall Terrace does not have enough bedrooms.’

From the top to the bottom of the property ladder... This two-bedroom mid-terrace in Ferryhill, County Durham, was recently put up for auction with a starting price of just £2,500, making it one of the cheapest houses in Britain. The rundown house was described as an ‘investment property in need of full refurbishment’.
