MPs yesterday called for an urgent investigation into the Bank of England’s role in the financial meltdown of 2007 and 2008.

The institution’s governor, Sir Mervyn King, admitted this week that he should have done more ‘to prevent the disaster’ – the worst since the 1930s.

David Ruffley, a senior Tory MP who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said a probe could not ‘come soon enough’.

Sir Mervyn King said he was not 'scared' of an inquiry into the Bank of England taking place, telling the BBC he would be 'very happy' if it did

He added: ‘Hard-working families and the wider British economy will suffer for some years yet from the catastrophically poor judgment and buck-passing that preceded the banking crash.

‘Yet individuals who are suspected of being asleep on the job are to be given draconian and unprecedented powers this year.’

The Tory chairman of the committee, Andrew Tyrie, said: ‘The Bank is taking on considerable new powers in the Financial Services Bill, currently before Parliament.

‘Yet we still do not have firm and agreed conclusions about the mistakes that were made and which the legislation is, presumably, seeking to address.’

John Mann, a Labour member of the committee, called on Sir Mervyn to apologise for the Bank’s handling of the credit crunch.

‘There certainly should be an inquiry into the Bank’s mistakes and it is a shame that Sir Mervyn has rebuffed the proposal in the past,’ he added. ‘We need to know where the Bank failed, and why. We also need to look at his role, because he was a big part of the problem.’

In a BBC interview yesterday, Sir Mervyn was accused of being ‘scared’ of a large-scale inquiry into the Bank’s conduct before, during and after the crisis.

He brushed off the suggestion and insisted he would be ‘very happy’ if a probe took place. Sir Mervyn insisted however that the first and only inquiry by the Bank, in 2008, was sufficient. ‘The important thing is whether you learn the lessons. And we have done that,’ he added.

Treasury sources said George Osborne was ‘relaxed’ about the prospects of an inquiry but that it was a ‘matter for the Bank’.

Both the Treasury Select Committee and the FSA have conducted major inquiries without apportioning blame.

The FSA’s inquiry into the cataclysmic collapse of Royal Bank of Scotland sparked outrage because its former boss, Fred Goodwin, escaped any sanction.

Despite his pivotal role in its collapse, Mr Goodwin has been rewarded with a £342,500-a-year pension.

Sir Mervyn caused controversy yesterday by saying the Coalition had given a ‘textbook response’ to the economic crisis.

Other MPs have said people should know 'where the Bank failed and why'

He said the balance struck between spending cuts and deficit reduction was ‘perfectly sensible’ and only soaring inflation had prevented a return to growth.

His comments enraged Labour because the governor is supposed to be politically neutral, especially on a polling day.

Andy Love, a Labour member of the Commons Treasury committee, said: ‘This is a very unwise intervention by the governor. He has been less than forthcoming about the Bank of England’s mistakes.’

Sir Mervyn also claimed banks were able to get away with awarding excessive bonuses because taxpayers’ cash guarantees they cannot go under.
