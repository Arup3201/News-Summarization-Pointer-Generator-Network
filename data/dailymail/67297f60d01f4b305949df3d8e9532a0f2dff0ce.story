Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney will hope his side are at top gear at Anfield on Sunday, as he headed into training in his new BMW i8 hybrid sports car.

The 29-year-old showed off his new wheels at Carrington as Manchester United prepare to take on Liverpool in a crucial clash in pursuit of Champions League qualification.

Liverpool are only two points behind Louis van Gaal’s side, who are occupying the fourth qualifying position, but Brendan Rodgers’ side haven’t lost in the Premier League since losing 3-0 at Old Trafford in December.

Rooney has splashed out £104,590 on his new BMW i8 having scored five goals in his last six Manchester United appearances.

The new hybrid from BMW uses the combination of an electric motor and a powerful petrol engine which provide extremely low emissions into the environment.

Rooney will certainly be quick into training as the sports car can accelerate from 0-62mph in just 4.4 seconds, and has a top speed limited to 155mph.

Perhaps the United captain splashed out on a new motor as a celebration for his return to form.

Van Gaal has utilised the England captain as a forward again recently and the results are proving worthwhile as Manchester United crushed Tottenham 3-0 at Old Trafford last weekend.

United fans will hope Rooney is up to speed for the trip to Anfield as van Gaal’s side looks to consolidate a position in the Premier League's prestigious top four ahead of their fierce rivals.
