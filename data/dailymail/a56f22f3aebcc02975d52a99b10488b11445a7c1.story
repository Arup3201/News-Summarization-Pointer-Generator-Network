A young athlete who dreamed of playing college basketball will get her chance to start in her first game - even though she has an inoperable brain tumor and just weeks to live.

Lauren Hill, 19, of Lawrenceburg, Indiana, was a standout high school player who committed to playing at Mount St. Joseph’s University, also in Indiana, in October of last year.

Then, last November, she found out she had an inoperable brain tumor.

Hoop dreams: Lauren Hill (center in uniform) has an inoperable brain tumor and just weeks to live, but will get to play her first college basketball game at Mount St. Joseph's on November 1

Inspiration: The teenager, who was a high school standout (left) and prom queen (right) has stayed positive despite her diagnosis

While doctors at first gave the teenager two years to live, a recent MRI showed that her tumor had grown, and she now just has weeks left.

Not that even that was enough to stop Hill, who has Diffused Intrinsic Pentene Gleoma, a cancer with roots at the base of her brain stem with growing tentacles weaving through her nerves. 

'I never gave up for a second even when I got a terminal diagnosis; never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,' she told Local 12.

And now she will be getting to fulfill her dream of playing college ball, thanks to some help from her school and the NCAA.

During her surprise birthday party on October 1, exactly one year from the date she signed to play at Mt. Saint Joseph's, Hill learned that the school contacted the NCAA who agreed to move up their opening game against Hiram College from November 15 to November 1 so she can take the court.

It will be her first, and last, time playing college basketball. 

Hope: Instead of being scared of death, Hill (above with mother Lisa) says she is just excited about getting to play basketball for her team just once

Mount Saint Joe's basketball coach, Dan Benjamin, said, 'She's a special person. This girl is so strong, she's dealing with death and all she's thinking about is everyone else. 

Her team first her family first, and just to give her that one last wish would be incredible for our program and our players.' 

As for Hill, those few weeks she has left won't be filled with fear or tears it seems, but rather excitement and hope.

Said the teenager, 'I love the roar of the crowd, the squeaking of the shoes. I can't wait to be on this court and wearing #22.'
