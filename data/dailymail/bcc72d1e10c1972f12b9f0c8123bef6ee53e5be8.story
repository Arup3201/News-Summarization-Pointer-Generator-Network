Ordeal: The Redgraves were mugged in Rio de Janeiro

Olympic rowing hero Sir Steve Redgrave has been robbed on a beach in Rio de Janeiro – the Brazilian city that will host the  2016 games.

Five-time gold Olympic medallist Sir Steve, 50,  and wife Lady Ann, 53, were walking on Ipanema beach last week when they were confronted by a mugger who demanded their watches and money.

A source told The Mail on Sunday the couple reported the incident to local police and that they were ‘shaken but not injured’.

Last night Sir Steve – who is the most successful male rower in Olympic history – confirmed the incident had taken place but declined to comment further.

However, the attack is an embarrassing blow for Brazil’s Olympic organisers – who are keen to promote Rio’s improved safety record and dispel fears over crime.

Sir Steve and Lady Ann, a fellow rower who represented Britain in the women’s eight at the LA Olympics in 1984, flew to Brazil two weeks ago.

He was there to attend the Laureus World Sport Awards – dubbed the Oscars of the sporting world – but also visited Rio’s Lake Lagoa, the rowing venue for the 2016 Olympics.

After the visit, Sir Steve spoke of his excitement at the spectacular venue, located in the shadow of Rio’s iconic Corcovado mountain.

He said: ‘It’s a marvellous setting,  absolutely stunning. In our sport we normally compete outside the city.

‘We never get to compete in the heart 
of a city, but here in Rio we have got that chance. We will be very much
in the middle of it, with the Jesus Christ statue looking over the 
rowers.’

Sir Steve and his wife, who now acts as the British rowing 
team’s medical officer, flew home last week.

The attack is not the first time Sir 
Steve, who won gold medals at five successive Games between 1984 and 
2000, has been the victim of crime.

In 2007 his home in Marlow, 
Buckinghamshire, was burgled with thieves stealing three BBC Sports 
Personality Of The Year awards and a string of other belongings.

After the break-in he said he was  ‘devastated’ that several personal items had been taken.
