Poignant letters and diaries written by soldiers on the frontline will be among the 'treasures' on display after a £23.25million redevelopment of one of Britain's best-loved attractions.

Freshly-discovered documents which have lain unseen for centuries will feature in one of the new galleries at the National Army Museum.

It will showcase handwritten notes, postcards, photographs and diaries - both endearing and heartbreaking - from troops risking life and limb in conflicts during the 400-year history of the British Army, right up to the present day war in Afghanistan.

This board was made from the uniforms of British soldiers and the pieces from bone. It was sewn by soldiers during the Crimean War and is a surprising example of what soldiers do to occupy their time whilst on campaign

Historic military artefacts, uniforms and weapons are also expected to be used to shed fresh light on the life and work of soldiers.

The museum in Chelsea, south-west London, is planning five permanent galleries to focus on the British Army, highlighting its multi-cultural history and what it felt like to be a serviceman. 

A museum spokesman said: 'Soldiers sit at the very heart of the story. The "Soldier" gallery will explore the lives of troops as individuals – utterly human, capable of courage and cowardice, virtue and vice.

'It will highlight the career paths of soldiers in a range of Army roles over five centuries, following their journey through enlistment, training, daily life, combat and beyond.

'Using personal testimonies and unique written records from the museum's archives, the gallery will examine the similarities and differences of soldiering through time, right up to the conflict in Afghanistan.'

The project will also highlight the contributions of soldiers from across the Commonwealth.

The 'Battle' gallery will explore the most challenging test for the Army: armed combat on the frontline.Using examples from the Napoleonic Wars, the Charge of the Light Brigade and the First and Second World Wars, it will look at how warfare has changed over time, including shifts in tactics, technology and equipment.

This balancing monkey-on-a-stool toy was carved by Lieutenant Walter White while he was a prisoner-of-war in Valenciennes during the Napoleonic Wars in 1811. The subject matter is certainly not out of place in a modern context and demonstrates hobbies and skills of soldiers that one might not expect

Museum bosses hope to revolutionise the experience for visitors by providing improved exhibition spaces, learning areas for school trips, a research centre and a new cafe and shop.

Since opening in Chelsea in 1970 the museum's popularity has grown. It now receives more than 250,000 visitors per year.

Work on the redevelopment is hoped to begin later this year. The museum is currently awaiting planning permission and has applied for £11.5million from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

William Henry Clinton was the son of Henry Clinton, second in command of the British forces during the American Revolutionary War. These playing cards belonged to the family

Unseen exhibits being considered for the new galleries include a parachute smock belonging to Sergeant Peter Thorpe who was killed in a rocket attack by Taliban militants in July 2006.

The 27-year-old, of the Royal Corps of Signals, died when a defensive position at a base in Sangin was struck by enemy fire.

He had joined the Army at the age of 16 and trained as a boy soldier at the Army Apprentice College in Harrogate.

His smock and story will be included among objects relating to soldiers who have been killed on service dating back to the early years of the Army’s history.

The displays will also feature a balancing monkey-on-a-stool wooden toy carved by Lieutenant Walter White whilst he was a prisoner-of-war in Valenciennes during the Napoleonic Wars in 1811.

The carving demonstrates hobbies and skills of soldiers to pass the time. Lt White’s experience is made more relevant by letters with his parents in which he requests more money to be sent to him.

And a pack of playing cards owned by Major General William Henry Clinton, dating to 1810, illustrates how family traditions have always motivated people to join the Army.

William was the son of Henry Clinton, second in command of the British forces during the American Revolutionary War. His brother also served with the Army as did his two sons.

The playing cards will be displayed alongside other personal objects relating to the family.
