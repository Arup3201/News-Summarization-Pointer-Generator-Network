Russian smugglers came up with an original way to bring cigarettes into the West by hiding thousands of them inside hollowed out tree trunks.

The cigarettes had been manufactured in Belarus and were heading to the address of a private company in Poland from where they were supposed to be shipped on to Germany and the UK.

But they were stopped by the Ukrainian custom officers at the Yagodyn checkpoint located on the Ukrainian side of Ukrainian-Polish border.

Fifty-five of the trunks had been hollowed out and their ends replaced to carry the massive illicit load

Border guard spokesman Arkhip Glazkov said: 'As a result of a random check we discovered one of the trunks appeared to have been tampered with, and after looking more closely it was found that the tree trunk and been hollowed out and packed with cigarettes, and then the end of the trunk had been replaced to cover up the crime.

'In fact it was almost impossible to see the difference, but officers noticed that some of the logs seemed incredibly light compared to the others, and it was then that they discovered the fraud.'

In total they recovered 25,000 packets of cigarettes hidden inside 27 tons of timber where 55 of the tree trunks turned out to have been tampered with.

The find came just days after a hapless smuggler was caught trying to sneak an incredible 146 iPhones through Chinese customs by strapping them to his body. 

Chan Shih, 30, was found with 126 phones taped around his waist and another 20 around his legs after officers spotted him walking strangely. 

The 25,000 packets of cigarettes were bound for Germany and then the UK before they were intercepted

Border guard spokesman Arkhip Glazkov said: 'As a result of a random check we discovered one of the trunks appeared to have been tampered with'

Twenty-seven tons of timber had been tampered with in the audacious attempted smuggling operation

He had been travelling from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland via the Louhu checkpoint in Shenzhen, reported People's Daily Online. 

A customs spokesman said: 'This is the fifth time he has been caught smuggling since 2011.

'In total he has tried to bring in 511 iPhones and 127 CPUs, all of which he strapped to parts of his body.

'He needs to think of a new way of doing it as it is getting a bit obvious.' The man was arrested and is now awaiting trial.

Meanwhile two men have been jailed for smuggling 28 tonnes of cannabis into the UK - enough to get every person in the country stoned.

Steven McDonald, 32, and John Wright, 66, were part of a crime network that trafficked drugs from the Netherlands on an 'industrial scale'.

The cannabis they imported as part of the seven-year conspiracy would have had a street value in excess of £80million.

At Luton Crown Court on Friday Wright was sentenced to nine years and four months in prison and McDonald was handed an eight-year sentence.

The haul was recovered the other side of the country from the war-torn east. A February cease-fire in Ukraine's continuing civil war between government and rebel forces has eased hostilities
