According to the restaurant's website, 'the walls and ceilings are masoned with 150,000 antique style bricks. Its flooring is of granite quarried in the mountains of India. 

'Furniture and fixtures were all custom crafted to create unique and comfortable cavern echoing the underground architecture of ancient Rome.'
