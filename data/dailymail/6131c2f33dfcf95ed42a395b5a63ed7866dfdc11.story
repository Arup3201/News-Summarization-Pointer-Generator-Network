Terrifying: The shocking moment that robber Paul Ward, 26, threatened 18-year-old Chloe Gregory by forcing her to withdraw £100 from her bank account as he held a six-inch kitchen knife

The court was told he had armed himself with a black-handled knife with a six-inch serrated blade before carrying out the robbery.

Ward, who admitted robbery and possessing a kitchen knife, was said to be sorry for what he had done. His defence barrister said it would be an injustice if he was not jailed for the crime.

But Miss Gregory's family left court in anger after Ward was jailed for just 30 months.

Her family said: 'What about how Chloe 
feels? It was all about him. We would have been satisfied if he had got 
four years.'

Exeter Crown Court heard that Chloe Gregory was spending a Friday night with friends when her mother asked her to withdraw some cash.

Prosecutor Gordon Richings said the 
teenager, who was alone, was checking her account 
balance at the bank's ATM when she was suddenly approached by Ward.

Miss Gregory, from South Molton, Devon, begged the hooded knifeman not to hurt her as she withdrew the money from the Lloyds TSB cashpoint

Mr Richings said the defendant was wearing a dark raincoat with the hood up and a scarf hiding his nose and mouth as 'a disguise'.

He said: 'Chloe Gregory says she was pressing the balance to see how much she had in her account when she felt a light tap on her left shoulder. 

Ward, who was jailed for 30 months, was said to have walked four miles to South Molton, in desperation for money to buy drugs

'She turned around and Ward said 'I need £100'.'

Mr Richings said Miss Gregory noticed the blade in the robber's right hand.

He said: 'She said 'please don't hurt me' and he put the knife away.'

Frightened Miss Gregory withdrew the £100 in cash and gave the money to Ward.

Afterwards, Ward told Miss Gregory not to 'tell anyone or ring anyone'. He also ordered the teenager not to leave for two minutes until after he had left.

Miss Gregory said the incident had left her feeling 'scared and upset'.

She can no longer go out alone and fears bumping into Ward again, the court was told.

Defence barrister Sean Brunton said Ward wanted to make a 'complete and utterly unreserved apology' to the teenager.

He said: 'In his words he must be punished severely and if he is not sent to custody Miss Gregory would have been short changed.

'He looks like a boy and this was an aberration.

'He had walked four miles to South Molton that evening out of desperation to get money for drugs. Young Chloe was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

'He followed her into a cash ATM atrium and he saw she had £300 on her balance and he asked for £100 and then puts the knife away. He was not brandishing the knife of threatening her, although it was exceedingly frightening for her.'

Mr Brunton said Ward was a 'bright boy' who messed up his GCSEs when he was 16 and has been drifting for the last ten years and hooked on drugs.

The defendant, who had been remanded in custody for the last two months, said being jailed was 'the best thing that had happened to him' as he was clean, getting an education and feeling fitter.

Describing the incident, Mr Brunton said: 'Thank God it did not go any further that that. The defendant is the author of his own misfortune.'

But he accepted that the robbery had caused 'utter horror to the young girl minding her own business'.

Judge Phillip Wassall said noone expected something like that to happen in nice area such as South Molton.

He said he did not agree with the defence's suggestion that the robbery was unplanned, but he did believe it was 'opportunistic'.

Detective Constable Daryl Marvelly, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: 'Although she was unharmed she was clearly shaken up by this distressing incident.'

Exeter Crown Court heard that Miss Gregory had been badly affected by the incident. She was said to be scared to go out alone incase Ward recognises her
