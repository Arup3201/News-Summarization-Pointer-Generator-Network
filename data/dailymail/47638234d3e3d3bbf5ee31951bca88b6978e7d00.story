A Premier League footballer has been filmed inhaling potentially deadly laughing gas behind the wheel of his car, before allegedly driving 120 miles.

West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino, 20, can be seen inhaling nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas or 'hippy crack', from a purple balloon while sitting in his Range Rover.

It is thought the footage was taken in Birmingham city centre, just before Berahino reportedly drove 120 miles to London to carry on partying.

West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino, 20, has been filmed inhaling a nitrous oxide balloon in his car before reportedly driving 120 miles to London in order to continue partying

In the short clips, Berahino can be seen breathing from the balloon while staring wild-eyed into the camera. A giggling girl asks him 'are you f*****?' before questioning whether he has 'had enough'.

Berahino has today issued an apology for his behaviour and his club say he will be reprimanded for his actions

The drug is legal in the UK but several young people have died from taking it as it can cause asphyxiation, heart attacks and brain damage.

The £12,000-a-week player was filmed taking the drug just hours after the team lost 3-0 to Manchester United.

Berahino was partying at trendy Nuvo bar in Birmingham city centre on March 8 when the video was taken, according to the Sunday Mirror.

In a statement, Berahino said: ‘This was very poor judgement on my part and not the right example to be setting. At the time, I wasn’t fully aware of the serious health risks involved but now I know, I won’t be doing it again.’

Richard Garlick, the club’s sporting and technical Director, added: ‘I have spoken to Saido about the incident and told him in no uncertain terms that his conduct is not befitting a West Bromwich Albion player.

'Saido knows he has made a mistake. He has apologised for his actions and has assured the club it will not happen again.’

It comes just weeks after Berahino was involved in a dressing room bust up with team-mate James Morrison in the wake of the club's 3-3 draw against Cardiff.

Danny Lee-Frost, of the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, has said: ‘The rush users experience is caused by starving the brain of oxygen. The long-term dangers to health include bone marrow suppression, blood cell problems and poisoning of the central nervous system.’

Berahino, who earns £12,000-a-week, was filmed taking the drug after West Brom lost 3-0 to Manchester United

Drug advice website Frank warns: 'There is a risk of death as a lack of oxygen can occur when using nitrous oxide.

'This risk is likely to be greater if the gas is consumed in an enclosed space or if a substantial amount is rapidly used.'

Albion manager Pepe Mel has previously described England under-12 player Berahino as 'more responsible than other people of his age' and 'intelligent'.
