Cash-strapped town halls have hired temporary workers on deals worth more than £180,000-a-year.

Senior stand-ins at councils in Basildon, Southend and Essex County Council are being paid up to £800-a-day, costing £8million-a-year.

Critics rounded on the ‘enormous waste of money’ and claimed dozens of lower-paid jobs could have been saved instead. Some temporary staff have been in post for more than 18 months.

Temporary workers at Essex County Council employed 162 interim staff costing £7.2million, including two temps paid more than £900-a-day

At Basildon Council, one executive director who remains in a job is paid £565-a-day and was among seven other staff who earned more than £300 a day. They were all hired through agencies.

One interim executive director has been in post since August 2011 and is not due to leave until April 2013.

In total, Basildon Council spent £501,000
on temporary staff in 2011-12, while Southend's seven temporary 
employees cost a total of £330,000.

Mike Boyle, Southend council's interim head of adult commissioning, was paid £779 a day.

Mr Boyle, who did not receive sick pay or holidays, was one of six temps at the authority who earned more than £300 a day in 2011-12.

Essex County Council, which has cut almost 1,000 workers since 2009, employed 162 interim staff costing £7.2million.  Two of the temps were paid more than £900-a-day.

Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers Alliance said the fees for temps was an 'enormous waste of money'

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayer's Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be shocked that local authorities in the county are spending so much money on interim staff.

‘Temporary staff may be needed sometimes to fill roles in the short term, but these figures suggest they are being used for far longer than that by local authorities which is an enormous waste of money.

‘Councils need to explain why these staff were needed or to take action to deliver better value for our money.’

The local authorities insisted temporary staff are needed to cover sickness and vacancies in the short-term.

But Claire Wymald, Unison branch secretary for Southend, said: ‘It is a concern for us that this work has been carried out through temporary staff when it could have been done through normal staff.

‘There could have been quite a few jobs that could have been saved if the council had not been expending on these interim posts.

‘There isn't really any evidence on the contrary that this benefits the council long term, so why don't they retain staff instead?’

A Basildon Council spokesman said: ‘We employ over 1,000 staff, the vast majority of whom are contracted on either fixed term or permanent contracts.

‘However it is sometimes necessary to employ a small number of interim staff to fill critical posts that require staffing immediately whilst a recruitment process is undertaken, to fill posts that are hard to recruit to, or to manage planned absences.

‘We currently only have four interim positions, and it must be remembered that these posts would still incur a cost to the council if they were covered by contracted staff.’

Basildon, Southend and Essex County Council are being paid up to £800-a-day, costing £8million-a-year

Both Basildon and Southend Councils said that short-term staff do not get sick pay or paid leave.

Southend Council’s Sue Goodwin said: ‘We use interim managers for a range of purposes across the council but we do try to use them sparingly.

‘Interims are only commissioned to provide essential specialist advice and support if the council does not have the expertise in-house.

‘The council has been working proactively to manage its use of interims and over recent years we have used a very limited number of interim managers, primarily to cover for vacancies in critical posts or where we have gone through significant change.’

Essex County Council said temps helped with the council's cost cutting programme.

A said: ‘ECC has completed the first part of an ambitious programme of transformation, we have saved £360m as a result.

‘This has meant we have needed additional professional expertise and capacity in the short term in order to achieve this.

‘Interim staff can be a cost-effective way of accessing professional expertise in relation to short-term or one-off pieces of work and helps the council complete complex projects for which we have no or insufficient in-house capacity or capability.

‘Rigorous controls are in place around the recruitment of these staff, who are recruited for short periods of time in the main for less than three months.’
