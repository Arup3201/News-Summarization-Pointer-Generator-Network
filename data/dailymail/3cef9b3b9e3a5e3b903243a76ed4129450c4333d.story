A 19-year-old man had to be rescued this afternoon after he plunged through thin ice while playing hockey on a frozen pond in Massachusetts.

First responders from the Hanover Fire Department got a call at around noon about a young man submerged in frigid water in the middle of Forge Pond.

Minutes later, firefighters in orange cold-water suits arrived on the scene armed with an ice sled and quickly pulled the teenager to safety. 

Race against time:  It took Hanover firefighters nine minutes to rescue a 19-year-old boy whole fell through the ice on Forge Pond during a hockey game 

Dangerous move: The teen said he ventured out to the center of the pond to retrieve his glove, and suddenly the ice beneath his feet cracked 

The 19-year-old was conscious and responsive during the rescue, but hypothermic and weak after spending nine minutes in the water.

According to officials, the boy used his hockey stick to keep himself from going under, reported the station WBZ. 

After being pulled ashore by firefighters, the teen explained that he ventured out to the center of the pond, some 150 feet from shore, to retrieve his glove while playing hockey with a friend.

When the thin ice cracked under the boy's feet and he fell into the water, his companion called 911 and Hanover's fire chief was the first to arrive on the scene.

A day before the rescue, the Hanover FD tweeted a photo of firefighters in cold-water suits getting training in ice rescue techniques.

On Wednesday, the fire department sent out several tweets reminding people about the dangers of thin ice.

Quick thinking: The teen used his hockey stick to prop himself up while awaiting rescue 

Daved: The 19-year-old was conscious and responsive during the rescue, but hypothermic and weak after the harrowing ordeal

'Only Safe Ice is at your local skating rink!' read one of the messages.

Despite the warnings, later in the afternoon on Wednesday firefighters returned to Forge Pond after a group of people were spotted playing hockey on the ice.

The 19-year-old was taken to South Shore Hospital to be treated for hypothermia. There is no word at this time on his condition.
