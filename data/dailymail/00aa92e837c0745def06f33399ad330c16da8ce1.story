Forget tape measures, thimbles and plastic combs, these £4million Christmas crackers contain the ultimate in expensive gifts, from a trip around the world and an Aston Martin to even a yacht.

The festive crackers are being sold by luxury site VeryFirstTo, with the lucky winner receiving a white gold 'Diamants Legers' Cartier necklace set with 20 diamonds.

Other gifts include a Breguet Tradition, 18-carat rose gold watch, and the Faber-Castell limited-edition pen of the year - which costs £6,500.

What a cracker! The winner of the £4m crackers will find the keys to an Aston Martin inside one of them

Very First To has designed six Christmas crackers which include gifts to a staggering 4million

Gifts inside the crackers include a £19,000 Breguet Tradition Watch, left, and a Cartier necklace worth £18,600

Here's what you could win inside the Christmas crackers:  

Aston Martin Vanquish Coupe £190,000 

Breguet Tradition Watch £19,000 

Cartier Diamond Necklace £18,600 

Graf Von Faber-Castell £6,500 

1 Like No Other Trip £77,500 

Sunseeker Yacht £3,700,000 

Also up for grabs in the crackers is a £77,500 luxury trip around the world stopping off at 10 locations including Japan and Finland.

And you won't be short on outfits for the journey, as the winner will also receive a luxury shirt from 1 Like No Other in each location.  

Cracker pullers may even manage to get their hands on the keys to a top-of-the-range £190,000 Aston Martin Vanquish Coupe - much better than an old paper hat.

The most expensive item that guests will be gunning for is the Predator 84 yacht from Sunseeker. 

Fancy yourself as a bit of a sun seeker on this £3,700,000 yacht, the perfect way to celebrate Christmas 

Of course, it would be pretty difficult to fit a yacht inside a paper tube, so whoever wins will find a key fob inside.

The set of six extravagant bespoke crackers costs £4,018,600 in total. 

Designed by Simply Crackers, they can be tailored to suit the table décor of the buyer.

You can also change the gifts depending on your desires. 

The Graf Von Faber-Castell is a pretty expensive pen but coming in at £6,500 it's the cheapest gift in the set

However, if you want to substitute any of the prizes, you must find an alternative with a minimum value of £10,000.

And for every set of the crackers sold a donation of £1000 is made to the Prince's Trust. 

Amar Thapen, from VeryFirstTo, said: 'There are no jokes inside these crackers - just the ultimate in luxury presents.

'There is a present for every luxury connoisseur from diamonds to cars, horology and one of the finest writing instruments, not to mention a once in a lifetime trip like no other.'
