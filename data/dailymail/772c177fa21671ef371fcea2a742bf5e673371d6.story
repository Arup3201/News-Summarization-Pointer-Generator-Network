An Italian photographer has paid homage to Agnolo Bronzino, one of Italy's most treasured painters, with a new portrait series.

Christian Tagliavini, a Photoshop whizz, blends fine art and modern graphics for his unique, contemporary antique series called 1503.

The year 1503 is the birth year of Bronzino, an Italian court painter for the Medici family of Florence, and Tagliavini's images evoke his realistic style in an exaggerated, captivating way.

1503, Donna Clotilde (l) and a portrait of  Italian poet Laura Battiferri (1523-89), wife of Bartolomeo Ammannati, reading the sonnets of Petrarch (Francesco Petrarca), painted by Bronzino

Portrait of Cosimo de Medici (Cosimo the Elder, Cosimo di Giovanni de' Medici) (1389-1464) ) by Bronzino

His subjects are almost caricatures - swan-length necks, glowing, dewy complexions and looks that could kill - all influenced by Bronzino's signature style but multiplied by ten.

Bronzino's realistic paintings had an enormous influence on portraiture style across the art world. 

And Tagliavini, 42, of Swiss-Italian parentage, has taken the notion of the historical oil painting and translated it through new technology, dressing his subjects in haute-couture versions of Renaissance threads.

His images are washed in modern, steely neutral tones, moving away from regal  jewel colours popular among high society of the 1500s.

Born in 1971, Tagliavini was educated in Italy and Switzerland, where he lives and works as a photographer.

This provides him the perfect frame and background to invent, create and totally produce images that blend fine arts and craftsmanship.

He 'loves designing stories with open endings' (requiring observer’s complicity) on unexplored themes or unusual concepts, featuring uncommon people with their lives and their thoughts made visible. This rich and exciting collision of circumstances results in photos as a final product. 

He tells Beautiful Decay: 'I'm fascinated by the fact that I don't simply release the shutter, but that the real fun for me is before I take the pictures. 

'I say that I'm not really a photographer, but a workman of photography.'
