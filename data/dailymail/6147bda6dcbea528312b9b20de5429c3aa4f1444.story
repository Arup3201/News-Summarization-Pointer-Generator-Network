A Massachusetts couple aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise last month wanted to fall asleep to sounds of the ocean – instead, they were woken by desperate cries for help.

Roy Nagy’s wife Karen awoke at 4am and asked him to open the window so she could hear the ocean. Cries for help from outside led to a phone call, the ship was turned around and three men aboard a sinking motorboat were rescued an hour later.

‘We started to go back to sleep, and right after that, we started to hear voices out in the water,’ Mr Nagy told CBS Boston. ‘We heard, ‘Hey, hey, hey, hey.’

Unable to see anyone in the dark of night, the couple was sure they heard the voices – which were fading deeper and deeper into the dark as the ship traveled on.

Thinking people had fallen overboard, Mr Nagy told Nashoba Publishing, he called the ship’s crew to inform them people were in the water.

Two other couples also reported hearing people screaming for help outside the ship, according to CBS Boston. 

The captain soon turned around his ship, the Jewel of the Seas, switched on the flood lights and all hands on deck began an exhaustive search that lasted roughly an hour.

‘They shined a spotlight in the water, and we could see a person waving his arms frantically, so we were thrilled that somebody was going to be rescued,’ Mr Nagy, the executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Billerica (MA), told Nashoba.

As the ship inched closer to the marooned men and a rescue boat was deployed, Mr Nagy had goosebumps, he told CBS Boston.

‘They were without food, water and floating without life jackets for hours, so they were in real tough shape,’ he added.

The three men were Americans in a speedboat that had been headed from St Thomas to St Croix, in the Virgin Islands, according to Nashoba.

They had been in the water for 10 hours, but were soon posing for pictures with their rescuers, Nagys included.

The ship’s crew fed them, gave them water and a medical checkup. Dropped off only a few hours later, the trio was off the ship almost as quickly as they had come aboard.

‘I never saw them again, never even getting their names,’ Nagy told Nashoba. ‘It was such a blur, but no way I'll ever forget it. Just an off-the-charts experience.’

The Nagys received the royal treatment for the rest of their cruise, Roy told Nashoba.

The captain invited the couple to the bridge, sharing tales of past rescues and saying the rescued men would have died if the call had not been made.

Crew members showered them with endless bottles of wine and chocolates, fellow passengers asked them to recount the tale, everyone wanted to know their story, Mr Nagy said.

‘We wanted to go away and relax, but it kept coming up,’ Nagy added. ‘I feel the emotions every time I tell the story. It just gives me goosebumps every time.’

Reached by CBS Boston, one of the survivors was grateful for his rescue.

‘There’s really a lot of nice and beautiful people in the world,’ Matthew Spencer told the station.

A Royal Caribbean spokesperson said in a statement that the cruise operator was glad to be in the right place at the right time.
