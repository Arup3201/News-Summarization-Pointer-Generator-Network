Clive Palmer is at the centre of an unfair dismissal claim after one of his former employees alleged the politician referred to him as a 'fat ****' before demanding he be sacked.

Peter Yates, a former assistance food and beverage manager at Palmer Coolum Resort in Queensland, lodged a claim with the Fair Work Commission against Mr Palmer after he was fired in June.

Mr Yates, who had been employed by the resort for about 16 years, said the billionaire had pointed him out to other staff members and saying 'I want him gone', the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

When Mr Palmer was asked to clarify who he was talking about, Mr Yates claims he stated: 'the one on the forklift. The fat ****'.

Only ten minutes later, the resort's general manager Simon Stodard, phoned Mr Yates to inform him of his immediate dismissal.

He says he is yet to receive either a formal letter of resignation or any reason behind his dismissal.

Mr Yates also says he has not been paid out for his annual or long service leave, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Mr Yates alleges the billionaire ordered his dismissal without reason and called him a 'fat c***'  

When questioned by Daily Mail Australia about the incident, Mr Palmer denied having any knowledge of the sacking.

'He's the one who handles that not me,' Mr Palmer said of Mr Stodard.

'I'm not in business anymore I don't employ anybody.

'I don't know what his allegations are – I'm not really concerned about them but Mr Stodard handles my businesses. I don't work at the resort or have anything to do with it.'
