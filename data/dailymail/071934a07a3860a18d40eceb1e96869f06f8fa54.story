The number of people in work in Britain has increased by more than the rest of the EU put together.

Since 2010, an extra 1.6million people have found a job, while across the rest of Europe total employment has fallen by 1.08million.

David Cameron revealed the extraordinary statistic during a meeting with Tory MPs as he set out how the economic revival will be central to his hopes of winning next year’s election.

Between March 2010 and March 2014, the number of people in work in the UK has risen by 1.6million, but in the other 27 EU countries the figure has fallen by 1.07million, according to Eurostat figures

David Cameron, pictured at the Nato summit in Wales, has boasted that the figures show his economic plan is working.

Growth in the UK jobs market has surged in the last year, in marked contrast with other EU countries.

The economy is now bigger than before the 2008 financial crash, after securing growth of 3.2 per cent in the year to June.

There are now more than 30million people in work, the highest since records began.

Between March 2010 and March 2014, the number of people in work in the UK rose from 28.66million to 30.26million, a rise of 1.6million or six per cent, according to figures from Eurostat.

Over the same four year period, the numbers in work in all 28 EU member states rose by 540,000 to 215billion, an increase of just 0.3 per cent.

When Britain is excluded, employment in the remaining 27 countries fell by 1.067million or 0.6 per cent.

Only Germany saw a bigger rise in the numbers in work, up by 1.996million.

By contrast, there have been dramatic falls in employment in Spain (down 1.7million), Greece (942,000) and Italy (586,000) – countries hardest hit by the eurozone crisis.

Employment Minister Esther McVey told MailOnline: 'The huge drop in unemployment is a sign of how the hard work of our Jobcentre Plus advisers who are supporting people off benefits and into a wide variety of jobs and careers is paying off.

“British businesses are vibrant, confident and leading the way in taking a chance on jobseekers - we see this day in, day out with the local employers we work with. 

'Through our welfare reforms, we’re providing more tailored support so that all of those who can work do, and they can get the opportunity to develop the skills and work experience they need to make the most of the 650,000 vacancies available in the economy at any one time.'

Mr Cameron boasted of the trend as he addressed a meeting of Tory MPs on Tuesday evening.

He delivered an upbeat message that the economy is booming but the job is not yet done, stressing that the Conservatives can win 'if we stick to our long term economic plan'.

Yesterday it emerged Britain’s economy has grown more quickly than previously thought since the Coalition took power.

In the four years since 2010 the economy has grown by 8.1 per cent – 1.1 per cent more than the original estimate, according to the Office for National Statistics.

It means the economy is now 2.7 per cent bigger than it was before the economic crash in 2007.

Overall, Britain has enjoyed the third best economic growth in the G7 since 2010 – more than France and Germany, but still behind the US and Canada.

Speaking at Prime Minister Questions, Mr Cameron said: ‘ ‘There should not be any complacency, because the job is not yet done, but our long-term economic plan is working and it is the way to secure a better future for our country.’
