A tractor-trailer hauling cars has crashed into an upstate New York restaurant, killing one person, causing multiple injuries and collapsing part of the building.

The identity of the person killed when the truck crashed into Simeon's restaurant at about 4pm on Friday was not disclosed in a press conference.

However, the owner of Simeon's restaurant told WSYR on Friday the victim was a female bartender with a young child. Her name has not yet been released.

Officer Jamie Williamson, who spoke at the press conference, asked anyone with information on the crash to contact the Ithaca Police Department.

Williamson told MailOnline via telephone that five people were transported to the hospital and treated for minor injuries. He said several other victims transported themselves to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries, but did not give a specific number.

A crane was been brought in, Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick said in the press conference, and that there was 'some risk' of a building collapse.

'We want to save the building if we can, it's beautiful and it's historic,' he said, 'but safety is our number one priority right now. So if we feel that the building is going to collapse, we will take it down ourselves.'

Williamson said in the conference that the driver is cooperating with police and no charges have been filed. The investigation is continuing.

Williamson also commented on bystanders who rushed to help victims of the crash.

'It was a great community effort,' he said in the conference. 'You know, that's one of the beautiful things about Ithaca is folks coming together and you know in times of grief, in times of emergency - you know, in any time where there's somebody that needs help, Ithaca is first and foremost in line to help that person.'

Victims: One person was killed and at least five others were hospitalized for minor injuries

Driver: The driver of the truck that crashed into the restaurant is cooperating with police

Zoe Klatz, a waitress at a nearby restaurant, expressed her shock to the Ithaca Voice.

'It just happened so fast,' she said. 'It was so insane I thought it was like I was watching a movie. It was terrifying.'

Witness Dintu Sidiki also told the Voice she was frightened by the crash.

'I was so scared, I thought the whole building was going to fall down because bricks just started flying across the street,' she said. 'I was so scared. I didnâ€™t know what to do. I literally thought we were all going to die.'

Ithaca, home to Cornell University and Ithaca College, is 45 miles south of Syracuse.
