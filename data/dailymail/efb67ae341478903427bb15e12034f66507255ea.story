Prince Andrew has a home there, the Danish royals visit each year and now Prince Harry has joined the well-heeled crowds in Verbier.

The 30-year-old was pictured skiing in the Swiss resort with a group including cousins Princess Eugenie, in a blue jacket with black helmet, and Beatrice, 26, in a white jacket and grey helmet.

Eugenie, 24, wrapped up in a bright blue ski jacket and salopettes while Harry, 30, looked sporty in a black ski jacket and beige trousers.

Thanks their safety-conscious helmets and sunglasses, the royals were barely recognisable so drew little attention as they skied in the sunshine.

After enjoying themselves on the slopes, the group took a break from skiing when they reached the Le Carrefour restaurant which boasts a sheltered dining terrace and 'great views over Verbier' on its website.

Verbier is famously popular with the rich and famous, with Virgin tycoon Richard Branson among those to own a home there.

Unusually, his chalet, known as The Lodge, can be booked through his travel company Virgin Unlimited by paying guests, although a stay costs up to CHF 172,910 (£120,000) per week.

Another Verbier chalet owner is Prince Andrew, who was in the resort with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and their two daughters for New Year.

They were joined on that occasion by Cressida Bonas, who, like Prince Harry, has long been a fan of the resort.

Indeed, it was during Harry's 2013 trip to the resort that he went public about their relationship and was spotted canoodling with the aristocratic blonde on the ski slopes.  

This year there were no hugs and kisses for Harry on the slopes, although thanks to the presence of Beatrice, Eugenie and their friends, he had no shortage of company.

The British royals also had a group of blue-blooded holidaymakers from another country to keep them entertained on the piste. 

Earlier this week, members of the Danish royal family were pictured enjoying a break from official duties on a family ski holiday.

Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and Crown Princess Mary, 43, are staying at the resort with their four children Prince Christian, nine, Princess Isabella, seven, and four-year-old twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine. 

Unlike Harry and Eugenie, the Danish royals have chosen to spend their time away from the black runs and are indulging in a spot of child-friendly tobogganing instead. 

The two sets of royals do, however, know each other, with Prince Harry pictured chatting to Crown Prince Frederik during last September's Invictus Games. 

Members of the Danish royal family are also in Verbier, among them Crown Prince Frederik (back row right)

The Danish royals took a more low-key approach to the piste and hit the slopes on a toboggan instead
