Selfie lovers with a head for heights can now enjoy taking a hair-raising snap from the Eiffel Tower thanks to a new see-through floor.

Paris’ top attraction officially unveiled the glass floor today as part of a £24m refit that allows visitors to feel as if they are walking on air nearly 200 feet above ground.

Stephen Laine, a 48-year-old British tourist visiting with his wife and four young children, said: ‘It's an incredible feeling.

'We checked out the new floor last week and it was incredible - scary at first, because your brain tells you that you might be about to fall through, but you soon get used to it.’

Inaugurated by Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, the first-floor refit also includes new solar panels and the opening of a museum where the history of the tower will be displayed on seven screens.

‘It's an innovative development which will maintain the tower as one of the most fantastic attractions in the world,' said a member of her staff.

‘The Tower symbolises Paris and is famous everywhere - it is a great success story for the city, and for France.'

Built as an entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, the iron lattice edifice, named after engineer Gustav Eiffel, whose company built the tower, was supposed to be dismantled in 1909. 

But it is now the most popular paid-for tourist attraction in the world, attracting almost seven million visitors last year alone.

Because of massive queues to the top of the 1,060-ft tower, many visitors only get as far as the first floor.

Now they can all feel as if they are suspended in air, as they look out across the centre of the city, and the suburbs beyond.

In a job that involved 60 tons of paint, the three-level 'Iron Lady' has to be repainted every year.
