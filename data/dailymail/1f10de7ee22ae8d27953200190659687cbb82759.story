From racing coats and rain macs to less practical miniature tutus, it may seem that every fashionable dog needs an impressive wardrobe.

Now, there’s a coat encrusted with LEDs that can flash different colours and display scrolling messages that aims to turn any mutt into a party pooch.

Disco Dog claims to be the first LED dog vest that can be controlled using a smartphone.

Party pooch: A coat encrusted with LEDs that can flash different colours and display scrolling messages (pictured) aims to turn any mutt into a party pooch. 

A start-up firm called Party NYC, based in New York and Tokyo, is in the process of creating the final version of the vest, which has 256 LEDs on the outside, as well as a concealed microcontroller, a Bluetooth low energy chip and a 3.7V lithium ion battery. 

The vest displays a variety of animated patterns and text in thousands of colours.

‘You can choose an animation or type in a message using our Disco Dog application on your smartphone,’ it said on its Kickstarter page. 

An accompanying app (pictured) can be used to program the design on the vest and control the LEDs from a distance. There are controls for brightness and colour, including ‘two-colour gradients that flow across the vest’ as well as room to type words (right) and even a lost dog mode

‘It's a fun way to celebrate your dog, and also keeps her visible and safe when it's dark out.’

An accompanying app will be used to program the design on the vest and control the LEDs from a distance.

There will be controls for brightness and colour, including ‘two-colour gradients that flow across the vest’.

As well as creating a stir on the doggie dance floor, the illuminated vest will be used to find lost dogs.

‘If your dog runs too far away and the connection is lost, the vest will show an automatic ‘Lost Dog’ message, asking bystanders to help the lost pup find her way back,’ the company said.

The adjustable vest will have Velcro closures and the LED grid will be removable so it can be washed and the battery recharged.

The company is raising funds on Kickstarter to put its Disco Dog vest into production.

‘We're still in beta phase, iterating our physical design, improving the mobile app, and gauging public interest,’ it said.

‘We hope the support we receive through Kickstarter will help us quickly develop Disco Dog into a product that can be manufactured on a larger scale,’

A total of 80 vests will be made at first and they will come in three sizes: small, medium and large.

They can be pre-ordered for $300 (£203) for the smallest and $400 (£271) for large.
