Katie - not her real name - who is pictured, was abused by an older man when she was a teenager and claims social workers knew what was going on

A woman who was abused as a teenager told last night how social workers allowed her to have daily contact with a man ten years older than her who was suspected of grooming dozens of young girls for sex.

Katie – not her real name – was one of 54 girls abused by the man she saw as her boyfriend, as well as his friends.

She says that despite knowing he had served two stints in jail for violent crime and was part of a circle of men under investigation for sexual exploitation, social workers allowed her to leave her foster home at night to meet him.

Katie said she was shocked to hear that, in fact, more than 1,400 girls had been victims of sexual exploitation in Rotherham.

Now 29, she is one of 15 girls bringing a civil case against the council and police. She said ‘people at the top’ had covered up what happened to her and the others.

Katie added: ‘They knew what he was capable of. They thought he was a pimp and was getting me into drugs. They’re trained to recognise it and they were adults. They’ve got to be stupid not to recognise the signs of abuse.

'I was a child in danger – that should have been recognised. I think it is a massive cover-up. They knew it was happening – there are files showing they knew.

'I think it was all done deliberately. They called me a liar and now all this comes out – it just shows the total lack of respect that council has for victims like me.’

Katie, pictured, had just turned 14 when she met her abuser through friends in 1999. He began contacting her every day and the pair soon started a relationship.

Even then the man was 24, married and had already been in prison twice for violent crimes. Katie believes the authorities also suspected that he was part of a small group involved in the grooming and sexual exploitation of more than 40 teenagers in Rotherham.

But far from protecting Katie, she says bungling police and social services failed to halt his abuse and actually facilitated it.

Her desperate parents did everything they could to stop the relationship with the man, who has never been prosecuted for any sexual abuse against a child.

They tried to stop her going out and even cut off the phone lines so he couldn’t call. At one point her parents reported her as missing to the police, knowing she was with him.

But instead of arresting him, Katie says police negotiated a deal whereby he handed her over to officers on a petrol forecourt on condition he wouldn’t be arrested.

Things took a more sinister turn when, after her 15th birthday, police found her semi-naked, hiding under a bed in a house.

Her parents then agreed to have her placed in care in the hope that it would finally break the abuser’s hold over their daughter. But once in social care Katie was allowed to see her ‘boyfriend’ every day, despite the fact that he was increasingly violent and controlling.

 

Large-scale child exploitation in the town has been revealed in a damning report. Pictured: Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council Offices in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. 

Incredibly, Katie says workers at the foster home where she was living sometimes allowed her to go out and see him at night.

Katie believed the pair were in ‘a normal relationship’. She began skipping school to see him, and going missing from her home for longer periods. Before she was 16, he had got her pregnant twice.

She said: ‘They placed me in care thinking it would keep me away from him but the social workers said I could see him as long as I was home by 10pm and met him at the top of the street. At that time I thought it was a normal boyfriend-girlfriend relationship.

‘My family were on my case, saying he was dangerous and that he was too old for me but I didn’t listen. I was just a typical teenager, I thought my parents wanted to ruin my life.’
