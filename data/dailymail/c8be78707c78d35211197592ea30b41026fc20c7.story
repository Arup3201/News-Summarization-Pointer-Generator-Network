A Lebanese pop star caused outrage in the Arab world by wearing a revealing dress during a talent show performance condemned by many as 'scandalous'.

Haifa Wehbe, 38, was appearing on a live episode of Arab Star Academy, a pan-Arab TV music talent contest, donning a figure-hugging long black dress with revealing sheer panels.

More than two million people watched the seductive performance and many women took to social media to criticise Wehbe for her racy choice of outfit.

Commenting on footage of the performance on social media, many wrote 'scandalous' with one YouTube user writing: 'Art has limits and you, Haifa, have crossed the line'.

Wehbe regularly causes a stir with her revealing outfits - especially among the Arab  world - where many women uphold strict conservative traditions of dress.

Most of the negative reactions on social media came from  women in Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

In Saudi Arabia, women are required to cover up from head to toe, often with only their eyes exposed.

One Egyptian woman tweeted: 'It is true that we got used to her wearing scandalous clothes but not to this extent…it was a shock for the viewers.'

Some sick posts even suggested that Wehbe should be introduced to hard line ISIS militants with one man writing on Facebook: 'These type of Arab female celebrities need to meet the Islamic State.' 

Another shared an image of a man with a long beard holding a mobile phone with the caption 'hello…ISIS!!' - suggesting he was reporting the pop star to the terrorist group.

In response to the online criticism, many fans weighed into the debate to defend the Lebanese pop star

The debate about the dress shows just how divided the Arab world has become on such matters.

Dana Khairallah, a Lebanese lifestyle blogger, told the BBC: 'They think if women dress this way it would misrepresent our culture.

'I find that hypocritical. I see Arab girls dressing more provocatively in clubs but no one cares because there are no cameras.

'There's also an element of social media meanness in what is happening that drives this bullying of celebrities.'

In response to the criticism from conservative viewers in the Arab world, thousands of the singer's fans posted messages of support on social media - with one highlighting the stark difference between her outfit and Kim Kardashian's recent photo shoot.

Sawsun Abu Omar wrote: 'After Kim Kardahsian's attempt to break the internet, I find Haifa Wehbe's see-through dress on star academy to be quite modest.'

Wehbe, pictured here in 2003, blamed the stage lighting in a tweet, saying the original dress appeared more modest but that she 'was surprised that it looked very different with the strong lighting on the stage'

The Egyptian channel CBC, which airs the Star Academy TV show, issued an apology on its channel for the star's appearance on the show. 

Wehbe herself blamed the stage lighting in a tweet, saying the original dress appeared more modest but that she 'was surprised that it looked very different with the strong lighting on the stage.'
