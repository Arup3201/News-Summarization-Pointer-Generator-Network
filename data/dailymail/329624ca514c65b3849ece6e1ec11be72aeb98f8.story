They're sweet, creamy and cold – just the way a good summer treat should be.

But summer cooler drinks have been branded 'toxic sugar bombs' after it was discovered that they contain up to 20 teaspoons of sugar- that's the equivalent of 31 digestive biscuits.

An investigation by The Sunday Mirror found that summer cooler drinks from coffee giants such as Costa and Starbucks contain a worrying amount of sugar.

Sugar bomb: An investigation has shown that iced coffees from high street coffee giants contain an alarmingly high amount of sugar

They found that a medium Toffee Creamy ­Cooler contains a shocking 81.6 grams of sugar - the same content as in 31 digestive biscuits.

Not only is the sugar content an issue, the drink also contains the recommended daily amount of saturated fat for a woman in just a few sips.

Starbucks are also guilty of packing the sugar into their summer drinks.

One culprit is the large ­Strawberries and Cream ­Frappuccino, which contains a staggering 76.2 grams of sugar – that's more than 18 teaspoons' worth.

Health warning: Costa and Starbucks are amongst the worst culprits with a Costa Toffee Creamy Cooler (L) containing a shocking 81.6 grams of sugar - the same content as in 31 digestive biscuits

It may appear healthy because it contains fruit in the title but the frappuccino also contains  a massive  459 calories because of its cream and full-fat milk content. That's almost as many calories as a McDonald's Big Mac.

The Starbucks peppermint mocha frappuccino in venti with whole milk and whipped cream is 540 calories.

A spokesman for Starbucks said: 'We 
promote choice at Starbucks and were one of the first high street food 
and drink retailers to display calorie content on our menu boards, as 
part of our commitment to the Department of Health’s Responsibility 
Deal.

'All product nutritional information is also easily available on our website to help inform customers’ choices.

'The Strawberries and Cream 
Frappuccino is one of a range of summer drinks we offer at Starbucks, 
from indulgent treats like a Frappuccino to a Refresha.

For example, a grande (medium) Cool 
Lime Refresha contains 17g of sugar and less than 100 calories. 
Customers can also customise their drinks  to reduce calorie and sugar 
content - we have a Strawberries and Cream Frappuccino Light, which 
reduces calories by approximately a third.

Customers can also choose to have a smaller size, skimmed milk, sugar free syrups, and forgo whipped cream.'

Costa's strawberry cooler is an even worse offender - a large size with cream and full fat milk is 653 calories -  that's the same as having a McDonald's burger and fries.

Meanwhile, Caffe Nero's 
whole milk caramel frappe latte is 455 calories, the equivalent to two 
large glasses of white wine and some pretzels.

Now that brands are under more pressure 
to display nutritional information on their products, consumers are 
becoming more savvy to the hidden calories in shop bought coffees.

With this in mind, anti-obesity ­campaigners have called for the Government to impose limits on calories and sugars.

Dr Ian Campbell, head of the National Obesity Forum, told The Sunday Mirror that the stance taken by the likes of Costa and ­Starbucks is only contributing to the obesity crisis.

He told them: 'The nutritional information for these drinks is quite staggering.

'The ­combination of one of these beverages with, say, a brownie is actually quite toxic.

'You’re looking at a sugar bomb. It’s because of products like this that people are facing an obesity crisis. There can be no responsible justification for it.'

A spokesman for Costa told MailOnline: Costa takes the nutritional balance of all its food and drink very seriously.

'We have increased the quality of information available in store and online via our Costa nutritional tool and have carried out a lot of work, particularly in the Iced drink range to reduce calorie content with the intention to continuing to find ways to reduce fat, calories and sugar levels throughout our product offerings.

'Last year we introduced our iced-lemonades to the range, with the primo size containing less than 100 calories. Our Skinny Iced Cappuccino has fewer than 50Kcals.

'Costa seeks to provide customers with a choice of products across its drink and food ranges, meeting all key health trends; allowing them to choose lower-calorie options if they so wish as well as a more indulgent occasional treat'.

  The 18 teaspoons of sugar found in the Starbucks iced drink is equivalent to eating:    An entire box of six Mr Kipling Cherry Bakewell tarts

    11 packs of Marks and Spencer's Percy Pig sweets

    19 30g servings of Kellogg's Rice Crispies

    2 Mars bars
