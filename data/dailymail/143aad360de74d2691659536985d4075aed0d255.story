An ABC reporter who has been criticised for touching clothes and debris from the MH17 plane crash has defended his actions saying 'it's not as though it's a crime scene'.

Phil Williams was shown handling victims' belongings in a report published on the ABC website after a Sky journalist was also seen sifting through personal possessions among the wreckage of the Malaysia Airlines plane - sparking 110 viewer complaints.

The ABC report was removed from its website for re-editing as Mr Williams told the broadcaster's PM show on Monday: 'I am guilty of picking up, touching a scarf on the ground'.

Since the bodies of the 298 victims fell from 33,000ft after their plane was struck by a surface-to-air missile, they were left in the open in sweltering heat for three days before being gathered up in bags, bundled on to trucks and driven away.

Their belongings were scattered over several kilometres across fields near a village in Rassypnoye in eastern Ukraine.

Mr Williams explained his actions, which have been branded inappropriate, by saying: 'There are piles of people's belongings that have just been collected and dumped on the roadside, they've been picked through and so it's not as though it's a crime scene, an uncontaminated crime scene there.'

He added: 'It's a very difficult scene to report on. Literally the evidence is everywhere you walk.'

An ABC spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald that they have 'reminded journalists of responsibilities when reporting from an air crash scene such as MH17'.

They confirmed: 'A report has been re-edited to avoid any distress to our audience.'

In his ABC news report from the tragic scene, Mr Williams said: 'As we come over this way here, as we walk through, you will see little bits and pieces of people's everyday lives. Someone's shawl there. Over here, one of the backs of one of the plane's chairs.

'There are little bits everywhere as I walk - another large chunk of the aircraft and very sadly a lot of personal items.'

The ABC are re-editing the video so that Mr Williams can't be seen picking up a victim's purple scarf

Sky News also apologised after in a live broadcast, presenter Colin Brazier was shown picking items – including a set of keys and a toothbrush – out of someone's open luggage before saying: 'We really shouldn't be doing this, I suppose.'

The report has so far sparked 110 complaints with television watchdog Ofcom, amid growing anger over the desecration of the crash site and allegations of looting by pro-Russian rebels.

Brazier's actions has also sparked a furious response on social media - with one Twitter user asking 'Why is Colin Brazier still on my telly?'

Sky News reporter Colin Brazier was reporting from Donetsk this morning despite a row breaking out over footage of him sifting through personal belongings among the wreckage of Flight MH17

Apology: Sky News reporter Colin Brazier apologised after rifling through a case at the scene of the crash

Brazier's actions has also sparked a furious response on social media - with one Twitter user asking 'Why is Colin Brazier still on my telly?', while others appeared to defend the veteran reporter

BBC radio presenter Shelagh Fogarty 
said: ‘Sky!! Get your reporter to STOP rummaging thru the belongings at 
#mH17 crash site. “We shouldn’t really be doing this” NO S**T Sherlock 
!! Those items are essentially sacred things now for the relatives. Just
 appalling.’

Media professor Joe Watson called it a ‘horrible moment for journalism’.

A
 post by Joey Blower added: ‘Colin Brazier has interfered with a crime 
scene in the most distasteful manner. It must be investigated fully.’

Ofcom said there had been 110 complaints, relating to coverage on Sky News on 20 July from 12pm and throughout the day.

A spokesman added: 'These are being assessed. A decision has not been made yet as to whether there will be an investigation.'

Sky News has refused to say whether disciplinary action would be taken against the veteran reporter, or whether there are any plans for him to return.

In a statement they added: ‘Today whilst presenting from the site of 
the MH17 air crash, Colin Brazier reflected on the human tragedy of the 
event and showed audiences the content of one of the victims’ bags. 
Colin immediately recognised that this was inappropriate and said so on 
air.

‘Both Colin and Sky 
News apologise profusely for any offence caused.’ Brazier later gave a 
moving account of coming across scores of human remains at the site.

He
 said: ‘I’ve been walking around, coming across body parts all the time,
 many of them charred beyond recognition. Men, women and children, 
indeterminate frankly, you can’t tell. Very often you are looking at 
charred spines, that’s all that’s left.

Scene of the crash: Brazier has come under flack for his latest dispatch from the scene in eastern Ukraine

'Inappropriate': Viewers blasted the broadcast as Brazier lifted up items one by one including keys and a flask

Live on air: The reporter, currently based in eastern Ukraine, censored himself saying 'we shouldn't do this'

Sky News received complaints from viewers as Twitter users urging people to complain to Ofcom

‘It is a truly macabre, horrific situation. There is a degree of anarchy and lawlessness.’

Several
 witnesses have reported seeing armed separatists rifling through 
possessions at the crash site and pocketing valuables, including 
electronic equipment.

Ukraine
 has also accused members of pro-Russian militia of stealing credit 
cards and has warned families of those who died to cancel their loved 
ones’ accounts.

Anton Gerashchenko, a government official in Kiev, said:
 ‘I have received information that terrorist death-hunters were 
collecting not only cash and jewellery of the dead passengers but also 
credit cards. My humble request to the relatives of the victims is to 
freeze their credit cards, so that they won’t lose their assets to 
terrorists.’

The crash scene
 was still not sealed off properly yesterday. Reporters continued to 
traipse over fields, while local residents wandered around like 
tourists.

Emotional: Families have issued pleas to officials on the site to return their loved ones' personal effects

Recovery: Identifiable bodies have been placed in refrigerated trains but belongings remain strewn about

Political: After three days of negotiations, Russia has agreed to hand over the black box and bodies

Some respectfully left flowers beside the broken suitcases and smashed computers that littered the landscape.

Many of the piles of possessions seen on Saturday, looted by officials on both sides of the conflict, had been moved again.

Among
 the small mementos of lives snuffed out were biographies of former 
football managers Kevin Keegan, Ron Atkinson and Brian Clough, laying 
beside a main road. There was speculation they could have belonged to 
the Newcastle United fans John Adler, 63 and Liam Sweeney, 28, who were 
killed in the disaster.

Elsewhere
 in the fields of wildflowers and rippling corn, sitting incongruously 
among aeroplane parts and electrical innards, were heartbreaking little 
pieces of evidence of the child victims aboard Flight MH17.

A
 girl’s ‘Secret Diary’ could be seen next to a tiny silver bracelet 
glinting in the sun and a packet of unopened Haribo sweets.
