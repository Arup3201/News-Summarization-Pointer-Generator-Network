Jailed: Duncan Schwier, pictured arriving at Isleworth Crown Court today, stole from the world's largest musical corporation for more than a decade

A music executive who admitted to stealing almost £650,000 from record label giant Universal Music Group - whose artists include U2 and Prince - was today jailed for three years. 

Duncan Schwier, the company's former head of global production, swindled the world's largest musical corporation with false invoices for more than a decade. 

The 52-year-old claimed that he had given most of the money to his colleagues and to charity after a series of medical conditions left him behaving erratically.

The con only came to light when Schwier was promoted and his successor raised the alarm after noticing scores of invoices paid to non-existent companies.  

Schwier, from Twickenham, west London, pleaded guilty earlier this month to one count of stealing £643,697.35 between December 31, 2001 and December 31, last year, from Universal - where he had worked since 1984.

The French-owned multinational represents artists including U2, Eminem, 50 Cent and Jennifer Lopez.

Prosecutor Olu Phillips told Isleworth Crown Court that an enquiry and investigation had revealed that the defendant had stolen the money by paying invoices for two 'fictitious' companies.

He said: 'Once the transactions were authorised the payments were made and funds went into one of his bank accounts.' 

Shwier spent £400,000 on staff bonuses, parties and gifts - with one colleague getting an expensive guitar as a leaving present - and gave £100,000 to charity, the court heard.

Schwier, who put his six-bedroom detached Edwardian house on the market for £1.75million last year, admitted the theft immediately and repaid all the money soon after, the court heard.  

Lawrence Selby, defending, told the court how the longstanding employee of Universal Music Group had been rendered irresponsible because of his condition. 

The executive’s poor health, which began with a diagnosis of Graves disease in 1998, left him with impaired judgement, he claimed.

The disease can lead to hyperactivity in suffers, although a judge allowed precise details of his medical record to be withheld.  

Mr Selby said: 'It is a fairly depressing read that unfortunately nobody was able to effectively diagnose Mr Schwier.

'He reacted badly to medication and things went badly from one thing to another.

'It’s the sort of decade that those would not want to experience either personally or through those closest to them.

'He was working in a pressure cooker industry, unable to cry for help, unaware he was suffering in the way that he was, and these acts were a release for the stress and pressure.'

He claimed that he gave away £400,000 to his own staff in gifts and bonuses and £100,000 to various charities.

The first staff gift was an expensive guitar for a colleague who was leaving and the bonuses, parties and dinners followed.  

The court heard how the theft came to an end when he was diagnosed with cancer, believing it was terminal.

Mr Selby said: 'This was not theft that was motivated by greed or personal gain... it is theft more like someone who is addicted to something, who needs satisfaction of that addiction to survive.' 

He said Mr Schwier did not spend the money on himself or his family, whose lives remained the same throughout the con.

Universal Music Group initially dealt with the theft internally before alerting police. Schwier admitted the theft immediately and repaid all the money soon after, Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) heard

He had driven the same 'clapped-out' Volvo for 15 years and 'displayed no signs of an ostentatious lifestyle', the court heard.

Schwier admitted the theft immediately and repaid all the money soon after, the court heard.

Judge Aidan Marron, QC, said a custodial sentence was unavoidable.

Jailing the executive for three years, he said: 'I accept that on the medical evidence put before me that throughout this period you suffered from serious medical disability that impacted on your judgement and ability.

'But at the end of the day the serious breach of trust over more than a decade I’m afraid that a custodial sentence is inevitable.'
