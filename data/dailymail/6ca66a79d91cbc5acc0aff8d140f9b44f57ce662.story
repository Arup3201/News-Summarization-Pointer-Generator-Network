A height of 5ft 9in, thigh gap and cheekbones to rival Kate Moss' were once prerequisites when it came to breaking the modelling industry - but Lucy Greene and Pandora Lennard are trying to change all that.

The two young entrepreneurs have set up the Anti-agency, which hand-picks talent based not on their looks or size but on their personality, passions and individual style.

Speaking to MailOnline about their new business venture, founders Lucy and Pandora, both 24 and from London, said: 'We don't look for stereotypical models, we look for boys and girls with great personality, good style, charisma and interesting hobbies; the whole package.'

Forget outside Topshop on Oxford Street, the duo, who worked in fashion before setting up the Anti-agency nine months ago, scout talent on Facebook, at art galleries and at gigs where they know they'll find 'interesting' people.

Speaking about their selection process, they said: 'Our models may be good looking but we specifically choose to use "head shots" so that people aren't judged on their height or weight by clients. We have models ranging from size 6-14 and 5ft 4in to 6ft 2in of all ethnicities.'

Interesting: The agency, which has been operating for nine months, scouts people with interesting passions and supports their careers (pictured: student Chiara)

She continues: 'The agency is for people who could’ve been models and decided not to, for people who are too cool to be models and people with real lives on the verge of exploding in music, fashion, art, illustration and creative industries.

'We're here to provide casting solutions for companies and to promote people we believe in, as well as supporting their careers.'

Lucy and Pandora, whose client list includes the likes of Dr. Martens, Urban Outfitters and Asos, maintain that they'd never ask or encourage their talent to change the way they are.

Success: Despite only operating for nine months, the girls have had their talent walk in Pam Hogg and Vivienne Westwood shows this season (pictured left, poet Amy and right, fashion student Abby)

'They are what they are. We've had people making yearly wages from a bit of modelling but none of them want to go full time, they are focused on their respective careers. Some are artists, others are musicians.'

Despite only operating for nine months, the girls have had their talent walk in Pam Hogg and Vivienne Westwood shows this season, as well as in Giles alongside Cara Delevingne - who they credit for shaking up the industry.

'Cara represents a change in the industry, clients want models with big personalities. Models like Cara and Chloe Nørgaard have other strings to their bows and a huge social media following because of their interesting personalities - they are building a brand,' they said.

The agency currently has nearly 100 models on its books and the founders have big plans for the future.

'We can't believe how well things are going, we want to go global. In five years time we see ourselves opening up in New York and LA, that would be the dream.'
