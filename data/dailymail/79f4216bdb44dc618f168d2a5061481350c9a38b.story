If you spotted David Cameron in your local restaurant, you would no doubt be taken aback.

Becky Smith certainly was when the Prime Minister wandered into a Bristol branch of Nando’s for a chicken peri-peri and a glass of wine.

And the 20-year-old managed to capture that sense of surprise with this cheekily snatched selfie alongside the obliging Premier.

Hot sauce man: Prime Minister David Cameron made an unexpected visit to a branch of Nando's in Bristol last night... but may have dashed his cool credentials by opting to have his meal with a glass of red wine

 Miss Smith, who was with a party of 
14 for a friend’s birthday, said: ‘When he walked past us we asked if we
 could have a picture and he stayed there chatting for a while.

‘I
 would honestly be the last person to say anything nice about the 
Conservatives but to give him his due, he was very warm, and quite 
funny. I then just swooped in and took the selfie.’

Witnesses
 said Mr Cameron dined on half a chicken with regular fries and 
coleslaw, washed down with a glass of red wine. Total cost: around £16 
(depending on the choice of wine).

The
 Prime Minister, taking a break from the European election campaign 
trail, plumped for ‘hot’ sauce (‘highly combustible; proceed with 
caution’). What’s more, he showed not a single sign of facial redness or
 discomfort.

Prime location: The Prime Minister dropped in on this branch of Nando's in Bristol city centre at around 8pm
