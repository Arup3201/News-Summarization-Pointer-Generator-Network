Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is reportedly pocketing big money for public speaking events, taking home almost half a million dollars from Goldman Sachs after giving two talks for the investment banking giant and their clients this week.

Clinton, who is considered a likely top contender for the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential race, is said to have received $200,000 per speaking engagement.

The first event was the AIMS Alternative Investment Conference hosted by Goldman Sachs last Thursday, which is a private conference that explores the latest strategies and products available to financial advisers, according to National Review.

Then on Tuesday, Clinton spoke at the Builders and Innovators Summit, which is devoted to discussing entrepreneurship and how to help innovators expand their businesses.

The news comes on the back of a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, which said the number of people who have a positive view of Clinton has dropped from a high of 58 percent in December to 46 percent today

Hillary Clinton was paid $400,000 to give two speeches hosted by investment banking firm Goldman Sachs, it has been claimed

Hillary Clinton has become a prominent name on the talking circuit, much like husband Bill Clinton, who last year alone earned $17 million from giving speeches

The New York Times reports that Clinton has been using her impressive government resume to garner large speaking fees since leaving her post at the State Department earlier this year

It's a strategy used extremely successfully by her husband, former US president Bill Clinton, who earned $17 million for speeches alone last year.

His engagements outside the United States are said to be the most profitable.

But it is Hilary's latest transactions that are raising eyebrows.

While there is no suggestion Clinton has done anything wrong, the issue at hand is a large financial transaction happening between a potential presidential candidate and one of the most powerful investment banks in America.

Richard Kim, editor of weekly magazine The Nation, said Clinton was 'ill-equipped' to speak at events centering on finance and the business world.

Speaking of Clinton's impressive contact book of 'billionaires and corporate giants like Walmart, Goldman Sachsâ€™ Lloyd Blankfein, Mike Bloomberg, Hollywood mogul Steve Bing and Paychex chairman Tom Golisano', Kim said although Clinton may not 'solicit the advice of all these folks'. she will almost surely 'solicit their donations'.

In terms of the banking world, Clinton also made visits to private-equity firms KKR in July and the Carlyle Group in September.

At KKR's annual investor meeting in California, she answered questions from firm co-founder Henry Kravis on the Middle East, Washington and politics.

At Carlyle Group, Clinton made a speech to shareholders moderated by Carlyly founder David Rubenstein.

Both Clinton's office and Goldman Sachs did to respond to requests for comment about the speaking engagements.

Last weekend Clinton gave her surest sign yet that she will as a presidential candidate.

Speaking at a repetition at St Andrew's University in Scotland, where she received an honorary degree, Clinton was asked if she intends to run.

'I haven't made up my mind yet,' she said.

When guests joked that her answer wasn't satisfactory, she replied: 'Yes, it is unsatisfactory. I'm minded to do it.'
