I am not a fit man.

This is the thought that goes barrelling around my head as I lay my mountain bike against a pineapple bush, and slump against the bark of a mango tree. I lean back, and survey the sweeping, verdant panorama of the plantation fields before me. I am exhausted.

It is only the second day of my attempt to traverse Costa Rica by muscle power. And while the scenery is spectacular, it turns out that my lung capacity is not.

Can a view still be breathtaking when you don't have the breath to take it in, I wonder?

Success, in spite of it all: Matt celebrates as he reaches the Pacific coast of Costa Rica - after a week of pain

How did I get here? Well firstly, by following the crowd.

Adventure travel holidays are on the rise. The market has grown at 65 per cent a year since 2009, according to the Adventure Tourism Marketing Study. With such statistics, surely anyone can climb onto a bike, or up a mountain, or down a glacier, right? Right?

Throwing caution (and common sense) to the wind, I decide to book myself onto a trip that offers the opportunity to 'Conquer Costa Rica' - through by bike and raft alone.

Now, if you are going to 'conquer' any country - in terms of crossing it, rather than anything, you know, military - Costa Rica is an excellent choice. It may comprise only 0.1 per cent of the world's landmass, but it boasts five per cent of its biodiversity, with scenery varying from sub-alpine dwarf vegetation to unspoiled rainforest, coastlines of white sand, and arid, dusty farmland.

Add in a wildlife checklist to make even David Attenborough jealous (jaguars, monkeys, toucans, parrots, green sea turtles and roughly 850 species of birds), and it is a must-see for any traveller.

Taking a well-deserved breather: Matt enjoys a moment of respite during his marathon cross-country ride

Working on the presumption that you never forget how to ride a bike, and that I have previously cycled 40 miles over two days through undulating Venetian countryside (with multiple prosecco- and pizza-stops along the way), I set off to Costa Rica with a whopping two hours of gym training under my belt.

It is a fearsome preparation regime that pays off wonderfully for the first two days, as our group glides down the gorgeous Pacuare River on rafts - with nothing but the occasional splash-inducing rapid, blue butterfly kerfuffle or waterfall ascent (and subsequent leap down) to break up the day.

But the next leg of our trip - a 300-mile bike ride from the Caribbean to the Pacific coast, west across the torso of the country - will not turn out to be quite as gentle.

After a short drive, we unload our bikes on the edge of the Caribbean Sea, just a few hundred metres from where Christopher Columbus anchored in 1502. It is an inspiring start, and with a belly full of the local gallo pinto (rice and beans) fuelling our calves, we set off on a 32-mile day ride.

A sight to soothe the soul: Costa Rica deals in spectacular scenery - and glorious sunsets

The route takes in beachside trundles under coconut trees, with howler monkeys and sloths alternately wailing and unfurling in the rainforest overhead.

We play games of cardiovascular hopscotch across train tracks with bikes in tow, and eat a native cascado lunch (meat, salad, rice and beans) in a locals-only hangout.

We chart a heady route through working banana plantations (and enjoy a fascinating introduction to fruit-picking, courtesy of our local guides and those working in the fields).

Predictably (or hilariously, depending on your viewpoint), things did not stay quite as sedate.

While meteorologists may praise Costa Rica for its 'perfect' tropical climate, conditions feel less than ideal when you are cycling in 36°C heat. With no shade.

Are you sure this was a good idea? Matt did little training ahead of his epic ride - but survived

Throw in numerous boat crossings (some across crocodile-infested waters), groin-destroying mega-rides (80 miles with multiple off-road stretches, and with a volcano-scaling finale) and I - for one - am not laughing (I do not have the energy).

Add in the occasional over-the-handlebars face-plant, and each day becomes a true challenge. Not only of fitness, but of mental fortitude.

Of course, the whole incredible journey brings with it timeless memories: endorphine-soaring stretches alongside stunningly beautiful azure lakes, and speedy blitzes through dazzling limestone quarries. Muscle-soothing soaks in natural hot springs at the foot of volcanoes, and lazy lunches relaxing in the shade of mango trees.

And, best of all, the final, ecstatic joy of cracking open a bottle of champagne while gazing at the Pacific Ocean, after 300 miles of hard-fought exertion.

The real joy of adventure travel is the sobering gift of perspective.

Sure, I may not be as fit or prepared as I should be.

But when your biggest concern is how many bewilderingly gorgeous mountains you have to summit in a single day, aching legs and a few thousand beads of sweat are a small price.
