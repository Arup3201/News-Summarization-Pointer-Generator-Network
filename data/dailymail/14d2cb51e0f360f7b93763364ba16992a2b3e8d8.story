A 16-year-old girl is dead after being shot in her own bedroom by a stranger she had never meet before in what police believe was a tragic accident.

V’ondra Olivaria of Clayton County, Georgia, was visited at home by two boys - Brandon Williams, 17, and Justin Vitto, 20 - on Saturday evening.

Just minutes after the boys arrived, V’ondra’s mom Yolanda Rincon heard a gunshot and ran to her daughter’s room, where she saw a panicked Williams holding the weapon.

‘He shook my hand and not even five minutes later I heard a gun go off and my baby was gone,’ Rincon told WSB-TV.

Both Williams and Vitto quickly fled the scene, leaving Rincon to tend to her second oldest child as she passed away.

Neither Rincon nor investigators believe Williams intended to shoot V’ondra.

He was arrested on Sunday and police said the teenager has confessed to accidentally shooting the 16-year-old.

Williams has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, reckless conduct, possession of a handgun by a person under 18, obstruction and criminal trespassing.

He is being held without bond at the Clayton County jail. It was not known if Vitto will also face charges.

Mother of four Rincon described her daughter as a bubbly, caring teenager who loved posting pictures on Instagram and was in the 11th grade at North Clayton High School.

She said Williams had never met her daughter prior to Saturday night.
