Agile: Aliens can crawl on ceilings and pounce from great distances. Marines will have to work as a team

In space, nobody can hear you scream...with excitement.

For Aliens: Colonial Marines is fast approaching, and SEGA has released some brand new screens to whet fans' appetites.

Colonial Marines begins with an ostensibly abandoned ship, the U.S.S. Sulaco, recovered in orbit around LV-426.

Stranded: Marines are vulnerable by themselves, and will be torn to shreds if back-up doesn't arrive quickly

Players lead a group of highly trained United States Colonial Marines as they board the deserted craft to uncover the fate of the crew. 

Played through a first-person perspective, you'll get to use authentic weapons from the films - including flamethrowers, shotguns and the iconic Pulse Rifle.

If things get too tough, developers Gearbox have added a drop in, drop out co-op function, too.

He's behind you! There's a drop in / drop out co-op function which places a huge emphasis on teamwork

There is also a strong multiplayer component, where you can choose to be either an alien or marine. Xeno players rely on agility, while Marines have to work as a team to make the most out of their awesome firepower.
