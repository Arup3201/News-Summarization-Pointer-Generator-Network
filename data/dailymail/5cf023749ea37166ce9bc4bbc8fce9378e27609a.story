A severely malnourished 15-year-old girl was allegedly forced to live in the basement of a home by her parents for years while they beat her, starved her and even forced her to eat her own faeces.

The Wisconsin teenager had been forced to live in the house’s basement by her father, 40, and stepmother, 42, for six years and an alarm would sound if she went upstairs, police said.

She was found barefoot in pyjamas near her home last week and allegedly ate what she could find on the floor and in the rubbish, but her parents forced her to eat her faeces and drink her own urine.

The girl weighed just 70lbs when she was brought into a hospital and a doctor there told police she was under a ‘significant risk of death’ and chronic starvation caused her puberty to be arrested.

Dr Barbara Knox, of American Family 
Children's Hospital in Madison, also said the girl would be at high risk
for other disorders and complications that can lead to death, according
to an affidavit.

Investigation: Joshua Drabek, 18, was also arrested by local police for an alleged probation violation

Someone notified police after seeing the
girl barefoot in her pyjamas last Monday.

The girl claimed she fled her
home because she was afraid her stepmother was going to throw her down 
the stairs. Her stepmother and father were named by the Wisconsin State Journal as Melinda Drabek-Chritton and Chad Chritton.

The girl told police she was let out of the basement to ‘clean some papers’ for her stepmother, who became angry because she wasn't doing it fast enough and threatened to throw her down the stairs.

The couple were arrested on Friday on 
suspicion of child abuse and neglect, and a judge set their bail on 
Tuesday at $20,000 each, reported the Wisconsin State Journal.

Joshua Drabek, the girl's 18-year-old stepbrother was also arrested for an alleged probation violation, reported the newspaper.

The girl, who is not enrolled in public or private school, lived in the same house as her parents, older stepbrother and two younger stepchildren - but everyone apart from her in the home lived upstairs, reported Fox affiliate WFXS.

One doctor said the girl suffered 'serial child torture with prolonged exposure to definite starvation'. If she was ever caught eating without her parents' permission, she was 
allegedly forced to vomit it up.

A hearing was set for Thursday to review the bail and talk to the judge about the charges, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne said - adding that he can't say when charges might be filed.

she fled the house that day is it appeared this defendant was going to

The girl's father initially gave police medical explanations for her condition - but a hospital social worker told authorities there was likely much more to the case, a police spokesman said.

she fled the house that day is it appeared this defendant was going to 
throw her down the stairs,’ Assistant District Attorney Matt Moeser 
said, reported Morgan Murphy Media news website Channel 3000.

Drabek-Chritton has owned her home in Madison since 2005 and reportedly bought it from Christian affordable housing organisation Habitat for Humanity, who performed a background check of her.

The Madison Police Department is investigating a significant child abuse and neglect case involving a 15-year old girl. The amount of information being made public is limited as this case is continuing to unfold at the time of this writing.

The initial contacts with law enforcement began on the afternoon of Monday, February 6th when a passerby found the girl walking outside, without shoes or socks, clad only in pajamas. The victim was a couple of blocks from her house, and in obvious need of help. The concerned citizen notified McFarland Police who in turn summoned McFarland EMS to evaluate the malnourished teen. She was transported to a Madison hospital.

It was determined this was a Madison case. The MPD was contacted and a patrol officer responded to the hospital to gather information.

From the onset, it was clear the 70-pound girl was dramatically underweight. The child’s father provided medical explanations for her physical condition.

On Wednesday, February 8th, a hospital social worker provided information to the MPD indicating there was likely much more to the case, and the investigation escalated.

A doctor, who specializes in child abuse, examined the teen on Friday, February 10th, and diagnosed her condition as, “serial child torture with prolonged exposure to definite starvation.”

A forensic interview was conducted at 
Safe Harbor Child Advocacy Center on Friday, February 10th. The Safe 
Harbor interview provided probable cause to make 3 arrests. Late on 
Friday the child’s 40-year old father and 42-year old stepmother were 
arrested on tentative charges of Child Neglect. In addition, the 18-year
old step brother was arrested on a Probation and Parole hold.

She was forced to spend most of her time in the basement, 
without a bathroom, and being given very little to eat

In summary: Detectives learned she lived with her father, a stepmother, an adult step-brother, and two younger stepchildren. While the rest of the family resided upstairs, she was forced to spend most of her time in the basement, without a bathroom, and being given very little to eat. There was an alarm that would sound if she went upstairs.

A search warrant was executed on the family’s Southeast Side home Monday afternoon, February 13th. Potential evidence was seized. Interviews and evidence gathering continue.

The MPD has had prior calls regarding members of the family. One case, in 2007, involved the victim. An unnamed party alleged the girl may have been molested by a family member. The girl did not corroborate the allegation during the investigation by the MPD. At the time, she appeared healthy, and her family was unwilling to cooperate with a MPD detective. The detective told other involved agencies that if the child was to make future disclosures pertaining to the allegation that the detective should be contacted so the investigation could proceed. No further information was brought to the MPD.

The child is currently not enrolled in a public or private school.

The MPD is working closely with many agencies on this case.
