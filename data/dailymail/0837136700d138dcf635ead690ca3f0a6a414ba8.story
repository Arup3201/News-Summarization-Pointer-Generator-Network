This is the heartbreaking moment a four-year-old Syrian girl 'surrendered' to a photographer when she mistook the man's camera for a gun.

Taken at the Atmen refugee camp on Syria's border with Turkey last December, the image shows the young girl frozen in fear with her arms raised and her lips tightly pursed.

The child has been identified as Adi Hudea, whose father died in the 2012 Hama massacre and who has been living with her traumatised mother and three siblings at Camp Atmen ever since.

Shocking: Palestine-based photojournalist Nadia Abu Shaban tweeted the image along with the caption: 'Thought he has a weapon not a camera so she gave up'

The image was taken by Turkish photojournalist Osman Sagirli but went viral earlier this week when it was shared on social media.

Palestine-based photojournalist Nadia Abu Shaban tweeted the image along with the caption: 'Thought he has a weapon not a camera so she gave up'.

Turkish media researching the origins of the photograph later suggested Adi Hudea was a four-year-old boy, not a girl, and revealed he was a resident of the Atmen refugee in Syria.

But BBC Trending have subsequently spoken to Sagirli himself who confirmed the image shows a little girl.  

Ms Shaban's tweet has since been reposted more than 14,000 times and prompted emotional responses from social media users.

One wrote: 'I'm actually weeping seeing this. We've made this planet a horrible place, haven't we?', as another said: 'We are failing the younger generations and those still to come. SHAME ON US.'

The five-year-old Syrian Civil War has so far claimed more than 220,000 lives, including an estimated 10,000 children. 

Millions of people have been displaced by the conflict, with more than 12 million people - including five million children - still in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.  

The image emerged as the Syrian government announced plans to import 150,000 tonnes of wheat for its starving population - just weeks after saying it had no need to do so.

Despite millions of Syrians fleeing the fighting to neighbouring countries, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government is grappling with ensuring there is enough grain for all.

Trade sources say Damascus faced challenges importing sufficient stocks as payment problems and fighting have deterred many international firms from trading.

Before the war, Syria kept annual strategic stocks of around 3 million tonnes of wheat. 

The state-run General Establishment for Cereal Processing and Trade (Hoboob) has declined to give a figure for how much is left but said it is seeking 150,000 tonnes of wheat in an import tender that will close on April 13.

The announcement came three weeks after the minister of internal trade and consumer protection Hassan Safiya said an improved wheat harvest in 2015 would translate into self-sufficiency.

'We need to import to bolster our strategic stocks and have started with this tender to test the market,' a Hoboob source told Reuters.

Hoboob said the government was currently relying on its 2014 local harvest and drawing on its strategic reserves to keep its bread subsidy programme going.
