Texas Republican Rep. Steve Stockman is threatening to attempt to impeach President Barack Obama if the commander in chief uses an executive order to institute new gun control measures.

Stockman claimed that such measures would be 'unconstitutional' and therefor 'infringe on our constitutionally-protected right to keep and bear arms.'

'I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including 
but not limited to eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the
 White House, and even filing articles of impeachment,' Stockman said in
 a statement.

Obama mentioned the possibility of executive action aimed at polices to reduce gun violence at a Monday press conference.

Obama confirmed Monday that 
he is prepared to use executive orders to tighten gun controls without 
the approval of Congress.

'I'm
 confident that there are some steps that we can take that don't require
 legislation and that are within my authority as president,' Obama said 
during his final press conference of his first term. 

Obama
 is also reviewing a range of legislative actions, such as a 
'meaningful' assault weapons ban and limit to high-capacity magazines, 
he said.

Stockman, a freshman congressman who served on term in Congress in the mid-1990s called the idea 'an existential threat to this nation,' as the Second Amendment was in place to protect allow people a means to protect themselves from tyrants.

'Any proposal to abuse executive power and infringe upon gun rights 
must be repelled with the stiffest legislative force possible,' he 
added.

Ready: Obama alluded to using executive order to institute gun control during press conference Monday

'Under no circumstances whatsoever may the government take any 
action that disarms any peaceable person — much less without due process
 through an executive declaration without a vote of Congress or a ruling
 of a court.'

He further claimed such executive action would be 'not just an attack on the Constitution,' but an 'attack on Americans.'

'If the president is allowed to suspend constitutional rights on his 
own personal whims, our free republic has effectively ceased to exist,' 
he said.
