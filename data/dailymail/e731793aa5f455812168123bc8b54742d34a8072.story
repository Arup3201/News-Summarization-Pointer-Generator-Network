A retired SWAT sniper who shot a gun out of a suicidal man's hand in an incredible move that saw him deemed a 'hero' has defended the film American Sniper's protagonist, Navy SEAL Chris Kyle.

Kyle, who made 160 confirmed kills before he was shot dead by a mentally unstable soldier in 2013, was widely condemned following the movie's release because of the acts of war he had committed. 

But speaking in support of the late sniper, whose autobiography inspired the $264million global box-office sensation, Mike Plumb, who retired from SWAT in 2000, said Kyle was only doing his job.

'[The film] was good, I liked it,' said the 64-year-old. 'The point of that film is not about the number of people he killed, but it's about the lives he saved. That's why we do what we do.'

Plumb was working for special forces in Columbus, Ohio, in 1993 when he was called to a residential intersection, where suicidal Doug Conley was sitting in a plastic chair with a gun held up to his chin.

Perfect shot: In unbelievable scenes, the gun was knocked out of Conley's hands - causing a small cloud of smoke (above) - by SWAT sniper Mike Plumb, who was lying hidden on his stomach on a nearby grassy knoll

Unarmed: Conley lifts his arm in the air in shock just split-seconds after Plumb fired at his .38-caliber revolver, which was knocked out of shot. Seconds later, he reaches for the gun, but is tackled to the ground by police

While Conley threatened to kill himself and waved the .38-caliber revolver at gathered police officers and passing drivers, Plumb made his way to a spot on a nearby grassy knoll, hidden by pine trees. 

Once there, he laid flat on his stomach and watched as the 37-year-old depressed man screamed at officers - whom he had engaged in a stand-off for two hours - that he wanted to see his ex-girlfriend. 

All the while, Plumb, now 64, had the scope of his Austrian-made Steyr SSG PII black sniper rifle focused on Conley, who was around 82 yards away, according to The Columbus Dispatch.

Several minutes later, as Conley looked around impatiently for his former girlfriend with one hand on his left knee and the other wielding the revolver, Plumb was given the order: 'Go ahead and do it.'

So, he lined up the shot, squeezed the trigger and fired. In unbelievable scenes, the bullet struck the tip of the loaded gun, knocking it out of Conley's hands while completely missing his body.

Surveillance footage shows the suicidal man staring shocked at his weapon as it lies on the floor, several feet away. Seconds later, he reaches for the gun, but is tackled to the ground by police. 

Stand-off: During the incident in August 1993,  37-year-old Conley (seen holding the gun to his chin) screamed at officers - whom he had engaged in a stand-off for two hours - that he wanted to see his former girlfriend

Scene: As Conley (pictured in the chair from behind) looked around impatiently for his former girlfriend with one hand on his left knee and the other wielding the revolver, Plumb was given the order: 'Go ahead and do it'

'Hero': 'My idea was hit it right where that cylinder snaps in, break the gun into pieces, take the cylinder out and, you know, disable the weapon. Game over,' Plumb (pictured at the SWAT headquarters last week) said

As officers secured a pair of handcuffs to his wrists, Conley simply said: 'That was a great shot.'

Speaking of his perfect shot, which almost certainly saved Conley's life, last week, Plumb, who was in his early forties at the time of the incident, said he knew exactly what he wanted to achieve.

'My idea was hit it right where that cylinder snaps in, break the gun into pieces, take the cylinder out and, you know, disable the weapon. Game over,' Plumb, who had previously fired only at distant range targets, such as pieces of fruit, during SWAT practice sessions, told the newspaper.

'I heard over the radio, I had an earpiece in, the lieutenant said 'go ahead and do it'.' So that's when I pulled the earpiece out, let it lie there, zeroed in on where I thought he was going to put the gun. 

'I adjusted myself probably a couple of inches or so, if that, and lined it up and just made my trigger squeeze. And it happened. It was a nice ending to what could have been a very, very bad situation.' 

Framed: Following the incident, Plumb was quickly dubbed a 'hero' and 'the best dude' by his colleagues - but he has not let the notoriety get to his head. Above, the gun he fired at remains framed at SWAT's offices

Weapon: 'I couldn't have done what I did unless all the men did their jobs and did what they were supposed to do. They afforded me the time to train with that rifle,' Plumb said. Above, his rifle is also framed at the offices

New job: Plum, who retired from special forces in 2000, currently works as Columbus's facility security manager (pictured) in 2007, protecting neighborhoods and city employees. He is set to retire in March

Following the incident in August 1993, Plumb was quickly dubbed a 'hero' and 'the best dude' by his colleagues, especially because no Columbus police sniper had ever fired a shot in the line of duty.

He also made headlines around the world. Indeed, the footage of the incident has been viewed more than 8million times on YouTube, despite the incident having happened before the Internet took off.

But Plumb has not let his 'notoriety' get to his head - he maintains he was just doing his job. 

'I couldn't have done what I did unless all the men did their jobs and did what they were supposed to do. They afforded me the time to train with that rifle. I just did what I was supposed to do,' he said.

Shot dead: Kyle (pictured), who made 160 confirmed kills before he was shot dead by a mentally unstable soldier in 2013, was widely condemned following American Sniper release because of his acts of war

Film: Actor Bradley Cooper (pictured alongside Sienna Miller) plays Kyle in the Clint Eastwood-directed movie

Paying tribute to the former sniper - whose rifle remains framed at the city's SWAT offices alongside the gun he fired at - Mayor Michael Coleman described him as 'one of the best of the best'. 

Conley, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of inducing panic, was sentenced to two years' probation. He has since lived in Tennessee, Florida and Ohio. His current location is unknown. 

Since its cinematic release on January 16, American Sniper  has gained millions of fans, including Michelle Obama, who said it 'touches on the emotions and experiences' of many military families.

However, it has also weathered a growing storm of criticism, including from the likes of director Michael Moore, because of the acts of war committed by Kyle and its portrayal of Islamic people.

Actor Bradley Cooper plays Kyle in the movie.
