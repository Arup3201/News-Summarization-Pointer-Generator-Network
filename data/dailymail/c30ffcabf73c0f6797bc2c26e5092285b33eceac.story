Forget a slim waist, great legs or glowing skin, the one thing that I have always coveted most in other women is smooth, shiny hair.

At 44, I have spent most of my life battling my thick, frizzy mane — hair that, left to its own devices, would grow upwards and outwards, instead of down.

I can still recall the blow-dry that changed my life: it was 1982, I was 13 and blissfully unaware that I had the bad hair gene. But that afternoon, my hairdresser produced a paddle brush and proceeded to blow-dry my hair straight. As shiny, smooth tendrils suddenly skimmed my collarbones, I had an epiphany: for the first time, I felt pretty.

From frizzy to fabulous: Anna now has the sleek hair she's always yearned for

Ever since, I have devoted time and money to recreate that feeling, spending 90 minutes (though that time has more than halved) blow-drying my hair straight.

I was convinced — still am — that people take me less seriously with my natural all-over-the-place curls, and when I have sleek hair, I exude a calmer, confident allure.

What makes hair frizzy? Blame it partly on family, partly on environment. Mine was inherited from my coarse-haired Greek parents, and doubles in size in humidity and damp weather. I’ve been known to leave the house in a beanie hat, even in summer.

‘Even if hair has been blow-dried, as soon as moisture enters cuticles, the outermost layer, strands behave as they would naturally — in your case, twisting instead of lying straight,’ says trichologist Philip Kingsley. ‘There’s no cure for frizz, you can only use products to calm it.’

Believe me, over the past 31 years, I have tried every treatment and product. Some may not be cheap, others may not be easy, but as anyone with the frizzy gene will know, if they work, it’s worth it.

Natural look: Anna aged 12

I once left a salon looking like Cousin It from the Addams Family after a stylist said ‘all one length’ would help my hair drop (it didn’t). Another time, I emerged with more flicky-out layers than Lawrence Llewelyn-Bowen, and once, I went for a blunt fringe that left me looking like one of The Beatles.Then I met Tom Tsang at Smiths Salon in London’s Soho. He gently, and I mean gently, layered my hair in a way that thinned out all thickness, letting it fall evenly.‘Ask your hairdresser for long, soft layers with volume at the bottom,’ he says. ‘Tell them to cut texture in to combat “poofiness”, leaving layers with gentle movement.’

Harsh, cheap shampoos add to frizz, making hair coarser by upsetting the lay of the cuticle. Look for products free from sulphates, harsh detergents that make hair brittle and stiff. The best I have used is Pureology’s Super Smooth range, (shampoo, £13.86; conditioner £17.85), which also protects hair from frizz-aggravating UV damage.

If I could take one hair product to a deserted island, it would be Bumble and Bumble Tonic Lotion, (£16). Even when my hair is due a cut, a few sprays of this when it’s wet will smooth instantly. Menthol and peppermint extracts prevent roots getting oily and it’s alcohol-free: great news, as alcohol increases frizz.

Moroccan Oil burst on the scene to cult status about ten years ago. Argan oil is its best-known ingredient, but it also contains silicone polymers which calm frizz and protect from humidity. I apply it to towel-dried hair. I never use it on dry hair as it makes it greasy.

Bad hair gene: Anna, (aged 19) would spend up to 90 minutes trying to tame her curls

I discovered Kerastase Fluide Oleo-Relax Slim Cream (£17.90) on a trip away with a sleek-haired friend who I would never have guessed was prone to frizz, till I saw her post-swim. A touch of this balm and her hair dried naturally into soft curls. The secret is scarcity. Too much will weigh hair down.

It's expensive, but as a finisher on dry hair, nothing beats Alterna’s Caviar CC Cream (£21.20). In the same way a CC face cream evens out skin, this smooths flyaways and helps stop the puffy ‘helmet effect’ my blow-dry gets on humid days.

I worship the paddle brush as it creates soft, breezy, straight hair. The standard is available from most brush shops, but I recently discovered the Kent AirHedz Pro (£10.20). The natural bristles are thick and hard, gripping hair for faster blow-dries, leaving a silkier result.

I’m not a fan of straightening irons, as I find results short-lived, leaving hair straw-like. But I am a fan of ionic hair-dryers, as they emit negative ions which help the cuticle lie flat, giving that glossy effect. They cause water in wet hair to break down faster. Celebrity hairdresser Errol Douglas’s Infrared Dryer (£59.99) cut my straightening time from 25 to 15 minutes. Result.

Coarse hair can often look dull from too much heat and product overload. My antidote is Palmer’s Coconut Oil Formula Strong Roots (£3.49), which adds gloss without weight. I stole the secret for this cheap beauty find from a make-up artist who not only uses it to spruce up coarse hair, but also to give skin a moisturised and radiant look.

I feel pretty! After 31 years of searching Anna has found her frizzy hair's holy grail

Brazilian blow-dries, in which a straightening solution is painted on hair, have been hailed as the ultimate anti-frizz remedy. They are controversial as their active ingredient formaldehyde (used in embalming), can be carcinogenic if inhaled in large quantities.

But I discovered a formaldehyde-free alternative — the Permanent Blow-Dry — at Hershesons, a top salon at Harvey Nichols in London. The £220 treatment uses a solution with natural keratin (the protein hair is made of) and glycolic acid (used in skincare). Research found it reduces frizz as it penetrates hair shafts and rebuilds keratin semi-permanently.

Stylist Jenna Norman promises it will leave 70 per cent wave, but remove 100 per cent frizz. My hair was washed twice then blow-dried about 80 per cent dry, before being coated in a thick, white substance. It was left for 20 minutes then blow-dried, with the product in, before a once over with a straightening iron.

The result was straight locks, which I was told not to ‘dent’ or wet for three days. By day three, my hair was so greasy, I couldn’t go out. But on the fourth, I shampooed and let my hair dry naturally: it dried with a gentle wave, and zero frizz.

My picture for this piece was taken that day. Since then I have been caught in rain, sweated in the gym and not had to blow-dry my hair or go near it with a straightening iron.

My hair is swishy and shiny with no effort, save a little towel-drying. Best of all, the effects should last around five months. After 30 years of searching, I’ve found my frizzy hair’s holy grail.
