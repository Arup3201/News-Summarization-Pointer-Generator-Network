Thousands of women could benefit from a new fertility treatment designed to help those with low body fat to start a family without IVF.

The hormonal treatment is aimed at fitness fanatics who struggle with infertility due to their ultra-active lifestyles.

It could also help female athletes who are forced to take a break from training if they want to try for a baby.

But critics fear it could encourage women who are dangerously underweight or anorexic to start a pregnancy they cannot healthily maintain.

Hypothalamic amenorrhoea – which affects one in 100 women but one in ten female athletes, ballerinas and gymnasts – occurs among women who have lost a large amount of body fat due to dieting or intensive exercise.

Energy is diverted away from maintaining the reproductive system so periods stop and women are unable to conceive naturally.

The new treatment involves injecting the hormone kisspeptin to kick-start the reproductive process without the need to take a break from exercise.

One of the doctors leading the research, Dr Channa Jayasena of Imperial College London, said: ‘In the short term, infusions of kisspeptin can restore the pulses of luteinising hormone essential for female fertility. It could provide an attractive and less costly alternative to IVF.’

But although welcoming the research, a Society for Endocrinology spokesman warned of possible risks. ‘Women who exercise intensely stop their periods for a good reason: their bodies are not ready for the huge amount of energy needed to take an embryo through a pregnancy to a healthy baby without stealing energy stores from the mother. 

‘If this technique was used in women with anorexia they could conceive, but we don’t know how well the baby would develop or if it would harm the mother.’
