Bumping into an ex can be an awkward experience, but Chelsy Davy is clearly not worried about the inevitable incident tomorrow.

The young Zimbabwean, 27, who dated Prince Harry for six years, is to be chief bridesmaid at a high profile society wedding tomorrow in Northumberland.... and Harry will be there too.

Tom van Straubenzee, 30, is one of the Prince's oldest friends, and will marry the Duke of Northumberland's second daughter, Lady Melissa Percy, 26, at Alnwick Castle.

And Harry will be there himself with his current flame, Cressida Bonas, 24, with whom he is apparently madly in love, alongside 500 invited guests.

Chelsy will walk down the aisle with Lady Melissa and her sister Lady Catherine, followed by 12 pages and bridesmaids.

Following a church service with the 
Bishop of Newcastle, the bride and groom will process through Alnwick in
a horse-drawn carriage for a reception and fireworks at the castle, which appeared as Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft in the Harry Potter films.

Prince William, 31 today, will also be attending: he is performing best man duties alongside nightclub owner Guy Pelly.

But the Duke's wife the Duchess of Cambridge has been forced to pull out of attending the society wedding of the year amid fears she could go into labour.

Pregnant Kate, 31, and her husband were expected to be guests of honour at the wedding. But while her due date is still some weeks off, the Duchess has decided not to risk the 300-mile drive to the North East.

'The birth may be a few weeks off, but there is still a very slim risk she could go into labour,' a source told The Sun.

'Kate is gutted - as are Tom and Melissa - but she decided not to take any chances.'

The couple will tie the knot at Alnwick Castle, near Newcastle, which doubled as Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films, tomorrow. The parish church is close to her family's ancestral home.

The bride will leave Alnwick in a restored horse-drawn carriage that is almost 200 years old.

After the 5pm service, a reception will be held in the castle's State Rooms, followed by dinner in a marquee.

There will be fireworks in the evening which the public can watch from the Pastures below the castle.

Soon after the wedding, Lady 
Melissa's dress will be displayed alongside her sister Katie's wedding 
dress in The Coach House at Alnwick Castle.
