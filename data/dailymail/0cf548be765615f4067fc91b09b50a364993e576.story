She may not be accustomed to the daily commute or competing with throngs of passengers to get on a packed Tube train at the end of the day.

But fascinating archive images show that Her Majesty is no stranger to the London Underground - having once driven a train herself.

The incredible images of the day the Queen took the controls of a Tube train have been published to celebrate the 150th birthday of the London Underground.

Historic: Fascinating pictures show the Queen at the controls of a Victoria Line train as she opened the line in 1969. The images are part of a British Pathe gallery launched to celebrate 150 years of the London Underground

In charge:The Queen's visit underground in 1969 was her second time experiencing the Tube. Her first trip came as a 13-year-old in 1939 with Princess Margaret and her governess Marion Crawford

Going underground: The Queen was pictured riding on an escalator in the British Pathe footage filmed at Green Park station in 1969

Comfortable: As well as driving the train, the Queen is featured relaxing in one of the Victoria Line carriages in the British Pathe film from 1969

Modern technology: The Queen is pictured examining brand new automatic ticket machines on her visit to Green Park station to open the Victoria Line in 1969

They are from the archive of newsreel company British Pathe, which has published a gallery of images to coincide with the opening of the first part of the network back in 1863.

The photos show the Queen opening the Victoria Line in 1969 and taking the controls of a train at Green Park, the closest stop to her Buckingham Palace home.

The newsreel narrator says: 'Her Majesty inspected the automatic controls of one of the line’s 34 silver trains, then pressed the buttons which sent the loco in motion. That’s all the driver has to do. Computers do the rest.

'The Queen stayed at the controls for the short journey between Green Park and Oxford Circus.'

Her Majesty was also seen in the video relaxing in one of the trains carriages, using one of the station's escalators and inspecting new ticket machines.

It was the Queen's second trip underground, the first had come in 1939 when she was 13 with her governess Marion Crawford and Princess Margaret.

It would not be the last time that The Queen would ride in the driver's cab of an Underground train.

Although not at the controls this time, she rode at the front of a train again in 1977 as she opened up part of an extension to the Picadilly Line and travelled between Hatton Cross and Heathrow on the train.

Her most recent trip underground was a visit to Aldgate station in 2010, to view a plaque in honour of those killed in the July 7 bombings in 2005.

As well as the Royal video, British Pathe's gallery includes a wartime newsreel from 1944 which features women known as 'fluffies' cleaning the Underground tunnels during the night.

Hard work: A woman is pictured scrubbing the Underground track in 1944 with a cigarette in her mouth. The group of women, known as 'fluffies' were supervised by a male manager

Incredibly, they are shown crawling on their hands and knees cleaning between tracks as a man supervises.

Footage also shows the key role the London Underground played during the Second World War.

Poignant images of Londoners taking shelter in stations during the Blitz is featured.

A clip from 
1946, meanwhile, shows men wearing bowler hats riding a new section of 
the Central Line from Liverpool Street to Stratford, footage that 
featured in the London Olympics Opening Ceremony more than 60 years on.

A
 British Pathe spokesman said: 'There are some wonderful films in the 
archive on women war workers cleaning the Tube lines at night - it 
doesn’t look fun.

Latest visit: The Queen pictured at Aldgate station in 2010. During this visit she spoke with station staff and visited a memorial to those killed in the 7/7 bombings

'There’s also coverage of new 
construction and the alterations made to the tunnels during the Blitz, 
all of which makes for fascinating viewing.'

The
 first stretch of the Tube, the Metropolitan or Met line as it was 
known, opened on January 9 1863 and was the world's first underground 
railway.

The first 
stretch of track was just 6km in length - tiny in comparison to the 
408km of track used today - and ran between Bishop's Road and Farringdon
 Street.

Streets were dug up, a track laid in a trench and a brick tunnel built around it before relaying the road in the early days.

Stop: Arnos Grove Underground station, which is on the Picadilly Line and was opened in 1932, is pictured in the 1960s

But that method was dropped in the late 19th century because of the hold ups it caused overground.

By Christmas 1868, another line had opened between Westminster and South Kensington and were linked to a branch of the original Met, making up what we now know as the Circle Line by 1884.

Around three million passengers use the Underground every day in 2013, with 275 operating stations across the capital.

A lot has changed since the Queen was filmed opening the Victoria Line in 1969 - as well as a host of technilogical advances, the introduction of the Oyster card, penalty fares and a host of new safety measures, five stations have closed, including Blake hall, Ongar and North Weald, while a further eight stations no longer operate Underground services.
