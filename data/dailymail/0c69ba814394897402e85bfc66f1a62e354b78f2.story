George Paskins, 81, was convicted of repeatedly raping three young girls during 16-year abuse

A pensioner who preyed on young girls in a 16-year long campaign of abuse has been jailed for 18 years.

George Paskins from Paignton, Devon, began regularly raping one girl when she was just three and another when was eight in 1965 and was found guilty by a jury on his 81st birthday.

A court heard that he was so relaxed during his abuse that on one occasion he even paused to make a cup of tea and another described how he used a comic to cover her face.

One of the victims was repeatedly raped between the ages of three and four until the age of 10 or 11 while the abuse started at the age of eight for second girl and ended when she was 11.

A third girl was also indecently assaulted, although Paskins swore 'on the Holy Bible' that he did not touch any of the girls.

Recorder Paul Dunkels at Plymouth Crown Court said Paskins was a 'bully' who used violence and threats to make sure the girls never complained.

He told the pensioner: 'Undoubtedly the two girls who were raped suffered serious psychological trauma.

'One of the girls was extremely young when you began to rape her.'

All three victims, two via videolink from Australia, bravely spoke of the casual and perverse brutality they suffered at the hands of Paskins up until 1981. 

The former carpenter and joiner told the week-long trial his victims should be punished for fabricating claims against him. 

'I have never touched them,' he said. 'To me, it is a terrible thing that they have done. I think they should be punished.' 

Paskins was convicted of raping the first victim three times between 1965 and 1977 and the second girl three times between 1970 and 1975.

He was given another two years concurrent for indecent assault of the third girl and 12 months for indecency with her, and is expected to spend nine years behind bars - taking him to the age of 90.

Neither he, nor his wife at the back of the court, showed any reaction when the foreman announced the verdicts.
