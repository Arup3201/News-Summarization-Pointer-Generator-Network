Thousands of heavily-trafficked bridges around the U.S. may be one accident or mistake away from collapse, even if the spans are deemed structurally sound, officials warned today.

The crossings are kept standing by engineering design, not supported with brute strength or redundant protections like their more modern counterparts. Bridge regulators call the more risky spans 'fracture critical' meaning that if a single, vital component of the bridge is compromised, it can crumple.

Those vulnerable crossings carry millions of drivers every day. In Boston, a six-lane highway 1A near Logan airport includes a 'fracture critical' bridge over Bennington Street. In northern Chicago, an I-90 pass that goes over Ashland Avenue is in the same category, as is an I-880 bridge over 5th Avenue in Oakland, California.

Also on that list is the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River north of Seattle, which collapsed into the water days ago after officials say an over-sized truck load clipped the steel truss.

Public officials have focused in recent years on the desperate need for money to repair thousands of bridges deemed structurally deficient, which typically means a major portion of the bridge is in poor condition or worse. 

But the bridge that collapsed Thursday is not in that deficient category, highlighting another major problem with the nation's infrastructure: although it's rare, some bridges deemed to be fine structurally can still be crippled if they are struck hard enough in the wrong spot.

'It probably is a bit of a fluke in that sense,' said Charles Roeder, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington.

While the I-5 truck's cargo suffered only minimal damage, it left chaos in its wake, with two vehicles catapulting off the edge of the broken bridge into the river below. Three people involved escaped with non-life threatening injuries.

Officials asked people to plan for an 
extra hour to make their way through detours around the collapsed 
bridge. There are three detour options northbound and two options 
southbound.

About 71,000 vehicles use that 
stretch of highway every day. Late Saturday morning, traffic was moving 
freely through the detours.

Officials were looking for a 
temporary, pre-fabricated bridge to replace the 160-foot section that 
failed, Governor Jay Inslee said Friday. That option could be in place 
in weeks. Otherwise, it could be months before a replacement can be 
built, the governor said.

Inslee said it will cost $15 million 
to repair the bridge. The federal government has promised $1 million in 
emergency dollars and more money could come later, according to 
Washington's congressional delegation.

The Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board Debbie Hersman and her team
will spend a week to 10 days looking at the bridge, talking to the 
truck driver whose vehicle hit it, and examining maintenance documents 
and previous accident reports.

They'll be watching for safety issues that could affect other bridges.

Washington
state officials said Saturday that it will take time to find both 
short- and long-term fixes for the bridge that collapsed on Interstate 
5.

The most famous failure of a fracture
critical bridge was the collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis 
during rush hour on Aug. 1, 2007, killing 13 people and injuring more 
than 100 others. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that
the cause of the collapse was an error by the bridge's designers — a 
gusset plate, a key component of the bridge, was too thin. The plate was
only half of the required one-inch thickness

Because
the bridge's key structures lacked redundancy, where if one piece 
fails, there is another piece to prevent the bridge from falling, when 
the gusset plate broke, much of the bridge collapsed.

Mark
Rosenker, who was chairman of the NTSB during the I-35W bridge 
investigation, said the board looked into whether other fracture 
critical bridges were collapsing. They found a few cases, but not many, 
he said.

'Today, they're still building fracture critical bridges with the belief that they're not going break,' Rosenker said.

Fracture critical bridges, like the 
I-5 span in Washington, are the result of Congress trying to cut corners
to save money rather than a lack of engineering know-how, said Barry B.
LePatner, a New York real estate attorney and author of 'Too Big to 
Fall: America's Failing Infrastructure and the Way Forward.'

About 18,000 fracture 
critical bridges were built from the mid-1950s through the late 1970s in
an effort to complete the nation's interstate highway system, which was
launched under President Dwight Eisenhower, LePatner said in an 
interview. The fracture critical bridge designs were cheaper than 
bridges designed with redundancy, he said.

Thousands of those bridges remain in use, according to an AP analysis.

'They
have been left hanging with little maintenance for four decades now,' 
he said. 'There is little political will and less political leadership 
to commit the tens of billions of dollars needed' to fix them.

There
has been little focus or urgency in specifically replacing the older 
'fracture critical' crossings, in part because there is a massive 
backlog of bridge repair work for thousands of bridges deemed to be 
structurally problematic. Washington state Rep. Judy Clibborn, a 
Democrat who leads the House transportation committee, has been trying 
to build support for a tax package to pay for major transportation 
projects in the state. But her plan wouldn't have done anything to 
revamp the bridge that collapsed.

National bridge records say the I-5 
crossing over the Skagit River had a sufficiency rating of 57.4 out of 
100 — a score designed to gauge the ability of the bridge to remain in 
service. To qualify for federal replacement funds, a bridge must have a 
rating of 50 or below. A bridge must have a sufficiency rating of 80 or 
below to qualify for federal rehabilitation funding.

Hundreds
of bridges in Washington state have worse ratings than the one that 
collapsed, and many around the country have single-digit ratings.

Clibborn
said the Skagit River crossing wasn't even on the radar of lawmakers 
because state officials have to prioritize by focusing on bridges with 
serious structural problems that are at higher risk of imminent danger.

Along
with being at risk of a fatal impact, the I-5 bridge was deemed to be 
'functionally obsolete,' which essentially means it wasn't built to 
today's standards. Its shoulders were narrow, and it had low clearance.

There
are 66,749 structurally deficient bridges and 84,748 functionally 
obsolete bridges in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, according to the 
Federal Highway Administration. That's about a quarter of the 607,000 
total bridges nationally. States and cities have been whittling down 
that backlog, but slowly. In 2002, about 30 percent of bridges fell into
one of those two categories

There is wide recognition at all levels of government that the failure to address aging infrastructure will likely undermine safety and hinder economic growth. But there is no consensus on how to pay for improvements. The federal Highway Trust Fund, which provides construction aid to states, is forecast to go broke next year. The fund gets its revenue primarily from federal gas and diesel taxes. But revenues aren't keeping up because people are driving less and there are more fuel-efficient cars on the road.

Neither Congress nor the White House has shown any willingness to raise federal gas taxes, which haven't been increased since 1993. Many transportation thinkers believe a shift to taxes based on miles traveled by a vehicle is inevitable, but there are privacy concerns and other difficulties that would preclude widespread use of such a system for at least a decade.

Transportation spending got a temporary boost with the economic stimulus funds approved by Congress after President Barack Obama was elected. Of the $27 billion designated for highway projects under the stimulus program, about $3 billion went to bridge projects, Black said.

States are looking for other means to raise money for highway and bridge improvements, including more road tolls, dedicating a portion of sales taxes to transportation and raising state gas taxes. Clibborn, the Washington state lawmaker, has proposed a 10-cent gas hike to help pay for projects, though the effort has been held up by a dispute over how to rebuild the Columbia River bridge connecting Vancouver, Washington, and Portland, Oregon.

'We can't possibly do it all in the next 10 years,' Clibborn said. 'But we're going to do the first bite of the apple.'
