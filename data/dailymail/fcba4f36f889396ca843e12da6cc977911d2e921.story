Legal highs are becoming a bigger problem than cocaine and heroin in Britain, a Home Office minister claimed today.

Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes in East Sussex, revealed his concern over the dozens of young people who are dying or risking injury by experimenting with new substances.

It comes after the 56-year-old said ministers were refusing to sign up to European legislation for tackling the legal highs because the proposal would restrict Britain’s ability to control the drugs.

A review of legal highs was launched last month by Mr Baker, who joined the Home Office in the last reshuffle, to consider widening legislation to boost police and law enforcement agencies' powers.

He said some legal highs could be ‘more dangerous’ than heroin or cocaine, telling the London Evening Standard: ‘People think they are safe and legal when they may not be.

‘So I have initiated a review of so-called legal highs, which are a particular problem at the moment and becoming more serious than some of the traditional drugs in many ways.’

Mr Baker added: ‘We don’t know what the long-term consequences of these things are. They are more of a problem because we don’t know what they are until we have analysed them.’

He said that the Government has decades of history about the effects of cocaine and heroin, which has helped them to come up with a policy - but no such knowledge exists about some legal highs.

The politician also stated that young people whose 
bladders were being destroyed by the controlled drug ketamine - a horse 
tranquilliser - were now being forced to have colostomy bags fitted.

Mr Baker pointed out that he did wish to say heroin and cocaine were not dangerous.

More than 50 deaths each year are blamed on legal highs by campaigners, including that of Adam Hunt, 18, who took the psychoactive substances AMT and etizolam in Southampton last August.

Sussex University medical student Hester 
Stewart, 21, was also killed by a legal high. The cheerleader took the 
dance drug GBL in April 2009 and was later found dead at a house in 
Brighton.

Mr Baker said earlier this week that the Government also disputes European Union evidence, which estimates 20 per cent of legal highs have a ‘legitimate use’.

Mr Baker said the Government would remain involved in EU negotiations to shape the European Commission proposals.

Ten ‘legal highs’ were identified last year for the first time in the UK by a specialist Government system that targets music festivals and tobacco shops.

A total of 27 new psychoactive substances, also known as legal highs, have now been detected by the Home Office's Forensic Early Warning System since it was set up in January 2011.

Official figures also show that the number of deaths being linked to legal highs soared by 80 per cent last year to 52, from 29 in 2011.
