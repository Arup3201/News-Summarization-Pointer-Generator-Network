A German national has been charged in federal court with sneaking onto a container ship in California in the hopes of catching a ride to South Korea to be with his pregnant wife.

According to court documents, on September 21st Andreas Guenther rowed in an inflatable raft through the Port of Oakland to the Cosco Oceania.

He was able to board the ship undetected at 2:30 am, but was discovered by crew members a short time later and removed by the Coast Guard. 

He told the Coast Guard that he attempted the voyage because his passport had expired, and he did not want to wait to get a new one.

The 2008-built Hong Kong-registered vessel is 1,145ft long and has a gross tonnage of 115,776 tonnes, according to Vesselfinder.com. 

The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Tuesday that Guenther's story has changed since his initial interview by the Coast Guard. Originally he told them that he had purchased a $5,000 visitor pass for the ship from a man named 'Li', and that a friend had taken him to the ship.

Two months later his story changed and he said that he had made his own way to the ship and that he had bought a $500 'vessel pass' from a man in San Francisco's Chinatown.

The punishment for being a stowaway is a fine or up to five years in prison.

Information on the website of the German Consulate in San Francisco states that passports can be renewed by appointment with between one and nine weeks' notice.
