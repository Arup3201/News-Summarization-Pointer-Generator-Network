Enjoying the great outdoors has spawned an entire market catering for campers who want to enjoy a hearty meal without overloading their rucksack.

Camping shops now sell a whole range of dried, lightweight foods - from all day breakfasts to chicken tikka masalas.

But now a new - and some might say revolutionary - addition to their food shelf has been added: Dried beer.

The beer sachets will launch in the Canada and U.S. in September but it is hoped that the portable drink will be available in Europe soon

A U.S. brewer has managed to create a concentrate that simply requires water being added and carbonated shortly before it is drunk.

Pat's Backcountry Beverages has managed to create a near waterless formulation that claims to offer all the taste, aroma and alcohol of the traditional beverage.

After water is added it must be carbonated with a simple gadget

Sam Hobbs, director of sales at the 
company, told MailOnline that while the beer is not yet on sale, it will 
soon be available to the public: 'We're hoping to launch it early to 
mid-September and it should costs around $9.95 (£6.44) for a four pack.'

The beer will be available in the U.S. and Canada but they have plans to expand their business.

'We definitely want to offer our 
products to the UK and the rest of Europe eventually, but I can't say when 
that will be at the moment.'

The website explains that unlike other concentrate processes, their concentrate is not simply a case of brewing the beer and then removing the water afterwards.

Instead, their patent-pending process enables brewers to start with almost no water, and carefully control the environment of the fermentation.

Mr Hobbs' lips were tightly sealed when probed about the precise nature of the process however.

The carbonation system costs $39.95 (£25.84)  and is light and easily portable.

When the sachets are launched, each will make one pint of beer.

There will also be two flavours -  one will be a pale ale and the other will be a black ale.
