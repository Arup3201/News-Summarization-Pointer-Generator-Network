At 95, an elderly man from Denmark is still able to lift weights that most people a quarter of his age wouldn't be able to budge from the ground.

Even more astonishingly, it was only two-and-a-half years ago that powerlifter Svend Stensgaard was rushed to hospital after having a heart attack.

Yet a video filmed of him working out at the gym - in a room full of boys young enough to be his great-grandchildren - proves just how fit and healthy he is in later life.

In the footage, the jacked Dane defies stereotypes of pensioners as frail and feeble beings clad in their bedroom slippers.

Both standing and lying on his back, he is seen shifting a whopping 290 pounds of weight as he controls his breathing to establish a rhythm.

Mr Stensgaard says in the interview that exercising, which releases a lot of stress-fighting endorphins, is comparable to a 'dosage of morphine' for him.

Superman! The pensioner suffered a heart attack more than two years ago but that has not stopped him from doing what he loves the most

He explains that those closest to him are 'very impressed and also amazed' that he has continued to train despite his recent health troubles.

'I could barely lift more than 1kg in each hand,' he recalls. 'And so to add to their admiration, I lifted 130 kg in a deadlift.'

At the end of the video, Mr Stensgaard adds that he was born to do this and has no plans to stop despite growing older.

It gives him something pleasurable to do and look forward to.

'For me, I exercise because I can't think of myself sitting at home and doing nothing.'
