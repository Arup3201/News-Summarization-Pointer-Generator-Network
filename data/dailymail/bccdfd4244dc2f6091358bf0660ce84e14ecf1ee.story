Thousands of lives could be saved every year if all British smokers switched from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, experts have said.

Researchers from University College London (UCL) estimated that for every million smokers who switch from tobacco to electronic cigarettes, more than 6,000 premature deaths would be prevented each year in the UK.

There are currently around nine million British smokers.

If they all switched to nicotine vapour inhalers, ditching their traditional tobacco products, the scientists predict around 54,000 lives could be saved.

Researchers from University College London (UCL) estimated if the nine million British smokers all switched to e-cigarettes instead of traditional tobacco, around 54,000 lives could be saved

The study claims that the reduced risk of death takes into account the possibility that e-cigarettes may carry an increased risk of death. 

But the chief executive of the British Lung Foundation today made an urgent call for more research into the effects of e-cigarettes in the face of countless conflicting views. 

Dr Penny Woods, told MailOnline: 'We are constantly hearing conflicting views around e-cigarettes and we can appreciate that the public are confused about whether the use of e-cigarettes is recommended.

'This is why we are urgently calling for more research into the health impact of electronic-cigarettes and whether they effectively help smokers quit their habit.'

The latest study comes just days after a piece of research published by a team at the University of South Carolina, warned of higher levels of 'harmful and dangerous toxins' in e-cigarettes compared with traditional products.

Their findings concluded that e-cigarette vapour contains the toxic element chromium, as well as four times more nickel than is found in normal cigarettes. 

The researchers also found the devices contained lead, zinc and other toxic metals, although in lower levels than cigarettes.

But in an editorial published in the British Journal of General Practice, Professor Robert West and Dr Jamie Brown from UCL’s Department of Epidemiology and Public Health have argued that even though some toxins are present in the vapour from e-cigarettes the concentrations are ‘very low’.

The editorial said: ‘The vapour contains nothing like the concentrations of carcinogens and toxins as cigarette smoke.

‘In fact, toxin concentrations are almost all well below 1/20th that of cigarette smoke.’

Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, today called for urgent research in the face of countless conflicting studies in to the effects of e-cigarettes.

'We are constantly hearing conflicting views around e-cigarettes and we can appreciate that the public are confused about whether the use of e-cigarettes is recommended,' she said.

'This is why we are urgently calling for more research into the health impact of electronic-cigarettes and whether they effectively help smokers quit their habit. 

'Once we have this research we can understand, based on factual evidence, whether e-cigarettes could provide an efficient route to stopping smoking and save thousands of lives.

'Until then, we recommend that people trying to quit smoking first use approved nicotine replacement therapies.'

The World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a report advising that the use of e-cigarettes should be banned indoors and all advertising stopped until the industry produces ‘convincing supporting scientific evidence and obtains regulatory approval’.

The British Medical Association (BMA) backed this call. 

Ram Moorth, deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s board of science, said tight controls are needed so that they aren't aggressively marketed towards young people and so that their sale doesn't normalise the act of smoking.

But Professor Ward and Dr Brown moved to dispel the idea.

They argued that a rise in the use of e-cigarettes has been accompanied by an increase in the numbers of smokers quitting and a continued fall in the numbers of people that smoke.

Meanwhile the number of e-cigarette users who took up the habit having never smoked in the past is ‘extremely small’, they added.

They wrote: ‘There are a number of public health advocates who appear to consider electronic cigarettes primarily as a threat to public health, and bodies such as the British Medical Association and the WHO are warning smokers about their potential dangers.

‘Given that smokers smoke primarily for the nicotine but die primarily from the tar, one might imagine that e-cigarettes would be welcomed as a means to prevent much of the death and suffering caused by cigarettes.’

A WHO-commisisoned report on e-cigarettes released in 2013, before their recent call for further restrictions on the use, sale and promotion of cigarettes, has also come under attack.

The December 2013 report said that e-cigarette use is a major problem among young people and could be acting as a gateway to smoking.

It inferred that bystanders can inhale significant levels of toxins and said that the products actually inhibit smoking cessation.

Writing in the journal Addiction, experts called the report is ‘misleading’.

Lead author Professor Ann McNeill from the National Addiction Centre at King’s College London, said: ‘We were surprised by the negativity of the commissioned review, and found it misleading and not an accurate reflection of available evidence.

‘E-cigarettes are new and we certainly don’t yet have all the answers to their long-term health impact, but what we do know is that they are much safer than cigarettes, which kill over six million people a year worldwide.’

 The researchers argued that rise in use of e-cigarettes has been accompanied by an increase in the numbers of smokers quitting and a continued fall in the numbers of people that smoke

The authors said that the global health body took on the general tone of the recommendations set out in the report - even though concerns had been raised about it by scientists and other public health experts about them.

But one of the authors of the latest report, Professor Peter Hajek, from the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University of London, said: ’The WHO report published last week copies these recommendations almost verbatim. 

'I think these type of recommendations are actually detrimental to public health.

‘The purpose of these recommendations to restrict the use of e-cigarettes and the reason for doing that is to avoid risk. 

'I think any responsible regulator proposing restricting regulation has to balance reducing risks with reducing potential benefits.

‘In this case the risks are unlikely, some already proven not to exist, while the benefits are potentially enormous. It really could be a revolutionary intervention in public health if smokers switched from cigarettes to electronic cigarettes.

‘So killing benefits, which are huge, for risks which are small is like asking (people) to stop using mobile phones and tablets, or restrict their use and further development, because of a one in ten million chance that the battery might overheat in your device.’
