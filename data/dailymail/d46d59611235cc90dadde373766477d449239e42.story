Our love affair with mobile phones, iPads and other gadgets is ruining our sex lives, research shows.

In-depth interviews with couples from across England revealed that modern technology is playing havoc with our relationships.

Some 40 per cent of those questioned said they had put off having sex to make a phone call, send a text message or surf the web.

Others said they had rushed romance in order to respond to messages.

And one third admitted to answering their phone during sex.

Couples are using their smartphones so much in bed they're 'living in different worlds', researchers found

One woman who spoke to the Durham University researchers described her husband’ s smartphone as the ‘third person in our marriage’.

Another said: ‘Sometimes I’ll be on Facebook and he’ll be on a sporting app while we are both in bed; we realise that we are sitting next to each other but living in different worlds.’

Researcher Dr Mark McCormack, who carried out detailed interviews with 15 couples, said that taking phones and laptops into the bedroom has ‘potentially serious costs to relationships’.

His study, commissioned by Durex, also revealed more than a quarter of couples had filmed themselves having sex and that 40 per cent had sent sexy pictures to each other.

Susie Lee, of the Siren dating app, warned that technology can never completely replace human interaction.

She said: ‘True chemistry comes from intimacy.

‘So whilst we need our tech – it has enhanced our lives, enabling us to reconnect with old friends, reach wider social groups and meet new people – we need to recognise the times and places when social networking doesn’t enhance our experience.

‘We really need to learn how to focus on each other in the bedroom, rather than on our smartphones or tablets.’
