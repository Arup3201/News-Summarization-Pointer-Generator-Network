Not many people would be brave enough to give a leopard a head massage - but this big cat loves it. 

Footage uploaded to YouTube shows the leopard lying on its back in a cage while a keeper strokes its head. 

The animal - called Voodoo - sounds like it is in kitty heaven as it purrs loudly.

Voodoo could pounce at any time but the zoo keeper is completely at ease as he gives the animal its morning massage.

It is believed the leopard was being kept at Cedar Cove Feline Conservation Park in Louisburg, Kansas which provides refuge for big cats which have been abandoned, neglected or whose owners are unable to care for them.

The video has been viewed nearly one million times on the video sharing website. 

Leopards are graceful and powerful big cats closely related to lions, tigers, and jaguars.

They live in sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China.

However, many of their populations are endangered, especially outside of Africa.

The leopard is so strong and comfortable in trees that it often hauls its kills into the branches.

By dragging the bodies of large animals aloft it hopes to keep them safe from scavengers such as hyenas.

Leopards
 can also hunt from trees, where their spotted coats allow them to blend
 with the leaves until they spring with a deadly pounce.

Leopards are normally found living in sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China

These nocturnal predators also stalk antelope, deer, and pigs by stealthy movements in the tall grass.

When human settlements are present, leopards often attack dogs and, occasionally, people.

Leopards are strong swimmers and very much at home in the water, where they sometimes eat fish or crabs.

Female leopards can give birth at any time of the year.

They usually have two grayish cubs with barely visible spots.

The mother hides her cubs and moves them from one safe location to the next until they are old enough to begin playing and learning to hunt.

Cubs live with their mothers for about two years—otherwise, leopards are solitary animals.

Most leopards are light colored with distinctive dark spots that are called rosettes, because they resemble the shape of a rose.

Black leopards, which appear to be almost solid in color because their spots are hard to distinguish, are commonly called black panthers.
