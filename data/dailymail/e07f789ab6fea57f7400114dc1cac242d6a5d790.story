A rare monkey who was snatched from her enclosure with her baby by gangsters in an organised raid has given birth to twins. 

Mamma, a Cotton-top Tamarin, was stolen from Blackpool Zoo alongside four other monkeys last April by a suspected group of black-market pet thieves. 

The 15-month-old was discovered days after being abducted, but her baby was never found.

Now more than a year later, the animal has given birth to healthy twins which are 'doing well'.

Mamma was stolen from her enclosure in the dead of the night last April by a group of suspected animal traffickers.

The rare monkey was found in a cardboard box three days later alongside three other animals, but her offspring was never found. 

The cotton-top tamarin is a small New World monkey weighing less than 0.5 kg.

One of the smallest primates, it is easily identified by the long white sagittal crest extending from its forehead to its shoulders.

Up to 40,000 cotton-top tamarins were caught and exported for use in biomedical research before 1976 when they were given the highest level of protection and all international trade was banned.

The wild population is estimated at 6,000 individuals, with 2,000 adults, with the species listed in among the World’s 25 Most Endangered Primates in 2012.

Experts say small monkeys like tamarins and macaques are becoming an increasingly popular pet in the US despite a ban by several states ban on owning a primate.

Keepers at Blackpool Zoo feared she may never recover from the sadness of losing her baby when they discovered she was in the early stages of pregnancy. 

'Keepers at Blackpool Zoo were devastated earlier this year when five of our monkeys were stolen, as every single animal we have here is considered a member of our zoo family,' said Charlotte Pennie, Senior Primate Keeper. 

'We worked very closely with Lancashire Police and following huge media interest four of the five were found days later.

'The two new babies, who are yet to be sexed and named, are doing extremely well and we are delighted for. 

'The pair are also vital for the international breeding programme, so it is great news all round.'

Lancashire Police feared Mamma and the other monkeys were targeted to be sold onto the black market as pets to wealthy buyers when they were snatched last year. 

When they returned to the zoo they had to sleep in a separate crate in case the other animals had forgotten what they looked like and decided to attack.

The Cotton-top Tamarin was found three days after being stolen in a cardboard box in west Yorkshire. Lancashire Police believed they were targeted to be sold onto the black market as pets for wealthy buyers

'That was a serious concern but with the speedy return we got them back in time and managed to reintegrate them well. 

'The female was very quiet when she first came back - that may have been the stress as well as the fact she was missing her baby.

'They had a few marks on them but otherwise they came back healthy. We were all so happy to get them back - to be honest to get any of them back was brilliant. 

'But the baby was so dependent on its mother, I think we have come to the conclusion we are not going to see that one again.'

Lancashire Police revealed no one had been arrested in connection with the investigation.
