Immigration minister Mark Harper sought to allay fears about the scale of the influx from Bulgaria and Romania in the New Year

Britain will not face a flood of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria when border controls lapse in the New Year, the immigration minister insisted last night.

Mark Harper played down fears of a mass influx from the Eastern European countries and ruled out extending the restrictions on migrant workers.

Ministers have come under pressure from Tory backbenchers to defy the EU and protect British jobs by keeping controls in place.

Currently, Romanians and Bulgarians can only work in the UK on seasonal fruit-picking visas or if they are self-employed. From January, they will have the same working rights as Britons.

Mr Harper said extending the restrictions from when they expire on New Year’s Eve was ‘not legally possible’ because it would be overturned in court. However, he insisted he was ‘not complacent’ about potential problems and pointed to measures to limit migrants’ access to social housing and benefits.

‘You won’t see people just being able to turn up and get access to social housing five minutes after they arrive, which is one of the things that drives people up the wall,’ he said at a press conference.

He rejected comparisons between next year’s changes and 2004, when Labour opened up the borders to eight Eastern European countries, including Poland.

Officials predicted that just 13,000 migrants would come to Britain every year, but more than a million have arrived.

Controls: Border Agency officials evict Romanian migrants. In 2007, when the country joined the EU, 'transitional controls' were applied which meant migrants must have a job offer in order to cross the border

Mr Harper said there was a ‘big 
difference’ between now and 2004 because eight other EU countries will 
also be forced to drop restrictions on January 1. He said migrants would
be lured to Germany by jobs and to other countries with larger Romanian
and Bulgarian populations.

‘In 2004, we were the only major 
country not to have transitional controls,’ he said. ‘All the other big 
countries did, so anyone that wanted to come to work somewhere legally 
came to the United Kingdom which is why we had such a significant number
of people.’

Last week, former Home Secretary Jack Straw said dropping border controls in 2004 was a ‘spectacular mistake’.

Concerns over the likely scale of 
immigration from the two countries, which have a combined population of 
29million, prompted Tory backbenchers this week to demand controls be 
extended. Nigel Mills, the MP for Amber Valley, proposed extending them 
until the end of 2018.

But Mr Harper said this would be a breach of EU treaties signed by the last Labour government.

He said: ‘It simply isn’t legally 
possible. The accession treaties only give us the ability – and the 
other eight counties with transitional controls – to extend them to the 
end of the year. We’ve extended the controls to their legal maximum.’

Mr Harper refused to make an official 
prediction of how many Romanians and Bulgarians would arrive from 
January, claiming to do so would be a ‘fool’s errand’.

Migration campaigners have predicted 
50,000 a year will arrive, blowing a hole in the Government’s pledge to 
cut net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ by 2015.
