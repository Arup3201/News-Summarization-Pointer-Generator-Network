The picture of an urbanely handsome, silver-haired man caught the eye of lonely women across both Europe and America.

An Oxbridge education, glittering CV and worldly sophistication added to his allure.

And when he revealed he was a widower raising his small son alone, he could not have sounded like a more perfect love-match.

However, the photographs and career highlights belonged to British politician Lord Brian Paddick, who is gay and happily married to Norwegian Petter Belsvik.

Trick: A fake Facebook profile set up using pictures of Brian Paddick as part of a 'silver fox' dating con aimed at scamming money from single women

His identity had been lifted from the internet by a gang of international fraudsters stalking single women on both sides of the Atlantic.

The conmen used his details to create rogue profiles on reputable dating websites, cross-referenced with matching fake accounts on Facebook and Skype.

Once online romance had blossomed, the tricksters asked for money to be wired to a Western Union account in Ghana on the pretext of either a business opportunity or a personal crisis.

The complex ‘Silver Fox’ fraud was unveiled when two women who had fallen for Lord Paddick’s  pictures tracked him down in real life to warn him.

Fury: Lord Paddick, who was alerted to the scam by women who had been duped, is gay and happily married to Norwegian Petter Belsvik

It is the latest twist in a global phenomenon where handsome older men – so-called Silver Foxes – are used as bait for lonely middle-aged women, who often have access to cash after being widowed or divorced.

As well as Lord Paddick, American General Wesley Clark’s photograph and military background routinely appear on fake internet dating profiles.

He is one of the most highly decorated four-star generals of the US military.

War hero: Photographs of American Colonel Tim Collins were also used on fake profiles

British Gulf War hero Colonel Tim Collins has also been exploited. The former officer from the Royal Irish Regiment shot to global prominence after his eve-of-battle speech to troops in Iraq in 2003.

The married father of five once received an anguished email from an American woman waiting for him at Pittsburgh Airport – asking why ‘he’ had not disembarked from his flight after she had bought ‘him’ a ticket home from the Gulf.

Fake emails purportedly from him to other American lonely hearts claim he is divorcing his wife and making a fresh start in the US, where he has been given a new home by the President for his  ‘services to humanity’.

Last night Lord Paddick spoke out to condemn the cruel conmen, saying: ‘These women have been profoundly confused and distressed, extraordinarily strong emotional attachments have developed and money has changed hands.

‘It’s been devastating for them and I am powerless to stop it. Who knows how many more victims have chosen, through embarrassment or sheer heartbreak, to keep quiet.’

The 55-year-old Liberal Democrat peer was alerted to the hijacking of his pictures and data when a  German single mother emailed to say she had been swindled.

Within 48 hours, the former Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police had also been contacted by an American nurse.

The gang pretending to be Lord Paddick are Ghanaian and use aliases for him – Alvin Coleman in the US and Henry Smith in Germany.

One of the Henry Smith victims, a divorced mother of three from Lower Saxony, spoke to The Mail on Sunday on condition of anonymity.

'Betrayed': Nurse Debbie Cason fell victim to the 'Silver Fox' scam

Nurse Debbie Cason fell victim to the Silver Fox scam after signing up with American site Match.com last month. 

Debbie, 60, of Illinois, received a message from  a man calling himself  Alvin Coleman – who used Lord Paddick’s pictures and professional details from his time  as a Metropolitan Police chief.

Coleman invited the divorcee to become a friend on Facebook and within days she was spending up to three hours a night chatting to him on the social media site.

She said: ‘I couldn’t believe that this distinguished, educated, sophisticated man – let’s face it, he was a great catch – wanted to spend so much time with me.

'I was flattered but a bit baffled when he started asking me what kind of jewellery I liked and if I’d accompany him on some of his round-the-world trips.

‘It was my 15-year-old grandson who said, “This is too good to be true.” He did an image search on Google and showed me photos of Brian Paddick. ‘He said: “Grandma, this man is the Mayor of London.’’ [Lord Paddick was twice Lib Dem candidate for Mayor]. My first thought was, “Why has the Mayor of London stolen Alvin Coleman’s photos?’’ ‘That shows you how deep you can get in just a few days.‘I always thought internet dating was a safe choice and, in retrospect, I ignored a lot of red flags. I feel hurt, betrayed, used, embarrassed and angry at my own gullibility.’

She told how Smith had been portrayed as a widowed Australian engineer working in Berlin and raising an eight-year-old son alone.

Within days she was chatting to him for two hours at lunchtime and two hours in the evening.

‘I became emotionally dependent on him very fast,’ she recalls. ‘He reached out to me, let me dream of a future together and told me things I desperately wanted to be true.

'It was a slick psychological con trick.

‘He dropped into conversation a couple of times that his company did fundraising for a hospital in Ghana and he went there to help.

‘So when he called me from Africa on one occasion it checked out. I thought he was a humanitarian helping with blankets and clothes for sick children.

Vulnerable: The con is aimed at luring lonely women and tricking them into sending cash

'While there, he asked for money, €850 [£710], to pay for the shipping costs of some gold which he said would secure his future and mine.

'It was a line from a B-list movie and I fell for it. I thought if I didn’t send the money then I wouldn’t get to see him when he came back as promised.

‘I wired €300 [£250] which took me up to my overdraft limit. When he demanded more I guessed I’d been conned – I wanted to run to the bathroom to be physically sick.

‘My 16-year-old daughter used image-matching technology and identified Henry Smith as Brian Paddick. I haven’t told many people or gone to the police. I am too sad and ashamed.

'Worst of all is that for the month I was corresponding with Henry Smith, I was the happiest I have been in many years.’

Partly in response to the scale and seriousness of these online dating scams, 13 of Britain’s best-known internet dating websites have formed a new trade association – the Online Dating Association – to be launched next month.

One of its key concerns will be its members’ ability to safeguard the hearts and  wallets of vulnerable clients. Its chief executive will be George Kidd, a former British consul and ex-Cabinet Office director responsible for compliance policy.

He said: ‘Online dating is now part of everyday life, it’s the biggest single way people meet.

‘The industry has matured to the point that it needs a code of practice and membership of the ODA will  be like a hallmark people can trust.

'Our members each have their  own technological methods of  policing profiles and protecting clients and, of course, they have regard for the vulnerability of  people’s circumstances.

‘They do all they can, but they are not there to replace common sense. The guiding principle in online dating has to be: If you wouldn’t tell or give someone something in real life, don’t do it on the internet.’
