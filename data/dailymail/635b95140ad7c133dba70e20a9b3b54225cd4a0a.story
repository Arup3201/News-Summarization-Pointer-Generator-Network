Gatwick Airport have unveiled plans which they say will 'elimate' airport queues and speed up boarding times.

The Sussex airport will be the 'world's most efficient two-runway airport' if new designs created by British architect Sir Terry Farrell are implemented, bosses claim. 

The plans are part of the airport's campaign for a second runway.

The Airport Commission is due to rule on the best way to maximise the south of England's air capacity and is currently considering the possibility of a second runway at Gatwick or a third at Heathrow.

Gatwick have also created a series of adverts to be published this week highlighting that plans are 'comparatively simple and low risk and can be delivered in just 10 years, by 2025'.

The new designs aim to eliminate queues with self-service bag drops and electronic security gates, and by helping passengers to reach the boarding gate 30 minutes after arrival.

Architect Sir Terry Farrell plans are designed to eliminate queues with long lines of self-service kiosks for printing boarding passes and baggage tags, self-service check in desks and automated security gates

In addition, 'exceptionally' short taxiing times of just seven minutes will reduce operating costs and engine emissions.

According to the plans it will mean that Gatwick will be able to match the world’s quickest aircraft turnaround times.

Passengers will also be able to connect with flights leaving different terminals in 45 minutes and in 30 minutes from the same terminal.

The Gatwick Connect service is already in operation and allows passengers to travel on a combination of independently operated flights and transfer through Gatwick without having to transport their bags through the airport or check-in twice.

A spokesman for the airport said: ‘An expanded Gatwick would be the world's most efficient two-runway airport - flexible and responsive to meet the changing needs of passengers and airlines.

‘The plans demonstrate how queues will be eliminated, passenger transit through the airport will be sped up.’

Plans to expand Heathrow airport have also gone on display.

Among the options being considered are building an entirely new, third runway.

However, separate plans have also been submitted by Heathrow Hub, an independent proposal campaigning to double the size of Heathrow’s existing northern runway to more than four miles, and allowing planes to use either end at the same time.

Those behind the campaign say it would cut the noise of flights over London by shifting early morning flights to the new section of tarmac, meaning planes land and take off two and half miles further away from the capital.

Plans for new runways at Heathrow and Gatwick are currently being considered by the Airports Commission for expanding UK airport capacity.

The commission, led by businessman Sir Howard Davies, is due to issue its final report over the summer.

Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate said: ‘An expanded Gatwick can be delivered quickly and at no additional cost to the taxpayer so the UK can reap the economic benefits of expansion sooner.

‘The way we travel is changing fast and we have to change with it - only Gatwick can cater for all passengers, travelling to any destination, with any airline type, now and into the future.

According to Gatwick's new plans, 'exceptionally' short taxiing times of just seven minutes will reduce operating costs and engine emissions and ensure the airport will be able to match the world’s quickest aircraft turnaround times

‘Our plan recognises that traditional methods of transferring are in decline with many passengers exploiting new options to ‘self-connect’ between a mix of low cost short and medium haul, charter and long haul flights depending on their budget and needs.

Gatwick Connect is already in operation and allows passengers traveling on two independently operated flights to transfer through the airport without having to transport their bags.

‘Gatwick Connect - our ground-breaking service - is an example of us already responding to changing passenger behaviour and the needs of passengers will remain central to our plan to expand.’

Sir Terry Farrell added: ‘Queues have literally been designed out and the new terminal will be simple and convenient to use with few changes of level.

‘The airfield itself would also offer the shortest taxiing distances possible with the new apron sitting between, and in close-proximity to, both the existing and new runways.’
