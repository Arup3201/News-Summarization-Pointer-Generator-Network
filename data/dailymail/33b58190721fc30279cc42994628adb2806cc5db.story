South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright has resigned after weeks of pressure

Rotherham's crime tsar finally caved in to three weeks of public outrage and quit yesterday over the sexual abuse of 1,400 children in the town.

Shaun Wright, who had defied demands from political leaders of all parties to resign as South Yorkshire’s police and crime commissioner and refused to see why he should take any blame, claimed he was leaving ‘for the sake of the victims’.

An acting commissioner will be appointed until a by-election is held, but former home secretary David Blunkett, who was among the MPs to welcome Mr Wright’s departure, rejected calls to stand as the region’s next PCC.

It later emerged Mr Wright will not get a severance pay-off, but will keep his local authority pension, which he can claim from the age of 55. 

Mr Wright has faced demands to quit since a report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed that the authorities had repeatedly ignored warnings about the abuse of children by predominantly Asian men in Rotherham over 16 years.

For five years until 2010, Mr Wright was at the heart of official failure to tackle the problem as the Labour councillor in charge of children’s services. He later successfully stood for election as the party’s PCC candidate.

He refused to quit after the report’s publication last month, despite calls by the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary, the Deputy Prime Minister and Labour Party chiefs.

He resigned from the party, pre-empting Labour attempts to sack him, but remained determined to hold on to his £85,000-a-year PCC job even after a humiliating appearance before a committee of MPs and emotional scenes at a public meeting in Rotherham, where women who had been abused as children denounced him.

But yesterday he issued a statement saying the row was ‘detracting from the important issue, which should be everybody’s focus – the 1,400 victims in the report – and in providing support to victims and bringing to justice the criminals responsible for the atrocious crimes committed against them’.

‘With this in mind,’ he added, ‘I feel it is now right to step down . . . for the sake of those victims, for the sake of the public of South Yorkshire and to ensure the important issues outlined in the report about tackling child sexual exploitation can be discussed and considered in full and without distraction.’

His resignation came after a report found 1,400 had been abused over a 15-year period in Rotherham

A mother of one sexual abuse victim in the town said his late decision showed ‘how arrogant and indifferent he is’.

The woman, whose 17-year-old daughter claims she was groomed on social media and abused by men in the region, said: ‘I hope he’s the first in a long line.

‘We need to get the rest of them out and then we’ll know that children in Rotherham are safe.’

Sarah Champion, Labour MP for Rotherham, said she was delighted Mr Wright had quit, but frustrated he did not do so as soon as the report came out because ‘he has taken the attention away from the victims and he has become the story. It is like a double insult to the victims and because of that I still feel very angry towards him’.

John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said Mr Wright had ‘finally done the decent thing’ but for many it was ‘too little, too late’. He added Mr Wright had ‘failed the people of Rotherham and to try to remain in his post as police and crime commissioner was an insult to the victims and their families’.

Mr Blunkett said it was a great pity that Mr Wright did not step down immediately.

Theresa May, the Home Secretary, said she was pleased he had quit, adding: ‘It is right that where people failed in their duty they should take responsibility. The police and local council failed the victims of these awful crimes and failed the people of Rotherham.’

Mr Wright has been harangued in public meetings since the report revealed 'blatant' failures by authorities

Rotherham child abuse victim Sarah Wilson, whose sister Laura was murdered by a member of an Asian paedophile ring, confronted South Yorkshire police chief Shaun Wright earlier this month

'My role as South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner has clearly become prominent in terms of public opinion and media coverage following the publication of Professor Alexis Jay's report.

'This is detracting from the important issue, which should be everybody's focus - the 1,400 victims outlined in the report - and in providing support to victims and bringing to justice the criminals responsible for the atrocious crimes committed against them.

'With this in mind, I feel that it is now right, to step down from the position of Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire, for the sake of those victims, for the sake of the public of South Yorkshire and to ensure that the important issues outlined in the report about tackling child sexual exploitation can be discussed and considered in full and without distraction.

'As I've previously stated, I entered into public service to make a positive difference in South Yorkshire.

'Protecting vulnerable people and particularly victims of child sexual exploitation has been my number one priority as Commissioner and much progress has been made over the last two years.

'My intention had always been to continue my work with South Yorkshire Police and partners in making all the necessary changes and improvements required to safeguard and support the victims of these horrific crimes, and indeed to protect further potential victims through preventative actions.

'On resigning, I therefore truly wish the force, all the very best in continuing the journey of positive transformational change of those essential services which protect and support our most vulnerable people.'
