Opposition education spokesman senator Kim Carr says voters are angry because the government came to office on the back of a lie.

'A lie that they would not change the way we funded our education system, a lie that said they wouldn't cut education, they wouldn't cut health, they wouldn't cut the ABC, they wouldn't cut pensions,' Senator Carr said in Melbourne.

'All of those things have now happened.

'Is there any wonder the Australian people are so cranky with this government and reject their approach to lying their way into office?'
