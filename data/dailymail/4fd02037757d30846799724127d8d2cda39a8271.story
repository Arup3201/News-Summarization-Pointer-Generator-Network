Southampton are flying high in the Barclays Premier League, second only to the mighty Chelsea with 11 games played, but it hasn't always been that way. 

Here, Sportsmail's Alex Kirby charts his memories of a slightly different Saints team - one which resorted to selling cheap tickets to students in a bid to fill St Mary's Stadium in League One...

It is Saturday, December 11, 2010 and I’m in Southampton, spending the last scraps of my student loan on snakebites, settling in to watching a day of Premier League football on the TV in a not particularly nice, but warm pub.

In stroll a couple of friends, they each have scores of tickets for a Southampton match happening that afternoon, just down the road at St. Mary’s. They're tasked with flogging them to their fellow students at discounted rates.

It wasn’t exactly a glamour tie - a League One scrap between Southampton and Brentford - but such was the desperation to fill the stands, tickets were going on sale to students for as little as £3. Bargain!

So, me and a few friends wobbled our way to St Mary’s and sat ourselves down for what seemed like a first half that lasted for all of eternity. 

The atmosphere was non-existent. Murmurs of despondency and roars of frustration poured from the crowd which was at least 10,000 shy of capacity.

We watched on as Southampton played football only comparable in lack of quality to my Primark hoody, one of the few things that cost less than my ticket.

By half-time, Brentford were 2-0 up. Freezing cold, bored rigid and surrounded by disillusioned Saints fans, me and my mates looked at each other, sheepishly rose from our seats and bumbled back to the relative safety and comfort of the nearby pub. On the short walk, I remember thinking to myself, "there’s no way I’m paying £3 to watch that s***e again!".

It’s hard to believe that just four years on, the same club are riding high, second in the Barclays Premier League and battling away for a place in Europe.

They’re not only filling the stands at St. Mary’s but pleasing the crowd with emphatic victories and a brand of football that’s being recognised – and very much enjoyed – by the masses.
