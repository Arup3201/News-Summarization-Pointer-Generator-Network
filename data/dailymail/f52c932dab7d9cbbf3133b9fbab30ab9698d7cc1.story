It may be notorious for its wet weather and seas of mud but they were nowhere to be seen today as the rain and clouds cleared and the sun made a welcome appearance at Glastonbury Festival.

Unprecedented crowds gathered at the Pyramid stage for the Rolling Stones' set. It is the first time the legendary rockers have played at Worthy Farm and their appearance has been hotly-anticipated, with thousands of fans wearing Stones t-shirts and masks

Crowds who yesterday wore wellies and raincoats, took advantage of the afternoon's warm weather by stripping down to beachwear and lying on the grass at Worthy Farm, in Somerset, for a spot of sunbathing.

Celebrities have flocked to the 
festival, with Prince Harry rumoured to be accompanying on-off 
girlfriend Cressida Bonas who was seen near the Park Stage.

The
viewing area at the Pyramid Stage was extended to allow for the crowds 
expected to be in place for the start of their 9.30pm set, with festival
organiser Michael Eavis saying he was worried the band could prove to 
be too popular.

Public Enemy and Chase & Status 
are performing on other stages at the same time - but for many of the 
135,000 ticket holders, the Stones are the main draw of the weekend.

Fans are busy guessing who the band's 
special guests will be - with bets placed on Bruce Springsteen and Adele
- and the meaning of the giant mechanical phoenix on top of the stage.

Chris Kneller, 25, a Formula One 
design engineer from Maidstone, Kent, said: 'It's going to be one of 
those classic Glastonbury moments. There's a bit of anticipation because
of the massive bird on the Pyramid - there's never been anything on it 
before.

'It got pretty bad with Arctic Monkeys there last night, so I can't imagine how crowded it will get though.'

Adam Robinson, a 25-year-old personal 
trainer from Ipswich, said: 'It's probably the only time we'll ever see 
the Stones. I know the festival organisers have been trying to get hold 
of them for a long time, so there will be a brilliant atmosphere.

'I predict there will be a massive singalong.'

Victoria Hamilton, 25, from Swansea, 
wearing a t-shirt showing the Stones in their 60s heyday, said: 'I don't
know how they do it at their age. I'd love it if Adele came on with 
them.'

David Knight, 56, from Glastonbury, is looking forward to seeing Sir Mick Jagger perform for the fourth time.

'It's going to be pretty amazing to 
have them here,' he said. 'It's the biggest festival in the world and 
the world's greatest rock and roll band. I think they go together very 
well.'

Sir Mick's brother also lives in Glastonbury and could well be among the audience, along with Jade and Elizabeth Jagger.

Celebrities including Wayne and 
Colleen Rooney and Kate Moss are expected to be watching the 2hr 15min 
set, the first hour of which will be televised on the BBC.

Guitarist Keith Richards said this 
week that the band was 'destined' to make an appearance at Glastonbury, 
despite turning down a slot for many years, and declared: 'It had to be 
done.'

In an interview about the performance 
posted online, guitarist Richards said: 'I mean there were many years 
when we were offered it and turned it down. I look upon it as a 
culmination of our British heritage really. It had to be done and it's 
gonna be done, and we'll see what happens, you know.'

Temperatures are set to reach 20C on site today, according to Meteogroup forecaster James Wilby.

He said: 'When the Stones come on at 
9.30pm it will be mild, about 15C. There'll be sunny spells during the 
day but there are fair amounts of cloud around.'

Police said they are pleased crime levels have fallen from the last festival, in 2011.

There have been 160 crimes committed, 
compared with 228 at the same point in 2011, a reduction of 29.8 per 
cent. So far there have been 89 thefts from tents, which is down by 
around 10 per cent, and 42 drugs offences, down a third on the previous 
festival.

The Glastonbury festival started on Wednesday and runs until Sunday June 30
