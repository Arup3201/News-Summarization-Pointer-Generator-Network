This badger had the RSPCA and firefighters running around in circles after giving both emergency services the slip. 

The creature was discovered at the foot of cliffs in Saltdean, near Brighton, East Sussex, at 8am this morning by a member of the public who thought it had an injured leg. 

But when animal welfare officer Steve Wickham arrived, the badger scarpered - only to run and hide in the wheel suspension of his RSPCA van.

Cheeky: The badger did a runner and hid underneath the RSPCA van where it got stuck

Rescue: Steve Wickham tries to capture the badger which hid under the van

Mr Wickham had to call on the help of East Sussex Fire Brigade which then lifted the van up to free the animal.

But the mischievous creature did not want to be caught and raced to a van parked in front where he hid again.

Luckily, Mr Wickham managed to coax him out before he got stuck again. 

Mr Wickham said: 'Badgers are nocturnal creatures so they like to be in dark places.

Putting up a fight: The badger was quite happy hiding underneath cliffs near Brighton

In you go: Animal welfare officer Steve Wickham got more than he bargained when he turned up to rescue this pesky badger

'I think he was looking for a place to hide and he went up inside my van.

'I tried to get him out but couldn't catch him properly.

'So we asked the fire bridge to lift the van up instead of using a jack which isn't as secure.

'He then shot out under another van but we managed to coax him out.'

Local photographer Eddie Mitchell was on hand to capture the reluctant rescue.

He said: 'The RSPCA thought it was going to be a simple rescue but this was quite a shrewd badger.

'He legged it. He did put up a little bit of a fight. He was a cheeky little so and so.'

The badger was not hurt and will be released back into the wild by the RSPCA this evening.
