Death crash: Illegal immigrant Iqbal Singh, 39, was driving without a licence when he killed father-of-four Malcolm Anderson in a motorway accident

An illegal immigrant who escaped before he could be deported went on to cause the death of a father after falling asleep at the wheel.

Indian-born Iqbal Singh, 39, absconded after being refused permanent leave to remain in the UK following his arrival in 2000.

He was driving a van without a licence or insurance when he crashed into father-of-four Malcolm Anderson’s car on the M6 last December.

Yesterday the electrician’s widow told of her anger after the illegal driver was jailed for just two years over the crash which also left her and son Jason, 13, badly hurt.

Deborah Anderson, 50, said: ‘Singh will walk free in a few months while we have been given a life sentence.

‘Armed robbers sometimes get life because they use weapons. The van driven by Singh was the weapon used to kill my husband.’

Singh admitted causing Mr Anderson’s death by careless driving and faced a maximum five-year jail term when he appeared at Warwick Crown Court for sentencing earlier this week.

But Judge Michael Cullum reduced the sentence to credit Singh for his early guilty plea over the crash, which happened when the Andersons were returning home to Stechford, Birmingham, in convoy after a family wedding.

Warwick Crown Court heard Singh swerved to avoid a car carrying their three daughters, Sarah, 23, Emma, 20 and Michelle, 18, but hit Mr Anderson’s Ford Escort.

The car careered into a concrete post and overturned. Mr Anderson died of a heart attack at the scene.

Mrs Anderson, who was cut free from the wreckage, had a punctured lung and cracked ribs. Jason suffered a broken nose, a damaged ankle and bruises on his lung. Singh, from Birmingham but of no fixed address, was uninjured in the incident on the northbound carriageway of the M6 near Coventry.

He said he had either shut his eyes for a second or taken his eyes off the road.

Talbir Singh, defending, said Singh had expressed his remorse in letters to the judge and Mr Anderson’s family.

Singh was originally charged with causing death by dangerous driving, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years, but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge on Monday.

He also admitted causing death while unlicensed and uninsured.

Gail Adams, UK Border Agency regional director, said: ‘Iqbal Singh did not enter the UK illegally. He was given limited leave to remain when he entered in 2000 and then applied for permanent leave to remain which was rejected. But before he could be removed he absconded.’

Singh will be deported to India at the end of his jail term.
