A grand jury has decided not to charge anyone in an alleged sexual assault near Ohio University that was photographed and filmed by witnesses, a prosecutor said Monday.

Athens County Prosecutor Keller Blackburn said the grand jury determined there wasn't probable cause to file charges after a man and woman were photographed in a sex act against the front window of a bank near the southern Ohio campus in the early hours of October 12.

Explicit photos of the two were circulated via social media, and the woman later told police she was a victim of a sexual assault.

Tweeted: The photo Blanc posted, which MailOnline has cropped, shows the man kneeling down and performing a sex act on the woman against a wall

Investigators determined the couple, 
both 20-year-old students, had alcohol from a bar before the sex act, 
Blackburn said in a statement Monday.

Blackburn said the man asked the woman whether to stop the act when a crowd formed, and she said no.

The
 man has cooperated with police. The woman didn't remember what 
happened, and testing showed no sign of any 'date rape drug,' Blackburn 
said.

He said the couple wasn't aware at the time that their act was being filmed.

'Every
 decision we make now has the potential to be placed on Twitter, 
Facebook, commented on, shared and embellished, making life today more 
public than ever before,' Blackburn said in the statement.

'If a lesson exists from this case, let it be that we should behave as if our family is always watching.'

Spreading the word: Twitter and Instagram users posted about the alleged incident not knowing that the woman has since reported it to police as a sexual assault

University
 President Roderick McDavis had said the school would conduct its own 
investigation and, if appropriate, would take action to hold people 
accountable.

He said 
that some of the response within the university community had been 
divisive and that he hoped instead it would inspire greater caring at 
the campus about 70 miles southeast of Columbus.

The
 video and picture quickly became a national news story, provoking 
outrage at those who did not intervene and some bloggers it seems 
started hunting for the woman - claiming that she had only filed a 
sexual assault suit because she was embarrassed at the footage.

However,
 not only did the shameful web users go after the potential victim of a 
sexual assault - they also identified the wrong girl.

Journalism
 student, Rachel Cassidy, was wrongly named on Twitter as the woman in 
the now notorious images and video of a girl being pinned against a wall
 while a man performed oral sex as passers-by only stopped to film it.

Incorrectly identified: Rachel Cassidy was 
falsely named as the alleged victim of a sexual assault on October 12th 
at Ohio University Homecoming that was filmed and uploaded to the 
Internet

Vile: This is the Tweet that named Rachel Cassidy as the girl involved in the rape claim after she was filmed on the street at the Ohio University Homecoming

Rachel
 was named by @Anon_Central — a popular Twitter account with over 
170,000 followers as the alleged victim days after the incident and was 
accused of being a 'liar' only interested in saving her own 'ass'.

However,
 Rachel has come forward to explain that she is '100 percent' not the 
woman involved and that she was nowhere near the incident at Chase Bank,
 2 S. Court St., on Saturday, October 12th.

Police officers have also confirmed that she was not involved.

One of the individuals who stood and videoed the incident was named and shamed by the MailOnline earlier this month.

Vance Blanc, 19, tweeted the image the morning after with the caption: 'So I witnessed this the other night. This is the photo.'

Blanc sent it to @Huntermoore, who is the man behind the notorious now shuttered 'Revenge Porn' website Anyone Up?

Shame: Vance Blanc, a 19-year-old college 
student, is one of those being criticized for failing to step in and act
 while the alleged sexual assault was occuring. Instead he's among a 
handful of people who posted pictures online

He
 also tweeted it at @68StewartSt, a user who goes by the name of The 
Animal House who seems to be an OU student who puts on parties.

When the story went viral Blanc was initially belligerent and tweeted: 'You don't wanna get embarrassed? don't do stupid shit.'

He later took down the image and apologized, claiming to be 'ashamed.'

The explicit photos of the alleged assault were taken and shared on social media after the college homecoming celebration.

The
 woman seen receiving oral sex in the photos and videos reportedly had 
no idea what happened to her until the next morning when she saw the 
photos online.

Many of the photos of incident have been taken down by the Instagram users who originally posted them, but news sites like Buzzfeed republished them.

The
 woman in the photos contacted the police the day after the incident and
 reported that she had been a victim of sexual assault to the Athens 
police department.

Close for comfort: The photos suggest the alleged sexual assault took place against the Chase bank on Court Street which is about a block away from the police department

In one 
of the most graphic photos- which shows the man kneeling in front of the
 woman as she leans against a Chase bank- makes it clear that there were
 onlookers just feet away from the incident as it was in progress.

Blanc wasn't the only one to witness the incident.

'Still
 can believe a dude was ****** *** on court street Saturday night in 
front of like 10 people,' a different Twitter user wrote.

Not only was the scene of the alleged crime a busy street but it was also one block away from the police station.

While police were still investigating the case, the community was already going on the attack.

'Some
 of us are really angered and disappointed that no one intervened and 
they just filmed it,' Allie Erwin, a student at Ohio University who 
leads an anti-rape group on campus, said at the time.

'Their
 first impulse was to share it on social media and make a mockery of 
something that was probably the worst thing that’s ever happened to her.
 There are other people who saw it as her asking for it and think it’s a
 joke. Basically they're slut-shaming her for what happened,' she said 
according to Metro.

'The response on social media is kind of heartbreaking, how harsh and cruel people are being.'
