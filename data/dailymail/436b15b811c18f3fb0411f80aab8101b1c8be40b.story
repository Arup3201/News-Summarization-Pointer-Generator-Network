The Pitt: As one half of design team Pitt-Pollarmo, actor Brad Pitt has come up with a 20s-inspired modernist range of furniture

Wiggly bookshelves, a bed made of stingray skin leather, a marble bathtub shaped like a bottom and a plastic armchair....who lives in a house like this?

Well, you could, if you have a few thousand pounds handy and fancy using it to kit out your home with a furniture line designed by Hollywood A-lister Brad Pitt.

Angelina Jolie's beau has somehow found the time - in between filming and helping to raise the couple's six children - to collaborate with designer Frank Pollaro on a limited edition collection of 1920's-inspired modern pieces.

The Pitt-Pollaro 
collection has been in development for four years, and made its 
world premiere in New York City this week.

The company describe their pieces - each of which are signedand numbered, and come with a certificate of authenticity - as 'designed by Pitt, built by Pollaro'.

The relationship between Pitt and Polllaro began in 2008 when the actor commissioned a custom desk from Pollaro Custom Furniture.

The Pitt-Pollaro website explains: 'Frank Pollaro personally delivered the desk to Brad's chateau in the south of France.

'During the installation, Brad and Frank found that they had a common passion for furniture and fine details. They discussed design history and their appreciation of materials, old and new. Most importantly, they shared a commitment to perfection.

'During their discussion, Frank noticed a design sketch book on a nearby table. Intrigued by the hundreds of sketches that Brad had created over a ten-year period, Frank encouraged Brad to allow Pollaro to transform his drawings into three-dimensions.'

The pair began to work together on furniture designs, and over a four year period created the limited edition collection at Pitt's house in France.

The pieces they have created include a marble bathtub, built for two and shaped like a bottom; a number of glass tables with complex stainless steel legs; a sloping bed built from wood and leather from stingray skin; armchairs made from white plastic and fake fur; higgeldy-piggeldy cabinets

Each piece is numbered and signed by both Pitt and Pollaro, and more items will be added to the collection as they are created. The partners are also open to creating custom commissions.

To view the whole collection or enquire about purchasing a piece, visit the Pitt-Pollaro website.
