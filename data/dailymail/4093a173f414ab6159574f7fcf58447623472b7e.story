This is the 85-year-old New York wannabe playboy who was allegedly robbed by 17-year-old twin sisters he met on a sugar daddy dating site called Seeking Arrangement.

Paul Aronson was tied to a coffee table for 20 hours after he took  Shalaine and Shaina Foster to dinner where he is accused of providing them with alcoholic beverages.

The trio then headed back to his 38th Street apartment where he served them more alcohol - before the girls bound him with zip ties, a court heard.

They then stole his credit cards and $470 in cash before going shopping for make-up, it has been claimed.

Aronson was later found tied up on the floor by a friend. That's when Aronson called the cops. 

The Foster sisters were charged on Monday with kidnapping, robbery, burglary, larceny, and assault. 

The girl's, who both have criminal records, were held without bail in a Manhattan Criminal Court.

The New York Daily News reports that when Aronson excitedly took the girls back to his brownstone on 38th street, he served them a few more drinks before the girls turned the table on him and robbed him after tying him up with zip ties.  

The New York Daily news spoke to the girls' brother outside the courtroom on Monday.

'The story sounds f****ed up,' he said.

'But it’s also an 85-year-old wealthy man who basically has these young girls like they’re in a candy store,' he said.

'We know he bought them liquor and intoxicated them and took him back to the house.'

Reporters also spoke the twins' mother who is denying all accusations against her daughters.

'These are 17-year-old girls ... college-bound, upstanding citizens,' said their overwhelmed mother.

'They’re not sleazy girls at all, whatsoever. It’s going to ruin their lives forever.'

'I don’t know what to say other than this is horrible,' she said.

Shaina has one felony arrest for possession of a sealed instrument (alcoholic beverage) plus one sealed arrest.

Shalaine was arrested last April for introduction of prison contraband in addition to two sealed arrests.

While the age of consent in 17 in New York, the website Seekingarrangement.com states that all members must be over the age of 18.

Aronson signed up for the website on October 1 where he encountered Shaina.

When Aronson invited her to dinner, to his delight, she showed up with Shalaine.

The site defines a sugar daddy as, 'Successful men and women who know what they want. They’re driven, and enjoy attractive company by their side. Money isn’t an issue, thus they are generous when it comes to supporting a Sugar Baby.'

Took them home: When Paul Aronson took the teens back to his brownstone (not pictured) on 38th street in Manhattan, they allegedly tied him up with zip ties and took his credit cards along with $470 

A sugar baby is described as, ‘Attractive people looking for the finer things in life. They appreciate exotic trips and gifts. Sugar Babies get to experience a luxurious lifestyle, and meet wealthy people on a regular basis.’

The Mail Online contacted Seeking Arrangement to inquire about how they regulate the safety of their members and ensure they are of legal age. 

In an emailed statement Seeking Arrangement speedily replied, 'We require individuals to be 18 years or older in order to use our site. We rely on self-reporting which is the same age verification process all other dating websites and social media platforms use. 

'Unfortunately, there are some people who lie about their age. If we have any reason to suspect that a member is underage, we take immediate action and ask for proof of identity before that member will be allowed to continue using our site. If they cannot provide proof then they are suspended and removed from the site.' 

 In regard to background checks and ensuring the safety of their members they said: 'SeekingArrangement.com goes to great lengths to protect the integrity of our site, and our members. Not only do we vet every member before a profile is approved, we also are one of the only online dating sites that offer background verification. While this is not a requirement, we encourage all members to only date those who have been background verified.'

That being said, members on any dating site or online should proceed with caution before meeting in person.
