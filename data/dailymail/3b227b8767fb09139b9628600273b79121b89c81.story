Vice President Joe Biden is famous for his off-beat humor, but when he swore in the new Congress on Tuesday his jokes took on a remarkably creepier tone.

When introduced to Utah Senator Orrin Hatch's teenage granddaughter Emily, Biden commented: 'I hope you have a big fence around the house!'

The comment was made as Biden posed with the 80-year-old Republican senator's large family, on the day he officially became president pro tempore of Congress. 

Biden thought the joke about the girl's good looks so funny, he whipped it out again when he met the daughter of freshman Senator Joni Ernst. 

Pictures from the event show Biden with his arm around the Republican's daughter Libby, as Senator Ernst placeh her hand on a Bible to be sworn in. 

He  probably won't be calling Senator Ernst up for favors anytime soon. In addition to the strange comment towards her daughter, Biden also got the senator's name wrong at first - calling Joni by her husband's name, Gail.

Stale jokes: Biden later used the same line when he freshman Senator Joni Ernst's (in red) teenage daughter Libby (left) 

Getting close: Biden was pictured with his arm around Libby as her mother was sworn in. The VP probably didn't make a great impression on Ernst, since he called her by her husband's name - Gail (in red tie) - when they met on Tuesday

Biden's blush-worthy moments didn't end there. Excruciatingly awkward C-SPAN footage shows the moment he leaned in to kiss the red-headed daughter of Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware...and got rejected. 

Throughout the rest of the day, Biden continued to throw out flattery left and right. 

'As they say in southern Delaware, "Boy, you married up,"' he told the husband of Maine republican Susan Collins.

Biden likely felt free to let out these more casual comments since he spent more than three decades in the Senate.   

Pained: After posing with the family of Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware (left), Biden leaned down to whisper something to Coons' daughter Maragaret. She did not seem to enthused by what he had to say

Turned away: Perhaps the most excruciatingly awkward part of the ceremony was when Biden tried to kiss Coons' daughter Margaret on the head and she turned away
