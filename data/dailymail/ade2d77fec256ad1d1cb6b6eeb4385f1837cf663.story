Halloween costumes have been brought to life with app-enhanced technology that provides gruesome interactive illusions.

The costumes are the brainchild of former Nasa engineer, Mark Rober, who, after seven years of working on the Curiosity Rover, decided to turn his engineering skills to fancy dress.

Two years ago he created an incredible Halloween costume that gave the illusion that you could see through his body.  Scroll down for video...

The concept was simple. Mr Rober attached two iPads to the front and back of his body and then linked them up using Facetime.

His design became an instance YouTube hit gaining 1.5 million views in a day.

Over the next year, Mr Rober created a free app with different animations along with some T-shirt designs that he sold on the Digital Dudz website.

The designs involve cutting a hole in fancy dress costume, placing a phone in a specially engineered Velcro pouch, and then using the Digital Dudz smartphone app to display interactive animations.

There are 31 million smartphones in the UK and Google searches for wearable technology have increased six fold in the last 6 months

Last week, the company behind the spandex Morphsuit announced that it had acquired Digital Dudz.

Edinburgh-based AFG Media said it hopes the acquisition will help it become the ‘biggest player’ in the $6bn global fancy dress industry.

‘Technology has never moved faster or been more accessible to consumers,’ said Gregor Lawson, one of the co-founders of AFG Media.

‘There are 31 million smartphones in the UK and Google searches for wearable technology have increased six fold in the last 6 months.

He added that as well as app-powered costumes of zombie surgeons and pirates, the group will launch a range of Digital Dudz animated clothing.

Mr Rober has made headlines before with his quirky ideas.

Last year, he designed an experiment in which he placed rubber animals on the side of the road to see how many cars go out of their way to run over them.

Mr Rober found that about six per cent of the 1,000 drivers he observed would swerve out of their lane just so they could squish an animal, albeit a rubber one, with their vehicle.

In an entertaining YouTube video presenting his findings in the form of charts drawn with colourful crayons, Rober points out that 94 per cent of the motorists stayed their course and ignored the animal in the road.
