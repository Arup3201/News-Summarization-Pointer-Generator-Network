Britain's oldest man has died aged 110 years and 63 days, his friends revealed today.

The Reverend Reg Dean passed away on Saturday, just two months after celebrating his 110th birthday, according to an announcement by the Dalesmen Male Voice Choir in Derbyshire.

He was the choir’s life president, and helped to found the group in the 1980s.

The former United Reform Church minister saw 26 prime ministers enter Downing Street, 
received seven telegrams from the Queen, survived two world wars and lived to become Britain's oldest man.

Celebrations: Reg Dean celebrated his 110th birthday in November last year

Mr Dean, a former Army chaplain and 
teacher, was born in Tunstall, Staffordshire, on November 4 1902, just 
two years after the death of Queen Victoria.

He became Britain’s oldest 
man in June 2010 after the death of Stanley Lucas, 110, of Cornwall.

During the Second World War, Mr Dean 
was stationed in Burma in the Far East.

It was during his time in the 
Army that he said he found the key to his long life.

Three-times married Mr Dean named the source of his longevity as a ‘mysterious brown-looking’ elixir of life given to him by a 
doctor when he was an army chaplain in India.

'He said to me, “I have concocted a drink that will make you live for 
ever”, or something like that, and would I like to take it?’ he recalled on his 110th birthday in November.

‘Well I’m very naive, I can’t say no, so I drank it and here I am.’

Incredible: Mr Dean outlived the average human male by 32 years and the typical woman by 28 years

When speaking to ITV Central in 2011, Mr Dean said there are three questions everyone should ask themselves. 

These were 'who am I, why am I here and where am I going?'

He admitted that he didn't know the answers to any of them. 

The Reverend lived through five monarchs. The Wright brothers achieved the first manned flight just after his 1st birthday, and the Titanic sank when he was ten years old.

Reflecting on all he had witnessed 
during his life, he said at the time: ‘I remember before the days of 
Tarmac, the roads were all dust heaps.

‘I can remember hearing about the sinking of the Titanic when I was at my uncle’s farm.’

The father of one and grandfather of 
three returned to England in 1945 and settled in Stratford-on-Avon, before
 moving to Derby in 1947. In 1958, Mr Dean became a teacher at Herbert 
Strutt School in Belper, where he remained for 10 years.

He was also a minister at the United Reformed Churches in Wirksworth and Matlock before retiring 30 years ago aged 80.

In the late 1980s Mr Dean helped found the Dalesmen Male Voice Choir and was made life president.

The choir marked his 110th birthday 
with a performance from more than 200 singers from five male voice 
choirs at Derby’s Assembly Rooms.

He lived independently until four years ago when he movde to a sheltered
 housing complex, and received telegrams from the Queen to mark his 
100th and 105th birthdays and one every year since.

The world's oldest living man is Jiroemon Kimura, from Kyotango in Kyoto, Japan, according to a spokeswoman for the Guinness Book of Records.

He was was born on April 19, 1897, and is aged 115 years and 263 days.
