Tom Cruise has become the first Hollywood star to set up a page on the popular Russian social network Vkontakte.

Brave new world: Tom Cruise has become the first Hollywood star to set up a page on the popular Russian social network Vkontakte

The creation of the account was announced on Cruise's official Twitter account on Thursday.

'VK.com is a European social network w/100mil users & we JUST launched a profile," the message read, followed by "Увидимся там!" - "We'll see you there!' in Russian.

Although Vkontakte is predominantly a Russian-language network, Cruise's promotional team  - 'TeamTC,' as they call themselves - posted in English with a smattering of Russian words.

Eager to please their potential new Russian followers: 'What do we need to know...Any tips for us? We're new!' his representatives wrote on Friday morning, a post that was 'liked' over 650 times.

They also posted 'Here's the question
we are most often asked..."Does Tom ever post?" Answer: Some times 
between family and filming and when he does you can tell by the post 
signature, "-Tom".

Vkontakte, which means 'In Contact,' 
dominates the Russian social media market with more than 40 million 
users.

Cruise had almost 16,000 'friends' on the site as of this afternoon, two days after the account was launched.

Cruise's page is a sign of Russia's increasing box office clout.

Box office income rose 8 percent last
year to $1.3 billion, the ninth-highest in the world, and is expected 
to grow 9 percent this year.

In the trailer for Tom Cruise's new sci-fi thriller, Oblivion, the action star announces that 'Everyone's been evacuated, nothing human remains' on the desolate planet.

'Sixty years ago, Earth was attacked,' the 50-year-old is heard saying. 'We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet.'

The 'they' he refers to is an alien race called the Scavs who fought humans in a decades long war, but there is no sign of the creatures in the clip.

And the Hollywood heavyweight stars as Commander Jack Harper, a drone repairman, who serves as part of a 'clean-up crew' extracting what vital resources remain.

Tron: Legacy director Joseph Kosinski helmed Oblivion based on the graphic novel he penned for Radical Comics.
