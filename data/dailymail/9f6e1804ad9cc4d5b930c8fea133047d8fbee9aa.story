Thousands of bladder cancer patients face an uncertain future because stocks of a drug that prevents the disease progressing are running perilously low.

The crisis means patients may be soon given a stark choice: surgical removal of the entire organ, or risk the cancer returning.

Up to 12,000 people are to be left without the crucial medication, called BCG, as British hospitals run out of supplies.

One sufferer, Peter Massera, 48, who was diagnosed with bladder cancer six months ago, said his treatment with BCG had been ‘postponed indefinitely’ because of the shortage.

The marketing manager from Leek, Staffordshire, said: ‘When you’re put on a cancer treatment plan you don’t want to change anything in case your cancer returns.

‘So when you’re told you can’t have the treatment you were promised, it’s very worrying. My hospital told me they can’t get any BCG supplies, regardless of the quantity.

‘I’ve been told that I’ll be monitored closely and any tumours that develop will be “whipped out” but obviously that’s not ideal – you don’t want tumours returning at all.

‘I know people are being diagnosed with the same level of cancer I had and have been offered bladder removal as an alternative because of the shortage.’

BCG is a modified, safe form of the bacteria Bacillus Calmette-Guerin that stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies to tuberculosis. The drug is usually thought of as a vaccine given to children to protect against TB, yet it is also a key treatment for one of the most aggressive forms of bladder cancer.

A different strain is given to cancer patients, and in these cases the antibodies have been found to target tumour cells. Bladder cancer is the second most frequently occurring disease of the urinary system after prostate. It is also the fourth most common cancer in men and the tenth in women in the UK, with more than 10,000 cases a year, and 5,000 deaths.

The most high-profile patient in recent years is Dame Mary Archer, 70, the wife of author and politician Jeffrey. She was diagnosed with the disease in 2010 and underwent BCG treatment to try to halt the cancer’s progression before having her bladder removed.

Patti Hansen, 58, the model and actress wife of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, also suffered bladder cancer in 2007. She has since made a full recovery.

The shortage of the drug is the second such occurrence in two years. A flood at a factory owned by pharmaceutical company Sanofi, which manufactures BCG, led to supply problems in 2012. This left production limited to rival company MSD, but it is now struggling to cope with increased global demand.

Some doctors have advised patients to have their bladder removed completely because it is not known when stocks of the drug will be replenished.

Bladder cancer has one of the highest recurrence rates of any type of cancer, and BCG is the only drug used to protect against it. BCG is piped into the bladder via a catheter. It is given to patients with an aggressive form of bladder cancer which has not yet penetrated the bladder wall, following surgery to remove tumours.

The British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) is now calling on officials at NHS England and the drugs regulator to fast-track the licensing of other BCG strains from abroad in order to boost the UK’s supply and protect patients.

Unlicensed BCG strains can be imported and used with the patients’ consent, but it is up to individual hospitals to decide whether this is a route they want to take. 

Urologist Mark Speakman, president of BAUS, said: ‘There is an Indian product out there and that is where the Government could make a difference.

‘We have appropriately strict licensing regulations in this country but the Government could make it easier by expediting the approval of some of these other strains. At the moment, one or two hospitals are ordering these strains anyway, but at their own risk.

‘Patients are rightly worried about what’s going on and although there are no scare stories yet about things going badly wrong without BCG, the longer this shortage goes on the greater the risk there will be.’

Last month, Labour health spokeswoman Luciana Berger asked Whitehall officials what it was doing to address the shortage.

In reply, Life Sciences Minister George Freeman said the Government did not know how many patients were affected but officials were monitoring the situation and were ‘in close contact with BAUS’.

But Mr Speakman said this was not the case. ‘At what level they’re in contact with us is slightly passing me by at the moment,’ he said.

MSD issued a warning earlier this year that it expected there to be a shortage of BCG for a couple of months, but this has now been extended and is expected to last well into 2015.

Andrew Winterbottom, founder of the charity Fight Bladder Cancer, said: ‘Treatments for bladder cancer haven’t changed for over 35 years because so little research is done in this area. BCG is one of the few treatments available.

‘Two years ago when a shortage happened, the Government should have set up a system whereby we could import supplies, if only temporarily. Demand is growing every year and this problem is a combination of bad planning and bad luck.’

A spokesman for MSD said: ‘We are doing everything we can to meet this demand and have increased production by 100 per cent over the past two years.

‘But given that we are the only source of BCG in the UK and many other countries, and that BCG requires stringent and rigorous quality testing to ensure high-quality product for patients, fully meeting UK demand will take some time. Quantities may remain limited throughout 2014 and 2015 while we work hard to meet this demand.’

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said it would consider fast-tracking licensing applications in the event of a shortfall of medicines. 

A spokesman added: ‘We are providing advice on the requirements for obtaining a licence to manufacturers of BCG products who do not currently have licences for their products in the UK, and for importing medicines into the UK.’
