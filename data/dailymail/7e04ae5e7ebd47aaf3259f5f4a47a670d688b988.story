A Siberian husky dog that had all four of its legs cruelly ripped off is now able to walk again thanks to the dedication and kindness of a vet and the generosity of people touched by his story.

The dog, called Da Hei, was brought in to the surgery of vet Mr Liu in China's Dalian city in horrific condition in 2010.

The men left, saying they had to fetch some money from the bank, but never returned.

Brave: Da Hei endured horrific injuries but can now walk again thanks to a caring vet

Determined: It took eight months for the vet and the prosthetic limb company to refine the artificial legs

Mr Liu told CCTV News: ‘At the time Da Hei was in really bad shape. First I had to remove the dead skin and flesh from his limbs. Then I performed amputation on the bones. He's a survivor.’

Da Hei, who’s seven years old, took 19 days to recover from the traumatic operation, but Mr Liu was determined that he wouldn't just survive his injuries - but that he'd walk again.

With the help of donations from members of the public, he commissioned a prosthetic limb manufacturer to make artificial limbs for Da Hei.

Kind-hearted: Mr Liu has taken Da Hei in

Mr Liu said Da Hei was in terrible shape when he was brought in - but has now had his life transformed for the better

Grateful: Da Hei rests at Mr Liu's veterinary centre

It took eight months to refine them so that they fitted properly and Da Hei does find it painful to walk on them – but at least he’s now able to move around freely.

Mr Liu now sees Da Hei as his responsibility and has taken the dog in.
