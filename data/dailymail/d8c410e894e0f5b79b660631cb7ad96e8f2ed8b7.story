Abandoned: The usually busy car park in Leeds had shut its gates at the end of January, but morning commuters found the site was back in action after it was re-opened by conmen

Cheeky conmen disguised in high-vis jackets broke into a disused city car park and re-opened it - charging unknowing drivers £4 to leave their vehicles there.

The usually busy car park had shut its gates at the end of January, but morning commuters heading to work found to their surprise that the site was back in action.

Dozens of motorists paid a reported £4 
each for a day’s stay to two high-visibility jacketed ‘attendants’, who 
had put up signs bearing the name of the Elite Parking firm that ran the
 facility in Leeds, West Yorkshire until its closure.

However, it quickly emerged the people taking the payments had no connection to Elite and no right to be operating on the privately owned site.

By the time the security company responsible for the site arrived on the scene, the unauthorised pair had vanished.

Twenty Four 7 Security Services (UK) said that the site’s padlocked gates appeared to have been cut or forced open.

A staff member from the company also said there had been no indicator anything was wrong when the site was checked by a patrol in the early hours of yesterday.

The Elite signs used had been left behind at the car park when it closed earlier this year after Leeds City Council decided not to renew its long stay licence.

As word of the scam spread yesterday morning, drivers began dashing back to the site move their cars amid fears the site could be locked up again with their vehicles still inside.

However, Twenty Four 7 maintained a presence at the site during the afternoon so it could be kept open for latecomers to retrieve their cars.

People who worked at the car park when it was run by Elite raised the alarm after they started receiving calls from their old customers about the reopening.

Packed: Former car park attendant Joe Harding said the site would have quickly filled up if the 'attendants' had continued with their scam

'If the people responsible had continued then the place would have been packed full every day in no time at all,' said Joe Harding, a former parking attendant at the site.

A Leeds City Council spokesman said: 'We understand that someone broke into the site found some old signs left behind by Elite and managed to con a number of motorists into paying for parking.

'As soon as we were alerted we contacted landowner Taylor Wimpey, who were very surprised to find someone illegally using their land and they took immediate steps to re-secure the site.'

A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said the incident had not been reported to officers.
