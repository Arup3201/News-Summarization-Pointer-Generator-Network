The ‘Brad Pitt of chess’ has appeared in a new fashion campaign looking dark and dangerous alongside fellow brainbox Lily Cole.

Denim brand G-Star RAW has created an 'intense' video featuring 22-year-old genius Magnus Carlsen and the flame-haired supermodel inspired by, er, chess.

The unlikely couple enter a fantastical game surrounded by concrete and steel, and a few hundred doppelgangers, while looking hot in their street smart jackets and jeans.

Lily looks fierce in the campaign video as she stares down Magnus in a surreal game of chess

Magnus, whose looks have seen him nicknamed the Brad Pitt of chess, has modelled for the brand before

The video starts with the intellectual beauties squaring off over a chess board, before they are sucked into physically becoming the pieces in the alternative campaign

Lily, 26, and Norwegian Magnus are meant to embody an ominous intellect in the campaign video.

Eco enthusiast Lily graduated with a double first in Art History from Cambridge University and has since kept up a stream of academic and charitable pursuits alongside her modelling and acting career.

Co-star Magnus is the third youngest person in history to gain 
the esteemed title of Grandmaster. He was named the new chess World 
Champion in November 2013 at the World Chess Championship in India, also
 pocketing £1.4 million in prize money.

The brooding European gained his label as the ‘Brad Pitt of chess’
 when Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn captured him in the G- Star AW10 campaign.

He has since been named one of World's Sexiest men in 
2013 by Cosmopolitan magazine alongside Hugh Jackman and Bradley Cooper.

Magnus and Lily are multiplied by CGI

Although perhaps best known for her countless modelling achievements, Lily's flaming hair hides a formidable brainpower

Magnus, seen here looking sultry in the G-star SS14 campaign, was crowned chess World Champion last year at the tender age of 22

Lily, here showing off the SS14 collection, holds a first class degree in Art History from the University of Cambridge
