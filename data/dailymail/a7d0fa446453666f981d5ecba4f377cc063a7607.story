It will cost Crystal Palace £10million for them to convert Wilfried Zaha's loan switch from Manchester United into a permanent one.  

The 22-year-old left Selhurst Park in January 2013 but has returned to his former club on loan after failing to make an impression under both David Moyes and Louis van Gaal at United.

The Eagles are reportedly working on a transfer window deal  that would see them pay a flat £3million fee, plus £3m in add-ons to United if the triggers are met - and the loss of £4m in add-ons written off in the original deal which saw Zaha leave for Old Trafford.

Although Zaha's move to Manchester United was valued at £15m, his failure to reach add-on targets meant the Red Devils should recoup their outlay after paying a down payment of £10m and wages of £35,000-per-week.

After being largely overlooked by previous manager Neil Warnock, Zaha has been given a new lease of life under Alan Pardew  who has used him in all four matches he has taken charge of following his own return.

'I have a smile on my face because I am back on the pitch,' Zaha said.

'There was a period where I thought: 'What is going on here?' But I said to myself that if I got minutes on the pitch I would get better and better. 

'The gaffer has put his trust in me and I am trying to give it back and perform for the team. When I am here, I feel more confident. I have lived in south London all my life and my family is here. 

'I cannot keep that in my head all the time because I could have another move, but Crystal Palace is my home.'
