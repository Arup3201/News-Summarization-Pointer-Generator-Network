Jack Rodwell made his first outing in a Sunderland shirt as late goals from Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham saw the Black Cats win their latest pre-season friendly.

With the game goalless and seemingly staying that way, Fletcher broke the deadlock with a typical poacher's goal with 11 minutes remaining.

Latching on to a loose ball in the box, the Scotland international made no mistake from close range.

Wickham's magnificent strike doubled the lead soon after to give the scoreline a fair reflection of the home side's dominance.

It was a stunning effort from the 21-year-old, firing home from 25 yards to give keeper Antonio Adan no chance.

Elsewhere, Patrick van Aanholt continued to impress for Sunderland, with new signing Santiago Vergini also making his first appearance for the club.

But an injury to Emanuele Giaccherini, who hobbled off just before half-time, will give boss Gus Poyet something to think about.
