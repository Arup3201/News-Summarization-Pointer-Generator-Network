Female Kurdish fighters are the hidden face of Syria's armed rebellion against President Bashar Assad's government forces in Aleppo.

Their battle in the key city comes as the weekend saw bitter fighting in Qusair, a key rebel-held town near the Lebanese border after government troops launched a major operation to strengthen Assad's grip.

Most of the Kurdish female soldiers are young and attractive - some have been part of the Kurdish militia since they were five years old.

'I have been a fighter since I can 
remember and I always will be,' Delar Perlar, the 23-year-old commander 
of the brigade told Sky News.

'I
am here to protect my people, to protect my family first and to make 
sure that the revolution happens, then I will carry on and be part of 
the new Syria,' says Janda Teoplin, a one-year veteran who looks about 
13.

Many of the fighters are bands of sisters - all risking their lives to fight.

In Aleppo there are two known women's brigades and both fight for the rebel side.

In a further complication, Israel could get drawn in - yesterday Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that he is ready to act
if Syria attempts to ship advanced Iranian weapons to Hezbollah, saying
that 'we are prepared for every scenario.'

Earlier this month, Israel struck twice near Damascus, to intercept purported shipments to Hezbollah and now Syria is making preparations to strike Tel Aviv, The Sunday Times reported.

The Syrian army has begun deploying advanced surface-to-surface missiles - they are advanced Tishreen missiles which are capable of carrying a holf-ton warhead. 

The newspaper said that the information was obtained by reconnaissance satellites that were tracking the Syrian forces.

With the regime scoring gains on the battlefield, the U.S. and Russia could face an even tougher task persuading Assad and his opponents to attend talks on ending Syria's 26-month-old conflict.

Washington and Moscow hope to start talks with an international conference as early as next month, though no date has been set.

Talks: But with the regime scoring gains on the battlefield, the U.S. and Russia could face an even tougher task persuading Assad and his opponents to attend talks on ending Syria's 26-month-old conflict.

Government forces launched the 
offensive on the town of Qusair just hours after Assad said in a 
newspaper interview that he'll stay in his job until elections - 
effectively rejecting an opposition demand that any talks on a political
transition lead to his ouster.

Even
though the regime and the main opposition group have not yet committed 
to attending the conference, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said 
Sunday that he is hopeful it can take place 'very soon,' possibly in 
early June.

In addition to the U.S. and Russia, he said he has spoken with Britain, France, China and other key parties.

Previous
diplomatic initiatives have failed, in part because of divisions within
the international community and because the regime and the armed 
opposition believed they could achieve more on the battlefield than in 
talks. Russia and the U.S. have backed opposite sides in Syria.

Still,
neither regime forces nor rebel fighters have been able to create 
significant momentum since the uprising against Assad erupted in March 
2011 and last year escalated into a full-fledged civil war.

The rebels control large rural areas 
in the north and east of the country, while Assad has successfully 
defended his hold on the capital, Damascus, the coastal area and parts 
of Aleppo, Syria's largest city.

Before
Sunday's offensive, Qusair had been ringed by regime troops and 
fighters from the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, an Assad ally, for several
weeks.

Qusair lies 
along a land corridor between Damascus and the Mediterranean coast, the 
heartland of Assad's Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.

Many rebel fighters are Sunni Muslims
and Qusair, overwhelmingly Sunni, had served as a conduit for shipments
of weapons and supplies smuggled from Lebanon to the rebels.

Hadi
Abdullah, a Qusair activist reached by Skype, said regime troops and 
Hezbollah fighters began shelling the town late Saturday, followed by 
airstrikes early Sunday that sent residents taking cover in basements.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said warplanes resumed bombing raids later Sunday. 

By Sunday afternoon, regime forces 
had advanced into the town, engaging in house-to-house battles with 
rebel fighters, Abdullah said.

Syrian
state media said Assad's troops took control of the main square, the 
area around the municipal building, a sports stadium and a local church.
Syrian state TV said troops arrested rebel fighters who tried to flee 
Qusair dressed as civilians.

A
government official said the regime left an escape road open to 
civilians, a claim denied by Abdullah, who said thousands of 
noncombatants were trapped in Qusair. 'We tried to get civilians out 
four times.

They are not allowing us,' he said of regime forces.

The Observatory said 52 people were killed in Qusair, including 48 fighters, three women and a male civilian.

Abdullah said the air raids destroyed
at least 17 houses. A field hospital was damaged last week, leaving the
town with only one medical center which was unable to handle the influx
of some 400 wounded Sunday, he said.

The
main political opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, said 
some 40,000 civilians are currently in Qusair and expressed concern for 
their safety. It urged the international community to step in to protect
the lives of the civilians and called on the U.N. Security Council to 
denounce Hezbollah's involvement in the attack.

Six mortar rounds, apparently fired 
from Qusair, struck in nearby Lebanon, causing damage to a carpentry 
shop where a fire broke out, Lebanese security officials said. There 
were no reports of casualties.

In
the northern Lebanese port city of Tripoli, clashes erupted between 
residents of a predominantly Alawite area and a majority Sunni 
neighborhood, Lebanon's National News Agency reported. It said at least 
five people were wounded in the fighting.

Events in Syria often raise tension among rival sects in neighboring Lebanon, particularly in Tripoli.

The Qusair offensive was just the latest indicator that the joint U.S.-Russian diplomatic initiative faces challenges.

Russia, despite its stated commitment to Syria peace talks, has reportedly delivered an advanced version of its Yakhont anti-ship cruise missiles to Syria, prompting U.S. complaints last week about an 'ill-timed' step. Russia is a key political ally and arms supplier of the Assad regime, along with Iran.

The Obama administration, meanwhile, wants to avoid getting drawn into the Syria quagmire, despite pressure to find a way to end the bloodletting that has left more than 70,000 dead. U.S. concerns have been heightened by the growing dominance of Islamic militants among the fighters, including those linked to the al-Qaida terror network.

'For the U.S., (the conference) is mostly about postponing the tough decision-making Obama has been loath to get himself involved in, because he fears Syria will suck him in,' said Peter Harling, a Syria expert at the International Crisis Group think tank.

Meanwhile an international aid organization is appealing for more funds to help Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan, saying warmer weather will increase health risks due to lack of shelter, water and basic sanitation.

Oxfam says it needs  £34million ($53 million) to improve access to water and proper sanitation for Syrian refugees.

The Britain-based group said in a statement that diarrhea and skin infections have already been noted among refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.

More than 100 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis, also known as the Aleppo boil, have been diagnosed in private clinics in the past two weeks.

If left untreated, the festering boil, can grow to a weeping wound several centimetres in diameter. It is caused by a single-cell parasite that is transmitted by sandfly. Access to medicine, clean water and good hygiene practices are critical to help treat these infections.

The two countries host the bulk of 1.5 million Syrians who have fled the civil war at home, seeking shelter in neighboring countries.

Oxfam says it needs the funds quickly as temperatures are expected to soar in the region in the coming weeks.
