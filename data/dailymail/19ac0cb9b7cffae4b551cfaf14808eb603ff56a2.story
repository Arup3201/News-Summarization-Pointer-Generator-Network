Allegations: Dr Chuma Igbowke, Niger's official consul to Britain, is said to have made indecent proposals to a woman at a private hospital

An African diplomat working as a doctor in Britain sexually harassed and exposed himself to a secretary, an employment tribunal heard today.

Dr Chuma Igbokwe, 45, is accused of making indecent proposals to administrator Vanessa Turley at a private hospital.

The Republic of Niger’s official consul to Britain allegedly called 40-year-old Mrs Turley into his office and asked her if the locks on the door could be undone from the outside.

When she told him they couldn’t, the hearing was told, the married doctor replied: ‘I want to **** over a desk.’

The tribunal also heard that Mrs Turley’s husband later received emails – later identified as being sent from Africa – claiming his wife was ‘a porn star, a prostitute and had been having affairs with men at work’.

Mrs Turley, a mother-of-three, was left ‘totally shocked’ at her colleague’s behaviour at a private mental hospital, it was said.

Launching a claim for unfair dismissal citing sexual harassment and bullying, she told the tribunal: ‘He called me into his office and asked if the locks on the door could be overridden.

‘I replied that I didn't think they could and he said: “Because I want to f*** you over the desk.”’

She continued: ‘I was left totally shocked and told him he should not say things of that nature as it was bad.

‘My treatment after that was unbearable - each time he visited the hospital he was rude and very abrupt to me.’

Mrs Turley then described how qualified psychiatrist Dr Igbokwe made a graphic sexual request to her in the ‘mayor’s parlour’ during a formal dinner held to mark the success of St Luke's Hospital in Ebbw Vale, South Wales.

She told the tribunal: ‘This was disgusting and I couldn't believe he said it. I ignored him and turned away.’

Mrs Turley also told the tribunal of an incident when the doctor asked her into his office.

She said: ‘He held my hips from behind, thrusting himself against me and told me to sit down.

‘I was scared. He sat in the chair and was fumbling with his trouser fly zip.

‘He stood in front of me preventing me from moving, exposed himself and gestured for me to perform a sexual act on him.

‘I pushed him aside and made haste to the door.’

She also alleged he would ask her to meet him at the Hilton Hotel in Newport.

Mrs Turley did not complain to bosses at Essex-based St Luke's Health Group because, she said: ‘I was scared of him because he had such power.

‘He was the consul for Niger, he is a company director and chairman of various companies. How could I stand up against him?’

The tribunal in Cardiff heard Mrs Turley was demoted and after quitting her job in June last year went to the police to report her former boss.

She told the tribunal: ‘My home life was suffering and my marriage was breaking down due to the stress. I was subjected to his bullying and victimised for up to a year.’

As well as the email claiming Mrs Turley was a prostitute, the tribunal was told her husband received another with a link to an internet porn site and a third one stating: ‘Now we know the truth about our star performers.’

The calls were traced by a computer expert friend of Mrs Turley's who discovered one was from Niger and another from a Sheridan Hotel in Nigeria.

Dr Igbokwe is a founder and executive director of Mild Professional Homes, which is run by the St Luke's group.

At the time of the alleged harassment, Dr Igbokwe was Niger's UK consul but he has now stepped down from the position.

The tribunal heard Dr Igbokwe has been suspended by the General Medical Council who are investigating other complaints of sexual harassment against him.

Mrs Turley is claiming unfair dismissal, sexual discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation against Dr Igbokwe and St Luke's Heath Care Group.

They deny the case.

The tribunal, expected to last three days, continues.
