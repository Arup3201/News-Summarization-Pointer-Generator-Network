Warning: Lord Robert Winston, the geneticist and Labour peer, said there was a ‘risk’ the new Bill could lead to treatments which could do harm to people rather than improving their lives

Plans to allow terminally-ill patients to be given untested treatments without proper safeguards were branded ‘dangerous’ by a top scientist last night.

Lord Robert Winston, the geneticist and Labour peer, said there was a ‘risk’ it could lead to treatments which could do harm to people rather than improving their lives.

But another peer, Lord Blencathra, who has multiple sclerosis, made an impassioned plea for the law to be changed, saying he was willing to try innovative jobs which could improve his quality of life.

Lord Maurice Saatchi, the former marketing expert for Margaret Thatcher, has introduced a Bill in the House of Lords aimed at allowing some people dying of cancer to be voluntarily treated with unlicensed drugs.

It gained government backing earlier this week after further safeguards were proposed requiring doctors to get the agreement of another specialist in prescribing drugs.

But the medical and legal professions are divided over the measure and the Tory advertising mogul faces an uphill struggle with nearly 40 amendments tabled to the Medical Innovation Bill.

Lord Saatchi has been campaigning for law changes to enable more innovation in treatment since his wife, novelist Josephine Hart, died from a form of ovarian cancer in 2011.

Yesterday, he denied that the legislation could give comfort to ‘quacks or cowboys’ and insisted that with the new safeguards it would provide greater certainty to doctors, helping them to innovate.

The Bill would give legal protection to doctors who want to try different procedures or treatments when they have exhausted other options.

But Lord Winston warned that as currently drafted, the proposals would increase uncertainty and would create a lack of clarity, adding: ‘The Bill as it stands is quite a dangerous Bill.’

He said his medical career had been based on consistent innovation and Lord Saatchi was mistaken if he thought practitioners were concerned about the risk of litigation in trying new treatments.

‘The risk is that if we encourage innovation, as we are inclined to do and as is happening in private practice at the moment for quite large fees, there is a real risk in the long term,’ he said.

As an example, he pointed to the decision of two internet companies which have offered to freeze the eggs of their employees to try to delay their childbearing.

This could lead to the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, osteoporosis or dementia among older mums who take up the offer and have children late in life.

Labour’s Lord Turnberg, a former professor of medicine, warned the Bill as currently drafted left open ‘to too great a degree the potential for harm by unorthodox, unregulated practitioners’ and called for the safeguards to be tightened.

Lord Saatchi said he was happy to hold talks with peers on the Bill’s provisions before the next stage of debate.

‘I am trying to deliver an Act Of Parliament which is simple, completely straightforward and totally clear - providing clarity and certainty at the point of treatment, both to the doctor and the patient, he said.

Tory former minister Lord Blencathra, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, said: ‘I suspect that I am typical of many who will try any innovative treatment. I am 16 days into a treatment with a new drug, Fampridine, which is approved for use in this country but only, I think, in the national neurological hospital in the wonderful Queen Square.

‘At the moment there is no cure for MS but these innovative treatments are making life better. After just 16 days of my experimental treatment, I certainly feel a marginal improvement—at least I am not declining further.

‘That may be the only hope one can offer many people—not that we can fix them but we will make the quality of their lives better for the long term and we will try to hold the disease at bay.’
