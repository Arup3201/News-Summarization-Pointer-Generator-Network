Shelling out: The Department spent more than £1.2m on flights between May 2010 and February 2012 when Chris Huhne was in charge

Ministers and officials at the ‘green’
 department for energy and climate change have clocked up a bill of over
 £1.5 million for nearly 3,500 flights since the coalition came to 
power.

More than ten per cent of the flights - 362 - were business class but they made up over a third of a cost - £600,000.

DECC shelled out for business class 
for 32 domestic flights to short-haul destinations such as Glasgow and 
even Manchester, both easily accessible by train.

The department spent £250,000 on 1,228
 domestic flights in two and a half years to destinations that are often
 easily reachable by train.

The department is tasked with 
including air travel in the European Union Emissions Trading System - 
which makes flights more costly for those paying out of their own 
pockets.

Most of the costs were amassed while 
former Lib Dem Cabinet Minister, Chris Huhne, was in charge. The 
department clocked up £1,227,429 in costs during his reign from May 2010
 until February 2012.

DECC also paid £460 for a flight to 
Aberdeen according to the figures, unearthed by the Taxpayers Alliance 
in a Freedom of Information request to the department.

The huge costs led the Taxpayers 
Alliance to label the flights as a ‘extravagant waste’ and an 
‘breath-taking hypocrisy’ for the department which is meant to champion 
cuts to greenhouse gases.

The figures also showed that 3,017 flights were taken in economy class at a cost of £835,000.

Business class flights were also 
booked from London to cities in Europe such as Budapest (£699), Berlin 
(£474), Madrid (£271) and Cologne (£370).

A bill of £500 was racked up for flying first class, from London to Lisbon - despite it breaching the department’s own policy.

Despite its ‘eco-friendly’ 
credentials, the department also embarked on air travel to far-flung 
destinations such as Auckland, Cape Town, Jakarta, Washington, New York,
 Nairobi, Tokyo and Hong Kong.

These long-haul destinations cost more than £4000 each in flight costs alone.

The costliest flight was £5,792 from Cancun to London.

A London to Cape Town jaunt cost £5,396, while two flights to Santiago cost £5,190 each.

Some £123,551 was spent on 116 ‘premium economy’ flights.

DECC has a headcount of 1,286 staff, which works out to three flights per employee.

Anger: Matthew Sinclair said the report showed 'extravagant waste from a department which can¿t be trusted with more and more of our money, while others work hard to make savings'

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of 
the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Despite being one of the departments 
making air travel more expensive for people paying their own way, the 
Department of Energy and Climate has spent an astonishing amount of 
taxpayers’ money on flights.

‘This looks like breath-taking 
hypocrisy and extravagant waste from a department which can’t be trusted
 with more and more of our money, while others work hard to make 
savings.’

He added: ‘Officials urgently need to 
explain why they spend so much money on so many business class flights 
in particular. If Ministers can’t provide a satisfactory explanation for
 the number and cost of the air fares their department is racking up, 
then there have to be serious sanctions for officials who have left 
taxpayers with such an unfair bill.’

The department defended its extensive air travel.

A DECC spokesman said: ‘The 
department’s international work, which includes securing the nation’s 
future energy supplies, carrying out negotiations with other countries 
and international organisations on energy and climate change issues, and
 regulating the North Sea oil and gas industry among other things, means
 that sometimes air travel is unavoidable.

He added: ‘Any such travel is for 
business purposes only, and we are careful to ensure that the most 
cost-effective and suitable flights are identified.

‘This Government has never said people
 who care about climate change must not fly: it’s not surprising that 
for some journeys, especially over very long distances when time is a 
factor, flying is the common sense option.’

DECC also has staff based in Aberdeen 
and the spokesman said it was easier to fly there as a train took seven 
hours one way and a return trip would ‘take up two working days’.
