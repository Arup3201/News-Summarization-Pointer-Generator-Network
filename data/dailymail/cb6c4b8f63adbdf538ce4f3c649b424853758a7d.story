As the height of summer approaches, many beachgoers may not realise that a hidden threat lies in the sand and water.

Seagull droppings have been linked to rising levels of E.coli bacteria found on beaches, and to solve the problem a team of scientists have turned to an unusual source - border collies. 

Last summer, the dogs were employed to walk up and down the beaches in Michigan to chase the gulls away, and following tests, bacteria levels were found to have ‘significantly’ dropped.

E. coli, also known as Escherichia coli, is the name of a germ, or bacterium, that lives in the digestive tracts of humans and animals.

There are many types of E. coli, and most of them are harmless.

But some can cause bloody diarrhoea, while others, in particular a strain called O157:H7, may also cause severe anaemia or kidney failure.

There are also strains of E. coli that cause urinary tract infections.

People can get an E. coli infection by coming into contact with the faeces of humans or animals.

This can happen by drinking or eating contaminated food.

Researchers from Central Michigan University reported the findings at the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology.

Gull faeces was named as one source of the bacteria, which in recent years has led to beaches being closed and people advised not to swim.

In addition, gull droppings may contain other bacteria that have the potential to cause human disease, according to researcher Elizabeth Alm.

At the beginning of last summer, 656ft (200-metre) sections of beach were assigned to be either dog-treated beaches, or control beaches.

Half way through the summer, the beach sections were swapped - so the dogs were moved to the control beaches and the previous ‘dog beaches’ were left untreated.

During the summers of 2012 and 2013, researchers recorded the number of gulls at each beach section.

During the dog tests, samples of beach water and beach sand were collected once a week, and the numbers of E. coli in the samples was counted.

In
 early summer, samples from beaches where dogs had been used to get rid 
of the gulls had significantly lower E. coli counts compared to control 
beaches.

‘Border collies are
 intelligent dogs that love to work and could be used by beach managers 
as part of a comprehensive management strategy to reduce bacterial 
contamination at public beaches,’ said Alm.
