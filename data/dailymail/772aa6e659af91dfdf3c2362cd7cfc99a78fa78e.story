They say you 'Gotta go to Mo's', but it would appear that Mo's gotta go to Dick's!

The CEO of Modells, a sporting goods chain who once appeared on the TV show 'Undercover Boss' pretended to be an executive from a rival company in an effort to get confidential information, according to a lawsuit.

Dick's Sporting Goods claims in a lawsuit filed Feb. 20 in Mercer County Court that Mitchell Modell, CEO of Modell's Sporting Goods, showed up at a Dick's store in Princeton in February saying he was a Dick's senior vice president.

Dick's alleges Modell told employees he was to meet the Dick's CEO there and persuaded workers to show him the backroom of the store and to answer questions about the business.

Modell gathered information about online sales, including a 'ship from store' program that gets products to customers' doors quickly, the lawsuit said.

Retailers spy on each other all the time. In his autobiography, Sam Walton writes about covert shopping trips to keep tabs on rivals like Kmart and Price Club.

'Ever since retailers first started having cash registers, retailers have scouted each other's stores,' said Burt Flickinger III, president of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group.

But if the lawsuit's allegations are true, this appears to be a particularly egregious case. It is rare that a CEO would actually get caught misrepresenting himself to store employees, experts say.

Trade war: Modell allegedly told a store manager he had an appointment to meet Dick's CEO Edward Stack at the store and convinced employees to show him around the store's private back areas and answer questions about store operations

Undercover boss: What retail experts find particularly baffling about the complaint is how Modell, a highly visible CEO, thought he wouldn't be recognized. Here he is seen when he legitimately went undercover for the CBS TV program

'What happens all day every day is retailers go to their competitors' stores and probably and certainly don't disclose who they are,' said RBC Capital Markets analyst Sean McGowan. 'But I can't think of any instances where a retailer represents he is an executive to gain access.'

Dick's accuses its rival of civil conspiracy and trespass and is seeking attorneys' fees and a judge's order to prevent Modell and his workers from entering nonpublic areas of Dick's stores or posing as employees.

Modell's spokesman Jason Karlowski says he couldn't comment immediately but would be able to answer questions later Friday.

In 2012, Mitchell Modell shaved his head and put on an oversized mustache to pose as a low-level employee on the CBS show 'Undercover Boss.' He later said the experience taught him how physically demanding warehouse work was and led to staffing and workload changes throughout the company.

His New York-based chain has more than 150 stores, mostly in the Northeast. Dick's, based in Pittsburgh, is a publicly traded company with more than 550 stores nationwide.

Pending litigation: Modell's, a family-owned business founded in 1889 and based in New York, has more than 150 stores in 11 states, primarily in the Northeast. Dick's has more than 550 stores in 46 states

Let him in: In a complaint filed in Mercer County Court Feb. 20, Dick's Sporting Goods claims Modell visited one of its stores in Princeton on Feb. 8 and pretended to be a senior vice president of Dick's who was collecting information about the store

Lawsuit: Dick's is seeking unspecified financial compensation for damages, and a ruling that would bar Modell (pictured) or any of his employees from making future visits to the non-public areas of a Dick's store or using the information gained from Modell's February visit
