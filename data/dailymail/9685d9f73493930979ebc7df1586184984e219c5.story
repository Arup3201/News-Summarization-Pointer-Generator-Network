A British dance teacher shot dead by his son-in-law, who was also his former lover, may have molested at least four boys while running a dance school in Suffolk, it has emerged.

Police have investigated four alleged victims who say they were abused in the 1980s and 1990s by Scott Rogers, who was killed in the US after becoming a local television celebrity there.

Three of the men claiming that Rogers attacked them have only come forward after he was shot dead in August by Mathew Hodgkinson, who also killed himself.

Investigation: Scott Rogers is accused of molesting at least four young boys while living in Britain

Rogers - known as Richard Scott-Rogers when he lived in Britain - was charged with abusing the other boy more than 20 years ago, but was cleared in 1993 after a trial.

Before he moved to the US, Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, which was described as a 'supposedly religious cult' by the local council.

Rogers allegedly held 'sleepovers' with young students, where he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags', according to parents.

He then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he hosted a weekend morning TV show called Around Town, making him a minor celebrity in the area.

But in August last year, Rogers, 52, was murdered by Mathew Hodgkinson, a former lover of his who had married his daughter Kimmy as part of an immigration scam.

Hodgkinson, 36, then turned the gun on himself, and died in hospital eight days later.

After Rogers' death, Suffolk Police appealed for any victims to come forward, and were contacted by three men who said they were abused at the dance school in Bury St Edmunds.

The force, working with officers from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree, recorded their claims and referred them to specialist agencies which support child abuse victims.

However, they will not be able to take any further action because Rogers' death means the investigation has now been closed.

A Suffolk Police crime report uncovered by a MailOnline freedom of information request said: 'Three new victims of child abuse reported to the Suffolk police sexual abuse by Richard Scott-Rogers.

'These historic incidents were recorded as notifiable crimes. Police provided support to these victims. There are no further lines of enquiry to complete in relation to the investigation with no other parties involvement.

'Given the suspect had died these crimes are therefore finalised in accordance with Home Office crime recording outcomes.'

The three new victims brings the total number of British complainants to four, including the boy who made the original abuse claims in the 1990s.

Following Rogers' death, it emerged that the authorities had recently taken away his adopted 10-year-old son and two-year-old foster son after finding out about his past.

He was due to give evidence to a grand jury on the day he was killed, after police discovered that he had lied on the forms he used to apply to become a foster parent.

Note: Hodgkinson left this note after killing Rogers and then shooting himself

Hodgkinson wrote an apparent suicide note found in the home he shared with his wife and father-in-law, saying: 'They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too.'

Soon after Rogers was killed, two anonymous British men appeared on a radio show and accused him of molesting them when they were young boys.

One of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at the dance academy, claimed to have been abused from the age of 13.

It is not known whether the men who made those claims are the same as the complainants who have contacted the police.
