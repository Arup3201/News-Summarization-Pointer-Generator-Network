Never mind Mr Selfridge, the hit series chronicling the early years of the great department store.

Another retail empire, which began further along London's Oxford Street from Selfridges, and much earlier, has an even more beguiling story.

John Lewis is 150 years old this year, and its rich history is celebrated in an exhibition at the flagship Oxford Street store.

John Lewis celebrates 150 years of business this year

Were anyone to make a TV drama about John Lewis, it might include the aviator Amy Johnson, the murderer Dr Crippen and the wartime code-breaker Hugh Alexander.

They all feature in the fascinating tale of how a single draper's shop grew into a high street institution that is part and neatly wrapped parcel of Britain's consumer culture.

The middle classes in particular have for generations been reliant on the John Lewis Partnership, as it became, and of course on Waitrose, the string of grocer's shops that were gathered into the John Lewis fold in 1937.

Many of us were almost literally weaned on John Lewis. In the exhibition there stands a handsome Silver Cross pram, which might be a replica of the one that transported me 50-odd years ago.

My elderly mother still recalls going to John Lewis, in the form of its Liverpool outpost George Henry Lee, to buy a Silver Cross for me. And the great childhood treat for my Yorkshire wife Jane, brought up in Barnsley, was being taken for fancy afternoon teas at Sheffield's branch of John Lewis, Cole Brothers.

Maybe it helps to be over 50, but there must be millions of Britons for whom memories of John Lewis

and its grand provincial outposts offer such stabs of nostalgia.

The story begins with John Lewis himself, born to a baker and his wife in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, in 1836.

He was apprenticed to a draper in nearby Glastonbury, but made his way to London and found a job in Oxford Circus with another draper, Peter Robinson, whose name would also become familiar to generations of British shoppers. In time Robinson offered Lewis a partnership, but Lewis declined and, in 1864, aged 28, he set up his own draper's shop, also on Oxford Street.

He crammed his shop window with silks, laces, ribbons and bows, which he'd bought cheaply so he could sell cheaply. That was his simple retailing philosophy.

He reduced his overheads further by opting not to advertise, and the empire he founded would largely eschew mainstream advertising for more than a century. Now, of course, John Lewis campaigns, such as the charming 'The Hare & the Bear' commercials last Christmas, have themselves become iconic in their own right.

There were other ways in which old man Lewis kept his costs down. The exhibition is on the third floor of the flagship store, to which I ascended by lift. But not all Victorian shoppers were so fortunate. The company's archivist, Gavin Henderson, told me that when the first lift was installed in 1893, Lewis used to stand nearby, mindful that it cost him a penny-farthing every time the new apparatus carried customers up or down.

'So he would assess their physical state, and if he thought they were fit enough, he'd send them up the stairs.'

By the 1890s the shop had become much more than a draper's, but in 1906 Lewis bought an established department store, Peter Jones in Chelsea. Jones, another enterprising provincial draper, had died the year before and Lewis seized his chance, walking the couple of miles from Oxford Street to Sloane Square with 20 £1,000 notes in his pocket to make the purchase in cash.

In that same year, 1906, Lewis gave his 21-year-old son John Spedan Lewis a quarter share of the business. Spedan (he was always known by his middle name) had many radical management ideas - such as cutting hours and introducing tea-breaks - that were at odds with his father's unyielding Victorian principles.

He was grudgingly allowed to put some of them into practice at Peter Jones, where he was made chairman.  

But Spedan was not the only enlightened retailer in London. In 1909 the American Harry Gordon Selfridge opened his own department store, and allowed customers to wander round his magnificent premises unguided.

This was revolutionary: at other department stores shoppers were escorted by floorwalkers who would introduce them to a sales assistant. Old Mr Lewis would not countenance Selfridge's way of doing things, and he had similarly old-fashioned ideas about employment practices.

In 1920, 400 of his staff went on strike for better pay and conditions, but Lewis simply sacked and replaced them. When he died in 1928, aged 92, his son took the reins. It was no coincidence that the John Lewis Partnership was inaugurated the following year, where profits were divided between the entire workforce, now known as 'Partners'.

Spedan also introduced one of the first graduate training schemes. He liked to recruit 'learners' himself according to their chess skills, and one of the finest players he recruited, Hugh Alexander, was later seconded to Bletchley Park to help break the Nazi Enigma code.

Another of Spedan's young graduates was Amy Johnson, taken on in 1928 as a sales assistant and later to gain fame as a record-breaking aviator.    

Due to Spedan's clever recruitment the John Lewis Partnership prospered even while the rest of the nation's economy suffered terribly in the 1930s. Spedan planned a chain of John Lewis hotels, and in 1937 bought a string of ten grocery shops in the London area to supply them.

This was Waitrose, which had been founded by Messrs Waite, Rose and Taylor in 1908; Taylor bailed out of the partnership early, denying himself a place in the annals of British food retailing. Arthur Rose was the accounts man. The visionary was Wallace Waite, a self-made grocer who by coincidence had been a pupil at Shepton Mallet Grammar, like John Lewis before him.

Waitrose quickly added to the Partnership's success, although there was a setback in 1940 when the flagship John Lewis store was all but destroyed by German bombs.

Spedan's expansion plans continued unabated however, and that same year the Partnership acquired a controlling interest in the ailing Selfridge Provincial Stores, a group of 15 department stores Selfridge had set up in the 1920s - they included George Henry Lee, Jones Brothers on Holloway Road, north London, and Caleys of Windsor, where 'Madame' Caley herself once made hats for Queen Victoria (and which remained milliner by royal warrant until it closed eight years ago).

In 1910 Jones Brothers helped seal the conviction of Dr Crippen, on trial at the Old Bailey for murdering his wife. Human remains had been found at his home in north London, but he claimed they dated from before he lived there.

However, they were found buried with pieces of a man's pyjama jacket bearing a Jones Brothers label, and the shop's menswear buyer testified that those pyjamas had not been introduced until 1908, well after Crippen had moved in.

Today we're all familiar with the white and green company colours, chosen it's said because Spedan wrote his thousands of memos in green ink. He was also said to be domineering and autocratic, but nevertheless he remains, like his father before him, an authentic hero of the British high street.
