Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-ah could face three years in prison for her notorious 'nut rage' incident after which she was accused of treating staff as 'feudal slaves'.

The 40-year-old, who had an in-flight tantrum over how she was served macadamia nuts in December before take off at New York City's JFK airport, defended her actions citing her devotion to work during the final day of testimony today.

The daughter of Korean Air's chairman has been in custody since December 30 and was charged with forcing a flight to change its normal route and which carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.

She also faces three other charges including the use of violence against flight crew, hindering a government probe and forcing the flight's purser off the plane. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. 

However, the South Korean prosecutors' recommendation of three years in prison comes after they said Cho led the airline's systematic efforts to cover up the incident, compelled employees to lie to government investigators and discredited and blamed the chief flight attendant.

Prosecutors recommended three years in prison for Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-ah (above) for her notorious 'nut rage' incident that caused an uproar in South Korea

Cho, the daughter of Korean Air's chairman, defended her actions as the result of devotion to work. Pictured above, a bus carrying Cho arrived for the final day of testimony at the Seoul Western District Court in Seoul today

She backed up her actions and said that cabin crew in first class had made a mistake by not following proper procedures, Seoul Western District Court heard.

During the incident which occurred on December 5, Park Chang-jin, the chief flight attendant, was ordered off the plane by angry Cho, following a heated confrontation with cabin crew because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a dish.

Furious that he had not followed protocol, she screamed at Park and told him to bring out the company’s in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines.

When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him off the flight. 

Without giving the 250 passengers on board a warning, the Incheon-bound plane was forced to return to the gate at John F Kennedy Airport in New York. The Airbus A380 eventually arrived in South Korea 11 minutes late. 

In court, Park said he and other staff were treated like 'feudal slaves' by the heiress.

Cho, who has been in custody since December 30, made a grovelling apology (above) where she bowed her head in shame and said she was 'sorry' following the incident

And a statement from one crew member described Cho as behaving like an 'angry tiger' during the incident.

Cho did admit to using violence against one flight attendant by pushing her shoulder and throwing an object at her.

She also said she did not realize the chief flight attendant has law enforcement authority during the flight and that by ordering the chief flight attendant off the plane was consequently a risk to safety. The 'final call' about returning to the gate was made by the captain, said Cho.

'I think this case happened because of devotion to my work and because I could not be considerate to other people,' she said.

The 40-year-old's 'nut rage' tantrum caused an uproar in South Korea where the economy is dominated by family-run conglomerates known as 'chaebol' that often act above the law. She resigned from her role as executive vice president

Her 'nut rage' tantrum also caused an uproar in South Korea where the economy is dominated by family-run conglomerates known as 'chaebol' that often act above the law.

Macadamia nut sales rose following Cho Hyun-ah's 'nut rage' tantrum.

Auction, a South Korean unit of eBay and South Korea's second-largest e-commerce website, said last December that sales of macadamias surged nearly 12-fold without any promotions.

It also said macadamias previously made up five per cent of its nut sales but said (at the time) they were accounting for almost half. 

Last week, cabin crew told the court they were pressured by Korean Air executives to cover up the incident and to lie to investigators.

Prosecutors said they are seeking a two-year prison sentence for Yeo Woon-jin, the Korean Air executive accused of pressuring cabin crew to cover up the incident and to lie to investigators from South Korea's transport ministry.

They also called for two years in prison for Kim Woon-sub, a transport ministry official and former Korean Air executive accused of leaking secrets about the ministry's investigation.

Following the incident last December, Cho made a grovelling apology where she bowed her head in shame and admitted in a trembling voice that she was 'sorry'. 

Adding to her humiliation, her father and airline chairman Cho Yang-ho called her behavior 'foolish' and said that he regretted that he did not raise her better.

He added that his eldest child would resign from her role as executive vice president and executive roles at all affiliates of Hanjin, the group that controls Korean Air.

Cho's lawyers have not disputed the major elements of the prosecutor's account of events, and instead have focused on a technical rebuttal of the charges. 

This has included trying to demonstrate flight attendants did not know proper service procedures.

On the most serious charge of changing a flight's route, they argued events fell short of that definition because the plane was only meters from the gate when it turned around.

The three trial judges are expected to announce their verdicts before Lunar New Year holidays this month.
