Queen of Shops Mary Portas has condemned the Government over a decision to allow Tesco to build a vast new supermarket on the seafront at Margate.

The retail guru, who was hired by David Cameron to find ways to rescue dying town centres like Margate, described the decision as ‘a very sad day’.

She has become an outspoken champion of small retailers and fought to try and revive town centres ravaged by the impact of large supermarkets.

However, she has effectively been overruled by the equally combative Eric Pickles, the Secretary for communities and local government, who has approved the Margate scheme.

The new Tesco, which had been fought by local residents and traders, will be a massive 82,000 square feet and sit on what is a key site on the seafront.

The news will confirm suspicions that the original decision to hire Portas was more of a publicity stunt than a genuine attempt to help struggling high streets.

For her key recommendations, which included cutting business rates and putting a brake on new shopping centres, have both been rejected.

Rather a penny-pinching and lack lustre funding scheme, called the Portas Pilots, has been set up to give small grants to a few town centre committees to support things like local markets.

Last night, she condemned Mr Pickles’ decision to back the scheme, saying: ‘This is a sad day for Margate. 

‘The time, energy and genuine care the people of Margate have put into rebuilding their high street is being completely undermined by the Secretary of State, Eric Pickles MP who has signed off an 82,000 square feet edge-of-town Tesco development.

‘If Government really believes in town centre first, how can they do this?’

She was selected by the Prime Minister to front a review of high streets on the strength of her record as a Channel 4 TV presenter, where she was shown helping small independent traders turn around failing businesses.

However, it is clear that she has been left disappointed by the outcome of an initiative that has been dismissed by retail industry experts as mere window dressing.

‘I did this in between running a business, in between filming and having a family. You try your best…I just wish I had been better advised,’ she said.

In April, Miss Portas accused the former Tesco boss, Sir Terry Leahy, of talking ‘crap’ when he described the rise of supermarkets as progress.

She said: ‘That's absolutely crap. What happens is that 50p of every pound is spent on food. If you take that off the high street and put it into a 40,000ft out-of-town store and you provide free parking and everything under one roof, then you start to take away not only the food shops, but also the chemist, the fashion shops, the butcher… you start to displace the whole high street.’

One episode of her Channel 4 TV series ‘Mary Queen of the High Street’ involved focusing on Margate and breathing new life in to its shopping streets.

Last year, she told residents she was keen to help their fight against Tesco, saying she was ‘passionate’ about the effects of big stores diverting business away from high streets.

Miss Portas wrote to Mr Pickles last year urging him to reject the Tesco plan which she described it as a ‘disturbing threat’ to Margate.

Retail expert, Bill Grimsey, the former chief executive of Wickes, described the news on Twitter as a ‘Slap in the face for Portas’.

Local trader Robin Vaughn-Lyons, former chairman of the Margate Town Team, said he feared a lot of smaller businesses could end up closing as a result of the new Tesco.

‘I don't think it's good for our seafront at all... I'm sure it's going to take business away from coffee shops, local cafes, and things like that,’ he said.

Designer Wayne Hemingway is at the forefront of a campaign to redevelop Margate’s seafront around a heritage-themed amusement park. The new Tesco store would sit alongside this and could, in theory, wreck the design.

Mr Hemingway said he hoped Tesco could be persuaded to give its store a vintage feel. ‘We will kick them in the b******* until they say they will,’ he said.

A letter to the developers from Mr Pickles’ department said the supermarket plan was ‘acceptable’ and ‘would perform the economic, social and environmental roles of sustainable development towards which it aims’.

While the Government has given its approval, the application is still at the centre of a judicial review supported by residents which could overturn the decision.

Tesco said: ‘Tesco is a tenant in this developer-led project. The developer’s application is now subject to a judicial review. We look forward to the outcome.’
