This is the Transfer Column, where Sportsmail delivers the very latest news, gossip and rumours from around the football world three times a week.

In this column, Real Madrid's Fabio Coentrao could be available to Man United for £12.5million, Spurs, in turn, want United left-back Alexander Buttner and Arsenal are in a three-way battle with Barcelona and Juventus for goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

Manchester United have been encouraged to bid for Real Madrid left-back Fabio Coentrao with the Spanish club prepared to take a 50 per cent hit on the £25million fee they paid for him.

Coentrao was the subject of a loan bid from United at the 11th hour of the summer transfer window. The deal fell through but the player has endured a tough time suffering a hamstring injury while with the Portugal national side and losing his father in November.

He is eager to make a fresh start and a move to Old Trafford appeals.

The main man? Man United are being urged to bid for out-of-favour Real Madrid left-back Fabio Coentrao

United will not move for Leighton Baines in January. Manager David Moyes remains a fan but Everton's £15million valuation and Baines's age, 29, do not make good business sense.

Baines would have to ask for a transfer for the deal to have any chance of being revived and that will not happen. Everton will now look at fresh talks over a new deal for the England international.

United's concern over Coentrao is the fact he hasn't played many games, having appeared just four times in La Liga this season. However, he returned to training yesterday and is fit to play.

No longer required: Everton's Leighton Baines is not Manchester United's principal left-back target

United have watched Alberto Moreno at Sevilla, who Real Madrid also like, and Domenico Criscito at Zenit St Petersburg while Luke Shaw of Southampton is a talent they would like to sign. Chelsea, though, are in the driving seat for Shaw and he will likely stay at Southampton until the summer.

Tottenham also like Coentrao but have made enquiries over United's left-back Alexander Buttner who Moyes is willing to let go on loan with a view to a permanent deal.

Patrice Evra could yet sign a new contract at Old Trafford but remains in the sights of Monaco and Paris St Germain.

Prank: Talk of a £30m offer from Man United for Atletico's Koke (right) has been dismissed as a prank

Meanwhile, reports of a £30million United bid for Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke have been dismissed as a prank.

Stories suggested a deal had been agreed between the two clubs on December 28, the Dia de los Santos Inocentes which is Spain's version of April Fool's Day.

Arsenal are keen on German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen but will have to move quickly if they want to sign him.

The 21-year-old is close to agreeing terms with Barcelona to replace Victor Valdes, while Juventus have also approached his advisors as they consider a successor for Gianluigi Buffon. Ter Stegen has been impressive at Borussia Monchengladbach where he is under contract until 2015.

Arsenal expect to lose Lukasz Fabianski next month with Schalke favourites, Wojciech Szczesny has been in good form but Arsenal are planning ahead and they recognise the potential for a lot of new recruits from the Bundesliga.

Serge Gnabry, who Arsenal brought in from Stuttgart, may be allowed out on loan over the next few weeks depending on injuries. Wigan's German manager Uwe Rosler is among those keen to take the 18-year-old winger.

The future of Manchester City striker John Guidetti could become clearer later today with Stoke City and West Ham United keen.

The 21-year-old is in demand after battling back to fitness following injury and a debilitating virus. He scored 20 goals in 23 games while with Feyenoord in 2011-12 and a queue of clubs, including Malaga, Real Betis and Lazio are among clubs those keen to take him on loan.

Out of the picture: Man City's John Guidetti (second right) is a January loan target for Stoke and West Ham

However, City and his representatives want him to realise his potential in England and are talking to Stoke City and West Ham about a deal until the end of the season.

Both clubs are keen to explore options in the loan market and Guidetti could prove great value if he recaptures the form he showed in Holland.

City are reluctant to let other players leave in January with Jack Rodwell, Javi Garcia and Joleon Lescott all subject to interest at home and abroad. Striker Edin Dzeko is wanted by both Milan clubs and Valencia among many others and if anyone bids £25million then City may yet contemplate a deal but a summer exit is more likely.

Goal threat: West Ham are considering moves for Roma pair Marco Borriello and Nicolas Burdisso

West Ham, meanwhile, have several other 
striker targets. They were due to hold a meeting with Roma's sporting 
director Walter Sabatini at the weekend who is looking to offload Marco 
Borriello and Nicolas Burdisso but the meeting was put off with Fulham 
and Tottenham reputedly speaking to Sabatini instead.

Juventus director Beppe Moratta is also in London as they look to find buyers for Mirko Vucinic and Fabio Quagliarella. Juve are also keen to sign a winger. A deal for United's Luis Nani looks unlikely but they have asked about Chelsea's Kevin de Bruyne and Real Madrid's Angel di Maria also.

Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien could leave Stamford Bridge in the January transfer window.

Essien's agent Fabian Piveteau, who represents the former Ghana international, told French radio that a number of 'major European clubs' have been notified of the 31-year-old’s availability with his freedom to play in the Champions League an added attraction.

'Essien could leave Chelsea this winter,' Piveteau told RMC. 'Several major European clubs playing in the Champions League were informed and the situation should settle down within the next 10 days.

Lack of opportunities: Chelsea's Michael Essien could be on his way out of Stamford Bridge in January

'You should know that Michael was not on the list of players who can play in the Champions League with Chelsea, so he is free to play in the competition with another club.'

Essien, although a favourite of Jose Mourinho, has struggled to make an impression on Chelsea's first team this season.

Chelsea, meanwhile, are continuing to gather information on Radamel Falcao at Monaco. Mourinho has made no secret of wanting a striker, with Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa also in his thinking.

Coincidentally, Monaco have also expressed an interest in Costa who Atletico insist is not for sale until the summer despite the player carrying a £32million buyout clause.

PSV Eindhoven have confirmed they tried to sign Chelsea's Thorgan Hazard on loan. Hazard is on loan at Zulte-Waregem but the younger brother of Eden could join Anderlecht when the transfer window reopens.

Which former young Premier League player has been given an allowance by his agent in a bid to stop his frivolous spending? The final straw came when the player in question bought himself a brand new car for £26,000, even though he doesn't drive.

The father of Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has poured cold water on speculation linking the striker to a move to Barcelona.

There has been much clamour in their native Argentina for Aguero to link up with Lionel Messi at Barcelona.

City would also move for Messi if they felt there was a chance of him leaving Spain. However, the two friends will come face to face in the Champions League next year.

Leonel del Castillo, Aguero’s father, said: 'I would like to see Sergio and Messi playing together, but there is nothing at all.

'Sergio and Leo always speak and more after the Champions League draw. They're good friends, like laughing and they're already joking between them ahead the City v Barça clash.

Going nowhere: Sergio Aguero's dad has poured cold water over rumours his son is off to Barcelona

'We will see two great games. I don't know if I will visit Messi's home, but I will go to hotel for sure to say hello to him. I think it will be a 2-0 in England and at least a 0-1 in Barcelona. I love Messi so much, but I want my son's team to win.'

Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke has derided talk that Ilkay Gundogan is close to a move to Real Madrid.

The Germany international has 18 months left on his contract and is admired by Manchester United and Arsenal.

Although the player's father recently claimed that Carlo Ancelotti's side are to make a move for his signature, Watzke said: 'If we believed everything in the Spanish media about players supposedly leaving us, we would have to worry about getting a team together. We do not know from Ilkay or his father [who is also his agent] that he wants to leave.'

FC Groningen want to open talks with Liverpool about a deal to sign Krisztian Adorjan on a permanent basis.

Adorjan has been on loan at Groningen and the Dutch club had to let Liverpool know before April if they wanted to buy the 20-year-old. Adorjan has impressed in the Eredivisie and Groningen are hoping to tie up a deal in the region of £200,000.

Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis and chairman Steve Parish were among spectators at Charlton Athletic versus Sheffield Wednesday yesterday.

Pulis has a budget of around £15million to spend and ideally wants a goalkeeper, centre-back, midfielder and two strikers. Palace have enquired about Ali Al Habsi's progress from injury while the likes of Stoke's Peter Crouch and Matthew Etherington remain on their list of targets. Everton's Nikica Jelavic and Blackburn's Scott Dann are also players Pulis likes

Sunderland's on loan striker Connor Wickham scored for Wednesday at Charlton and is available but did little else to impress. Charlton's Dale Stephens and Jordan Cousins may have caught Pulis's eye though.

Wanted man: Huddersfield are the latest team to show an interest in Bradford forward Nakhi Wells

Huddersfield Town are the latest club to show interest in Nahki Wells of Bradford City. The League One club want to sell the striker for £3million as he approaches the last 18 months of his contract and Huddersfield are interested should Celtic or others firm up interest in James Vaughan with a sizeable bid.
