The name’s Bennett – Nick Bennett. And when it comes to collecting James Bond memorabilia, it seems, The World is Not Enough.

The British film buff has just been recognised by Guinness World Records for having the largest known 007 collection on the planet – and he has no intention of stopping.

At the last count he boasted a remarkable 12,463 Bond-related items, ranging from the tacky (a plastic volcano play-set based on a scene from You Only Live Twice); to the mildly voyeuristic (a poster of Halle Berry in her Die Another Day bikini).

Licence to fill... a house! Nick Bennett with his world record collection of 12,463 pieces of Bond movie memorabilia. The 47-year-old is just one of the latest clutch of eccentrics to enter Guinness' book of records

Big shoes to fill:  Marawa Ibrahim set the record for a 100-metre spring in high-heeled skates (26.1 seconds)

Huge: Turkish farmer Sultan Kösen is the tallest man alive at 8ft 3in (left) while JJ Bittner has a 3.4in mouth

There was even the somewhat bizarre wall-mountable front third of an Aston Martin DB5 bearing the spy’s 1963 registration plate.

All of which begs one major question: why? ‘I started collecting James Bond memorabilia in the run-up to GoldenEye in 1995,’ Mr Bennett explains on his website.

‘I had bought a few bits over the years but the new Bond [Pierce Brosnan] really kicked off an interest. I don’t specialise in any area – I just buy items I like.’

Mr Bennett, 47, stores them in a shrine-like area of his home in Leigh, near Wigan.

Of his inclusion in the Guinness World Record rankings he said: ‘It’s a dream come true.

Cosy: Londoner Yannick Read, 43, built the world's smallest caravan measuring 5ft high and just 2ft 8in wide

Supermarket sweep: Matt McKeown notched up 70.4mph on a motorised shopping trolley in East Yorkshire

Unsettling: 24-year-old Nick Stoeberl from California has the longest tongue at 3.97in from its tip to the middle of the closed top lip. The 60th anniversary edition of the book, the home of eccentrics, is out tomorrow

'As a child I read the book from cover to cover and I cannot believe that I will actually be in this year’s book as an official record holder – pinch me.’

The landmark 60th edition has been produced after processing more than 50,000 claims over the past 12 months.

The largest collection of Doctor Who memorabilia belongs to Ian O’Brien, 42, from Manchester, with 1,573 items.

Among others confirmed for the coveted record-holder accolade (albeit in categories for which there might not have been much competition) are a Californian who uses only her feet to shoot arrows 20ft into a 5in target while balancing on her hands.

The fastest man on a motorised shopping trolley is Matt McKeown in Yorkshire, at 70.4mph.

Big swing: 'Trick Golf' artist    Karsten Maas, from Denmark, enters the book this year for creating the world's longest usable golf club at 14ft 5in. He had to prove its worth - it was used to drive a ball a distance of 542ft

Odd category: Akiko Obata entered the  book for having the largest collection of prepared food related items

Feat: Simon Chalk held the record for rowing the most oceans (left). Right: In a past record, He Pingping from China was the shortest living man at 2ft 5.37in, while Russian Svetlana Pankratova had the world's longest legs

Favourites: Guinness World Records have relived several records from past years to mark the book's 60th anniversary. In this 2013 image, Antanas Kontrimas celebrated celebrating the heaviest weight with a beard

There is the smallest caravan (Londoner Yannick Read, 7ft 10in long), a brunette who completed the fastest 100m in high-heel roller skates (Australian Marawa Ibrahim, 26.1 seconds) and a Yank with the biggest gob.

JJ Bittner officially has the ‘widest gape’ at 3.4in – ‘measured from the incisal edge of his maxillary central incisors to the incisal edge of his mandibular central incisors’, if you really must know.

Or, as Mr Bennett might view it – The Man with the Golden Gum.
