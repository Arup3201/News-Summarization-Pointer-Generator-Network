What's Mario Balotelli up to now? Liverpool’s £16million striker was sporting an odd new look at training.

Whether the 24-year-old carried on training like this was unclear but it had echoes of when he struggled to put on a bib during his time with Manchester City.

Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre revealed yesterday the club sold huge numbers of Balotelli shirts on the day the Italian moved to Anfield from AC Milan last month.

Ayre said: ‘Having the right people allows the club to maximise signings like Balotelli,

leading to £50,000 worth of shirt sales.’ 

Liverpool face Aston Villa this weekend, who, after an impressive start to the season, currently sit a point ahead of Brendan Rodgers' side in the table.

England forward Daniel Sturridge will be hopeful of returning for the clash after a thigh injury kept him out of England's 2-0 win over Switzerland.
