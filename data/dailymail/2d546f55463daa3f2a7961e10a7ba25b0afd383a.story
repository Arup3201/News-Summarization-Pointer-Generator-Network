After Natalie Morris broke her back in a horrific fall at home, she was warned she might never walk again.

A vertebra in the 26-year-old’s spine cracked and burst open tearing ligaments and tendons which could have left her paralysed.

Doctors feared the worst, describing the break as ‘toe curling’, but remarkably, Ms Morris has been left with no lasting injuries.

Natalie Morris, 26, tripped and fell down a flight of stairs while trying to get to the bathroom in the night

She said: ‘I can’t believe how lucky I am. When I first went to A&E they thought I’d just banged myself up a bit, but as soon as my scans came back all hell broke loose.

‘Everyone presumed the worst and they told me that in a worst case scenario, I could be paralysed. I was terrified - I thought I’d never walk again.

‘They did some tests and luckily I had some feeling in my lower legs so it was a good sign, but I never thought I’d have recovered so quickly.

‘A doctor who saw me had been treating someone who’d had the same type of fall as me - but he’d been referred to another hospital because he’s never going to walk again.

Ms Morris, from Rotherham, had to undergo a seven hour operation in which a cage was built around her spine to stabilise the fragile break of her T-12 vertebra.

She also had a bone graft taken from her pelvis.

She was initially told that it would take up to six months for her to recover but she amazed doctors by walking again within ten days.

She told The Star, her local newspaper in Sheffield: ‘My surgeon told me I was a hair’s breadth away from being paralysed – the break was crazy.

In the fall Ms Morris shattered a vertebra in her lower back and doctors said she was a 'hair's breadth' from being paralysed

‘He said it made his toes curl and he didn’t know how on earth I was walking. I am very lucky.

‘The T-12 vertebra is where you do all your bending and moving for things like putting your shoes on. The way I’d fallen it had basically burst and all the ligaments around it had been damaged.’

Ms Morris, who works in finance, suffered the injury falling down the steep stairs in her home during the night.

She said: ‘I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet but I didn’t turn on the light.

Following her operation, Ms Morris was initially told it would take six months for her to recover

‘I missed my footing on the way to the bathroom and the next thing I knew I was in a pile at the bottom of the stairs.

‘I didn’t really know what had happened but I could feel a searing pain right in the middle of my back.

‘Thanks to the adrenaline I was able to crawl over to my sofa where I rang NHS Direct. I explained what had happened and they told me to call an ambulance immediately.

‘On the way to the hospital there were 101 things going through my mind. I was so upset.’

At Doncaster Royal Infirmary, medics initially planned to send her home with painkillers, but a last minute X-ray revealed the true extent of her injuries.

‘I was in a bed behind a curtain waiting to go home when the doctor came in and told me he’d got some bad news - I’d fractured my spine.

‘I started to panic and went to get up but I was told that I needed to find a comfortable position and stay there.

‘It was important that I didn’t move at all because the break was so unstable It was very scary.’

After Ms Morris’s diagnosis an initial assessment by surgeons suggested that she may recover, but her future was still uncertain.

‘They gave me three options,’ she said.

‘I was told that I could do nothing, have a full body brace, or have surgery. I knew surgery was the best option so I was transferred to Bassetlaw Hospital.

‘The journey there was agony, but the worst part was that my operation wasn’t for three days, and for that whole time I had to lie flat barely moving a muscle and in incredible pain. I just felt so helpless.’

She underwent a seven-hour operation to stabilise her spine and was walking again ten days later

Luckily Ms Morris’s seven-hour operation was a success. ‘I woke up and straight away I knew things were better. I was still in pain, but I knew the pain was as a result of the surgery, not the fall.

‘Then the day after the operation the physio came to try and get me on my feet.

Ms Morris's surgeon said she was lucky not to have damaged her spinal cord

‘It was excruciating - it felt like every bone in my body was popping out - but I was determined to do it.

‘I had the surgery on a Wednesday, by the Saturday I was walking around and four days later I’d been discharged.

‘I don’t think anyone could quite believe it,’ she said.

She added: ‘When I look back at what happened now, it was all a bit of a whirlwind.

‘I knew that no one else was going to get me walking again apart from me, so I just had to do it.

Ms Morris’s surgeon at Bassetlaw Hospital in Worksop, Mr Ranjit Pande, said: ‘Natalie had an extremely unstable injury to her back following an accident.

‘Luckily, there was no injury to her spinal cord so we could stabilise her spine effectively.

‘I am very pleased with the outcome.

‘Natalie was very brave and positive throughout, and all credit goes to her.’

Ms Morris explained to The Star that she can now look after herself again and that her recovery is thanks to the surgery that Mr Pande carried out.

She said: ‘He held my life in his hands and he saved it. I will always have a lasting memory and two scars to remind me, but I have my life and my legs.’
