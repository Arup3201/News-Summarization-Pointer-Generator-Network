A set of 200-year-old tunnels used to hold French prisoners in the Napoleonic wars are going on sale - for the bargain basement price of £19,000.

The three interlocking subterranean chambers were carved deep beneath naval fortifications in Plymouth, Devon, in the early 19th century.

They started off life as a moat, but were drained during the Napoleonic wars so they could be filled with captured French soldiers and sailors.

Piece of history: Part of a labyrinth of tunnels that housed French prisoners during the Napoleonic Wars which have gone on sale for £19,000

Up for sale: The passages have now been entered for online auction as a '0 bedroom, investment property' by Bradley Estate Agents

The three underground chambers were later bricked over and used as air raid shelters throughout Word War II.

The
dingy 60ft tunnels were purchased from the Ministry of Defence in the 
1950s by the Tapper family, who used them to store fishing equipment.

the passages have now been entered for online auction as a '0 bedroom, 
investment property' by Bradley Estate Agents, with a starting price of 
£19,000.

Co-owner Kevin 
Tapper, 54, said the origins of the chambers come from the days when 
Devonport was a fortified town with its own moat and drawbridge.

He said: 'We’ve been told the French Prisoners of War were kept there, away from the Plymouth people. They didn’t want people in Plymouth to see the horrors of Naval battle.'

'We weren’t doing anything with them and because of their location they need a lot of attention so we’ve decided to move on.'

Steve Allen, from Bradley Estate Agents, said any buyer would likely use the tunnels for storage or 'personal recreation' such as a workshop because they are in a restricted area.

He told MailOnline: 'There is no vehicular access, it is under a road and you have to go down a lot of steps.

'We have had some people inquire about change of use for a commercial venture, which may be possible.

'But I think it is unlikely that they would get permission for residential use.'
