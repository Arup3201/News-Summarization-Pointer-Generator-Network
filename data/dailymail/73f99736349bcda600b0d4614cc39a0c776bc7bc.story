A woman who went on a day-and-a-half drug binge while a toddler lay dead in the closet of her house was sentenced Thursday to 22 years in prison.

Laurie Cournoyer, 29, and her husband, Taylor, used methamphetamine, sleeping pills, and marijuana during the marathon drug binge when they were supposed to be caring for several children, including the girl who died.

They didn’t call 911 until 14 hours later, prosecutors alleged.

Moments after her sentencing, the caretaker gave her mother a tearful hug

The Cournoyers, who live about 100 miles outside of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, were looking after RieLee Lovell while her parents were going through a difficult marital patch. 

RieLee Lovell, 2, was strangled to death by her 11-year-old cousin last summer while Cournoyer and her husband were on a day-and-a-half drug binge

Cournoyer  was sentenced Thursday to 10 years in prison for possession of methamphetamine, five years for keeping a place for meth and 10 years, including eight suspended, for having drugs in jail. 

She was also sentenced to five years for failing to report the death of a child, part of a new South Dakota law that makes it a felony if a caretaker knowingly fails to report the death of a child within six hours.

The law was modeled after ‘Caylee’s Law,’ which was passed in Florida after the high-profile death of two-year-old Caylee Anthony, who was only reported missing 31 days after she vanished in Orlando in 2008.

During her sentencing Thursday, Cournoyer told the judge: ‘It hurts my heart to know that I failed them, not only as a mother, but as a protector.’

She added: 'I have had time to see the mistakes I have made, and what it comes down to is the fact that I chose to put that needle in my vein. Now, for the rest of my life, I have to live with that choice.'

Authorities only heard about the death of two-year-old RieLee Lovell after another child under the couple’s care invited neighbors over to look at the dead body lying in the closet of their Warner, South Dakota home at a Yankton Sioux tribal housing project.

RieLee was apparently under Cournoyer’s care as her parents were going through marital difficulties. Her cousin, an 11-year-old boy who authorities said was troubled, strangled the girl to death on July 3, 2012. 

She said that she wanted to go back in time and change things, but knew that was impossible. ‘I can, however, take responsibility for my part, for creating an environment where something bad happened and I didn’t know about it because I was high.’

Cournoyer added that she hopes her case brings awareness to the substance abuse problem that is running rampant in the small town, according to the Daily Republic.

‘Meth is hurting our people,’ she said. ‘Our families, our community. But most importantly, our children.’

Taylor Cournoyer, pictured on July 17, 2012 was sentenced last November for his part in the toddler's death

Assistant Attorney General Bill Golden said that her behavior was ‘inappropriate and cannot be tolerated,’ according to KDLT.

He continued: ‘The most precious thing we have is our children and when people resort to drugs and alcohol to avoid that responsibility, that’s what the harm is.'

Her husband, Taylor Cournoyer pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine and keeping a place for use or sale of drugs as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors.

He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in November.

An 11-year-old boy also has been charged in the case.

Details of his alleged involvement have not been released because he is a juvenile, but their defense lawyer, Scott Swier, said the ‘minor child on minor child’ assault that killed RieLee was a ‘perfect storm,’ according to the Argus Leader.
