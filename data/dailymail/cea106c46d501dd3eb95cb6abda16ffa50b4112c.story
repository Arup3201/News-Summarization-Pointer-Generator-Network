Nigella Lawson’s chances of conquering the lucrative U.S. market are now in danger of collapsing like a bad soufflé, experts said yesterday.

Drugs claims surrounding the TV cook swept quickly across the Atlantic, where she had become a rising star as a judge on hit cookery competition The Taste.

TV network ABC said a second series featuring Miss Lawson would be screened as planned in January, but sources said bosses were ‘debating’ whether to invite her back for a third.

‘We will wait to see the fallout from the court case and if there are further allegations of drug use,’ said the source.

‘If
these allegations are proven and substantiated, then her career on 
American TV is over.’ The source added that the channel had ‘zero 
tolerance’ towards drugs and claimed bad publicity would mean no 
production company ‘will want to touch her’.

ABC’s
flagship show Good Morning America featured a two-minute news report on
the trial of the Grillo sisters yesterday – but within hours the 
network also broadcast a promotional clip for The Taste.

The ABC source said Miss Lawson would have been paid more than £200,000 per episode.

The
show has also been commissioned by Channel 4, which yesterday said 
filming for the ten-episode series had finished and will be screened in 
Britain early next year.

It was alleged yesterday that Nigella abused cocaine, cannabis and prescription drugs.

The claims emerged from court as her two former PAs, Italian sisters Francesca Grillo, 41, and Elisabetta 
Grillo, 35, prepared to stand trial accused of spending £300,000 on Charles Saatchi's company credit cards.

The British cook is a panel judge alongside Ludo Lefebvre, Marcus Samuelsson and Anthony Bourdain.

A statement from ABC said: 'We have 
already wrapped production on ‘The Taste’ and it will air as planned 
beginning January 2nd.'

However,
while the second series will go ahead, ABC are still 'debating' whether
or not to invite Nigella back to judge a third season of the show, 
sources told the New York Daily News.

Meanwhile,
Channel 4 confirmed to MailOnline that they will be going ahead with their plans to 
air a 10-part UK version of The Taste in early 2014 regardless of the 
allegations of drug use.

Dominic
Bird, Channel 4's head of formats, said in July when it was confirmed 
the channel had picked up the series: 'I'm thrilled that Nigella is 
returning to Channel 4 alongside Anthony and Ludo.

'The
Taste promises to be a hugely exciting and compelling competition with 
stellar talent and exceptional cooking at its heart.'

A spokesman for Nigella Lawson referred questions about The Taste to ABC in the U.S.
