Los Angeles prosecutors have declined to file any charges against Bill Cosby after a woman recently reported the comedian molested her around 1974.

The rejection of a child sexual abuse charge by prosecutors on Tuesday comes roughly 10 days after the woman, Judy Huth, met with police detectives.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office rejected filing a misdemeanor charge of annoying or molesting a child under the age of 18 because the statute of limitations had passed.

Huth has claimed Cosby plied her with beer while the two played billiards, then led her to a bedroom inside the mansion and forced her to perform a sex act on him.

A lawsuit claimed: 'psychological injuries and illnesses were caused by the sexual abuse.' 

Cosby's attorney said that Huth attempted to extort $250,000 from the comedian before she sued.

The accusations prompted a horrified Hugh Hefner to issue a statement over the incident.

Hefner, who counts Cosby as a close friend, said: 'the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening.'

The Playboy mogul, who lives at the Beverly Hills mansion, added: 'I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved.' 

Other Playboy housemates have since claimed that Cosby's abuse was widespread. One woman, 24-year-old Chloe Goins, claims she was attacked in 2008 - and intends to go to police about it.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Goins said Cosby drugged her then stripped her naked. She allegedly woke up to find him sucking her toes and pleasuring himself.

She said: 'I was butt naked lying on my back on a bed and didn't have any idea where I was... I came to and remember seeing this big man crouched over me.

'It was Bill Cosby and he was at my feet, kind of licking and kissing them and I think he bit my toe as that's what woke me up... He jumped up, pulled his pants back up quickly and left.

Speaking out: Chloe Goins is the latest woman to speak of being drugged and attacked by Cosby. However her case is so recent that it is not covered by any statutes of limitation, which affects other allegations

'He had seen that I was alert and bolted out of there, I was left in the room by myself.' 

'I remember waking up and feeling moist all over, like he had been licking all over me... I felt embarrassed, it was a gross, icky feeling, I felt very violated and humiliated.

'I was scared, I was just 18 and he was an old man, I was not very sexually experienced and I didn't really know what had happened, it was violating.'

Recently another housemate, P J Masten, who worked for Playboy in LA and Chicago, said she and 12 other Playboy workers were also raped, but have been too scared to come forward.

Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, has called allegations against the trailblazing African-American comedian 'discredited' and 'defamatory'.

Singer and Cosby's publicist did not immediately response to requests seeking comment on Tuesday about the prosecutor's decision.

Cosby's wife and one of his four daughters have defended him in public statements over the past two days.

Evin Cosby, 38, said in a statement that Cosby 'is the father you thought you knew,' echoing the statement of her mother, Camille Cosby, who publicly defended her husband for the first time on Monday.

The statements by Camille and Evin Cosby have drawn on the comedian's affable TV persona as the wholesome father Dr. Cliff Huxtable on the top-rated series 'The Cosby Show.'

The comedian, who has largely remained silent, has had two television projects shelved and several standup performances canceled since the numerous allegations started last month.

In 2006, Cosby settled a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct. Another accuser, Tamara Green, has sued Cosby for defamation.

Cosby's most high-profile accusers include models Janice Dickinson and Beverly Johnson. Dickinson alleges that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1982 while Johnson alleges Cosby drugged her in the mid-1980s.
