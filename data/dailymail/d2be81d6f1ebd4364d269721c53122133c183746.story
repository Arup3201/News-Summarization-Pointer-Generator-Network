It's the kind of disastrous throw we all remember cringingly from school - but then, we're not all $500,000-a-year Major League Baseball stars.

A New York Yankees newcomer has been mocked after his gentle underarm toss to first base went wildly wrong and sailed over his teammate's head.

Shane Greene was in New York's Yankee stadium last night when he had an easy chance to get out Texas Rangers batter Jim Adduci.

Simple toss: New York Yankees newcomer Shane Greene has been mocked after a gentle underarm toss to first base went wildly wrong last night. Pictured is Greene (left) preparing to throw the ball

Disastrous: As Greene (left) approaches infielder Kelly Johnson, the ball flies out of his hand too fast

Ball in hand, the 25-year-old pitcher jogged towards first base before releasing the ball over a distance of little more than a dozen feet.

But instead of reaching the waiting arms of infielder Kelly Johnson, it soared away over his head to the surprise of everyone on the field.

Live coverage showed Adduci slowing down at first base before turning around confused, seeing the ball and promptly racing away to second base.

Luckily for Greene his error - which pundits said was one of three he made on the night - did not result in a run for the Rangers.

But the Texas team still won 4-2 leading 
to widespread mockery of Greene, who had been making his first career 
start at the Yankee stadium.

Oops! Within seconds it was clear to TV viewers - and Greene's teammate - that things had gone wildly wrong

Baseball fans pointed out it was the 
first time a Yankees pitcher had made three errors in one game since 
1988, when Tommy John made three in just one play.

Others compared Greene's performance to that of a 5ft 105-year-old widow who made a decisive first pitch the previous night - while leaning on a walking frame.

Feisty Agnes McKee, the oldest resident at her retirement home in San Diego, California, stunned onlookers at a Padres game by winding her arm several times before making a strong underhand toss.

Twitter users reacted instantly to Greene's foul-up last night, with many questioning whether it was the worst underarm throw ever.

Rookie pitcher Greene joined the Yankees' 40-man roster in November, and made his first start earlier this month after signing a contract worth a reputed $500,000 a year.
