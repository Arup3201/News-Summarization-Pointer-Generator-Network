British Airways boss Willie Walsh has predicted that the much-vaunted third runway for Heathrow will never be built because dithering politicians lack the courage to make tough decisions.

As a result, Heathrow will be overtaken permanently next year by Dubai as the world’s busiest airport, he said.

Mr Walsh warned the situation could force airlines including BA, which has its own terminal at the airport, to base themselves elsewhere – resulting in British job losses and stunted economic growth.

The withering attack came just hours after Government airports tsar Sir Howard Davies launched a 12-week consultation into UK airport expansion.

Three options are on the table: Two rival plans at Heathrow – one for a third runway and another to extend an existing one – and an option for a second runway at Gatwick.

However, Mr Walsh, CEO of BA’s parent company, the International Airlines Group, said that ‘like many other world-class reports’, it would gather dust on a shelf and never be implemented.

‘Politicians won’t be brave enough to grasp the nettle. I don’t think we have the politicians in place who will deal with it,’ he said.

Britain’s political class lacked vision and had ‘given up on world ambition,’ he added.

Sir Howard also warned of the economic damage to the UK if politicians failed to act speedily on his final report due just after the general election in May next year.

He said of the next Government: ‘If they duck that, they will pay. We are reaching then end of the runway.’

But Mr Walsh said: ‘Maybe I am cynical but I remain totally convinced that nothing will actually happen.’

During a Q&A session with veteran BBC broadcaster John Humphrys at the Airport Operators Association annual conference in London, Mr Walsh said he had already planned BA’s future on the basis that neither Heathrow nor Gatwick will expand.

He said: ‘Growth in the UK will be constricted. Heathrow is full. But my business doesn’t just relate to Heathrow. We will continue to grow. Not all of that growth will be at Heathrow.’

He said that because BA was part of IAG, with sister Spanish airline Iberia based in Madrid, they had the flexibility to expand abroad.

Mr Walsh said that the gulf state of Dubai was expanding its airports massively. ‘Next year they will overtake Heathrow as the busiest airport in the world,’ he said.

Dubai International currently has two runways. In the first three months of this year it overtook Heathrow as the busiest airport in the world, before falling back because of work on its runways.

Mr Walsh added: ‘Once the work has been completed they are expected to overtake us by quarterly passenger traffic early next year. That will become permanent.’

And Dubai said in September that it planned to invest £20 billion in a mega-hub airport in the desert to accommodate 240 million passengers a year, dwarfing the 72 million passengers that Heathrow serves.

Mr Walsh said Dubai had support from politicians and business leaders with ‘vision and real aspiration’. 

He pointed out that the terms of Sir Howard’s Airport Commission consultation was to ensure that the UK remained only as the major hub ‘in Europe’.

Mr Walsh said of UK politicians: ‘They have given up on world ambition. We’ve gone from world ambition to European ambition. What next? It’s disappointing.’

A new Thames Estuary airport favoured by Boris Johnson has already been ruled out, although the London Mayor still insists it is the best option.

AIRPORT security is becoming so extreme that passengers could be forced to walk through scanners ‘in hospital gowns’, Willie Walsh said.

He claimed many checks, including rules on liquids, were unnecessary and simply caused long queues.

Mr Walsh said: ‘[Security is] still the most frustrating part of the customer journey that I experience. It’s also the area that frustrates our customers most.

‘You are still taking off your shoes, which I’m sure is not necessary. We’re taking everything out of our bag when there’s technology which can deal with that.’

He added: ‘In ten years’ time you will have to go through security in a hospital gown. You won’t be allowed to wear clothes.’ He said that if security chiefs started with a blank piece of paper, they would dispense with many of the checks, and complained of confusing inconsistencies in the rules.

He told the Airport Operators Association annual conference in London: ‘Sometimes you have to take your iPad out, other times you can leave it in. Some tell you to take your shoes off, others to keep them on. Belt on? Belt off.

‘Why is it I can have my iPad in my bag this time, but not the next time? These are things which don’t make sense.’

When challenged that airport bosses did not believe it was an issue, Mr Walsh retorted: ‘That’s not what my customers tell me.’
