Disgraced: Grahame Maxwell, former Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police, is to get the payout despite admitting 'gross misconduct'

A disgraced former chief constable who admitted gross misconduct for helping a relative get a job has walked away from the force with a £250,000 golden goodbye, it emerged yesterday.

Grahame Maxwell, 51, narrowly escaped the sack over the claims of nepotism and was given a final written warning at a secret disciplinary hearing last May.

But after the police authority refused to extend his £133,000-a-year contract a controversial clause legally entitling Mr Maxwell to £247,636 in compensation was activated.

The clause enables Mr Maxwell to receive 85 per cent of the difference between the pension lump sum he is now eligible for after serving 28-and-a-half years and the amount he would have received had he continued for another 18 months.

It is believed to be the first time the compensation clause has ever been activated following a decision not to renew a chief constable's contract.

Today, the payment to the former North Yorkshire police chief was branded 'shocking' and 'ridiculous'.

Skipton and Ripon Tory MP Julian Smith urged the government to overhaul the rules which entitled Mr Maxwell to the large pay-out.

'The taxpayers of North Yorkshire will find this figure shocking,' he said.

'I have already written to the Policing Minister and I am meeting with him to make the case that never again will a chief officer guilty of gross misconduct be able to take these ridiculous sums of money.'

Mr Maxwell admitted making 'errors of judgement' when he helped a family member jump the queue to apply for a job within his own force in February 2010.

He stepped in after a hotline set up to recruit 70 new officers was 'overwhelmed' by 500,000 applicants, many of whom were unable to get through.

Among them was a male member of Mr Maxwell's extended family.

The relative was not entitled to a 'call back', but nonetheless Mr Maxwell rang the family member himself and completed the vetting questionnaire.

Mr Maxwell later admitted his involvement and in a meeting with the force solicitor allegedly described himself as an 'a***hole'.

Despite his apparent admission Mr Maxwell continued to deny helping the relative and only admitted the charge of gross misconduct - a sackable offence - when his disciplinary hearing got underway.

By then more than £300,000 of public money had been spent on the misconduct case.

Mr Maxwell did not respond to calls from this newspaper for a comment.

But the existence of the clause that entitled him to the pay-out is likely to come into sharper focus when the newly-elected police commissioners take over from police authorities at the end of the year.

Under new rules commissioners will be given the power to remove chief constables from office. As a result there could be more pay-outs similar to the one Mr Maxwell received.

Last night, Police Authority Chief Executive Jeremy Holderness said: 'It is important that the public understand that the Authority had absolutely no discretion in this matter whatsoever.

'Mr Maxwell became entitled to receive this payment as a matter of law, following the Authority's decision not to extend his fixed term appointment.'

A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: 'Police authorities signed up to these arrangements several years ago but we are looking at them again in the light of the recent Winsor Review.'

'It recommended that misconduct hearings should have the power to remove all or part of a chief constable's severance payment and we have asked the Police Negotiating Board to consider this.'

Mr Maxwell has been succeeded by temporary chief constable Tim Madgwick.

The police authority said Mr Madgwick's temporary appointment was to allow the Police and Crime Commissioner, due to be elected in November, to make the final decision on a substantive appointment.
