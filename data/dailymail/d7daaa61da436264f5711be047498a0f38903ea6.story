A small Kentucky liberal arts college said Monday a $250 million donation that was among the largest gifts to higher education in U.S. history has been withdrawn.

Centre College announced that the widely reported gift, from the A. Eugene Brockman Charitable Trust, was linked to a 'significant capital market event', and revealed to MailOnline the gift was tied to an expected corporate reorganization that fell through. Broken down across the school's enrollment, the gift worked out to about $208,000 per student. It was to be used to fund scholarships and other learning initiatives.

'This is a deep disappointment, let’s be clear... this is a disappointing day,' Centre College President John Roush told MailOnline.

One of the largest-ever: The $250million, all-stock gift would have ranked in the top 20 ever given to higher education in the US

Though the Brockman Trust has not publicly disclosed the reason for going back on its eye-popping pledge, Richard Trollinger, the school's chief fundraiser, told MailOnline that Reynolds and Reynolds and United Computer Systems, from which the all-stock grant was going to be made, are currently in the midst of a reorganization.

'The company was going through a corporate reorganization and recapitalization… a multi-billion dollar transaction,' said Mr Trollinger. That transaction was to close last Wednesday, which did not happen, Mr Trollinger noted.

'We learned a week ago that it did not look promising for the closing to happen on schedule,' Mr Trollinger said, adding that once finding out Wednesday that the refinancing offer was withdrawn, the writing was on the wall.

'We learned Friday the grant was withdrawn,' said Mr Trollinger.

The money for the grant, according to Mr Trollinger, was to come from the capital injection received while refinancing debt and other obligations. 'Typically in those situations, it allows you to take some money,' Mr Trollinger added.

No discussions took place to perhaps work out a smaller grant. After going public with the planned donation, the Centre College was all dressed up with nowhere to go.

'It was withdrawn completely... there will be no further discussions regarding the grant or the scholarship program,' said Mr Trollinger.

The school decided to go forward with announcing the abrupt cancellation of the Brockman Scholars program because it had planned on beginning recruiting for the first class of beneficiaries to join the school this August, Mr Trollinger noted.

The donation was the college's idea, Mr Roush said, explaining that he approached the trust. Centre College will continue its pursuit of creating the type of scholarship program envisioned by the gift, but is now exploring different avenues to fund such a program he added.

Despite there being no other donors readily available to fill the massive void left by the donation claw-back, 'we certainly have other people who care about the welfare of our students,' Mr Roush added.

'We will continue to pursue the goal 
of such a program designed to prepare students as leaders and 
entrepreneurs,' Mr Roush said. 'A task force of trustees, faculty, staff
and students will be assembled to continue this conversation.'

At $250million, the all-stock donation would have more than doubled the school's current $230million endowment, according to Bloomberg. It was slated
to fund 160 scholarships as part of the Brockman Scholars program, with
40 awarded each year for the next four years, Bloomberg noted.

Reynolds and Reynolds, a Dayton, Ohio-based supplier of car dealer support services, was publicly traded prior to the merger and has been on a recent acquisition spree, according to announcements on the company's site.

When reached by MailOnline for comment, a Reynolds and Reynolds spokesperson said the company is not affiliated with the Brockman Trust and declined further comment. The trust is named for the deceased father of current company president and CEO Robert T. "Bob" Brockman, who once attended Centre College.

The trust has donated to Centre College before, in 2011 with a $19.5million gift that was used to build new student residences, according to the school's website. Named Brockman Commons, the apartment-style dorm houses 124 upper-class student, according to the university.

Eugene Brockman formed the charitable trust in 1981, a few years before his death. His son, Robert Brockman, attended Centre for a couple of years before getting his degree elsewhere and is a former chairman of the school's board of trustees. Bob Brockman, who lives in Houston, left the Kentucky school because he wanted a degree in business administration, which isn't offered as a major at Centre.

Richard Trollinger, Centre's vice president of college relations, said the Brockman Trust has been "a longtime friend and important partner." He said the trust has made a number of generous gifts over the years to help transform the campus and improve its facilities.

'Our collaboration with the Brockman Trust has made us better in many ways and will continue to do so,' he said.

Both Mr Trollinger and Mr Roush were quick to point out the past generosity of Mr Brockman and the trust. Mr Brockman remains on the school's board of trustees, they noted.

The all-stock donation had ranked among 
the 20 biggest gifts ever to a U.S. college or university, according to a
list maintained by the Chronicle of Higher Education. It had been the 
second-largest such gift to a U.S. school since 2011, according to the 
Chronicle of Philanthropy, surpassed only by New York Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg's $350 million donation to Johns Hopkins University announced 
earlier this year.

Despite today's bad news, Mr Roush sounded a positive note for the small school's future.

'Centre College was an outstanding national liberal arts college before the gift was committed, and Centre's future remains exceedingly bright,' Mr Roush said.

The grant would have been all-stock, no cash was involved, and was to have come from leftover equity after a refinancing offer that fell through
