Martin Tankleff, pictured after his release from prison in 2007, has settled his wrongful conviction lawsuit for $3.4million

A man who served 17 years in prison after police tricked him into falsely confessing to murdering his parents has settled a wrongful conviction lawsuit against New York state for nearly $3.4million.

Martin Tankleff, 42, was convicted in the 1988 killings of his parents in their eastern Long Island home.

But he was freed in 2007 after an appeals court found key evidence in his trial was overlooked. Prosecutors ultimately decided against a new trial.

His attorneys argued that his confession was coerced and that a family business associate was the real culprit.

A spokeswoman for the state attorney general confirmed the settlement, saying it resolves the case on behalf of the state.

Tankleff was 17 years old when his parents were bludgeoned and stabbed. He told police he found them on September 7, 1988, in their waterfront home in Belle Terre.

His mother was dead; his father was gravely wounded and died a few weeks later.

The teenager suggested that a partner in his father's bagel business could be the killer.

He said the partner owed Seymour Tankleff hundreds of thousands of dollars. The business partner, Jerry Steuerman, was never charged and has denied involvement in the crimes.

After questioning Tankleff at home and at police headquarters, detectives falsely told him that his father had awoken from a coma and named him as the killer.

At that point, Tankleff wondered aloud whether he might have 'blacked out' and committed the crimes.

Police said they read him his Miranda warning, but Tankleff waived his rights and confessed to attacking his parents.

Original trial: Tankleff was 17 years old when his parents were 
bludgeoned and stabbed to death at their Long Beach home. He was tricked 
into confessing to their murder

Tricked: After questioning Tankleff at home and at
 police headquarters, detectives falsely told him that his father had 
awoken from a coma and named him as the killer

He said he was angry at his parents over a variety of slights, including being made to drive a 'crummy old Lincoln,' police said.

However, Tankleff quickly withdrew the confession, refusing to sign a statement police had prepared.

Tankleff was sentenced to 50 years to life in prison after being convicted in one of the nation's first televised trials.

The case raised questions about police interrogation tactics and drew the support of the Innocence Project, an organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted people.

A federal lawsuit against Suffolk County and a detective who has admitted he coerced a confession from Tankleff is pending.
