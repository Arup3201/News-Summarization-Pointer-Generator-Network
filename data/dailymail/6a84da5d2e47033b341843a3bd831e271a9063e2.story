Doctors fear a large outbreak of mumps may follow the latest measles epidemic - because of a generation who missed out on MMR jabs.

Health chiefs have warned students in South Wales to get vaccinated against the highly contagious mumps virus.

Today Cardiff University put out an official warning to all students.

The email to students read: 'Public Health Wales has had increasing 
numbers of notifications of mumps in the University population.

Cardiff University has sent an email to students asking them visit their GP if they have not had their MMR jab because the number of mumps cases ha started to rise

'It is therefore advisable if you are not vaccinated to contact your GP as soon as possible to arrange vaccination.

'As you may be aware there is a large outbreak of measles predominantly, but not exclusively, in the Swansea area.

'If you have not had two doses of MMR vaccine you are advised to contact your GP and make an appointment.'

Medical advisors say mumps can lead to infertility and even death in the most severe cases.

And they fear a repeat of the measles outbreak which has already hit 1,039 people in the South Wales area - with 85 patients hospitalised.

Dangerous: The mumps virus can cause infertility and even death

Mumps is a contagious viral infection that used to be common in children.

It causes painful swellings at the side of the face and under the ears.

Other symptoms include headache, joint pain and a high temperature.

It is spread by infected droplets of saliva.

There is currently no treatment but symptoms usually pass within two weeks.

Complications are rare but mumps can lead to deadly viral meningitis, as well as swollen testicles and ovaries which cause infertility

The MMR vaccine now gives children 95 per cent protection against mumps.

Before it was introduced in 1988, mumps was responsible for 1,200 hospital admissions every year.

A spokeswoman for Public Health Wales said: 'We want to encourage everyone who is eligible for the vaccine, including students, to come forward.

'Two doses of MMR give you 99 per cent protection against measles, mumps and rubella.'

'These are all highly contagious and could spread quickly in closed communities such as schools and universities.

'Students should get the vaccine as a matter of urgency and those in doubt should receive the MMR again as a precaution.'

The measles epidemic, which started in October, has been blamed on a scare about MMR vaccine which led many parents to decide not to immunise their children.

Many of those children are now at university and could be coming into contact with people infected with the illness.

Those who havenâ€™t had the vaccine can easily contract mumps which can lead to meningitis, encephalitis, pancreatitis, deafness and painful swelling of the testicles
