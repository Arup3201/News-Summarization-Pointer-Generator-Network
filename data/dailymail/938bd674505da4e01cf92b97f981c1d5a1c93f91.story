A man charged with murder for firing a cannon-like device that killed his girlfriend said in a jailhouse interview Friday that he wants a time machine to go back and keep from firing it, and he wishes he'd been the one killed instead.

'I'm just so sorry, if I could just go back in time I would've never done it,' Richard Dale Fox told NBC San Diego through tears.

'I just wish that the damn thing had hit me instead of her, you know?'

Fox, 39, was drinking with friends in the San Diego County town of Potrero on Tuesday when he set off the device, sending shrapnel into his trailer that killed 38-year-old Jeanette Ogara, who was his girlfriend and the mother of his 4-year-old daughter, prosecutors said.

Richard Fox, 39, was also charged with exploding a destructive device and child endangerment.

Miss Ogara was found dead from shrapnel wounds when police arrived at the trailer in the small mountain community of Potrero on the Mexican border.

Exotic: Jeanette Ogara and Richard Fox were said to be well known in their community because of Ogara's striking beauty and Fox's striking appearance

The couple and their 4-year-old daughter Vanessa lived together in their trailer home and were said to be well known in the community, largely because of Fox's 'striking appearance' and 
Ogara's 'exotic beauty'.

Prosecutors said the pair had been 
drinking with friends on Tuesday when Fox went outside and lit the fuse 
to a 21-inch-long, 2-inch-thick steel pipe that he had stuck into the 
ground outside.

Charged: Richard Fox was charged with his girlfriend's murder. If convicted he faces life in prison without parole

In a recording of the 911 call made by Fox he can be heard sobbing down the phone to the emergency services.

'We've been drinking and everything, you know, I mean we had a few beers... (inaudible)... I went out there and I lit this stupid (expletive) homemade canon with this firework in there and it (expletive) went off and blew a hole through the side of the house and... (inaudible) Oh my god... Oh my god,' Fox says on the tape.

Moments later he phoned his brother Jerry and said: 'I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it should have been me,' according to U-T San Diego.

Two years ago, Fox pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge that he committed battery against his girlfriend in 2006.

Today he pleaded not guilty to all charges and Superior 
Court Judge Charles Ervin set bail at $3.5 million. If convicted, Fox faces life in prison without parole.

John Arnold, a neighbor, told U-T San Diego that Fox worked as a handyman and lived in the home for about six years.

'He liked experimenting with guns, and it looks like this experiment went bad,' he told the newspaper.

He added that Fox 'adores Jeanette and Vanessa. They mean the world to him. I can’t imagine how he feels right now. He probably doesn’t want to live.'

Brother Jerry Fox, of Redding, told the newspaper that Fox 'likes to live on the edge.

'He is one of those people who likes to take things apart and put things back together and likes to see how things work.'
