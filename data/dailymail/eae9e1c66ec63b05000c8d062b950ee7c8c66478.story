It's only natural to want to let your hair down after one of the most hotly-contested title races of all time.

That's exactly what Manchester City players did after finally sealing the trophy after beating West Ham 2-0 at the Etihad.

Stars like Sergio Aguero, Fernandinho, Alvaro Negredo, Samir Nasri and Joe Hart all came down to Manchester Town Hall with their wives and girlfriends for the club's title party.

Vincent Kompany went the extra mile. City's Belgian skipper was still wearing a club scarf as he accompanied his wife Carla - also in sky blue - to the bash.

It wasn't just squad members at the party, as life-long City fan and Oasis legend Liam Gallagher was on hand to toast his side's win with brother Paul.

Manager Manuel Pellegrini also turned out for the celebration, but insisted after the game that he wants another party this time next season.

Speaking after the game the City manager said: 'Big teams cannot be satisfied with just one title.

'It is very important to celebrate 
today and tomorrow, and start on Tuesday working for next season. Then 
we will start thinking where we can improve.

'It was a beautiful, great season and in the future we will try to continue winning.

'I manage a great group of players and a great institution. We were the best team in the Premier League.'
