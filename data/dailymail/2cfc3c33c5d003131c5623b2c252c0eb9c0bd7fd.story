A schoolgirl is unable to receive any hugs from her family or friends because being touched can leave her in agony.

Ella Murphy, 11, suffers from a rare neurological disease that can cause a burning sensation.

The pain can be triggered by stress or brought on by a minor injury such as a bruise, before traveling through the body.

Ella Murphy, 11, suffers from a rare neurological disease that can cause a burning sensation. She is currently suffering from extreme pain in her ankles and has to be lifted in and out of bed, relying on a wheelchair and crutches to move around

The cause of the pain is Complex Regional Pain Disorder (CRPS), a rare syndrome which affects one in 4,000 people.

The pain usually develops after a minor 
injury but the pain experienced is out of all proportion to what a 
person would normally expect.

To stop it from striking other areas, Ella has to ensure that she keeps moving, but at times the condition prevents her from being able to walk.

Little is known about what causes the disorder, but experts hope Ella will grow out of it before she reaches adulthood.

Ella's mother Charlotte said: 'I just want to take her pain away, but even a hug can make it feel worse for her'

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a poorly understood condition in which a person develops a persistent burning pain.

The pain usually develops after a minor injury but the pain experienced is out of all proportion to what a person would normally expect.

The skin of the affected body part can become very sensitive, and even the slightest touch, bump, or change in temperature can provoke a feeling of intense pain.

If left untreated, the pain can spread to other parts of the body.

In some cases of CRPS the pain passes after a few weeks but it can persist for months or even years.

The cause of CRPS is unknown but the condition appears linked to an abnormal brain response to injury.

It appears something causes certain nerves to misfire in some way triggering pain, but scientists are not sure what.

A combination of physical therapy, medication - such as anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers - as well as emotional support to help people cope with the pain, are usually prescribed as treatment.

Ella lives in the village of Langport, near Yeovil, Somerset with her mother Charlotte, 44, and her father Shaun, 45, a website support technician.

Mrs Murphy, who works in a premature baby unit, said: ‘The pain can come on because she has knocked herself or it can develop by itself or through stress.

‘She has had it in a variety of places including her hips, shoulder, knees, and currently it is in her ankle so she is using crutches and a wheelchair to get around.

‘The pain can last from days and weeks to months and the only way to get through it is to make sure she keeps moving, as if she doesn’t it can spread.’

Mrs Murphy explained the condition is especially horrible as she instinctively wants to give Ella a cuddle to make her feel better, but she is unable to hug her when she has pain in her upper body.

‘I just want to take her pain away but even a hug can make it feel worse for her,’ she said.

‘She is currently using crutches and a wheelchair to get around as the pain is in her ankles so luckily I can cuddle her at the moment, but that can change on a regular basis.

'As soon as the pain is in her arm or anywhere like that, we have to be so careful,’ she added.

Ella’s mother explained that her daughter was born with no health problems but developed CRPS when she was aged seven.

The youngster woke up in the middle of the night and was suddenly unable to move her right arm.

The
 condition was initially diagnosed as a fracture but was later revealed 
to be caused by a growth plate and was treated with physiotherapy.

When the treatment failed, Ella was diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and was eventually assessed by an expert in CRPS who realised she had the condition.

There is no cure for the disease but it can be managed by painkillers and physical therapy.

Mrs
 Murphy said: ‘It took about a year for her to be diagnosed and that was
 when we saw a specialist who diagnosed her with CRPS.

‘By this point she could no longer write with her right hand or even dress herself and I knew something was seriously wrong when we were told what it was.

‘It is a neurological condition which means that the nerve endings that transmit signals from the brain become confused and make parts of the body feel a lot of pain.

‘It is hoped that if the condition is diagnosed and treated early that children can grow out of it so we are hoping that in a few years her condition will start to improve.’
