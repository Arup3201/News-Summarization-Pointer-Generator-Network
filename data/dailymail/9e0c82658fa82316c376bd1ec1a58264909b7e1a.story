Trial: Bill Roache, pictured today outside Preston Crown Court, has been cleared of one of the five counts of indecent assault he faced

Coronation Street star Bill Roache was today cleared of one of the counts of indecent assault he was facing in his sex abuse trial.

The judge at Preston Crown Court told jurors they should find the actor not guilty on one of the seven charges after the prosecution declined to offer further evidence.

The allegation was one of two made by a woman who said she was aged 14 when Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in the ITV soap, twice made her perform a sex act on him.

Giving evidence, the complainant said the actor first struck in the gents' toilets at Granada Studios in Manchester in the summer of 1965.

Jurors were then shown a letter and signed photograph that Roache, 81, had sent to her after that alleged incident in which he asked to her write back to him when she returned to school.

The woman claimed later that same year she was picked up by the actor from the studios in his Rolls-Royce and they had a conversation of a sexual nature.

She said she thought that she had also been indecently assaulted in his car but she had 'no actual memory' of the episode.

Mr Justice Holroyde said: 'In relation to that episode the witness was not giving evidence that it did happen, she was giving evidence that she was thinking it did happen and that is not a sufficient evidential basis for the conviction of an offence.'

Family: Roache arriving at court with his children to hear that he would be cleared of one charge

Roache, 81, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, 
remains on trial over two counts of rape and four counts of indecent 
assault involving the five complainants, who were aged 16 and under at 
time of the alleged incidents between 1965 and 1971.

Three women claim Roache abused them at Granada Studios, while the fourth claims she was abused as he drove his luxury car.

Another woman told the court that the actor raped her in his home after inviting her inside on two separate occasions when she was 15.

He denies all the charges.

After closing the prosecution case today, Anne Whyte QC told the jury: 'We do not invite you to convict on any allegation where the witness has no recollection. So we do not proceed against Mr Roache in relation to count 2.'

'Count 2' refers to the allegation that Roache assaulted a 14-year-old girl between June and September 1965.

Letter: Roache sent this signed photo and letter to an alleged victim; he was accused of assaulting her twice, but has now been cleared of one of the charges

Mr Justice Holroyde told the jurors: 'Each charge is a separate allegation which requires your separate consideration and separate verdict.

'The prosecution acknowledge quite rightly that in law the evidence which [the witness] gave cannot be sufficient for a jury to find a guilty verdict.

'The prosecution are no longer pursuing that charge. Mr Roache is entitled to a not guilty verdict on that charge.'

He said it was 'a matter of law' that the jury 'could not and must not' convict on the count concerned.

The trial continues tomorrow morning, when Roache is expected to give evidence from the witness box.
