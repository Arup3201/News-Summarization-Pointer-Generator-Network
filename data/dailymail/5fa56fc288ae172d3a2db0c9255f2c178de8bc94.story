A British people-trafficker hid an Afghan couple and their four-month-old baby in the boot of his car for five hours as he tried to smuggle them through the Channel Tunnel.

Dwight Johnson, 52, who lives in London but was born in Jamaica admitted giving the baby a sedative to silence it as he tried to pass through customs.

Johnson locked the family in his boot in Paris before driving to Coquelles, Calais, where he was stopped by border police and arrested.

A court in Boulogne, northern France, heard  how Johnson had been paid £2,000 to sneak the family across the border and into Britain.

He claimed the migrants had climbed into his car a few miles from the shuttle terminal on January 11, but in reality they had clambered into the boot in the French capital.

'You had no regard for the safety of the family, and your actions put their lives at risk,' a magistrate told Johnson at the hearing on Friday.

He was jailed for 10 months and banned from returning to the region for three years after his release.

Migrants are taking increasingly dangerous risks to try to cross the channel in their attempts to start new lives in the UK.

Earlier this month, 17 migrants were found trying to reach Britain hidden in a cargo of talcum powder.

In December, 16 migrants were found in Calais hiding aboard a lorry-load of Christmas trees bound for Britain. 

Last year, two migrants were plucked to safety from the sea after trying to climb aboard a moving ferry off Calais.

The desperate refugees had swam almost half a mile from shore in a bid to clamber onto the vast 180m-long vessel heading to Dover.

Migrants have also risked their lives by smuggling themselves into refrigerated lorries, clinging to the axles of HGVs and even aboard a cargo of coffins. 

There are currently an estimated 2,500 migrants massed on the northern French coast hoping for a route across the channel.
