Photographs and steamy messages that Johnny Weir sent to men he met online while married to husband Victor Voronov have emerged, in the latest revelation in their bitter divorce battle.

The skater-turned-Olympic commentator met men on Grindr, a gay social network that shows men if they are near other members, and sent them full-front naked selfies, according to Radar.

The images and messages are just the latest revelations in a messy divorce case between 29-year-old Weir and his husband of two years, lawyer Victor Voronov.

In messages reportedly obtained by Radar, a man who identified himself as Weir asked another Grindr member if he lives nearby, although the location is not known.

Bitter battle: Johny Weir, right, and his husband of two years, Victor Voronov, left, are divorcing - and amid the split it has been claimed that Weir messaged other men through gay social network, Grindr

Weir allegedly told him: 'I'm a figure skater. We have a show here… What are you looking for here.'

The man, who has not been identified, responded: 'Cool. You must have strong legs.'

Weir also reportedly sent an image showing his reflection in a mirror.

Voronov has also claimed he has an image showing his ex's penis, Radar reported - but Weir has previously said he is not worried about such images surfacing.

'The worst that he could do is post naked photos that we have between each other and I look flawless,' he told Access Hollywood last month.

Weir filed for divorce from Voronov, whom he married at the end of 2011 after just months of dating, in February while working as a commentator for NBC at the Sochi Olympics.

Nasty divorce: Weir said he was not concerned about his ex sharing naked images of him following the split. He claimed Voronov physically and emotionally abused him

The split has sparked a series of bitter digs - from Weir claiming Voronov destroyed his beloved Birkin bags, and Voronov claiming his ex sent text messages to gay porn star Michael Lucas and engaged in threesomes.

Most recently, Voronov accused his estranged husband of sending a 'hateful' and 'disgusting' email and filed court papers saying Weir had violated a temporary restraining order by sending the email.

'Johnny sent Victor a disgusting, hateful email which violated the no contact order as part of the temporary restraining order he got last week,' a source told Radar.

Voronov had the restraining order put in place after an incident on March 5 in which Weir allegedly hit him on the arm and threw a wooden Russian doll at him.

'So on Monday, Victor filed a police 
report with cops in Rutherford, New Jersey,' the source added. 'Johnny could be in very serious legal trouble if the judge finds 
him in contempt for violating terms of the temporary restraining order.'

Exes: Voronov has claimed that Weir cheated on him throughout the relationship and said Weir recently sent him a 'hateful' email that violated a temporary restraining order he had out against his ex

Pettiness aside: The couple's bickering revolved around ownership of designer bags and other valuables including a Faberge egg. Voronov at one point claimed his figure skater husband held their dog Tema hostage

Voronov, 29, claims Weir committed multiple acts of adultery - 
including an affair with an unidentified Chicago club owner. He also says Weir is holding their dog Tema 
hostage.  

In legal 
documents obtained by TMZ, Voronov alleges Weir forced him out
 of the closet and that he married him because
 his life with a Georgetown-educated lawyer would make compelling 
reality TV.

In addition to the allegations of adultery and cruelty, Voronov is also requesting a judge to force Weir to return property the lawyer claims the Olympian took from him.

These include 20 furs - including a $125,000 coat made from sable - a crocodile Celine bag, 40 Balenciaga bags, one green and one orange Hermes Birkin and 12 Chanel bags.

He is also claiming temporary support and legal fees.

Olympic favorite: Weir was a hit as he commentated on the Sochi Olympics with Tara Lipinski earlier this year - but he has said that behind the scenes he was struggling with his demanding and emotionally abusive husband

A source close to Weir told TMZ that the property Voronov is requesting was the Winter Olympic commentators before their marriage.

The source also added that Weir 'categorically denies' the adultery allegations.

In an interview with Access Hollywood, Weir made his own swipes at his ex, claiming his non-practicing attorney husband was often abusive towards him and relied on his money.

He claimed he was struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner.

'Sochi was one of the hardest times in my life,' he said. 'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in.

'My husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.'

He added that their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police.

A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm.

Despite the fall out, however, the couple appeared together in a New Jersey court last month and a judge agreed to dismiss the case.

Weir announced their divorce on Twitter two weeks ago, writing: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.'

Despite the rocky relationship, Voronov said on his Twitter shortly afterwards that he had not been aware that Weir had filed for divorce until the announcement.

'Shocked by the abrupt ending of my marriage and am dealing with the trauma including multiple things I am just now becoming aware of...' he wrote.

Champion on ice: Weir competed in the 2010 
Vancouver Winter Olympics, finishing sixth place in the men's single 
competition, and was a hit in his first commentary stint at Sochi

He added: 'Yes. I'd like to confirm, It's true: I am only now finding out that my husband @johnnygweir filed for divorce from me months ago.'

Voronov's spokesperson, Wendy Feldman, added: 'It is our extreme hope and desire that this divorce could have been handled amicably. Not only is Victor heartbroken but he is now humiliated.'

Weir officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality.

On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov.

But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery.

'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'
