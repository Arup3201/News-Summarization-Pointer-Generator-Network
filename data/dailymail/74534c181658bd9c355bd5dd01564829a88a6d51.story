The transgender son who sparked a social media storm after his parents placed an amended birth notice in the newspaper says the moment he told his mother he was a boy was nothing special.

Kai Bogert, 19, said his mother accepted it with little fanfare and he described the event as 'extremely boring' and 'dull'.

'She said "Oh you're trans" and I said "Yeah" and she went "Oh cool", got up, gave me a hug and again went back to playing World of Warcraft,' Kai told The Today Show.

This 'birth' announcement appeared in Tuesday's edition of Queensland paper, The Courier Mail

Brisbane's Kai Bogert is 19 years old and was born Elizabeth Anne Bogert in 1995

Kai's mother Yolanda Bogert, who put the notice in the December 2 edition of The Courier Mail to correct their 'mistake' at announcing the birth of their daughter, agreed.

'It wasn't a big deal it wasn't anything,' Ms Bogert said.

'The social media hype's gone crazy but the moment itself wasn't very big.'

Ms Bogert said she placed the ad because she wanted to celebrate Kai's revelation.

'Somehow it just seemed like this big moment for him needed something to market, something he could keep,' she said. 

The 19-year-old, from Brisbane, born Elizabeth Anne now identifies as a man and goes by the name of Kai Bogert. 

'In 1995 we announced the arrival of our sprogget, Elizabeth Anne, as a daughter,' the loving message read.

'He informs us that we were mistaken. Oops! Our bad. We would now like to present, our wonderful son – Kai Bogert. Loving you is the easiest thing in the world.' 

A tweet of the notice has gone viral on Twitter, attracting almost 2,000 retweets in just eight hours

But the proud parents could not resist poking fun at the teenager and added: 'Tidy your room.' 

On the Today Show Kai said he was hoping for an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, and would tidy his room is Ellen asked him to. 

Placing the ad in the paper seemed like a 'no brainer' for Ms Bogert.

'I needed to show my son I support him 100 per cent and wanted to let the world know that,' she told The Courier Mail.

'It is all very new to us. Kai just told me a few days ago that he no longer wanted to live as a girl.'

Ms Bogert said there was always 'something different' about Kai who at first showed little signs but then later on it became more evident.

Shocked about his mum's openness, Kai said he was happy with what she had done.

Mr Bogert is yet to undergo a gender re-assignment procedure

'This last week has changed everything for me. I am still me but I am more me than I was a few days ago and feel free,' Kai told The Courier Mail.

Within eight hours of Twitter user Lisa Dart sharing a photo of the notice, it had been retweeted almost 2,000 times and favourited almost 1,800 times.

It attracted messages of support, including one from Ms Dart who wrote: 'Best Birth Announcement ever. Today's CM. What a wonderful family.'

The announcement also warmed the heart of Aunty Miche who said: 'Parentin, ur doin it rite (sic).'

While Goldie Pwn wrote: 'I wanna be this cool a Mom when I grow up.'

A gushing King K said: 'how cute is that!!!!' 

Kai is yet to undergo a gender re-assignment procedure and has not yet had any hormones.
