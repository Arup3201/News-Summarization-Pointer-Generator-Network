Meet a celebrity, visit the U.S and take a ride in a police car and fire engine - all could feature on the wish list of any nine-year-old.

But a closer look at the bucket list compiled by Romeo from British Columbia in Canada, reveals hidden clues to his identity.

'Get a pawicure' and 'take a trip to the first park where I first had walkies', are the dreams of the boxer dog seen through the eyes of his owner, Riina Cooke, 32.

Romeo was diagnosed with inoperable bone cancer by vets.

These pictures reveal the poorly pet pooch ticking off all 22 entries dreamt up by Ms Cooke for her treasured dog and best friend.

Romeo, the nine-year-old boxer, was diagnosed with inoperable bone cancer late last year. Determined to make the most of his last few days, his owner Riina Cooke, decided to compile his very own Bucket List

The last of the nine-year-old boxer's adventures was to visit the U.S.

Miss Cooke, 32, from British Columbia in Canada was devastated to learn her beloved companion was terminally ill, but vowed to enjoy a string of adventures with her pet pooch

On his ninth and final birthday, Romeo was treated to a 'pawicure'

Miss Cooke was so upset to hear the cancer diagnosis that she decided to fill Romeo's last four months with 'happy memories and adventures'.

She said: 'I was just so upset for the first few days, I needed to do something to occupy my mind.

'Osteacarcoma is not treatable. The only treatment is amputation and the rest of his body isn't strong enough as he was too old.

'I
 decided to put together a list of fun thing for us to do together, for 
example, riding a police car and fire engine, having a steak dinner, 
professional massage, try sushi and to go on a blind date with another 
boxer.

'We were able to complete them all and Romeo even visited the USA.'

To mark Romeo's ninth birthday, Miss Cooke arranged for him to be taken to a dog spa, where he was pampered and enjoyed a 'pawicure'.

Miss Cooke said the bucket list gave her precious memories of Romeo. She said: 'It gave my dog the chance to experience things most will never get chance to. I enjoyed spending so much time with him, I loved seeing him really happy'

In the months since he was diagnosed, he managed to complete all 22 of the dreams on his wish list, including taking a ride in a police car

And the poorly pooch added another of the emergency services to his list, getting the chance to take a ride in a fire engine, even dressing up in fire helmet and boots

Miss Cooke said she was inspired to write the list to make the most of her time left with Romeo, she said: 'I was just so upset for the first few days, I needed to do something to occupy my mind'

Miss Cooke said: 'I hope by sharing Romeo's bucket list on Facebook that it will bring light to other people who are going through something similar.

'It gave my dog the chance to experience things most will never get chance to.

'His favourite thing on the bucket list was definitely the steak dinner.

'I enjoyed spending so much time with him, I loved seeing him really happy.'

Soon after Romeo and Miss Cooke accomplished wish number 22, to visit the U.S., his condition declined.

'I made the heart breaking decision to put him down as he was in horrendous pain with his back legs,' she said.

Despite being petrified of losing her companion, Miss Cooke, who has no children, said she was inspired by a need to make Romeo's last days count.

Also on the list Miss Cooke compiled, was treating her best friend Romeo to a hamburger

We were able to complete them all and Romeo even visited the USA'

But four months after being diagnosed, vets had to put him to sleep on March 16 - but not before he had ticked everything off the bucket list.

She said: 'It was bittersweet, I had to let Romeo go, we had so many great memories together but it wasn't fair to keep him alive when he was in so much pain.

'Everyone loved him, he was such a kind hearted dog.'

After years of sharing her home with Romeo, Miss Cooke said she missed his company and has decided to welcome a new pooch, Elvis, into her home in Romeo's memory.

She added: 'I'll never forgot Romeo, he will always have a place in my heart, he was like my first child.

'Elvis will grow up knowing how brave his big brother, Romeo, was.

'I will also be documenting his adventures on Facebook too.'

Devastated by losing Romeo after vets had to put him to sleep on March 16, Miss Cooke now has a new boxer, Elvis, in Romeo's honour
