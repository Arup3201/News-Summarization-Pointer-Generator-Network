Costa Rica manager Jorge Luis Pinto believes England have been 'unlucky' at the World Cup and are favourites for Tuesday's clash.

Pinto's side have already qualified for the World Cup last 16 having beaten Uruguay and Italy, while Roy Hodgson's men lie bottom of Group D after defeats to the same opponents.

Yet Pinto says his side will not be underestimating England and is expecting an aggressive and committed performance from Hodgson's side as they try to salvage pride.

'It will be more complicated from here. Our opponents have seen us; they know us, what we have and what we don’t have. We’ve improved

'The mother of football cannot leave without points and that makes it very complex.

'It makes the match very hard. England must take some pride out of Brazil. They cannot just leave with crossed arms.

'This means it will be a head-to-head, a one-to-one match. Those who come into the team will give their all and fight for their position. We want to be No.1 in the group and we deserve to be it.

'It seems 
to be that maybe England were taken by surprise. They haven’t been lucky
 in finding the goal. They came to the box many times but did not score 
the goal.

'Above 
everything they will have pride. This will be aggressive. We will attack
 and have our own style of play. We will continue to do what we have 
done so far.

'We are happy in Brazil. I believe Costa Rica isn’t the favourite. England is favourite for many reasons. They have international players, the history, the jersey, many things. We are here in the fight, fighting to do things well. 

'We want 
to face England doing everything we have with an organised team 
tactically and if they want to win I think they can. Otherwise let’s see
 what happens.

'Costa Rica is a very organised country.
 We have been working since Dec 8 on preparation. That has given us a 
tranquility. Costa Rica is a country where everybody loves a football.

'Maybe we don’t have the connotation of 
England, Germany, Brazil, football, football, hooligans and so on but we
 love football, full stadiums in the qualifier sand indirectly it has 
forced this. Everyone lived up to what they had to do. I have to do my 
job 100% and I’ve done it. I hope we can continue and do more.'

Pinto was left furious last week when seven of his players were drug tested after the Italy game and he has called on FIFA to ensure other teams are tested just as thoroughly.

He said: 'We feel there’s a good faith from FIFA and we thank them
for the letter but we feel uncomfortable about it. Public opinion ended up thinking:
‘What do they fear?’ Do it every day, go to the training sessions, do controls
every day but don’t give out the idea there is something being hidden.

'The team
will continue to run, we’re very well prepared. Test every team the same. I
would like to see eight Brazilian players tested today, that the attitude is
balance. We’re not saying they shouldn’t do it but many felt they were doing
this because they saw the players run. This group of players are crystalline
pure, and that’s it.'
