The family of James DiMaggio, who kidnapped Hannah Anderson after killing her mother and brother, are asking for a DNA test because they believe he is her biological father.

A spokesman for James DiMaggio's family made the request after it was revealed he left $112,000 to Hannah's grandmother, who he named as the sole beneficiary of his life insurance policy.

DiMaggio, who was like an uncle to the 
Anderson children and their father's best friend, died in a shootout 
with FBI agents on August 10 in the Idaho wilderness six days after he set fire to his home.

Hannah 
was rescued and returned to Southern California. Her eight-year-old brother Ethan and mother Christina died from blunt force trauma.

tortured and killed before the fire

Andrew Spanswick told 10News.com: 'He expected the grandmother to take care of the two children with the 
money. He stated he did not want it to go to their parents because they 
were having marital problems and he didn't trust them with the money on 
their own

'We are requesting DNA samples from 
Hannah and anything they can get from Ethan. There are rumors Jim was 
the children's real father.

'The parents didn't marry until 2002. We think it's strange he left them so much money with no explanation.'

He also described Hannah's behavior as suspicious saying: 'Some things that Hannah is saying on her Facebook doesn't add up so far; her latest posts are disturbing.'

It is unclear what these Facebook posts are.

Stacy Hess, a spokesperson for Brett Anderson, said in a statement: 'Brett and Tina Anderson did not meet Mr DiMaggio until the sixth month of Tina’s pregnancy with Hannah.

'Brett Anderson’s DNA was used to identify the body of his dead son Ethan Anderson.'

When four horseback riders came across the 
16-year-old in the Idaho wilderness with DiMaggio they said she did not 
seem to be under duress. She later claimed it was all an act as she did not want to endanger them.

They later tipped off police, leading to the rescue of the teen and the shooting death of DiMaggio.

Search warrants unsealed last week said Hannah was picked up from a cheerleading practice at 4pm on August 4, but Caldwell said the practice was a day earlier.

Firefighters found the body of Christina Anderson, 44, when they extinguished flames at DiMaggio's home in Boulevard, a tiny town about 65 miles east of San Diego on the U.S.-Mexico border.

What remained: Firefighters found the bodies of

A search warrant says she was found near a crowbar and what appeared to be blood next to her head.

The San Diego County Medical 
Examiner's Office said she died of a blunt head injury, without 
elaborating on the nature of the wound or the circumstances of her death
 in a posting to its website. The manner of death is listed as homicide.

Investigators found eight-year-old Ethan Anderson's body as they sifted through rubble. Authorities identified his remains several days later by extracting DNA from his bone marrow.

The medical examiner's office said on Tuesday the cause and manner of the boy's death remained under investigation.

Hannah Anderson says she didn't learn her mother and brother died until after she was rescued. She said on a social media site last week that she was 'on the road to Idaho' when the fire ignited.

'He had set to wear (sic) it would catch on fire at a certain time,' she wrote.

A memorial service is scheduled Saturday for the mother and son in Santee, an east San Diego suburb.
