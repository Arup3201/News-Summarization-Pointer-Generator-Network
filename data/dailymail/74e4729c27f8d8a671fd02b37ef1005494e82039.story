The young lovers accused of Bali’s ‘body in the suitcase murder' are expected to be transferred to the island’s notorious Kerobokan Prison tomorrow, taking them one step closer to their first court appearance.

Legal sources on the holiday island told MailOnline that police interrogations of the pair have been completed and papers have been passed to the prosecution, allowing 19-year-old Heather Mack and her 21-year-old boyfriend Tommy Schaefer to be moved from police prisons.

They will then await a court appearance when they are expected to be charged with premeditated murder.

Chicago socialite Sheila von Wiese Mack, 62, was found dead inside a suitcase that was loaded into a taxi outside a luxury hotel on the Indonesian island

The pair were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the body of Heather’s mother, Chicago socialite Sheila von Wiese Mack, 62, stuffed into a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel.

Police claim the pair plotted Mrs Mack’s murder following an earlier argument between Heather and her mother over money.

But the lawyer for the teenager claims that the killing was not premeditated and that Heather had hid in the bathroom while her mother was bludgeoned to death in her hotel room.

According to a statement Miss Mack has given to police, she had no part in her mother’s murder, but went along with helping her boyfriend move the body out of a sense of duty because he was the father of her unborn baby, who is due in March.

The account she has given to police - which her lawyer Mr Raja Nasution hopes will result in her receiving a lesser charge  - paints a picture of a terrified young woman who waited in terror in the bathroom of room 317 while her boyfriend and her mother had a furious argument which resulted in Mrs Mack being beaten to death.

Senior Police Commissioner Djoko Hariutomo told MailOnline: ‘If they are both convicted of murder they could face the death penalty. There is evidence here of premeditation.’

The body of Mrs Mack, who had been bludgeoned to death, was found in a suitcase outside the St Regis Hotel

But Miss Mack has told a different story, explaining that she was horrified when her boyfriend struck her mother and ran from the bedroom.

‘Mr Schaefer had arrived at the hotel from the US at two o’clock in the morning of August 12 - just six hours before the murder - and Mrs Mack did not know he was coming,’ said Mr Raja.

‘In order to appease her mother, Heather suggested he go to her room and take with him a gift.’

That ‘gift’, police say, was a heavy fruit bowl from his room and, they insist, Schaefer did not intend to give it to her as a present because he was hiding it under his shirt, planning to use it to kill Mrs Mack following a fierce argument shortly after he arrived at the hotel.

The argument is said to have continued when Schaefer entered Mrs Mack’s room, his anger exploding when she referred to her daughter as expecting the child of a ‘n*****’. 

He is said to have angrily told Mrs Mack that her late husband was a ‘n*****’ and she is alleged to have replied: ‘Yes, but he was a rich one.’

Pregnant Miss Mack's lawyer will argue that she hid in the bathroom while her boyfriend and mother had an argument which led to Mrs Mack's death

It is understood that Miss Mack has told police that her mother had reached out and grabbed Schaefer around the throat - and it was at that moment that he struck her on the head with the fruit bowl - before continuing to batter her with it as her daughter hid in the bathroom.

As part of Miss Mack’s defence, her lawyer will argue that she had Mrs Mack’s blood on her shirt because she hugged her mother’s body.

‘Heather acted robot-like,’ said Mr Raja. ‘She wanted no part of what had happened but Mr Schaefer was the father of her child and she went along as if in a trance when he forced Mrs Mack’s body into the suitcase.’

Police have revealed that because the suitcase would not close properly with the body inside, the couple tied a sheet around it to keep the lid down - then placed it under their suitcases on a luggage trolley before accompanying a bellboy with it to a waiting taxi.

The couple then left the hotel but found they could not leave the country as their passports were in the hotel's safety deposit box, which only Mrs Mack had permission to open.

After checking into another hotel, the pair were arrested. .

A police spokesman said today that  Miss Mack will continue to be under medical observation while in Kerobokan Prison because she is pregnant.

It is understood she will have to share a cell with several other women prisoners because the jail is overcrowded.
