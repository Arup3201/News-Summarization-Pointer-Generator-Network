Homes have their own plainclothes security guards – or a concierge who will do everything from walk your dog to arranging a private jet. 

This is Britain’s most expensive street, where the average property sells for almost £17million. 

Grosvenor Crescent, in London’s Belgravia, topped a list of 50 exclusive addresses in a survey by Lloyds Bank. 

Britain's most expensive street: Grosvenor Crescent, in London’s Belgravia, topped a list of 50 exclusive addresses in a survey by Lloyds Bank

Despite the eye-watering prices, almost all of the properties on the 19th century crescent are flats rather than houses.  

Apartments on the Grade II-listed street, close to Hyde Park, are mainly owned by multi-millionaires from Russia, eastern Europe and the Middle East – many of whom use them as a second or third home. 

The next most expensive street was nearby Eaton Square, where property sells for an average of £15.5million and former residents include Nigella Lawson. 

The celebrity chef once owned a £25million home at the address and property tycoon Scot Young, who fell to his death this week from his flat in Marylebone, also owned an apartment there. 

London and the South East dominated the top 50 list of priciest streets – with the top ten all in the capital’s wealthy enclaves of Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Kensington, Chelsea and Notting Hill.

However there was an entry from the north of England. Houses in Park Lane in Altrincham, Cheshire, sell for about £2.5million and are occupied by entrepreneurs and Premier League footballers. 

The South West also had just one entry – the peninsula of Sandbanks in Poole, Dorset, where the average property also costs £2.5million. 

Yesterday, a security guard for a Qatari family who live in a flat in Grosvenor Crescent described the homes as ‘big, very big’. 

He said: ‘We always have security on guard and there is CCTV. If you’re a visitor, you have to arrange an appointment and then be searched when you come in.’ 

The street is also home to the Belgian embassy, while numbers 3-10 were for many years the headquarters of the British Red Cross before it was sold in 2005 for £30million and again in 2008 for £85million. 

The block is now owned by the Grosvenor Group – controlled by the Duke of Westminster, one of Britain’s wealthiest landowners. 

The firm has turned the building into lavish flats, some with their own private swimming pools, gyms and underground parking along with Italian marble floors. 

Aaron Harris, a concierge at the block, has everything from private jet companies to pet grooming services on speed dial for the block’s demanding residents.

This unique property on the peninsula of Sandbanks in Poole, Dorset , was sold for £6million in 2012. The average property on Sandbanks sells for £2.5million

He said recently: ‘Their own PAs are not always around at three or four o’clock in the morning and that’s where we come in.’ 

Outside the capital, the most expensive streets were in Oxshott, Surrey – where tennis ace Andy Murray lives. Homes there sell for over £3.6million. 

A separate regional breakdown reveals exclusive hotspots in Stratford-upon-Avon, Harrogate and Leicester.
