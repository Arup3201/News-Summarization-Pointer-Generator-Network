A new 24-hour Tube service at weekends will begin in the early hours of September 12 next year to coincide with the start of the Rugby World Cup.

The launch of the 'Night Tube' will see six trains operating every hour across central London lines including the Northern, Piccadilly and Jubilee lines.

The Rugby World Cup tournament will be hosted in 13 venues around the country, including three in London - Twickenham Stadium, Olympic Stadium and Wembley Stadium - and the new service will provide fans attending these matches, and the expected 400,000 overseas visitors into England, with additional transport options.

The 24-hour tube service was first promised by Mayor of London Boris Johnson and London Underground last November.

The service is expected to reduce night time journeys by an average of 20 minutes, with some cut by more than an hour. It will also support London's businesses, jobs and leisure opportunities.

In order to meet expected demand, there will be six trains per hour through central London on all Night Tube lines, including the Jubilee, Victoria and most of the Piccadilly, Central and Northern lines. 

On the Northern line, there will be eight trains per hour to meet demand at busy stations between Leicester Square and Camden Town.

Mr Johnson said: 'London is a bustling, 24-hour global city and by this time next year we'll have a 24-hour Tube service to match.

'Running trains all through the night was once thought impossible, but with the huge investment we've put in and upgrades that have been delivered we stand ready to take the Tube to the next level.

'As well as creating vital new jobs and giving a huge boost to our economy, the Night Tube will help millions of people to get around our city more easily and quickly. The evolution of the Night Tube will without doubt make London an even better place to live, work, visit and invest.'

It comes as Mr Johnson recently released proposals for a large extension to the Bakerloo line beyond Elephant & Castle through south-east London.

Possible new stops south could include Old Kent Road and New Cross to Lewisham, Catford, Beckenham and Bromley.

Earlier this year Mr Johnson was accused of breaking promises he had made stating there would be no London Tube ticketing office closures.

The planned office closures this year - which were strongly opposed by the unions - were one of the key issues that led to strikes widely condemned by Mr Johnson and London Underground leaders.

Mr Johnson has said he hopes to prevent such strikes occurring in future by introducing rules requiring a majority of union members to vote in favour of the strike.

Existing rules mean unions can order industrial action be securing only a majority among members who vote in a ballot.

However, his proposed extension to the Bakerloo line has been highly anticipated.

The upgrade, which will extend past Elephant & Castle into south-east London, is expected to relieve congestion on National Rail routes into the City and generate about £400 in annual economic benefits.

However the upgrade would not occur until 2040. 

However, if it were to go ahead it is not expected to be upgraded until 2040.

Mike Brown, managing director of LU, said: 'We are now less than a year away from the first ever 24-hour services operating on London Underground. Already over half a million Londoners use the Tube after 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays, and the introduction of the Night Tube, which will cut journey times and open up new possibilities across the night time economy, is a historic step in our modernisation of the Underground. 

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said the organisation welcomed the 24-hour service but wanted to ensure it was not going to be a 'low cost, low maintenance' service.

He said: 'With Boris still wanting to axe 900 jobs and close all ticket offices, we want to ensure that the new service is properly staffed to ensure safe and secure travel for all passengers and that weekend maintenance work is not postponed to disrupt weekday services.'

News of the 24-hour was met with cynicism from Mick Cash, Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary, who claimed it was a 'diversion' from the mayor's 'massive cuts and closures programme that will axe a thousand staff and decimate services and safety'.

Relations between RMT and London Underground have been tense in recent months with a series of strikes organised. In May, a three-day strike that would have crippled parts of the train network was called off at the last minute following constructive talks.
