Trial: Jeremy Forrest (pictured yesterday upon his arrival at Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex), 30, pursued the 'vulnerable' pupil for months, a jury was told

The runaway schoolgirl described to a court yesterday how she fell in love with her ‘mature’ teacher Jeremy Forrest, seven months before they fled to France.

The 15-year-old told how they exchanged flirtatious messages and a clear ‘atmosphere’ developed when they were together before they started a sexual relationship.

But she told police how she ‘panicked’ last September, when her mother called to say the police and a child protection officer had come to visit her home.

She said: ‘I didn’t want to face it basically seeing my mum when she found out.

‘Obviously he didn’t want to get caught. He was scared.’

Her former teacher Forrest wept and held his head in his hands in the dock as the video of a police interview with his pupil conducted shortly after she returned home from France was played to Lewes Crown Court.

The schoolgirl told how a crush turned to love on a school trip to Los Angeles in February last year.

She said: ‘I was drawn to him, I was attracted to him. We had similar interests.

'I hadn’t felt the way I felt about him before, that’s why I use the term falling in love. There was an attraction from me to him without him having to do anything.’

The schoolgirl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared in court as a witness via video link.

Wearing a plain sleeveless black dress, she fiddled with her necklace as the judge spoke to her.

It was the first time her former maths teacher had seen her since he was arrested by police in France last September, after they spent eight days together on the run.

Forrest briefly raised a smile as he watched the schoolgirl telling interviewers how she initially didn’t like him when he first taught her when she was 13.

She began to develop a crush on the teacher – who she called ‘sir’ or ‘Mr Forrest’ at school – around Christmas 2011, she said.

‘That was when it was more than a teacher-pupil crush, I found him attractive,’ she said.

‘I had had boyfriends and crushes on other people but he was older, it was a lot more different, I liked that he was older and mature. I think I kind of led it but he followed up to what I was doing.’

She added: ‘You could feel the atmosphere... it was pretty obvious.’

During the trip to LA she was embarrassed by him seeing her in her bikini in the swimming pool. She also told how he gave her a hug and that they held hands on the flight home because they were both frightened.

She began paying more attention to him in class and the pair began texting each other increasingly amorous messages last year.

‘But we didn’t start a relationship until the end of May and we decided that it was what we wanted to do.

‘Around this time, we began to meet up outside of school. There were a few times when I would go over to his house ... and after that things got even more serious.’

‘The school warned us a bit but never really did a full investigation. Things stayed like that until the summer holidays when we began a sexual relationship.’

She said at that point they began to plan seriously running away, something they had previously discussed but only as a ‘fantasy’.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
