Inspiration: Sandra d'Auriol before her death

Some people fill the space around them with a kind of life force, and my friend Sandra d’Auriol was just such a person.

I could hardly believe it when I received an email from her family, telling me of her violent death, plummeting from the roof of a 15-storey building in Beverly Hills, on the morning of January 22.

Sandra had gone to Los Angeles to have a straightforward cosmetic surgery operation in a renowned Beverly Hills clinic. The operation lasted 13 hours, after which she was removed to a recovery room under 24-hour nursing supervision.

A few hours later she came round in a state of panic and paranoia, which the doctors described as post-anaesthetic psychosis. This apparently happens in around 2 per cent of such procedures. She overpowered the nurse, stripped off her clothes and ran towards the first exit.

Sandra made her way to the roof, where she stayed for over three hours, alternately sitting and teetering along the edge. A team of doctors talked to her, but she was unresponsive. Eventually she stood up, and leapt off the building to her death.

Even as I write this, I cannot imagine a more horrible, frightening and awful way to die.

In every article I have read about Sandra this week, she has been written of — or off — as a ‘socialite’. She was so much more than that.

I first met Sandra in the early Eighties, when I was running the marketing department at Asprey, the jewellers, in Bond Street. She was 19, and the youngest person in my team.

She already had a poise about her, and a self-assurance and serenity that was older than her years. Five of us shared an office tucked away in the Dickensian labyrinth of the Asprey building.

Sandra’s innate sense of design was apparent in everything that she did, from the layout of the catalogues to how a window display was arranged. She always had an opinion, quietly but emphatically stated, and invariably right.

She was always immaculately groomed, and I can still see her — vividly — striding down Bond Street on her endlessly long legs, with a clipboard and pen, taking notes on the window displays, then making seemingly minute alterations which immediately made an enormous difference.

Sandra worked with me at Asprey for three years, but was becoming increasingly frustrated at having no direct outlet for her evident and growing jewellery-design talents.

One day, I remember bringing to the office an amber necklace given to me by my step grandmother. Three weeks later, this previously old-lady necklace was transformed into a bohemian chain, with additions of carved golden beads and black glass.

Last March, when Sandra was in London, I wore it when we met for lunch. ‘Not bad,’ she said of it, ‘not bad at all.’

In 1983 Sandra had an opportunity to go to Hong Kong. At the time she was in a relationship that had run its course, but she didn’t quite have the courage to admit it.

Day after day she would appear bleakly in the office, unable to decide what to do with her life. Finally I took her out to lunch, and said that I was going to make the decision for her. I told her that if she didn’t take the opportunity to go to Hong Kong, I would fire her.

In an email to me last year, she mentioned this: ‘How right you were to push me out of the door of England all those years ago … never looked back … though I do sometimes ache for the English countryside, especially old trees and dank earth.’

She quickly established herself in Hong Kong, and eventually met and married Frenchman Yan d’Auriol, a former L’Oreal executive, with whom she had three children.

Her creative energy went into designing unusual one-off pieces of jewellery, oriental in style, using carved jade, semi-precious stones and beaten silver.

She became highly successful, (as I knew she would be) and organized exhibitions all over the world. For many years she had a collection at the upmarket Chinese fashion boutique Shanghai Tang in London.

Sandra co-founded a charity called the Child Welfare Scheme, for children in Nepal, which was funded with the profits from her business.

She was that rare combination - a creative talent and a successful business woman. She enjoyed all of the good things that she and her husband had worked for, but never, ever forgot those less fortunate than herself.

She started an appeal after the recent terrible typhoon in the Philippines, and raised a substantial amount of money and goods. Not content with doing that, she got on a plane with Yan, and helped on the ground with the distribution of disaster aid.

There are wealthy women whose involvement in charity work consists just of attending fundraising dinners and getting their names on committees, but Sandra got involved at the sharp end. She was genuinely compassionate, and never in it for any mentions she might receive in fashionable magazines.

We kept in touch intermittently over the years, and I would see her when she came through London. Each time I saw her she looked increasingly glamorous, but underneath she was still the same down-to-earth Sandra.

She would, on every occasion, say how blessed she felt - surrounded by her family, and doing work that she loved. She had an elusive presence, which is difficult to capture on the page.

Her most overwhelming characteristic was an absolute serenity. The precocious self-assurance of her late teens had matured into an almost tangible calmness. Yoga, for Sandra, was almost a way of life.

In 2004, on the last day of a family holiday in Bali, her son, Teo, died in a swimming accident. He had gone to the pool for a final swim, and was doing underwater laps when he lost consciousness. He was 12 years old.

Sandra’s strength in coping with the death of her only son was humbling to witness. She accepted that his allotted time on earth had ended, and told me that she felt blessed to have had the time she did with him.

A few years later, she came to see me at our home in Sussex. She brought copies of a painting that Teo had done shortly before he died.

I remember the vivid colours, a rainbow on a bridge, with a figure half way across, seen through an arch of light (Teo had clearly inherited his mother’s artistic sense).

Sandra was convinced that Teo had some intimation of his own mortality, and that this painting was his subliminal way of expressing it... his last good bye.

Sandra was not a conventionally religious person, but she believed in God, and had a deep spirituality. In my study I have a photograph she sent me, taken on that last family holiday.

The photo portrays a tight family group: Yan and Sandra and their beautiful girls, with Teo smiling cheekily in the centre. I look at it now, and weep for them all.

Some people are described as life-enhancing. Sandra was more than that; she was life-affirming. I can hear her mellifluous voice as I sit at my computer.

I am as certain as I can be that she would not want anyone to grieve for her for too long. She will be with Teo, and she would want us to understand this, and celebrate that reunion.

From there, she’d want us to celebrate her life, and the joy and passion with which she lived it.

Her memorial service is being held in St John’s cathedral in Hong Kong, which held a special place in her heart. Friends are being asked not to send flowers - Sandra abhorred the waste of flowers at ceremonies - but to dress in bright colours ‘to create the most colourful and precious bouquet of all for Sandra: one made up of her beloved friends and family’.

The last email I received from Sandra was on December 29. She had spent Christmas in the Philippines with Yan and the girls, her parents and Yan’s family. She wrote: ‘It is good to be able to give back a little of the love we were given.’  

Sandra gave love in abundance. I still cannot believe that she has gone, and am devastated for all those she has left behind.

The words she wrote for Teo’s funeral in November 2004 seem all the more poignant now: ‘Sharing this pain has helped us understand what it means to be surrounded by love, your prayers have bolstered us, your voices have soothed us: in this moment of utter pain we have found a strength... we will find a way to come to terms with Teo’s death. It is truly at a moment like this that one understands the meaning of the word love.’

I pray that Sandra’s family will be able to draw on her strength and love, which must surely live on in their hearts.
