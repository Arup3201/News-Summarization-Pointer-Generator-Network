Burnley have confirmed the signing of George Boyd for £3million from Hull City and defender Michael Keane from Manchester United on a four-month loan deal.

The newly-promoted side are looking to add quality to the solidity in their squad which saw them earn a draw against Manchester United on Saturday.

Keane, 21, has made just five appaearances for United, and despite playing in the 1-1 draw with Sunderland last week, has decided to move on for the short-term.

Sean Dyche has long been an admirer of the Scottish international Boyd, who joined Hull from Peterborough last summer after a successful loan spell.

Boyd performed well for the Tigers in the Championship, helping them win promotion, but has been on the periphery since making the move permanent.

And with Steve Bruce's side out of the Europa League, Hull have allowed him to leave the club. 

However, the manager paid tribute to the Scotland international, saying: 'I've been in the game a long time and if all professional footballers were like George Boyd my job would be easy.'
