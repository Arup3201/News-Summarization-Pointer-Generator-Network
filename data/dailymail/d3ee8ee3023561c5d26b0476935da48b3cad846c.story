The prosecution of an experienced journalist for investigating alleged corruption by an MP has the ‘hallmark of oppressive regimes’, a court heard yesterday.

Nick Parker, The Sun’s Chief Foreign Correspondent, is accused of looking at texts and emails on MP Siobhain McDonagh’s mobile phone after it was stolen from her car.

He had been told there was evidence of ‘criminality’ on it including messages about ‘bribery’.

Mr Parker, 53, is also accused of paying a policeman for information which led to stories about how officers merely cautioned then England football captain John Terry’s mother after a £1,450 shoplifting spree and pop star Ronnie Wood when he assaulted his girlfriend.

Yesterday Trevor Burke QC, defending Parker, told the Old Bailey it is the ‘very basic right’ of a journalist to ‘expose hypocrisy’

Yesterday Trevor Burke QC, defending Parker, told the Old Bailey it is the ‘very basic right’ of a journalist to ‘expose hypocrisy’. He said Mr Parker went to look at the MP’s phone – which he believed had been left on a train – after being told that there was evidence of ‘criminality’.

After realising the texts were clearly a joke he did not run a story and told a tipster he must hand the phone into the police.

But Mr Parker is now standing trial accused of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, handling stolen goods and securing unauthorised access to computer material.

Yesterday, in his closing submission to the jury, Mr Burke said: ‘On any level and on every level this is a disturbing and worrying case where a journalist who only reports the news honestly, accurately and fearlessly is prosecuted in a criminal court.

‘From the perspective of Nick Parker that is exactly what is happening today.

‘You are all familiar with journalists who have been silenced by the courts in the past and it has been the hallmark of oppressive regimes.’

He told jurors: ‘The 12 of you are invited to shoot the messenger simply for being an accurate and truthful messenger.’

Two stories provided by policeman Alan Tierney about Wood and Mr Terry’s mother were ‘plainly in the public interest’, the QC added. Tierney previously admitted misconduct in public office and has now left the force, the court was told.

Mr Parker, from Twickenham in South West London, denies all the charges.

The trial continues.
