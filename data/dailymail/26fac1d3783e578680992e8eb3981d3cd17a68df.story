Barack Obama's campaign wanted Hillary Clinton to make a sexist attack on Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential election, she revealed today.

Clinton revealed in an interview with NBC that, 'The day [Palin] was nominated, the Obama campaign did contact me and asked me if I would attack her.'

'I said, "Attack her for what — for being a woman? Attack her for being on a ticket that's trying to draw attention? There'll be plenty of time to do what I think you should do in politics, which is draw distinctions," ' Clinton recalled.

Clinton also described the run-in over Palin in her just released memoir Hard Choices.

The 2008 presidential candidate writes in the book that, 'The Obama campaign suspected that her nomination was a blatant attempt to scuttle their hope of welcoming the women who had vigorously supported me. They immediately issued a dismissive statement and reached out to me in hopes I would follow suit.'

'But I wouldn't. I was not going to attack Palin just for being a woman appealing for support from other women. I didn't think it made political sense, and it didn't feel right. So I said no...''

Sarah Palin posted a picture of the passage on her twitter account last night, with the caption, 'Look who fired the 1st shot in the real "war on women". Hint: it wasn't the GOP. See this excerpt from Hillary's book.'

In an interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer that aired last night, Clinton confessed that she was didn't do a very good job during the 2008 presidential campaign of pointing out that 'there is a double standard' for women in the public eye.

'And I think part of what I did not do was to be more clear in saying, "Look, this is a problem in our country. And people oughtta think about 
their own daughters, their own sisters, their own mothers when they make
 comments about women in public life, whether they're in politics or the
 media or anywhere else," ' Clinton said.

Clinton is making the rounds on the major news networks this week to promote Hard Choices, which was released today. The book provides a glimpse into the last six years of at her life and the problems she and her colleagues were confronted with while she was serving as secretary of state.

Her full interview with NBC will air tonight during the network's Nightly News program at 7pm EST.

NBC News' Cynthia McFadden said on the Today show this morning that the former secretary of state told her during their sit-down interview that she allowed the White House to review her book before it went to print because it included accounts from the time she served in the president's cabinet.

Clinton reportedly told McFadden that Obama's team did not ask her to take anything out.

Based
 on early reviews of the book, there wasn't much for the White House to 
complain about outside of Clinton's unflattering charge of sexism within
 the president's 2008 presidential campaign.

Hard Choices is 'a newsless snore' that was 'written so 
carefully not to offend that it will fuel the notion that politics 
infuses every part of her life,' Politico's  Mike Allen charged in his morning newsletter on Monday.

One of the only other hard-hitting events that Clinton discusses in the book is the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and she spends the bulk of that chapter defending herself and critics of U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice.

Otherwise, the book is a laudatory pamphlet supporting the Obama administration's foreign policy decisions, regardless of whether Clinton agreed with them at the time or not, reviewers are saying.

'Clinton’s account is the low-salt, 
low-fat, low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert,' Slate's John Dickerson said.
