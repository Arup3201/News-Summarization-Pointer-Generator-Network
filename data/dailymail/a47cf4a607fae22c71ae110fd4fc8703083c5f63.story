Two women and a dog were miraculously rescued Sunday after their 3-story apartment building suddenly collapsed on Chicago's South Side.

Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford says the collapse of the just 3-year-old building after 7pm in the Washington Park neighborhood 'pancaked all floors toward the basement.'

Miraculously, the women--one in her 70s who lived on the top floor and another in her 50s--were both alert when they were pulled from the rubble.

A pit bull named Tigger was rescued, as well.  

Rubble: Morning brought this upsetting view of a pile of rubble that was once one of the Chicago area's newest buildings

Miraculous: Two women and a dog were miraculously pulled alive from this pile of rubble that was once a 3-story apartment building on Chicago's South Side

Unbelievable: The women--one in her 70s who lived on the top floor and one in her 50s--were both in serious to critical condition when they were rescued and both were awake and able to speak

Neighbors told the Chicago Tribune they first heard one or possibly two very loud booms followed by a flash of blue light.

Then the entire building was reduced to rubble.

'Boom. It was the loudest explosion I ever heard,' neighbor McKiley Jonkins told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Once the building went down, several residents ran outside to a shocking scene. 

The air remained thick with dust several minutes. When that finally settled, debris could be seen covering cars parked on nearby streets and piled up where there once stood a nearly brand new three-story building.

'That thing that looks like it is the roof' said neighbor Angela Brooks told WFLD, 'is kind of sitting on the front of my car.' 

Collateral damage: Cars parked on the street near the 3-year-old home were covered in debris as well, some were even totaled

Search and rescue: Rescuers worked into the night Sunday to sift through the debris and ensure no one else was there to be rescued, though neighbors said there was no one else in the buidling

'Who would really make it out of something like this?' Jonkins remembered thinking.

Langford said the older woman was awake and talking when she was taken to the hospital in serious to critical condition.

The younger woman was rescued earlier and was also in serious to critical condition. She was also alert at the time.

As they begin to heal, investigators will start piecing together what caused their brush with tragedy. 

Langford said the cause was unknown, but authorities were working with the utility companies to make sure there wasn't a problem with the gas line.
