Madonna Badger lost her three young daughters nearly three years ago in a tragic Christmas Day house fire, but she says she's been able to overcome her grief thanks to the spiritual support of her children who have appeared to her in moments of despair.

In a recent interview with Oprah, the 50-year-old advertising executive reflects on Christmas morning 2011, the day she lost her 9-year-old Lily, 7-year-old twins Sarah and Grace and parents Pauline and Lomer Johnson when her Stamford, Connecticut home caught fire. 

Ms Badger and her then-boyfriend Michael Borcino were the only survivors. Her ex-husband Matthew Badger blames Borcino for the blaze and death of his children, which officials said started when Mr Borcino left a bucket of still-smoldering fireplace embers in the home's mud room.

Heart to heart: Ms Badger talked about the spiritual experience during an interview with Oprah, nearly three years after the house fire 

Despite the incredible loss, Ms Badger has managed to return to work and even find love in long-time friend William Duke, with whom she tied the knot this summer. 

In her emotional talk on Oprah's Super Soul Sundays,  Ms Badger describes how her children once reached out to her when she hit the rock-bottom of grief. 

Ms Badger says she starting intensely crying in the bathroom one day, when she looked in the mirror and thought: 'Wow that woman is in a lot of pain'. 

She says her daughter Sarah then appeared in the reflection along with the other victims of the fire. 

'Then Sarah came to me and  Lily and Grace and everybody was there,' Ms Badger told Oprah, 'And Sarah talked to me and she told me not to be afraid - that there was nothing to be afraid of and that love was the most important thing in the world. And that dreams are more real than this life.' 

Ms Badger immediately called her friend, to tell her of the 'mind-blowing' experience. 

'I said: "This is real, It is real, it is real. You know I'm not making this up. They're really talking to me.' 

Wrecked: Officials in Stamford, Connecticut ruled that the fire started because of a bucket of still-smoldering embers placed in the home's mud room. But Ms Badger believes an electrical issue was the real source of the fire

While Ms Badger does not claim to see visions of her children often, she does admit to feeling their presence when she's feeling good. 

'When I get bitter and really angry, I don't feel my children,' she said. 

Ms Badger also describes her happy final night her her family, when her mother Pauline backed her famous apple pie and sugar cookies. And her father returned home from his seasonal job working as Santa at Saks Fifth Avenue.

The next morning she woke up to thick smoke in the house and despite her desperate attempts, was not able to save any of her children. 

In the aftermath of the blaze, it was revealed that her boyfriend Mr Borcino was leading two of the girls out of the house when both bolted back into the flames to their deaths. 

After an investigation, Connecticut officials ruled the house had caught fire after Mr Borcino swept up embers in one of the home's fireplaces and places the still-smoldering embers in the mud room.

However, Ms Badger tells Oprah that she doesn't believe that's what started the fire - since she saw a nearby electrical box spew sparks in the middle of the fire. 

'Something really major happened,' Ms Badger said. 'I don't know what happened but I think someone does. I think there's got to be someone out there who knows what happened...and my prayer is that they are going to come forth and tell the truth.' 

She has since filed a lawsuit against the city and two officials who ordered her house knocked down the day after the fire. 

She says that action prevented them from conducting a thorough investigation. 

Ms Badger has had a unimaginably difficult past three years, but there has been some happiness as well. 

Last year she returned to work at the advertising company she helped found,  Badgers & Winters. 

'It does help a lot,' Ms Badgers said. 'It gives me purpose and makes me feel good about what I'm doing.' 

She also found rekindled her friends with real-estate broker William Duke, and the two eloped this summer in Brooklyn. 

The couple have known each other since Ms Badger was 19 and she call Mr Duke her 'rock'. 

While she admits feeling suicidal in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, she says she is now determined to live the best life possible in order to make her daughter's proud.   

She found love! This summer, Ms Badger married long-time friend William Duke, a real-estate broker, in a small ceremony in Park Slope, Brooklyn
