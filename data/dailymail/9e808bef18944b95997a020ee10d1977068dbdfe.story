A toddler has become his mother's hero after using FaceTime to save her from a vicious dog attack.

Laura Toone, from Tucson, Arizona, had taken a foster dog she was caring for out for a walk when it attacked one of her own dogs.

She tried breaking up the fight but the dog nearly bit one of her fingers off, leaving her covered in blood.

Then two-year-old Bentley Toone stepped in.

He ran out of the house with a dish towel from the kitchen to help his mother mop up the blood.

Bentley, who is known for making his share of prank FaceTime calls, called a friend on her iPhone. Thankfully, this time the friend didn't think it was a joke.

Mrs Toone told ABC News reported: 'I begged my daughters to call 911 
and they're four and they were quite afraid to even touch the phone 
because it was covered in my own blood.

'Here
 comes my son from the kitchen bringing me our dish towel,' she said. 
'He wiped off the blood himself and proceeded to call my friend on 
FaceTime.'

Connie Guerrero said: 'Something inside of me just told me that I needed to answer this FaceTime. All I could see was his little forehead and I said, "hi, Bentley,Â£ and it was quiet for a little bit and then I hear Laura screaming.'

Guerrero then called 911 and Bentley unlocked the door when firefighters arrived. Mrs Toone said she has since taught their three children how to call 911.
