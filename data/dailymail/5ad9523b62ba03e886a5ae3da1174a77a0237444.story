A man from upstate New York who decided to fly a drone outside of a medical center and film it was arrested last night.

David Beesmer, 49, who also goes as 'Front Row Dave' has been charged with felony unlawful surveillance for flying the drone outside the examination room windows where patients were being treated, according to the police report.

Cops say that staff  and sick patients at Mid Hudson Medical Group which opened on Monday in Ulster, New York 'observed the contraption.'

David Beesmer, 49, was charged with a felony unlawful surveillance count for piloting a drone about 10 to 15 feet from a medical facility in Ulster

The Smoking Gun reports that Beesmer describes his decision to film as a 'huge error in judgement.'

His facebook page states, 'took my drone up in the air to capture some very brief footage.'

He said that since the windows were tinted, no footage of anyone inside of the facility was captured.

Beesmer decided to use his drone after taking his mom to the medical center for an appointment and noticing the beautiful new building which was once abandoned property.

'I am so very proud of this facility and that someone has done something positive with the property that has been abandoned for many years.

'I truly realize that I should have asked first but did not think it would be an issue….only to discover that it sure is.'

Beesmer said that this one little incident won't stop him from flying his $1300 play thing.

'I will not stop droning....this is the wave of the future...and I WILL be a part of it,' he declared.

David Beesmer says he won't stop droning anytime soon because it's 'the future'

Beesmer's drone cost him $1300 and flew successfully outside the medical center
