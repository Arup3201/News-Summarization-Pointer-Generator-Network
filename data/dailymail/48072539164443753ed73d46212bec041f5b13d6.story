Killed: Jonathan Barnes (above) was mistakenly shot by his friend Daniel Tesfay as the pair tried to steal fake designer watches from a man in south London, the Old Bailey was told

A robber shot his friend dead by mistake as they tried to steal designer watches, the Old Bailey heard today.

Daniel Tesfay, 26, and Jonathan Barnes, 20, had agreed to buy what they thought were Rolex watches for £6,500.

But after they made the deal in a house in Croydon, south London, in August last year, Mr Barnes grabbed the watches and shouted 'let’s do it', jurors were told.

Tesfay produced a semi-automatic pistol and threatened seller Jordaan Williams, said Roger Smart, prosecuting.

But Mr Williams grabbed Mr Barnes as the men tried to flee and Tesfay again threatened him.

Mr Smart said: 'Jordaan Williams again grabbed hold of Jonathan Barnes and on this occasion Daniel Tesfay then shot at him, but missed and instead shot and killed his fellow robber.'

Barnes was shot in the head and died two days later.

Tesfay allegedly fled, taking the gun with him.

The watches were fakes and worth little, added Mr Smart.

Tesfay, of no fixed address, denies murdering Mr Barnes, of Lewisham, south London.

He has also pleaded not guilty to having a firearm with intent to endanger life.

The trial continues.
