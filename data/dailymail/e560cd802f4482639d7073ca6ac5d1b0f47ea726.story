Felipe Massa crashed out of the German Grand Prix after a high-speed collision with Kevin Magnussen on the first corner of the Hockenheim circuit on Sunday.

The Brazilian and his car were flipped over after Magnussen clipped the rear of Massa's Williams before sliding upside down and flipping back over.

Massa seemed to be relatively injury-free after the crash, but his race was over as Magnusson managed to continue with damage to his front right tyre.

Daniel Ricciardo did brilliantly to avoid the danger but his maneuvering caused the Red Bull driver to slip down the field.

Speaking shortly after the crash, Massa said: 'I am very frustrated because first of all it is a race where I had a good car.

'I didnâ€™t want to be too aggressive at the first corner and fighting with my team-mate.

'I backed off a little bit and then another car just hit me behind and there is nothing I can do. It is really disappointing.'

The crash is a huge blow for Massa who had completed a day to remember for Williams in qualifying along with Valtteri Bottas as the pair finished third and second, respectively.

'Well done to everyone but Mercedes is still ahead,' Bottas said. 'I really felt I got everything out of the car today."

Magnussen claimed a commendable fourth place for McLaren, and the Dane was followed by Red Bull's Ricciardo and Sebastian Vettel in fifth and sixth.

'Other people were able to get more and more out of the track whereas we seemed to stabilize around a certain lap time,' Vettel said. 'It's a long race, anything can happen.'
