ME AFTER YOU: A TRUE STORY ABOUT LOVE, LOSS AND OTHER DISASTERS by Lucie Brownlee (Virago £11.99)

They always say you should begin a book with a killer first line, and Lucie Brownlee certainly does that. ‘I knew He was dead,’ she writes.

The He whom she reverently capitalises throughout her book (to disconcerting effect, as though she were writing about the Almighty) is — was — her 37-year-old husband, Mark, who collapsed and died two years ago while they were making love in Lucie’s mother’s bed.

‘She was out at the time, I hasten to add,’ Lucie explains, with the mordant humour that makes her memoir of early widowhood such a wrenchingly funny read. Mark’s last words were: ‘You’ve still got your socks on.’

Devoted: Lucie and Mark on their wedding day in 2006. Two years later she became an early widow.

‘Hardly the Humphrey Bogart of last words,’ remarks his widow.

The circumstances of Mark’s sudden collapse read like a Gothic tragi-comedy, but, until then, his married life with Lucie had been idyllic. They fell in love at first sight in 2002, married in 2006 and, two years later, their daughter, ‘B’, was born.

They lived in North Yorkshire, in a house specially chosen for its diminutive size — ‘Like Mr and Mrs Tickle, we liked to be able to reach out and touch each other’ — and Mark commuted to his job as a security analyst at GCHQ in Cheltenham.

It was on a late summer’s day in 2008 that the first shadow fell over their perfect family. Unable to contact Mark by phone, Lucie rang GCHQ to find that he hadn’t turned up for work. Ten minutes later the hospital called. Mark had managed to summon an ambulance before collapsing with an aortic dissection — a tear in the wall of the artery carrying blood from the heart.

‘Is it life-threatening?’ Lucie asked. ‘I can’t answer “No” to that,’ the consultant replied.

Three months later, and three stone lighter having suffered a stroke during open-heart surgery, Mark came home.

‘He’d been given a second chance and He was going to take it with both hands,’ Lucie writes.

Four years on, that’s exactly what he was doing.

They were visiting Lucie’s mum for her grandma’s funeral. The previous autumn, Lucie had suffered a miscarriage. Now, they were trying for another baby.

‘Those who become embroiled in the complicated world of conception know that there is a “moment” during the month at which all systems must absolutely go . . . this wasn’t going to be the Barry White of sessions. It was business . . . And besides, Take Me Out was starting in ten minutes, so we had to be quick.’

Lucie’s memoir, which started life as a very personal blog, is a raw howl of disbelief at the speed with which a baby-making quickie could turn to life-shattering tragedy.

On the whole, society prefers widows to be dignified, composed and, as soon as decently possible after the funeral, invisible.

Lucie was none of those. She held it together for long enough to give a magnificent, tearless eulogy at Mark’s funeral, after which she wept uncontrollably, replacing the lost fluid with gallons of red wine, occasionally varied with champagne or tequila.

She raged at her mum. She blighted family gatherings with her inconsolable grief. She was unable even to function fully as a newly single parent.

Lucie  was often at her wit's end but hers is a story of survival (posed by model)

During evenings of ‘wine and late-night TV, interspersed with pangs of longing for my husband and my previous life . . . I would wake up, sometimes on the settee, but often in bed alongside my child, not remembering how either of us had got there.’

Most startlingly of all, a year after Mark’s death from catastrophic heart arrhythmia, Lucie embarked on a vigorous sexual relationship with a luridly tattooed local plumber — ‘With him, I felt I was immune to the curse of death by intercourse.’

Me After You is, despite everything, a story of survival and, cautiously, recovery. It is very funny about the grim trappings of sudden death, from sinisterly chirpy funeral directors to the horror of cancelling Mark’s insurance policies: ‘So your husband died, Lucie, yeah! Brilliant! OK, I’m gonna need to take some details . . .’

It certainly doesn’t draw a veil over the bad bits. One of the worst moments came when Lucie posted a link to her blog on a website for young widows where she had found comfort, only to be informed by the site’s founder that her diary was ‘moronic’ and that she was henceforth banned.

The fact that her blog later won an award and is now published as a book must feel like a triumphant vindication. But the real triumph is that she survived, sustained by her own gritty strength, and with lots of help from her family, her little daughter, her endlessly understanding friends, and her new dog, Brucie, all of whom sound lovely.

Two-and-a-half years on, with ‘a new house in a new place, with new friends and a new dog, and the potential of a new relationship’, Lucie still hasn’t been able to bring herself to decide what to do with Mark’s ashes.

‘He is still in His ornate, lacquered box at the bottom of my wardrobe.’ But she writes: ‘I believe that Mark would want us to be happy.’
