It had women flocking to the High Street and won a string of female celebrity followers when it was launched in the UK last year.

But the makers of a best-selling anti-ageing drink, which promises to banish wrinkles in just four weeks, were unprepared for the effect the supplement was to have on their customers’ other halves.

After being inundated with requests from men, scientists have now developed a male version of the Pure Gold Collagen drink, which is due to go on sale at Boots later this month.

Called Active Gold Collagen, it has been specially formulated not only to target fine lines and skin ageing, but also to repair muscle damage and boost cartilage production following exercise, as well as reducing hair loss, they say.

Experts are sceptical over the benefits of collagen drinks, which they claim are no better than eating a healthy diet.

But despite this, customers bought Pure Gold Collagen, in their droves. It became the best-selling product on Boots website when it was launched last year and there is already a 7,000-stong waiting list for the men’s version.

Like the women’s supplement, the men’s drink comes in 50ml bottles containing a daily dose of collagen, along with acids designed to promote its production.

Reserves of collagen - the protein that gives skin strength and elasticity – deplete as the body gets older, causing skin to lose firmness and develop wrinkles.

Unlike the women’s drink, however, the men’s supplement also contains zinc, a nutrient which accelerates the renewal of skin cells and helps prevent hair loss and dandruff.

Active Gold has also been formulated to slow down the ‘internal’ ageing of muscles and joints.

It contains L-Carnitine, a nutrient which turns fat into energy and helps muscles recover after exercise, as well as glucosamine, a compound found in the body which helps in the repair of cartilage in joints and other body tissues that can slow with age.

Manufacturers Minerva Research Labs say Active Gold is 50 times more effective than collagen creams, which are applied onto the top layers of skin, because it is absorbed deep into the skin’s dermis via the blood stream.

In clinical trials on 1,500 men, aged 35 to 59, who drank the supplement daily, all said their skin appeared younger looking, with an average 26 per cent reduction in brow furrows in just 12 weeks.

Eight out of 10 subjects said their skin felt up to 26 per cent better hydrated within eight weeks, while all said there was a reduction in the appearance of deep wrinkles and their skin, hair and joints felt healthier.

Tony Sanguinetti, founder of Minerva Research Labs, said: ‘We were inundated with requests to formulate a liquid supplement for men that targets both internal ageing and external ageing and supports healthy hair, joints and muscles.

‘Active Gold Collagen allows quality active ingredients to work faster and collagen peptides to get into the blood stream and directly into the dermis.’

The women’s version of the drink has been endorsed by several celebrities.

TV presenter  Anthea Turner, 52, said it was ‘one of the most effective skincare products’ she had tried.

While presenter Carol Smillie, 50, claimed that, after taking the drink for a few weeks, ‘my skin looks and feels more youthful, radiant and hydrated’.

According to analysts Datamonitor, the global market in anti-ageing drinks is expected to rise to around £41.3 billion by 2014.

But experts say the benefits of such supplements are unproven.

Dr Sam Bunting, a cosmetic dermatologist, said: ‘I just haven’t seen any evidence that explains why taking collagen orally should improve the quantity of collagen in your skin.

‘The collagen in a drink is broken down in your stomach.

‘Replenishing collagen stores is a complex and finely tuned biological process.

'You can’t cheat by importing these molecules “whole” from the diet. It offers no advantage that I’m aware of over normal dietary protein.’

Consultant dermatologist Dr Nick Lowe added that the drinks were ‘interesting’, but said: ‘More research is needed before we can be sure if they result in facial rejuvenation.’
