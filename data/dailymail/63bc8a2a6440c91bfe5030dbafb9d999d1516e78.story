A British salesman pushed a naked prostitute from his Dubai hotel room window after they argued during sex about her fee, a court heard yesterday.

Zoubair Ali, 37, faces up to ten years behind bars if convicted.

Dubai Criminal Court heard how the vice girl fell 20ft from the first floor window and landed on the roof of a car.

Court, pictured, to answer sex, drink and assault allegations

The British worker allegedly pushed her after a drunken row over her £85 fee.

According to the Ukrainian prostitute she met Ali in a bar before returning to his luxury room.

But they began arguing over her £85 fee during sex in his private first-floor suite and she refused to continue until he paid more.

The sex worker - known only as A.K. - said she was then thrown from the bedroom's window and on to the roof of a car.

She ran to the reception and alerted hotel staff who contacted police.

Ali was then stopped by security staff trying to get into his car to flee the scene before officers arrived, the court heard.

The prostitute, 36, said: 'I went with him to his hotel room because I felt lonely and needed company. I was interested in continuing the evening with him,' she said in her witness statement, website Gulf News said.

'As soon as we walked into his room, we quarrelled… I ran to the bedroom and closed the door from inside. Then I opened the window and cried for help.'

It was then that she was allegedly pushed.

A worker at the hotel said that he heard a loud crash seconds before a naked woman ran into the hotel's reception.

Ali is charged with having sex while unmarried and assault, which he denies. He admitted drinking on unauthorised premises.

The prostitute is accused of prostitution and having unmarried sex.

She did not turn up at court for the hearing.

A British friend has claimed they met the prostitute in a bar and she offered a massage and sex in return for money.

Judge Mohammad Majid Mohammad adjourned the case until December 1. Ali was released on bail.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'We are aware of reports of the detention of a British national in Dubai.

'We are urgently looking into these reports so we can provide consular assistance if required.'

A court source added: 'This gentleman could be in serious trouble. He could get ten years if found guilty of assault, plus time for sex and drink offences.'
