A widow whose husband was killed courageously fighting a wildfire in Yarnell, Arizona five weeks ago is being denied the lifetime benefits she was counting on to raise the couple's four young children alone.

Juliann Ashcraft's husband, Andrew, was one of 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots firefighters who lost their lives when a fire they were battling suddenly changed direction and engulfed them.

Mr Ashcraft, like his colleagues, was protecting the people of Yarnell when he died, tragically leaving his young family without a husband, father or income. But the city of Prescott, where the Hotshots were based, is now claiming he was a seasonal worker, despite him working a 40 hour week year round, and denying Mrs Ashcraft full benefits.

Children: Mrs Ashcraft, pictured, was left to raise her four children alone

'As shocked as I was that my husband 
went to work and never came home, I'm equally shocked in how the city 
has treated our family since then,' Mrs Ashcraft, whose youngest child 
is just 18 months old, told CBS News.

All 19 Hotshot families will receive worker's compensation and a one-off federal payment of $328,000.

But
 the city is refusing to pay Mrs Ashcraft her husband's lifetime salary 
and health benefits, which together are worth millions, because it 
insists he was among 13 of the squad who were seasonal employees rather 
than full-timers.

Only six of the 19 firefighters are entitled to full-time benefits, the city claims.

'I
 said to them, "My husband was a full-time employee, he went to work 
full-time for you,"' she said, 'and their response to me was, "Perhaps 
there was a communication issue in your marriage."'

CBS
 News has seen paperwork showing Mr Ashcraft did infact earn a full-time
 salary as a firefighter for the city of Prescott. He was the only one 
of the 13 Hotshots denied full benefits who worked a 40 hour week 
through out the year.

Heartbreaking: Not only was Juliann Ashcraft, pictured, devastated to lose her husband, she is now facing raising their four children without the benefits she is entitled to

In a statement to CBS News, Prescott 
officials said the city had 'fully complied with all of the laws and 
employment polices that direct survivor benefits.'

But
 Mrs Ashcraft, still mourning the loss of her 29-year-old hero, is 
desperate for help, as the costs associated with bringing up four 
children mount.

'Quite 
literally, my bills are being paid by the good people of the world who 
are giving donations, because the city of Prescott isn't doing anything 
for us,' she told the TV station. 'Now I have four kids and myself, and I
 don't know what I'm going to do.

'I want to be able to just be mourning my husband, be supporting my children, be figuring out what our new normal is.'

The
 shocking treatment comes five weeks afterÂ the mother-of-four learned by
 watching the news that her firefighter husband had perished in the 
intense blaze that burned scores of homes to the ground.

Just days after the men's deaths, Mrs 
Ashcraft revealed the last conversation she had with her husband - and 
her fears when he never responded to her text messages.

Mrs 
Ashcraft sobbed as she recounted the bravery of her beloved husband and 
his close unit of highly-trained 'hotshot' colleagues, who were overcome
 by the ferocious flames in Yarnell.

She
 said she had been texting her husband throughout the day - with him 
telling her how much he loved and missed her, and how proud he was of 
their young children - until he abruptly stopped.

'I
 asked, "Will you be sleeping out there tonight?"' she told the Today 
show early last month as she struggled to hold back the tears. 'And of 
course there was no reply and they all laid out there that night.'

She
 added that she had been sending him pictures of their children swimming
 that day, and how his daughter had commented that she wished he was 
there to see the thunder storm with them.

He responded that he wished for that too. 'We could sure use some rain over here,' he said.

Mr
 Ashcraft also sent his wife a picture of their view of the smoke and 
flames from his team's lunch spot on Sunday, and Juliann said that she 
was not particularly concerned when she saw it.

The devastation has been described as a 'moonscape' after an inferno so intense that only the metal part of one chain saw was found

'It still did not look as catastrophic as it turned out to be,' she said. 'But he let us know that he loved us and missed us. Because of the dangers of the job, he would always tell us that he loved us.'

Family photographs reveal a picture 
perfect family as Juliann and Andrew are seen grinning and kissing, as 
well as laughing along with their four young children.

She told the Today show how, apart from his family, fighting fires with the Granite Mountain Hotshots was his life.

'He
 was the most amazing man,' she said. 'The best person I know. A 
contagious smile, a heart of gold. That's why he did what he did, 
because he want to protect the community where he lived.'

Of
 his team, she added: 'They loved what they did. These men lived 
together. They fought fires together. They died together - doing what 
they loved.'

On July 1, the day after the men were killed, Mrs Ashcraft was pictured distraught at a makeshift 
memorial in Prescott for the fallen firefighters. She said she 
learned of her husband's death while watching the news with their four children.

'They died heroes,' she told azcentral.com as she wept. 'And we'll miss them. We love them.'

Prescott
 High School physical education teacher and coach Lou Beneitone taught 
many of the Hotshots, and remembered Ashcraft as a fitness-oriented 
student.

'He had some 
athletic ability in him and he was a go-getter, too. You could pretty 
much see, from young freshman all the way, he was going to be physically
 active.'

Beneitone said 
athletic prowess was a must for the Hotshots. 'That's what it takes. You
 gotta be very physically fit, and you gotta like it, gotta like the 
hard work.'

Ashcraft, a 
member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was honored 
to be a member of the Hotshot crew, and 'he just had a really sweet 
spirit about him,' Elise Smith, a Prescott, Arizona, resident, told The 
Deseret News of Salt Lake City.

As the bodies of the 
Granite Mountain Hotshots were recovered, it emerged that the team's 
20th member survived as he was moving the crew's truck when the flames 
overcame his comrades.

Helicopters had been unable to reach the highly-trained men as they fought the flames in Yarnell and they could not be saved by their emergency shelters - tent-like structures meant to shield them from flames
 and heat.

When they were found on Sunday, all 19 
shelters were deployed but some of the men's bodies were inside their 
individual shelters, while others were outside - indicating just how 
suddenly they were overcome by the flames.

'It had to be a perfect storm in order 
for this to happen,' Prescott Fire Department spokesman Wade Ward told the Today show last month.

President Obama 
called the firefighters heroes and highly skilled professionals who 'put
 themselves in harm's way to protect the lives and property of fellow 
citizens they would never meet.'

The highly-skilled team was overtaken by a 
fast-moving blaze stoked by hot winds on Sunday.

The fire was sparked by a lightning strike on Friday and spread to at least 8,400 acres amid triple-digit temperatures, low humidity and 
windy conditions.

The fire has also destroyed an estimated 200 homes. Dry grass
 near the communities of Yarnell and Glen Isla fed the fast-moving 
blaze.

It
 was unclear exactly how the crew became trapped. Southwest incident 
team leader Clay Templin said the team and its commanders were following
 safety protocols, but it appears the fire's erratic nature simply 
overwhelmed them.

At the
 time, Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo said the 19 firefighters were a 
part of the city's fire department. With their deaths, the department 
lost 20 per cent of its members.

'We
 grieve for the family. We grieve for the department. We grieve for the 
city,' he said at a news conference on June 30. 'We're devastated. 
We just lost 19 of the finest people you'll ever meet.'

Hot shot crews are elite firefighters 
who often hike for miles into the wilderness with chain saws and 
backpacks filled with heavy gear to build lines of protection between 
people and fires.

They remove brush, trees and anything that might burn 
in the direction of homes and cities.

The crew killed in the blaze had been working on other wildfires in recent weeks in New Mexico and Arizona, Fraijo said.
