The U.S. Defense Department wanted five Americans released in exchange for five Taliban terrorists – not just the single American infantryman now accused of desertion – according to a senior congressional aide.

And with the Bowe Bergdahl hostage swap now nearly a week old, the State Department is still insisting that it doesn't offer 'concessions' to 'terrorists' or other 'hostage-takers'

Joe Kasper, chief of staff to House Armed Services Committee member Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, said late Thursday that the Pentagon aimed to free Caitlan Coleman of York, Pennsylvania and her baby who was born in captivity, along with her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle, as part of a 'broader goal.'

Also on America's wish list was Warren Weinstein, a Maryland man who was abducted in 2011 in Pakistan. A Taliban-aligned sect of al-Qaeda is still holding him captive.

The Pentagon 'was looking at this in the whole scope of things, to deal with these people as well,' Kasper told USA Today. 'Instead of five for one, why not five for five?'

DOUBLESPEAK: State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said Wednesday that 'our policy is not to make concessions to terrorists' -- just days after the Obama administration traded hostages with the Taliban

But the White House nixed the military's hoped-for deal, Kasper told USA Today, choosing instead to trade five Taliban for Bergdahl alone.

The State Department is drawing a firm distinction between negotiating for the release of Bergdahl, a U.S. Army infantryman, and the Hunter family, who were not in uniform.

Bergdahl's status 'as a missing or captured soldier,' State Department deputy spokesperson Marie Harf said, 'is distinct from someone who, for example, may be a civilian hostage.'

But in a blanket statement to reporters on Wednesday, she said that 'we don’t make concessions to terrorists.'

'So not making concessions does not preclude negotiating,' a reporter shot back. 'Is that what you’re saying?'

'This was an exchange of prisoners in war, ' Harf replied.

Another reporter in the room reminded her that 'every administration' since the Guantanamo Bay detention camp opened, have parsed it out ad nauseum that these are not prisoners, these are detainees.'

'Right,' Harf replied.

'You’ve changed your language today and called them prisoners in war,' the astonished reporter said.

Journalists challenged Harf, saying the 5-forf-1 Taliban trade 'legitimizes the Taliban to take prisoners of war' -- and accused her of suddenly changign her language to call Guantanamo Bay detainees 'prisoners in war'

Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Sen. Dianne Feinstein believes that if the White House had followed federal law and given Congress 30 days to consider a Guantanamo detainee release, more Americans might have been rescied

Harf argued a hypothetical situation: 'Let's say it was important for us to get Sgt. Bergdahl home,' she said. 'Let's say these guys may have eventually been transferred somewhere anyways. I think many of us would make the argument – I would make it – that we should get something for them.'

She doubled down a day later, cryptically telling USA Today on Thursday that America has a 'longstanding U.S. policy not to make concessions to hostage-takers.'

Rep Hunter wrote to President Barack Obama on Monday, saying that the Pentagon's broader plan for a wider hostage release never had time to mature while the State Department's negotiations rushed ahead.

Hunter, a Marine Corps reservist who himself served in Iraq and Afghanistan, also suggested that the Defense Department might have won Bergdahl's release without releasing terrorists at all.

He complained to Obama about 'the sudden urgency behind the prisoner swap given other lines of effort offered the same opportunity for success.'

'These efforts should have been fully exhausted before any commitment to exchange prisoners was made,' Hunter wrote.'Now a situation has been created whereby prisoner exchanges — specifically disproportionate exchanges — are viewed by the Taliban and other aligned forces as achievable.'

Also needs rescue: Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, a decorated Marine, has been held in a Mexican prison for two months for taking a wrong turn and entering the country with registered weapons

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Bloomberg Television on Friday that if Congress had 30 days' notice on Guantanamo Bay detainee releases – as federal law requires – Members could have argued for the release of more Americans.

'There are two others in Afghanistan,' Feinstein said, according to an advance transcript obtained by MailOnline. 'One is a young couple with a baby. ... I think they certainly ought to be part of any swap.'

'If there were some consultation, that could have been suggested, to get two Americans out ... But there was no opportunity to do so,' Feinstein added.

'And that’s the 30 days, that you have an opportunity, if there are issues you want to raise or thoughts that might be helpful, actual, to the administration. Nobody knows everything.'

Her interview will air Friday night.
