One of China's leading film directors is being investigated for allegedly fathering seven children, violating the country's strict policy of one child per family.

Zhang Yimou, who directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is said to be facing a 160million yuan fine (£17million) for having children from his two marriages and two further relationships.

Online reports of the breach this week have led to the authorities investigating the filmmaker, who directed the 2011 film The Flowers of War, starring Christian Bale.

'We are trying to confirm the online 
rumors,' said a woman at Wuxi city's family 
planning committee, a department under the municipal government in eastern Jiangsu province.

The woman, who would not be named, said she couldn't reveal any other information until 
authorities had finished investigating.

Social media users in China criticised
Zhang and drew distinctions between how the ruling Communist Party 
treats the elite and ordinary people.

'However many children a person has is
 their basic right, but in a twisted society, basic rights have become a
 privilege,' Beijing resident Liu Weiling, who works for a media 
company, wrote on Sina Weibo.

'Why is China unable to win the world's respect?' asked author Christopher Jing.

'Rich people with groups of mistresses, old celebrities changing wives, Zhang Yimou getting so many privileges.

Zhang masterminded the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which began with spectacular fireworks over the Bird's Nest stadium

'Four women and seven kids, if this 
was an ordinary person they would have killed you or fined you an 
unreasonable amount of money, but he is fine ... he is no better than 
ordinary people, such an unfair world will never gain respect.'

Zhang's film credits also include A 
Simple Noodle Story, an adaptation of the Coen brothers' 1984 movie 
Blood Simple, and Under the Hawthorn Tree, a love story set in China's 
decade-long, ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution.

His film Ju Dou was the first film from mainland China to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language movie in 1990.

Zhang's Los Angeles-based agent has not responded to requests for comment.

Earlier today, the website of the People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, said Zhang's second wife, former actress Chen Ting, was from Wuxi.

China's one-child policy applies to most urban couples. Rural families are allowed two children if their first-born is a girl.

The government introduced the policy in 1979 as a temporary measure to curb a surging population, but it is still in place despite being reviled by many citizens.
