David Moyes stepped up his quest for summer signings by flying to Lisbon to make a personal check on at least three top transfer targets.

Knowing he will be armed with a massive budget for team strengthening at the end of the season, the Manchester United manager attended Porto’s Portugal Cup semi-final with Benfica at the Estadio da Luz, in an attempt to narrow down a long list of candidates to bolster his side in all areas.

Sportsmail understands the two players under closest review were highly-rated centre-back Eliaquim Mangala and his Porto team-mate Jackson Martinez. In addition, Moyes has also been alerted to the form of Benfica’s on-loan left-back Guilherme Siqueira and was keen to see him in action.

Mindful that Mangala is also being seriously considered by Manchester City, as Manuel Pellegrini looks to bring in a suitable defensive partner for skipper Vincent Kompany, Moyes seized the opportunity to run the rule over the lynchpin of Porto’s back four before deciding whether to follow up his interest with a bid.

He is evidently reluctant to meet the central defender’s £37.8million buy-out clause but may take the chance to sound out Porto officials to see if there is room for manoeuvre.

Top target: United are chasing the signature of Luke Shaw - and will tempt Southampton with a £30m offer

Colombia marksman Martinez has established himself as one of the Portuguese League’s most prolific finishers, to such a degree that he has attracted the attention of Roma, Arsenal and Chelsea, as well as United, in recent weeks.

Moyes has long been linked with Real Madrid left-back Fabio Coentrao and is closing in on Southampton’s Luke Shaw, as revealed in Sportsmail. But as a contingency plan, he is keeping an eye on the form of Siqueira, who is on loan at Benfica from Granada.
