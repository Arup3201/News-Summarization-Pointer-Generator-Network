The pilot of the single-seat F-15C was with the 104th Fighter Wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard in Westfield.

Major Matthew Mutti from Barnes Air National Guard Base said that the jet had no munition onboard.

The jet was flying to New Orleans naval station according to NBC, to get a radar system, but the pilot's name has not been released.

According to officials, the pilot made a report of an inflight emergency, then lost radio contact whilst out on a standard training exercise to receive a system upgrade.

Col James Keefe, 104th Fighter Wing Commander, said: ‘Information on this incident is developing rapidly, and we are not going to speculate on what occurred or the status of the pilot.

‘We are hopeful that the pilot is OK, and the pilot will be in our thoughts and prayers.
