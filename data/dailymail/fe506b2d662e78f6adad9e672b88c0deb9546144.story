A Victoria train carriage that spent more than half a century as a cricket pavilion has returned to the tracks after nearly 80 years.

The first-class carriage was built in 1886 and used at a Somerset coal mine before being adopted by a cricket club.

After moving to a recreation ground in Templecombe, Somerset, the coach spent more than 50 years standing on the side of the pitch. It was one of two train carriages used by the club as changing rooms for players.

The Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust recognised the historical significance of the carriage, which was built in 1886 and used by a coal mine

But, in 1986, 100 years after it was built, the cricket club announced plans to get rid of the carriage to make way for new facilities.

George Judd, who was living in the area, offered to take it to Washford, Somerset, where a team of volunteers for the Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust (SDRT) got to work restoring it.

One of two carriages used at the cricket club, Mr Judd, now 75, recognised the historical importance of the carriage, and felt it should be rescued.

Mr Judd, one of the founding members of the SDRT, said if the trust hadn’t stepped in the carriage may have been burned.

Just less than 30 years on, with three help of between 30 and 40 volunteers, the work is done and the train made its debut at the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway gala.

Mike Beale, 64, who has been involved in the SDRT since the 1970s, said the train carriage will be used for similar events in the future.

The next job for volunteers from the trust, he said, is to complete the refurbishment of the inside of the carriage.

Estimating it will take another couple of years to complete, he said: 'It's a first-class coach so it's going to be quite a job.'

Mr Beale said the trust is also working on two other carriages but may need more funding after it cost £5,000 over the last two or three years to finish this carriage.

The former cricket pavilion has now completed its transformation back into a train carriage after 27 years

Trust chairman Godfrey Baker paid tribute to the many volunteers involved in the project

He said: 'It has been a long haul and during those many years many people have helped with the project.
