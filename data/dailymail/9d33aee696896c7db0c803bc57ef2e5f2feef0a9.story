A man who stole part of the Porsche that Fast and the Furious actor Paul Walker died in has been sentenced to six months in jail.

The Los Angeles County district attorney's office says 26-year-old Anthony Janow was sentenced Tuesday in Southern California.

Walker and driver Roger Rodas died on November 30 2013 when their speeding $400,000 Porsche Carrera GT hit a tree and a light pole in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita.

Doing time: The Los Angeles County district attorney's office says 26-year-old Anthony Janow was sentenced Tuesday in Southern California for stealing part of the Porsche that  actor Paul Walker died in

Prosecutors say Janow and his friend, 19-year-old James Witty, stole a roof panel when a tow truck carrying the wreckage stopped at a red light.

Witty was caught on video stealing the T-top roof of the Porsche right off the tow truck and he even bragged about the heist by posting photos on Instagram and Twitter.

He captioned images of the stolen wreckage: 'Piece of Paul Walker's car, took it off a tow truck at a stop light.'

The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft when he spotted what was going.

Caught red-handed: Prosecutors say Janow and his friend,  James Witty, stole a roof panel when a tow truck carrying the wreckage stopped at a red light - they later posted pictures to Twitter and Instagram

A search warrant was executed  and police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof.

Witty was arrested on the spot. 

The teenager later took to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intentions for the piece I took off the tow truck were to make a memorial out of it. 

'Paul was a childhood idol to me and many.

'At the time I was not thinking about the consequences it could have, I never wanted it to be like this I wasn't going to sell the piece to make a profit. Nobody in this world is perfect, we all make mistakes,' he wrote.

Screen star: Walker's final film Furious 7 is scheduled to be released on April 3, 2015 

'Some bigger than others. My deepest apologies go to Paul's family. And I'm going to say with confidence that I messed up big time, but continue on with life as should you all.' 

Witty and Janow each pleaded no contest to grand theft, destroying evidence and obstructing a peace officer.

Witty was sentenced earlier this year to six months in jail.
