'Sick': Commenting on the auction website's Facebook page, disgusted Jana Bodinkova said it made her 'sick', adding, 'My granddad would cry if he saw this'

But the decorations have caused fury both online and across the Czech Republic which was annexed by Hitler in 1938 and not liberated until the end of the war.

Commenting on the auction website's Facebook page, disgusted Jana Bodinkova said: 'It makes me sick.

'My granddad would cry if he saw this.

'It is incredible that we have something like this here now.'

Vaclav Ceska, 59, from the capital Prague said: 'This is is absolutely disgraceful.

'My grandparents fought in the resistance against the Nazis and remember the atrocities committed by the SS.

The owner of the baubles claimed he was 'not a member of any movement aimed at suppressing human rights and freedoms or the movement which support national, racial or class hatred to other group of people'

'The SS could sit around and have fun at Christmas with their pretty baubles while thousands were being tortured and murdered by them.

'These disgusting decorations should be destroyed, not preserved.'

Jozsef Helmeczy commenting on Facebook posted: 'Are you kidding me? I would forbid it.'

The owner of the baubles wrote: 'I declare that I am not a member of any movement aimed at suppressing human rights and freedoms or the movement which support national, racial or class hatred to other group of people.

'I don't support movements like the SS either.'
