It all happens so fast that in the blink-and-miss-it moment driver Marcello Marateotto loses control of his car and crashes in spectacular fashion.

Marateotto blew a tyre at the middle of a mid-corner curve (Eau Rouge) and lost control of his car, which caused it to fly through the air and towards spectators.

But luckily everyone walked away unharmed from the shocking crash. The driver was taken to the hospital for observation and released the next day.

The moment the driver loses control of the car. Spectators are still unaware of how close to danger they are

The car bounces and rolls making a 180 degree turn as parts of the body fly off into the air.

The vehicle gains momentum and hurtles through the barriers, before making a few frightening rolls and crashing into the tyre wall.

The car looks as if it’s about to hit the spectators who instinctively move out of the way.

Debris flies through the air in the dramatic moment.

But instead it bounces off the grass bank and the momentum causes it to smash its way towards the marshal post where the marshal, who is holding a clipboard, has a narrow escape from what could have been a very nasty accident.
