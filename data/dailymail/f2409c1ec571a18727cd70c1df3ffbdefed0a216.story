Murdered mother Allison Baden-Clay wrote a secret letter to her husband Gerard in the days after she found out about his affair saying that what he had with his mistress was just a 'boy's fantasy'.

The letter was found on Allison's computer as police investigated her disappearance in April 2012 but it wasn't shown in court during the 21-day trial that led to Gerard Baden-Clay being sentenced to life in prison for his wife's murder.

Allison's letter, obtained by Channel 7's Sunday Night, revealed she felt 'bitter' over her husband's three-year affair with Toni McHugh, a colleague at his Brisbane real estate business, but she was prepared to put the affair behind them.

'What you had with her was not real. It was a boy's fantasy with an adrenalin rush every time you were sneaking about,' the letter read, according to the program.

'You were never with her when she had broken sleep for years on end as her children were little and she was breast feeding. You only used her breasts for other f***ing reasons.

'You only saw her when she washed her hair, shaved her bikini line, put her good undies on and was ready for her lover. That makes me bitter.'

The mother of three said in the letter the length of the affair was what had hurt most and the fact Baden-Clay didn't have the courage to end it sooner.

'At the depth of deceit I shake my head in complete disbelief as to how you could have thought up so many excuses and told so many lies,' it read.

The letter was found on Allison's computer as police investigated her disappearance in April 2012 and detailed what Baden-Clay could do to try and reconcile their marriage

But Allison also wrote of what her husband could do moving forward in a bid to reconcile their marriage, including date nights, flower deliveries and weekends away.

'This is not meant to be a put Gerard down list, neither is it a poor me letter,' the letter read.

'My aim is to start the new year with a fresh start and no longer talk about the affair except in counselling so I wanted to get as much off my chest as I could.'

Her list included: one date night, a bunch of flowers and lunch together each week, a Saturday off every month and four weekend trips away every year.

Her decomposed body was found lying in a creek 13km away from the family home in Brookfield, Brisbane, in April 2012. 

'Where she ended up was not where she deserved to be found,' Allison's friend Linda Ebeling told Sunday Night.

Allison's friend Linda Ebeling told the program she had spoken to Baden-Clay at Allison's funeral saying she would give anything for just one more hug

The morning after he killed his wife and dumped her body by the creek, a calm Baden-Clay called 000 at 7.15am to report his wife as missing.

As he was questioned by police, Baden-Clay said two scratches he had on his face were from shaving and that the scratches on his body came from a caterpillar.

'I’m so proud of her that she scratched his face... that’s not the Allison I know, to fight,' Allison's cousin Jodie Dann said.

'She was fighting for her life and for her girls. If she hadn’t have done that we would never have been able to keep those girls safe.'

Jodie Dann, her cousin, said she was proud Allison had scratched Baden-Clay's face because it helped put him behind bars and protect the couple's three children
