Kim Jong-il's former bodyguard, who protected him during the 1980s, believes that the former dictator's son Kim Jong-un is far more dangerous that the departed 'Dear Leader'.  

Lee Young-Guk was chosen to protect Kim in 1979, while his father Kim Il Sung still ruled North Korea.

Lee said he had to train fanatically to become an elite bodyguard, including having the ability to smash roof tiles with his fists, using martial arts techniques.

He said the Kims required absolute loyalty and any suspicion of treachery would be dealt with incredibly harshly. 

Speaking to CNN, Lee admitted that he was brainwashed by the regime while he was still working for Kim Jong-Un's father during the 1980s. 

He said: 'When Kim Jong Il would arrive in his vehicle, advisors would run away and throw themselves onto the grass. They had dust on their clothes but they wanted to hide from him.

'They are scared because even when he was happy he would be rude and could chop off their heads.'

One advisor who used Kim's private elevator and ashtray was deported to a concentration camp where he died. 

However, Lee said the North Korean people have more reason to be afraid of Kim Jong-Un than his father. 

'Kim Jong Un ended up killing his uncle, who even Kim Jong Il could not kill. As power was handed down to the third generation, it became crueler. Kim Jong Un has created loyalty, but it is fake and based on fear.'

Lee ceased working for Kim when one of the bodyguard's relations became a driver for the dictator. Only one family member was allowed to work for the Kim's according to their paranoid rules. 

Upon returning to his home near the China border, Lee was despondent when he saw the state the country was still in and tried to escape. 

He was captured and sent to a concentration camp but was able to escape and moved to South Korea where he became a duck farmer. 

He has also written a book on his experiences working for Kim Jong-Il.

The family have become infamous for their extreme examples of exacting revenge for any perceived offence. 

Jang Song-thaek was executed in December 2013 after he was accused to treason against the North Korean regime. 

Jang was one of the most powerful men in North Korea and was seen as hugely important in the transition of power between Kim Jong-Il and his son. 

Following his execution, Kim described his uncle as 'factionalist filth'. 

One of Jang's supporters O Sang-hon was 'executed by flame-thrower' according to North Korean officials.  

After Kim Jong-Il's death in 2012, people who were deemed not to have mourned intensely enough, were sent to a labour camp for six months.

In October 2013, it was reported that Kim Jong-Un ordered the execution of his ex-girlfriend Hyon Song-Wol, who had a popular hit song in North Korea. 

However, she appeared on North Korean state television in May delivering a speech. 

Days after she reappeared in public, Kim ordered the execution of engineers and architects involved in the construction of a Pyongyang tower block which collapsed days earlier. 

More than 500 people died in the collapse which was blamed on 'shoddy workmanship'. Kim ordered the executions because he was 'unable to sleep after learning of the tragedy'. 

Kim himself went missing from public view in early September, prompting claims that he may have been overthrown. 

However, it is understood he underwent ankle surgery and reappeared in public after six weeks carrying a black cane. 

Upon his return, it is believed he ordered the execution of six senior officials.
