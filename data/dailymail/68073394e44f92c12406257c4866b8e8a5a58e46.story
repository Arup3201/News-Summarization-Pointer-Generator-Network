Pina Coladas might not sound like an obvious choice of diet drink but it seems they could be the weight-loss answer we've all been looking for.

The Pina Colada diet combines a menu of tropical fruit with healthy protein shakes, weight-loss supplements and regular workouts and claims to result in a new bikini body in just four weeks.

Sound too good to be true? FEMAIL put it to the test.

DENI SAYS: 'I
 had piled on a few pounds over Christmas and, at just 5ft 4in, it was 
noticeable, so I decided to see whether the Pina Colada diet could make a difference.

Despite its name, the diet allows no alcohol. The Pina Colada moniker comes from the cocktail flavoured protein shakes that I drank five times a week, and from all the mango, papaya and pineapple I ate.

The concept behind the plan is to get in the holiday spirit by eating the same healthy 
things you might while sunning yourself abroad, thus inspiring you to 
get your bikini body back.

You start each day with melt water - regular tap water which has been put in the freezer and then melted again.

This, say the brains behind the diet, is crucial because the freezing and thawing process removes salts and other harmful material while retaining essential minerals such as calcium, magnesium and natrium.

Later, you get to tuck into a meal plan that focuses heavily on vitamin C and is complemented by Garcinia Cambogia tablets, thought by some to help with weightloss, and meal replacement Skinny Shakes.

A typical breakfast would be poached or boiled eggs with steamed spinach and/or broccoli, or some fresh blueberries and Greek yoghurt and nuts.

On a non-shake day, lunch would feature a stir fry or perhaps celery, beetroot and veggies with a turkey breast.

I'd end the day with butternut squash, courgette and lean fish for dinner. While
 trans fats were all but banned, healthy ones were allowed. I would cook with walnut oil and drizzle some extra virgin olive oil over salads.

The secret ingredients in the diet 
are the Re:Active Pina Colada flavour Skinny Shake and the Re:Active 
Garcinia Cambogia pills.

The pills contain extracts from the Indonesian garcinia gambogia fruit, which looks like a small pumpkin and is used in curries and chutneys. Its 'magic' component is hydroxycitric acid (HCA).

HCA has been found to suppress the appetite, inhibit fat production and increase energy levels - without the negative side effects of caffeine. Another key benefit is its capacity to boost levels of serotonin, relieving stress and low moods which often prompt us to binge eat.

With the 'shake and take' drinks, each bottle contains a small amount of powder, to which water is added to produce a reasonably tasty 234-calorie shake.

But shedding the pounds isn't just about eating well and so I met trainer Jack from Urban Energie at PureGym in London once a week for a 45-minute workout and weigh-in to keep track of my progress - and to keep me on the straight and narrow!

We worked with weights, kettlebells, TRX and steps to build strength, tone up and burn fat. He took my measurements and kept an eye on my eating habits with MyFitnessPal.

We built my strength up and I am now able to do 30 full press ups in a workout - before I couldn't even manage one.

I'm absolutely thrilled with losing 10lbs in just four weeks, taking me down from 10st 7bs to 9st 11lbs. I feel like some weight has come off evenly, all over, and I'm so much more toned.

My waistline slimmed from 29.5in to 27.5in, and my hips from 40in to 38in. I'm even fitting into some size 8 clothes, which is nothing short of a miracle.

Despite the protein shakes and pills, it didn't feel like I was on a 'diet' - it wasn't torturous and I didn't feel deprived.

A week after finishing the diet, I'm still hitting the gym regularly and I've learned to love healthy eating, although I'm glad I'm off the shakes and that no-one's keeping an eye on my chocolate intake anymore!
