A 21-year-old minor league baseball player with the Cincinnati Reds has been charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct after allegedly throwing a rock at his girlfriend's head and knocking her out, police say.

The incident occurred outside a restaurant in Glendale, Arizona, early on Saturday.

Tanner Jeremy Rahier, a third-baseman for the Class A Dayton Dragons in 2014, is said to have refused to pay his tab at Pullano's Pizza and started to argue with the bartender just after midnight.

Police say Rahier was intoxicated, and was led outside by his girlfriend, however he started throwing rocks as the two argued in the parking lot, according to AZ Family.

Scene: Police say the incident occurred at Pullano's Pizza in Goodyear, and that an intoxicated Rahier refused to pay his tab at the restaurant

One of the rocks - about 8-inches in diameter, police say - hit the woman in the left side of her head.

The rock caused a deep cut and knocked the woman unconscious.

Rahier then ran from the scene, but police found and arrested him nearby. 

The woman - who has not been identified - told police she had been dating Rahier for about a month.

However Rahier denied throwing any rocks  and said he does not know the woman, according to police.

The woman was taken to hospital and may need stitches for the cut to her head.

Rahier, originally from California, had previously been arrested in Oklahoma for public intoxication, according to AZ Central.

Rahier was a second-round pick for the Reds in the 2012 Draft out of Palm Desert High School in California, according to MLB.com.

He has appeared in 274 Minor League games over three seasons.

He was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. 

The Reds are currently in spring training and their facilities are nearby in Goodyear.
