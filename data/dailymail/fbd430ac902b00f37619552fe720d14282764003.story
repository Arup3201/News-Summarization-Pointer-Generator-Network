An 18-year-old is fighting for the custody of her younger siblings after both their parents died suddenly within three years of each other.

MacKenzie Jackson's mother Rebecca was killed by a heart attack in 2012. On January 4 this year, her father Cory died unexpectedly.

Her brother Spencer, 14, and sister Meagan, 16, have automatically been placed in foster care by the local authority at Cass County in West Fargo, North Dakota.

'I feel like my brother and sister need me because I'm really the closest thing that they have left of my mom and dad,' MacKenzie told WDAY.com.

'We're are strong because we have each other to lean on, we are the three peas in a pod.'

MacKenzie is in talks with Cass County to arrange a court date and has taken a job as a beautician, while her friends start freshman year at West Fargo High School.  

This week she moved into her own three-bedroom apartment after raising money to leave the family home where she found both her parents dead.

'The only reason I knew [my dad] was dead is because it was the same way I found my mom,' MacKenzie explained to Valley News Live.

Tragic: Rebecca Jackson passed away from a heart attack in 2012. Cory Jackson died suddenly on January 4

Difficult to move on: MacKenzie was the one that found her mother dead, then three years later her father

'The same way he felt, and it was really weird cause they both passed away in same bedroom, their bed.

'It was kind of hard for us to walk past the bedroom knowing that they're not going to be there.'

Meanwhile, the community is calling for donations to help the siblings start building a new life.

'It's going to be harder now just by myself, but I think I can do it.

'We need each other': MacKenzie said her brother Spencer wants to be able to have dinner as a family

Ready to support them: MacKenzie has taken a job as a beautician and is ready to look after her siblings

'I grew up a lot faster than I should have, dealing with my mom and dad's past dealing with alcohol or drugs. So I always have been doing things on my own, and so have Meagan and Spencer.

'Spencer is really excited about sitting at the table and eating, and having family nights, I guess being a family.'
