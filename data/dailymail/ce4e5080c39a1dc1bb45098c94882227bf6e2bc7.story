Tim Sherwood has branded the obsession with the way in which managers carry themselves as 'nonsense' and claims some only continue to get hired because of the way they project themselves.

The 45-year-old was sacked as Tottenham manager at the end of last season despite enjoying a modicum of success at White Hart Lane.

Many believe that decision was down to his touchline demeanour and outspoken nature in the press, but Sherwood stands by his style.

Paying the price for enthusiasm? The 45-year-old was sacked by chairman Daniel Levy at White Hart Lane

'I don't care about perception,' the former Blackburn midfielder wrote in his Independent column. 'My reactions on the touchline were emotionally honest.

'When you are out there on your own you go through massive highs and lows. I don't think it is wrong to show your emotions.

'But it is something that is picked up on by people in football. And there are some managers who use it to their advantage. They project an image. There are a lot of actors out there.'

Two men who can't be accused of any calculated emotion are Miguel Herrera and Jorge Sampaoli. The Mexico and Chile bosses have been real characters at this summer's World Cup and have lived every moment of their sides' tournament thus far.

The pair go into this weekend with real chances of upsetting the apple cart; Chile play Brazil on Saturday with Holland waiting for the Mexicans.

And the energy given off by their respective bosses is something Sherwood has admired.

'I like Mexico's coach Miguel Herrera. He is there in the moment,' he said. 'There is nothing forced about him. So too Jorge Sampaoli. He prowls around that technical area with intensity. He doesn't spend any time checking how he looks on the stadium screens.

'As a football person, I like that.' 

He added: 'I have spoken to a few people in football since I left Spurs. Many of them have told me that If I had kept my mouth shut on certain issues I might still be manager.

There are some people at football clubs who think that the demeanour of a manager, what he says to the press and the television after the match, is more important than how he prepares his team. It's a nonsense.'
