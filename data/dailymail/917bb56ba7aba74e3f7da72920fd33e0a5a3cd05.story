Prison romp: Nurse Jane Jackson was caught in a tryst with a dangerous prisoner in her treatment room

A prison nurse was found semi-naked in her treatment room with a dangerous inmate, a misconduct hearing was told yesterday.

Jane Jackson wedged the door closed with a mop during the liaison at a high-security jail dubbed ‘Britain’s Alcatraz’.

When a colleague burst in, the 35-year-old was hiding behind the door stripped to the waist clutching her bra and top, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told.

Jackson is accused of having ‘sexually motivated’ meetings with the man, referred to as prisoner A, in January and February 2009. At the time, she was employed by Milton Keynes Primary Care Trust as a staff nurse based at HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire.

She is also said to have smuggled in toiletries for her lover, and to have left her prison keys unattended and a medication cupboard open in his presence.

Barry Dooley, for the NMC, said: ‘She said she regretted her actions and was in a vulnerable state of mind at the time. She knew prisoner A had strong feelings for her, and deep down knew he was a prisoner, she was an officer, and what she was doing was wrong.

‘It is a category A prison for the highest level of offences, including rape, murder and terrorism,’ said Mr Dooley. ‘These are highly dangerous offenders.’

On February 7, 2009, Jackson was reported to her colleague Rebecca Langley for being in the treatment room alone with prisoner A, in breach of strict regulations.

‘The door was closed, and Miss Langley tried to open the door but could not,’ said Mr Dooley. ‘She felt the door was locked by an item on the inside. She continued to call out and after ten to 15 seconds the door opened from the inside.’

Miss Langley saw prisoner A sat on the treatment bed in shorts and a T-shirt, Mr Dooley said, and Jackson was cowering behind the door. ‘Her top half was naked, and she was holding her bra and tunic in her hand’, he said, adding: ‘Miss Langley asked how she had locked the door, and the [nurse] replied that this is how we always do it, by wedging the mop against the door.’

High security: The incident occurred at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, which has been dubbed 'Britain's Alcatraz'

Jackson was accused of putting the security of the prison at risk by allegedly unclipping her belt – which held her prison keys – while locked in the treatment room. She was immediately sent to a manager to explain herself and was suspended that day. Following an investigation, she was sacked by the health trust on July 9, 2009.

Yesterday’s fitness-to-practise hearing, in London, was told Jackson has admitted being caught half-dressed with prisoner A, but will argue she was not completely topless.

She has also confessed to bringing unauthorised toiletries into the prison, embracing prisoner A, and unclipping her prison keys during the treatment room liaison.

However, she denies further trysts with prisoner A, and rejects allegations her conduct was sexually motivated or that she left the medication cupboard unlocked. She also denies her fitness to continue as a nurse has been impaired.

The hearing continues.
