London's property market is a fluid beast, but a few of the capital's streets are so sought after that houses in them hardly ever come on the market.

Nestled in a quiet corner of Chelsea, The Boltons is one such street, but if you're a multi-millionaire with your eye on the SW10 postcode, now's your chance.

An 18-bedroom mansion, which comes complete with a separate five-bedroom mews house (handy for the staff), has just gone on the market there for £39,500,000.

Properties in The Boltons in London's Chelsea don't come on the market very often, so this 18-bedroom house, for sale at £38,500,000, will probably be snapped up

Room for entertaining: The enormous drawing room boasts views over the manicured garden, beyond which is the five-bedroom mews house, included in the price

Some back garden: At the back of the house is a large balustraded terrace, with steps leading down onto the well-kept lawn and the separate mews house

Impressive entrance hall: The house lies in The Boltons, the second most expensive street (average house price £23.4m) in Britain after Kensington Park Gardens (£36m)

The house covers nearly 10,000sq ft, making it one of London's largest, and is built on the site of Coleherne House, home to renowned racehorse auctioneer, Edmund Tattersall, in the 19th century.

The main house has nine ensuite bedrooms, plus four more bedrooms, and a lift, while the mews house at the end of the perfectly manicured garden has a further five bedrooms.

As well as an impressive drawing room and terrace overlooking the garden, which can accommodate 60 guests, the house has not one but two laundry rooms, a silver room where the staff can keep the candlesticks gleaming, and a grand entrance hall with sweeping stone staircase and gilt cornicing.

At 2,500sq ft, the mews house is bigger than most family houses in London, and boasts its own drawing room, three bathrooms, and a large garage.

Jake Russell, of estate agent Russell Simpson, said: 'This property is the perfect Chelsea home, offering the homebuyer a large mansion in west London.

'Perfect for social events and family gatherings, there are enough bedrooms to accommodate a large family, friends and guests.  Close to Knightsbridge and the West End, residents can be at Harrods in eight minutes and shopping on the King’s Road within four minutes.'

The buyer will need even deeper pockets than the price tag suggests, as the stamp duty alone will cost them £2.75million. 

The Boltons, whose previous residents include Madonna and actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr, is part of an expensive enclave of streets that are home to bankers and oil billionaires as well as the odd footballer - Chelsea's Frank Lampard is close by. 

The last house sale listed in the street by Zoopla was in 2012, and judging by the sale price of £54, 959,000, whoever snaps this one up might be getting themselves a bargain. 

Dinner time: The elegant wooden-panelled dining room has full-length windows over the garden, air conditioning, and can easily seat 14 for dinner

Make a statement: No money has been spared in the decorating of this house, which boasts ornately wrought iron bannisters, gilt cornicing and a marble-lined hall floor

The house lies in an exclusive but quiet enclave on the South Kensington/Chelsea border, home to oil billionaires and footballers, but be ready for the £2.75m stamp duty

The house, which lies on the site of the old Coleherne House, boasts not only a silver room where the staff may polish candlesticks, but two laundry rooms and a garage
