A former mixed martial arts fighter was finally captured after a tense standoff with members of the LAPD SWAT team.

Jason 'Mayhem' Miller ran into his Mission Viejo, California, home earlier today after sheriff's deputies appeared to arrest him on warrants in connection with domestic violence and stalking allegations, barricading himself on the premises.

This led to a SWAT team being called in, and a three hour long standoff.

Members of the team eventually broke through the door, handcuffing Miller and leading him away sometime around 2 pm this afternoon.

Miller, 33, live tweeted the entire standoff. 

In addition to discussing the money being wasted by the number of SWAT members present - this even though he refused to come out - he also stated he felt that these people were trying to 'murder' him.

He also reflected on the state of the justice system in America, writing in one tweet, 'I did nothing wrong. This is the state of American Justice. I feel you black men. They fear, so they threaten to take our lives. Abhorrent.'

The Los Angeles Times reports there are three warrants for Miller’s arrest, for suspicion of domestic violence, criminal contempt, and stalking.

Based on statements made on his Twitter today, it would seem that Miller was due in court this morning and missed his appearance.

Miller was also arrested back in 2012 on suspicion of burglary after he was found naked and sleeping on a couch at the Mission Viejo Mission Hills Church.

He was ultimately charged with misdemeanor vandalism.

In addition to his fighting career, Miller was also a host on the short-lived MTV show Bully Beatdown.

Although he announced he was returning to MMA in October of last year, his last fight took place in early 2012.
