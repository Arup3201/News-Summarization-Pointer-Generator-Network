Recent storms may have caused the roof of a privately-run Texas prison to collapse Saturday and injure  20 inmates, authorities say.

Diboll Correctional Center, owned by Management & Training Corp, is about 100 miles northeast of Houston. One of the injured was airlifted to the large city after the collapse, an additional 10 were transported to local hospitals by ambulance.

The airlifted inmate is in critical condition, according to the Lufkin Daily News, which added the facility houses low to medium-security inmates.

'It probably had a lot to do with the rain over the last couple days,' warden David Driscoll told WGHP.

The remaining injured inmates suffered cuts and bruises when wallboard fell from the ceiling of a housing area at the prison about 11.30 a.m., a prison spokesperson said in a statement.

MTC spokesperson Issa Arnita said 86 inmates were in the area when the ceiling material fell. He said officials are trying to determine the cause.

'We got a lot of rain yesterday. It’s a new building, a new facility. I don’t know why the roof would collapse,' Lufkin Fire Department Battalion Chief Jesse Moody told the station.

Diboll has received over six inches of rain in the alst five days, according to the Weather Underground. An MTC spokesperson said the prison opened in June 1995.

The 518-bed minimum-security facility is operated by Centerville, Utah-based MTC. The company operates 22 prisons across eight states, with the majority in Texas and Mississippi, according to its website.
