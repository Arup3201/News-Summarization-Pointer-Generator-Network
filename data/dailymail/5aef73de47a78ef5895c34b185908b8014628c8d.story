A search is underway for a 14-year-old girl who went missing 23 years ago, authorities said.

Melanie Melanson vanished in October 1989 after going to a party in the woods with friends near a Kraft Foods plant in Woburn, Massachusetts.

Although police initially thought she had run away, it was later believed that she had been killed. The girl's body has never been found and no suspects ever named.

The missing girl's family were at the 
scene on Wednesday while a dig took place and a police helicopter flew 
over head taking pictures of the area.

Looking for answers: There was a renewed search today for Melanie Melanson who went missing 23 years ago in Massachusetts

Private investigator Michael Garrigan, who has been working with the family for two decades, told MailOnline today that every new lead left the family on an 'emotional rollercoaster'.

He said: 'There is the initial high that comes with thinking we are getting closer and then that hope is dashed. But with every piece of the puzzle that comes, I think we are closer to her than we have ever been before.'

Mr Garrigan speculated that the police may have been looking for vegetation that is a different color or growing in a different way during their search.

The area where the police conducted their search this week is 3,000ft from where the family received a tip-off for their investigation.

They are currently awaiting soil samples which are being tested for human decomposition. The results should be available in the next few weeks, Mr Garrigan said.

New information: An anonymous tip led a private investigator working on the case to organize a search of Middlesex Fells Reservation

Miss Melanson, who was about to turn 15, was the youngest person at the party at a popular teenage hangout near the Woburn-Stoneham town line in 1989.

On the night she went missing, there 
were unconfirmed reports that the 14-year-old had walked off into the 
woods with another party-goer.

There is a $5,000 reward for any information on what may have happened to the teenage girl.

In July, cadaver dogs zeroed in on a small patch of parkland near the spot mentioned in a recent anonymous tip. Michael Gariggan said that three dogs were alerted to a small area of land in a search of Middlesex Fells Reservation.

Garrigan, who has worked on the case since 1991 on a pro-bono basis, said he recently received new information from a man in New Hampshire who suggested that police check the Middlesex Fells Reservation in Stoneham.

He said one of the teenage boys last seen with Melanson was spotted there later that night.

During the search in July involving 11 teams with cadaver dogs, Garrigan said at least three of the animals picked up on an ‘area of interest’ in the 2,500-acre park.

He described the area as a 15-by-15 foot square patch of land that would have been ‘very accessible’ in 1989.

Melanson, who would now be 37, was described by her relatives as kind and thoughtful. Before her disappearance, she was looking forward to having her braces removed and was excited about getting a pair of leather boots for her birthday.

The private investigator's tip line can be reached at 866-637-4907.
