Detectives investigating fraud at welfare-to-work company A4e arrested a sixth person yesterday.

The firm, which holds Government contracts, is owned by David Cameron’s former adviser, Emma Harrison.

In January, four former A4e employees, two men and two women, were arrested after it was alleged that they had falsely claimed that customers had been placed into employment.

Three of the staff involved were suspended once the allegations had been made and the other had already left the business.

All four have now left the company.

Another woman was arrested in March. All have been released on bail.

Yesterday,
 a 33-year-old man was arrested in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, on 
suspicion of fraud. He was also released on bail.

Police
 officers first visited the firm’s offices in Slough after allegations 
were referred to them by the Department for Work and Pensions.

A spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police officers investigating allegations of fraud in connection with A4e have arrested a sixth person.

'The 33-year-old man was arrested from an address in Milton Keynes this morning.

'The arrest was on suspicion of fraud and he has been released on bail until mid-June.

'Four
 people arrested in January, two men aged 35 and 41, and two women aged 
28 and 49, and a 35-year-old woman arrested in March, have also been 
released on bail until various dates in May and June.

'The investigation remains ongoing and there are no further updates at this time.'
