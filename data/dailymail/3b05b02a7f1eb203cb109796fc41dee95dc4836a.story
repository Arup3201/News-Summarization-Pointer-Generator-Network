In a land where ‘We’re Number One!’ is the preferred chant from the little to the major leagues, the role of underdog is not overly prized. But maybe, just maybe, the Americans are learning to love the idea of someone else being the favourites. Just for a change.

The battling defiance of their ‘soccer’ team at the World Cup captured the imagination of a public reared on a diet of domination by the USA. Or USA, USA, USA, as the folks in the bleachers are wont to sing.

Now, as Tom Watson leads a relatively inexperienced side into action against one of the most heavily favoured European teams in Ryder Cup history, they’ve been presented with another opportunity to blow away all thoughts of meek capitulation. And, to use the famous military quote resurrected as a tribute to goalkeeper Tim Howard holding the line in Brazil, tell their critics: ‘Nuts!’

Butch Harmon says team USA's inexperience could actually help them in this year's Ryder Cup

According to one of the sharpest analysts in the game, this US team – a squad containing four rookies and not a single player from inside the world’s top five – will actually benefit from their rawness. Fewer Ryder Cup matches played, says Butch Harmon, means fewer scars from repeated exposure to hammerings by Europe.

Swing guru Harmon, who insists that the Americans are stronger  without an out-of-form Tiger Woods dragging them down, bristles at the notion that this may be one of the worst USA teams in history.

‘I wouldn’t say it’s one of the weakest, I think it is one of the most inexperienced,’ he said, adding: ‘All of the players on the team are good players, all the players are very capable.

‘And I think the fact that it’s an inexperienced team is good for the US, because these guys that haven’t played in a lot of Ryder Cups, quite frankly, aren’t used to getting their brains beat out by the European – unlike a lot of veterans. And that brings a lot of energy to the team.

Rickie Fowler has only played in one Ryder Cup, but could be his team's key man at Gleneagles

‘These younger and less experienced players, they aren’t scarred. You go back to the 1999 – 2000 or 2001, and look at what Tiger Woods did to Ernie Els, Davis Love or Phil Mickelson, where he just beat them every time, and time again. That wears on you.

‘You’ve got Phil Mickelson, Jim Furyk, Keegan Bradley … you might have four or five at the most who played at Medinah, who were there for that great comeback by the European team last time out.

‘These young kids, they weren’t there. They didn’t experience it, they watched it - and they want to be part of this next one to have a chance to be on the team that brings the Cup back.

‘You’ve got Mickelson who has played in nine Ryder Cups, Furyk who has played in eight, and after that Zach Johnson has only played in three, and then you go down to a lot of them are first-timers, while Rickie Fowler, Bradley, Webb Simpson, they’ve all played in one apiece.

Phil Mickelson is the most experienced member of the American team, having played in nine Ryder Cups

‘These young kids, they’re not that far removed from playing in college where they are used to play as a team. When you look at the age of Rickie Fowler at 25, Patrick Reed at 24, Jordan Spieth is only 21.

‘So they understand the team atmosphere from their college days and that’s why they’re looking forward to it. They’re all talking about “Man I get to put on the red, white and blue, this is the coolest thing.”

‘And the other thing you can say about these young kids, they all played Walker Cup together. They’ve all been on Walker Cup teams and they understand it.

‘Jordan Spieth will be using the same putter cover he used in the junior Ryder Cup here - he said: “I just want the good vibes I had the last time I was at Gleneagles.”’

Harmon describes the young Yanks as ‘really jacked up for this’, which presumably means they’re quite keen to win. And to prove themselves comfortable in the distinctly un-American garb of unfancied outsiders.

At just 21, Jordan Speith is the youngest member of USA's Ryder Cup team

‘I think being an underdog gives you a little more incentive, it makes you want to show how good we are,’ said Harmon, who coaches Fowler, Mickelson and Jimmy Walker.

‘I’ve told Jimmy, who’s never even attended a Ryder Cup before, that he’s got to get ready for it, because it’s the greatest thing you will ever do in your career

‘I told my guys: “Embrace it. You’re not ready for what you’re going to hear, but embrace it. You know there’s one way to quiet the crowd, just make a lot of birdies.”

‘The European team, when you look at where they are in world rankings, is a very strong team and they will be heavily favourite. But as you know, you have to play the match on the golf course and not on paper. Knowing all the guys on the team so well as I do, they’re all very up for it.’

The American's have only won the Ryder Cup once in the last six attempts, their last win was in 2008

The Americans have often been accused of simply not buying into the team ethos, the friendly but very distinct us-and-them mentality, needed to triumph against the odds. None has been the target of these accusations more persistently than arch-individualist Tiger Woods. So, does his absence – partly through injury, although also because he was playing so poorly as to make a captain’s pick almost impossible for Watson, actually strengthen the away team?

Harmon said: ‘Well the last time they won Tiger wasn’t on the team, whether they’re stronger…they’re stronger without Tiger the way he’s playing because he hasn’t played well. Obviously physically he couldn’t play anyway.

‘But yeah, I don’t think they lose anything by not having him at this point in time, because at this point in time he’s not the Tiger Woods that we remember.’
