Warning: Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood took aim at 'lazy' civil servants who survive year after year

Thousands of civil servants are ‘lazy’ and have been allowed to remain unchallenged in their jobs for years, Britain’s top mandarin admitted today.

Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, said the bottom 10 per cent of civil servants were below par and could be sacked unless they raise their game.

It means that up to 40,000 of the 400,000 or so officials across central government could face being managed out as a result of their ‘performance problems’.

The move comes as ministers approved a large increase in the number of politically appointed civil servants.

The Coalition says the establishment of ‘extended ministerial offices’ – stuffed with officials personally appointed by Cabinet ministers – is necessary to ‘put a rocket’ under Whitehall.

Senior Tory figures have accused mandarins of dragging their feet over implementing vital reforms and hope the expanded private offices, staffed by those loyal to ministers, will force top civil servants to raise their game.

However, the reforms will lead to accusations that the Government wants to politicise the Civil Service and end its proud tradition of independence.

The changes could also lead to a rise in the number of special advisers, who report directly to a minister and do not have to be politically independent.

These so-called ‘spads’ could even lead the new offices as a minister’s ‘chief of staff’.

However Sir Jeremy said the shake-up also needed to identify Whitehall's worst performers.

He said: ‘There is a willingness to identify the top 25 per cent of people and give them proper rewards, but just as important – more important in some ways – the bottom 10 per cent, and give them an opportunity to improve themselves or, if not, move them out.

‘Nothing annoys good civil servants more than seeing lazy civil servants surviving year after year without anyone addressing that performance problem.

‘Addressing performance management is a huge way of motivating the rest.’

Improvements: Ministers hope that the reforms will force civil servants to up their game

When the Coalition came to office in 2010, the Conservative Party pledged to cut the number of special advisers.

Since
 then, however, David Cameron has become disillusioned with the pace of 
reform, and he believes that permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats who 
lead government departments, have too much power.

Earlier
 this year, Steve Hilton, Mr Cameron’s former director of strategy, 
attacked ‘paper-shuffling mandarins’ who pushed through changes without 
ministerial approval, often resulting in the Prime Minister learning 
about Government decisions from the media.

Former prime minister Tony Blair 
later joined the attack, saying that the Civil Service was ‘hopelessly 
bureaucratic’ and ‘not fit for purpose’.

Reform plan: Francis Maude is behind the scheme to increase the number of politically appointed civil servants

The reforms follow the decision earlier this year by Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude to ask the Institute for Public Policy Research, a centre-Left think tank, to examine the workings of civil services in other English-speaking countries – including Australia, New Zealand and Canada – and find out if there were ways to improve the British system.

The think-tank concluded that, in comparison to politicians in the other countries, British ministers were under-supported.

Mr Maude will today announce that he has accepted the IPPR’s recommendations to allow ministers in charge of departments to set up the ‘extended ministerial offices’.

These offices will comprise a mixture of civil servants and special advisers, all appointed directly by the minister, rather than by the permanent secretary in charge of the department.

Some staff will be appointed from outside the Civil Service on short-term contracts to ensure that they do not kowtow to the permanent secretary. However, all staff will have to abide by the Civil Service code.

Guy Lodge, associate director of the IPPR, said: ‘In comparative terms, UK ministers have relatively little direct support to draw on to enable them to do their jobs effectively. Strengthening ministerial offices will make Whitehall more responsive and more effective.’
