Home Secretary Theresa May wants universities and colleges to ensure foreign students return to their countries after their studies are completed

Theresa May is pushing for new rules that will force colleges to ensure foreign students go home after completing their courses, it was reported yesterday.

The Home Secretary’s call follows fresh evidence, revealed by the Daily Mail last week, which shows that around 100,000 foreign students each year fail to return to their home countries once their studies are over.

A letter from Mrs May called for ‘decisive action to protect the integrity of the system and the reputation of our education sector’.

However, her attempt to make universities and colleges responsible is understood to have met fierce opposition from vice-chancellors and Coalition colleagues.

Universities Minister David Willetts is said to be sympathetic to the colleges’ pleas that they cannot be held responsible for the behaviour of students over whom they have no powers.

Migrants who come to study here from outside Europe are a lucrative source of earnings for universities, which can charge them up to triple the £9,000 fees charged to those from Britain and the EU.

Although the number of visas issued to non-EU foreign students has fallen since 2011 – when regulations were tightened up – government surveys suggest that a large number continue to come to Britain and not leave.

According to the Office for National Statistics, 145,000 non-EU students arrived here in 2012. Yet last year, only 50,000 non-EU students returned to their home countries.

Mrs May told Cabinet colleagues in March that she wanted new pressure on foreign students to obey the rules, following evidence of bogus courses and of students working for five-figure salaries and claiming benefits.

Ideas put forward included curbs on students bringing in dependants, sanctions against institutions which allow students to break the rules, and a requirement for universities to co-operate with immigration officers to ensure students return home.

Among open Tory opponents is former Foreign Office minister Lord Howell of Guildford, who is also the father-in-law of Chancellor George Osborne.

He said earlier this year that ‘being open for business means we’ve got to welcome the right people, including a lot of students and brilliant skilled people who add to our power in the world’.
