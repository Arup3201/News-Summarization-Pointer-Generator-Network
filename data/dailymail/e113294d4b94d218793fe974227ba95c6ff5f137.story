A study has found that a quarter of teenagers in America have received explicit pictures on their cellphones (posed by models) 

Almost four in ten teenagers in America have received explicit pictures on their cellphones, new research reveals today.

The study, by the University of Utah, also found that a fifth of youngsters have also sent a nude picture of themselves to someone else on their smartphone.

This has prompted researchers to warn that the practice could be more widespread in schools and colleges than first thought.

And they added that although the survey took place in the US, experts believe that the findings are applicable in most western countries where smartphones are widely used.

The study surveyed 1,130 undergraduate students about their experiences of sending x-rated snaps in high school.

Nearly 20 per cent reported they had sent a nude photo of themselves to another via cellphone while 38 per cent had received such a picture.

Of the number who had received one of these messages, nearly one in five had forwarded the picture to someone else.

Professor Don Strassberg, who conducted the study, said the risks of using a mobile phone to send intimate messages goes well beyond that of sharing print photographs as a form of flirting.

He said: 'Nothing has changed in that realm - except that the technology makes it easy and thus, more vulnerable to misuse.

'You lose control of the image the moment you push send.

'From there the risks, which can be especially grave for teens, range from embarrassment and humiliation to unwanted sexual advances to cyberbullying and blackmail, and though rare, possibly to felony charges for pornography trafficking because they are minors.'

The research was published online in the journal Computers in Human Behaviour and was conducted over a three-year period.

Participants were students enrolled in undergraduate psychology classes and queried about their experiences of sending explicit messages during high school - after 2007, when it became more commonplace.

Though the research was completed at a single, public institution, a quarter of the students surveyed attended high school outside Utah, and seven per cent outside the United States, providing a measure of economic and geographic diversity.

The researchers have also warned that the practice of sending explicit pictures is more widespread in schools than first thought 

Prof Strassberg added: 'Sexting is far from a rare occurrence and the ability of a recipient to forward on a sext to others can be problematic, especially for young women who share an explicit photo.

'Because once a sext has been sent, the sender has no control over who, or how many, will eventually see that picture. Other than the adolescent mentality that overestimates benefits over risks, we don’t yet know why teens are choosing to put themselves at risk.'

The research also found that both men and women send explicit messages but significantly more males had received an initmate picture on their mobile phone.

Professor Strassberg concluded that there are still a number of important questions about teen sexting that need reliable answers before adults can decide how - or even if - they should respond to the popular phenomenon.

He said further study is needed to better understand teen motives, get a clearer sense of their appreciation of possible consequences of sexting and whether sexting increases or decreases initiation of physical sexual interaction, among other issues.
