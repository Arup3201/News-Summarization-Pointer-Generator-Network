Police say ‘Time is running out’ in the search for the former beauty queen wife of the great grandson of scout movement founder Lord Baden-Powell who mysteriously went missing six days ago.

Today evidence bags were seized from the property where Gerard Baden-Clay is staying in Brisbane, Australia, as police continued their efforts to find his 43-year-old wife Allison.

Officers arrived at the home of Mr Baden-Clay's parents in the Kenmore area of the city and collected a number of unidentified items, although according to the Brisbane's Courier Mail a computer was among property seized.

Mystery: Allison Baden-Clay has been missing for six days. She is the wife of Gerard Baden-Clay, the great grandson of Scout movement founder Lord Robert Baden-Powell

Mr Baden-Clay is a descendant of Lord Baden-Powell, a former lieutenant-general in the British Army, who founded the Scout movement in the early 20th century.

He has told police that he last saw his wife when they went to sleep together on Thursday of last week.

He said when he woke up the following morning she was gone and that on Sunday, as he was driving to a police station to give details of the last time he saw his wife, he crashed his car into a bus stop and was taken to hospital with minor injuries before being released.

Despite the removal of evidence from his parents' property police say Mr Baden-Clay, a prominent Brisbane real estate agent  is ‘not considered a person of interest in his wife's disappearance’.

Today officers were also checking scrubland, drains and tunnels in the leafy suburbs surrounding the couple's home and police say they have spent four hours interviewing a woman believed to be a former colleague of Mr Baden-Clay.

So far more than 100 officers and volunteers have been involved in the search for mother of three but as yet no clues to her whereabouts have been uncovered.

Her fading mobile phone signal has been used to triangulate her last known location to an area spanning three suburbs and residents living in the area have been asked to check their properties for any sign of the woman or her mobile phone.

What happened? Mr Baden-Clay has told police that he last saw his wife when they went to sleep together on Thursday last week. When he woke up in the morning she was gone

Superintendent Shane Dall'osto said: 'Time is running out. We're looking for Allison. We believe she is still out there.'

Residents have also asked to keep an eye out for grey tracksuit pants, white running shoes and a white or black top - the clothing Mrs Baden-Clay was believed to be wearing when she disappeared.

'It is very diverse countryside - some of it is very unkempt and we are really appealing to the public, people that may not have searched their property, if they could do that,' added Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth.

He said he was particularly interested in hearing from anyone who saw either of the cars owned by the Baden-Clays - a white Toyota Prado and a silver Holden Captiva - being driven at the time she disappeared, between 8pm on Thursday and 6am on Friday.

The Forensic Crash Unit, he said, was investigating the incident in which Mr Baden-Clay's car crashed into the bus stop leaving him with bruised ribs.

Supt Ainsworth said Mr Baden-Clay was staying with his parents and had provided 'a version of events to police in relation to specific matters' relating to a scratch he had on his face.

Mrs Baden-Clay, who speaks five languages and is a former ballerina, is described as a creature of habit, waking every morning for her daily walk in the wealthy district where she lived.

Mr Baden-Clay's sister said earlier this week that he is under enormous pressure and is praying for his wife's safe return.

A profile about Mr Baden-Clay on a Brisbane real estate web page states: 'His personal philosophies of ethical excellence and team loyalty, derived from his lineage as the great-grandson of international Scouts founder Baden Powell, have clearly found their perfect landing spot in the field of real estate.'
