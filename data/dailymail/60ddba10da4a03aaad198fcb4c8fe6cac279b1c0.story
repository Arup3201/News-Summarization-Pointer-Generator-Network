This intrepid pet rabbit has been racking up the hare miles visiting beauty spots stretching from Edinburgh to the Isle of Skye with his owner.

Mini lop rabbit Jared has toured many of Scotland's most famous sights with Korrasut Khopuangklang, often taking in the views from his vantage point in a basket attached to the front of the law student's bicycle.

Over the past three years Mr Khopuangklang has photographed his pet at attractions including Edinburgh Castle, Glencoe, and the beaches of North Berwick, and the final year student has now put London on the pair's list of places to visit.

The travelling is all done without a hutch as Mr Khopuangklang usually carries Jared along on his bike or in the car.

The Edinburgh University student says Jared takes it all in his stride.

He said: 'He just loves to sit completely still and be photographed. He's very patient.

'When I take him out to the park he sits in a basket on the handlebars of my bicycle.

'He loves the outdoors and doesn't mind being in the car on the longer journeys.'

Jared has also become a bit of a star on YouTube with his unflappable photo session sitting in a flower pot.

And the roving rabbit's sightseeing salad days look set to continue as Korrasut plans to take him further afield.

He said: 'He loves travelling and I'd like to take him to other places.

'He'd look great posing at Stonehenge or in front of the Houses of Parliament, although that might be too far for him.'Â
