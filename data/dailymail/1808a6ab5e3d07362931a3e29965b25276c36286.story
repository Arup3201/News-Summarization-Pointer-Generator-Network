'The suspects had absolutely no 
regard for public safety, and they could have very easily mown down an 
unsuspecting shopper or member of staff.

'We continue to reiterate appeals for information and urge anyone who may have seen the sequence of events to contact us.

'We are also appealing to anyone who may have seen the three motorbikes being driven from Brent Cross to Mill Hill. We urge anyone with information to call our incident room.'

The terrifying smash and grab came a day before a pawnbroker's was targeted less than two miles away by another gang riding motorbikes.

A group of three smashed windows with sledgehammers at the pawnbrokers in Kilburn, north west London, making off with fistfuls of jewellery.

Otis Corby, who works in a Cash Converters shop on Kilburn High Road, said the raid happened in the blink of an eye.

The attack comes only a day after six axe wielding robbers horrified shoppers during the high-speed smash-and-grab at Brent Cross

Witnesses said 'the raid happened in the blink of an eye' as the gang left with fistfuls of valuables

He said: 'It was very quick and happened in seconds. There was three guys on mopeds all with sledgehammers.

'There was a loud crash and then they made off down the road with whatever they had got.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'At 10am this morning three men all wearing helmets took part in a smash-and-grab raid in Kilburn.

'They smashed windows with sledgehammers and made off with jewellery.'

No arrests have been made in connection with this incident.

Police refused to confirm if they believed the attacks were related and said it was 'too early to speculate' whether they were looking at links between the incidents.

The thugs who targeted Brent Cross are believed to have taken Cartier and Rolex watches as well as other items of jewellery before speeding off.

Witnesses
described how shoppers began to panic as the robbery took place, with 
many people running for the exits.

Some shops would not let customers 
leave while the incident was underway.

Michelle Webber, 36, was at the 
shopping centre when the robbery took place.

She entered at the same 
entrance which the gang are believed to have used, close to John Lewis 
and New Look.

She said as she entered - about 10 minutes before the robbery took place - she heard a man behind her say: 'let the fun begin'.

Shortly afterwards she described how a wave of panic gripped the shopping centre.

'A man came running towards us shouting 'everybody out'.

'My first thought was that there was a
bomb and I just started thinking about my children and my family, my 
stomach turned.

'People started running out of the stores in a panic.

'There was a surge of people coming towards us. They were all running at the same time away from what was happening.

'All of a sudden the shutters started 
coming down in the shops around us and we realised that something 
serious had happened.

'I caught up with the guy who had been shouting and
he said there were some guys upstairs on bikes with pickaxes who had 
broken into the jeweller's.'

Photographer Rick Treister was on his
way to the Apple store in Brent Cross when he heard the sound of 
screaming and breaking glass.

Seconds later the three bikes came roaring towards him past Clarks shoe store.

Crime scene: A section of the shopping centre was closed off as the investigation into the robbery started

Damage: As well as taking jewellery, the gang also left a trail of destruction in the shopping centre

He said: 'I did not have time to be frightened, the whole thing did not seem real.

'It was like the James Bond film, you could not believe something like this was happening inside Brent Cross.

'I just grabbed my camera phone and 
managed to get one picture. The guy on the front bike shouted something 
at me when he went past.

'The whole place was going mad. The 
women in John Lewis were screaming and the man in the jewellery store 
ran out after the robbers shouting “You b******s!'

'Watches were just dropping off the motorbikes as they went. They accelerated away and I don’t know where they went after that.'

There were no injuries, however, an elderly man was treated for shock at the scene.

A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman 
said: 'No firearms were seen. The suspects fled the scene on the 
motorbikes in the direction of Hendon Central.

'The motorbikes were subsequently found abandoned a short time later at a nearby golf course.'

A
spokesman for Brent Cross Shopping Centre said: 'We can confirm that 
there was an incident at the centre earlier this morning when there was 
an attempted robbery on a store at Brent Cross.

'The
police have cordoned off a section of the centre to investigate the 
incident and we are assisting them with their enquiries. 

'A
small area is closed off to the public and Brent Cross staff are 
directing customers to alternative entrances.  The majority of stores 
remain open as normal.'
