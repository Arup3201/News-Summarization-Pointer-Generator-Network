A British soldier awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross died in vain because of an order to prevent damage to Taliban mud huts, an inquest will be told this summer.

Colleagues of Lance Corporal James Ashworth – who won the UK’s highest gallantry medal – are expected to tell a coroner they were denied powerful weapons to take on the Taliban due to fears mortars and rockets could damage buildings. 

Soldiers from the Grenadier Guards will claim James died because he was forced to crawl to within a few feet of an enemy sniper in a mud hut while clutching a grenade, rather than firing from a safer distance.

Last night his father Duane Ashworth accused top brass of sacrificing his son’s life to protect the building, saying his pride in his son’s VC was now coupled with anger over the way in which he had died.

‘We can build more mud huts but nobody can bring back my son. This is hard to stomach,’ he said.

Just weeks before L/Cpl Ashworth died in June last year, new tactics were introduced by the multi-national forces in Afghanistan that prevented use of heavy weapons in all but the most exceptional  circumstances.

The change – in response to a request from President Hamid Karzai to protect local infrastructure – meant British patrols no longer carried mortars and shoulder-held rocket launchers on routine operations, forcing them to engage any targets at close range. 

L/Cpl Ashworth would still be alive if they had been able to use the weapons that were restricted just a month earlier, his comrades will say. 

The revelation follows last week’s ruling by the Supreme Court that any decision to deny troops access to adequate weaponry could constitute a negligent decision and therefore a breach of their human rights – potentially opening the floodgates for hundreds of damages claims from bereaved families.

Yesterday, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned that the ruling could prevent British soldiers carrying out vital missions because their commanders will be frightened about being sued if their troops are badly wounded or killed.

He said: ‘We can’t have commanders living in fear of how lawyers back in London might interpret their battlefield decisions that are vital to protecting our national security.’ 

L/Cpl Ashworth was awarded a VC after taking on a Taliban sniper team in Mohammed Zai, Helmand province, on June 13 last year.

He was killed while getting into position to throw a grenade through the window of the mud hut occupied by a Taliban sniper.

James’s father Duane, 45, from the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, added: ‘James was put in even graver danger by the lack of basic weapons.

James or one of his colleagues could have fired a mortar or a rocket-launcher from a longer range and in all likelihood he would be here today.’ 

Platoon commander Captain Michael Dobbin will be called to the inquest at Kettering magistrates’ court on August 1.

Grenadiers who fought a close-range gun battle in the mud hut are also expected to give evidence.

A Grenadiers source said: ‘While Captain Dobbin will support the Army’s version of events, the junior soldiers will express their frustration about having to fight the Taliban with effectively one arm tied behind their backs that summer. 

‘James would still be alive if we’d used the same weaponry we used on the 09/10 tour.’

A legal expert told The Mail on Sunday that the failure to provide adequate weaponry could provide grounds for a future negligence claim by the Ashworth family against the MoD.

Shubhaa Srinivasan of Leigh Day & Co said: ‘If weapons were denied to soldiers as a result of a decision taken sufficiently away from the battlefield... it may be possible to establish liability against the Ministry of Defence under negligence or the Human Rights Act. 

‘The MoD does not have carte blanche to fail to equip troops.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts remain with the family of James Ashworth. UK forces continue to operate under established Rules of Engagement which give them the right to defend themselves and to call in the fire support they need in any situation.’
