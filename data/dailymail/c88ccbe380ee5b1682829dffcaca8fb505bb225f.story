Temperatures are set to soar to double figures across Britain this week making it hotter than Morocco, as forecasters confirm 2014 was the UK's warmest year on record.

Conditions will be mild and dry for much of this week, with the mercury set to reach 11C in some parts today, 12C tomorrow and up to 14C by Friday – making the UK hotter than many European destinations including Spain.

The warmer weather comes as it was revealed that last year was the hottest ever for the UK, with an average temperature of 9.9C. The previous record, set in 2006, saw an average temperature of 9.7C.

Temperatures are set to soar to 11C today, 12C tomorrow and up to 14C by Friday - more than double the national January average of 6.4C for the UK - making Britain hotter than Morocco. Pictured: The frosty banks of Woodhead Reservoir in Longdendale, north Derbyshire, early today

Despite the warmer weather this week, Friday  will bring a spell of wet and windy weather thanks to a low pressure system moving in across the country. It will bring gusts of up to 70mph in some parts. Pictured: Sheep grazing in a frosty field at Woodhead in the Derbyshire Peak District

Britain will experience fairly mild conditions this week, with temperatures considerably higher than last week. The mercury will reach 10C to 11C in most parts of southern England today. Pictured: Heavy frost covers a flooded field around the River Avon near, Malmesbury, Wiltshire

As millions of commuters headed back to work today following the Christmas break, they were greeted with dark, foggy conditions in many parts of the UK. Forecasters said today will remain fairly dry but overcast. Pictured: Fog on the M42, just south of Birmingham, this morning

This graph, by the Met Office, showing the average recorded temperatures in the UK since 1850 shows how 2014 was the warmest on record

 

The 2014 record means that eight of the UK's top ten warmest years have happened since 2002.

Despite the record-breaking conditions, no individual months through the year saw records for temperature - instead each month was consistently warm, with only August seeing below-average temperatures.

As well as beating the warmest year record, the Met Office also confirmed that 2014 became the fourth wettest year ever to be recorded.

The provisional rainfall total of 1297.1mm became the fourth highest total on record for the UK dating back to 1910, meaning five of the UK's top six wettest years have happened since 2000.

A large contribution to the high annual rainfall total came from very wet weather in January and February. May, October and November were also wetter than average and August was especially wet across Northern Scotland.

Most other months were drier than average in most areas, and September was the driest in the series from 1910 for the UK.

While 2015 has remained largely dry so far, forecasters predict wet and windy conditions will set in towards the end of the week thanks to a low pressure system moving in across the country.

Despite the warmer conditions this week – which will see temperatures more than double the January average of 6.4C – the end of the week will bring a spell of stormy weather.

A low pressure system moving across Britain early Friday will bring gale-force winds of up to 70mph in some parts of northern Scotland, and up to 50mph across the rest of the UK.

Temperatures are set to reach 11C in some parts today, 12C tomorrow and soar to 14C by the end of the week, making it considerably mild

Lindsey Smyth took this photograph of a deer with its tongue our at Loch Quoich near Lochaber, Scotland. She said: 'My sister and I were driving around and suddenly came across this one. We like to try and get pictures of nature but we haven't seen anything like this before'

Forecasters said there will be some 'quite strong gusts of wind particularly in northern parts' but added that all parts of Britain will see high winds.

Laura Young, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: 'It's not going to be pleasant and most parts will see showery, wet and windy weather.'

She said the far north of Scotland could see winds in excess of 70mph, and perhaps stronger in Shetland, while much of the UK will see winds of between 40mph and 50mph in coastal areas.

The winds on Friday will come as a result of a low pressure system brought by a 200knot jet stream which is heading for the UK.

However, before the stormy weather sets in, Britain will experience fairly mild conditions, with temperatures considerably higher than last week.

The mercury will reach between 10C and 11C in most parts of southern England today, and 7C to 8C in northern regions. The national average temperature for January is 6.4C

It will be even warmer on Tuesday, with temperatures reaching 12C widely, before it dips overnight to lows of just 1C to 2C.

Despite the milder temperatures across much of the UK, a group of red deer could be seen in heavy snow at the Cairngorms National Park

The stags could be seen in the snow-covered pine forest of Cairngorms National Park. Temperatures in Scotland are set to reach 7-8C today, which is above the national January average of 6.4C for the UK.  Forecasters said the mild conditions will remain for the rest of the week

Miss Young said the sudden drop in temperature on Tuesday night could cause fog and frost on Wednesday morning.

She said Wednesday would see temperatures return to double figures, with warmer air from the Atlantic moving across the country.

By Friday and Saturday temperatures are expected to reach up to 14C in some places, with overnight temperatures of 10C to 11C, she said.

It means Britain will be hotter than Spain, Turkey, Malta, Majorca and Morocco.

Miss Young added: 'It's a really mixed week, it gradually gets warmer as the week goes on. It will be very, very mild.

'It might come as a bit of shock to most people considering how cold it has been.'

Last week, temperatures plummeted to -4C in some parts of the country and daytime temperatures averaged at just 2C.

Heavy traffic and congestion built-up on the M27 near Southampton early today

Commuters face rush-hour delays and rail replacement buses as they head back to work after the Christmas break today. 

Train passengers on Cross Country and First Great Western services were warned to expect an over-run on planned engineering work between Weston-super-Mare and Bristol Temple Meads this morning, with buses replacing trains and journey times extended by up to 60 minutes.

A Network Rail spokesman said there was expected to be an over-run of 60-90 minutes which would affect one or two trains, which would be replaced by buses.

'It is an inconvenience but people will still be able to make their journey,' he said. He said Taunton to London services would not be affected.

There were other problems for rush-hour train travellers this morning. A signalling problem at Merstham in Surrey prevented trains towards London from stopping at Redhill, Merstham or Coulsdon South. This affected passengers travelling on Southern and Thameslink services.

Another signalling problem, near Eaglescliffe in County Durham, meant buses had to replace trains between Middlesbrough and Darlington stations during the morning peak.

A broken-down train at Harrow & Wealdstone in north west London led to delays between London and Milton Keynes Central in Buckinghamshire.

As many roads were hit by fog, huge queues built up on the M25 where there were two big rush-hour crashes.

One led to jams on the clockwise section in Surrey, between J6 for the A22 at Godstone and J8 for the A217 at Reigate.

And in Hertfordshire, the anti-clockwise stretch was blocked by a crash between J24, linking the A111 at Potters Bar, and J25, the A10 junction at

Enfield.

Meanwhile the AA warned that today is expected to be one of the busiest of the year for car breakdowns, with people using their cars after a restful period over Christmas. 

The motoring organisation expects to attend to around 19,000 call-outs, 30 per cent more than on a normal Monday.

An AA/Populus survey of 16,165 AA members found that a third will have had at least one car standing unused throughout the festive period that will be relied on today.

AA members in south east England (36 per cent) are most likely to be in this situation, compared with only 28 per cent in north east England and 19 per cent in London.

AA patrolman of the year Mark Spowage said 'The first working day back in January is traditionally the busiest day of the year for breakdowns with flat batteries the main culprit.

'The issue is that many cars get left unused for up to a fortnight in often cold conditions, which causes the power output of the battery to drop.'

But there was some good news. A planned 24-hour bus strike scheduled to take place in London today was called off.

The walkout over pay and working conditions would have affected more than 20 routes, including the 58 bus from Walthamstow to East Ham, the 308 from Wanstead to Clapton, the 339 from Leytonstone and the W14 from Leyton to Woodford Bridge.

Staff employed by company Tower Transit and the Unite union have instead agreed to meet at the conciliation service Acas to discuss pay.

Bus drivers voted in favour of industrial action on December 18 with the second strike planned for today.

Unite claims drivers have been offered a pay rise of 2.35 per cent pay rise, 0.15 per cent lower than other bus drivers.

The first 24-hour strike on December 29th affected 13 routes and caused 'moderate disruption', according to TfL.
