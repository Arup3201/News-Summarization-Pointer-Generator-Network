When J.K. Rowling sat down in a café in Edinburgh and penned her first Harry Potter book, little did she know the literary phenomenon she was creating.

Until now, predicting exactly what makes book a bestseller was somewhat of a mystery, yet researchers from New York claim to have created an algorithm to do just that.

By analysing the words used in classic books, the algorithm was able to correctly predict which books were bestsellers, and which were less successful, in 84 per cent of cases.

Computer scientists analysed books including Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, pictured left, and Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol, right. They then used an algorithm to predict each book's relative success. By comparing the predictions with book sales, the researchers correctly guessed success in 84% of cases

Successful books tended to feature 
more nouns and adjectives, as well as a disproportionate use of the 
words ‘and’ and ‘but’ - when compared with less successful titles.

The most popular books also featured 
more verbs relating to ‘thought-processing’ such as ‘recognised’ and 
‘remembered’.

Verbs that serve the purpose of quotes and reports, for 
example the word ‘say’ and ‘said’, were heavily featured throughout the 
bestsellers.

Alternatively, less successful books 
featured ‘topical, cliché’ words and phrases such as ‘love’, as well as negative and extreme words including 
‘breathless’ and ‘risk’.

Poor-selling books also favoured the 
use of ‘explicitly descriptive verbs of actions and emotions’ such as 
‘wanted’, ‘took’, ‘promised’ ‘cried’ and ‘cheered’. Books that made 
explicit reference to body parts also scored poorly.

Overall, they found that successful books contained a high number of nouns and adjectives - and plenty of quotes.

The algorithm, developed at Stony Brook University, used a method called ‘statistical stylometry’ that can mathematically analyse words and grammar in text.

Computer scientists from the university began by downloading classic books from the Project Gutenberg archive, including Charles Dickens' A Tale Of Two Cities, Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol and Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe.

They also scanned bestselling lists on Amazon.

Each book’s text was scanned using a specially-designed algorithm. This algorithm then predicted the success of each title.

These predictions were compared to the success of each title, based on historical stats, figures and critical reaction, and were able to match the popularity of the book 84 per cent of the time.

Negative words and references to body parts were most commonly used in less successful books, according to the study

‘breathless’ and ‘risk’.

Poor-selling books also favoured the use of ‘explicitly descriptive verbs of actions and emotions’ such as ‘wanted’, ‘took’, ‘promised’ ‘cried’ and ‘cheered’. Books that made explicit reference to body parts also scored poorly.

Miguel De Cervantes’ Don Quixote scored highly, as did Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe.

Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol was
 among the least successful, alongside My Life As A Man, by Philip Roth.

‘Predicting the success of literary works poses a massive dilemma for publishers and aspiring writers alike,’ explained assistant professor Yejin Choi.

‘Previous work has attempted to gain insights into the ‘secret recipe’ of successful books. But most of these studies were qualitative, based on a dozen books, and focused primarily on high-level content - the personalities of protagonists and antagonists and the plots.

‘Our work examines a considerably larger collection - 800 books - over multiple genres, providing insights into lexical, syntactic, and discourse patterns that characterise the writing styles commonly shared among the successful literature.’

The findings have been published by the Association of Computational Linguistics.
