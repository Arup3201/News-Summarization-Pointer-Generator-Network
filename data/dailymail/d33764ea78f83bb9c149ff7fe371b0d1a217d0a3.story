A businessman is believed to have fatally stabbed his wife and left his daughter fighting for her life before knifing himself to death - just months after he was released from a mental hospital.

Michael Greaney, 53, who had a history of 'serious' mental issues, stabbed his daughter Michelle, 21, in the chest before killing his wife Valerie, 49, at their home in Cork, reports suggest.

The physical therapist was admitted to the Central Mental Hospital in 2013 after being found guilty of assaulting and falsely imprisoning a woman and a barring order was put in place.

But the order was removed at the request of the family after his wife pleaded on his behalf saying he had been under tremendous financial and psychological pressure at the time.

The couple's 16-year-old daughter raised the alarm at 3.30pm yesterday after coming across the suspected murder-suicide.

Her sister, 21-year-old Michelle, was stabbed in the chest, but managed to get outside the house despite her injuries and was found collapsed on the street by neighbours.

She was rushed to Cork University Hospital for emergency surgery to injuries initially said to be life-threatening. Her condition was later described as critical but stable. 

It is understood her mother Valerie was found in the hallway of the home with a stab wound to her chest and died shortly after being discovered. 

Mr Greaney, who also worked as the gardener in the Bishop of Cloyne's palace, was found in an upstairs bedroom with wounds believed to have been self-inflicted.

His other daughter Sarah was not physically harmed and was able to run from the house in Cobh to raise the alarm, but she has been left severely traumatised by what she witnessed. 

Mr Greaney had a history of mental issues and was admitted to the Central Mental Hospital in 2013 following an attack on a family member while Michelle had recently graduated

When he appeared in court in 2013, Mr Greaney spoke of his remorse over the attack in which he attempted to smother the woman by stuffing a rag into her mouth, according to the Herald. 

Seconds after the attack, in which the woman managed to struggle free, he attempted to slash his artery using a Stanley knife.

Family friend, Darragh McGann, who attended the scene to offer what support he could, said the entire community was heartbroken by the tragedy.

'The sympathies and prayers of the entire Cobh community goes out to the Greaney family at this terrible time. It is just so, so sad,' he said. 

A security source told the Irish Mirror: 'The father had a serious mental health issue. It's not a case at all that he lost his temper and lashed out violently.

'That's something that is being stressed by those who knew him. There was an incident two years ago and he ended up in the Central Mental Hospital.

'The Greaneys are a very well respected and popular family in Cobh. An incident like this, especially at Christmas, will shock the community.'

The family had suffered a tragedy four weeks previously when Mrs Greaney's mother passed away.

One neighbour said: 'Valerie's mother is there, God rest her, and now her daughter will be joining her. This is a terrible tragedy.'

Another said: 'How could any man do such a thing? That poor woman only buried her mother last month and now she is gone, too and God knows if her girl will survive.

'It is unbelievable for such a thing to happen, particularly at this time of year.'

Forensics sealed off the Greaneys' house in Cork, Ireland, and the bodies of the couple were taken to Cork University Hospital where postmortems will be carried out today

Mr Greaney was a well-known physical therapist in Cobh, where he worked alongside his wife. In his youth he was a keen rower and won three All-Ireland medals competing in coastal races. 

He served as a Minister of the Eucharist in St Colman's Cathedral and was seen distributing Holy Communion to parishioners, including his wife, at Mass on Christmas Day.

The 53-year-old  owned a landscaping business and a number of properties near the Cathedral in the town centre.

It is believed he had been suffering from severe financial pressures and some of his properties had been taken into receivership the week before Christmas.

The Greaneys' house and the surrounding area was sealed off as forensic officers worked at the scene.

The bodies of the couple were taken from their home and assistant state pathologist Dr Margot Bolster began her postmortems on the bodies at the morgue in Cork University Hospital at 10am. 

Michelle Greaney had been on holiday in August this year and is now said to be in a critical condition

Detectives are waiting for medical clearance to interview Michelle in the hope that she will be able to tell them exactly what happened inside the house.

Garda Supt John Quilter, who is heading up the investigation described the deaths as 'a family tragedy' and said police were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. 

The end-of-terrace property is situated close to the town centre in a modest but well-kept row of houses beside the town's main cemetery. The Greaneys' house still has a string of Christmas lights and reindeer outside.

Local councillor Kieran McCarthy last night said that news of the tragedy has left the town distraught.

'It's shocking, that's the best way to describe it,' the Sinn Féin councillor said. 'I don't know how people are going to deal with it.

'They are just trying to take it in for the time being.'

Bishop of Cloyne William Crean said he was deeply shocked at the news.

'I ask the faithful of the diocese to pray for all of those affected by these sad events,' he said.

The 21-year-old recently graduated from University College Cork and had been working for an online babywear retailer

'May the light of Christ, whose coming into the world we celebrate at Christmas, help to guide us through this great darkness which has fallen on the community of Cobh, and on the diocese as a whole.' 

Michelle Greaney recently graduated from University College Cork and had been working for an online babywear retailer. 

A picture posted online shows her in her graduation gown, flanked by her parents, her younger sister and her boyfriend. 

Mr Greaney set up his business, Greaney Physical Therapy, with his wife more than a decade ago.

The clinic website states that they specialise in the areas of sports and occupational injuries, hypnotherapy and reflexology. 

It also highlights Mr Greaney's background in rowing at a 'national level' and his 'deep involvement in coaching football and running teams'.  

Neighbours gathered in shock yesterday around the family home yesterday as the community in Cobh was united in grief. 

Detectives have appealed for witnesses to contact Cobh Garda station on 021 490 8530, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or any other Garda station.
