Louis van Gaal has been showing his softer side this World Cup by allowing his Holland stars to take time out their busy schedule to spend time with their WAGs.

The Dutch face Costa Rica in their quarter-final on Saturday, but that did not stop them from being given some time off to relax with their partners on Tuesday afternoon.

Leroy Fer and Jasper Cillessen were both photographed out-and-about with their other halves, while Robin van Persie, Nigel de Jongh and Co kept the fans happy by signing some autographs.

But Arjen Robben, embroiled in controversy since his diving claims after Sunday's 2-1 victory over Mexico, managed to steer clear of the photographers.

The forward openly admitted trying to con the referee and eventually won the defining penalty in the 93rd minute.

Jose Mourinho, who coached the Dutchman during his first spell at Chelsea, said Robben ‘tries to get an advantage’ by winning free-kicks and penalties.

‘He was my player and I know better than many what a fantastic player he is’, said Mourinho.

‘I also know that because of his speed and because of his creativity he is punished a lot with fouls by opponents who cannot stop him,’ the Portuguese boss told Yahoo.

‘I also know that sometimes he tries to get an advantage and he tries to get a free-kick or he tries to get a penalty.

‘I think it’s important for the players to help the referees by being honest on the pitch, to try to win the right way.

‘But the reality is that not every player behaves that way and referees have a difficult job.'

Penalty: This foul from Rafael Marquez resulted in a penalty which Huntelaar scored to put Holland through
