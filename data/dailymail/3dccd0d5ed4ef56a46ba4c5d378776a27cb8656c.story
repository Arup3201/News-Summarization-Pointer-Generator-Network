Karim Benzema insists Real Madrid are still focused on winning La Liga despite falling four points behind leaders Barcelona following Sunday's 2-1 El Clasico defeat.

The striker, speaking to Marca, said Real are still thinking about the title as well as winning the Champions League having achieved La Decima last season.

The France international also welcomed the recent return of Luka Modric, who had been out with a thigh injury since November, and said: 'Modric has been good for us, we’ve missed him.'

Meanwhile, Marca claim Atletico are in the market for a left back and could make a move for former defender Filipe Luis who left the Vicente Calderon for Chelsea in the summer. Porto's Alex Sanndro and Monaco's Layvin Kurzawa are also linked with Diego Simeone's side.

Ahead of the title run-in, AS believe Real Madrid have a 'favourable' fixture list compared to rivals Barcelona.

Both sides must face tricky tests against Sevilla and Valencia but Barcelona must also play Atletico Madrid away.

Over in Italy, Tuttosport claim Simone Zaza is close to a move to Juventus and say the Sassuolo frontman is looking for a home in Turin.

The Italian sports paper say Roma and Napoli are also interested in Zaza's signature but claim Juventus have been given the go ahead.
