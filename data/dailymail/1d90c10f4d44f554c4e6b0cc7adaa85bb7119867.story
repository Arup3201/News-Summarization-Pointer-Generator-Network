Risk: IKEA has recalled millions of 'SMILA' children lamps (pictured) after 17-month-old Daniel Madden, from Glasgow, choked on the light's cord and died

Furniture giant IKEA has recalled millions of children's lamps after a 17-month-old baby choked on the light's cord and died.

Daniel Madden, from Glasgow, became tangled up in the power cable of the lamp - part of the 'SMILA' series - after pulling it into his crib in October last year.

He was taken to the city's Royal Hospital for Sick Children, but could not be revived by doctors.

Daniel is not the only child to have been endangered by the product. Another 15-month-old baby was nearly strangled to death due to a similar incident.

Now IKEA has decided to recall the wall-mounted lamps - priced from £6 to £8 - which have been on sale in the store since 1999.

The lights, which are about 11 inches high and 11 inches wide, come in eight different designs.

These include blue star, yellow moon, pink flower, white flower, red heart, green bug, blue seashell and orange seahorse.

A staggering 23million of the items have been recalled worldwide - including almost three million in America, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.

The Swedish retailer - which is best known for its cut-price flat-pack furniture - has recalled a further 1.1million of the lamps in Canada.

It is believed that IKEA only became 
aware that the 'SMILA' lamp was involved in Daniel’s death in May, 
according to The Scottish Express.

A
spokesman told the newspaper: 'IKEA urges all customers with a "SMILA" 
wall-mounted lamp – or any corded wall-mounted lamp – to check 
immediately that the lamp and cord are out of reach of children when in a
cot or playpen and securely fastened to the wall.

Action: The Swedish retailer - which is best known for its cut-price flat-pack furniture - has recalled a staggering 23million of the lamps worldwide, including almost 3million in America and 1.1million in Canada

'IKEA reminds customers that any corded product such as a window covering or blind can present a strangulation hazard.'

Customers have been advised to stop using the lamp and to contact the retailer for a free repair kit.

They have also been told to look at the model name printed on a label - situated on the inside of the back of the lamp, near the light bulb - to find out if their item is involved in the recall. 

MailOnline has contacted IKEA for comment.
