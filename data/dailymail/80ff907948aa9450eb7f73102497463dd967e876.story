A 19-year-old teen who was allegedly driving drunk when he lost control  of his pick up and killed a college volleyball star who was in the passenger seat has been charged with homicide.

Ethan Kenney, of Dunbar, Pennsylvania, was 18 at the time of the crash that killed his friend, 19-year-old college volleyball star Catherine 'Cat' Healy

The two were driving on Ridge Boulevard in Dunbar Township about 4am on Sunday June 9 when the vehicle careered off the road and hit a guide rail and a tree.

Deceased: Star college volleyball player Catherine 'Cat' Healy, 19, was killed in a car crash in Dunbar Township, Pennsylvania, in June. The driver of the vehicle was now been charged with her murder

Murder charges: 19-year-old driver Ethan Kenney has been charged with homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence and other related charges in a June crash that killed college volleyball player Cat Healy

Scene: Ethan Kenney, a known wrestler at Connellsville Area High School, was only 18-years-old and allegedly intoxicated when he lost control of the pickup he was driving and hit a guide rail and tree, killing passenger Cat Healy

Healy was kept on life support for a day and a half but was legally declared brain-dead.

Kenney fled the scene after emergency medical personnel arrived but before police arrived.

He was located a short time later suffering minor injuries, with police saying they believed he was intoxicated but were awaiting toxicology results.

On Thursday Kenney was charged with homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence, accident involving death, driving under the influence of alcohol and nine summary offenses, all in connection with the crash, according to WTAE.

Kenney was a well-known wrestler at Connelsville Area High School.

Healy was a 2011 graduate of Connellsville Area High School and up for captain of the volleyball team at Penn State Behrend.

Rising star: Catherine Healy was expected to be made captain of the volleyball team at Penn State Behrend when classes resumed in August. She died in June

Relatives of the Lion's middle-hitter said that, thanks to organ donation, Healy's death saved the lives of five people.

'We made the decision about the organ donations pretty quick,' said Healy's father, George Appel.

The Center for Organ Recovery and Education (CORE) quickly prepared five recipients for Cat’s organs.

'It's the most selfless act that you could ever do, you know, is to share. To pass on,' said Appel.

'As hard as it is, you’ll be saving lives by passing on those organs.'

The lives of five people were saved by the death of Cat Healy, whose parents made the quick decision to donate eight of her organs

The family has reason to believe one of those recipients was 10-year-old Sarah Murnaghan, whose legal battle for an adult lung transplant changed the federal law.

In August a volleyball court at Mountz Creek Park, near Healy's high school, was named in her honor.

'Cat was absolutely beloved by her teammates and coaches,' said head coach Phil Pisano.

'She had such a kind spirit and beautiful soul, and brought tremendous joy and energy to our gym each day with her presence.

'Although this loss is devastating, we feel blessed to have been a part of her life and will carry forward with us her spirit and enthusiasm.'
