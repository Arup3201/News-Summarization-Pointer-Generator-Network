A 13-year-old boy who was cornered on an empty school bus,
bound with duct tape and sodomized with a pencil by three older students has
been bullied so intensely by his community for reporting the crime that his
family has had to move.

The incident, which occurred during a Norwood High School
wrestling trip in Denver, Colorado in February 2012, was reported to police by
the victim's father, then the K-12 principal and school football coach.

Charges were quickly filed against teens Hayden Harris, 14, and Talon Harris, 16, whose father, Robert Harris, was the school's wresting coach
and president of the school board, and their friend, Timothy Armintrout, aged 15.

The attackers later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges,
according to the Denver district attorney's office.

News spread quickly of the incident in the small ranching
town of Norwood, which is located near the Telluride ski resort and has just
500 residents.

But instead of condemning the heinous act, the community
rallied around the three star wrestlers claiming the incident was a case of
boys being boys.

The mother of one of the perpetrators even made T-shirts
supporting the attackers, with the slogan 'Team TTH' - the boys' first
initials.

Students, including the son of a Norwood High School
teacher, wore them at the Norwood Schools' annual end-of-the-year barbeque in
May 2012, until officials made them take them off.

Students also put 'Go to Hell' stickers on the victim's
locker.

The victim's father, who was allegedly advised against
reporting the assault to police by the school board and administrators, has
since resigned as principal. He has taken another job paying half his previous
salary in a town 200 miles away.

He says the bullying from the community aimed at his family
becameÂ  too much.

'Nobody would help us,' he told Bloomberg News. 'We
contacted everybody and nobody would help us.'

A spokeswoman for the Denver district attorney's office
added: 'There was a huge backlash, and everybody turned against this boy and
his family for bringing trouble to their town.'

The incident, which appeared to be an act of hazing,
happened on February 16 last year when the Norwood High School wrestling team
traveled to Denver to compete in the Colorado High School State Wrestling
Championship.

According to CBS4, while the other wrestlers who qualified
for the state tournament weighed in at Denver's Pepsi Center, the two ninth
graders, the eighth grader and the victim, a seventh grader, were left
unsupervised on a Norwood School bus.

The older boys then attacked the younger student, taping his
hands and ankles and assaulted him with the pencil.

Washparkphrophet.com reported that the victim's brother
heard the attackers laughing about the assault on his younger sibling and told
his father.

'I was shocked beyond belief, and I was mad,' the father
told the news website of learning about the attack. 'I do believe I was madder
than I have ever been. You're trying to protect your kids, and then something
like this happens.'

He said that he immediately confronted Robert Harris, the
wrestling coach, about the incident, who he says initially denied the attack
then justified it by claiming 'this happens 1,000 times a day around the U.S.'

According to CBS4, school officials discussed the
possibility of including the victim in the one-day, in-school suspension handed
down to his alleged assailants soon after the incident occurred. That was the
only punishment the school dealt.

One of the students pleaded guilty
to sexual contact without consent and the other two pleaded guilty to third
degree assault, Bloomberg reported. They were handed down varied sentences that included probation,
community service and restitution of about $2,500 each.

Robert Harris was reappointed as the school's wrestling
coach and was given a letter of reprimand for leaving students unattended on a
school bus, it was reported. However, he has since resigned from the role.

All three perpetrators returned to the scene of
the crime for this year's tournament in Denver.
