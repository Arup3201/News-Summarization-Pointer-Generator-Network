A 'major winter storm' could dump up to 12 inches of snow on Seattle in two days, weather experts are forecasting.

Chris Dolce, a meteorologist with weather.com, said the 
Northwest could take an even bigger pounding than the snowfalls that caused havoc at the weekend.

A low pressure system from 
the Gulf of Alaska is bringing the first major snowfall of the season to the
 Seattle area, and a major storm could dump more snow than the 9.4in of snow recorded in the 1985 blizzard, according the Mr Dolce.

Heavy snowfall in Seattle is rare, with a single-day snowfall of more than six inches occurring on only 14 days since 1948, and none since February 17, 1990.

Between December 12 and 25 in 2008, a foot of snow fell in the area, causing chaos in a city not used to clearing such large snowfalls.

Snowfall is now officially measured at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac). In November 21 and 22 1985, 9.4in was recorded there - a figure that could be broken in the coming days.

Seattle's record snowfall in one day is 20 inches, which fell on January 13, 1950.

From January 31 to February 2, 1916, 29 inches of snow fell in the area.

He predicted that travel by road or air could become 'dangerous or impossible' as the storm front moved in.

He said: 'Keep in mind, average annual snowfall is only 2.4 inches in Portland and
 5.9 inches in Seattle, so these amounts are very significant for these 
metro areas.

According to the National Weather Service in Seattle, snow amounts from this storm could exceed anything seen since 
November 1985 at Sea-Tac airport.'

The Mideast, meanwhile, was braced for a cold start to the week, with rain and snow on the way.
