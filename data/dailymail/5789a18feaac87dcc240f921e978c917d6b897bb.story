It's game over for San Francisco's iconic Candlestick Park. Where once Willie Mays, Barry Bonds, Joe Montana and so many more created magic memories for the city's sports fans in spite of it's famously blustery winds, heavy machinery is now taking the stadium apart piece by piece.

There is no room for sentiment for the demolition crew brought in after a successful public petition against more direct methods, such as dynamite and wrecking balls, extended the wait for the site's next incarnation as a $200million (£130m) urban outlet mall.

The mall will open some time in 2017, but the rich history of where it will stand is undeniable. Not just a previous home for the NFL's San Francisco 49ers and briefly the Oakland Raiders, along with baseball's Giants after their move from New York, it hosted what would be The Beatles' last full live concert.

Workers demolish a section of stadium seats inside Candlestick Park, San Francisco, once home to San Francisco's Giants and 49ers

The 'red zone' sign remains, for now, as The Stick is demolished in a process that is expected to take up to three months

The NFL's 49ers were the last professional franchise to call the park home having stayed there from 1971 to 2013

Orange chairs - the ones not sold to collectors for $649 a pair - are ruthlessly ripped from the stands by diggers and the turf torn up in a process that is set to take up to three months to complete.

Developer Lennar Urban, along with partner and mall-owner Macerich Corp, have plans in place for a 500,000-square-foot mall on a site that will also include 6,225 homes, 635,000 square feet of shops and 220 hotel rooms. 

Crew at the stadium wear orange but it's no homage to the Giants, just safety vests. The Loma Prieta earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter Scale on October 17, 1989, minutes before game three of the World Series was supposed to start, couldn't fell Candlestick Park. The stadium was credited with saving lives that day, with no one inside injured. But massive excavators are making short work of it.

Unimaginative but lasting catch phrases are a lasting legacy of 'The Stick', named after its Candlestick Point location in the Bayview Heights area on the west shore of San Francisco Bay

It's home to 'The Catch', the 1982 heroics of Dwight Clark, who clutched Montana's match-winning touchdown pass against the Dallas Cowboys to lead the 49ers to their first Super Bowl. It was the first of eight NFC Championship games there.

Candlestick Park was first opened in 1960 to be the home of San Francisco Giants baseball team after they moved from New York

Two more great plays are remembered as The Catch II and III - Terrell Owens' receipt of a Steve Young pass in the 1998 Wild Card round for a touchdown with eight seconds on the clock to beat the Green Bay Packers and Vernon Davis' grab from Alex Smith with nine seconds left for the win over the New Orleans Saints in the 2011 Divisional Playoffs.  

Originally opened in 1960, The Stick was built to be the home of Major League Baseball's San Francisco Giants and was the first 'modern' baseball stadium given it was built entirely from concrete.

With then US vice president Richard Nixon throwing out the first pitch on opening day, it was home to two MLB All-Star Games in 1961 and 1984 and the 1962 and 1989 World Series.

The Giants stayed until their move to Pacific Bell Park (now AT&T Park) in 2000, perhaps facing the also former New York-based side the  LA Dodgers  in the final baseball game there, leaving the 49ers as The Stick's sole occupants.

The 49ers' time there stretched from 1971 to 2013, before they went to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, with their final match there their 36th for Monday Night Football - the most of any ground. The 34–24 win over the Atlanta Falcons was dubbed The Pick At The Stick by pundits.  

It's not been confirmed whether there will be any remnants of The Stick once the development is complete, in the vein of Arsenal's former home at Highbury where the facade was retained at the front of apartments, but the memories will live on.
