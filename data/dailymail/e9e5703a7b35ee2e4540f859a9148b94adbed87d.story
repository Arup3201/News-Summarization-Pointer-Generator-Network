With LeBron James missing, the Oklahoma City Thunder cashed in to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 103-94 on Thursday night.

James sat out the game at the Chesapeake Energy Arena, Oklahoma with soreness in his left knee, and without him the Cavaliers’ eight-game winning streak came to an end.

Russell Westbrook led the Thunder to their fourth straight victory with 26 points while Kevin Durant added 19.

Cleveland put up a strong fight in James' absence and the game was tied 47 going into half time, but Oklahoma restricted the Cavaliers to just 19 third-quarter points to go into the fourth with a 78-66 lead.

Cleveland rallied in the final quarter to trim the deficit to three points with two minutes left on the clock, but Durant swung the momentum back to the Thunder with two straight baskets.

Meanwhile, James Harden scored 12 of his season-high 44 points in overtime as he led the Houston Rockets to a 113-109 win over the Sacramento Kings.
