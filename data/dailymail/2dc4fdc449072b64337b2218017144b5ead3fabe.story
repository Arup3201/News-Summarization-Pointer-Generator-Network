It has been a mad month for Silicon Valley's sex workers.

They were already in the spotlight after one of their most popular directories shut down. Now, a fellow worker is accused of injecting a Google executive with a fatal heroin hit.

But as the media descend on San Francisco, the most prominent insist Forrest Hayes' overdose does not reflect their industry, which remains booming as California floods with tech workers.

Media focus has turned to Silicon Valley's sex workers after Google executive Forrest Hayes died of an overdose. In one interview, with CNN, Maxine Holloway said it unfairly 'casts a shadow on the sex industry'

Thousands of prostitutes work in San Francisco, San Jose and the surrounding area, saying the relentless 
hours and high pay of young entrepreneurs makes them ideal clients.

Many sex workers are as tech-savvy - and as rich - as their clients.

With the highest earners claiming they can pull in $500 an hour, they advertise and campaign for their rights through Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, podcasts and even a newspaper column.

And fading are the days of standing on street corners, as a new clutch of mobile apps makes the industry more discreet.

Sex worker and activist Maxine Holloway told CNN she sees tech industry workers at least once a week.

'They're working really long, intense
 hours which is giving them that disposable income but along with that 
lifestyle it doesn't always leave room for traditional dating,' she said.

'So this mutually beneficial relationship with professional providers seems to work out really well. In the last six months business has been really good.'

Siouxsie Q, a sex worker who has more than 3,000 Twitter followers and runs a podcast called Whorecast, added to USA Today: 'I continue to see an increase in the amount of technology clients I see here in the Bay Area.'

The 28-year-old's website includes comic book-style illustrations, a blog and slogans including 'Winter is Coming' and 'Legion of Honor'.

She compared the influx of tech workers to the Gold Rush, saying: 'Anytime you have a lot of young men coming West to seek their fortunes, the sex worker industry responds.'

But despite many workers being proud of their work when they're on the web, it remains illegal in California, and many of the bloggers and Tweeters use assumed names.

San Francisco's police forces were 
called to 269 incidents of prostitution, soliciting or pimping last year, almost all of which 
ended in an arrest, according to data published by the City and County 
of San Francisco.

The most prominent are now speaking out after incidents which they say pose a threat to their work.

Dominating the headlines are the allegations faced by 26-year-old Alix Tichelman.

She is accused of injecting Google executive Hayes with a fatal dose of heroin before casually stepping over his body and leaving his 50ft yacht Escape in November.

Police said Tichelman, who was due to answer manslaughter, drug and prostitution charges today at the Santa Cruz County Superior Court, had many clients in Silicon Valley.

She is also now being re-investigated over the overdose death of her former 
boyfriend Dean Riopelle.

Speaking to CNN, which first documented the rise of sex workers in Silicon Valley last year, Ms Holloway said Hayes' death was bad for everyone in the industry.

'We think it's a really unfortunate 
situation and it definitely casts a shadow on the sex industry,' she said. 'I do 
worry that people are going to think this is something that's normal and
 happens very often, but in reality it doesn't.'

The other threat is the sudden closure of MyRedBook, an online directory with prostitutes said was a vital tool to keep them safe.

Last month the FBI shut down the escort site and a grand jury indicted its two alleged operators on charges including facilitating prostitution and money laundering.

Visitors to the site - which once included 'reviews' of prostitutes and a reference check system for clients which blacklisted predators - are now met with a message which alleges the FBI has 'cause to believe that this domain name was involved in money laundering derived from racketeering based on prostitution'.

In an angry blog post on the topic, Siouxsie Q wrote: 'Last month, thousands of Californians lost their jobs overnight. On June 25, I began getting frantic phone calls from friends and colleagues about the shutdown of the sex work advertising platform, MyRedbook.com.

'The loss of the website rocked the sex worker community in a way I had not yet seen in my career. Some began referring to it as "Hooker-pocalypse."

'With the end of the month fast approaching, sex workers had tuition, rent, and bills to pay, and many are still fearful that the shutdown of MyRedbook will be financially devastating for them.'

One worker, Patricia West, told SFGate:
 'Right now, everyone I know is noticing a pretty solid down-tick in how
 many new clients are contacting them because they're scared.

'I
 have the privilege to be able to turn down clients. I'm not desperate 
for money. But a lot of people don't have that ability and maybe have to
 see more dangerous clients.'

Despite many workers insisting they are not victims, attitudes are shifting in some quarters to seeing sex workers in the same bracket as, for example, victims of human trafficking.

In San Mateo, part of the Bay Area, police announced two weeks ago that they would stop treating sex workers as criminals.

Police Chief Susan Manheimer said: 'They are no longer considered suspects. We treat them as victims who require services, and really bring in victimsâ€™ advocates for them to build up some level of trust.'
