Military cadets have been banned from wearing uniforms on the streets in case they are targeted by terrorists.

Teenage Navy and Army cadets were told to either cover up their fatigues when walking to meetings or to change when they arrived.

Former soldiers said the order was ‘sad’ but acknowledged that fanatics intent on attack ‘would not see a child, they would just see a uniform’.

Defence chiefs sent out guidance 
nationally following the murder of soldier Lee Rigby, 25, who was hacked
to death in the street near his barracks in Woolwich, south-east 
London, last Wednesday. Drummer Rigby was wearing a Help for Heroes 
sweatshirt when he was killed.

Initial instructions from the Ministry of Defence to commanders said 
troops and cadets should be ‘advised to maintain a low public profile; 
uniforms should be concealed while in a public place, particularly when 
travelling alone or from home to unit’.

Prime Minister David Cameron contradicted the guidance the following day
when he insisted the ‘best way to defeat terrorism is to go about their
lives as normal’. But in a string of places – especially those with 
large Muslim populations – the leaders of cadet detachments are 
exercising caution.

Cadets in Blackburn, Accrington and Burnley have all been ordered not to
wear uniforms outside their bases. It is understood cadets in Bradford 
and Leeds have followed suit.

Mark Thompson, Officer in Charge of Accrington Sea Cadets – a town which
has an Asian population of 10 per cent – said they had been advised to 
take precautions by the Royal Navy.

He said: ‘The safety of the cadets is paramount and when it comes to 
children, basically it is “better safe than sorry”. Our detachment 
received an email from the Royal Navy advising our cadets to wear 
something on top to cover up their uniform when out and about. This is 
the advice we have passed on to our cadets.’

Marilyn Gregson, whose 16-year-old son Hadyn is in the Army Cadet Force 
in Blackburn – where 20 per cent of the town is Asian – said: ‘I am just
stunned that it has come to this.

‘While I am not sorry the cadets are taking precautions, you would 
think cadets could wear their uniform with pride in their own country. 
Though it is necessary, it is just awful that our cadets don’t feel safe
on the streets.’

Keith Shepherd, founder of soldiers’ charity Salute, said: ‘This sort of
precaution was common practice when I served in Northern Ireland and we
were not allowed to wear our uniforms on the streets.

‘A terrorist would not see a child, they would just see a uniform. It is a sad state of affairs.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘We have not issued any orders for cadets not to 
wear their uniforms – it is a matter for individual detachments to 
decide.’
