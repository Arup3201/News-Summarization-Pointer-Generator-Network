Former Arsenal striker Eduardo will sing both Brazil and Croatia's national anthems before the World Cup’s opening game.

The Brazilian-born Croatia forward will sing the song of his adopted nation, including the lyrics ‘tell the world that a Croat loves his homeland’ before switching to join in with the hosts’ own passionate verse proclaiming their ‘beloved homeland’.

Converted Croat: Brazilian born Eduardo will play for Croatia at the World Cup, but will sing both anthems before the teams clash in the first game of the tournament

The 31-year-old grew up in Brazil but spent much of the early years of his career in Croatia with Dinamo Zagreb before moving to Arsenal in 2007.

Eduardo’s mother Joelma said: ‘He has said he will sing two anthems. He is Croatian for work but in his heart he is still Brazilian.

‘In the family and community everyone is rooting for Eduardo da Silva, but after the first game everyone will be rooting for Brazil.’

Eduardo has 29 goals in 63 appearances for Croatia and may opt for a muted celebration should he score his 30th international goal against his country of birth.

Experienced: Eduardo has over 60 caps for Croatia dating back 10 years, and famously scored against England in a Euro 2008 qualifier in 2006

Former Gunner: Eduardo spent time at the Emirates Stadium between 2007 and 2010

His brother Bruno said: 'It’s the pinnacle of one’s career to play for the national team in your own country.

'Unfortunately this pinnacle will not be for Brazil but for another country – which does not take away the merit that comes with it.’

USA’s German manager Jurgen Klinsmann will also be singing two anthems in Brazil when his employers face the country he made 108 appearances for in Group G.

Klinsmann even went as far as to praise the ‘incredibly beautiful’ US anthem which he will belt out before kick-off on June 26.
