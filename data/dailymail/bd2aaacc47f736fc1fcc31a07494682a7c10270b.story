As the 2014 World Cup continues, Sportsmail will be providing you with all you need to know about every fixture in Brazil from team news and key battles to betting odds and Opta stats... Here is all the information you need for the first game in Group F between Argentina and Bosnia-Herzegovina

Venue: Estadio Jornalista Mario Filho, Rio de JaneiroKick-off: 11pm (7pm, Brazil time)TV coverage: BBC1, from 10.30pmOdds: Argentina 4/11, Draw 7/2, Bosnia-Herzegovina 17/2Referee: Joel Aguilar, El Salvador

Backing their boys: Argentina fans will hope to see their country win the World Cup in Brazil

Managers:  Alejandro Sabella (Argentina) and Safet Susic (Bosnia-Herzegovina)Key clash: Lionel Messi v Emir Spahic

The Barcelona forward scored in his first meeting with Spahic, when the defender played for Sevilla in 2011. Spahic, 33, will not even be able to just focus on Argentina’s talisman, with Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain joining the four-time Ballon d’Or winner to make up a potent front-three. One to watch: Angel di Maria (Argentina)

Outstanding for Real Madrid this season, di Maria’s role for his national side is equally important. Not only is the 26-year-old capable of gliding past defenders and chipping in with goals, he also has the discipline to track back and help his side defensively. This will be particularly important given Argentina’s potential weakness at the back. Head-to-head record: Played 2 Argentina Wins 2

Threat: Angel Di Maria could be one of Argentina's danger men 

Team News:

Lionel Messi takes centre stage in the World Cup on Sunday, facing Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Maracana with dreams of returning to the stadium for the final in four weeks' time.

Argentina arrive in Rio with expectations running high, not least that Messi will produce the kind of displays that were absent in South Africa four years ago.

Argentina have a wonderfully-talented attack, so much so that coach Alejandro Sabella could afford to leave Carlos Tevez out of his squad - but there are still question marks at the back, something readily admitted by Maradona, coach in 2010.

That attacking strength is however causing a dilemma for coach Sabella.

The coach has admitted that he favours a 5-3-2 formation - but he used a 4-3-3 set-up during the successful qualifying campaign, choosing not to squander his firepower.

However, there have been indications in training this week that he is going to be more conservative against Bosnia, which means Gonzalo Higuain missing out.

Much, of course, will depend on Messi but Bosnia coach Safet Susic's insists he has no plans to man-mark the four-times world player of the year.

This will be Bosnia's World Cup debut, indeed their first major tournament having only played the first match as an independent nation in 1995 following the civil war and break-up of Yugoslavia.

Argentina defender Federico Fernandez says they are acutely aware of the threat of Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko.
