United States women's goalkeeper Hope Solo has been suspended for 30 days by US Soccer over an incident during a training camp.

The governing body did not go into specifics over the incident but confirmed that the the 33-year-old would not be ineligible for the matches against France and England next month.

'U.S. Soccer has suspended goalkeeper Hope Solo from the U.S. Women's National Team for 30 days,' read a statement on www.ussoccer.com. 'The suspension is effective immediately.

'The suspension stems from an incident that occurred during the current WNT training camp being held in Carson, California.

'As a result of the suspension, Solo has been released from training camp and will miss the USA's matches in Europe on Feb. 8 in France and Feb. 13 in England.' 

The Seattle Reign stopper is no stranger to controversy and earlier this month had domestic violence charges against her dropped. Solo had pleaded not guilty.

She also failed a doping test ahead of the London Olympics in 2012 and was handed a public warning by the US Anti-Doping Agency after they accepted her explanation. 

Solo, 33,  was recently involved in a domestic violence case but had the charges against her dropped

'During our current National Team camp, Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on U.S. Soccer and her team-mates,' United States head coach Jill Ellis said.

'We feel at this time it is best for her to step away from the team.'

Solo issued an apology for her actions and pledged to come back ready ahead of this summer's World Cup in Canada.

'I accept and respect the Federation's decision, and more importantly, I apologise for disappointing my team-mates, coaches and the Federation who have always supported me,' read a statement on her official Facebook page.

'I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.' 

Solo's suspension means that she will miss the upcoming matches against France and England next month
