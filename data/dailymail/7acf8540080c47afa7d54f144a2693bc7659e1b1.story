Ford are 'looking into' the allegations

Ford motor company is facing accusations workers at a factory producing parts for its cars are subject to abusive and dangerous working conditions, a report said.

According to the National Labor Committee (NLC), Chinese workers at the Yuwei Plastics and Hardware Product Company in Dongguan work 14-hour days, seven days a week for just 80 cents an hour.

Shockingly, the report also alleges workers are forced to operate dangerous machines with safety measures turned off in order to speed up production.

Report: Ford Motor Company is looking into a graphic report by a human rights group alleging abuse of workers at a Chinese factory. This man's hand was mangled, allegedly by a machine at the factory

Factory: The report said the factory made 80 per cent of its parts for Ford

The report - 'Dirty Parts/Where Lost Fingers Come Cheap: Ford in China' - alleges a litany of abuses at the factory including a number of horrific injuries caused by deliberate safety short cuts.

One man named in the report, called Worker 'A' for his own protection, had three fingers and several knuckles torn from his left hand when it was trapped in a powerful punch press.

The 21-year-old told the NLC that  bosses at the factory told him to turn off an infra-red safety monitor device so he could work faster.

The monitoring 
device was designed to shut the machine off if a worker's hand 
went into the danger zone. 

The worker, who  'stamps' out 3,600 pieces a day, said: 'Some of the small parts could not be done with the infra-red monitoring on.

'We had to turn it off. My boss did not let me turn it on.'

Investigation: In a statement Ford said they were looking into the allegations

The Yuwei Plastics plant produces gear shifters and other small auto parts for
 a number of international car companies including Volkswagen and GM - 
although 80 per cent of their output is bought by Ford, the report 
alleges.

On its website the NLC says it reports on global workers rights and aims to, 'help defend the human rights of workers in the global economy.'

The report cited at least four other serious injuries involving maimed hands and fingers over several years.

'Minor' injuries, the report concludes, occur every one or two months - with seriously injured workers being 'fired after a year or two'.

Worker 'A' was said to have received only $7,430 in compensation for the loss of three fingers, leaving his hand basically inoperative.

The report compares this to the estimated $144,292 payment a U.S. worker would receive for the same injury.

Conditions: Safety equipment was said to have been turned off on dangerous machines so workers could produce more parts in less time

It was also reported that workers earned a base wage of just 80 cents an hour, while working 14-hour shifts, seven days a week.

The accusations echo a similar controversy faced by computer maker Apple and one of its suppliers.

Taiwan-based Foxconn, who manufacture parts for the iphone, suffered a spate of 10 suicides at its factory in Shenzhen, China, last year.

Poor working and boarding conditions along with an overworked labour force were blamed for the worker deaths.

A Ford spokesman said: 'We take these allegations seriously and are investigating the situation.

'Ford has a strong commitment to human rights and workplace safety, 
and we expect our suppliers to comply with local laws and our Code of 
Basic Working Conditions.'

He added that the company was still trying to determine if the 
Yuwei factory was one its 1,500 direct suppliers or one of thousands of 
indirect suppliers around the world.
