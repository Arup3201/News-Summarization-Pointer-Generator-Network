The parents of a baby girl delivered brain dead after a series of 'critical failures' by hospital midwives want health bosses to ensure lessons are learned so the 'same tragedy won't happen again'.

Imogen Skelcher suffered irreversible brain damage in the womb and her life support machine was switched off when she was just two days old.

She died in the arms of her parents Samantha Hewings and David Skelcher in March 2011.

The couple have been awarded a five figure sum after launching legal action against the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, following their daughter's death.

Legal firm Irwin Mitchell, which is acting for the parents, from Atherstone in Warwickshire, says the hospital trust has now settled the matter with an undisclosed payment to pay for grief counselling.

An
independent report found staff at the hospital had not followed 
guidelines, and failed to spot Imogen's heart rate was dangerously low.

Miss
Hewings, 27, suffered a ruptured uterus during the birth in March 2011,
and Imogen was eventually delivered by Caesarean section.

They already had a young son Jack born in 2009, and have since had another baby boy named Alfie.

Miss Hewings said: 'After I was induced and went into labour the pain was far worse than anything I had experienced.

'I knew something wasn't right. I was so distracted with the pain I didn't notice the heart monitor and how low Imogen's heart rate was dropping.

'As soon as I realised, I called a midwife and she notified a doctor and I was rushed for a caesarean section.

'Nothing can turn back the clock, but 
we just hope that the hospital trust has learned lessons so the same 
tragedy won't happen again.'

The trust offered its 'profound apologies for the failings in care provided' to the couple, saying lessons had been learned.

The report found staff had failed to identify the pregnancy as high risk despite Miss Hewings's first baby Jack being delivered by Caesarean.

It concluded staff had also failed to recognise and act on Miss Hewings's deteriorating condition, and failed to communicate the urgency of the situation, stating there had been a lack of communication throughout the labour and approved guidelines had not been followed.

The report recommended educating labour ward staff on heart monitoring, improving communication between midwives and doctors, more thorough note-taking and a tightening of guidelines for natural births following a C-section.

Imogen's parents later decided to donate their daughter's organs so others might avoid the trauma of losing a child.

Sara Burns, partner at Irwin Mitchell's, said: 'An independent report highlighted a series of critical errors made by midwives and included recommendations to ensure the same mistakes cannot be made again.

'It is absolutely vital that the trust now proves these recommendations have been implemented to give peace of mind to current and future patients that their safety is the top priority.'

A spokesman for the hospital said: 'George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust wishes to express its sincere condolences to the family and offers its profound apologies for the failings in the care provided.

'Several lessons have been learned as a result of this case and changes implemented to improve processes as a result.

'A legal claim has been presented by the family and a settlement has been agreed between the parties. It would be inappropriate for the Trust to comment further.'
