'She's convulsing': The 911 call made from Demi Moore's home on Monday night has been released

A tape of a 911 call that was made from Demi Moore's home the night she was rushed to hospital has been released.

In the recording, a panicked female caller can be heard saying: 'She smoked something. It's not marijuana, but it's similar to incense.

She added that Demi was 'convulsing' and 'semi-conscious, barely.'

The caller said: 'She's been having some issues lately with some other stuff, but I don't know what she's been taking or not.'

When asked by the operator if the apparent overdose was accidental or intentional, the caller said: 'Well, she smoked something but the reaction was accidental.'

A second woman gets on the phone and says, 'She's shaking, convulsing, burning up. I'm taking cold water and putting it on her back because she's burning up.'At one point, the woman can be heard saying: 'Demi, can you hear me? Yes, she's squeezing my hand. She can't speak. She's convulsing so we're holding her down.'

By the end of the call, a male caller takes the phone and says Demi is 'much calmer...she's breathing fine. She's leaning up and talking quietly.'

Demi's eldest daughter Rumer, 23, is believed to have been at home at the time of the star's collapse.

During the early stages of the 911 call, a female can be heard saying: 'What is the address Ru?'

Radar Online speculates Demi may have been smoking K2 or Spice, which is a legal herbal and chemical product that mimics the effects of cannabis.

Back in town: Demi's estranged husband Ashton Kutcher touched down at LAX after a trip to Brazil

Personal details about the 
49-year-old's medical condition and medications were omitted by the Los 
Angeles Fire Department in order to comply with federal medical privacy 
laws and at the insistence of the Los Angeles City Attorney's office.

The
emergency call was placed after the actress had inhaled nitrous oxide, 
also known as 'whip-its', is has been claimed in US reports.

Meanwhile, Ashton Kutcher is now back in Los Angeles after his trip to Brazil.

The
Two and a Half Men actor - who split from the actress in November amid 
allegations he had cheated on her - was out of the country when his 
estranged wife was taken to hospital on Monday to be treated for 
'exhaustion'.

Flying back 
from his stint at Sau Paulo Fashion Week last night, Ashton is said to 
be 'concerned' but still 'moving on' from the relationship.

Emergency: The star was rushed to Sherman Oaks Hospital but has since been discharged

A source told People magazine: 'Ashton is deeply concerned for Demi. He still cares about her and wants the best for her.'

'He still cares about her. But their marriage is ending and they are both moving on.'

It has now been claimed the mother-of-three - who is reported to be receiving treatment for eating disorder anorexia - had replaced food with caffeine-based energy drink Red Bull.

A friend of the star told The Sun newspaper: 'Demi avoids alcohol and instead drinks tons of Red Bull when she goes out. But in recent months she's not been eating much, so she's also been drinking it in the day to give her energy to get through.'

Demi - who was reportedly released from California's Sherman Oaks Hospital last night - 'seemed drunk' when she was admitted to the medical facility on Monday, but it is thought it was just because of the vast quantities of Red Bull she had consumed.

The pal added: 'She seemed drunk but I don't think any alcohol passed her lips, just loads of Red Bull. It's not a healthy way to live.'

Demi left hospital yesterday and is understood to be recovering at home.
