A huge former container ship will this week begin the unprecedented and complicated task of destroying the deadly chemical weapon stockpile handed over by Syria's president Bashar al-Assad.

The vessel will be accompanied by armed guards throughout the six-stage journey that take its cargo of nerve agents and mustard gas from Syria to Finland via a mafia-plagued port in southern Italy.

The final consignment left the Syrian port of Latakla for Calabria in Italy last week, meaning - officially at least - Assad no longer has any chemical weapons in the country.

The ship carrying out most of the decommissioning is the American-owned Cape Ray, which will be loaded up with 700 tons of the most dangerous chemicals ever taken to sea.

The material has been transported in small amounts to Gioia Tauro in Calabria, southern Italy - a large port which is regularly used by the notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia to smuggle shipments of drugs and weapons into Europe.

The presence of the chemical weapons will be of little interest to the criminal organisation, however, as the Cape Ray - onto which the Syrian material is being loaded - is so heavily guarded.

Now that the vessel is fully loaded, it will begin making its way into undisclosed international waters where the process of destroying the worst of the chemical weapons will begin.

According to the Independent, the Cape Ray has two titanium-lined reactors which can work 24 hours a day, six days a week for up to three months breaking the chemicals down.

By the end of the process, some of the most hazardous material known to mankind will be reduced to little more than 1.5million gallons of relatively harmless industrial waste.

This material will then make be transported on Norwegian and Danish vessels to northern European countries - including Britain, Germany and Finland - where it can easily be disposed of safely.

Although the removal of the material means Syria is officially free of chemical weapons, a number of observers claims Assad's forces are still using chlorine gas against rebel forces.

Unsubstantiated reports from doctors and medical staff within the country suggest pro-government forces may be using crude but barrel bombs to deploy the deadly chlorine gas - which was developed as a weapon during the First World War.

While the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been unable to confirm its use, one expert has little doubt Assad has been deploying chlorine gas.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of British chemical-weapons forces and head of specialist security compnay SecureBio told The Independent: 'In my opinion, Assad sees that chemical weapons have a battle-winning 
ability and, no matter how crude chlorine gas is, it still has the power
 to terrify.'

Once complete, the operation to destroy Assad's chemical weapon will have involved more than 30 countries - some of which are dealing with the decommissioning and disposal of the waste, while others are merely providing transportation, or allowing the Cape Ray to safe passage through their waters.

Britain's involvement in the operation will see material totalling 150 tons processed and incinerated at Veolia Environmental Services plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.

The Foreign Office insists this material will not include dangerous chemical weapons, and will instead be relatively harmless waste material.
