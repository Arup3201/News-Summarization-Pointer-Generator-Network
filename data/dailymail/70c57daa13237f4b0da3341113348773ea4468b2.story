The conclusion of a football match, particularly monumental ones like the World Cup final, often brings new debate and inquiry, questions about players, tactics and refereeing decisions. 

Very rarely do they result in a government investigation. Yet that is exactly what happened after Brazil's capitulation in the 1998 final against hosts France.

Quite what transpired in the hours before the match, particularly with star player Ronaldo who was taken to hospital and left off the teamsheet only to be reinstated before kick-off, is one of football's most enduring mysteries.

Civil action in a Rio court, a Rio medical council action against two team medics (both of whom were unanimously absolved of blame) and an investigation in Brazil's national congress have shed some light on the events of  July 12 1998 but it continues to be a source of consternation in the country. 

The official records show the match ended in a 3-0 defeat for Brazil but the story of what happened in and around the Stade de France that afternoon is murkier in detail.

Ronaldo, then just 21, had been outstanding all tournament in a Brazil side - including Cafu, Roberto Carlos and Bebeto - that were defending their title from 1994. 

The final was billed as a head-to-head between him and France's equally captivating talisman Zinedine Zidane. In the event, the France midfielder steamrollered a jaded Brazil outfit, scoring two first half headed goals in a man of the match performance with Emmanuel Petit adding a third after a late counter-attack. 

It was the first time France had been crowned world champions but it later transpired much of the drama had already happened, out of view of the many millions of TV viewers worldwide.

The day had began in a relaxed fashion for the Brazil players. The whole squad had lunch at the Chateau de Grande Romaine, just outside Paris then returned to their rooms. Ronaldo was sharing with Roberto Carlos, neighbouring a room with Edmundo and Doriva.

Roberto Carlos implied Ronaldo was wilting under the weight of expectation of the nation. 'He was scared about what lay ahead,' he said, 'The pressure had got to him and he couldn't stop crying.'

To government congress later, Edmundo described a viscerally shocking scene as suddenly Ronaldo started to have a fit. He frothed at the mouth and began to shake uncontrollably. Roberto Carlos, overwhelmed by panic, started screaming for help. 'When I saw what it was, I despaired,' said Edmundo, 'Because it was a really strong and shocking scene.' He ran through the hotel hitting on all the doors and shouting for everyone to come.

A congressmen asked the striker for more details. 'Was Ronaldo hitting out or shaking?'

'Hitting out a lot,' replied Edmundo.

'Lying down?'

'Lying down and hitting himself with his hands like this, with his teeth...'

'Together?'

'Locked together and with his mouth foaming.'

'His whole body hitting itself?'

'The whole body, yes.'

Defender Cesar Sampaio put his hand in Ronaldo's mouth to unravel his tongue and prevent him swallowing it. Ronaldo then fell asleep and, according to Edmundo, team doctors decided to pretend that nothing had happened when he woke up.

Ronaldo woke up and went for tea. But he was subdued. Leonardo, one of the side's senior players at the time, insisted that Ronaldo be told what had happened and the doctors relented.

At 6pm when the squad began the short coach journey to the Stade de France, Ronaldo went to the Lilas clinic in Paris. 

His name was left off the teamsheets, sending the assembled international press into frenzy but 40 minutes before kick-off he arrived after being given the all-clear and insisted he should play.

Brazil's miserable showing on the pitch led to outrage in the country and rumours began to swirl about wrongdoing in the camp in the lead up to the match and even conspiracy. 

Manager Mario Zagallo was criticised for picking Ronaldo despite what had happened but he defended his decision.

'If you invert the situation and I didn't put Ronaldo on and then Brazil lost 3-0, people would say 'Zagallo is stubborn, he had to put him on, Ronaldo was the best player in the world.' So I think I would do the same again. Now was it his being chosen that caused Brazil to lose? Absolutely not. I think it was the collective trauma, created by the atmosphere of what had happened.'

Understandably Ronaldo, who continued to play for Brazil until 2011, tried to downplay the affair throughout his career. Last year, in a TV interview with Gary Lineker as his country prepared to host the World Cup, he lifted the lid on what had happened. He told the story of the fit and revealed he begged the manager to let him play.

'I had a convulsion, after lunch in the afternoon. I was unconscious for three or four minutes. I don't know why. Nobody knows. Was it pressure or nerves? It could be,' he said, 'When you are there and you breathe the competition, everything is about the competition. You cannot disconnect from it. It's a lot of pressure. But I pleaded with Zagallo to let me play.'

Ronaldo went on to lift the World Cup with Brazil in Japan four years later and will go down as one of the great strikers of all time, but an air of intrigue continues to hang over that afternoon's events.
