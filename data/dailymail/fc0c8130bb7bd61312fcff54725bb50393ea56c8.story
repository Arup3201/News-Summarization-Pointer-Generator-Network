Coleen Rowntree told a hearing that the bullying had a major impact on her health

A lesbian forklift truck driver has been awarded £7,500 damages after her boss bombarded her with pornography and made crude comments about her sex life.

Coleen Rowntree won a discrimination claim after relief chargehand Steven Evans repeatedly switched on the Babe Channel at work and asked her about sex.

She told an employment tribunal that Mr Evans continually made remarks about her sexuality when she was the only woman on the Knauf shopfloor at night.

She said: 'He nearly always puts the Babe Channel programme on the television showing women’s private parts and makes digs and comments about it to me often with an audience.'

Ms Rowntree, 47, told the hearing he made rude comments while watching the TV show relating to her sexual activity with her female partner and asked what she would do with the women on the telly.

She said: 'It showed women and women having sex as well as men and women having sex.'

He asked what sex toys she used and if she would be having sex at the weekend.

When a potential employee was being shown round Ms Rowntree said Mr Evans could not make out if it was a 'lad or a lass.'

He asked her 'is she one of you then?' and when Ms Rowntree inquired what he meant he replied 'bats for the other side.'

Ms Rowntree said he repeatedly called her a 'd***head' on the radio and that 'a Lottery win for the claimant would be a win for him because she would leave.'

When another worker said he had something for Ms Rowntree in his car Mr Evans replied: 'I hope it is a noose.'

She also said Mr Evans called another male employee, who was not homosexual, 'gay boy' or 'Phyllis' which she thought was a dig at her.

The Leeds tribunal partly upheld her complaint of discrimination on the grounds of her sexual orientation and awarded her damages for injury to feelings.

They said having to watch the Babe Channel show and suffer comments from Mr Evans was 'unwanted' conduct.

'It had the effect of violating her dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating and offensive environment for the claimant,' said Employment Judge John Trayler.

Ms Rowntree, from Grimsby, made her claim against building materials supplier Knauf UK earlier this year.

She told a remedy hearing that the bullying had a major impact on her health.

'I was going through hell,' she said. 'The pressure Steve was putting me through left me suicidal. If I had got a gun I would have shot him.'

She was happy in the job but had problems with Mr Evans. 'I lived with a woman. I’m gay. I was taunted for a long time. I was bullied by a bloke for my sexuality.'

The agency worker quit Knauf in April, 2011 after working at the Immingham site for more than two years when she said she could take no more and was then sacked for smoking, which was against company policy.

Ms Rowntree claimed her long-term partner later walked out on her because of her troubles at work.

She would go home and break down and relate what she was going through to her partner. 'She was the one taking it all. If she had been a fella she would have sorted him out at the gate,' she said.

She had been left 'heartbroken and hysterical' at the split in February, 2012 and tried to hang herself.

'I felt dirty, distressed and belittled for being gay,' she said.

'I began to worry about my sexuality. I realised I was gay in my late teens but I began to think that I should find a boyfriend and be like everyone else.

'I was going downhill fast.'

Her solicitor Rob Childe told the hearing: 'This strikes at the heart of her identity. She didn’t want to talk about being a lesbian with her work colleagues. She was made to feel ashamed of her sexuality.'

He said despite an internal investigation the perpetrator Mr Evans had gone unpunished.

Nick Cooksey, for the company, said Ms Rowntree had not referred to her relationship breakdown in her initial statement to the tribunal and there was no evidence to say it was because of events at work.

Despite visiting her GP she had not complained about her problems at work and she got another job within a month of leaving Knauf.

'There was a culture of banter and strong exchanges at work and she gave as good as she got,' he said.

A spokesman for Knauf said: 'Knauf seeks to maintain the highest standard of conduct and considers equality and diversity to be an important element of its business.

'We have a hardworking and loyal workforce at Knauf with no finding of any discrimination complaints prior to this issue in 2011 or subsequently.

'Although many of the complaints made by Coleen Rowntree were not upheld we regret that the Tirbunal found evidence of sexual orientation discrimination.

'The company has ensured all lessons learnt will enable us to continue to provide a free workplace free from discrimination.'

Lawyers for the company said they did not accept that she was bombarded with pornography, and that he only allegedly made some comments while watching a non-subscription adult channel on a handful of occasions.
