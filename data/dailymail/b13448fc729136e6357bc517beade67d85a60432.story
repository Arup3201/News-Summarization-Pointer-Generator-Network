When Nikki Stanley, 46, went to the dentist to have her crowns replaced, she certainly didn't expect to be left with no upper teeth at all.

But that is exactly what happened and six years later, Ms Stanley says she is still too embarrassed to leave the house.

'I had never been embarrassed about how my teeth are,' says the learning support assistant from London.

Recluse: Nikki Stanley was aghast when she realised a bungling dentist had removed all of her upper teeth

Embarrassing: She says her teeth made her so self-conscious, she loathed leaving the house 

'Not until the age of 40 when I thought I was going in to get my teeth done and a couple of crowns fitted and ended up with no teeth.'

So afraid of the dentist is Ms Stanley now, she was too frightened to get help when she began experiencing problems with her bottom teeth - and now has just five left in total.

Her ordeal began six years ago when a routine procedure was badly bungled. 'When I came round back at home in my bed, I was horrified,' she says, wiping away a tear.

'I thought I was going to wake up with my teeth crowned or at least my teeth filed down ready to have the crowns fitted the next week but instead, she'd just removed my teeth.'

The dentist had given her a dental plate but Ms Stanley says she wasn't told how to use the device and says wearing it is 'alien' to her. 

Now Ms Stanley is so self-conscious about her unsightly teeth, she is afraid to leave the house - a problem made worse by cruel bullies who insult her looks in the street.

'I'm on borrowed time, borrowed time,' she says. 'I have five teeth left and it t has really affected my life. 

'I don't go out. I'm just happier staying at home. The one time I stop thinking about my appearance and what I look like is when I'm in my garden, gardening.

'I just enjoy it because I don't have to interact with anyone. I don't have to put my hand in front of my mouth when I'm talking to my plants. 

'I haven't really got any quality of life to speak of. I'm happier at home than I am going out because I haven't got to face people.'

Her son Nathan is horrified by the change in his formerly bubbly mother. 'The last time I went out with my mum was on my 16th birthday,' he says. 'It's been a long time. 

'I'm not going to live with my mum forever,' he continues. 'I'd love to see her happy.'

'I've basically been told that I'm a mess,' adds Ms Stanley. 'I've been told that I'm an embarrassment. 

'Once someone says that to you, where do you go from there?  There's nowhere else to go.'

Although her son would like her to meet a new man and be happy, Ms Stanley says her hopes were dashed by the botched procedure.

'I'm single and I can't imagine meeting anyone or being with anyone like that,' she says. 'Who'd want to be with someone like me? I haven't got a life. I exist but I don't live.'

Big improvement: Ms Stanley has now had all her teeth replaced with implants - and is much happier

But there is light at the end of the tunnel for Ms Stanley, after she was offered a reconstruction operation by Harley Street surgeon, Dr Anthony Zybutz.

Dr Zybutz, who specialises in tooth implants, was forced to remove her remaining teeth and remove rotten stumps from her upper gums but, after eight hours in surgery, successfully completed the operation.

A delighted Ms Stanley says the surgery has been life-changing. 'It's unbelievable,' she beams. 'It's just nice to go out and hold my head up and smile and not look down when people look at me. 

'It was kill or cure for me. I'm so much happier now that at the end of the day, my cheeks hurt from smiling so much.'

Son Nathan is similarly pleased. 'Since the surgery, my mum has been happy in herself,' he says, adding cheekily: 'She now spends a lot of time looking in the mirror smiling at herself.'

'There's nothing to stop me doing anything now,' adds Ms Stanley. 'Having the surgery has just changed my life. It really has.'
