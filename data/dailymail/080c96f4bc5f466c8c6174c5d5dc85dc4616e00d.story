The ex-wife of the boss of a major rose breeding firm killed a teacher while drunk at the wheel – but was spared jail after a judge heard she suffered from depression.

Francine Austin, 54, ploughed her Audi convertible into Brenda Wilson, 62, killing the primary school teacher instantly.

She also hit Deirdre McFadden, 48, who was walking her dog with Mrs Wilson, after her car left the road and 'headed directly towards the pavement'.

Mrs McFadden escaped with arm injuries. Her dog was killed.

Austin, whose ex-husband David runs David Austin Roses, admitted causing death by careless driving while over the legal alcohol limit.

Judge John Maxwell said he would have normally sentenced her to a three-year prison term.

But despite 'considerable reservations' he felt he had 'no alternative' but to make an indeterminate hospital order, based on psychiatric reports.

The decision to spare Austin jail was greeted with outrage by Mrs Wilson's family. Speaking outside the court, Mrs Wilson's son Edward Davies said the sentence was an 'absolute disgrace'.

He added: 'She's got submissions from two psychiatrists saying that she shouldn't go to prison, we dispute what they're saying.

'I think she should serve the full 
prison sentence after the doctors let her out, but she'll probably only 
do a year in the hospital and be let out. If you've got money you can 
pay for expensive psychiatric reports. Money talks.'

Stafford Crown Court heard Austin had 
drunk four glasses of wine the night before taking her daughter to a 
music festival last August.

But she was still more than one and a half times the legal alcohol limit when she crashed on the way back.

Mrs Wilson was walking with Mrs McFadden, and her dog on a pavement beside the country road at Stourton, South Staffordshire.

Robert Price, prosecuting, said: 'A 
witness noticed that the Audi was travelling up its correct side of the 
road but didn't appear to be travelling the natural course of road.

'He believed that there was something 
wrong with the way in which the car was being manoeuvred. It veered from
its natural course, headed directly towards the pavement as if it was 
what the driver intended.'

When police breathalysed Austin, a 
mother of three, she had 54mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath – well over
the legal limit of 35mg.

Andrew Fisher QC, defending, said 
Austin was on anti-depressants at the time and had recently undergone a 
three-month spell in a psychiatric hospital.

He added: 'She is ill, and as with any
offender before any court they have to be dealt with within the regime 
that relates to that.'

Austin was sent to the independent 
Woodbourne Priory hospital in Birmingham, which specialises in treating 
mental health problems. Judge Maxwell told her: 'The position is that 
you should not go to prison but that you should be detained in a mental 
hospital.

'I have considerable reservations 
about that because you are mentally ill but I look at the trauma other 
people have suffered and I don't know that makes them mentally ill.

'Why should your mental suffering make so much difference to  the case?

'You do not deserve leniency, but I feel I really have no alternative but to make a hospital order.'

Austin was also banned from driving for five years after her release.
