Sugar Puffs (pictured in their current form) will be being rebranded as 'Honey Monster Puffs' and will contain less sugar and 20 per cent more honey

Sugar Puffs are being given a makeover in an attempt to address parents' concerns about the amount of sugar in the cereal - and revive plunging sales.

Rebranded as 'Honey Monster Puffs' after the yellow furry  character featured in previous adverts, they will be made from a new recipe with less sugar and 20 per cent more honey.

The cereal will also feature traffic light nutritional labelling on the front of the pack, in a move manufacturers Halo Foods said would allow customers to make 'informed decisions' about what they eat for breakfast.

Overall, manufacturers say the sugar content has been reduced by a third in a decade.

Honey Monster Puffs will contain 8.6g of sugar – a cube and a half – in a 30g portion, down from the previous recipe which contained almost two cubes per portion.

However critics say the move is largely a marketing ploy - as once broken down, honey and added sugar become the same thing - glucose. 

Dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline: 'Added sugar and honey are grouped in the same category by the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.

'Although honey is seen as more "natural" than added sugar, it is still counted as a "free sugar" - i.e. one that has been added to a product rather than say lactose, a sugar found naturally in milk.

'Once broken down in the body, honey will do exactly the same thing as the added sugar would have.'

In comparison to Sugar Puffs, Coco Pops and Frosties contain 11g of sugar per portion - more than two cubes.

Tesco Chocco Snaps contain 9.8 g of sugar (almost two cubes), and Kellogs Krave contains 9g.

Readybrek Chocolate has 6g of sugar in each portion - just over one cube - but Readybrek original contains no sugar at all.

Cheerios similarly contain 6g of sugar for each 30g and Rice Krispies contain 3g of sugar per portion, just over half a cube.

Breakfast cereals have faced a backlash in recent years, with critics claiming products with a high sugar content are being dressed up as a healthy option.

In 2012 an investigation by Which? Found that Sugar Puffs were the third most sugary breakfast cereal marketed towards children.

The Honey Monster is being revived as part of a £3 million marketing campaign in 2015 to advertise the products, after a backlash against breakfast cereals with a high sugar content

Such products are laden with so much sugar they ought to be sold alongside chocolate biscuits, not marketed as a recipe for a healthy life, investigators said.

In June shadow health secretary Andy Burnham announced that a Labour government would cap the amount of sugar in breakfast cereals in a bid to tackle childhood obesity.

Honey Monster Puffs will contain 8.6g of sugar – a cube and a half – in a 30g portion, down from the previous recipe which contained almost two cubes per portion.

Comparably, Coco Pops and Frosties contains 11g of sugar per portion, more than two cubes.

Tesco Chocco Snaps contains 9.8 g of sugar (almost two cubes), and Kellogs Krave contains 9g.

Readybrek Chocolate has 6g of sugar in each portion - just over one cube - but Readybrek original contains no sugar at all.

Cheerios similarly contained 6g of sugar for each 30g and Rice Krispies contained 3g of sugar per portion, just over half a cube.

The move came after the World Health Organisation announced adults should halve their average intake to six teaspoons a day (almost five cubes) to avoid obesity, heart disease and other serious illnesses.

Halo Foods is planning a £3 million marketing campaign in 2015 to further drive sales of the new product, centered around the return of the Honey Monster, The Grocer magazine reported.

They are hoping to tap into nostalgia for the furry yellow character, who was first seen on screens in 1976.

Andy Valentine, Marketing Director at Halo Foods, said: 'The Honey Monster was a staple of family breakfasts for decades. 

'Our research has shown us that consumers still have a strong feeling of nostalgia, trust and loyalty towards him, so it's fantastic that we're able to bring him back.'

He added: 'Despite a lack of investment for the last few years under previous owners, Honey Monster Puffs has maintained a position as the number 18 brand in the UK cereal category.

'We feel that the product re-launch, coupled with our move to bring the product name in line with the iconic Honey Monster character, can only amplify this position and help grow our share of the cereals category.'
