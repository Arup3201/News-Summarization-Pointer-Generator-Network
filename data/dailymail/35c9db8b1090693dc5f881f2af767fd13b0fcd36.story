Spain and Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara has been ruled out of the World Cup after suffering a setback in his recovery from a knee injury.

Bayern revealed that Thiago suffered a recurrence of the ligament tear in his right knee last Monday and will undergo an operation soon.

The club said it's 'not possible' for the 23-year-old to play in Saturday's German Cup final against Borussia Dortmund. And he won't be ready for the World Cup either.

Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says, 'It's bitter for Thiago. We're sorry for the guy.

'A young lad who's been working on his comeback and on the World Cup in the land of his father, and suddenly both dreams are shot.'

Thiago originally suffered the injury in Bayern's 3-3 draw with Hoffenheim on March 29.
