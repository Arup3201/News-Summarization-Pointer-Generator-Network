Brazil legend Romario claims Brazilian football is being ruined by ‘talentless moguls’ in an extraordinary outburst.

The former Brazil forward, who won the World Cup with his country in 1994, believes the tournament has been shamed by their 7-1 semi-final defeat against Germany on Tuesday.

Romario, who was writing on his Facebook page, is now an MP and has been campaigning for greater accountability for the massive expense to stage the World Cup in Brazil.

He said: ‘Yesterday was a very sad day for our football. Those with good memories will remember my words: “Off the field, we have already lost the World Cup”.

‘Sadly it was no different on the field. There is a crisis in our beloved sport. You think the problem is only the players or (coach Luiz Felipe) Scolari? No way. 

‘Our football has been deteriorating for years, being sucked dry by talentless moguls.

‘Dilma will have to present the cup to another team. They will take the cup and we will be left with our overpriced stadiums and no material legacy. This is the cup of shame.’

Brazil defender Dani Alves, who was dropped from the quarter-final and semi-final team, claimed the side can ignore the cheap shots.

He said: 'I know a lot of life’s losers and a**holes will make fun. But I would like to say publicly that I am privileged to be part of this group - you are the best, you are champions, you are what all these a**holes will never be, because you have excelled and succeeded in life.

'Bad days comes into our lives and they help you learn to appreciate the good days.'
