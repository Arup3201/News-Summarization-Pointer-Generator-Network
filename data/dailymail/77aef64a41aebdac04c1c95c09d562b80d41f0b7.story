Lewis Holtby has thanked Fulham for his opportunity on loan and believes the potential of the young players at Craven Cottage will help the response to relegation from the Barclays Premier League.

Germany midfielder Holtby had a limited impact on loan from Tottenham, playing 13 games, scoring once, but insisted he 'cried with the club' when the Cottagers' demotion to the Championship was confirmed at Stoke, ending their 13-year top-flight stay.

'It was fantastic to play for this club and they will always stay in my memories,' Holtby said on the club's official website.

'Even though we went down I had a fantastic time here. I cried with the club when we went down and Fulham will always be a part of me.

'The fans took to me and I took to them. I'm a person who plays with passion and desire.

'When you play for a club, even on loan, you have to give 100 percent dedication, you can't just go and take the money.

'You have to play football with heart and the Fulham fans deserve that.'

Fulham reached the FA Youth Cup final, losing in agonising fashion to neighbours Chelsea, and Holtby believes youth can provide the foundation for future success.

'This club has a brilliant academy,' he said.

'A fresh start can see a lot of young blood come in and that can only bode well for the future.'
