For 26 years, Rebecca Vary trudged on through each day as her body broke down beneath her.

It wasn't until last year that the now 43-year-old business owner, from Perth in Western Australia, was finally diagnosed with Lyme disease by a doctor that was too afraid to treat her.

'I had a lot of symptoms that were vague and would reappear and disappear for a bit - a lot of things that weren't quite right that I couldn't put my finger on. Then in 1994 I became so fatigued that I couldn't leave my room or bed,' Ms Vary told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's a debilitating fatigue, to the point where you have to make a choice of, "do I do my hair or have a shower? Because there's no way I can do both if I have to get to work today".

About 300,000 Australians are estimated to be living with Lyme disease, which occurs in humans who are bitten by ticks and insects that are infected with Borrelia bacteria

'I was told I had virus and that's why I was so tired. I'd seen between 12 to 17 doctors for various things that arose over the years and none of them picked it up. A lot of doctors kept saying that, because there was nothing in my blood – but they would just be checking my iron and sugar levels.'

The Lyme Disease Association of Australia estimates that about 300,000 Australians are currently living with the bacteria borne illness. It occurs in humans who are bitten by ticks and insects that are infected with the Borrelia bacteria.

Sharon Whiteman, the president of the association, told Daily Mail Australia that Lyme disease is a 'hidden epidemic'; despite many Australians presenting symptoms, the illness continues to be dismissed by the government and medical practitioners across the country.

'They have been having trouble isolating the organism in the lab and a very prestigious group did a big study in 1994 that did not find Borrelia in Australian ticks, and so a very blanket statement was made that there is no Borrelia in Australia,' Ms Whiteman said.

Many sufferers, like Maddie  Bridgman, are referred to psychologists as the Australian government does not recognise that the infectious disease can be caught in Australia

As a result, many Australians suffering from Lyme disease, like Ms Vary, are told that their pain is all in their head.

'They would ship me off to psychiatrists who just kept saying "I don't know why they keep sending you to me",' she said.

'You just start to realise, well actually medicine and doctors aren't any help to you and you just have to live as best you can.'

Similarly, Maddie and Dean Bridgman, from North Sydney, told Channel Seven's Sunday Night how they were repeatedly turned away by medical practitioners who insisted Mrs Bridgman's sudden seizures and inability to walk were due to a psychological problem.

'The top neurologist in Sydney said "it's all in your head, go away",' Mr Bridgman said.

'It's hard to have a nurse yell at your wife and say, "you're making this up, stop shaking," when you know that there's something wrong, when you know that it's not all in her head.'

It wasn't until May last year that Mrs Bridgman, who was suffering 11 seizures a day and had been turned away by three doctors and three hospitals, found out that she had Lyme disease when her blood was sent to the US for testing.

With doctors in Australia unable to treat the illness as the testing methods and results are not officially recognised, patients like Ms Vary and Mrs Bridgman are being forced to travel as far as Germany to be treated.

Both women attended Klinik St George hospital in Bad Aibling where they received scientifically unproven hypothermia treatment – a procedure in which an artificial fever is stimulated by heating the patient's body to up to 41.7 degrees.

After spending $55,000 on the controversial treatment, Mrs Bridgman can not only walk again, but has resumed studying her nursing degree.

Ms Vary, who has suffered from Lyme disease since the age of 17, has also noticed life changing improvements after undertaking multiple treatments at two different German clinics and another in Indonesia.

'I can stand up in a queue in a supermarket now - I couldn't do that before I went to Germany. I can walk now, I can do daily tasks, I couldn't hold conversation for a long time, I hadn't had an appetite for more than 10 years – that has returned,' she said.

'My ability to dream has come back, I have no more heart problems, there's no pain in my fingers and hands or sensation of skin crawling, I even look better. People say to me "if I had a before and after photo, no one would believe I was the same person", don't look so sick any more.'

But while their bodies continue to heal, the fight is not over, as Australian doctors continue to dismiss the possibility of Lyme disease being caught in Australia as well as patient's test results from overseas.

Sharon Whiteman from the Lyme Disease Association of Australia is calling for the government and medical boards to 'recognise that patients are becoming sick from tick bites'.

'Most people are only getting confirmation that they have the disease from overseas from specialist Lyme testing labs. Those tests are being dismissed as inadequate in Australia because they are not NATA (National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia) accredited,' she said.

'There are only two labs in Australia that are accredited to test for Lyme and those processes have discrepancies.

'The Chief Medical Officer found blood tests are relied upon but are unreliable. They get negative tests back and then blame patients and give them over to psychiatrist, but the research isn't up to scratch yet. An absence of evidence is not proof of absence.'
