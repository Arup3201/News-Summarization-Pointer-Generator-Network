A carjacking suspect was tracked down and detained by cops after a news chopper followed him and led officers to his hiding place.

Michael Patton stole a Yellow Cab and 'stabbed' a driver in Oklahoma City before leading officers on a high-speed chase down the I-35.

As the 30-year-old, who was wearing a blonde wig at the time, drove down the interstate, KFOR's John Welsh trailed him with his on board camera.

The pilot starts by saying: 'We are just going to start following him to see what he does.; 

After turning off, Patton, who has 11 children, then ditches the vehicle and starts running into a field of long grass on the side of the road. 

As the suspect tries to escape, Welsh starts to give the officers directions, saying: 'If those police officers could just keep coming through the trees and up the north east side, you should be right on top of him.' 

Welsh then tells officers his exact location and describes how it looks like he is 'throwing his drugs away'.

Detained: Carjacking suspect Michael Patton, 30, has been booked into jail after an Oklahoma news chopper led cops to his hiding place 

Officers finally get to Patton and cuff him, despite his desperate attempts to try and get away.

They then wave to the pilot to thank him for  his help during the chase,

After he was caught, Patton said he would 'confess to his sins' and 'do the time'.  

According to KFOR, he said: 'I didn’t have no money so this is what I had to do. I messed up, but remember I take care of my kids no matter what.'

While he was being transported to jail, he confessed to three other crimes, including stealing a necklace.  

Police say Patton stole and crashed the Yellow Cab, while officers used GPS to track the van’s location.

Cab driver Shaid Mian accused Patton of 'stabbing him' and said that he threatened to kill him.   

A statement on Facebook for the Oklahoma Police Department thanked the news crew for helping to track down the suspect.

It read: 'This afternoon, Oklahoma City Police were called to a carjacking of a Yellow Cab driver near NW 9/Meridian. When officers located the cab, a brief pursuit ensued. Due to high speeds of the suspect, the chase was terminated.

'With the assistance of GPS and also Bob Moore Chopper 4, our officers were ultimately able to take the suspect (who was wearing a blonde wig at the time of arrest) into custody in NE OKC. 30 year old Michael Patton was just booked into the Oklahoma County Jail.'

Escape: Patton, wearing a blonde wig, then ditches the car and starts running into a nearby field 

Hiding: The 30-year-old then crouches down in the long grass after 'throwing away his drugs' 

Caught: After being led to his hiding place, three officers then cuff Patton, while one waves to the news chopper, thanking them for their help in the chase
