Newcastle travel to Crystal Palace on Wednesday, but mention of the Capital One Cup third-round tie was completely overlooked in Saturday’s matchday programme.

The club blame a printing error but the slip-up is symptomatic of the Newcastle’s recent approach to cup competitions.

Last season they made public their preference to remain in the Barclays Premier League rather than attempt to win a cup.

Pressure is mounting on Alan Pardew but the home fans were mostly supportive of their team last week

They have not gone past the fourth round of the FA Cup or League Cup in seven years.

This has upset fans who last saw Newcastle lift a trophy in 1969 in the shape of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup — precursor to the UEFA Cup.

Mark Jensen, editor of The Mag fanzine, told Sportsmail: ‘To hear last year that the cups weren’t a priority was demoralising.

‘That was the start of the unrest which led to the walkout at the end of the season. If you can’t look forward to the cup games then it’s a sad day.

Papiss Cisse has been struck down by illness and will miss the game against Crystal Palace

‘It would be great to hear them come out and say we’re really going for it, but at the moment there’s nothing. Fans will be unhappy if we don’t get through or play a weakened team.’

Alan Pardew’s position as manager is safe despite United sitting bottom of the table after five games.

Supporters, who had been expected to protest, instead got behind the team as they fought back for a point against Hull on Saturday.

Tim Krul will not face Crystal Palace in the Captial One Cup due to illness 

But victory against Palace is crucial, given the fallout from the FA Cup third-round defeat by Cardiff in January when Pardew fielded a weakened side.

Illness, however, has already robbed Pardew of Papiss Cisse, who scored twice against Hull, goalkeeper Tim Krul and forward Yoan Gouffran. Siem de Jong (thigh) and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) are also missing.
