Suspicious: Michele Catalano believes her family's Google searches caused a 'Joint Terrorism Task Force' to visit her house

A Long Island woman believes her family's recent Google searches caused a Wednesday morning visit by federal agents.

Michele Catalano, a writer for Forbes, published an account of what happened on Medium today, saying six plain-clothes cops showed up at her home, and proceeded to interview her husband about pressure cookers and search her house.

She believes her 'news junkie' son reading articles on the Boston Bombings, coupled with her hunt for a pressure cooker and her husband's online shopping for a backpack created the 'perfect storm of terrorism profiling.'

But so far the FBI, Nassau County and Suffolk County Police Departments have denied their part in the call.

While she wasn't at home at the time, her husband was when three black SUVs drove up to their house and the cops exited and started to approach their property, flashing badges with handguns in their holsters.

Her husband went outside to meet the men and complied with their request to look around the house and backyard.

They walked around the living room, looked at books and pictures, and petted their dogs.

When they asked to go into the son's room, her husband said he was sleeping and they left him alone.

They also interviewed him, asking about where he was from, where his wife was, and if they had any bombs. They also asked about whether they owned a pressure cooker. 

Her husband said no, but that they had a rice cooker.

'Can you make a bomb with that?' they asked.

He told them his wife used it to make quinoa.

'What the hell is quinoa?' they asked.

What the hell is quinoa? After asking whether the family had a pressure cooker, Catalano's husband said they only have a rice cooker to cook quinoa. The officers were mystified by the ancient grain

Catalano said that 'by this point they realized they were not dealing with terrorists and the men wrapped their search up.

Her husband called her immediately after, laughing about the incident, but Catalano didn't see the humor.

She said she felt a 'great sense of anxiety' when she realized that 'this is where we are at.'

'Where you have no expectation of privacy. Where trying to learn how to cook some lentils could possibly land you on a terrorism watch list,' she wrote.

The FBI confirmed the visit to The Guardian, but said their officers weren't involved.

A spokesman said it was Nassau County Police officers working in conjunction with the Suffolk County Police Department.

But a Nassau County police spokesman told MailOnline they weren't involved.

'We did not, did not, go out to this woman's home,' police spokesman James Imperiale said. 'What agency went I couldn't tell you. I don't know.'

A Suffolk County Police spokesman referred media back to the FBI.

If the search were truly carried out due to suspicious Google searches, it would have required a warrant.

In a company report on transparency, Google detailed how they deal with law enforcement officials looking for evidence online.

'The
government needs legal process—such as a subpoena, court order or 
search warrant—to force Google to disclose user information. Exceptions 
can be made in certain emergency cases, though even then the government 
can’t force Google to disclose.'

Which has led some to question the validity of Ms Catalano's story.

Today, she took to Twitter, writing that she wasn't giving interviews to the media.

'I'll say it once: I didn't make it up,' she wrote. 'Thanks to those defending my integrity.'
