New Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini is set to offer Steven Gerrard a move in January, unless the Liverpool captain agrees a new deal at Anfield.

Gerrard also has a number of options to move to the United States next summer with New York Cosmos one potential avenue for the 34-year-old midfielder.

But the Football Grapevine understands that a move to Serie A could be very appealing.

As revealed in the Football Grapevine three weeks ago, Manuel Pellegrini faces the sack from Manchester City at the end of the season.

But it is Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone who is top of the short list to replace him at the Etihad, not Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola. My Catalan contacts tell me that Pep would rather manage Manchester United down the line rather than City.

Guardiola will see out his contract at Bayern, which runs until the summer of 2016, and, unless there is a dramatic turn of events in Manchester, the Etihad hierarchy will not wait that long.

Mike Ashley will sell Newcastle so he can fully purchase Scottish side Rangers.

But the Newcastle owner's £300million asking price is being questioned by brokers, who value the club at a maximum of £100m.

Mon: Emmanuel Adebayor has a point when he says that booing your own team mid game is hardly going to inspire. But one can understand the frustration of Spurs fans and Adebayor is hardly in a position to complain about people being fickle.

Tue: Bobby Charlton suggests captaincy for club and country could weigh Wayne Rooney down. He has a point.

Wed: Rooney says even if he ends up with 200 caps and 200 goals he will never be a football legend like Bobby Charlton. At last, some reality in Wayne’s world.

Thur: FIFA 'investigation' into allegations of awarding 2018 World Cup to Russia and 2022 to Qatar is published and instantly becomes parody when US based chief investigator Michael Garcia condemns his airbrushed report. It would seem the only way to bring down Sepp Blatter and his regime is for the FBI and the Interpol to move in.

Fri: After losing at home to Faroe Islands, Greece sack manager Claudio Ranieri. Quite right too. That's how tough they are on the continent. 

Libero: 

It was a privilege to be in the company of Besso brokers at the Lloyds insurance football club annual dinner at the Park Lane Marriott Hotel in London on Thursday.

Not least because I was able to re-engage with my greatest boyhood hero. No not Denis Law, who was on the top table, but Billy Bonds.

That said, ex-ref Howard Webb stole the night with is his self-effacing after-dinner speech.

The crowd, who initially booed Webb, whooped in applause when he said his three sons are called Wayne, Cristiano and Rio.

I am hearing:

Napoli are set to make a bid for Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski. 

I am also hearing:

The real money behind Tottenham, owner Joe Lewis, is asking questions about club chairman Daniel Levy.

Wayne Rooney’s quest to surpass Bobby Charlton's England goalscoring record of 49 could be usurped.

As it stands, there is currently a 'marksman' who is alongside Gary Lineker on 48 who will continue indefinitely.

The name? Own Goal. 

Napoli are lining up a move for Arsenal's German striker Lukas Podolski

Scotland’s 1-0 win over Ireland was further proof of how they are growing in stature under the patriotic leadership of Gordon Strachan. Given the nationalist fervour that will swirl around Celtic Park on Tuesday  like a Highland mist, England could be in for a torrid time. Coral offer 2-1 for a Scotland win.

Back Heel

It was a great goal by Shaun Maloney for Scotland in their 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifier win over the Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park on Friday.

But it still doesn't compare to Archie Gemmill’s strike against Holland at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina..
