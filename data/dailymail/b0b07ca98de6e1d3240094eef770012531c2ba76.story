A new line of Sriracha-infused foods that will be rolling out in the coming months should showcase that variety, at least with regard to snacks, is truly the spice of life. 

Huy Fong Foods in Irwindale, California, recently partnered up with Seattle-based Pop! Gourmet Foods to create the hot new line. 

On April 8, Huy Fong Sriracha potato chips will be released and bags of Huy Fong Sriracha popcorn are already on shelves.

 Huy Fong Sriracha potato chips will be released in April and croutons, tortilla chips and hummus are next

Huy Fong, which is in Irwindale, California, will release a dehydrated powder which can be sprinkled on food

Both items cost $3.99.

In addition to those two products, there are also plans for croutons, tortilla chips, hummus and other new snacks that will all be made with the unique spicy sauce.

A dehydrated powder which can be sprinkled on top of food will be released on April 20 and a it will cost $4.99 for a five ounce bottle, Yahoo reported.

Pop! Gourmet Foods founder and CEO David Israel said: 'We eat it here with our lunch, on top of fries or chicken breasts or whatever.

'McCormick does a Sriracha seasoning, but it’s not Huy Fong.

'With us, you’re getting the real deal.'

Other companies have released chips and other items that were made with Sriracha seasoning, but this will be the first line of foods made with the sauce itself. 

All of the heat-packing products will feature red and green packaging and the Huy Fong rooster.

The iconic white bird already graces bottles of Rogue's Sriracha Hot Stout beer.

The beer took gold at the 2015 World Beer Championships and is produced as part of a collaboration between Rogue and Huy Fong.

Rogue says the stout is 'ready to drink with soups, sauces, pasta, pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, chow mein, or anything you'd like to wash down with a spicy kick.'

The peppers which are used in Sriracha are grown in the US and come from one farm in Ventura County, California.

The farm is the largest red pepper farm in the country and it produces over 100 million pounds of peppers per year.

That amount keeps going up to meet the needs of Huy Fong, according to the company.
