Justin Bieber has a reputation for trouble.

But this man makes it his life's work to keep the 20-year-old on the right track.

Meet Carl Lentz, the tattooed, Mohawked pastor flanked by an 11-piece rock band, who sermonizes to U2, raps the gospel, and dresses almost exclusively in denim and leather.

'I have a special role in Justin’s life, spiritually, but...I’m not a life-motivational guy,' Lentz told the New York Post.

'We’re talking about making sure his life remains a blessing, not a burden.'

Justin has proudly publicized his trips to Lentz's Hillsong Church in New York, which runs six services every Sunday.

Last Sunday, the singer - who is currently on probation for egging his neighbor's home earlier this year - dropped by with celebrity pals Kendall Jenner, 19, and Hailey Baldwin, 17, for a high-octane day of rest.

In previous visits, he has taken on-off girlfriend Selena Gomez.

His numerous Twitter posts gushing about Lentz include one revealing that a sermon caused him to break down in tears.

'Special role': He said he has vowed to support Bieber to help him 'make it' through his troubled moments

'Love to my guy @carllentzNYC for the amazing sermon at church this morning. Love you man. I broke down today. Thank (you),' he wrote in 2013, attaching a picture of that pair beaming together.

He also shares pictures of the pair playing basketball, going for coffee, and chilling out in the sun.

'Me and my homies @ryangood24 and @carllentz at lunch talking bout our saviour Jesus Christ,' was one caption on a surly selfie.

Lentz, a former Gucci store greeter who now counts Ja Rule, Bono, and Vanessa Hudgens among his congregation, discovered Justin at the advent of his career, when the singer was just 14 years old.

'I remember being involved in this preservice prayer [backstage] and just looking at him and going, "This is going to be a challenge,"' says Lentz, who was overwhelmed by the commotion surrounding the then-14-year-old.

'Challenge': Lentz says he remembers thinking it was going to be tough for Bieber even as a young teenager

'Journey': The 34-year-old said Bieber is 'on a journey' so shouldn't be judged for his discrepancies

'And that day being like, 'I'm going to pray for this boy to make it."'

In the years since, the singer has become a core feature of Lentz's life, even staying over at the New Jersey home Lentz shares with his wife and three children.

But the past six years have nonetheless been shaky for Justin.

Hisbrawl with Orlando Bloom, appearance outside a brothel, turbulent love life, apparent racial slurs and misdemeanors have been the subject of global fascination.

'He’s on a journey,' explains Lentz, who also partied and went 'off course' while studying criminal law at North Carolina State.

'If he’s not doing good, should we abandon him?'

Instead he tries to instill faith in him with the energetic and 'hipster' services.

After a little more than three years, Hillsong estimates it draws 8,000 people to Sunday services each week. Crowds lining up are a regular weekly scene at Irving Plaza near Manhattan’s Union Square.

Hillsong often has to add additional evening sessions, which could last well into the night.

At one service, he broke out Coolio lyrics. At another he called the biblical Saul the ‘LeBron James of Judaism.’ He is an avid basketball fan and player, and is a fixture at New York Knicks games.

In others, he is emotional.

'Can you look at the person to your left and say "you look great today"?' he says during service, to a room full of laughter (followed by a chorus of 'you look great today').

He admits that they amassed many members of the congregation who came in to see what everyone was queuing up for.

'People would come in and say "what's going on?". And our people are smart enough to just say "oh just come in it's great! Free drinks!" Or whatever.

'Some guy'll ask "are there girls in there?". We're like "oh yeah, tons of girls!".'
