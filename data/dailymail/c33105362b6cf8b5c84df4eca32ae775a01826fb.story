Luis Suarez has backed his Barcelona team-mate Neymar after the Brazilian was criticised for hogging the ball during Sunday's El Clasico win against Real Madrid.

The former Liverpool man scored the winning goal early in the second half, as the Catalonian side extended their lead at the top of La Liga to four points but his team-mate came under-fire after choosing to shoot instead of pass the ball when in a good positions. 

But Suarez has defended Neymar and believes he was doing what he supposed to do as an attacker and reckons the talented attacker will win the most prestigious award a footballer can in the future.

Luis Suarez has backed his Barcelona team-mate Neymar after the forward was criticised for being 'selfish'

Neymar (centre) was defended by the Uruguayan who thinks he was right to play how he did as a forward

The Uruguayan told RAC1: 'He was right to try and finish his chances and not pass. Strikers are selfish.

'He is a key player and I'm convinced that he will win the Ballon d'Or.'

Suarez was Barcelona's hero at full time after his brilliant control was matched with an equally impressive finish following Dani Alves' pinpoint pass.

The Brazilian had a number of opportunities to release the ball in a good position but chose to go for goal

But the £75million man, was less than impressed with his overall performance. 

'The goal obviously has added significance because of who we were playing and in terms of La Liga,' he said.

'At the end of the match I made some amateurish mistakes but that was because I was tired. Luckily nothing happened.'

Barcelona were drawn against Chelsea's conquerors in the quarter finals of the Champions League after dispatching of Manchester City and ending England's hopes of having a team progress into the last eight.

But Suarez knows that his side have to beat the top teams if they want to be the best in Europe. 

'We are aware that to win the Champions have to beat the best teams, starting with PSG,' he added.
