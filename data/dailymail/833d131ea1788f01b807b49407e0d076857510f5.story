Forget David Beckham, Prince William and Orlando Bloom.

In a rather surprising victory, Dragons' Den star Peter Jones has topped a list of men who women believe would make the perfect husband...even though he is not actually married.

And it seems he beat more obvious choices because women say wealth and status are the biggest turn-ons when looking for their perfect man.

Women surveyed by dating site seekingarrangement.com said they ranked being an entrepreneur as the best job for a prospective partner, because making money was seen as 'exciting'.

Footballers came second last  the poll because even though they have millions in the bank, they cannot be trusted to be faithful.

Indeed, they ranked just above civil servants in 19th place in a list of the 20 professions listed.

Peter
 Jones, 46, is worth £220 million, according to the Sunday Times Rich 
List, after making his fortune in mobile phones and leisure.

Ironically he is unmarried to his long-term partner, Tara, with whom he has three children - and separated from his first wife, Caroline, with whom he has two children.

The dating site asked 1,000 of its female members to name the qualities they look for in a perfect husband - and the celebrities that best personify those values.
