After appearing before the judges on American Idol, you’d think she could handle the pressure.

But that didn't stop Lauren Alaina’s nerves getting the better of her as she fluffed singing the National Anthem at a Thanksgiving Day football game.

She paused for three seconds in the middle of the song before completing it with a broad grin - and cheeks blazing red with with embarrassment.

American Idol? Lauren Alaina sings the national anthem before an NFL game between the Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers in Detroit on Thursday

Her blunder sparked a Twitter frenzy and drew comparisons to Christina Aguilera, who famously bungled the National Anthem during the opening to the last Superbowl.

Speaking afterwards Alaina apologised and said that she was only human.

She also said that, unlike during her appearance on the American Idol tour, at least she did not tumble down the stairs and hurt herself.

She Tweeted: ‘I'm not a robot. I have no excuses. I messed up. You know, what can ya do. At Least (I) didn’t fall down again.

‘Thank you everyone for the kind words. But the truth is I messed up. I’m gonna spend the rest of the day being thankful for all my blessings.’

Her blunder came during the opening of the Detroit Lions v Green Bay Packers game in Detroit on Thursday.

The American Idol season 10 runner up got as far as singing: ‘What so proudly we hailed, through the twi…’ before seizing up for three seconds.

As the crowd began to murmur she picked it up with ‘...lights gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars...’ and finished it off.

Lauren Alaina

On Twitter many were actually supportive of the 17-year-old and said she did the best she could.

Brian Baumgartner, who plays Kevin Malone in ‘The Office’, Tweeted: ‘Oh Lauren Alaina… Poor you. Poor poor you….’

Kellie Pickler, who also appeared on American Idol, Tweeted: ‘HEY DOLL! YOU HANDLED YOURSELF LIKE A PRO! SEND THE BULLIES MY WAY & I’LL TELL EM’ WHERE TO GO’.

Smile Scotty Tweeted: ‘Leave the poor girl alone. She's just 17’, whilst Patrick lnNC wrote: ‘You nail the song in front of a full stadium & a worldwide TV audience on a holiday. Then you can criticize Lauren Alaina for #AnthemFail.’

The game’s commentator for Fox, Joe Buck, also told viewers: ‘It’s all about how you finish’.

Aguilera’s blunder was far worse, and happened in front of a worldwide audience of more than 100million who had tuned in to watch the last Superbowl.

The pop star accidentally repeated most of the second line of the National Anthem in place of the fourth.

It later emerged that she had cribbed the lyrics from Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia which can be edited by any member of the public.

After realising her error Aguilera, 30, issued a humbling apology and said: 'I got so lost in the moment of the song that I lost my place.

'I can only hope that everyone could feel my love for this country and the true spirit of it's anthem still came through.'

The Star Spangled Banner was written by Francis Scott Key after watching Royal Navy ships bombarding Fort McHenry in Chesapeake Bay in 1812.
