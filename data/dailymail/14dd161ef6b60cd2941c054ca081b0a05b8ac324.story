She said that Bieber’s Tweet to Avalanna ‘was something beyond his music’ and was ‘him and his fans saying goodbye to one of their own and it clearly resonated with folks’.

She added that one of the joys of Twitter was that it allowed a one-on-one conversation with a celebrity who normally would be far removed.
