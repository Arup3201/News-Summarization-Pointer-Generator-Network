The Colorado couple suspected of murdering their socialite landlord made their first court appearance Tuesday afternoon in ski resort town of Aspen.

Nancy Styler, 62, was led into Pitkin County District Court along with her wheelchair-bound husband William Francis Style III, a former doctor.

The two are facing charges of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder after their landlord, 57-year-old Nancy Pfister, was found dead in a cupboard of her ski resort home on February 26.

Arrest: William Francis Styler III, left, and his wife Nancy Styler, right, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. A woman they were renting a house from was found dead on February 26

Arrest: Styler, a physician, was still in his bathrobe when he was arrested at a motel on Monday afternoon

Caught: The couple were arrested five days after their alleged victim's body was found

Just four days before her body was 
found, Pfister returned to Colorado from an extended trip to Australia 
because of trouble with tenants.

'I'd
 like to stay in Australia but the people that were supposedly taking 
care of my house are not doing what they said they would do and they're 
not paying rent and they haven't paid utilities,' Pfister, described as a
 philanthropist, wrote on Facebook ahead of her return.

It is not been confirmed whether if she was referring to the Stylers, who are known to have rented her house from late November or early December.

Pfister is the daughter of Art and Betty Pfister who founded the Buttermilk ski resort in Aspen. Both preceded
 their daughter in death.

The Aspen-native was known to throw fundraiser parties at her home in Colorado, according to news.com.au.

The couple are currently still bars after a judge denied them bail in court Tuesday.

They Stylers were being represented by a public defender, who said William Styler has 'mental-health issues that need to be taken  care of.'

The couple remained blank-faced through the hearing attended by relatives and friends of the victim. The judge also ordered the Stylers not to have contact with three of Pfister's relatives: sisters Christina and Suzanne and daughter Julianna

Loss: Nancy Pfister, 57, was found dead four days after she returned from a trip to Australia

Missed: Pfister, pictured with her daughter, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent or bills

Heartbroken: Pfister's daughter Juliana said she did not know how anyone could hurt her caring mother

At a news conference following the 
couple's arrest on Monday, Sheriff Joe DiSalvo declined to identify how 
Pfister was killed and would not say what evidence had led them to 
arrest the couple.

He added that the investigation is ongoing and that authorities have not yet ruled out the possibility of more arrests, the Aspen Times reported.

Nancy Pfister's death is the first known homicide in Pitkin County since October 2001. Her body was found after a 911 call to local authorities, but it is not clear who placed the call.

'This case has been hard from the 
beginning on all of us, because of the nature of it,' the sheriff said. 'First-degree murders don’t happen here too often. That’s good. When 
they do, we take it very seriously, and we storm it. We throw everything
 we've got at it.'

Her daughter Juliana Pfister told ABC News that her mother had been a beloved member of the community.

'I have no idea how someone could do something like that and especially to her and I think that, you know, my mom could never hurt anything or hurt anyone and that is one thing that everyone that knew her knew,' Pfister said. 'She cared about a lot of people and helped the wrong people this time.'

Sheriff DiSalvo: 'I loved Nancy - she was a good person.'

'Friendly': Styler is seen left (with a friend) at a party Pfister threw in Nover before she went abroad

The Stylers, who are believed to have one adult son, were first questioned by investigators the day after Pfister's body was found and on Monday they were taken to the Pitkin County Jail.

They were held without bond overnight and both face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.

Public records show that Mr Styler is a physician who graduated from the Oklahoma State University College Of Osteopathic Medicine in 1979, but his credentials expired in 2005.
