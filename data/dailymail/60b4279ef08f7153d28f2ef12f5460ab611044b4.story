From high-tempo running tracks to relaxing chillout tunes, many of us have playlists in our portable music devices for different occasions.

But according to the latest study, many couples have rather specific playlists - namely baby-making playlists with a variety of inspiring songs to 'get them in the mood'.

The study, which asked parents to share the music they choose to accompany their more intimate moments, found that over half of broody couples listen to music whilst trying to conceive.

Let's get it on: A study has found that over half of broody couples listen to music whilst trying to conceive

Of these, three quarters admitted that they did so in order to help them ‘get in the mood’.

And it was Adele's awarding-winning track Someone Like You that was the number one preference for broody couples.

In second place was Kings Of Leon's rock track Sex On Fire, followed by the slightly cliche R. Kelly Bump N' Grind single.

Unsurprisingly, Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On made the top five and his Sexual Healing single was voted in eighth place.

Kieron Donoghue, founder of ShareMyPlaylists.com, who carried out the study and put together the ultimate baby making playlist, said: 'Music
plays a huge part in every aspect of life, and it’s no surprise to see 
that Britons make full use of it in the bedroom department.

What gets them in the mood: Adele's ballad Someone Like You and Kings Of Leon's Sex Is On Fire are among the top three tracks that couple's conceiving babies like to listen to

'We wanted to
find out more about which songs get Brits in the mood the most, 
specifically when it comes to baby making, which can be a stressful time
in the bedroom department for many.

'Based on the results, we’ve been 
able to put together what we see as the "ultimate baby making playlist" to help broody couples around the country.

'The
songs are tried and tested by parents, so whilst we can’t guarantee the
success they’ll encourage, we can guarantee that they’ll help get you 
in the mood!'
