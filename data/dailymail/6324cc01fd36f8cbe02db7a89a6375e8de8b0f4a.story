Young Tory activists are being encouraged to campaign ahead of the election with the promise of an Ibiza clubbing holiday with David and Samantha Cameron.

Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps is using the prospect of a week on the party island to persuade hundreds of volunteers to knock on more doors and deliver more leaflets.

He has even told the Prime Minister about his plan designed to bolster numbers for the Team 2015 campaign drive, admitting that he is only 'slightly joking'.

Tory volunteers are being promised the prospect of a holiday with David and Samantha Cameron in Ibiza, where the couple holidayed in 2011

The Conservatives have invested heavily in the Team 2015, luring in young activists with the promise of curry, booze and like minded singletons.

It has been a huge success, signing up hundreds of activists who pile into buses at weekends to descend on key target seats.

After a busy day of campaigning, the party lays on dinner before they enjoy a night in the pubs and clubs of whichever town they find themselves in.

Seeking to tap into the enthusiasm for clubbing, Mr Shapps has been dangling the prospect of a week with the Prime Minister and his wife for the hardest campaigner.

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said he was only 'slightly joking' about offering the best campaigner a break with the PM

The Road Trips are his invention, and is part of a plan to make campaigning 'fun' and draw in a younger generation of Conservative supporters with the scheme modelled the group on the Olympics' games makers.

He told The Times: 'We have team captains, T-shirts, road trips, conference calls with ministers.

'I always tell the prime minister the top prize for our No 1 worker is going on holiday with Sam and Dave to Ibiza next summer. He thinks I'm joking.'

The Camerons spent a week in Ibiza in 2011 in a villa, where guests can enjoy in-house massages, a butler service, yoga and pilates.

Last month Mr Cameron organised an Ibiza-style rave at his Chequers rural retreat as a belated 40th birthday for his wife.

The Road Trip campaign drive has attracted hundreds of young people, and sparked romances. Mr Shapps predicts there will soon be a wedding

The star attraction was DJ Sarah HB, with (short for 'Hard Bitch'), who played to 200 guests including comedian Harry Enfield, actress Helena Bonham Carter and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

Mr Cameron was said to have been 'throwing shapes' in an open-necked collar and jeans, and dancing went on until 3am. 

Mr Shapps insisted that he has told the PM of his plan. 'I am actually slightly joking but I do tell the prime minister with a straight face.' 

The road trips have also become an unofficial dating agency for like-minded young Tories, Mr Shapps revealed. 'If you send people out with a clipboard on a rainy Tuesday night they will come back depressed and never come again, but if you make it fun, go out together, have a good time and go out for a drink afterwards people will come back. 

'We are looking forward to the first wedding out of 2015.'
