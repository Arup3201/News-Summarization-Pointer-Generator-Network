West Ham will hold further talks with free agent Hugo Almeida amid interest from Eintracht Frankfurt.

Sam Allardyce wants two forwards following injury to Andy Carroll. 

He is also keen to take Arsenal's Joel Campbell on loan but faces competition from AC Milan while Arsene Wenger has so far stated he wants the 22-year-old to stay at Arsenal. 

AC Milan have also revived interest in QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt.
