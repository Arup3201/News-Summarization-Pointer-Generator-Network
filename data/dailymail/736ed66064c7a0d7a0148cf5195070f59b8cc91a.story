Chelsea Manning is doing well at the start of her prison sentence after announcing her desire to live as a woman, according to her lawyer.

Manning, who was previously known as Bradley, is currently going through a three- to four-week 'indoctrination' at Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas at the start of a 35-year jail term for leaking Government secrets.

Her lawyer David Coombs wrote on his blog that he spoke with Manning on Wednesday and plans to visit medical staff and bosses at the prison in a bid to allow her to undergo hormone therapy and other treatment for her gender dysphoria.

Officials have previously said they will not allow her to go through the sex change procedure in prison, but the lawyer has vowed to challenge the ruling.

'Doing well': Chelsea Manning, pictured here in a U.S Army supplied photo, is said to be doing well as she undergoes 'indoctrination' at the beginning of her 35 year jail term for leaking Government secrets

Mr Coombs wrote: 'Yesterday was my first opportunity to speak with Chelsea since her sentencing.Â  I am happy to report that she is doing very well at the [prison], and has already made several friends who accept her for who she is.

'She requested that I relay how grateful that she is for everyone's understanding and continued support.'

Announcement: Manning, seen here during her trial, announced last week that she wishes to undergo hormone therapy and live as a woman

Mr Coombs went on the Today show last 
week, a day after Manning was sentenced, to announce that Manning wants 
to live as a woman named Chelsea and begin hormone treatment as soon as 
possible.

He wrote: 'These 
requests address a serious medical need of Chelsea and are consistent 
with the general medical community's practice of adequate medical care 
for those with gender dysphoria.'

It is Army policy not to provide such treatment; soldiers diagnosed with gender dysphoria - a condition where sufferers feel that there is a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity - are administratively discharged.

But Manning cannot be discharged until she completes her prison sentence and exhausts all appeals of her court-martial findings.

When asked on Thursday whether Manning has yet requested treatment, Coombs said it was too soon to provide additional information.

He had said earlier in the week that if the Army refuses to pay for it, Manning will pay, but it is not clear whether the prison will allow that.

Army Medical Command spokeswoman Maria Tolleson said soldiers are allowed on a case-by-case basis to pay for procedures not covered by the military's medical insurance programme, such as elective cosmetic surgery.

Support: Manning's lawyer David Coombs announced the soldier's new identity on the Today show last week

Manning was diagnosed with gender 
dysphoria by two Army behavioral health specialists before her trial, 
but Tolleson said in an email that patient medical records are reviewed 
and prisoners are re-evaluated when they move to a new facility.

She
said Army providers use nationally recognized standards found in the 
current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.

Coombs
wrote on his blog that he told Manning during their conversation of the
public's response to the Today show announcement, and of the decision 
by most major news outlets to refer to her as a woman using her new name.

He said: 'Chelsea was very happy to hear of these developments.'
