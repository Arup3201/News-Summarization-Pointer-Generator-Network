A mother has revealed her joy at learning that her son, who was abducted by his paternal grandparents in 1994 when he was just five years old, is alive, married and expecting his first child.

For nearly 20 years, Lisa Harter knew nothing of the whereabouts of her son, Richard Landers Jr., after his grandparents vanished from their trailer in Wolcottville, Indiana with the young boy.

They had been raising the child at their home and are believed to have taken off with him as they were unhappy with the court granting Mrs Harter custody for a trial period.

But now detectives have tracked him down through his social security number and discovered the 24-year-old living 680 miles away in Long Prairie, Minnesota under the name Michael Jeff Landers.

Relief: Lisa Harter (left) 'jumped up and down for joy' when she learned her son Richard Landers (right), who was abducted by his grandparents when he was five, was alive and well - now aged 24

Mrs Harter, who lives in LaGrange, Indiana, told the Star Tribune she was overwhelmed with relief and joy
when she learned that her long-lost son was safe.

'It's such a relief that he's been found and that he's alive and that he's healthy,' she said. 'I found this out two days ago, and I'm so excited. I'm pretty happy.

'I
know he's married and he has a child on the way. I've seen pictures of 
him. He looks like a man. I last saw him when he was a boy. He looks so 
different.'

While they have not yet had a reunion, she said she is desperate to see her son.

'I'm
a little nervous because I haven't seen him for a long time,' she said.
'I want to tell him I want to see [him]. I want to talk to [him.] But I
might cry.'

She was 'jumping up and down for joy' when investigators revealed her son had been found, her husband Richard Harter said. He added that his wife is 'the happiest woman on earth'.

Missed: The boy was taken amid a custody battle between his mother and paternal grandparents

When Landers was tracked down this 
past fall, he admitted to police that he knew his real name, though he 
had been living under a different alias almost his entire life.

Minnesota officials say the 
grandparents, now using the names Raymond Michael Iddings and Susan Kay 
Iddings, verified Landers' identity.

Authorities said they do not know 
what they had told him about their swift departure from 
Indiana 18 years ago. But
when he was five and caught in the middle of the custody battle, he 
said he wanted to live with his grandparents, the Star Tribune reported.

'He
appears to be well adjusted, there was no indication or signs of any 
kind of abuse over the years,' Indiana State Police Sgt Ron Galaviz told
MailOnline. 'It just appears on its face that his grandparents raised 
him as their own child over these last 18 years.'

Before the abduction, Landers' paternal
grandparents, then known as Richard and Ruth Landers, were raising the 
young boy as his mother had had a troubled relationship with 
their son.

Child
welfare services stepped in after she ended up in a homeless shelter 
and because she has some developmental disabilities, Harter's attorney 
Richard Muntz told the Star Tribune.

But in 1994, when she was living in her own home, working and remarried, she began fighting to regain custody of her son. However, the grandparents were 
upset about the court proceedings.

Just days before Landers' mother was due to take him for a one week visitation in July 1994, he disappeared without
a trace.

'The grandparents went to the bank, drew 
$5,000 out of a home equity line and stopped for breakfast at a local 
restaurant,' Muntz said. That was the last time they were seen in the town.

Detectives followed his grandparents' bank account, tracked down family members as far away as 
Washington State and monitored a cabin in Michigan that the grandparents
owned, but there was no sign of little Richard.

The
break in the case came in September 2012, when the boy's step-father, 
Richard Harter, came to Indiana State Police with the missing child's 
social security card - asking if they could run the numbers again, he told the Star Tribune.

Long way from home: Landers was found 680 miles from the trailer where he disappeared

The search turned up a man with the same number and date of birth living in Minnesota. Police then found that a driver's license photo for the man appeared to resemble Landers.

When local Minnesota police tracked down the man, he admitted that he was Landers. His grandparents were living in another small Minnesota town eight miles north of Long Prairie.

After the abduction in the 1990s, arrest warrants were issued for both grandparents, charging 
them with interference with custody, a Class B Misdemeanor.

In 1999, the 
charges were boosted to a Class C Felony, but in 2008, with neither the 
child nor the grandparents being located, the charges were dropped.

And now, despite tearing Landers away
from his biological parents 18 years ago, the grandparents have not 
been charged, Galaviz said.

However, authorities in 
Minnesota are still investigating the case, and it will eventually be 
passed on to the County Attorney's office.

Police said they did not 
know whether Landers was planning a reunion with his biological mother, and 
he has been unable to travel to their home so far.

'To get this dropped in his lap at 
age 24, after all these years, God knows that it's something he'll have 
work out for himself,' Galaviz said.
