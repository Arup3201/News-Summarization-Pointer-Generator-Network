The owners of a Washington state drinks bottle company have turned an irate customer's rant into rave reviews.

When Liberty Bottleworks co-founder Ryan Clark saw an angry review from a customer who complained she was unable to speak to anyone over a weekend, he responded straight away.

But instead of using the customer is always right line, Mr Clark defended his staff's right to uninterrupted family time over the weekends and at holidays.

'People over profit': Liberty Bottle founders Ryan Clark and Tim Andis have been praised for standing up for their employees

'We pride ourselves on doing things the American way,' Mr Clark wrote to the unnamed customer.

'Not the instant gratification 24-hour shopping on Thanksgiving kind of American way, but family and country kind of American way.'

The response clearly hit a chord with customers and fans of Liberty Bottle, an all-American produced product that hires Vets to help with its work.

Liberty's Facebook page received more than 10,000 new likes and orders nearly doubled from the previous month.

'You can't give up your people for profit. You can't give up your ethics, beliefs or your core principals simply for another bottle sale,' Mr Clark told KIMA TV.

A screenshot of the polite response to the negative review, which had been written in capital letters, has since been removed but not before it went viral.

Company policy: Ryan Clark responded to the complaint, saying he was sorry the customer was upset but adding that staff were entitled to family time

A few days after posting the response, the company was inundated with so many orders that it had to post a message on its Facebook page asking customers to be patient and understanding.

The angry customer had complained about a lost payment and, in her review, advised others that 'If they have a deadline - like Christmas - forget about it', Gawker reported.

She complained that instead of being able to prepare for the holidays she had wasted her weekend trying to deal with her complaint.

In response, Mr Clark politely 
suggested that the customer should try embracing the holiday spirit 
herself, adding that his staff had been 'home with their families, doing
their cards, baking cookies etc'.

And,
although he gave her his personal cell number in case she wanted to 
discuss the matter further, he also reiterated his company policy of 
'Family first, product second'.

Co-founder Tim Andis defended his company's customer service hours. 'You're competing against people like 
Google who have live support 24 hours a day. Being a small manufacturer we're not going to have live support 24 
hours a day.'

The company have tried to learn from the experience and have taken note of suggestions customers made for improvements since the story went viral.

Mr Clark was pleasantly shocked by the interest in his company after the response, telling Yakima Herald: 'You can’t trade that for a bottle. You can’t trade that for 100 bottles. You can’t trade that at all.'

He added: 'We have this silly belief that you can do well by doing good. To see the number of people reaffirm [the idea] is kind of a neat thing.'

However, Mr Clark was uncomfortable with some of the negative and nasty comments made about his lost customer, saying his message had been 'Be nice ... not to say mean things'.
