The man who played actor Daniel Craig's James Bond stunt in the opening ceremony of London 2012 died when a wing suit jump went wrong in the Swiss Alps, an inquest heard.

Wing suit flying enthusiast Mark Sutton was killed at Trient, near Lake Geneva, on August 14 2013.

The 42-year-old appeared on television screens across the world when he parachuted into the Olympic opening ceremony as James Bond with a fellow stuntman playing the Queen.

An inquest into his tragic death at Loughborough Coroner's Court on Thursday heard that the former Army officer crashed into a mountain ridge at high speed.

Trevor Kirkman, senior coroner for Rutland and North Leicestershire, said: 'The circumstances of Mr Sutton's death were fully investigated in Switzerland.

'But following repatriation of his body, a post-mortem examination was undertaken at Leicester Royal Infirmary.'

Home Office pathologist professor Guy Rutty, in a report read at Thursday's hearing, gave the medical cause of death as a 'head injury sustained while wing suit flying'.

Wing suit flyers wear suits designed to allow them to glide at high speed before a parachute is opened for landing.

The coroner said: 'Mr Sutton had jumped from a helicopter wearing a wing suit, camera and parachute. He crashed into a mountain range at a speed of about 150mph.

'He took the full force of the impact on his head, resulting - without doubt in Professor Rutty's opinion - in instantaneous death.'

Mr Kirkham referred to a report from the Swiss accident investigation. 'It tells me Mr Sutton was well used to making jumps of this nature,' he said.

'He was making his first jump of the day. Video footage showed him approaching the crest of a hill.

'He crossed the crest line of that hill, but there was a second crest and, due to a lack of height, had hit the rocks just before the second crest.'

Mr Sutton was killed when taking part int the three-day HeliBASE event. The event, which featured 23 of the world's best wing suit flyers was filmed for extreme sports broadcaster Epic TV (video below).

Recording his verdict, Mr Kirkham said: 'It is quite clear this was a tragic accident.

'I would like to express my sincere condolences to all of Mark Sutton's family.

'Many people have had great pleasure in watching what he used to do most expertly.'

Mr Sutton was a former pupil of Oakham School in Rutland. In the school's magazine, he had described playing the part of James Bond, as a stuntman, as his 'boyhood fantasy'.

He had learned to skydive while serving with the Gurkhas in Hong Kong and had taken up base-jumping in 2005.

In tributes paid earlier Danny Boyle, who directed the Olympic opening ceremony, described him as a 'gentle and thoughtful' man.

'The show was built from so many contributions from so many people, none finer and braver than Mark Sutton's.'

Lord Coe, who chaired the committee that organised London 2012, described him as a 'consummate professional and team player'.

The HeliBASE team published the Epic TV footage of the day Mark Sutton died in his memory.

In the clip, his friend and flying partner Tony Uragello, who flew down behind Mr Sutton in the final moments of his life, said that he would retire from the sport, despite being the founder of Tony Suits a wingsuit company.

Mr Sutton's girlfriend paid tribute to her boyfriend last year describing him as a man who brought 'joy and laughter to millions'.

Victoria Homewood said his death had left a void that could not be filled, but said his 'passion, spirit, bravery and love will live on to inspire us all.'

Modern wing suits, also known as birdman suits, were first developed during the 1990s and allow jumpers to cover huge amounts of ground at speeds well over 200mph.

The practice uses a special jumpsuit with webbing between the limbs to add surface area to the body and give it lift to enable to wearer to glide towards the ground.

The wingsuiter uses their body to control forward speed, direction and lift.Â  As they approach the ground that is when a wingsuiter will deploy a parachute.

According to wingsuitcity.com, it is generally accepted that wing suiting adds a degree of complexity to skydiving, with risks such as uncontrollable spinning, hitting an aircraft's tail on exit and extra material to manage.
