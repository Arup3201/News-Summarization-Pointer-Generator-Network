Boost: Large businesses yesterday scooped a £3billion tax cut which will slash corporation tax to the lowest rate of any major western economy. Chancellor George Osborne, left, is pictured yesterday

Large businesses yesterday scooped a £3billion tax cut which will slash corporation tax to the lowest rate of any major western economy.

In a surprise move, George Osborne said the rate will drop to 21 per cent in 2014, sending a clear message that Britain is ‘open for business’.

It is the fourth time the Chancellor has used either a budget or an autumn statement to cut the key corporate tax rate.

In May 2010 – the month Mr Osborne became Chancellor – corporation tax was 28 per cent for large businesses which make profits of more than £300,000 a year.

The tax cut is significant. Official figures, published yesterday by the Treasury, show it will save firms £415million in 2014/15, rising to £785million the following year.

In the following two years, it will be worth £875million in each year, making a total of £2.96billion.

The Chancellor, the son of two entrepreneurs, said he wanted Britain to have ‘the most competitive business tax regime of any major economy’.

He said the tax cut was ‘an advert for our country that says, “Come here, invest here, create jobs here. Britain is open for business”.’

Richard Baron, head of taxation at the Institute of Directors, the business lobby group, said the move should help the private sector to create jobs at a time when unemployment is 2.5million.

He added: ‘Reducing the tax burden for all businesses is the most straightforward way to help them expand and take on more staff.’

The Institute of Directors wants corporation tax to drop to 15 per cent.

But experts warned yesterday of a sting in the tail of the corporation tax cut through a crippling back-door tax hike in business rates.

Worrying: Big chains such as Clintons, Game, Peacocks, JJB and Comet, pictured, have either disappeared or have lost hundreds of outlets

     Each year, the increase in business 
rates, which comes into force in April, is linked to the previous 
September’s RPI figure, which was 2.6 per cent.

The massive increase will hit businesses, particularly small shops – many of which are struggling to survive.

Stephen Robertson, director general of the British Retail Consortium, said he will continue to campaign for a freeze in business rates following two years of punishing increases.

‘The Chancellor’s failure to offer immediate support for struggling high streets by announcing a business rates freeze is disappointing.

‘A third successive, substantial rates hike will deliver a further blow to investment and job creation.’ 

Mr Robertson said recent increases had already hit the high streets, resulting in empty shops and redundancies. One in every nine shops is lying empty. Some 32 shops closed every day over the summer, raising the spectre of yet more high streets turning into ‘ghost towns’.

Big chains such as Clintons, Game, Peacocks, JJB and Comet have either disappeared or have lost hundreds of outlets.

As a result, town centres are seeing more pawnbrokers, bookmakers, charity shops, coffee shops, payday loan firms and convenience stores run by the ‘big four’ supermarkets.

Firms struggling to survive the tough economic climate have been handed a huge increase in the value of their tax breaks for investment in new machinery.

At present, they enjoy tax relief on £25,000 of investment each year. From 1 January, it will jump tenfold to £250,000 for the next two years in a move which will cost the Treasury nearly £1.6billion.

But last night the Chartered Institute of Taxation called for ‘stability’, criticising the fact that the annual allowance has fluctuated over the past few years, knocking business confidence.

     Andrew Gotch, from the institute, said: ‘Businesses like certainty above everything and the chopping and changing of the annual investment allowance has been a problem.’

A Forum of Private Business spokesman said: ‘The increase is welcome but it is also a tacit admission that the decision to cut the same allowance to £25,000 this year was a wrong one.

‘Given that UK businesses are currently 
sitting on £700billion of cash reserves, it could be argued that the 
earlier actions of the Chancellor created a disincentive to invest 
through 2012, at a time when business needs confidence to create 
growth.’

In a further boost for business, 
500,000 small businesses will benefit from the Chancellor’s decision to 
extend a crucial exemption which allows them to escape paying business 
rates.

Mr Osborne said the 
small business rate relief holiday, which had been due to end in April, 
will be extended by a year. It allows small firms with a rateable value 
of up to £6,000 to pay no business rates, and cuts bills for larger 
firms with a rateable value of up to £12,000.

Mr
Osborne said 330,000 will pay no business rates at all, equal to an 
average saving of £1,650, with a further 150,000 paying lower rates as a
result of the extension.
