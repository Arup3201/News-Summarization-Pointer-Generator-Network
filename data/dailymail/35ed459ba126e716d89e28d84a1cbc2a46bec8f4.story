Prime Minister David Cameron today congratulated Mini makers BMW as the company marked the 100th anniversary of car production at Oxford.

It was on March 28, 1913 that the Cowley plant produced its first car - the Bullnose Morris Oxford.

Today, Mr Cameron said: 'The Government is working closely with the automotive industry so that it continues to compete and thrive in the global race, and the success of Mini around the world stands as a fine example of British manufacturing at its best.'

He added: 'The substantial contribution which the Oxford plant has made to the local area and the British economy over the last 100 years is something we should be proud of.'

The Cowley plant has produced more than 11 million vehicles in its 100 years.

Celebrating the milestone today, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin and Harald Krueger, member of the board of management of BMW AG, opened a centenary exhibition at the plant.

Mr McLoughlin viewed the new bodyshop and some of the 1,000 new robots being installed in this facility.

It represents the lion’s share of BMW Group’s £750 million UK investment programme, preparing the company’s manufacturing facilities for the next generation Mini.

Mr McLoughlin said: 'A thriving automotive sector is central to this Government’s commitment to driving economic growth.

'By creating jobs and exporting British-made products to global markets, Mini is sending a clear message that this country is open for business.'

The plant was originally owned by William Morris, one of the great names of British motoring, who later became Lord Nuffield.

Cowley - a small district of Oxford - became a world-famous factory, turning out such iconic models as the MG, the Wolseley, the Riley, the Austin and, in 1959, the Mini.

Mr Cameron said: 'The Government is working closely with the automotive industry so that it continues to compete and thrive in the global race'

William Morris owned the factory directly and then through Morris Motors until 1952 when Morris merged with rival Austin to form the British Motor Corporation (BMC).

Before that, Cowley did its bit for the war effort in the Second World War by building Tiger Moth aircraft, ambulances and military trucks as well as carrying out repairs on damaged Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft.

BMC became British Motor Holdings in 1967 after merging with Jaguar and in 1968 the company merged with the Leyland Truck Company to form British Leyland Motor Corporation.

Troubled times followed its nationalisation in the mid-70s, with the UK motor industry suffering damaging strikes and large corporate losses.

The company eventually became the Rover Group in 1986 and was sold to British Aerospace in 1988, with German company BMW taking over in 1994.

In 2001, BMW started producing a new, more powerful version of the Mini and the brand has enjoyed a new lease of life.

At one time in the 1960s, Cowley employed as many as 28,000 employees.

Perhaps keen to disassociate itself with the strike-ridden days of old, BMW decided to drop the Cowley name when it took over, referring to the factory as Plant Oxford.

Today, Oxford employs 3,700 staff who manufacture up to 900 Minis a day.
