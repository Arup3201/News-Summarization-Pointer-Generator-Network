England have no plans to reinforce the squad to tour Sri Lanka despite James Anderson joining Stuart Broad in missing out.

The 32-year-old Anderson was ruled out on Tuesday as he continues to recover from a knee injury.

Anderson suffered some discomfort in his knee this summer and, with the World Cup taking place in February, will undergo a phased return in the next two months.

The ECB said in a statement: 'James Anderson has been ruled out of the upcoming one day tour to Sri Lanka to continue his rehabilitation on a pre-existing left knee injury.

'Anderson experienced some knee discomfort during the summer and in preparation for the ICC Cricket World Cup will undergo a graded return to bowling programme over the next two months.

'Anderson's return to bowling programme will include a period in South Africa in December with the England Performance Programme in preparation for the tri-series against Australia and India and the ICC Cricket World Cup.

'At present Anderson will not be replaced in the squad for the Sri Lanka tour.'

England will take on Sri Lanka in seven ODIs, beginning in Colombo on November 26.

Anderson's absence comes on top of the unavailability of Stuart Broad, also ruled out by a knee problem.

It means England are without their familiar pace spearheads for the series, with responsibility shifting to Steven Finn, Harry Gurney, Chris Jordan, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes.

The Lancashire bowler has taken 257 wickets in 184 one-day international appearances for England
