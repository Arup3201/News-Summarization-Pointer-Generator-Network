A vain Malaysian man who ordered a penis enlarger online was stunned when the device was delivered - a magnifying glass!

To add insult to injury the magnifying glass came with an instruction that would at least prevent the man from causing injury to himself.

It read: Do Not Use in Sunlight.

A Malaysian man identified only as Ong has complained after he spent the equivalent of £100 on a penis enlarger online, but was sent a magnifying glass worth just £5 instead

The victim of an elaborate scam, which cost him the equivalent of £100 for a £5 magnifyer has been named only as Ong, the chairman of Malaysia's customer complaints bureau, Mr Seri Michael Chong, told The Star newspaper.

'As you can imagine, he is feeling rather disgruntled,' said Mr Chong.

The deflated and embarrassed customer has not come forward to reveal who he ordered the penis enlarger from.

'The unfortunate gentleman is just one of many who have fallen victims to these kind of misleading scams,' Mr Chong said.

'Men and women are equally vulnerable to these scams. Three people lost a total of more than £15,000 to these scams this year alone.'

The man has refused to come forward and name the company he bought the enlarger from. Lawyers say he is unlikely to get his money back due to the dubious nature the business

Online tricksters, he said, lure their victims by selling their products at a low price and very often the items never get to their customers.

Lawyer Alex Kok said that unsatisfied customers who wished to sue online criminals would find it difficult to do so due to the dubious nature of the business.

'It is especially hard if there is no proof of purchase, such as receipts.

'We wouldn’t know who to sue or where and how to sue them,' he told the paper.
