Arsene Wenger believes Roy Hodgson will waste Jack Wilshere’s talent if he continues to play him in a deep midfield role.

The Arsenal star earned mixed reviews for playing at the base of a diamond formation on Monday’s 2-0 victory over Switzerland. 

A paucity of defensive midfield options for both England and Arsenal has led many commentators, including Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher, to state that Wilshere may be best served tailoring his game for a deeper role. Arsenal manager Wenger thinks differently, however.

Jack Wilshere's talent will be wasted if Roy Hodgson continues to play the Arsenal midfielder in a deep role for England, claims Arsene Wenger

‘I personally prefer Jack Wilshere in a more advanced position than in a deep-lying role as a midfielder,’ he said.

‘If it works [playing deeper], it works and I am very happy for him but I think he is a guy capable of creating danger in the final third. He is provocative in his dribbling and I would like to use this quality.’

Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off against Manchester City marks Bacary Sagna’s return to the Emirates after the France right back left London to join the Premier League champions.

For Wenger, his compatriot’s decision to join a Premier League rival when his contract ran out has left a bitter taste.

‘I am sorry he left us because I absolutely tried to keep him. He was a very good player and could cover us in central defence. We lost him. He could have gone even if Man City did not exist, he could have gone somewhere, Italy, anywhere.’
