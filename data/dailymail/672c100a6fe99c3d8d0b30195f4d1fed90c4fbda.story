A collection of 150 love letters discovered in an attic after being hidden for almost a century document the heartwarming story of a World War One romance between two sweethearts.

Young soldier Henry Coulter, who signed up with the 17th (Leeds) Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment in the spring of 1915, wrote dozens of love letters to his girlfriend Lucy Townend, signing them 'Yours for Eternity, Henry'.

Tragically, their blossoming love story ended early, as on October 10, 1916, Henry - who by then had been promoted to Corporal - was wounded in a shell blast in France and died from his injuries a few days later.

Lucy's final letter to him was returned unopened - becoming one of 150 she kept hidden away for decades until her death in 1982.

They were re-discovered hidden in a tin box in the attic of her home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, by a new owner.

In one letter, Henry tells Lucy: 'Whenever I think of home or you, it always makes tears come into my eyes and I am not the only one here by a long way.

'You would be surprised to see some of our most toughest of fellows break down when we talk about home. But there, this is to be a cheerful letter not a funeral.'

In another letter, young Henry enclosed a brooch, telling Lucy: 'I hope you will like it and wear it for me my darling.

'It will be a constant reminder that someone whom you love very dearly is trying his level best to do his best for King and Country.'

After the letters were found they were passed to local historian and former museum curator John Rumsby.

He said: 'A friend of my daughter was exploring her newly-purchased house in Birkby, Huddersfield, and in the attic she found a rusty tin box.

'Inside was a bundle of about 150 letters and postcards, in their original envelopes.

'A quick look at some of the contents revealed them to be the correspondence between a Huddersfield soldier and his sweetheart, written between 1914 and 1916.

'The soldier, Henry Coulter, lived in Marsh, Huddersfield, and his girlfriend, Lucy Townend, lived in the house where the letters were found.

'Most of the letters were written whilst Henry was in training in various camps in England. Only the last few were sent whilst he was on active service in France.

'The letters contain no great military revelations: they were written to entertain and reassure his sweetheart, not to satisfy future military historians.

'He was much more concerned with expressing his love, in often painfully intimate terms, for his 'Beauty,' Lucy, whom he refers to several times as his future wife.

'He signs most of his letters "Yours for Eternity, Henry".'

The poignant story will be told in a book due to be published later this year by the Huddersfield Local History Society to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the Great War.

Mr Rumsby, a former museum curator, said: 'Up until August 1914, Henry would not have had a clue about the possibility of becoming a soldier - he was probably thinking of a life with Lucy.

Mr Rumsby said: 'It's sad, knowing what happened, to read about the joy of two young people enjoying life'

'All of a sudden people were joining up and I think he had difficulty joining up because he was rather short. You had to be at least 5ft 3in to join the Army, so he didn't join until the spring of 1915 when he got in a Leeds Bantams battalion after they relaxed the height restrictions.'

In one letter, Henry makes a joke about his height in one of several comic monologues he penned himself.

'There are several monologues which are quite witty. There are also some quite funny little jokes. He also teases his girlfriend and she teases him back about her becoming a conductor on the trams.'

Her final letter to Henry was returned with a note on the envelope which simply, heartbreakingly, said: 'Died in hospital before letter received.'

'One hopes that she had already heard from Henry's father before she received that,' says Mr Rumsby.

It is thought that Henry had hoped to marry his sweetheart on his return from France - as he had sent her a ring gauge so she could tell him her wedding finger measurement.

Lucy got married in 1924 and had two children but it is apparent that she never forgot about her first love.

'It's sad, knowing what happened, to read about the joy of two young people enjoying life,' the historian said.

'The letters end in 1916 and they were wrapped in a newspaper reporting his death.'

He added that the story was that of the courtship of two typical working class people.

'They seem to have gone to the same church together - Gledholt Methodist - and enjoyed going to the Pictures and had their favourite stars like Gladys Cooper and Charlie Chaplin, which they talked about in the letters.'

Henry had worked as a clerk in the tramways department and Lucy worked in a shoe shop in Huddersfield town centre.
