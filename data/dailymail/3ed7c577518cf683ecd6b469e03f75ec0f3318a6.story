George Groves, who took to America his campaign for his second shot at Carl Froch, is refusing to sign-on for a second re-match should he win at Wembley.

As he prepares to box in front of a record 80,000 crowd, Groves has vetoed a contract clause for a third Battle of Britain.

Groves roused a clamour of public support when he petitioned the IBF to impose Saturday night's mandatory defence on Froch but is unwilling to make the same commitment in return.

No third meeting: George Groves will not offer Carl Froch a rematch if he wins their second fight on Saturday

Relaxed: Groves is confident he can right the wrongs of the first fight and beat Froch to become world champion

Froch smiles wryly at being ordered by the IBF — whose world super-middleweight title he holds — to oblige his young challenger. The irony is not lost on him that Groves has insisted on deleting from the multi-million-pound contract a clause providing for a third fight in the event that he wins this time.

Froch says: ‘Accidents can happen in the ring but it’s interesting that George won’t offer me another rematch if he gets lucky. And while I’m fighting him again he never gave a second chance to Kenny Anderson.’

That is a reference to the Commonwealth super-middleweight title fight in 2010 to which Anderson came as a late substitute with a few days’ training.

Anderson shocked Groves with an early knockdown before being stopped in the sixth round. His calls for a rematch with time to prepare went unheeded.

One time only: Groves opted not to have a rematch with Kenny Anderson after beating him in Manchester

Second time around: Froch beat Mikkel Kessler in their rematch at the O2 Arena last May

Groves can argue Anderson lapsed into amphetamine use soon after. But that remains the only defeat on the Scot’s 19-fight record; he has since won the British title.

Another fight between them would not have reached the magnitude that is gripping the nation this weekend. Can Froch-Groves II live up to expectations, equal or surpass the excitement of five months ago?

Both men believe so. Groves says: ‘This will be a great fight, even if it is one Carl cannot win in the end. I will knock him out in the third.’

Froch says: ‘George is getting stopped. Probably in the mid-to-late rounds but sooner if he tries to fulfil that early prediction.’
