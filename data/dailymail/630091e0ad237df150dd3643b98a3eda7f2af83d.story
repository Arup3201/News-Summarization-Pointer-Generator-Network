When Callie Martin suffered an ectopic pregnancy following three miscarriages, she thought her dreams of having a baby were over.

But six months after having emergency surgery to remove the embryo, she gave birth to a little girl – after doctors realised she had been carrying twins.

Unbeknown to the 26-year-old and her medics, she had conceived both normally and ectopically at the same time. And at odds of just 50,000 to one, her daughter Emmie survived in the womb – despite the trauma of an invasive operation.

'When doctors told me I was still pregnant I thought they must be wrong,' the customer service adviser said.

'But when they showed me the scan and I saw her heart beating, I was just overcome with joy.' 

Miss Martin and her partner Kailan Broughton, 24, were 'simply devastated' when she began to miscarry at eight weeks pregnant last year. 

They were told their baby had begun developing in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus – a potentially fatal condition which meant Miss Martin needed urgent surgery to end the pregnancy and save her life.

'We'd already had three miscarriages,' Miss Martin said. 'It felt as if I'd never be a mother.'

Yet four weeks after the operation, she felt pain in her stomach and was rushed to hospital for an ultrasound scan.

It was then that astounded doctors discovered a tiny second embryo developing normally in her uterus and realised she had what's known as a heterotopic pregnancy. '[It] is so rare that although doctors said they'd heard of it, no one had ever actually seen it before,' Miss Martin added.

The condition is usually associated with IVF, making Miss Martin's case even more unusual as she had conceived naturally.

Knowing his partner had been to hospital, Mr Broughton rushed back to their home in Greenwich, South East London, to be with her. 'He saw me crying and was sick with worry. But I was crying with joy,' she said.

After an otherwise healthy pregnancy, Emmie was delivered by caesarean section in August. She was born six weeks early and weighed 6lb.

'My consultant said the surgery usually would have killed the other embryo and induced a miscarriage,' Miss Martin added. 'So it is truly miraculous that Emmie is alive.'
