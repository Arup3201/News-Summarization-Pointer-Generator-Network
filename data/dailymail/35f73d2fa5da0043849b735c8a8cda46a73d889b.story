A young British holiday-maker fell to her death from a hotel balcony just hours after arriving at a Spanish resort for a long weekend.

Charlotte Faris, 23, checked into a budget hotel in Magaluf on the island of Majorca with a female friend before going out for the night.

But after returning in the early hours of Saturday morning, Miss Faris plunged 30ft from a third floor balcony of the hotel, landing head first. Paramedics spent 20 minutes fighting to save her but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

It is thought she lost her balance and went over the railings of the four-storey building at around 4.30am.

Miss Faris is the third Briton to die in a balcony fall in as many weeks on the island. Roofer Benjamin Harper, 28, died on April 20 after falling from the fifth floor of his hotel in Magaluf. His father said he had leaned over a balcony as he smoked a cigarette.

And three days earlier Adam Atkinson, 20, died following a fall in the stairwell of his hotel. Witnesses said he had been drinking heavily.

The latest tragedy happened at the adults-only Teix Hotel in the heart of the resort’s entertainment district.

A guest at the hotel said: ‘Both women looked as if they’d had a drink when they checked in and they looked a little inebriated when they returned a few hours later.

‘They weren’t staggering but you could tell they’d had a few drinks. They went up to their rooms and a few moments later the woman fell from her terrace on to the street running outside the hotel door.

‘Her friend rushed down moments later but there was nothing either of them could do. The pal was totally distraught. It was awful to see. She checked out with her friend’s luggage on Saturday and took an early flight home. She made a statement to investigators before leaving.’ The women had been due to return to Britain today.

Miss Faris is a former pupil of Monk’s Walk School in Welwyn Garden City. A family friend  said she wanted to become a police officer.

Her mother, Sarah, of Codicote, Hertfordshire, is divorced from her father, Nicholas, who lives in Northampton. They released a statement yesterday, saying: ‘Charlotte was a very loving and much loved daughter, sister, granddaughter and friend.

‘She will be greatly missed by  everyone who knew her. We are still trying to come to terms with our devastating loss.’ Spanish investigators refused to comment yesterday but a source said the tragedy  happened while Miss Faris’s friend was in the bathroom.

The Foreign Office last night  confirmed it was providing  consular assistance to the dead  woman’s family.
