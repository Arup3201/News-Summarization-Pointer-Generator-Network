Felipe Massa is hoping his luck has finally turned after ending his 26-race drought without a podium in Sunday's Italian Grand Prix.

Behind a Mercedes one-two spearheaded by Lewis Hamilton, Massa was the best of the rest, claiming his first top-three spot since joining Williams at the start of this year, and first since the Spanish GP in May last year.

The fact it came at Monza, on home soil of Ferrari, a team he spent eight years with prior to switching to Williams, only added to the significance for the 33-year-old Brazilian.

Finally: Felipe Massa celebrates his long-overdue podium finish at Monza 

In a season when Massa has endured some wretched luck on occasion, and after watching team-mate Valtteri Bottas claim four podium finishes in five grands prix prior to Sunday's race, his result was long overdue.

'I've not been very lucky in some of the races this season,' said Massa.

'But the luck is on our side I'm sure now, and from now to the last race we're going to be there fighting.

'I'm so happy to be on the podium, and there's a lot more to come.'

With Bottas fourth, Williams have now leapfrogged Ferrari in the battle for third place in the constructors' championship, and the multi-million pound windfall that would come with that.

Support: Brazilian flags were among those cheering on the podium finish 

It has been a remarkable turnaround this year for Williams who, with 177 points to their name so far this campaign, have scored more this season than in the past four combined since the new scoring system was introduced.

Massa added: 'It's amazing to see how Williams were last year and now we are fighting with big teams.

'It's really good for the whole team, and I really hope we can get this third place in the constructors' championship, which would be fantastic for the whole team.'

Massa, though, dismissed suggestions his result and performance on Ferrari territory was a message to his former employers.

'I had an incredible time with Ferrari who are in my heart, and they will always be there,' said Massa.

'But I'm not driving for Ferrari any more, we (Williams) are fighting against them, Red Bull, Mercedes, and we need to do everything we can to be in front of them.

'We did a fantastic job to be on the podium, so it's a message we're competitive, that we are there, that we are fighting.'
