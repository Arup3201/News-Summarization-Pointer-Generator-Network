A 22 st actress has lost eight stone after fearing her frame would hold her back from being cast as Tinkerbell.

Kate Gilbert, 34, from Solihull, Warks, has slimmed to an incredible size 12 so she can slip into floaty dresses and wings for her dream role in the Peter Pan pantomime.

And now the impish star, who is part of amateur drama group Union Theatre Solihul, is set to star as the fairy this December.

Kate, who has been part of the group for 12 years, struggled with her weight for a long time, especially since her hip replacement five years ago.

The events manager said: 'I knew that it might be a struggle to convince directors that I was fitting to be cast as fairy when I was stomping around on the stage.

'Now I've never felt or looked better and I'm a much better fit for the Tinkerbell costume!'

For years, Kate had been consigned to roles for women many years her senior.

Her extra pounds meant she couldn't pass for characters her own age and she ended up masquerading as the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and the Red Queen in Alice and Wonderland.

Desperate to prove that she had the looks as well as the voice to match the character, Kate began an impressive diet focussed on curbing carbs.

She used to struggle to fit into public toilets and fitting rooms in shops

She went from indulging in multipacks of sweets and crisps every single day to not touching carbohydrates at all and ditching sugary snacks.

Kate also returned to horse riding and now spends hours every week mucking out, riding, and tending for horses at her local stables. Her husband is also delighted with her achievement.

She said: 'I used to struggle to fit into public toilets and fitting rooms in shops - it was so embarrassing.

'If someone had parked too close to me in a car park I risked getting stuck and found myself climbing in over the passenger side.

'I knew I had to take action especially because there were some roles that I hadn't got because of my size.

'Despite my weight I was getting strong roles and my singing voice was strong. But when I was a lot heavier I looked a lot older, so I ended up playing women who are meant to be twice my age.

'I can dance without being out of breath and run around the stage without worrying about putting my foot through a board.

'I look back and think, "how can I have let myself get that way?"

Kate said: 'I've done every diet under the sun - Weight Watchers, Slimming World, Lighter Life, Cambridge Weight Plan, even the cabbage soup diet - but never had much lasting success.

'Now I've managed to the simplest thing in the world, just cutting out carbs and exercising more, and it's worked.

'I see people squeezing between cars in car parks or struggling to find clothes to fit and I think 'That used to be me'.

'Now I'm the best I've ever looked and feel fantastic.'

Breakfast: Two cups of coffee 

Lunch: Two doorstep sandwiches with mayo, sweets, crisps, cake and a chocolate bar

Dinner: Large bowl of pasta with cheese cream sauce and extra cheese

Kate has done every diet under the sun but by cutting carbs and exercising she looks better than ever
