Lou Reed: A Vatican minister tweeted lyrics to Lou Reed's Perfect Day - without realising they refer to drugs

Lou Reed - Perfect Day on MUZU.TV.

After a few of his followers pointed out the hidden meaning behind the lyrics, he appeared to backtrack and tweeted another portion of the song - quoting the Bible. There have been many interpretations of the song's meaning, ranging from drugs to a simple love story.

He wrote: 'Be under no illusion: God will not be fooled. You're going to reap just what you sow (Galatians 6,7 and Lou Reed in Perfect Day'.

The gaffe didn't seem to worry too many of his 57,000 followers however with one replying - '@CardRavasi when being catholic became cool. Thx for tweet!'

Ravasi, an Italian who is the same age as Reed was, is a Bible expert who represents the Roman Catholic Church to the worlds of art, culture, science and even to atheists and says he is a firm believer in the power of contemporary culture.

Lou Reed died at his home in Amagansett, New York, on Sunday at age 71 due to complications from liver disease. It was revealed the rocker had been struggling with the disease for the last year.
