Grief: Georgia Nah says she is struggling to come to terms with the deaths of two of her children from the Ebola virus

An American mother has told of her heartbreak after losing two of her children to the Ebola virus in the space of less than three weeks.

Georgia Nah's son Patrick Sawyer, 40, became the first American citizen to be killed by the virus when he died in Lagos, Nigeria on July 25.

Just a few weeks earlier he had been at the bedside of his sister, Princess Nyuennyue, 27, who was hospitalised in Liberia, where she lived with her fiancée and son.

Ms Nyuennyue died on July 7, a day after her brother visited her. Hospital officials did not test her for Ebola until after her death – meaning Mr Sawyer had no way
 of knowing he had been exposed to the virus.

Speaking from her Philadelphia home Mrs Nah said she was struggling to come to terms with her children's death.

She told NBC 10: 'I can’t stand it. I can’t sleep.

'Every day I think about them. I didn’t even know she was sick. My children were good children.'

Mr Sawyer, who worked for the Liberian Finance Ministry, was planning to return 
home to Coon Rapids, Minnesota, for two of his daughters' birthdays in 
August, fell ill on a flight from Liberia in West Africa.

Ms Nyennetue has been buried in Liberia. Mr Sawyer’s family are still trying to have his ashes flown to the states.

Mrs Nah added: 'At least send me something. To know that here are the death certificates, the results of the Ebola. I don’t have anything.'

Nearly 1,000 people have died so far in West Africa in what is believed to be the worst outbreak of Ebola in history.

Symptoms of the disease are similar to those of flu, and include fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and finally bleeding and death.

There is currently no vaccine or cure for the virulent disease, which has ravaged parts of West Africa and killed more than 900 since its outbreak in March.

The virus is spread by close contact with an infected person through bodily fluids such as sweat, blood and tissue.

A memorial service for both of Nah's children will be held in Philadelphia Aug. 23.
