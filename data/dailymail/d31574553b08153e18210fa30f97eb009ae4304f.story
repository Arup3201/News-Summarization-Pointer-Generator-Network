Tony Blair and Gordon Brown attended the service but left out of a back entrance of St Paul’s to avoid coming face to face with the families of those who died in Afghanistan.

Mr Blair, the prime minister who took Britain to war, and his successor left several minutes before the other guests, escorted by bodyguards to separate BMW saloons.

Relatives had reacted with fury last week when told Mr Blair and Mr Brown would be among the congregation, with one saying Mr Blair has ‘got blood on his hands’. 

Meanwhile, inside the cathedral, Labour leader Ed Miliband, was seen rubbing his eyes and cupping his head in his hand before he appeared to drop off to sleep. 

A spokesman for Mr Blair said he had to leave quickly to fly to an economic conference in Egypt. 

A Labour spokesman said: 'To suggest Ed fell asleep during the Afghanistan memorial service yesterday is categorically untrue. It is deeply offensive to both our Armed Forces and to Ed.' 

Out of line: Ed Miliband seems to duck down as he stands with Prime Minister David Cameron and Nick Clegg

Feeling tired? Mr Miliband rubs his eyes, cups his head in his hand and then appears to drop off
