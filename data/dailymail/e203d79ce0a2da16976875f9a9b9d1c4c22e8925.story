A schoolboy was fishing for tiddlers when he landed a record-breaking trout almost as big as he is.

Richard Ricketts, 10, was fly fishing with his father, Dai, when the monster trout grabbed his line.

Mr Ricketts filmed the 10-minute battle on his mobile phone and couldn't hide his delight when his son landed the monster in their boat.

Whopper: Richard Ricketts, 10, with the enormous trout he landed while angling with his fatherÂ 

It weighed 21lbs, a record for the reservoir in Wales where they were fishing. And it measured more than 3ft long - almost as tall as 4ft 10in Richard.

Richard said: 'I cast my line out and I left it out for about 10 seconds when the fish took the fly.

'Then it came to the surface and my dad said it was a 20-pounder and I got really excited.

'I said: 'Oh my God!' It was like, really big.

'I struggled with it, my arms were really aching but I managed to get in into the net and onto the boat.'

The film showing Richard battling with the beast is set to become a YouTube hit.

It starts with lifelong fisherman Dai, 44, exclaiming: 'Jesus, it's a 20-pounder!'

During the video Richard fears he is not strong enough to land the giant trout and tells his dad: 'I can't do it, I can't do it!

But father-of-two Dai can be heard on the film telling him: 'Don't worry, there is nothing to be scared about, just take your time.

'Lift your rod up, there he is! Lift your rod up!'

The pair were fishing from a boat on the Llyn Clywedog reservoir, near Llanidloes, Powys when Richard hooked the fish of a lifetime.

Proud Dai said: 'It was a great father and son moment - I'm glad I got it on video and I'm sorry about my language.

'I got a bit carried away but then what dad wouldn't?

Normally only trout up to a couple of pounds are caught in the reservoir and local anglers say Richard caught the biggest fish on record there.

Richard, of Aberystwyth said he can't wait to get back to school after the half-term holidays to boast about his terrific trout.
