From glowing skylines to a city perched 12,000 feet in the air, these cities are among the seven most incredible urban hubs in the world.

Beirut, in Lebanon, the Cuban capital of Havana and La Paz, in Bolivia, have been named among the seven most incredible cities in the world.

The honour comes courtesy of the New7Wonders Cities - an initiative to identify the top urban centres on Earth - and follows the campaign to find the seven modern wonders of the world as well as the seven natural wonders.

Despite its history of unrest, Beirut, Lebanon, was named one of the 'seven city wonders' of the world

Public voting has determined the most incredible cities in the world - thanks to the New7Wonders Cities campaign. Pictured: Pigeon Rocks in Beirut, Lebanon

Doha, Qatar - and its famed skyline - were named another of the final seven New7Wonders Cities

Created by Swiss-born filmmaker, Bernard Weber, the campaign hopes to encourage debate about how cities to respond to challenges of the future.

Weber hoped that the voting process, from which 28 cities were whittled down to 7 finalists, would create a 'forum for discussing everything from urban planning to metropolitan governance, from tourism to architecture.'

This is the third time Weber has set out to find the seven 'best.' 

In 2007, he received over 100 million votes when he asked which seven world wonders were the greatest. 

In 2011, he began the hunt for the best natural wonders.

Voting for final seven cities first began in October 2013, when 28 finalists were voted down to 21. 

From July 2014 until October 2014, the 21 were further reduced to 14 - with the final 7 announced on December 7, 2014 in Dubai.

Weber recorded a video to announce the winners, naming the top seven cities in alphabetic order.

The beachfront city of Durban, South Africa, also made the final cut. Pictured: Golden Mile beach

Havana, Cuba, with its old world charm, was another city to top Bernard Weber's list

The booming metropolis of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, likewise did well in the yearlong voting process. Pictured: the Petronas Towers

La Paz, Bolivia, a city with some of its highest points topping 12,000 feet, is another must-see sprawl, which has recently welcomed the world highest and longest urban cable car system

Colonial architecture in Vigan, Philippines, meant that it was a no-brainer for inclusion in the list of the seven world wonders

'We began with more than 1200 nominees from 220 different countries and here have seven cities that represent the global diversity of urban society,' Weber told News.com AU.

'For the first time in human history, more than half of our planet's population lives in cities and this election emphasises the dramatically challenging character of our changing world.'

'Congratulations to all the new 7Wonders cities.

'You have the challenges of the future.'
