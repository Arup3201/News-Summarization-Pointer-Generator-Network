Felix Magath has refused to rule out a role in a restructured management team at Rangers.

A three-time Bundesliga-winning coach with Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg, the German legend purchased 810,000 shares in the Ibrox club in January.

And Magath has proxied his stake to the Rangers Supporters Trust ahead of a General Meeting Thursday which is expected to sweep the current board from power.

Magath has not had a job since being sacked from Championship side Fulham last year 

The appointment of a new football management set-up will be a priority thereafter, with Magath touted for a technical director role at the club.

Out of work since leaving Fulham in September, the 61-year-old declined to close the door on a job at Rangers, telling Sportsmail: ‘I would not rule it out.

‘I don’t know. At the moment I am fine. I follow things at Rangers closely. We have to wait for Friday then we will see what is happening.

‘I am keeping in touch with things, for sure. I am interested in the situation at Rangers because I have bought shares, so of course I have an interest. But I’m not involved as such. I have an interest, but I am not there. I am just waiting for the result of the vote on Friday like other people.’

Caretaker boss Kenny McDowall has already tendered 12 months’ notice and admits Saturday’s trip to Cowdenbeath could be his final game in charge.

Asked if it could be his last stand, McDowall said: ‘It could very well be, but I could have said that right from the start.

‘This is probably my last game, but I have handed my notice in and have 10 months or so to do and if I need to be here for the 10 months I have said all along that’s what I will do. Whether I am in charge or coaching — if the club need me I am here.’

McDowall has warned supporters that, even if King and allies Paul Murray and John Gilligan do claim the keys to Ibrox, it could still take five years to rebuild the shattered club.

‘I think fans understand the need to be patient,’ said the former No2 to Ally McCoist, ‘because they know what has gone on here. It won’t be overnight.

‘At least five years I think, until it can be what it was. The whole infrastructure has got to be looked at. It has pretty much been decimated over the last four years.

‘This is a long-term project, it’s not going to be fixed overnight. No chance. That’s why it’s so important whoever comes in that they get it right.’
