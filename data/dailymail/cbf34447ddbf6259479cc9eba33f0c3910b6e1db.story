The great debate on how one of the world's biggest sporting brands is announced has finally been cleared up, by the head of Nike himself.

Philip Knight, the chairman of the board of directors at Nike, was sent a letter asking him to circle whether Nike is pronounced as 'Nike' or 'Nikey'.

Ben Martin and Kendal Peters, who sent the letter, posted a photo of the returned sheet where the latter is circled.

Pushing the envelope: The letter the students sent to the head of Nike, asking for clarification

What do you think, Jordan? People have debated for years whether to say 'Nike' or 'Nikey'

The pair, both creative advertising students, wrote to Sportsmail to say: 'We had had this friendly bet between us for a while now and decided to write to Phillip Knight to once and for all settle one of life's biggest unanswered questions.

'We included a stamped addressed envelope inside the letter so that he could simply circle the answer and send it back to enlighten us all. We didn't actually think that he would do it. But all credit to him, a few weeks later the letter returned!'

Nike was founded in 1964 and gone on to become one of the biggest sporting brands in the world.Â
