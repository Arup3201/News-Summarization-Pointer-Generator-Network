The former Wallabies business manager who quit her role after receiving crude text messages from  star player Kurtley Beale previously attempted to sue an employer for $600,000 after being bitten by a spider.

Di Patston took out a lawsuit against Maroochy Shire Council, on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, in 2008 after she was allegedly bitten after making coffee.

Ms Patston's lawyers claimed her injuries were the result of 'negligence and or breach of contract and breach of duty of carel', in the legal claim lodged with the Queensland Supreme Court, the Sydney Morning Herald revealed.

She was working as an administrative officer for the council in 2003 when the alleged injury occurred and claimed that it caused her major depressive episodes, panic and lymphoedema, a lymphatic obstruction that can cause swelling.

The former Wallabies business manager is now at the centre of a controversy surrounding Kurtley Beale 

The Sydney Morning Herald reports the matter was settled in 2010 but Ms Patston received far less than $600,000.

Now, 11 years later, she is at the centre of a controversy surrounding  Beale.

On Monday, the emotional anguish felt by Ms Patston was revealed following the news that she quit her role on Friday  following a mid-air row with Beale last month.

The full text message exchange which sparked that bust-up and her leaving her post - and Beale being stood down indefinitely - was reported in The Daily Telegraph.

Ms Patston told of the hurt she felt at being the subject of the texts and asked Beale why she has been targeted.

'What did I do to you? I have barely known you a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this,' Ms Patston texted to Beale.

'Don't you think my job is hard enough with this?'

Beale replied four minutes later, apologising for the message, telling Ms Patston she had done nothing wrong and that he does 'stupid things for no reason'.

Ms Patston fired back that she wants the player to leave him alone. 

The emotional string of texts were exchanged in June while the team were in a Brisbane hotel before the first Test against France. 

The contents of Beale's offensive text messages about Ms Patston were revealed earlier this week, when a letter from the Australian Rugby Union to Beale was leaked. 

The letter, reportedly sent on Wednesday, referenced two messages containing photographs of 'extremely obese women', one with the message 'Di - who wants a go f***ing this?' The Sunday Telegraph reported.  

Ms Patston contacted Beale after she received the images, telling him, 'I can't stop crying.'

'I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female at this level,' she wrote.

'If I complain then I make it hard for women in rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake.

'Do you realise the situation I am in? Just leave me alone please.'

After a further apology from Beale, Ms Patston asked whether he was sorry for sending the message - or for being caught. 

Around two hours after their  exchange began, Ms Patston and Beale met to discuss the matter in a hotel room with three Wallabies players present. 

Ms Patston forgave Beale, promising to keep the offending texts secret - but swore she would only keep her silence if no other incidents occurred. 

After they met, she messaged him to assure him the ARU would not find out about the texts. 

'I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter... and how they would feel seeing what you sent me,' Ms Patston wrote to Beale after their meeting.

'I'll never know who you sent them to or why, but everybody deserves a chance.' 

'You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).' 

PATSTON (1:08pm)

'I am sitting here in the team room doing my job and I can't stop crying. What did I do to you? You have barely known me a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this. Don't you think my job is hard enough without this? This is how the only female staff member is treated? I am so embarrassed by this I am leaving for my room I can't stop crying thanks a lot.'

BEALE (1.12pm)

'We all see how hard you work for us. I just do stupid things for no reason... I hate that I have done this to you & I am so sorry di.'

PATSTON (1.15pm)

'Just leave me alone this is not ok. Do you realise the situation you've put me in? I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female and this level. If I complain then I make it hard for women in Rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake.' 

After Kurtley Beale and Di Patston met in a Brisbane hotel room 

PATSTON (3.44pm)

'Glad we got the chance to catch up and talk it through. I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter (all those things we discussed) and how they would feel seeing what you sent me. I'll never know who you sent them to or why; but everyone deserves a chance. You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).'

BEALE (3.48pm) 

'I can't believe you're not going to tell Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me & I have learned my lesson I promise you. You have been evry kind to me di and I'll never do anything like this again. Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve better you do so much & work so hard. Wish I could take it back. Thankyou di.'

The rugby star promised the then-business manager he would 'never do anything like this again.'

'I can't believe you're not going to Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me,' he replied.

'I have learned my lesson I promise you.'

'Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve so much more.'

However, Beale broke that promise when he verbally abused Patston on a flight from South Africa to South America last month, leading to Ms Patston's resignation due to stress.

The team was flying to Mendoza after their 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town.

Beale is believed to have made a sarcastic comment to Ms Patston when she asked him to change into an item of Wallabies team gear, which sparked a heated exchange. 

Beale, 25, was also reportedly involved in a verbal altercation with Ms Patston while travelling with the team before the side's loss to Argentina

The Integrity Unit announced an investigation into the matter and Beale was not selected to play against Argentina the following Saturday, which resulted in a 21-17 loss.

After Beale's second offence, Ms Patston is understood to have notified Ewen McKenzie and ARU officials about the offending texts Beale had sent four months earlier. 

Beale's playing future is in doubt, as he prepares to face two separate code of conduct hearings.

The first hearing will take place early this week, to exclusively address the text messages. 

It's expected the matter will result in the termination of Beale's Wallaby contract, which is due to expire at the end of the year. 

Wallabies captain Michael Hooper came out in Beale's defence on Sunday, saying the 25-year-old does not deserve to be sacked.

'I hope KB stays in rugby union and Australian Rugby Union,' said Hooper.

'We are backing Kurtley.I enjoy having him around the team and he is quality on the field.'
