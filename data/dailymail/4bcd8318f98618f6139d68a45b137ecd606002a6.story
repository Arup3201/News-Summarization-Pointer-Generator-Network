Sergeant Reginald Drake, who was believed to be Britain's oldest surviving prisoner of war, has died five days after turning 100

The man believed to be Britain's oldest surviving prisoner of war, who was held captive at the camp immortalised in The Great Escape, has died five days after turning 100.

Sergeant Reginald Drake was one of the few remaining British survivors of the infamous Stalag Luft III camp in Zagan, Poland, where 76 men attempted to escape to their freedom in 1944.

The airman was based there for 11 months, during the four years he was held captive by Germans during the Second World War.

Sgt Drake was captured in August 1941, after his bomber was shot down and crash-landed in a field during a raid in Rotterdam, Holland.

During his captivity, Sgt Drake endured forced marches across Eastern Europe, as the Germans moved prisoners from the Russians who were advancing from the east.

The airman, from Norwich, had already had a fortunate escape during the war, when the Allied POWs were strafed by British fighter planes which mistook them for Germans.

After the war, Sgt Drake worked as a local government officer. He was in good health until he developed pneumonia shortly before his 100th birthday. He died one week later.

It was only after his death that Sgt Drake's family suspected he might be the oldest living POW.

The previous oldest surviving prisoner 
from the Second World War had been Squadron Leader Alfie Fripp who died 
last year, aged 98.

Like many other veterans, Sgt Drake 
rarely spoke about his experiences of war.

But his daughter, Helen 
Britton, was able to piece together her father's war records with the 
help of the website. The family then approached the military genealogy website, Forces War Records.

Mrs Britton, 58, said: 'Over the years my father never really wanted to talk about the war that much.

'He was a very quiet and stoical man and I think that was due to the effect the war had on him.

'But last year we read about Alfie Fripp and we knew that dad was of a similar age to him and that he was a PoW for much of the war as well.

'Before he passed away he told us a little bit about his part in the war and we have managed to find out more information from genealogy website Forces War Records.'

Sgt Drake served with 226 Squadron based at RAF Wattisham, Suffolk, and crewed Blenheim bombers on raids on mainland Europe in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation of 1940.

Mrs Britton said her father could easily have been killed during the near-miss in 1941, just before he was captured.

The airman, from Norwich, was held captive by Germans for four years during the Second World War. He died five days after turning 100, after developing pneumonia

About half of the men, including Sgt 
Drake, dived for cover in a ditch on one side of the road. Many of the 
men who sheltered on the opposite side were killed.

She said: 'He found himself to one side of the crashed plane and he told us he overheard the other two crew members saying 'I think Reg has had it this time'.

'He got up, walked around to the other side of the aircraft and tapped them on the shoulder and said 'I am still here".'

Weeks later, during the raid in Holland, the aircraft in which Sgt Drake was flying made a belly-landing in the field. Although the three-man crew survived, they were all taken prisoner.

The captured crew would have then been interrogated for information before being sent to prisoner of war camps.

Mrs Britton said: 'I remember when dad and I drove back from a Christmas service at our local church a few years ago and Silent Night had been one of the carols.

'He told me it reminded him of his first Christmas in captivity when they apparently had little food and were frozen and the German guards sang Silent Night outside their cells to taunt them.'

Sgt Drake was held captive at Stalag Luft III  for 11 months, from May 1942. The infamous camp was where 'The Great Escape' - the single greatest freedom attempt by POWs in the war - took place

Sgt Drake was moved to Stalag Luft III at Sagan, Poland, in May 1942 where he spent 11 months.

In July 1944, he took part in a forced march west from a prison camp at Heydekrug in Lithuania to Thorn in Poland.

The marches involved walking for days on end with little or no food, often being beaten or bayoneted by their guards.

The previous oldest surviving prisoner from the Second World War was Squadron Leader Alfie Fripp who died last year, aged 98

Sgt Drake met his wife Vera before the war. They had to wait until 1945 to get married and went on to have three children - Clive, 66, Richard, 63 and Helen - as well as six grandchildren and a great-grandchild.

Mrs Britton said: 'I believe that Dad, after all his experiences of war, was very happy to have a wife who he adored, and family, and that providing stability for all of us was the cornerstone of his life.'

Tim Hayhoe, managing director of Forces War Records, said: 'Following a lifetime of silence on the subject, Reg Drake's daughter got in touch with us for information that her father had kept to himself.

'We found out the previous oldest PoW died on January 4, 2013 - he was a little over a month older than Reg Drake and the chances of there being anyone else between those two are fairly low.'

He aded: 'You can't underestimate the debt this country owes people like Reg.

'After the fall of Dunkirk, bombing raids on mainland Europe were the only way Britain could strike back at Germany for a while until the desert war and the eventual invasion of France.

'Bomber Command was one of the riskiest jobs of the war. Reginald Drake would have seen a lot of colleagues either killed, wounded or taken prisoner when he volunteered for it.

'We're losing a tangible link to the past every time someone like Reg passes away. It's wonderful to think someone who spent five years of his life, at a relatively tender age, suffering deprivation in the hands of the enemy not only survived the war but went on to lead such a long and happy life.

'Now he deserves to be remembered for what he did for the country.'

It is thought that Ernest Taylor, from Christow, Devon, is now Britain's oldest POW still alive.

Mr Taylor, who was held by the Japanese at the notorious Changi camp in Singapore in World War Two, has just turned 100.

The 'Great Escape' from Stalag Luft III was the single greatest freedom attempt by POWs in the war.

Among the 50 who were shot was Roger Bushell, the mastermind of the plot which hoped to free over 200 men.

Some 26 of the 76 who tried to escape were returned to the camp while three made ‘home runs’ to Britain.

The original plan was for three tunnels, codenamed Tom, Dick and Harry.  But Tom was discovered soon after it was started, and it was decided to use Dick to store the spoil from Harry as it was dug.

The story of the escape was made into a film in 1963, starring actors Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Donald Pleasence. Decades later, the 2000 film Chicken Run was based on the movie.
