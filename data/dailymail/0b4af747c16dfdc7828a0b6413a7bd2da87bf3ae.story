The body found in an Indiana lake on Sunday is that of missing Michigan doctor Teleka Patrick, an autopsy has confirmed.

A Porter County coroner today said the 30-year-old's body was pulled from Lake Charles in the state's northwest, near where her car was abandoned along Interstate 94 in December. Her body was spotted by a fisherman.

Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller 
said there were
 no signs of trauma or foul play, and the initial 
cause of death appeared to be drowning.

However an investigation is still underway to determine the cause of death, with toxicology results pending.

Confirmed: An autopsy has revealed it was the body of Dr Teleka Patrick, 30 (pictured), that was pulled from an Indiana lake on Sunday

Scene: Authorities say Patrick's body was found in Lake Charles, in northwest 
Indiana, near where her car was abandoned in December

Michigan authorities say Patrick, who was last seen on December 6, 
behaved strangely and erratically with colleagues and others in the 
hours before her disappearance.

She was last seen trying to get a 
room at a Kalamazoo hotel. She didn't stay there and got a ride back to 
her car at Borgess Medical Center. Patrick had been in Michigan since 
last summer when she started a medical residency at Borgess.

Grammy-nominated
 gospel singer Marvin Sapp, 46, had secured a personal protection order 
against Patrick in September.

Sapp, pastor of Lighthouse Full Life 
Center Church in Grand Rapids, alleged that Patrick claimed to be his 
wife, contacted his teenage children and had been to his home. He said 
she had joined his church after moving from California.

'She has moved from CA to MI,' Sapp wrote in part in the PPO request. 'Joined my church, contacts my children, and has been to my home.'

WOOD-TV
 reported that Pastor Sapp had filed the PPO order in September, and 
that he had 'over 400 page(s) of correspondence from her to which I have
 never responded.'

He added that Patrick’s stalking had gone on for at least a year prior to her moving to Michigan.

According to police, Dr Patrick worked a shift at Borgess on December 5 and had one of her colleagues drive her to the Radisson after work.

Both her purse and cellphone were found left behind at work, and surveillance footage at the hotel shows her trying to get a room with cash, but not having enough money.

In the footage, without 
audio, Dr Patrick talks calmly with the front desk clerk for about 15 
minutes before leaving after not getting the room.

She is then seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle back to her gold 
Lexus parked at the medical center - the last time anyone saw her.

'It
 was really sad to watch it because this is the last video record of her
 before she went missing,' Teleka's sister Tenesha Patrick told WWMT.

Just two hours later, Dr Patrick's 
car was discovered abandoned in a ditch on the westbound side of 194, 
more than 100 miles away in Portage, Indiana.

The keys were missing from
 the inside of the car.

Why was she there? Dr Patrick's family doesn't know why she was trying to book a room. Investigators later found she left both her phone and purse at work

No cards: Dr Patrick was caught on the hotel's surveillance cameras trying and failing to secure the room with cash

Dr Patrick was officially reported missing the next day when she failed to show up for work.

One of her colleagues told investigators that she received a phone call that day and that her demeanor changed after she hung up.

Dr Patrick's parents, who live in Florida, said she has a busy schedule but usually calls them once a week, usually on Sundays.

They did not believe that their daughter was in a romantic relationship.

Her family had asked the investigator handling another famous missing persons case, Mary Land, who disappeared ten years ago, to help find her.

Dr Patrick's parents met with Jim Carlin of Justinian Investigative Services in Battle Creek, which agreed to work on the case.

Leaving: The last time Dr Patrick is caught on surveillance cameras, she is seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle which took her back to the medical center where her car was parked

Accomplished: Dr Patrick (pictured left and right) had started her first year of residency in Kalamazoo after graduating from medical school last spring

Close to home: The hotel is located just five minutes from Dr Patrick's apartment

Her mother Irene told CNN: 'She has an outgoing personality ... she's a warm, friendly, lovely person to be around.'

She added that her daughter had just bought a plane ticket to fly to Florida.

'Who was calling her, what was that about, does that have anything to do with her disappearance?' her sister asked.
