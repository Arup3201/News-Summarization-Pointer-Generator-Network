A British soldier was killed in Afghanistan while on a daring mission to rescue a local police chief who had been kidnapped by armed insurgents.

The soldier, who has not yet been named but was from 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, was a member of a task force fighting to save senior Afghan police officer Abdul Walid.

He is the 417th member of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001.

Ongoing conflict: A soldier from the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, has become the 417th member of the British forces to have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001

Officials said Mr Walid, a deputy chief, was kidnapped at a police checkpoint in Payan village, in the Nar-e-Seraj district of Helmand province on Sunday night.

British troops with colleagues from ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) laid siege to the area and recovered Mr Walid.

But the soldier, whose next of kin have been informed, was killed by small arms fire and another British serviceman was injured.

The insurgents escaped from the area but ISAF forces captured one mobile phone, some of their documents and explosives.

Gulab Mangal, governor of Helmand province, applauded the British forces for their bravery.

His officials issued a statement saying: 'Helmand governor praises the sacrifices and bravery of the British forces that they rescued an Afghan police officer and sacrificed own selves.

'Helmand governor and the local residents of Helmand will never forget such a sacrifices of the British forces and offer own sympathy to the British Government for the death and injury of the British soldiers.'

Lieutenant Colonel John Kerner, spokesman for British Forces Helmand, said the soldierâ€™s death would be felt acutely in the war zone.

He said: 'His loss will be felt by everyone across Task Force Helmand and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.'

The soldier died two days after another British serviceman, from 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh, was killed in the same region.

Corporal Michael Thacker, from 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh, was shot dead in Afghanistan on Friday

Corporal Michael John Thacker was manning an observation post in the Nahr-e Saraj District when his patrol came under attack from small arms fire.

The 27-year-old father-of-one received immediate medical attention and was evacuated from the scene by helicopter but died of his injuries.

Cpl Thacker, who was born in Swindon, Wiltshire, had also served in Northern Ireland and Iraq and had completed two previous tours of Afghanistan.

He was described as a 'soldier's soldier' and 'natural leader' by his comrades.

His wife Catherine, who he lived with in Coventry, said: 'Michael was the love of my life. He was an amazing husband and father who will always be remembered as a funny, loving and kind man.

'Everyone who met Mike instantly liked him and through time came to love him.'

Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Webb MC, Commanding Officer, 1 Royal Welsh, said: 'Corporal Michael Thacker had all the attributes of a superb Royal Welsh junior non-commissioned officer and he was exactly the man that you would want at your side when life got difficult.

'He was a soldier's soldier - a larger than life character, highly competent, fiercely loyal and hugely proud of his family.

'He had a great sense of humour, banter was his speciality and any time spent with him was time well spent.'

He added: 'No-one ever left him without a smile on their face - he simply loved life.

'He was mischievous, fun, incredibly amiable and with a grin that would brighten the darkest of days.'
