Instagram has hit 100m users after less than three years in operation - and only a month after it reached 90m.

The retro photo sharing website passed the milestone a mere 28 months after it launched in October 2010, its founder revealed today.

Analysts said the achievement is all the more impressive as to sign up for the service users have to have an iPhone or Android device.

Instagram has 100m users, it was announced today.

Here's how it compares:

Facebook: One billion users

Twitter: 500m users

Google+: 135m

Linkedin: 200m.

Instagram only recently created a website so that users could look at photos on their desktop computers, reflecting the change in how people use the Internet.

Instagram now has one fifth of the number of Twitter users, its closest rival, but reached 100m far more quickly.

Twitter launched in 2006 and hit 100m in 2011, meaning it took five years to build the same consumer base.

In a blog post Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom wrote: ‘It’s easy to see this as an accomplishment for a company, but I think the truth is that it’s an accomplishment for our community.

‘Now, more than ever, people are capturing the world in real-time using Instagram - sharing images from the farthest corners of the globe.

‘What we see as a result is a world more connected and understood through photographs.’

Instagram is primarily a mobile service, but recently launched a website so people can see their pictures and those of their friends from a desktop computer as well

Instagram was bought by Facebook last year in a $1bn deal that made Systrom a rich man, but it recently suffered its first major setback in a row over its terms of service.

Instagram was forced into a U-turn when users complained that new rules would allow it to sell its images for profit to advertisers.

Since then there has been speculation that Instagram may be facing a backlash - but the 100m milestone seems to put that to rest.

The 100m mark is in the number of active users, or those who used Instagram at least once in the last month.

In just 40 days the figure has shot up 11.1 per cent - growth which has astounded analysts.

Facebook itself took just over three years to reach the 100m user milestone and hit it in 2008.

The social networking site was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard bedroom in 2004.

Twitter currently has 500m users, Google+ has around 135m and Linkedin has more than 200m.
