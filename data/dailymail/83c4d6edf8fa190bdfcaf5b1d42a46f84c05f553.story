Prince Ali of Jordan faces an uphill battle to prevent Sepp Blatter from winning a fifth term as FIFA president.

The 39-year-old third son of the late King Hussein announced on Tuesday that he was going to stand against Blatter in May.

The prince, head of the Jordanian FA, is a thoroughly credible candidate and one of the few modernising reformers with a seat on the FIFA ExCo.

But his chances of beating Blatter are a lot longer than the 10-1 being quoted by William Hill on Tuesday. Hills make Blatter a 1-33 odds on shot.

Prince Ali said: ‘I am seeking the presidency because it is time to shift the focus away from administrative controversy and back to sport. The headlines should be about football, the beautiful sport, not about FIFA.’

FA chairman Greg Dyke said: ‘I welcome Prince Ali’s decision. It is very important there is a credible candidate standing against Mr Blatter.’ 

Michel Platini, the president of UEFA, added: ‘I know Prince Ali well. He has all the credibility required to hold high office.’ 

However Prince Ali cannot even count on his own Asian Football Confederation who have pledged their support for Blatter.
