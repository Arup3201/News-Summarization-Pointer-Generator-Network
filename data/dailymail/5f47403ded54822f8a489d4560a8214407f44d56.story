A man on the run who is wanted for a string of thefts worth £500,000 has evaded arrest by allegedly ramming police vehicles in two motorway attacks.

Luke Wall, 23, has been on the run since breaching crown court bail conditions and is believed to be with his partner Teresa Connors, 20, who has also breached her bail conditions for burglary.

The pair have given police the slip across East Anglia, where the two attacks on police vehicles happened in June.

The first ramming incident came when Wall was pulled over on the M11 in Cambridgeshire on June 9 by a police motorcyclist

Wall is believed to have rammed his car into the police motorcyclist , knocking him off his bike on the motorway hard shoulder

The incident was captured on a body cam worn by the officer who was injured, but able to get up and call for back-up

Now the Crown Prosecution Service has taken the unusual step of releasing CCTV footage showing the attacks in a bid to apprehend the pair.

The first ramming incident came when Wall was pulled over on the M11 in Cambridgeshire on June 9 by a police motorcyclist.

Before he got off his bike the driver reversed into him then made off.

The incident was captured on a body cam worn by the officer who was injured, but able to get up and call for back-up.

Then three days later a vehicle stopped by officers on the M25 in Hertfordshire reversed into their patrol car

The vehicle reversed backwards as the officer went to approach the car, thought to be driven by Wall 

The police officer is forced to jump over a barrier to safety after the car attempts to ram his vehicle 

Members of the public can then be seen stopping on the hard shoulder to assist him.

Then three days later a vehicle stopped by officers on the M25 in Hertfordshire reversed into their patrol car, forcing one officer to jump over a barrier to avoid being hit.

DCI Paul Maleary of Essex Police said: 'We need to trace these two people urgently as they are suspected of continuing to commit burglary crimes after breaching court bail conditions.

'Extensive enquiries have been carried out across the UK but Wall and Connors appear to be always on the move. However, we believe they are currently somewhere in East Anglia.

'The CPS have taken an unusual step and agreed that we can release some of the CCTV footage of police vehicles being rammed to show how important it is that we find those responsible as quickly as possible.'

Anyone who sees Wall, from Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, and Connors should call 999 immediately or if they know of their whereabouts should contact Essex Police on 101.
