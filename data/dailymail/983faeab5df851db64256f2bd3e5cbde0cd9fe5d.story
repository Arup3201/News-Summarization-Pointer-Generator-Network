Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

After their season ended in La Liga disappointment, Barcelona are already working on the masterplan to restore themselves to the top of the tree next season.

Mundo Deportivo report their big idea is to strengthen the spine of the team, particularly in defence, with Valencia's Frenchman Jeremy Mathieu and PSG's Brazilian Marquinhos on their shopping list.

Core strength: Barcelona will try and sign Valencia's Jeremy Mathieu and PSG's Marquinhos to improve the centre of their defence this summer

Merry-go-round: Sport report that Barcelona have made a bid for Atletico's Miranda and that Cesc Fabregas could go to Man United

With Carles Puyol retiring and the ongoing uncertainty over Javier Mascherano, a centre-back is an essential first purchase for the deposed champions and they appear to be linked to quite a few.

Sport report that Barca have offered Atletico £16m for centre-half Miranda in order to fill the void left at the back.

Interestingly, they also have on the front page that Manchester United would offer as much as £43m for Cesc Fabregas as new manager Louis van Gaal looks to make a statement in the transfer market.

'Hot market' reads their headline as the summer transfer merry-go-round starts to gain speed.

The responsibility for carrying out this transfer business will fall to Luis Enrique, who was appointed as Barcelona's new first-team coach on Tuesday, signing a two-year deal. He will be presented to the media on Wednesday.

In Madrid, the summer can wait. They have a Champions League final to look forward to, involving the city's two biggest clubs.

Desperate measures: Atletico striker Diego Costa has flown to Serbia for placenta treatment on his hamstring injury, according to Marca

Up for the Cup: AS have an interview with Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who says he has already dreamed of lifting the European Cup again

Marca go with a line on Atletico and the 50-50 fitness of their key man Diego Costa, who has flown to Belgrade in a 'desperate' attempt to cure the hamstring injury that could force him to miss the match in Lisbon.

The striker has gone to visit 'placenta doctor' Marijana Kovacevic, who has previously worked with Frank Lampard, Robin van Persie and Vincent Kompany.

As, meanwhile, have been talking to Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who says he 'has more enthusiasm than when he won their eighth and ninth European Cups' and he has already 'imagined lifting the Decima [the tenth]' on Saturday night.

The stopper played in the 2000 final, when Real beat Valencia 3-0, and also in 2002, when they defeated Bayer Leverkusen 2-1.

In Italy, they're talking about transfers too. Gazzetta dello Sport report that Juventus have Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez at the top of their list and are close to reaching agreement on a £16m deal.

Overhaul: Gazzetta predicts how Juventus will line up next season, with Nani, Morata, Evra and Alexis Sanchez in their line-up

Close watch: Milan will move to bring Carlo Ancelotti back to Italy if Real Madrid lose the Champions League trophy, according to Corriere

In love: Juventus are really keen on taking Real's Alvaro Morata, either on loan or permanently, according to reports in Tuttosport

They add that Barcelona might pull something out their sleeve and ask for Fernando Llorente in return.

They've mocked up a pitch showing how the Bianconeri could line up next season, with Manchester United's Nani and Patrice Evra, and Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata leading the line.

You're restricted to 140 characters anyway, but Italy coach Cesare Prandelli has introduced a Tweet limit on his players during the World Cup in Brazil, presumably to avoid secrets leaking from the camp.

Corriere dello Sport say that AC Milan will await the result of Saturday's Champions League final with interest - if Real lose, they will try and lure Carlo Ancelotti back to Italy.

Also on their front page, fears from Juventus that star man Paul Pogba may fancy a change of scenery after just two years at the club.

Tuttosport say Juve are 'in love' with Morata but say that the Real Madrid man could arrive on loan rather than a permanent deal.
