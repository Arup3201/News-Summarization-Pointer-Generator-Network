Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is thought to be preparing to make a donation to the Labour party

Tony Blair is preparing to make a large donation to the Labour Party as it struggles to build up its election fighting fund.

The former Prime Minister, whose personal fortune is estimated in tens of millions of pounds, is in talks with Ed Miliband's officials  about making a major contribution to party coffers.

The Daily Mail understands from friends of Mr Blair that he is in discussions about the ‘various ways he can best continue to support the Labour Party’.

Providing cash would be one of the most welcome.

However Labour activist Jon Lansman said the party should not accept money from Mr Blair – who has accepted contracts from questionable regimes around the world – saying it was ‘not the cleanest’ in politics.

He added that Mr Blair’s client list included ‘the well-known democracies of Kuwait, Kazakhstan and Qatar’.

Friends of Mr Blair have tried to play
 down expectations of a possible donation, pointing out the huge costs 
associated with running his business empire and various charities.

A
 spokesman for Mr Miliband refused to confirm whether talks had taken 
place, saying: ‘Donations will be disclosed in the usual way.’ But he 
added: ‘Of course all support is welcome’.

Labour is set to lose millions after leader Ed Miliband was forced to weaken the link between trade unions and funding.

Affiliated union members will no longer automatically pay into Labour party coffers.

Instead, they will have to ‘opt in’.

The move will cost Labour £7 million if just ten per cent of levy payers opt in to paying, or £4 million if half do.

Mr Blair has previously made donations to Labour but his cash gifts have been small – just £6,000 in 2012 and 2009.

He also gave a ‘non-cash’ donation of £76,000 in 2010 related to staff support.

Lord Levy, Mr Blair’s former chief fundraiser, said Labour had no choice but to seek private donors.

He said that the reforms to union funding meant that ‘I don’t think they’ve got any option. Is it something Ed Miliband is in love with? No, I don’t think it is. Will he have to do it? Yes, I think he will’.

The former PM has already had secret talks with the party about making a ‘large donation’ according to The New Statesman magazine.

But the ongoing hacking trial involving former News of the World Editor Rebekah Brooks could make the donation controversial.

It emerged that Mr Blair had texted Mrs Brooks offering his support following the outcry over the hacking of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s phone. Mr Blair sent a message saying: ‘Is there anything I can do to help you. Thinking of you.’

Others in the party also have concerns that the Chilcott inquiry into the Iraq war has not yet given its verdict.

It could give a damning indictment of Mr Blair’s involvement in the 2003 invasion.

Relations between Mr Miliband and Mr Blair have thawed in recent days, after the former PM praised the union reforms.

Mr Blair said: ‘Ed has shown real courage and leadership on this issue. It is a long overdue reform that… was something I should have done myself. It puts individual people in touch with the party and is a great way of showing how Labour can reconnect with the people of Britain.’

A spokesman for Mr Miliband refused to confirm whether talks had taken place, saying: ‘Donations will be disclosed in the usual way.’

He added however that: ‘Of course all support is welcome’. Mr Blair’s office did not respond to the Mail’s queries.

It also emerged yesterday that Mr Blair 
has received £500,000 from taxpayers since stepping down as Prime 
Minister  in 2007 – £230,000 in public duty cost allowance from 2011 
until 2013, and £270,000 previously.

Gordon Brown, Sir John Major and
 Baroness Thatcher also received the allowance which reimburses 
ex-premiers for costs incurred fulfilling public duties associated with 
their former office.
