Police are searching for a man suspected of punching at least three people over the weekend in Cambridge, Massachussetts.

One of the attacks was caught on a Massachusetts Avenue furniture store's video surveillance.

The disturbing footage shows a tall man striding rapidly behind a couple on the sidewalk before coming level with them and punching the man in the side of the head.

Saturday stroll: The couple left BoConcept furniture store and turned right onto Massachusetts Ave

Stalked: The suspect can be seen walking up behind the unsuspecting couple

Both the man and woman were knocked to the ground by the punch.

According to the Boston Herald, the suspect yelled, 'Oh, you think that's funny?' before punching the man, and kept walking without breaking stride after the attack.

Another man reported that the assailant walked straight up to him at around 3:30pm, mirrored his movements as he tried to get out of his way, then punched him twice in the eye.

The victim had to be treated in hospital for his injuries.

A third man told police he too had been punched in the face with no reason and gave a description matching the suspect's.

All three attacks happened on Massachusetts Ave in the afternoon.

Ill intent: The suspect was heard shouting 'Oh, you think that's funny?' before punching the victim

Blindsided: The suspect walks level with the couple then winds back and punches the man in the head

Floored: The man and woman both fell to the ground after the attack

Police say the attacks do not appear to be an example of the so-called 'knockout game' in which people hit strangers, videotape the assault and post it online.

Investigators suspect the suspect was on drugs or suffering from mental illness at the time of the attacks.

Victims say the man was shouting unintelligibly when he approached them.

Owner of BoConcept, the store from which the couple had just departed when they were attacked called the attacker 'cowardly.'

Anthony Goodh told Metro that he's glad his store's surveillance cameras caught the attack on film.

'It’s terrible. You get paranoid and start looking over your shoulder to see who is coming from behind,' Goodh said.

'I hope they identify this person. If he can’t decide for himself that he’s doing something wrong, he’s got to be told so.'

Goodh helped two of victims after the attacks.

Multiple attacks: The suspect committed all the attacks on a stretch of Massachusetts Ave

'We ran out to help, brought him inside. This guy had a bruised ear and cheekbone. He was going ballistic. Then the previous victim came in. We helped him, too. He had a big fat lip,' he told CBS Boston.

The suspect is described as a tall black man in his 20s.

The owner of a nearby restaurant said the suspect had entered his business and made small talk with his chef before swinging at the man missing.

The chef gave chase and saw the suspect disappear up Ellery Street.
