David Petraeus' biographer-turned-mistress Paula Broadwell sent an anonymous email to General John Allen about Florida housewife and military social liaison Jill Kelley, as Broadwell suspected Kelley of having a romantic relationship with Petraeus as well.

The cyber love triangle expanded as it was revealed today that Allen was electronically connected with Broadwell after he received an email from one of her dummy accounts. He then went on to tell Kelley, a married mom that he denies having an affair with, who in turn reported the emails to the FBI.

Because of their respective involvement in the unfolding case, the Pentagon has requested access to the 20,000-30,000 pages of communications between Allen, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, and Kelley.

In light of the extra marital affair between Broadwell and Petraeus, Pentagon spokesmen have been quick to dismiss ideas of a similar affair between Allen and Kelley though their confirmation of some 'inappropriate communication' among those thousands of pages of emails has sparked further curiosity about the nature of their relationship.

One divulged example reported in The Washington Post was Allen's use of the word 'sweetheart' in referring to married mom Kelley, but a senior Pentagon official said that proves nothing as the 58-year-old general is from Virginia and the word is used in the south as a platonic phrase and not one demonstrating a romantic relationship.

Mrs Kelley runs in the same social circle as both Petraeus and Allen as she serves as an unpaid social liaison for the military and often hosts events at her million-dollar home located only a couple of miles from MacDill Air Force base. Allen served there from July 2008 to June 2011.

Allen, a four-star Marine general, succeeded Petraeus as the top American commander in Afghanistan in July 2011.

Regarding the nature of the emails between Allen and Kelley, an unidentified senior government official would not disclose whether they were inappropriate in a sexual nature or because classified documents were disclosed.

Denial: A government spokesman said that Allen never had an affair with Kelley

Both of those misgivings were found in the case of Broadwell, who was discovered to be the person behind the 'harassing' emails sent to Kelley and Allen.

Broadwell entered the fold when she began writing a biography of Petraeus, and at some point in November 2011 the two began an affair.

Petraeus was shocked to hear his mistress had been sending harassing emails to Mrs Kelley, who she saw as a rival for the ex-CIA boss' affections.

When Kelley told Petraeus that Broadwell was behind the emails, the four-star general told his biographer to knock it off, The Washington Post reported.

The
associate spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential 
conversations with Petraeus. The CIA director resigned on Friday after 
confessing to and apologizing for the affair.

Broadwell reportedly sent the emails from dummy accounts she had set up to Mrs Kelley, FoxNews.com reported.

Spooked by the bullying in her inbox, Mrs Kelley notified the FBI.

Victim: Jill Kelley, a family friend of Gen Petraeus, went to the FBI after she received the threatening emails

Mistress: Paula Broadwell's close contact with Gen Petraeus raised red flags among his advisers

A government officialÂ told the New York Post that the emails contained such language as: 'I know what you did,' 'back off' and 'stay away from my guy.'

The official added: '[Broadwell] clearly thought something was going on' and felt she was in a 'lovers triangle.'

What followed was an intense FBI probe in which Broadwell and Petraeus - both married with two children - admitted to investigators that they had engaged in on-the-side sexual trysts.

A senior federal law enforcement official told NBC News that the probe concluded on November 2, just four days before the presidential election.

The network reported that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wasn't notified of the investigation until Election Day.

Indiscreet: Aides have said Paula Broadwell posted Facebook postings about her adventures in Afghanistan that crossed the line into potentially leaking sensitive operational details

Insensitive: Paula Broadwell traveled frequently to interview Petraeus during his time in Afghanistan but sources said her immodest attire made her stick out like a sore thumb in the conservative culture

Skeptical: Those close to Petraeus were shocked the military chief placed so much confidence in Paula Broadwell since they say she lacked the credibility and credentials of a biographer

The emails were not the first time Broadwell had raised red flags while behind a computer.

Advisers
to Petraeus had become suspicious Broadwell due to her playful Facebook
status updates they claim disclosed sensitive details about military 
operations in Afghanistan.

She became a cause of concern back in 2009 when those in Petraeus' inner circle saw her lighthearted postings on Facebook.

Former Petraeus aides told the Washington Post that Broadwell's behavior at the time seemed odd and her closeness to the 
notoriously straight-laced family man was not without controversy.

Without
any specific examples of her Facebook postings, aides said they were 
stunned that Broadwell was so free to describe her daily movements in 
Afghanistan on the networking site, so her friends back home could 
chronicle her adventures.

Another social media no-no occurred 
when Broadwell posted a picture to her Facebook page of Petraeus with 
actress Angelina Jolie, that had been captured at his 7th floor office 
at CIA headquarters, where only the official agency photographer is 
allowed.

It is 
believed he had given the picture to Broadwell but the break with 
protocol was uncharacteristic for someone in his position.
