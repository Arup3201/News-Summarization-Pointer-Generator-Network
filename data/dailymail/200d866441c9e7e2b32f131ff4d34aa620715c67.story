Barbara Naughton, 32, an actress from Ireland, was a child when a visceral dislike of the way she looks set in.

Following an accident that left her with a crooked nose, growing up, Barbara loathed her looks so much, she couldn't bear to look at photographs of herself and even confesses to slashing them with a knife.

But after shelling out £7,500 for a nose job abroad, Barbara was left worse off than ever before after her Czech surgeon botched the job so badly, she is barely able to breathe.

Problems: Barbara says she has lost her smile because of the botched attempt at lip plumping

A supplementary operation to plump up her lips also went wrong, and as a result, the devastated actress says she has lost her smile.

'Every time I saw a photograph of 
myself, I just hated it,' she explains of her life before surgery. 'I used to slash a knife through that photograph
 and say, "that's not the way I came into this world!"

'I thought it would be better going abroad because it's cheaper and I thought you'd get the same quality of surgery.'

After paying £7,500 for her operation, flight and aftercare, Barbara travelled to the Czech capital, Prague, for treatment and agreed to an additional procedure on her upper lip after hearing its benefits extolled by the surgeon.

'He said "Your lip, I could enhance 
the top layer so it matches the bottom lip which has all the volume in 
it",' remembers Barbara.

Horror: Despite being assured things would improve, Barbara was left with a permanently swollen upper lip

Before: Barbara with the nose that she loathed before going under the knife in the Czech Republic

Improvement: Barbara has since had the strip of fat implanted into her upper lip removed

'So I thought "I'll try that surgery".' But the treatment, which involved grafting a strip of fat into the upper lip, was to have disastrous results.

'I woke up after surgery and I didn't 
understand why my whole face was covered,' she remembers.

Barely able to breathe through her nose and the owner of a pair of what Barbara describes as 'pulsating lips', she frantically questioned the surgeon about whether this was normal and was told that everything would be fine in a couple of months' time.

'I waited patiently for several months, 
isolated myself waiting for the big change to happen,' explains Barbara.

But nothing did. 'My smile was gone,' she adds.
 'My nostrils were as wide as a pig's nose. I thought, "What in God's 
name has happened to me?"'

Commenting on the case, Niall Kirkpatrick, a consultant cranio-facial surgeon based in London, says that experiences like Barbara's are all too common.

'Laws abroad are very different to in the
 UK,' he explains. 'It's a sad fact that cosmetic surgery is not well regulated in this
 country, let alone abroad.'

In a bid to fix the damage, Barbara travelled back to Prague to confront the bungling surgeon and was offered a second cut-price operation - which once more had terrible results.

Now £9,000 in the red, Barbara says she's furious about what happened and claims the surgeon betrayed the trust she placed in him.

'I don't have my smile anymore,' she adds. 'I put my
 trust and faith in the clinic and they've betrayed my trust.

'Thinking
 about the amount of time I have spent over the last few years running 
around in circles, getting injections, looking at my lip bleeding... I just want to live a normal life again.'

Barbara appears on Botched Up Bodies Abroad, tonight at 10pm on Channel 5
