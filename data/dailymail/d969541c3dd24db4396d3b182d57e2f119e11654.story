Change: Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, said the benefits system has created welfare 'ghettoes'

Conservative welfare reforms are part of an 'historic mission' in the tradition of the fight to end slavery, Iain Duncan Smith claimed today.

The
 Work and Pensions Secretary said his determination to cut benefits and 
get people back to work is like the work of William Wilberforce who 
campaigned for the end of the slave trade and Lord Shaftesbury, who 
enacted laws to protect women and children in Victorian factories.

He said middle-class families have been 
shocked by the reality of the ‘twilight world’ of Britain’s welfare 
‘ghettos’.

And in a clear reference to the Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street, the 
Work and Pensions Secretary said that under Labour the ‘middle-class 
majority were largely unaware of the true nature of life on some of our 
estates’.

‘Even
 now, for the most part, they remain out of sight – meaning people are 
shocked if and when they are confronted with the reality,’ Mr Duncan 
Smith added.

Signalling further welfare reforms that 
will be central to the Conservative election manifesto, he also 
cautioned colleagues that ‘casual disapproval of those on benefits is 
too easy’, pointing out that generations of politicians created the 
system that now traps claimants.

In a major speech he
 said: 'Reform, often overused, is in reality about transformation and 
life change, improving people’s lives through the choices they make: a 
journey from dependence to independence.

'As
 Conservatives, that is part of our Party’s historic mission. Just look 
at Wilberforce and Shaftesbury: to put hope back where it has gone, to 
give people from chaotic lives security through hard work, helping 
families improve the quality of their own lives.

The Conservative party must not keep 'finger-wagging' at people it disagrees with, Iain Duncan Smith said today.

He
 said he backed Treasury minister Nicky Morgan who this week warned the 
party would not woo female voters if it only talked about what it 
'hates'.

She said the party
 must not just say: ‘We're against this, we're anti-that, we don't like 
them, we don't want them here, we don't want them doing this.'

She
 added: ‘If we talk about what we hate all the time, we're not talking 
about we like and what we want to do to help people who want to do well.

Mr
 Duncan Smith said he agreed with the remarks. He told BBC Radio 4's 
World At One: 'I’m in favour of talking about what we believe will 
improve life, not always finger-wagging, my point about welfare reform 
is it’s positive life change.

'It's about getting people back into the mainstream, getting them back with that hope, that security.'

'Shaftesbury
 and Wilberforce were people who faced a massive problem, a social 
problem, and saw only the need to change it, and embarked on that change
 against the vested interests and accepted wisdom of their age, and the 
results you can see were massive and transformational.'

Benefits
 Street, the Channel 4 programme about the lives of benefit claimants on
 a Birmingham street, has provoked a fierce debate about the welfare 
state.

Mr Duncan Smith argued that Britain ‘will only be great again if all in our society are part of our economic recovery and growth’.

Yesterday, the Bank of England gave an unusual endorsement of the Government’s claim that its reforms – including a new £26,000-a-year cap on benefits paid to any one household – are encouraging people to get work.

With official figures showing employment at a record 30.15million after the biggest ever quarterly increase, the Bank said: ‘A tightening in the eligibility requirements for some state benefits might also have led to an intensification of job search.’

Speaking yesterday, Mr Duncan Smith 
described the jobs figures as extraordinary. ‘I believe the welfare 
reforms this Government has introduced – including, like the Bank of 
England mentioned, the tightening in the eligibility requirements for 
some state benefits – have contributed to this positive labour market 
story,’ he said.

‘The long-term economic plan and the 
reforms we’ve introduced are playing an important part in helping people
 off benefits and into work.

In
 a speech in London today to mark the tenth anniversary of the Centre 
for Social Justice, the think tank he set up in opposition, Mr Duncan 
Smith  insisted that the Tories ‘would have wanted to reform the welfare
 state even if we had no deficit’.

‘As Conservatives, we should hate the idea of people with unfulfilled potential languishing on welfare,’ he said.

‘Welfare
 reform is fundamentally about opportunity and life change, cutting the 
cost of social failure by transforming the life chances and outcomes of 
those on benefits – restoring fiscal stability, and restoring lives at 
the same time.’

Controversial: The Channel 4 programme Benefits Street has provoked a fierce debate about the welfare state

He believes millions were left locked in a life of dependency with ‘no incentive to aspire for a better life’.

In the worst cases, the current system ‘makes criminals out of those trapped in its clutches’ as people choose to work in the ‘shadow economy’ because they fear benefits being withdrawn if they do so legitimately.

Under Labour, despite the economic 
boom and a 60 per cent increase in welfare spending, income inequality 
was the worst for a generation, Mr Duncan Smith will add.

‘In
 neighbourhoods blighted by worklessness, where gangs were prevalent, 
debt and drugs the norm, families broken down, those living there had 
one thing in common; they were for the most part dependent on the state 
for their daily needs,’ he said. ‘For too long we let these problems be 
ghettoised as though they were a different country.’

The welfare system became ‘distorted’ and was too often an entrapment rather than the safety net it was intended to be.

‘And at its very worst, the present system makes criminals out of those trapped in its clutches,’ he said. ‘Faced with losing up to 94 pence of every pound they earn because of how benefits are withdrawn, too many end up in the shadow economy or working cash in hand.

‘Such behaviour can never be condoned, but it is a tragic state of affairs – and a mark of how far the current system has failed – that people should feel pushed into crime by having their aspirations to make a living penalised.

‘Surely the system should deliver for people who want to work hard and play by the rules.’

The star of Benefits Street rang Nick Clegg yesterday – and revealed that she was a Labour supporter.

But ‘White Dee’, the self-styled ‘mum’ of the Birmingham street, pictured below, said she might be persuaded to back the Liberal Democrats.

Dee – real name Deirdre Kelly – rang Mr Clegg’s radio phone-in show to ask if he thought the documentary was a ‘fair  reflection’ of people on benefits.

The Deputy Prime Minister admitted he had not watched the Channel 4 series yet, but was committed to reforming welfare.

After she told him she was ‘very into  politics’ and always voted, the 42-year-old told Mr Clegg: ‘The last time I voted it was Labour because I was really annoyed when you went into coalition with the Tories.

'But hey-ho, you can win me back, Mr Clegg. You can attempt to win me back.’

Miss Kelly later confirmed she had voted Labour in a local election. She goes by the name ‘White Dee’ to distinguish her from a neighbour ‘Black Dee’, whose real name is Samora Roberts.

Yesterday she invited Mr Clegg, pictured below, to visit the residents of James Turner Street after calling his show Call Clegg on LBC radio. ‘He would see a very clean street,’ she said.

‘He would see people getting together, helping each other – not scrounging – and children at school. He would be very, very welcome.’

The series, set to run for another two weeks, saw 5.2million tuning in to Monday’s episode – but it has attracted more than 900 complaints after featuring scenes of shoplifting, jokes about fiddling benefits and growing cannabis.

In one episode Miss Kelly is shown using her knowledge of the welfare system to help her neighbours, of which 75 per cent are said to be on benefits, to negotiate the Government’s new welfare tests.

But she told The Lib Dem leader the show’s stars were ‘shocked’ by how they had been portrayed because they thought it was ‘a documentary about community spirit’. ‘I think it’s very cleverly edited’, she added.

Mr Clegg told Miss Kelly that ministers had to be ‘hard headed’ over welfare but warned against ‘demonising’ those on benefits.

‘Receiving help from the generosity of others shouldn’t be a permanent way of life, and that the incentive to work is the most important one of all,’ he said.
