A teenager has been accused of breathtaking arrogance and a 'lack of human feeling' after being caught parking across two disabled spaces.

John McNamara, from Limerick, Ireland, pleaded guilty  to parking in a disabled zone on January 4.

His defence solicitor Tara Godfrey said the married father-to-be was only going to the town's cinema to watch a film in the evening thinking there were no restrictions at that time and parked badly.

@Extremely sorry': John McNamara, from Limerick, Ireland, was accused of breathtaking arrogance and a 'lack of human feeling' after being caught parking across two disabled spaces (file picture)

'He thought it was alright to park in the disabled spot there at that time of the evening,' she said. 

Ms Godfrey said Mr McNamara had tried to park in one disabled spot but strayed into another.

However, after hearing the cinema had disabled access, Judge Patrick Durcan was enraged.

'In other words, he prevents two potential disabled patrons attending the cinema in two parking bays which are located close to the cinema,' he told Ennis District Court.

'The arrogance, the ignorance, the selfishness and total disregard for others is breathtaking.' 

The 18-year-old, who had no previous convictions, was banned for the road for five months and handed a 500 euro fine, the Irish Independent reported.  

The incident happened at a cinema in Parnell Street, Ennis, south-west Ireland. Mr McNamara tried to park in one disabled spot but strayed into another

Ms Godfrey said McNamara left school at 16, got married at 17 and has one child on the way.

'He doesn't come across as being a bad lad and he is from a place in Limerick where things would have been very tough,' she said.

'It would have been very hard for him to get to this stage without previous convictions.'

Ms Godfrey added: 'Mr McNamara has been honest with court, is extremely sorry and genuinely believed that as he didn’t have to pay a car parking ticket at this time of the evening, that he could have parked anywhere in the car park.

'I am asking for leniency. This has been an entire education for Mr McNamara.' 

Judge Durcan said: 'I would ask that Mr McNamara reflect on his attitude and chance his attitude to society generally.' 

The judge had earlier imposed a two-month ban on Iwona Zaton, of Ennis for parking in a disabled space in Ennis on January 14.
