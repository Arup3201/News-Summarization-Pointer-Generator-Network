A mother was today found guilty of child neglect after her two-year-old son died after drinking poisonous plant food she was using to grow cannabis.

Lauren Booth, 24, was cultivating the drug for 'extra cash' in her home in Huddersfield, using plant food commonly used in hydroponic growing.

Bradford Crown Court heard she was asleep when her son Aaron drank the toxic liquid just after midday on November 6, 2010.

Booth denied wilfully ill-treating or neglecting her son but was found guilty by a jury after two hours of deliberations.

She was granted bail while reports are carried out into her background and she will be sentenced on April 16.

The jury was told Aaron had not been fed and was probably extremely hungry and thirsty when he drank the plant food.

Thomas Storey, prosecuting, said 
information on a notebook and laptop seized from the house by police, as
well as Booth’s comments to Aaron’s father while their son was in 
hospital, showed that the plant food was being used for growing 
cannabis.

Aaron died 11 days later at Leeds 
General Infirmary after his windpipe disintegrated. He had suffered 
several other injuries, including burns to his stomach, pancreas and 
spleen.

The court heard that Booth and her 
partner were awoken by a loud thud at around 12.40pm on November 6, to 
find Aaron lying down with a brown mouth and lips.

Booth’s partner, who spent a lot of time at the house, ran across the road to borrow a telephone to call the emergency services.

By the time paramedics arrived, Aaron’s mouth and lips were purple and he was foaming at the mouth.

He was taken to hospital in Huddersfield before being transferred to Leeds General Infirmary (LGI).

The court heard that Aaron’s father, 
Mohammed Khan, who was no longer in a relationship with the boy’s 
mother, did not know his son was in hospital until November 14, after a 
friend told him.

That day he went to the LGI where 
Booth seemed more concerned about having to move her cannabis plants 
than her son’s condition, according to the prosecutor.

Mr Storey said: 'She told him that 
she and her partner had been trying to make some money by growing skunk 
in the house, almost seeming annoyed by the involvement of the police 
because they were going to have to find somewhere else to grow the 
skunk, seemingly not bothered about her son.'

The prosecutor told the court that the laptop seized from the house by police had been in use since August 2010.

Mr Storey said a forensic examination
found that videos giving tips on how to grow cannabis had been accessed
on it, and a Google search had been entered that said: 'How to use pH 
test for ganja.'

He said: 'The user of that laptop had
been researching the growing of cannabis in a domestic situation. It 
was something the defendant was aware of, if not an active participant 
in.'

A photo of a notebook obtained from 
the house was shown to the jury, with a page containing numerous 
references to cannabis and home-growing.

The blue plant food bottle could have been mistaken by Aaron as the soft drink Fruit Shoot, according to Mr Storey.
But it contained a highly toxic concentration of chemicals that would have been a fatal dose.

Mr Storey said: 'The cultivation of cannabis also explains the presence in the house of that liquid.'

The prosecutor said that Booth’s 
partner could have had time to remove any trace of cannabis from the 
house in the time between going to hospital with Aaron and police 
searching the home later that evening, as he did not stay in hospital 
for long.

Mr Storey said police found a 
cluttered house but Aaron’s room was empty, with black curtains and an 
open window on a cold November night.
