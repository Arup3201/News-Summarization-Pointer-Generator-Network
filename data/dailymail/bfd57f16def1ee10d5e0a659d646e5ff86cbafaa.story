Sergio Garcia leads at the halfway stage after a thrilling second round of the BMW Championship but worryingly for the revitalised Spaniard a familiar deadly foe has appeared in his rear view mirror.

Rory McIlroy was well off the pace but a marvellous finish of three birdies in his last four holes for a second successive 67 has left him just two shots behind.

Rory and Sergio has been a recurring theme this summer, of course, with the outcome to this point always the same. During the first two legs of his unforgettable treble, McIlroy defeated Garcia to claim the Open Championship at Hoylake and then the Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone.

Behind you: Leader Sergio Garcia has Rory McIlroy in the chasing pack

Now the pair could be set for another fabulous shootout this weekend.

Not that the pair have things all their own way. Sandwiched between them is American Ryan Palmer who shot a wonderful 64 of his own, while another home player Billy Horschel is tied with McIlroy for third place. These two have a bit of history themselves, since they fell out during the 2007 Walker Cup when McIlroy took exception to the extrovert Horschel during just a bit too much whoopin’ and hollerin’. Happily, they have since made their peace.

If he can’t win this title himself for the second time in three years, McIlroy would probably be the first to hope Garcia gets over the line. His brilliant form this summer is certainly deserving of a victory and you can see him being an absolute star once more at the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.

Driver: Sergio Garcia hits his tee shot on the 12th hole in Colorado.

What a joy it was to watch him dismantle this storied old layout at Cherry Hills with a consummate demonstration of craft and imagination for a six under par round of 64. Even when he played the odd bad shot – his second to the par five 17th finished in the water – he saved par with a majestic pitch that finished just inches from the hole. He had some deserved good fortune as well, most notably at the par four seventh where his second shot from 128 yards finished in the hole for an eagle two. The 34 year old also had four birdies.

‘It’s just been one of those summers where I’ve had some good breaks and holed shots like that one, so it has been great,’ said Garcia. ‘Obviously it would be wonderful to win a title as prestigious as this but there’s still so much golf to play before I can think about that. I’m looking forward to the challenge, though. Contending for titles is where you want to be.’

Charge: McIlroy finished with three birdies in his last four holes

McIlroy drove the 346 yard par four opening hole and birdied the third but thereafter his round appeared to be drifting nowhere. At the 10th he flew the green from 127 yards and gave his caddie JP Fitzgerald a thunderous look.

All was forgiven over a closing stretch that was the exact opposite of his opening round, when he had registered a couple of sloppy late bogeys. How often during this sublime summer for the 25 year old have we seen him respond to events on the leaderboard, and close the gap just when he needed?

It began when he rolled in a 30ft putt at the par three 15th and continued with an even longer effort at the 16th. At the par five 17th he took full advantage of his extraordinary length to find the green in two and two putted.

‘I’m a lot happier with this 67 than I was after yesterday’s,’ said McIlroy. ‘It meant a lot to finish so strongly and it has left me in a very good position.’

Tied fifth is Masters champion Bubba Watson while Rickie Fowler, another of the boys of this summer, is only five behind. Alongside him are three more sharp shooters who could certainly make a run at the lead this weekend – former world number one Adam Scott, American Jordan Spieth, and Swede Henrik Stenson.

US Open Champion Martin Kaymer is six off the pace on two under with Justin Rose on level par after a 71.
