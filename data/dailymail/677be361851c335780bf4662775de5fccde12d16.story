A college freshman has been given the devastating news that she is unlikely to ever walk again after being hit by a stray bullet during a night out with friends.

Martha Childress, 18, has been paralyzed from the waist down after she was shot in the early hours of Sunday while waiting for a cab in the college party town of Five Points, South Carolina.

She was allegedly shot by 20-year-old Michael Juan Smith who pulled out a gun during an argument with two men nearby around 2.30am.

Neither of the men were shot but one bullet caught Miss Childress in the side of her ribcage, causing her to collapse.

Miss Childress, who is a freshman at the University of South Carolina and from Greenville, is still recovering in hospital today but is aware of her devastating prognosis.

Martha's uncle, Jim Carpenter, told The State that his niece will likely never walk again. 

Mr Carpenter said: 'She knew when she came out of surgery. She told her parents she couldn’t feel her legs.'

He added: 'Sometimes she is lying there in the bed and thinking and trying to process what has happening to her.'

The bullet lodged in Miss Childress's spinal cord, damaging her liver and kidneys.

She is recovering from surgery at Palmetto Health Richland in Columbia, South Carolina where she has been visited by her parents and younger brother Workman who attends high school in Greenville.

She tweeted on Monday: 'Thanks to everyone who's kept me in their constant thoughts and prayers through this difficult time! The support means so much to me.'

She followed up on Wednesday that country music star Hunter Hayes had called to wish her well.

Smith was arrested at the scene after 
officers heard gunshots. The gun with which he allegedly shot the 
college student was a stolen weapon. 

Ryan
Ellison, 17, was arrested along with the suspected shooter on a charge 
of disorderly conduct after he appeared to be 'grossly intoxicated'. 

Police are examining surveillance footage of the incident.

Smith has previously been charged with first-degree burglary, grand larceny and trespassing.

The 20-year-old now faces five charges including assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.

The University of South Carolina is now warning students that the Five Points district near to the campus is not safe after midnight.

The message was announced on Tuesday after the shooting of Miss Childress.

The school did not tell its 31,000 students to stay away from the bars, restaurants and shops in the Five Points neighborhood in Columbia.

USC president Harris Pastides talked with city officials Tuesday about how to the make the area safer.

Pastides says USC students play a vital economic role for the Five Points area. But he said on Tuesday the area is not safe for people after midnight.

Columbia police set up a substation in the district in May. Authorities also added patrols and surveillance cameras, and made a teen curfew permanent in 2011.
