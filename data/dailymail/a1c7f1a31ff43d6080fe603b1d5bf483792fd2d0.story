This is the devastation caused to a family home after their fridge freezer was struck by lightning, sparking a freak fire which led to the hospitalisation of their daughter.

Jane Teesdale and her family had to be rescued by neighbours after the blaze tore through their home in Goole, Hull, East Yorkshire, in the early hours of yesterday morning.

The entire ground floor was destroyed by flames when, during a heavy thunderstorm, lightning struck their home - and is believed to have set the refrigerator on fire.

Damage: The entire ground floor of the house was destroyed by flames when, during a heavy thunderstorm, lightning struck the family home

The family were only able to escape after a quick-thinking neighbour put a ladder up to a first floor window, enabling them to make their way to safety before firefighters arrived at the scene.

Mrs Teesdale, her husband Peter and their son Isaac, 14, made their way down the ladder where they were treated for smoke inhalation by paramedics.

However, her 12-year-old daughter Elizabeth, who had called the fire service to the house, lost her footing as she climbed onto the conservatory roof from her bedroom window.

She fell onto the path below and was rushed to hospital where medics told her she was lucky to be alive.

A spokesman from Humberside Fire And Rescue said fire crews used two hose reels and breathing apparatus, as well as a thermal imaging camera to put out the blaze.

Now the family are hoping to raise awareness about the importance of having windows that can be safely escaped from in an emergency.

The Teesdales' home was not the only house destroyed by lightning over the weekend.

Two
 families away on holiday had a miraculous escape when their 
Gloucestershire homes were destroyed in separate lightning strikes.

One
 of the houses, in Hardwicke, was struck in the early hours of Saturday 
morning, with the lightning bolt destroying the roof and falling debris 
crushing a nearby Honda Jazz.

And twenty
 miles away, in Ampney Crucis, near Cirencester, a house was struck on 
Saturday afternoon as the huge storm swept across the Cotswold.

The
 bolt, as well as destroying the roof, started a major fire in the upper
 levels of the house, which destroyed the loft and gutted the upper 
floors.

Meanwhile,
 a bungalow in Solihull, West Midlands, was completed gutted by a fire 
sparked by a bolt of lightning and fueled by a burst radiator in the 
early hours of Saturday morning.
