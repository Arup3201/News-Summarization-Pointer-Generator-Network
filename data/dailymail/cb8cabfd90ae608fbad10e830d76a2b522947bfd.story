There aren’t many folk in football who know more than Mark Lillis about the peculiarities and challenges of caretaker management.

He is the annual solution of Huddersfield Town, the club who three times in as many seasons have turned to the same man to put out their fires.

Each time, he reduces his workload as the academy manager and goes to whip the big kids into shape. Each time, he knows there is something of the substitute teacher about this situation, which he has experienced an astonishing five times when you factor in stints at Derby and Stockport.

Once more into the breach: Mark Lillis has embarked on his third caretaker spell at Huddersfield Town in the space of three seasons following the departure of Mark Robins on the opening day of the season

‘You learn the post massively through experience — you have to make it clear: “I am a manager, not a caretaker — put that to bed and put the same effort in”.’

That was Lillis explaining how he addresses the class. ‘I don’t want people to ease off the gas,’ he added.

The 54-year-old was talking after Huddersfield lost 3-1 to Cardiff on Saturday, a game he never would have expected to oversee. By the standards of a man who has spent almost four decades in football, taking charge after one game ‘is a new one to me’.

It has been a strange few days at Huddersfield, starting with the 4-0 defeat by Bournemouth, then the staggeringly early departure of their manager, Mark Robins.

When chairman Dean Hoyle revealed late last week that Robins had actually walked away — not been sacked, as per the accepted wisdom — he said his former manager complained that the players were ‘gone’, as were the fans.

In form: Kenwyne Jones scored Cardiff's second goal in their 3-1 home win over Huddersfield on Saturday

What worse time, then, to face Cardiff, for whom another season in this division would be viewed far differently than it would at Huddersfield? What more appropriate time to face Cardiff, the club who have had their share of dysfunctional moments?

For Lillis, the fans stayed onside and, more importantly, the players did as well, even after Kenwyne Jones made it 2-0 and then 3-1. ‘Our spirit impressed me,’ said Lillis.

Those things matter to a manager, but especially a caretaker. He’s seen the lot, has Lillis, a former player for Huddersfield as well as Aston Villa and Manchester City.

He runs a good academy at Huddersfield and since managing Halifax for 60 games at the turn of the millennium has had no overwhelming desire to return to permanent management.

‘You have moments,’ said Lillis. ‘Don’t get me wrong, on Tuesday (in the 5-3 Capital One Cup win over Chesterfield) I enjoyed it. At 3-1 down people are shouting, “You’re getting sacked in the morning”.

Spirit: Murray Wallace pulled the scoreline back to 2-1 but Huddersfield were unable to get an equaliser 

‘When you get back to 3-3 and win 5-3 you get that adrenaline buzz again.’

His caretaker career has so far spanned 14 games across his five stints. ‘My shortest one was after Lee Clark (sacked in 2012). I didn’t get a game.

‘We had two days — a light training session on the Thursday, then an international break and the new man came in. My longest was last year (after Simon Grayson’s sacking) — we had five games, lost one, drew a couple and won a couple.

‘In these last few days I have felt comfortable with the group. The experience helps and I think that’s why the club asked me to step in. They know it is in decent hands.’

On he will go. At some point soon he will return to the work he really loves, but always ready to man the hose.

‘You just go on,’ he said. ‘Huddersfield know I will just keep going. You take one game at a time.’

Spoken like a true manager.

PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND

In the first instance, Charlton’s 2-1 victory over Championship heavyweights Wigan. In the second, the squabbling of the two managers after Franck Moussa’s winner. Charlton’s Bob Peeters celebrated in front of Uwe Rosler, before the two men had to be separated.

Peeters said: ‘I’m not going to apologise to him because he said things to me. Never ever.’

Over the top? Brentford manager Uwe Rosler thought this celebration by his Charlton counterpart Bob Peeters was too much, leaving to an altercation at the final whistle
