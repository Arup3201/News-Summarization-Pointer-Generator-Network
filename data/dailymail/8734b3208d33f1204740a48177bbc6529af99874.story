Career criminal Brian Fitch Sr. has allegedly admitted to shooting and killing veteran Minesota police officer and father-of-two Scott Patrick during a traffic stop on Wednesday.

Hours after the murder, Fitch, who was shot eight times during a shootout with police but suvived, allegedly told the officer guarding him in hospital: 'Just to let you know, I hate cops and I'm guilty.'

The troubling admission comes after the victims bereaved wife, Michelle Patrick, thanked the public for their support in the aftermath of her husband's tragic death.

Fitch fired at Patrick as the officer approached him during a traffic stop about 12.20 pm Wednesday on Dodd Road near Smith Avenue S. in West St. Paul.

He fired several times, shooting the patrolman in the head. The officer's gun was still holstered and buckled, according to The Star Tribune.

Fitch, 39, then sped off in his green Pontiac Grand Am.

The
 shooting sent cops scrambling across the Twin Cities metro area in 
search for the gunman. As cops closed in on him, Fitch reportedly told a
 family member: 'Watch for fireworks, it's gonna be the the Fourth of 
July,' according to St. Paul Pioneer-Press 

Officers
 spotted Fitch in his car with an unidentified woman in St. Paul about 
8pm. When a squad car cut off Fitch's escape route, he opened fire on 
police. 

Cops returned fire, wounding both Fitch and his passenger in a hail of bullets. 

'As
 our family struggled to deal with our heavy grief ... you, the public, 
reminded us that we carry this burden together,' Michelle Patrick told a
 crowd of about 100 who assembled at the place her husband was killed on
 Friday night.

'You provide us with the hope that we'll someday climb out of this deep grief we feel.

'He would love and appreciate all you've done for us.'

The couple had been married for 26 years and were high school sweethearts.

They have two daughters: Erin, 17, and Amy, 13.

Fitch was charged in Dakota County District Court with two counts of first-degree murder. 

He had three warrants out for his arrest when he allegedly shot Patrick in the leg, abdomen and head.

He
 was also charged with three counts of first-degree attempted murder, 
three counts of dangerous-weapon-drive-by shooting, three counts of 
second-degree assault and one count of possession of a pistol or assault
 weapon following the shootout during his arrest.

Mendota Heights, Minnesota, is one of the wealthiest suburbs in the country. Officer Patrick is the first cop to be killed in the line of duty in the history of the Mendota Heights Police Department

Fitch has a laundry list of convictions, including felony theft, assault, making threats, possession of a firearm, and false imprisonment.

Last year, he was convicted of burglary. 

Officer Patrick is the first cop killed in the line of duty in the history of the Mendota Heights Police Department.

He was the most senior officer in the force, having joined in 1995.
