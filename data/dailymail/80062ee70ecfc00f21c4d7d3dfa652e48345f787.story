Demarai Gray of Birmingham City is attracting interest from a string of clubs

Blues boss Gary Rowett is desperate to keep the young star at St Andrew's

Blues boss Gary Rowett is desperate to keep hold of the Birmingham academy graduate.

He said: ‘I’ve had lots of conversations with him recently, he’s never once told me he’s keen on leaving the club, I just think it’s one or two people trying to stir things up. 

'He’s our player, I hope he stays. I’m not too worried about any speculation. I prefer to concentrate on his performance.’

Meanwhile, Bolton are signing Lorient striker Alain Traore on loan. The 27-year-old Traore, a Burkina Faso international, can play as a forward, attacking midfielder and on the left wing.
