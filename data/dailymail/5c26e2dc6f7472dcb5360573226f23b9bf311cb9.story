Is this Britain's oldest PCSO? Officer Martindale-Vale turned 70 yesterday but isn't going anywhere

When most people hit 70, they prefer to leave their working days behind and enjoy their golden years. 

But retirement can wait for one former Navy man who refuses to quit his job as a police community support officer.

Ex-boxer Louis Martindale-Vale celebrated the milestone yesterday and could be Britain's oldest frontline officer, but he aims to be catching criminals for many more years to come.  

Officer Martindale-Vale, who lives in Great Barr, Birmingham, joined West Midlands Police in 2007 after been reassured by his wife that community policing would “suit you down to the ground". 

In a career spanning 54 years, the granddad-of-four has proved he can turn his hand to almost anything. 

He joined the Navy aged 17 where his role with the Fleet Air Arm saw him perform 'shore patrols' to keep hundreds of sailors in check as they roamed ports in South Africa and Hong Kong. 

He also worked at Land Rover, as a golf course manager and even as a grave digger.   

But now, his only concession is to cut down to part-time hours due to his age.  

'Working part-time was a 70th birthday present to myself,' he said. 

'Age is no barrier to a fulfilling career later in life. 

'I'm sure there are countless people - and maybe some who have already retired - who would make superb PCSOs.'

 He added that when he finally does retire he will move with his wife Suzie, 59, to the seaside town of Skegness, Lincolnshire.

'We've got our eye on a place by the sea up there but it's a little while off yet.'

Suzie, a retired carer, who has been married to Louis for 12 years, said: 'I told him he should get into community policing because I thought it would suit him down to the ground.

'Louis likes that sort of structure and keeping active so I said why don't you give it a go?

Louis joined the Navy aged 17 but his first application was rejected on height grounds. A year later, having grown half an inch, he was accepted

'And he's not looked back since.

'I think he'll just keep going as long as he can because he really seems to enjoy it.

'He's not told me when he'll stop so might have to put those plans in Skegness on hold for now.'

Louis added: 'Erdington High Street has been my office for the last seven years and I love the role.

'It's great being out and about, helping the public and working with retailers to tackle shoplifters.

'There's nothing more satisfying than helping lock up a pick-pocket.

'It may have spared an elderly person the trauma of having their pension snatched or a teenager losing their new phone.'   

Superintendent Jo Smallwood said: 'Louis is a shining example of how PCSOs can play an important role in our communities, building relationships with organisations and members of the public - people ask to speak to him personally, share their concerns and have confidence he’ll act to address any issues.

'It’s great to hear him speak so passionately about the role and, when the day does come that he decides to hang up his uniform for the last time, he’ll be sorely missed.'
