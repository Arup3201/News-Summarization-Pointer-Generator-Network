It looks like we might have found the future of housing - and that future is in Iran, where architects have designed an incredible seven-storey home with moveable rooms.

The Sharifi-Ha house in Tehran is already pretty impressive - it features a gym and a swimming pool, but what makes it extraordinary is how its outer rooms can rotate, creating space and also making it adaptable to the seasons.

At just a touch of a button, three of the outer rooms -  the breakfast room, the guest room and the office - can rotate out to overhand the street, letting light in and creating terrace space.

Twist and shout: The Sharifi-Ha house in Tehran has come up with an ingenious way of creating space - by having rooms which move at the touch of a button

Fancy: The huge, open-plan home is built over seven floors and features large living areas, two kitchens and leisure facilities

Each of the three rooms, which resemble wooden boxes from the outside, is on its own rotating base. During the cold winters they can close up, keeping the house warm, while during the hot summer months, opening them will ventilate the house.

The house has two basement floors, which house the gym and other leisure facilities such as a billiards table, the ground floor has room for parking and the housekeeper's living area, the first and second floors are the main living space, with the kitchen, living room and even piano area, while the top two floors have the bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as another kitchen and more living space.

It was designed by Iranian architects Nextoffice. A spokesman for the company said: 'The house adapts to the functional needs of its users.

Shake it up: The customisable home has two basement floors, one of which houses a gym, while there is also a swimming pool and parking space

Overhang: The breakfast room, guest bedroom and office can rotate 90 degrees, meaning they hang over the street, making up for the house's narrow lot

How it works: This floor plan of the house's outer rooms shows how the rooms rotate to create terrace space and increase ventilation

'Depending on whether there is a guest or not, the guest room - on the second floor - can be reconfigured for different purposes.

'Similarly home offices and breakfast rooms can change the formality of their appearance according to their residents' desires.

'There is always the possibility of having different seasonal or lighting scenarios because of this style.'

The house is inspired by the traditional Iranian home, which has both a summer and winter living room to reflect the stark difference in the seasons' temperatures.

Is this the future? Moveable rooms such as these could be important for the future of housing as space becomes limited

The home of design: Iran has three homes up for the 2014 World Architecture Festival Award, including the Sharifi-Ha house

It can reach a sweltering 50C in the summer, while in winter in it regularly well below freezing, so these rotating rooms definitely have a practical use and are not just for showing off.

The Sharifi-Ha house has been shortlisted in the house category at the 2014 World Architecture Festival Awards, alongside other impressive entries from the likes of Australia and Malaysia, while Garden House by De Motas Ryan is up for the award in the UK.

Iran is no stranger to futuristic homes - two others are also competing for the award, which means only Australia has more nominees, with four.
