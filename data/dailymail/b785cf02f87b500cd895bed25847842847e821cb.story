Kell Brook is willing to break with convention and give Amir Khan the lion's share of any payday in an effort to finally lure him into a blockbuster world title fight.

Brook has the bargaining chip of a world championship belt but so far that has proved ineffective in drawing the Bolton welterweight into a fight that would attract huge British interest.

Sportsmail understands Khan would pocket in the region of £4 million if he met the 28-year-old at Wembley on June 13 – a date Brook's promoter, Eddie Hearn, has penciled in with the national stadium.

Brook has gone to claim he would be prepared to accept a smaller payday as IBF champion to make the fight.

But despite sporadic positive feedback from the Khan camp, who told Hearn at a recent meeting in Blackpool that the bout 'will happen one day', the trail has since gone cold. Brook, who defends his title on March 28 against Jo Jo Dan, said: 'I think he is avoiding me like the plague. He said that I'm an easy fight but how long have we been banging on about wanting the fight with him? 'After I'm done with Amir Khan he will just be a mere memory.

'He wants to fight some of these kids who have been super-featherweights. I am a genuine big welterweight who can seek and destroy him.' Hearn added: 'We want the fight so badly. We don't believe we should take anything less than 50-50 but until we talk maybe we do. Kell has not been in a mega-fight and has masses of monster paydays in front of him. If he has to give Amir a little something to knock him out he probably will.' Khan's fight in Sheffield on March 28 will be his first since the horrific stabbing incident in Tenerife last September that could have cost his life.

At the very least it has meant a major delay in Brook defending his world title for the first time. He intends on three more fights this year, though he believes he has a greater chance of attracting the winner of Floyd Mayweather's showdown with Manny Pacquiao than he does of landing a Khan bout that would draw enormous domestic interest.

Khan's apparent interest in fighting America's Adrien Broner would indicate that Brook is low on his agenda, with Brook saying: 'I think it is more likely I will end up fighting one of Mayweather or Pacquiao than Khan, the way he is dragging his feet. A Khan fight is so easy to make. All the signs are there for it to be an unbelievable fight.

'I have seen clips of him saying, 'Win a world title', 'Do this, do that'. I have come through everything he has said and still nothing.

'I think people around him are blowing smoke up his **** and he is believing all the hype. Don't get me wrong he is a good fighter but I would take him out.

'We are ready to go with this fight. But I will fight anyone. I have only wanted to fight the very best. Before I leave this fight I want to get in with the best.' Hearn told Sportsmail earlier this week that discussions have started over a possible summer fight for Brook against Juan Manuel Marquez or Brandon Rios, who are both former world champions.
