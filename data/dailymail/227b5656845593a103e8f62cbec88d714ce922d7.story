He was a man who loved to lunch.

As such a custom made Land Rover given to Winston Churchill on his 80th birthday had to be fitted with an extra-wide passenger seat to accommodate his ample rump.

Now the rare Series 1 vehicle, which also features a special wooden box believed to be for the cigar-smoking statesman's bricklaying tools, is set to fetch £60,000 when it goes up for auction in October.

Me and my Rover: This rare series 1 Land Rover, given to Winston Churchill as an 80th birthday present, is set to make £60,000 when it goes under the hammer in October

The 4x4 was used to ferry Churchill around his sprawling 300 acre Chartwell estate in Kent after he retired from political life - and almost 58 years later still only has 12,000 miles on the clock.

The vehicle was used to tow a family’s horse box for almost 20 years before they put it away for storage - aware of its fascinating provenance.

It comes with a log book and tax disk emblazoned with Churchill’s name proving its previous VIP ownership.

Manufacturers also added a padded fold-down arm rest, a lather clad grab handle fitted to the bulk head and a specially designed foot-well heater - handy for those chilly Kent mornings.

...And how she looks now: Fifty-eight years later the custom made Land Rover is in good condition and still only has 12,000 miles on the clock

Provenance: The log book shows the signature of the Rt Hon Sir Winston Spencer Churchill. The 4x4 was used to ferry Churchill around his 300acre Chartwell estate in Kent after he retired from political life

Auctioneers expect the Land Rover to fetch more than 375 times the £150 Churchill’s relatives sold it on for, more than 15 years after his death.

Auctioneer Jeremy Curzon said: 'In view of Churchill’s position as the foremost statesman of the 20th century we expect a lot of interest.'

Churchill retired from politics in 1955, ten years before his death aged 90. The vehicle was then passed onto his son-in-law the Rt Hon Christopher Soames.

It was then sold off for just £160 in a farm sale in the early 1970s to a man called Norman Mills.He had no idea how to get the Land Rover home and asked friend Frank Quay to help him transport it.

For the larger person: The Land Rover was fitted with an extra-wide passenger seat to accommodate Churchill's ample rump, a foot heater and a special box said to be for his bricklaying tools

When Mr Quay, the current owner, looked at the log book and saw who the original owner was he immediately bought the car for double the price.

Bizarrely It was then used by the Quay family to tow their horse box for a number of years before being stored away in a shed for safe keeping.

Mr Quay believes Churchill used the wooden box, specially fitted into the pick-up bed for storing a trowel and mortar so Churchill could indulge his hobby for bricklaying whenever it suited him.

The car will go under the hammer on October 20 at Cheffins auction house in Sutton, Cambs.
