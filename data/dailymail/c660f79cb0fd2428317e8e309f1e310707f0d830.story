A 19-year-old who was diagnosed with cancer claims that when he asked his boss to take six-weeks off for surgery he was fired.

Jonathan Larson worked as a delivery driver at Rosebud Restaurant, an establishment in suburban Chicago until his boss gave him the axe.

Larson suffers from cancer of the brain and spine and requires surgery so he asked his manager to take just six-weeks-off. His particular type of cancer is called multifocal myoxopapilary ependyoma and he was diagnosed in 2010 but still muscling through it.

‘No, by that time I’ll already have another driver hired. Just leave, I have to make some phone calls,' Larson told NBC his manager said.

'I’m really disappointed and saddened by it. It’s not something I can help.'

Larson said he wants an apology from his boss because he feels like he is being punished for something he can't control.

'I would love an apology,' he said.

'It would go a long way to make me feel better about the situation.'

Rosebud Restaurant told NBC that they couldn't comment on personal employment matters, 'due to employee and human resources confidentiality standards.'

'For more than thirty-six years Rosebud has been successful through the hard work of our employees,' the statement read. 

'We are thoroughly investigating this matter to determine if our processes and protocols were appropriately followed. Rosebud proudly serves the Chicagoland community and considers it our mission to treat all employees fairly.'

According to a Facebook page dedicated to Larson's recovery, Larson has been on medication since 2010 and is in the final stages of his recovery.

Unfair: Larson has requested an apology from the manager at Rosebud Restaurant but no one from the restaurant has agreed to comment specifically on the matter
