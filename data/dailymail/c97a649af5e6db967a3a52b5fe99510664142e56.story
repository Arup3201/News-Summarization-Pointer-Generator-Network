Killed: Sophie Jones died from methadone poisoning after drinking from a Tom and Jerry beaker in which the drug was being stored 

A father has been convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter after she was poisoned to death drinking methadone which was being stored  in her Tom and Jerry beaker.

Sophie Jones was left to collapse under the effects of the heroin substitute several hours after an eye witness said she looked 'groggy' and was falling over, a court heard.

Paramedics rushed to the family home in Blackpool, Lancashire, but despite attempting to revive her, Sophie was pronounced dead in hospital just 35 minutes later.

Tests later showed Sophie had traces of four separate drugs in her hair - with three of her dummies containing traces of cocaine.

Methadone was also found on an upstairs bathroom sink.

A jury was told how Sophie's parents Barry Jones, 41, and Michelle King, 29, were both drug addicts and the methadone had been prescribed to King.  

But she had been keeping it in her daughter's beaker and Fruit Shoot bottles with a view to selling it on to fund her drug habit.

Both parents are now facing jail after Jones was found guilty by a jury of manslaughter at Preston Crown Court - with King having already admitted manslaughter and a further charge of child cruelty.

While Sophie was in hospital the couple tried to cover up the tragedy by hiding the beaker and Fruit Shoot bottles, the court was told. 

King sent two text messages to Jones relating to the child's drinking cup - one reading 'all the meth bottles out back under green thing'. Another said 'don't tip meth out hide it'.

Before Jones's conviction was secured, an earlier trial, which was abandoned, was opened by prosecutor Jeremy Grout Smith.

He told Preston Crown Court: 'Sophie died because she was exposed to the drugs as a result of the carelessness and negligence of her parents. 

'Both defendants take drugs every day smoking heroin and crack cocaine. The methadone was in a child's drinking cup - a Tom and Jerry drinking cup.

Storage: The drug-addict couple kept heroin substitute methadone in the Tommy and Jerry beaker, pictured

In the run-up to the tragedy, a neighbour said he had often heard arguing between the adults and Sophie, pictured, would cry for a very long time without being attended to

'Michelle King as a registered user of heroin was prescribed methadone as part of a drug treatment programme. 

'Her prescription was for two 60ml bottles on a Monday and Wednesday and three on a Friday. 

'The 4th of March was a Tuesday, simple arithmetic tells you there ought not to have been 146 ml of methadone in the house or anything like it.'

'Michelle King's supply ought to have been low. But we have evidence that instead of taking it herself was keeping it and selling it to other drug users and using the money she made to buy heroin and cocaine for herself and Barry Jones.

'We say they showed complete disregard for the health of the child. 

'Prosecution point to the gross negligence of storing such a drug in a child's Tom and Jerry drink beaker - something that we submit Barry Jones must have known was going on and failing to keep it out of harms reach from a child only two years of age and failing to seek medical help for Sophie until it was too late.

A relative told the court that Sophie was unsteady on her feet before her death, and that they had heard King say that Sophie was acting weird and Barry telling his partner 'I hope you've not left the top off your tablets'

'Sophie, after a scientific analysis of her hair, was found to be exposed to methadone, heroin, cocaine and diazepam which she had in some way ingested over a period of several months.'

In the run-up to the tragedy, a neighbour said he had often heard arguing between the adults and Sophie would cry for a very long time without being attended to. 

King would keep the methadone upstairs and would bring it down in a bottle with a lid on so a user could drink it and then hand it back.

On March 4 King sent several text messages to one drug user reminding her that she owed her £25. She had also gone to buy crack cocaine before returning home. 

A relative saw Sophie fall on two occasions and noticed that she was unsteady on her feet.

King was heard to say that Sophie was acting weird - with Jones responding with: 'I hope you've not left the top off your tablets'.

Heroin addict, Michelle King, was selling her prescribed dosage of methadone to other addicts when her child died, the court heard

The couple were told to call an ambulance but they lied about taking Sophie to a walk in centre and instead suggested the child had drunk some cider.

Eventually at 11.40pm, Jones calmly called 999 saying his daughter had stopped breathing. 

An ambulance arrived three minutes after the call and found him in the lounge performing CPR on Sophie following directions being given over the phone. 

Vomit was visible in Sophie's hair, face, chest and on the floor and appeared to contain blood.

At the house Jones told police that his mother and her boyfriend had been at the house and had brought with them a bottle of cider. 

He told them that after he left he could smell cider on the sofa where Sophie was sleeping and noticed that her bottom half was wet before noticing she was not breathing.

Mr Grout-Smith said that this had been a lie and had been part of a 'joint cover up' between himself and King who had been holding back seeking medical attention in the hope Sophie would sleep off the effects of the methadone.

'It is the prosecution's case that the defendants knew that they were at fault and as the afternoon wore on Sophie failed to come round, they must have known,' he added.

'Prior to the 999 call made at 11:40 there had also been an attempt to clear the house of incriminating evidence. 

'The child's drinking cup with methadone and had been put under a sheet in the back yard of the house, bins with shoot bottles in have been moved outside from the back of the house to the end of the street away from their house. 

'The neighbour noticed that the water running the upstairs sink for significant period of time.

'The prosecution submit it must have been a joint attempt by both defendants to clear up the house.

'They were acting together to clear the house of any incriminating evidence they were both aware she had been put into a deep slumber had not woken up - they needed to protect themselves.

Police found a large number of Fruit Shoot bottles at the house - one of which had traces of methadone inside. There were also traces of cocaine and heroin found in the bins 

'It is significant there were no phone calls for a period of one hour between 10:45 and the 999 call at 11:40. In the context of the usual use of phone it was an unusual silent.'

When police searched the house they found hidden under a green cover in the back yard 146ml of methadone - approximately 1/4 of a pint and the Tom and Jerry beaker. 

Police found a large number of Fruit Shoot bottles at the house - one of which had traces of methadone inside. There were also traces of cocaine and heroin found in the bins.

Tests showed Sophie's cause of her death was inhalation of stomach contents and poisoning by methadone. 

When he was arrested and interviewed under caution Jones maintained Sophie may have drank cider and had become a little bit sleepy before falling asleep on his knee.

Both will be sentenced on December 1.
