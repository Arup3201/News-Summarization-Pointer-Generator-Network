Seth Meyers has been officially named
 the new late night host as Jimmy Fallon passes the torch to a fellow 
Saturday Night Live veteran.

Meyers, 39, who has been on the SNL cast since 2001, is moving from his 'Weekend Update' desk to his own late night show on NBC.

He replaces Fallon, who has hosted the 12:35am program since 2009.

Fallon will be moving up an hour as Jay Leno's replacement on the 'Tonight' show in 2014.

Meyers' show will originate from New York's Rockefeller Center, just like Fallon's 'Tonight' show.

While Fallon is set to take over for Leno following the 2014 Olympics, Meyers' premiere date has not yet been set.

Longtime 'Saturday Night Live' producer Lorne Michaels will be the executive in charge of both shows.

It was rumored that Meyers was Michaels' favorite for the job, with 30 Rock star Tina Fey a close second.

Meyers turned down an opportunity to take over some hosting duties last July when he was offered the opportunity to co-host 'Live with Kelly!' on ABC - replacing longtime personality Regis Philbin.

Tax credit: New York's proposed budget includes a tax credit that would benefit NBC for moving the 'Tonight Show' back to New York. The show's host, Jay Leno, (left) is pictured with Jimmy Fallon (right)

Boss: SNL chief Lorne Michaels, right, holds a lot of sway at NBC and was said to be most keen on Meyers to take over the time slot, although Tina Fey, left, was a close second

At the time, Meyers told the South Florida Sentinel that the time wasn't right and was 'really in love with 
the job I have' at SNL. The position eventually went to former football star Michael Strahan.

NBC is reportedly building a state-of-the-art studio for Fallon at 30 Rock.

In
 fact the state of New York's budget proposal even includes a tax credit
 for established TV shows that relocate to the state - seemingly geared 
specifically for 'The Tonight Show'.Â 

The
 tax credit, worth 30 per cent of production costs, is already available 
to shows that start filming their first season in the state.

The
 new provision, coming just in time for 'The Tonight Show's' reported 
relocation to New York, would make the credit available to programs that
 started filming elsewhere, as well.

History: 'The Tonight Show' has been filmed in Los Angeles since 1972. Before that, it was located in New York
