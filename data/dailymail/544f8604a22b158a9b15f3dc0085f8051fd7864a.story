Wearing bespoke tailored outfits with perfectly combed hair, these models would look suitably placed on the set of Downton Abbey.

Their immaculate period white-and black-tie attire and country-gent tweed jackets are akin to the wardrobes of the 1920s characters and to the tailleur worn by His Lordship's Hugh Bonneville in the hit ITV series.

But alas, they are not from the period drama, and rather their impeccable dress is the Edwardian-inspired Autumn/Winter collection by Savile Row tailors.

The models showcased the retro styles as part of London Menswear Fashion Week yesterday.

They were wearing the designs from Holland & Holland and Henry Poole outside Spencer House in 
London, for the Savile Row presentation.

The outfits were remarkably similar to those worn by the cast of Downton Abbey.

And a flat cap, tweed suit with a matching waistcoat and wellington boots appear to be all the rage since the drama soared in popularity.

Not to mention a long walking stick to finish off the country gentlemen look.

The classic designs are the latest sign of Downton's dress codes becoming something of a fashion phenomenon.

Sales of retro styles, including flapper dresses and demure ruffled blouses have been seen to be on the rise as the British public aspire to look like the flawless ladies of the manor Sybil, Mary and Edith Crawley.

All-smiles: The collection is full of tailoring traditions and subtle references to English style

And the traditional English evening wear
 donned by the anchor of the show Mr Bonneville also seems to have 
inspired the latest designs.

Mr Bonneville was fitted for white-and black-tie attire for the second series by the historic 
Savile Row tailor Huntsman (est 1849).

The bespoke white tie and tails created to fit him perfectly as the character of Robert, Earl of Grantham, was worn at every dinner scene in the second series,

His choice of outfit for a fitting at Huntsman marked his role as Robert, Earl of Grantham.

The models wear flat caps, tweed suits with waistcoats and one holds a walking stick resembling the style adopted by the 1920s characters in the period drama

The models for the Autumn Winter collection wear an array of outfits in different materials including tweed and velvet, along with a pin-stripped suit

Huntsman, founded in 1849 by Henry 
Huntsman, has archives going back to 1890 - which helps the designers fashion appropriate clothing for the actors.

Creative director Sarah Burton, who created the Duchess of Cambridge's 
wedding dress, told the Guardian: 'It feels right to focus on Savile Row for our 
first ever Alexander McQueen menswear show in London, especially since 
we opened our menswear store on Savile Row at the end of last year.'

She
 added: 'This collection is full of tailoring traditions and subtle 
references to English style.'
