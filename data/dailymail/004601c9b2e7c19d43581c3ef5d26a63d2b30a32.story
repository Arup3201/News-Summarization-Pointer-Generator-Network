An 11-year-old boy from New Jersey was shot dead on Saturday when his uncle, who was showing off a handgun, pointed its laser at the child's head.

Hunter Pedersen had been visiting his grandparents' house at a gated community in Delaware when he was shot above the eye by Chad Olm.

Olm, who lives in the basement of the grandparents' home, had been showing the schoolboy and his own son his collection of guns.

Tragic: Hunter Pedersen was shot in the head on Saturday evening as his uncle showed off his handguns

The 34-year-old, who has been charged with criminal homicide and endangering the welfare of a child, told police he didn't believe the gun was loaded.

He said that when the two boys asked to see the gun collection, he removed three weapons from a safe, including a Glock 27 .40 caliber handgun with a laser sight.

Olm told police he didn't keep his guns loaded, and said he didn't check to see if the handgun, which didn't have a magazine in it at the time, had any rounds of ammunition in it.

According to WNEP, he told police he pointed the laser on the walls and ceilings before pointing it at his nephew's forehead.

'Look, you have a red dot on your forehead,' Olm told police he remembered one of the boys saying.

He said when Hunter, who has two sisters, reached for the gun, he pulled the trigger and a single bullet hit the boy above the eye.

Hunter's father said that he doesn't believe Olm intended to hurt his son, but he is angry at his brother-in-law.

According to the Pocono Record,
 Hunter's body was found on the floor of his uncle's bedroom, and a 
single bullet hole could be seen in the corner of the room.

The gun had been laid on the washing machine in the laundry room after the shooting.

When
 police arrived, the child’s body was found on the floor of the bedroom 
and there was a single bullet hole in the corner of the room, near the 
ceiling.

Hunter's
 parents were not with him at the time of the shooting. They arrived at 
the grandparents' home shortly after police were called.

'It’s 
horribly tragic. The family is devastated,' police station commander 
Lieutenant Chris Paris said. 'The family has lost something that they 
can never replace.'

Hunter's friends and teachers at his Wallenpaupack district school are also mourning the loss of the popular student.

Flags
 outside the main school building were lowered to half-mast on Monday 
morning, and grief counselors traveled on the school bus the 11-year-old
 usually caught to school.

'It’s hard, we’re going to miss Hunter very much,' school principal Amanda Cykosky said.

Wallenpaupack
 area superintendent Michael Silsby added: 'Not only children are taking
 it very difficult, staff who worked with Hunter throughout the years. 
His teachers, counselors, people in the building.'

A fundraising page has been set up by friends of the family, to help them cover funeral expenses.

Hunter's father, Robert Pederson, was laid off at the start of April which has left the family without insurance to cover expenses.

Olm is being held in Pike County correctional facility, where he is facing charges of criminal homicide, recklessly endangering another person, and endangering the welfare of children.
