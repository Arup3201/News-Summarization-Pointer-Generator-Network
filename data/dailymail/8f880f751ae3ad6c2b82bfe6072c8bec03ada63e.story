Aston Villa decided to take the plunge by dispensing of the services of Paul Lambert in midweek after a poor run of results. 

Tim Sherwood, Jurgen Klinsmann and Glenn Hoddle are among the names said to be on Aston Villa's potential shortlist to take over the reins at Villa Park. Here, Phil Slater of 90min.com suggests who he would want to replace Lambert. 

So the inevitable has happened, Paul Lambert is gone and Villa are in the bottom three. For many of us, both of these scenarios were spotted a mile off, so why has it taken until now for the club to act?

Looking through the potential candidates to replace him does not make for pleasing reading. In fact, it probably demonstrates how far we've fallen since those heady days with Martin O'Neill in charge, when we entertained the nation with our flying wingers and a genuine intent to bash the door down on a slightly different looking top four.

The shortlist drawn up by many is a collection of the cringeworthy (Tim Sherwood, Glenn Hoddle), the unproven (Jurgen Klinsmann, Paul Clement) and the washed-up (Nigel Adkins, Gareth Southgate, Hoddle - again), while Michael Laudrup's departure from Swansea City last year left a skid-mark on a promising reputation on these shores.

Steve McClaren and Eddie Howe are working wonders at Derby County and Bournemouth respectively 

There are no stand-outs. In reality, the most attractive names are those currently contracted to Championship clubs: Eddie Howe, Steve McClaren and, to a lesser extent, Neil Lennon.

Had Lambert gone a few months back, during the first of two shamefully barren spells in front of goal, when we were merely on the cusp of our slide towards the bottom half of the table - nevermind the bottom three - maybe we could have thought more long-term about his replacement.

The likes of Howe and McClaren, who've implemented successful, attacking styles to enable swift, yet steady progression at their respective clubs (Bournemouth and Derby County), would have perhaps been ideal at the time.

Both are renowned for getting the best out of what they've got. Indeed, eight of the 14 Bournemouth players to feature against Derby on Tuesday played in the Cherries' 0-0 draw at Tranmere 22 months ago, which secured their promotion as League One runners-up. 

While McClaren has managed to coax a goal every 44 minutes out of our very own Darren Bent since January - albeit in the second tier.

Aston Villa have struggled since Martin O'Neill decided to resign from his role at the club in August 2010

The trouble is that neither are going to abandon their current projects to rescue Aston Villa from the clutches of the division they're both so close to escaping. It would be like leaving your high-paid job as Google director in favour of a similar role at Ask Jeeves, circa. 2002.

The sun probably set on our top-four hopes when we lost O'Neill and Mr. Lerner stopped dipping his hands in his pocket. Losing James Milner that same summer was also a sign of things to come in the transfer market, but as Everton proved last season, you don't always need vast coffers or big-name players to challenge at the right end of the table. Instead, a successful philosophy with a sprinkling of spirit.

I'd be surprised if Lambert's departure didn't coincide with Villa scoring goals again, such has been the boulder-like weight on the players' shoulders these last few months, but that said, this appointment has to be right for us going forward.

Howe and McClaren tick my boxes, but we may have to survive first.
