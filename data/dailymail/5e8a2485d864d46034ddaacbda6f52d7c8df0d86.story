An over-zealous traffic warden appeared to slap a 'parking ticket' on a wheelie bin after it was left blocking the road on double yellow lines.

The warden was slammed by shocked motorists who watched him attach the penalty charge envelope to the large Biffa waste bin.

The council employee's conducted is now being investigated by local authority in Carmarthen, West Wales. 

A wheelie bin in Carmarthen, West Wales, was given a £30 parking ticket after it was left blocking the road on double yellow lines

Salesman Mike Jones said: 'It was bizarre - I realised had just watched a warden give a ticket to a wheelie bin for bad parking.'

Mr Jones, 54, spotted the warden talking to other motorists about the wheelie bin from a town centre shop blocking the road.

 'It appeared the warden slapped the plastic ticket envelope on the bin in a moment of hi-jinx after a member of public pointed out it was parked on double yellow lines,' he said.

'I saw him doing it and pulled in and took the pictures. What's the point of putting it on the bin?

'How could it be enforced? After all a wheelie bin doesn't have a registration plate.

'I just thought it was a total waste of council resources and time.

'I'm sure he could have been doing something better.'

The local council said the Biffa bin, pictured above, was not actually issued with a parking ticket and that the officer had wrapped the envelope around the handle in a 'light-hearted' moment

The local authority has launched an investigation into the conduct of the enforcement officer after he appeared to give the bin, pictured above, a ticket

The traffic warden faced a booking of his own - when his bosses 'launched a formal investigation into the conduct of this officer'.

Carmarthenshire Council Traffic and safety manager John McEvoy said: 'The officer was patrolling the area when a member of the public pointed out that the wheelie bin was an obstruction, and asked if he was going to book it.

The bin was issued with the ticket in Mansel Street, Carmathen, West Wales

'The officer, in a light-hearted moment, wrapped a Penalty Charge Notice envelope around the bin handle.

'There was no ticket issued, it is not possible to book a wheelie bin or anything that is not motorised.

'Although this was meant as a humorous incident, we take this kind of thing very seriously and have launched a formal investigation into the conduct of this officer.'

A spokesman for waste collection company Biffa said 'It's a relief to learn that the bin in question isn't in trouble with the council.

'The ticket issued was simply a throw-away gesture and proved to be a load of rubbish. We are wheelie careful and do our best to make sure that our bins are in the correct locations at all times.'
