This amazing picture shows winter sweeping south in dramatic style as a huge dust cloud is blasted over Colorado.

The storm is part of a frigid wave of arctic air pushing south into the United States, coating parts of the Midwest with more than a foot of snow.

And along with dumps of snow - which will spread across the country later in the week - the influx of cold air sent temperatures tumbling as much as 50 degrees in hours.

Dust storm: This image, taken from the window of a passenger plane over Colorado, was caused by cold air pushing south thanks to an unusual weather system that sent temperatures plummeting

The dust storm, seen from the window of a passenger plane headed to Chicago from Los Angeles, was created when winds plunging south kicked up loose dirt particles and carried them along in their wake.

Passenger Amanda Wicks managed to get the aerial shot from the plane window, which shows the boundary between the new, cold front and the warmer air it is pushing out of the way.

The phenomenon, known as a haboob, was also caught in satellite images by the National Weather Service.

It is part of the 'Omega Block' weather system being caused by the remnants of a Typhoon sat in the Bering Sea.

Pushing south: The unseasonably cold air (blue and purple above) has been spreading south over the weekend, reaching as far as Texas, where temperatures tumbled some 50 degrees in a matter of hours

The system alters the path of the jet stream - fast-flowing winds which separate warm and cold air - bringing unusual temperatures across North America.

Cold air which usually sits around Canada and the north of the U.S. has been dragged as far south as Texas, while the warm air which usually sits around the middle of the United States has been sucked up towards Alaska, and is set to make the region unusually warm.

The boundaries of these temperature changes are accompanied by dramatic changes in climate, and spectacular weather formations such as the pictured dust storm.

Parts of Texas which were enjoying temperatures in the mid to high 70s over the weekend found themselves plunged into the teens in a matter of hours when the cold air rolled in.

By Thursday full effects of the displacement will have set in, meaning areas like Barrow, the northernmost point of Alaska, could have temperatures in the 50s. This outstrips estimates for Dallas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.

For now, the most visible effect of the weather system has been huge snowstorms pummeling the Midwest, where schools have closed and hundreds of accidents have been reported on roads around Wisconsin and Minnesota, where as much as 16.5 inches of snow have fallen.
