A Queensland father who was brutally bashed by four young adults after a night out at the pub has described his attackers as 'scum' and their punishment as 'a joke'.

Jason Wivell was leaving a nightclub in his local area of Rockhampton, about 600 kilometres north of Brisbane, when a female approached him and punched him repetitively until he was sprawled on the ground.

In the security footage of the incident, aired by A Current Affair on Tuesday evening, one of the women initiated the shocking assault before another female and two males joined in.

Shocking security footage showed Queensland father Jason Wivell being brutally attacked by four people outside a Rockhampton nightclub

The father of two told the program he believes his assailants got off easy and only two of them served time behind bars

Jason was repeatedly bashed while on the ground, forced to use his arms to cover his head. He was kicked and punched more than 30 times during the vicious assault, even after he had lost consciousness.

Surrounded by the gang, he was severely outnumbered and even when a fifth person appeared late in the footage, he did not assist the victim but rather watched on.

Security from a nearby nightclub were forced to intervene, and even as they attempted to help the man one of the attackers took a final swing at Jason with one more kick to the head.

'It's ridiculous, I was laying there passed out and they're still going for it,' he told the program. The father of two suffered a broken arm and head injuries as a result.

The violent assault saw him punch and kicked to the head and body while he lay helpless on the ground

Jason suffered head injuries and a broken arm from the bashing, which continued even after he was knocked unconscious

Detective Acting Inspector Paul Elliot from Queensland Police said the vicious attack was inexcusable.

'We say it all the time and it has been proven, one punch can kill.'

Jason said he believes his attackers did not receive harsh enough punishments, as the two women did not even serve time behind bars.

Jason revealed he is scarred from the violent bashing and now too frightened to walk the streets alone. 'Every now and again, you get little flashbacks of it,' he said.

The group argued that they followed the Queensland man out of the bar after he inappropriately touched one of the females while inside the club, a claim which Jason denied.

The assault continued until two members of security from a nearby nightclub intervened and contacted emergency services

The bashing was initiated by one female who claimed Jason had touched her inapptropriately

The four people were charged with assault occasioning bodily harm, and plead guilty.

The two male assailants both spent time in jail, Anthony Reabel was sentenced to 12 months and released on parole after three, while Ricky Zizza was supposed to serve nine months but is set to be released in the coming days.

Neither Tara Cable nor Natasha Hughes, one of whom initiated the brutal bashing, served any time and were both handed eight month sentences which were wholly suspended for two years.

All four of the attackers were banned from any licensed premises for a year, and despite three of them being ordered to pay Jason $7000 in compensation he has not recieved any money.
