Rutgers' professor James Livingston has been ordered to pay $112,000 towards his daughter's law school tuition despite the fact they no longer speak

A father has been ordered to pay half of his daughter's $225,000 law school tuition despite the fact she cut contact with him five years, it has been revealed.

Rutgers University history professor James C. Livingston was told to pay $112,500 so that his daughter, identified only as 'J', can attend Cornell Law School.

The law school tuition is only a few thousand dollars short of Mr Livingston's annual college salary of $123,500.

Mr Livingston divorced from his wife Patricia Rossi in 2009 after 26 years of marriage.

The couple, who used to live in Highland Park, New Jersey, agreed to split the cost if their daughter attended law school and maintained a C average grade.

Following the divorce, Mr Livingston claims that his daughter no longer wanted to speak to him.

The college professor told MailOnline today that it was not true that he had fallen out with his daughter as was initially reported and that she had cut contact with him in 2009.

In an email, Mr Livingston wrote: 'She stopped communicating with me in 2009, but I assumed that once the high feelings understandably caused by the divorce had subsided, we would reconstruct our relationship. 

'Our five-year estrangement is not a product of mutual agreement, in sum.  It still feels inexplicable.  It's her decision, not mine.'

Miss Livingston, 26, graduated from Rutgers University shortly before her parents divorce and did not enroll in law school until three years later.

Professor Livingston claimed in the lawsuit that his daughter had previously agreed to start law school within a year or two of undergrad but instead took time off and got a job.

Despite communications between the father and daughter having broken down, Professor Livingston said he would pay $7,500 a year for his daughter to attend Rutger's law and live at home.

She decided to go to the Ivy League school Cornell in Ithaca, New York.

A two-judge appellate panel told Mr Livingston last month that a lower court's decision would be upheld.

The judges voted in favor of the professor's daughter saying that the divorce papers did not allow the father to dictate what school she could go to.

Professor Livingston was ordered by an appellate court on Wednesday to pay half of his daughter's quarter of a million dollar tuition to Cornell Law School

Professor Livingston also argued that he was not obligated to pay if his daughter was estranged.

Ms Rossi's lawyer Daniel Brown told NJ.com: 'You could read the tea leaves. The 
parties negotiated the settlement as to what their respective 
obligations would be.

The parties can agree to support the child and 
that's exactly what occurred here.'

Mr Livingston's lawyer Edward Snyder was not available for comment when contacted by MailOnline today.

There was no indication that the college professor would appeal the verdict.
