Nasa’s Opportunity rover has provided the world with incredible insights into the mysterious red planet.

In its ten years on Mars, the rover has uncovered evidence of water, taken impressive selfies and been at the centre of an international probe into a ‘doughnut’ on the alien surface.

But now Nasa is pulling funding for the rover, according to newly released details of its 2015 budget.

Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission. 10 years later, and it is still active on the red planet

The $17.5 billion (£10.5 billion) budget, which still requires Congressional approval, will also put an end to the orbiting Mars Odyssey mission on September, 2016.

‘There are pressures all over the place,’ Nasa’s planetary science division director Jim Green said during an advisory council committee teleconference call on Wednesday.

Opportunity touched down on in January 2004, several weeks after its twin Spirit.

Both rovers outlasted their warranty by years, but Spirit stopped phoning home in 2010 after getting stuck in sand.

Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission.

Instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years. 

The rover is currently at 'Solander Point' at the rim of Endeavour Crater on Mars.

The rover hasn't moved in over a month as it waits for better weather on the red planet.

During its time on Mars, the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals.

Their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water.

Early discoveries by the two rovers pointed to a planet that was once tropical and moist. However, the signs of water suggested an acidic environment that would have been too harsh for microbes.

More recently, Opportunity uncovered geologic evidence of water at Endeavour Crater that's more suited for drinking — a boon for scientists searching for extra-terrestrial places where primitive life could have thrived.

Nasa’s Mars rover Curiosity received a better deal in the budget proposal receiving $59.4 million (£35.7 million) to support its operations next year, and a steady $58 million(£35 million) a year after that.

The 2015 budget also includes proposals for $92 million (£55.4 million) for work on a new, unnamed, Mars rover that is expected to launch in 2020.

The space agency currently spends about $13 million (£7.8 million) a year to support the Opportunity rover.

Nasa, however, could still choose to restore funding for Opportunity if Congress approves an President Obama’s for requested budget supplement.

The proposed 2015 federal budget  allocated $17.5 billion (£10.5 billion) to Nasa.

The space agency has set aside $15 million (£9 million) to plan a robotic mission to Jupiter’s moon, Europa.

Mars rover Curiosity will receive $59.4 million (£35.7 million) to support its operations next year, and a steady $58 million (£35 million) a year after that.

Nasa’s budget also includes funding for a commercial ventures to fly to the ISS.

The agency could have $1.1 billion (£600 million) next year to help at least two companies develop commercial space taxis that would do this. 

The new budget also includes $3.1 billion (£1.9 billion) for Nasa to operate the ISS.

It provides $2.8 billion (£1.7 billion) to continue development of the Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket and Orion capsule for future human missions to the moon, asteroids and Mars. 

Planning for the so-called Asteroid Redirect Mission gets a boost to $133 million (£80 million) in the 2015 budget proposal, up from $78 million (£47 million) in 2014.

The space agency has also set aside $15 million (£9 million) in its budget proposal to start planning some kind of mission to Europa.

As well as a mission to Europa, President Barack Obama's 2015 Nasa budget includes funding for commercial ventures to fly astronauts to the International Space Station.

The agency could have $1.1 billion (£600 million) next year to help at least two companies develop commercial space taxis to fly astronauts to and from the space station.

The research outpost, a project of 15 nations, flies about 260 miles (420 km) above Earth.

Since the space shuttles were retired in 2011, the U.S. is dependent on Russia to fly crews to the space station at a cost of more than $65 million (£40 million) a seat.

Planning for the so-called Asteroid Redirect Mission gets a boost to $133 million (£80 million) in the 2015 budget proposal, up from $78 million (£47 million) in 2014.

The proposed budget keeps the Hubble Space Telescope successor program - an infrared observatory known as the James Webb Space Telescope - on track for launch in 2018.

It also lets Nasa begin planning for a new telescope to probe the mysterious force known as ‘dark energy’ that is driving the universe apart at faster and faster rates.
