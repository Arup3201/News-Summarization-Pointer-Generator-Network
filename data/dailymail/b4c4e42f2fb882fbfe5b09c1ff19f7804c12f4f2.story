Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has revealed he aims to go all the way in his final FA Cup campaign.

Gerrard scored a brace as his side beat AFC Wimbledon 2-1 in their third round clash on Monday night; Adebayo Akinfenwa scored for the hosts.

Brendan Rodgers' team will host Bolton Wanderers in the fourth round, and although Gerrard is taking nothing for granted he is keen to get his hands on the trophy one last time.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has revealed he aims to go all the way in his final FA Cup campaign 

'I always enjoy the FA Cup,' he said on BBC One. 'I grew up loving the competition and as it's going to be my last time, I want to make the most of it and try and go all the way.

'If I weren't here playing for this team, I'd probably be in the stands watching it so I know what (the FA Cup) means to every single supporter, that's why I always try to give my best.

'We've got to take each game as it comes. I'm told we've got Bolton at home in the next round and that'll be another difficult test.

'I know Neil Lennon quite well and I know he'll set up his team to be very difficult to beat.

'We take each game as it comes but of course, (winning the cup is) what dreams are made of and hopefully that'll be the case.'

Rodgers, meanwhile, admitted his team had struggled with the more physical aspect to the game, but was pleased they had adapted and triumphed.

He said: 'The physicality always does (put you under pressure). You're never going to be overly comfortable.

'It was a very, very tough game and we have to congratulate them (AFC Wimbledon). That type of game was very difficult. We started well but then we lost out shape in the game. Second half we adapted and I thought we had a few more chances.

'But I've got to give a big testament to my players. We showed the character to come through.'
