These are the child prodigies who used up all the available words at a spelling bee, forcing organizers to stop the showdown until they could find more.

When Sophia Hoffman, 11, and Kush Sharma, 13, buzzed through the list of words over 47 rounds during Saturday's Jackson County Spelling Bee, organizers had to pull more from a dictionary.

But after blitzing the extra 20 words, organizers decided to postpone the competition until March 8 because people were too tired to continue.

'It was legendary,' said Mary Olive Thompson, spelling bee co-coordinator said.

Loss for words: Organizers looked through a dictionary for extra words so the bee could continue on Saturday

After 19 rounds in a Missouri county's
 annual spelling bee over the weekend, only two competitors out of the 25 remained - Hoffman, a fifth-grader at Highland Park Elementary School in the Kansas City suburb of Lee's Summit, and Kush Sharma.

Onlookers were stunned when the students effortlessly ran through a list of about 20 additional words bee officials picked out of their Merriam-Webster's 11th Edition during the lunch break, The Kansas City Star reported.

But bee officials decided not to pull more words from the dictionary because they worried one speller might get a tough word and the other a relatively easy one, which wouldn't be fair.

Plus, Thompson said, at 'about 2 o'clock, I think we were all really tired.'

Saturday's competition went 66 rounds, she said, while last year's bee ended after only 21.

'Scherzo', 'fantoccini' and 'intaglio' were among the words Kush correctly spelled in the late rounds, while Sophia nailed words such as 'schadenfreude', 'mahout' and 'barukhzy'.

Both of them missed what Kush said was the hardest word: a 'French word; I have no idea how to pronounce it. It was a long word.'

With the winner moving on to the national spelling bee in Washington, D.C., in May, both contestants were at the top of their game in the final rounds Saturday, Thompson said

'Sophia and Kush's eyes were just bright and glowing,' she said. 'It was almost magical.'

The contest will resume March 8 at an undetermined library site.
