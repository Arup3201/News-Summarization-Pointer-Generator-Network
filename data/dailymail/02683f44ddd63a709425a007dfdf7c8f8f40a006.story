A mother abandoned her eight-year-old son on a dark street corner with four dollars in his pocket, telling him 'you always wanted me to go away, I'll go away'.

Natasha Harrow, 35, dumped Elijah in Manhattan's busy Upper East Side just before 10pm with no intention of going back for him, according to court papers.

After wandering the streets for two hours, Elijah was eventually rescued by passers-by, who found him standing alone at the corner of First Ave. and 86th St.

Police were quickly alerted to the incident, which took place on July 22, but were unable to catch up with Harrow for a further two weeks, reported the New York Daily News.

The mother, who lives on E. 93rd St., is now being charged with abandonment but police and prosecutors remain confused as to why she ditched her child in the first place. 

When questioned by police this week, she admitted abandoning Elijah, but contested where she left him.

She stated in court papers: 'No, I left him at 96th St. and Second Ave.'

The papers go on to say that Harrow 'deserted' Elijah 'with intent to wholly abandon (him).'

Harrow, who has one prior arrest on her record, was arraigned on Wednesday and ordered to be held on $3,500 bail on Rikers Island.

Elijah is believed to have been dumped by his mother near the corner of First Ave. and 86th St. - almost a mile from their home on E. 93rd St

Elijah was found in front of the shuttered Gracie's Corner cafe, which is about two blocks from Gracie Mansion, police and court papers state.

The child is believed to be staying at his grandmother's in Brooklyn while she cares for him.

Geraldo Petrie, who manages a florist shop across the street, said: 'This shouldn't happen to any child, especially not in New York City.'

'It hurts our entire city to see a kid get lost or abandoned. At least they found him.'
