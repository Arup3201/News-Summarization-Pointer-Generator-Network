A stunning timelapse video has shown a very different sight of London should it have an entire blackout. 

In a metropolis like London, England, light pollution makes the night sky invisible. Only a few of the brightest stars and asterisms force their celestial light through the man made glow of the city. 

The night sky, one of the most beautiful of natural wonders is extinguished from view.

The Shard would represent a shadowy figure clashing against the night sky should London ever experience a blackout

How the 87-storey Shard looks now at night, in the London Bridge Quarter development, imposing on the London landscape

But imagine if all the lights at famous London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, the Shard and Canary Wharf were all turned off. 

'Blackout City', by UK-based photographer Nicholas Buer, is an experimental timelapse film that makes the invisible, visible. 

Tower Bridge with no traffic! This scene, with only space's natural light, makes this iconic London scene as if out of a fairy tale

The bright lights of London, from buildings and vehicles, make us forget how beautiful the night sky could be

The blackout video gives viewers a special look at what the London night sky would look like - and it is impressive

It attempts to show what the night sky would look like If there were ever to be a total blackout in London on a clear, moonless, summers night.

It gives a real appreciation of the night sky and the millions of stars that would illuminate above. 

Writing on his website, Mr Buer said: 'Photography is my humble way of attempting to capture the atmosphere, power and beauty of the places I visit. Always chasing the light into the night.'  

As day turns to night in London, electricity becomes relied upon to light up our capital city so it can be enjoyed by all

The night sky in London becomes almost invisible, as it is completely overshadowed by the bright lights helping the tourism industry

Even without a blackout of London, the UK's capital is a sight to behold with lights showing off an array of different buildings and landmarks
