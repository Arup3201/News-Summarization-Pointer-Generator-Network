[headerlinks]Deucy the kitten who was born with two faces has died at the age of just two days - but not before reaching Internet stardom in her brief life.

The rare Janus cat was born Tuesday in Amity, Oregon, with one body, two faces and an apparently healthy set of organs.

On Thursday, the feline's owner, Stephanie Durkee, told the local station KGW that Deucy died peacefully from health complications that morning.

Double-take: One-day-old Duecy was rejected by its mother so Stephanie Durkee is feeding her by hand

During its brief life, the tiny kitten with two noses, two faces and four eyes had become a media darling, with videos about Deucy going viral on YouTube

The birth of tiny Duecy made her owner do a double-take when she was delivered.

Shortly afterwards, the newborn was rejected by its mother so Ms Durkee was feeding her by hand.

The kitten was examined by a vet and everything appeared to be in good working order.

Ms Durkee said: 'The kids actually found 
them and came in and said, "mom there's a kitty with two heads," and I 
said, "I think you guys are just tired, you're crazy, that doesn't 
happen."' 

Durkee's veterinarian said that he was aware of only four 'Janus' cats who have reached adulthood, with the two-faced Massachusetts marvel named Frank and Louie being the oldest known feline living to the ripe-old age of 12. 

Two of Deucy's siblings from he same litter who were not afflicted with the 'Janus' condition have survived.

In February last year, a kitten born with two faces died after barely living to the age of just two days.

Nash
 Hand and Amelia Forsythe, of Port Charlotte, Florida, named him Harvey 
Dent after the character's Two-Face alter-ego in Batman.

But the little guy died from complications.

'Janus' cats suffer from a condition called diprosopus, which almost always turns out to be fatal. Most animals born with two faces have birth defects, including a cleft palate, that makes it difficult for them to nurse and often causes them to slowly starve or get milk in their lungs and die of pneumonia.
