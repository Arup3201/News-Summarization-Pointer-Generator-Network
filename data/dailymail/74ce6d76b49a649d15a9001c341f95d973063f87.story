The BBC’s new boss will try to show staff he is one of the troops when he starts work tomorrow, refusing his own office and chauffeur to take him to and from work and earning 40 per cent less than his predecessor.

George Entwistle is taking over as Director General from Mark Thompson, who enjoyed a plush office on the fifth floor of the Corporation’s White City building with panoramic views of London.

But  Mr Entwistle, 50, has asked to be based at a plastic-covered desk in an open-plan area at the BBC’s refurbished Broadcasting House.

‘The days of the oak-panelled office are over, even for the Director  General,’ said a BBC insider, adding: ‘There’s a TV nearby that will have rolling BBC news but that is about as glamorous as it gets for the DG.’ 

Also unlike Mr Thompson, Mr Entwistle will be travelling to work by Underground from his home in South London.

Many staff claimed Mr Thompson, who has taken a job as Chief Executive and President of the  New York Times Company, was out of touch – not least because of his £800,000 salary. 

Mr Entwistle will earn £450,000 a year – a 40 per cent cut on Mr Thompson’s pay.

He was previously head of BBC Vision, which is responsible for programming across the channels, and earned £285,000.

He is keeping his plans as Director General close to his chest – but his priority will be to improve the broadcaster’s output with fewer resources.

It is thought he will spend considerable time with production units to get to grips with what they have in the pipeline.

Industry figureheads have suggested Mr Entwistle has bold plans to rejuvenate BBC in-house production – echoing Trust chairman Lord  Patten’s ambition to improve output by between ten and 20 per cent. 

Mr Entwistle, the executive in charge of the Jubilee coverage, was in the spotlight earlier this year when he was unable to answer criticism from the media and public about the quality of broadcasting for the event – because he had gone on holiday.

A former colleague of Mr Entwistle said: ‘Many people felt that Mark Thompson was somewhat invisible because he was tucked away in his office. You didn’t really see him on a daily basis. 

‘George always said if he had the top job he’d never want to lose touch with the people making programmes.’

Last night the BBC said Mr Entwistle would have access to the old DG’s office at White City and a  driver if needed.

A spokesman added: ‘George is looking forward to getting out and seeing as many programme teams as possible.’
