A fourth American aid worker infected with Ebola walked into Emory University Hospital today after arriving on a medical plane. 

The patient, a doctor who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone, arrived at 10.20am by ambulance, with a police escort, at the Atlanta hospital to be housed in a special isolation unit. 

Wearing a bulky protective suit similar to those of Emory's first two arrivals, the patient walked from the ambulance to the hospital - though a different entrance was used this time around. Reporters and television cameras - but fewer curious onlookers - lined the street.

The patient's identity was not released, and the hospital released no additional details. 

A medical plane landed in metro Atlanta on Tuesday morning, with the patient headed to Emory University Hospital, where two others - Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol - had been successfully treated. 

The plane touched down around 9.20am at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, just northwest of Atlanta. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. James Wilson confirmed the arrival. 

The World Health Organization said a doctor who has been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the disease.

WHO said the doctor was in stable condition on Monday in Freetown and was being evacuated.

Last month, two U.S. aid workers who contracted Ebola in Liberia, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, were treated successfully at Emory.

Another worker, Dr. Rick Sacra, 51, is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. In Omaha, Sacra's family members said he was able to eat breakfast Monday for the first time since arriving Friday at the Nebraska hospital.

The doctor from Worcester, Massachusetts, remains in stable condition. His wife, Debbie, said that Sacra is more alert and that they had a half-hour conversation by video conference Sunday.

'He hasn't been able to eat much since he got here, but he had some toast and applesauce,' Debbie Sacra said.

'He also tolerated the research drug well - better than he had the previous doses he was given.'

Sacra is being treated with an experimental drug that is different than Zmapp, the one given to Brantly and Writebol. 

Sacra's doctors have refused to name the drug they are using, but they say they've been consulting with experts on Ebola on his treatment. Zmapp also is experimental, and doctors and experts have said it's impossible to know whether the drug helped their recovery.

Sacra went to Omaha instead of Atlanta because federal officials asked the medical center to treat him in order to prepare other isolation units to take more Ebola patients if needed.

The Ebola outbreak sweeping West Africa has killed more than 2,000 people and has taken a particularly high toll on health care workers.
