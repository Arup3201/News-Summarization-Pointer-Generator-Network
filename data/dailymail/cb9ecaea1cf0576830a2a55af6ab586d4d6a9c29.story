This is the chilling hand-drawn building plan of the RMS Titanic that was used to describe how the 'unsinkable' ship met its fate.

The design, prepared exclusively for the official British enquiry, features a number of illustrations showing why the luxury liner sank after striking an iceberg on April 14, 1912.

It is among hundreds of artifacts linked to the doomed ship to be sold at auction later this month.

'Unthinkable': This chilling hand-drawn building plan was used to describe how the 'unsinkable' RMS Titanic met its fate. It was prepared exclusively for the official British enquiry and is marked with a date of May 1, 1912

Tragedy: The design features a number of illustrations showing why the luxury liner (pictured) sank after striking an iceberg on April 14, 1912. It is among hundreds of artifacts to be sold at auction later this month

The
 original cross section and building plan, drawn to
 a scale of 1/32 inches to one foot, is rubber stamped by manufacturers 
Harland and Wolff, with a handwritten date of May 1, 1912.

It was used to demonstrate to 
the world what had happened just before midnight
 on April 14 when the largest passenger ship ever assembled struck
 an iceberg - sparking the biggest maritime disaster in peacetime.

Among its most remarkable features are a hand-drawn gash in the side of the ship 
at Boiler 6, where the iceberg hit, and extensions drawn over the 
watertight bulkheads that were not built high enough for such an 
occurrence.

It clearly shows why the 'unsinkable' ship succumbed to a direct 
hit that night in the ice fields of the North Atlantic, claiming the lives of more than 1,500 people.

Valuable: The Titanic-themed collection includes a sterling silver 'Loving Cup' presented to Captain Arthur Rostron (left) of the Carpathia, which helped pluck survivors from the ocean, by Margaret 'Molly' Brown (right)

The cup: Brown, a wealthy socialite, became 
famous for surviving the disaster, and was known after her death as 'The
 Unsinkable Molly Brown,' celebrated in the 1960 Broadway musical of the
 same name

The location allowed water to enter the ship right at the point at which she could no longer stay afloat.

The plan is one of around 240 Titanic-themed objects to be put on sale by RR Auction in Boston, Massachusetts - which specialises in documents, manuscripts and historic artifacts - more than a century after the doomed liner sank.

The collection includes a sterling silver 'Loving Cup' presented to Captain Arthur Rostron of the Carpathia by Titanic survivor Margaret 'Molly' Brown.

A dedication engraved on the front 
reads: 'In grateful recognition and appreciation of his heroic and 
efficient service in the rescue of the survivors of the Titanic on April
 15th 1912, and of the generous and sympathetic treatment he accorded us
 on his ship. From the Survivors of the Titanic.'

Tragic note: Another item to be sold at auction is what is thought to be the last postcard Titanic hero Jack Phillips ever wrote before he set sail on the doomed voyage, never to return. Above, the tragic postcard

The cup has the highest starting price - and is expected to fetch more than $200,000 (£120,500) at auction.

Brown, a wealthy American socialite, boarded the Titanic as a first class passenger 
at Cherbourg, France, the vessel's first stop after leaving Southampton.

Five
 days later, when the mammoth ship struck the iceberg, she unselfishly 
leapt into action and loaded others into the lifeboats, willing to face 
the chilling danger of the deep to save as many people as possible. 

She was eventually put into lifeboat six, where she helped to keep spirits up as they awaited an unknown fate.

Hero: The postcard is a note of affection from Phillips (above) to his sister, letting her know he is safe and well

She later became famous for surviving the disaster, and was known after her death as 'The Unsinkable Molly Brown,' celebrated in the 1960 Broadway musical of the same name.

Bobby Livingston, vice president at RR Auction, said: 'The Loving Cup is one of the most valuable pieces of Titanic memorabilia in private possession today.'

The
 official enquiry by the British Wreck Commissioner into the sinking of 
the Titanic was convened in London on May 2, 1912, and presided over by 
High Court Judge Lord Mersey.

Spanning
 over two months, Lord Mersey, lawyers, experts in shipbuilding and 
marine law questioned and listened to testimony from over 100 witnesses.

Survivor: Second Officer Charles Lightoller was the most senior officer to survive the disaster as the last person taken on board the Carpathia. His letter sent word that the ship's assistant surgeon was lost at sea

'Good bye, old man': A two page typed letter on 
'Titanic' letterhead, dated April 9, 1912. The ship's highest ranking 
surviving officer recounts his final words with Dr. Simpson and other 
officers: 'We merely exchanged the words "Goodbye, old man." This 
occurred shortly before the end

Concluding on July 3, 1912, the final report was issued on July 30, stating that the sinking was the result of the ship's collision with the iceberg - not due to any design flaws with the ship - and the collision had been brought about by excessive speed in icy waters.

The report stopped short of condemning White Star's Captain Smith for the accident.

Along with the American hearings, the British enquiry would result in several safety changes including 24 hour manned radios, distress rockets, ice patrols and sufficient lifeboats on board each ship.

The original building plan was discovered at the old Cunard Line office, which merged with White Star Line in 1934.

Gold: This 18k gold ring was recovered from the body of Titanic steward Thomas Hewitt, who was buried at sea

Originally sold in London in 1987, it then went on display at the Ulster Museum in Belfast.

It was then offered at auction, at which time it became a part of a distinguished private collection. It has since been on display at the Titanic Museum in Branson, Missouri.

Mr Livingston said: 'Items of this magnitude used in the official inquiry are virtually unobtainable, this being one of only two plans that have ever come to market.'

Another item to be sold at the auction is what is thought to be the last postcard Titanic hero Jack Phillips ever wrote before he set sail on the doomed voyage, never to return.

Written on board the 'Unsinkable Ship' as it waited in port, it is a note of affection from a brother to his sister, letting her know he is safe and well.

The card, which has a photograph of the Titanic on its front, reads: 'Thanks
 very much for your letter. Having glorious weather, went to Cowes 
yesterday. Will write later before we sail. Love all, Jack.'

Dated April 2 1912 Phillips, a maritime operator, added in the address panel, 'Miss Elsie Phillips, 11 Farncombe St., Godalming.'

Other objects to be put up for sale include survivors' belongings, a fragment from the Titanic's grand staircase, and copies of newspapers which published front page reports about the 
catastrophe, including the New York Times, The Illustrated London News 
and The New York Evening Post.

RR said it expects the auction to earn between $700,000 (£422,000) and $1million (£603,000).
