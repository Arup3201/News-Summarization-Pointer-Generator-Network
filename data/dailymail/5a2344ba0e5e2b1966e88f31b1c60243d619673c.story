Reflective? Scott Jarvis was fined £2,600 for a terrifying drunken police chase

A banking boss was fined just £2,640 after he risked the lives of his two young children in a high-speed police chase while three times over the drink-drive limit.

Scott Jarvis, head of HR and business banking at Barclays, escaped with the paltry fine – equivalent to about a week’s wages – because magistrates said his long hours meant he would struggle to do community service.

Isobel, six, and George, three, were in the back of their father’s BMW as, drunk on six cans of premium-strength lager, he swerved uncontrollably across the M1 late on a Saturday afternoon last month.

The 35-year-old high-flier, who earns a six-figure salary at the bank, admitted putting their lives at risk.

He was caught after police received a 999 call to report his erratic driving.

At first he refused to stop, careering away along the hard shoulder, but eventually he gave up. He parked his car at a dangerous angle on the side of the road, with its rear pointing out on to the motorway.

Jarvis has since been banned from seeing the children by his estranged wife, Lucy.Appearing in court this week he admitted a charge of driving with excess alcohol and had his licence taken away for two years.

He was fined £2,640 – just over a week’s worth of his salary – after magistrates ‘made an exception’. He is believed to earn £125,000 a year.

They were told he worked 70 hours a week and was often busy at weekends, so would  find it difficult to do community service, the usual sentence for such a crime.

Leicester magistrates’ court heard that Jarvis suffered from depression, and had been drinking ‘with intensity’ since he split from his wife of ten years last summer. 

On February 2, after drinking six cans of premium-strength lager at lunch, he drove his children from his home in St Albans, Hertfordshire, towards Birmingham, where he was due to meet friends before going on a trip to a theme park the following day. 

Scene: Jarvis' car was said to be swerving dangerously on the M1

The court heard how his BMW was spotted ‘swerving from the nearside to the offside’ of the northbound carriageway of the M1.

A concerned driver, who called 999, also reported the car ‘indicating left despite there being no turn-off’.

Police rushed to the scene and Jarvis eventually stopped. Officers immediately noticed his children were in the car and said he was ‘unsteady on his feet and his breath smelled of alcohol’. Tests showed he was more than three times the drink-drive limit, with 107mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath.

At Wednesday’s hearing Jarvis was dressed smartly in a pin-striped suit, white shirt and cufflinks.

High-flier: Jarvis escaped community service as it wouldn't 'fit in with his long working hours'

He rubbed his hands together nervously as he awaited the court’s decision. Magistrates heard how he had spiralled into depression and was taking medication following the breakdown of the ‘turbulent’ relationship with his estranged wife, with whom he used to share a £650,000 four-bedroom detached home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire.

He began to drink with ‘intensity rather than frequency’ but failed to acknowledge he had a drinking problem until his arrest last month, magistrates were told.

Jarvis accepted the consequences of his offence could have been far more serious and was ‘embarrassed and ashamed’, the court heard.

‘He is looking at what has happened in his life. This has been a real kick and he realises he needs to make changes,’ a representative from the probation service said.

Tom Petersen, defending, added: ‘All the events and the depression were triggered by the breakdown of a ten-year relationship.

‘[That combined with] a very busy working life has left us in the position where Mr Jarvis is here today. It is not something he takes other than very seriously. His employer is aware of what is going on. He is dealing with the problem.’

Magistrates heard Jarvis, who describes himself on Twitter as a ‘humanist, atheist’, had been caught driving without due care and attention and without insurance in March 1998, when he was a student.They decided to fine the wealthy businessman after being told he worked more than 70 hours a week and was often busy at weekends.

A larger fine of £3,650 was reduced by a third because of his early guilty plea. The final figure of £2,640 included £85 in court costs and a £120 victim’s surcharge.

Chair of the bench David Simpson told Jarvis: ‘We are minded to make an exception in this case and give you a fine instead of a community order, which would be the norm.

‘I hope you are able to continue with the work that you are doing with regard to your alcohol issue and wish you the best for the future.’

Jarvis declined to comment after the hearing.
