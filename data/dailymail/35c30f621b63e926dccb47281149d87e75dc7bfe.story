It will take more than a broken toe to hamper Prince Harry's partying schedule and on Tuesday night the young royal was back on the town after sustaining some minor injuries.

The Prince was reported to have hurt his neck and broken a toe late last week and while Kensington Palace remained coy about the reasons behind the accident they did confirm that the 29-year-old remains committed to the South Pole charity trek that he has been training for.

Sporty Harry is set to undertake the 208-mile Walking With The Wounded challenge next month.

Following
 last week's mishap there was speculation that he may pull out but aides
 insist that the expedition 'is very much still on.'

Prince Harry has been pictured for the first time since he broke his toe. He was LouLou's Private Members Club in Mayfair watching a special performance by Buena Vista Social Club

A spokesman for the Prince confirmed that the 29-year-old 
injured himself ‘a few days ago’, but declined to go into further 
detail, saying: ‘He broke his toe privately. That’s all we will say.’

X-rays
 will have determined the level of injury but there is usually very 
little that can be done to mend a broken toe apart from rest. 

On Tuesday night though Harry appeared to be bored of resting and put any pain behind him as he visited a London nightclub with friends.

The smartly dressed Prince spent the evening at Mayfair members club LouLou's, watching a special performance by Cuban group the Buena Vista Social Club.

Wearing a smart navy blazer, bright blue trousers and sharp white shirt the redhead seemed less boisterous than usual as he left the venue at 3am, and he sported a pair of soft suede shoes which might have been a concession to his recent injury.

The
 Walking With The Wounded challenge hopes to raise £2million for injured
 servicemen. Harry will be joining a team of servicemen and women all of
 whom lost limbs while fighting in Afghanistan.

An aide said: ‘Prince Harry will be taking part. The trek is very much on. He’s been seen around and appears to be walking ok.’

A
 source added: ‘Look at his teammates. They are men and women who have 
had arms and legs amputated in the service of their country. This is not
 a big issue for him.’

Prince Harry’s girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, appeared to have been elsewhere on his big night out, although reports that the blonde recently enjoyed a weekend shoot at the Queen’s Sandringham estate are considered a sign of their deepening romance.

The 29-year-old royal was given the run of the monarch’s private home in Norfolk two weekends ago and invited up a group of friends, including the blonde dancer who has captured his heart.

Sources have told Mail Online that fourth-in-line-to-the throne Harry is ‘incredibly serious’ about 24-year-old Cressida.

In recent weeks the pair have been seen out on the town together, enjoying several dates including a visit to see The Book Of Mormon and a James Blunt gig.
