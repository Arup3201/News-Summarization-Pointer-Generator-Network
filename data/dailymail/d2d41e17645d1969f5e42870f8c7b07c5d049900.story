A baffled Tesco customer claims she couldn’t believe her eyes when she saw a bottle of water on sale at 25p each - or two for 70p.

The bizarre pricing from the Every Little Helps store didn’t impress mother of-one Leanne Sellers when she saw it last week.

Ms Sellers had been shopping at the Tesco, in Bridlington, East Yorkshire when she saw the price tag.

'Offer': Leanne Sellers saw this offer at her local Tesco in Bridlington, East Yorkshire selling a bottle of water for 25p or two for 70p and did a double take

The ‘offer’ on Harrogate Spa Spring Water read ‘25p’ and then ‘2 for 70p’.

Ms Sellers, 44, who works at hairdressers ‘Curl Up and Dye’ in the town, said she did a double-take when she saw the dodgy seeming maths.

She said: 'At first I thought it was me being stupid but then I looked again and sure enough it was right there, it was like that for other bottles as well.

'I told another customer and he couldn’t believe it either. In Yorkshire we’re known for being a bit frugal, and this certainly isn’t a bargain.

'I told the girl at the check out and she said it was a bit stupid, but it was still there the next day so they can’t have been that bothered about it.'

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We change millions of price labels in store each week and sometimes pricing on promotions and multi-buys can get out of line.

'We make no excuses for this and sincerely apologise to any customer who has been inconvenienced.

'We have taken action to correct this example where bottles of water are selling at half price in selected stores to clear stock.

'Customers will always pay the lower price at the till on such occasions.'
