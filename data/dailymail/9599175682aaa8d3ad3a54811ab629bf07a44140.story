Kanye West has defended himself against critics who labeled his first collection for Adidas Originals a 'disaster'.

After Fern Mallis, the creator of New York Fashion Week, told The New York Post that she's 'kind of over Kanye' and is 'not a fan of his music, and the attitude and the agenda are not [her] style,' the 37-year-old took to Twitter last night to voice his own opinion in a rant that was later taken down, but has since been put back up.

'To Fern Mallis, I just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult,' he wrote in the first of a series of tweets. 'And I have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way.'

After Fern Mallis, the creator of New York Fashion Week, told The New York Post that she's 'kind of over Kanye,' the 37-year-old rapper took to Twitter last night to voice his own opinion

The Twitter rant seems to be an attempt at defending himself against critics who labeled his first collection for Adidas Originals a 'disaster'

'I have millions of ideas and I represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world,' he continued.

'I don't call myself a designer as I was not allowed to go to Saint Martins. Because I was too famous by the time I realized I wanted to design. 

'Fame is often looked down upon in the design world, so it's actually been something I had to overcome. All we have are our dreams, and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want, but we won't stop fighting. 

'We want to innovate and we will win someday.'  

The tweets were also directed at other fashion critics, like publicist Kelly Cutrone, who is known by many for her appearance on Lauren Conrad's LA-based reality series, The Hills.

'I’m not into his fashion thing,' she told People magazine. 'I think he’s fine as a rapper. I think he’s a joke as a fashion designer.

'I just think that you should stay focused at what you’re good at. Just because you’re a good rapper doesn’t mean you’re going to be a good fashion designer.' 

Kanye's questionable fashion fail has already started to spawn its own collection of entertaining memes, including this one which features designer Ralph Lauren

Kelly was also quick to point out that this is not the first time Kanye's attempts to establish himself as a legitimate designer have failed. 

'I mean, it’s not, he’s not legit. Have you seen the product?' she said. 'Didn't he have his own line in London, which was a disaster that he spent $10 million to do, that no one wore?' 

Plenty of would-be fashion critics on Twitter also shared Kelly's somewhat blunt opinion of Kanye's Adidas collection, which featured a series of skin-tight nude body stockings which were paired with flesh-colored crop tops.

'I'm no fashion guru but I feel like Kanye is the 2015 version of "The Emperor's new clothes."' one Twitter user wrote, while another added: 'I can't believe people are actually buying ripped clothing just bc [sic] Kanye designed them. Bruh give me your clothes & I'll rip them for free.'

Despite claiming to be incredibly excited at the prospect of showing his Adidas Originals collection, Kanye failed to raise a smile when he took to the catwalk

The collection included a number of unflattering ensembles, which featured skin-tight body stockings and barely-there crop tops

Kanye's show was attended by a whole host of his celebrity friends, including his wife Kim Kardashian (L), who wore one of his designs, and Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour

It should have been all about the models on the catwalk but naturally Kanye West ensured his wife (and muse) Kim Kardashian was the best dressed at his Adidas fashion show yesterday.

We're not used to seeing Miss Kimmy K. in anything but form fitting designer duds, but we're really loving this loose look on her. That Yeezy camo oversized jacket is everything! Unfortunately it's not available to buy just yet though.

The reality star has definitely been bringing back this 1990's trend as of late - she was spotted in a pair of Faith Connection camouflage pants just the other day. Take a page from Kim's style files to nab her look with one of the picks from our edit below.

Both Saint Laurent and Rag & Bone make high end versions of the trend or opt for a real deal with a Rothko jacket on sale for only $73.95! Our favorite item here at Fashion Finder HQ is a Levi's mixed media camo bomber, which at $140.00 is also a style steal.

Kanye's questionable fashion fail has also started to spawn its own collection of ironic memes on social media, with one image of him and designer Ralph Lauren, which was taken at the Ralph Lauren show on Thursday morning, proving particularly popular. 

The picture, which shows Ralph showing  affection towards Kanye, alongside the words 'Nice try kid but leave the fashion to me', has already been shared hundreds of times on Twitter, with fans labeling it as 'brilliant' and 'hysterical'.

Thankfully, it seems that Kanye will always find a fan in his wife, Kim Kardashian, who actually wore one of her husband's skin-tight ensembles to attend his show.

Alongside an image of herself wearing the spandex design, she wrote on her Instagram account: 'So proud of my baby!!!! This moment is here!!! He has worked so hard on this collection!!!'
