Stella McCartney has designed two headscarves to be given out free to cancer patients at King's College Hospital, London.

The stunning headscarves will also be sold online from Harper’s Bazaar to raise money for the King’s College Hospital Charity, ring-fenced for cancer patients.

The acclaimed designer lost her own mother Linda to breast cancer at the age of just 56, so the cause is one close to her heart.

'The idea of losing your confidence when going through such an incredibly immense moment in your life if just not acceptable,' Stella says of the collaboration.

'Fashion, the way you dress and the things that make you happy become more important, not less so.

'For me, feeling good about the way you look is key. It is empowering and it helps you fight.'

'When you're ill, your confidence is very low, and you hold yourself differently,' McCartney tells Harper's Bazaar.

'I think that, when facing the big things, it is important that we remember that the little things are important too.'

There are three scarves and a pocket square for sale in the collection. Menswear label Rake have pitched in with two paisley designs for the project, funded by Coutts Bank.

'When
 I was a buyer at Browns in the Eighties, I remember buying a lot of 
paisley, way before anyone else, and it had this amazing reaction and 
selling power - I think men feel at home in it, too,' says creative director of the firm, Clive Darby, who lost both of his parents to cancer.

Choices are limited when it comes to headwear, for patients who lose their hair, although the NHS does provide wigs.

'Scarves are really important accessories, whether they are a necessity or not; they inject a very easy piece of style into your life. And so the design for these scarves is bold and timeless: there is a balance that I think is really important.

'The ill who wear them won't worry that they are making too much of a statement, but at the same time, the designs are exciting enough to make them feel proud of what they are going through and of the courage that it takes to confront the disease.'

A headscarf will be given to each patient treated on the chemotherapy ward at King's College Hospital over the next year.

You can buy the limited-edition scarves, starting at £145, here.

Proceeds go to King's College Hospital Charity and are ring-fenced for cancer patients.
