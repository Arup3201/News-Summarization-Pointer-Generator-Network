Flat pack furniture - three words that drum fear into the hearts of any women and men across the world who have ever walked the aisles of Ikea.

But brace yourselves, because we could soon be buying flat-pack clothing from the Swedish furniture giant too. 

Fortune 500 business consultant Stefan Engeseth has predicted a new way of clothes shopping that works perfectly with Ikea's business model, where customers buy ready-to-assemble furniture.

Swedish business consultant Stefan Engeseth predicts ready-to-assemble clothing is the future. He thinks Ikea has the perfect business structure to kick-start the trend

He believes that the company could sell both fully-made items of hard-wearing clothing and separate parts that people could take home and make themselves. 

The idea would mean that people could create clothing tailored to individual tastes by piecing together separate parts, with only basic sewing needed - the same level of skills necessary to build a bedside cabinet.

On a grand scale, this would allow customers to choose from a wide range of style changes, including colour, button shape, sleeve length, pocket shape and trouser length and shape.  

Stefan told Lucire magazine in New Zealand: ‘Emotionally, this connects people to how life was in the beginning - customers can personalise and “hack” the designs.’

Customers would be able to choose from different colours, buttons and sleeve length and take the separate pieces home to construct

He believes the new way of buying clothing could be such a huge success that it might even be applied to shopping for wedding dresses - a notoriously difficult procedure because of the detailed wishes that brides have.

He also thinks that Ikea could become a go-to place for hard-wearing garments, similar to the reputation it has built around furniture.

He said: 'We’re already seeing some shoppers go to outdoor and living stores to buy longer-lasting clothing.'

Customer would need only basic sewing to make the garments - the same level of skills necessary to build a bedside cabinet 

He continued: 'Ikea already sells reusable Kr 4 bags that are good and cheap; their clothes could be equally practical, as strong as work clothes.' 

Ikea has said that it has no current plans to start a clothing line, but if they did decide to, they would be wise into account Stefan's ideas for the project.

He has even come up with an extensive loyalty scheme, which would include discounts for furniture customers who are wearing the company's clothing, to make people feel as though they are part of a worldwide community.
