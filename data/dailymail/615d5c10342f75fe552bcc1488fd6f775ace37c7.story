Dramatic cellphone footage captures the moment a three-year-old boy jumped from the second story of a burning building into the arms of his rescuer on Christmas Day.

The child jumped into the man's arms while his hysterical mother watched on in terror as the blaze tore through an apartment complex in Birmingham, Alabama.

Encouraging the boy named 'John' to take a leap of faith, bystanders are heard screaming out to to him to jump and manage to catch him while the fire burns around them all.

The three-alarm fire broke out at around 2am Christmas Day at Valley Brook apartments on Gallant Drive in the Center Point section of Birmingham. 

Kerry Jackson said he was awakened by his wife telling him that she could hear smoke detectors blaring. 

Jackson grabbed his camera and ran with his wife to help tenants trapped inside upstairs apartments, among them the 3-year-old boy.  

'I really didn't have an emotion running through me at the time. It was just like I need him, we need him to jump,' said Jackson, who recorded the successful rescue.

It was Jackson's cousin who caught the little boy and he told MyFoxPhilly that everyone did what they had to. 

'One of the children didn’t want to jump. We had to actually pressure him to jump,' Jackson recalled. 

'People's lives were in danger, people screaming. Everybody in community came together to help one another,' Jackson explained.

Jackson said that after the boy was rescued firefighters arrived and discovered another child was trapped.

That child was also rescued from a downstairs unit and Jackson said that the reason he filmed was because as a photographer it is his instinct.

"Every time you watch it, there he go he jumped, he jumped, he finally jumped. It's just that feeling it gives you just to relive that moment and say you saved someones life. It's just a really good feeling," said Jackson.

“Everybody in the community came together and helped,” Jackson said of the fire.

Two adults and four children were injured – including the little boy in the video, who remains in the intensive care unit.

The fire was caused by food left unattended on a stove, officials said to Fox.
