A wheelchair user diced with death when he hurled himself into the middle of a major road, causing traffic to swerve and brake around him.

He was filmed shooting on to New Bridge Street, one of the busiest routes through Newcastle city centre.

And despite being wheelchair-bound, he appeared to be powering himself with his legs.

He caused cars and vans to swerve out of the way after he rolled into the road

Northumbria University students John Hall, 22, and Adrian Cheeseman, 21, captured the startling video on a smart phone.

John said: 'I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.

'We were on our balcony and looked down to see a man in a wheelchair propelling  himself along with his legs.

'It’s not quite something you’d expect to see from a wheelchair user and my housemate said to quickly film it.

'He was definitely turning a few heads from pedestrians, as well as people in cars and vans.'

The wheelchair user ignored a pedestrian crossing only a few metres away

Pedestrians watched in horror as the man began veering around in the road in his chair

The man, who was wearing a grey top and jeans, caused a white van to cross on to the wrong side of the street when he swerved on to the busy road without stopping at about 3.15pm yesterday.

He then used his legs to wheel himself diagonally across the road - forcing cars to swerve and brake to avoid him.

He also ignored a pedestrian crossing only a few metres away.

John said: 'I don’t think motorists could quite believe what they were seeing.

'They probably thought their eyes were deceiving them.

'To be honest, my natural instinct was to laugh - it was like watching Harry  Hill’s ‘You’ve Been Framed’.'

The 30-second video ends with the man wheeling himself on to the pavement on the opposite side of the road - however, his bizarre antics didn’t stop there.

John said: 'I wish I’d kept recording as when he got further down the street he started acting strangely again.

'He was veering in and out of the traffic when it was moving - I’m surprised he didn’t cause an accident.'

Northumbria Police said they received no calls about the mystery man.
