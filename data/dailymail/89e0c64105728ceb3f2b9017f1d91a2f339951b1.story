Divers off the the coast of Costa Rica were recently approached by a massive manta ray, but what could have been a rattling encounter for the scuba divers suddenly became an humanitarian mission.

Amazingly, the massive winged fish--which was entangled in painful-looking fishing line--appeared to be pleading with the international dive team for help being set free.

The shocked divers obliged, cutting the thick cords from the ray, whose species can weigh as much as 5,000 pounds and have a wingspan of 18 feet.

Needed a favor: A team of scuba divers off the Costa Rican coast encountered this giant oceanic manta ray this month. But they didn't go looking for the massive fish, it came looking for them

Entangled: The massive fish, whose species can reach 5,000 pounds, was entangled in some thick fishing line and approached the divers as if ask for some help getting freed

Painful: The divers happily obliged and helped from the painfully entangled fish from the line

Once freed, the manta did a backflip of joy and the astounding encounter was all caught on video by one of the divers.

The men also kept a memento of the experience they had off the Bat Islands.

'We picked up the line. It's our trophy now! Brian, the diver who cut the line, gave a little piece for all divers there!

The giant oceanic manta ray is the largest species of ray and is a type of eagle ray.

Scientists believe the ray has the largest brain of all fish species.

However, they've yet to determine just how intelligent the majestic, winged fish actually is.

Like other massive ocean animals such as whale sharks and the largest of whales, mantas are filter feeders and eat only the ocean's tiniest organisms.

The giant oceanic manta is believed to be highly migratory, routinely crossing entire oceans.

Free! The ray did a backflip in celebration and to kick off that last bit of fishing line

Unforgettable: Free and clear from the cord, the manta went about its way a free fish and the astonished divers kept the line as a memento of the unforgettable day
