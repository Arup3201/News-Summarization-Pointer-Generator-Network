Jose Mourinho moved a stage closer to the first cup he won in English football, then scotched talk of winning four trophies.

Chelsea beat Derby 3-1 to progress to the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup but Mourinho wants to ban talk of collecting a silverware haul.

The Chelsea manager expressed frustration that medical staff carrying a stretcher did not reach Kurt Zouma quicker as he lay on the floor following a head collision with Petr Cech.

Jose Mourinho insists his Chelsea team cannot win a quadruple of trophies despite their latest victory

His opposite number Steve McClaren was incensed Jake Buxton was sent off in the 78th minute for a tug on Loic Remy, claiming his side were robbed of a chance to mount a late comeback with the score at 2-1.

Andre Schurrle scored the clinching goal eight minutes from the end, to add to Eden Hazard's opener and Filipe Luis's brilliant free-kick. Craig Bryson pulled a goal back for the hosts.

Mourinho, who won this competition in 2005, shut down talk of trophies, insisting Monday's match at Stoke was his only consideration. 'No,' he said when asked about a quadruple. 'We can win Monday. But it will be difficult. We don't chose competitions, the next match is the most important thing. We go like this.

'You spoke a few weeks about being unbeatable in the Premier League – we never did it. Now you speak about quadruple, we never did it. So we have feet on the ground.'

Zouma will be available for Monday despite his injury. 'He was just a bit dizzy,' said Mourinho. '(Stretcher-carriers) came walking. When a player is injured and the body language is that he has to go out I feel a bit frustrated.

'The people with the stretcher want to help and if they didn't run I have to believe that is the instruction they have.'

McClaren raged: 'The disappointing thing is that we were robbed of the last 15 minutes. It is a big decision, a poor decision. It was six and two-threes, typical tussle between centre-half and centre-forward.

'I'm so proud of the players, we grew into the game. We've restricted Chelsea to very few chances.'
