Tottenham's capitulations against the Barclays Premier League's best teams prompted Hugo Lloris to question the character of his team-mates, but he believes Mauricio Pochettino will help them kick the habit.

Liverpool, who visit White Hart Lane on Sunday, fired nine past Spurs goalkeeper Lloris in two games last season while champions Manchester City scored 11.

Those four hammerings – and a 4-0 defeat at Chelsea – helped get both Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood sacked, wrecked top four dreams and damaged the rebuilding process as the club tried to replace Gareth Bale with seven new players.

'It broke our confidence,' said Lloris. 'When you lost once it can happen but when you lost against top teams twice, three times, four times it means there was something wrong in our side.

'When you're a player you're just thinking about the next game and you don't know what will happen. The more you win the better you feel. If you get a bad result you need to respond quickly next game with a victory.

'I have played a lot of important games and I have the faculty to switch from game to game but, collectively it is never easy to bounce back. This is why it's important always to believe in yourself, your teammates, your team, your club and the manager's philosophy to always try to keep in a good level. This is why we are working to find the best solution but always to improve as a team.'

Lloris reached the point when he felt the urge to speak out. 'We have to show more character,' he said, in April. 'We sometimes had the feeling that we gave up.'

With Paris St Germain interested, the France goalkeeper seemed ready to force a move but spoke to Daniel Levy before the World Cup and was convinced instead to sign a new five-year contract at Spurs and has been impressed with the early signs of life under Pochettino.

He believes the Argentine is toughening Spurs up and demanding a greater commitment to his philosophy.

'It was not just a lack of character,' said Lloris. 'We are in the best league in the world and we have to play at a high level. For that we need to see all players involved, ready to play for the team and to think only about the team.

'We changed a lot of things. We have a new manager, with his own staff. We believe in his concept and his philosophy, and we are working every day to go in his way and to play as a team. We want to show everyone we have the potential to be a good team in the league.'

For Lloris personally, the Pochettino way means more touches as a sweeper-keeper and fewer long balls launched from the back but he added: 'The most important thing is that everyone in the changing room believes in this philosophy.

'We need to keep working, keep the same spirit as we showed in the last few games and to have confidence in the changing room. You need to win, win, win. This is what we expect for this season.'

Many of those signed last summer are more settled, which has helped Pochettino and, by a strange quirk, it is Liverpool who are working to help an array of summer signings gel after cashing in on Luis Suarez.

'When you have a lot of new players in the squad it is never easy for them to adapt,' said Lloris. 'You need time. England is maybe a bit different to other countries, with the characteristics of the Premier League and the intensity, the level of your opponents and it's always a tough game, so they need you to be fit, always.'
