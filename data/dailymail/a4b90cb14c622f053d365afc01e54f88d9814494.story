Big mistake: After spending eight years in prison for murder, Lana Canen, 53, has been released after a fingerprint used as crucial evidence against her was found incorrectly matching hers

An Indiana woman who spent eight years behind bars for the killing of a blind 94-year-old woman has been freed, after a fingerprint used in trial against her was found not to be hers, after all.

After eight years Lana Canen, 53, was released on Friday from the Elkhart County Jail after a judge overturned her 2005 murder conviction in the 2002 Thanksgiving Day slaying of Helen Sailor and ordered her free.

Receiving that 'unbelievable' phone call bearing the news, was Ms Canen's mother.

'She said, " I got really good news for you,"' Sandra Brinson recalled of her daughter's attorney to WSBT-TV. '"All of the charges have been dropped.'"

Now standing in her home, though still in her prison clothes, Ms Canen said: 'I didn't never think this day was going to come. It's been a long time coming.â€™

Ms Canen, now a free woman, has long maintained that she had nothing to do with the murder of Ms Sailor in 2002.

At her trial, prosecutors said she conspired with her co-defendant, Andrew Royer, to rob Ms Sailor, and that Royer strangled the woman.

Both were convicted and given 55-year prison sentences.

Ms Canen appealed her conviction and earlier this year, an Arizona fingerprint expert discovered that an Elkhart County sheriff's detective, Dennis Chapman, had misidentified a fingerprint found on a pill bottle in Ms Sailor's apartment as Ms Canen's.

Waiting for the day: It was a single fingerprint prosecutors claimed to link Ms Canen to the 2002 slaying of Helen Sailor which she has maintained her innocence in

Prosecutor Curtis Hill said the fingerprint was a central part of the case against Ms Canen and that without it, he couldn't prove she was involved.

'There's just not an ability for me in good conscience to go forward and suggest that we have a sufficient amount to support a prosecution,' Mr Hill said.

He said the only way Ms Canen could be charged in Ms Sailor's death again is if investigators find other evidence against her.

When asked whether he thought Ms Canen was innocent, the prosecutor responded: 'That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I can't prove it.'

After her release on Friday Ms Canen said that since her 2004 arrest, she hadn't seen her now 10-year-old grandson, her daughter and other relatives.

Now free, she said even car exhaust smelled 'good.'

Speaking with WSBT-TV she said she had nothing to do with Ms Sailor's killing.

'That's what's hard to think (is) that people would think I'm that kind of a monster that would do that to a 94-year-old blind woman,' Ms Canen said.

Mr Chapman, who admitted that his fingerprint test results were wrong, was disciplined and still works at the sheriff's department.
