Extremely pleased: Professor John Walker-Smith, pictured here in 2007, won his appeal against the GMC

A doctor struck off over the MMR jab controversy yesterday won a High Court battle to clear his name.

Professor John Walker-Smith had been found guilty of professional misconduct following claims he took part in unapproved research  that suggested links between the vaccine, bowel disease  and autism.

However, a judge overturned the General Medical Council’s ruling and criticised its disciplinary panel’s ‘inadequate and superficial reasoning’ – but also stressed there was ‘no respectable body of opinion’ supporting the supposed risks of the jab.

Professor Walker-Smith lost his licence to practise in May 2010 along with Dr Andrew Wakefield, who led the research.

A GMC ‘fitness to practise’ panel found both men guilty of misconduct over the way the work was conducted after 217 days of deliberation – the longest disciplinary case in the body’s 150- year history.

Professor Walker-Smith, 75, always denied allegations that he had participated in the research under the guise of carrying out clinical investigations and treatment of young patients, including colonoscopies, at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. The retired doctor said the work was necessary for the purposes of diagnosis and treatment, and was not done to aid the research.

Mr Justice Mitting criticised the disciplinary panel’s ‘inadequate and superficial reasoning’ and ‘wrong conclusions’ before ruling:  ‘The panel’s determination cannot stand. I therefore quash it.’

He called for such cases to be overseen by someone with ‘judicial experience’ in future.

The MMR vaccination programme suffered a blow when Dr Andrew Wakefield suggested a link between the jab, bowel disease and autism in the late 1990s

As he left court with relatives, Professor Walker-Smith said: ‘I am extremely pleased with the outcome of my appeal. There has been a great burden on me and my family since the allegations were first made in 2004 and throughout the hearing that ran from 2007 to 2010. I am relieved that this matter is now over.’

Mr Justice Mitting added that Dr Wakefield’s comments and subsequent publicity about possible links between autism and the MMR jab, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, ‘had a predictable adverse effect upon the take-up of the vaccine’ which was ‘of great concern to those responsible for public health’.

He stressed: ‘There is now no respectable body of opinion which supports [Dr Wakefield’s] hypothesis that MMR vaccine and autism [or] enterocolitis are causally linked.’ Dr Helen Bedford, a senior lecturer at the UCL Institute of Child Health, added: ‘There has never been any sound evidence of a link. Indeed, there is a strong body of research showing no link. However, many parents who were anxious about the safety of the MMR vaccine decided not to have their children immunised.

‘Fortunately, it is never too late to have the MMR vaccine and I would strongly recommend that young people who missed out when they were younger have two doses of the vaccine to protect them.’

The GMC’s chief executive, Niall Dickson, said ‘key changes’ to its disciplinary hearings were already being prepared.
