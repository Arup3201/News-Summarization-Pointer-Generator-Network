A Colorado mother has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 14-year-old boy in her home closet - the first of two young victims' claims against her.

Lynne Collette Freeman, 39, a mother of two and former parent volunteer at University Schools in Greeley, has pleaded guilty to one count of attempted sexual assault on a child following a plea deal.

Police say a 14-year-old first reported a series of sexual assaults by Freeman before a second 16-year-old boy came forward with similar allegations earlier this year.

Guilty! Lynne Freeman, 39, of Greeley, Colorado has pleaded guilty to sexually abusing one of two underage boys, one in her home closet and a second allegedly in the park and her basement

Freeman has two daughters who were aged seven and 13 at the time of her arrest in June.

Freeman's attorney says she initially denied the assaults to police, having previously told the 14-year-old that it would ruin his aspiring baseball career if he told anyone.

But when both boys called her to discuss what happened, police recorded the calls capturing what they described as a confession.

According to the affidavit, it was in April that the 14-year-old was pulled into the closet while watching a movie at Freemanâ€™s home with a friend.

After the other child was asked to take the dog outside by Freeman, she pulled the 14-year-old into an upstairs closet, according to the arrest report.

Freeman locked the door behind them, pulled off his pants, kissed him and performed oral sex on him, police said.

After the incident, the woman repeatedly told the boy to keep the sexual contact a secret.

The victim contacted police in June after confiding in his father about the assault.

The mother said she '100 percent trusted' the boy to keep the situation private because she would get in trouble.

In the additional charges, the 16-year-old boy said he had sex with Freeman twice - once at a park and another time in her basement.

He told police that Freeman's older daughter had walked in on her mother and boy during the act.

Freeman is currently out on a $50,000 bail with her sentencing to take place on January 31.
