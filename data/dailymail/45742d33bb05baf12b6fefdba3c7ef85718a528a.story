It was hoped that a new road unveiled in the Netherlands that could change the way we drive in the future.

Glow-in-the-dark paint was deployed on a 0.3-mile (500 metres) section of the N329 road near Oss, Netherlands but the ‘smart highway’ has experienced teething problems.

The markings have ‘faded out’ and have been found to be highly sensitive to large amounts of moisture – which could prove a frequent problem in rainy northern Europe.

Blurred lines: Dutch company Studio Roosegaarde unveiled its glow-in-the-dark technology two weeks ago (pictured) that could be used to light up roads in the future and create interactive 'Smart Highways,'  - but have admitted that the lines fade in the rain

The proof of concept for Studio 
Roosegaarde’s innovative ‘Smart Highway’ design project is intended to 
be an alternative to street lights in remote areas and lead to 
interactive and sustainable roads.

The technology was first unveiled in 2012 when it scooped ‘Best Future Concept’ at the Dutch Design Awards and has been dubbed a green solution to lighting our roads.

Using ‘photo-lumising’ powder, the paint absorbs sunlight in the day and releases it at night for up to 10 hours, providing drivers with clear markings on where to go – or that is the plan.

Engineers are working on honing the idea after reports from drivers that markings are not as clear as they should be.

The stretch of road near Oss is not glowing as brightly as was hoped as it has been found that moisture affects the glow-in-the-dark paint, pictured here glowing at optimum levels

Civil engineering firm Heijmans, which is in charge of the project, told BBC News that the markings are sensitive to rainfall and consequently are not giving out a consistent amount of light.

‘As expected the “real life” trial enables us to learn from the environment and users,’ the firm said in a statement.

‘We will use these insights to introduce an update to the Glowing Lines 2.0 version. In the meantime we have temporarily faded out the lining to prevent any confusing situations for road users.

‘As planned we are working on developing Glowing Lines version 2.0, which will be ready for this summer. It will then be introduced on a larger scale in the Netherlands and abroad.’

The technology is currently being tested on a 0.3-mile (500 metres) stretch of the N329 near Oss

The UK Highways Agency said it is watching the trial but that previous studies have shown that using glow-in-the-dark paint is unsuitable for the UK.

Roosegaarde Studio refuses to let the water issue dampen its hopes that ultimately the paint could be used to make interactive roads.

For example, weather symbols could be painted on the road that appear when the temperature reaches a certain level.

Despite teething problems, it is hoped that the powder technology within the paint could be used to make road markings that change according to the temperature, giving drivers live weather reports that could warn them of icy roads

Studio Roosegaarde's plans for interactive roads also include lanes where electric cars could be charged

There are also plans for other functionality including priority lanes that indicate when and where cars should change lanes. 

‘Innovative designs such as the Glow-in-the-Dark Road, Dynamic Paint, Interactive Light, Induction Priority Lane and Wind Light will be realised within…five years,’ the companies recently said.

‘The goal is to make roads that are more sustainable and interactive by using interactive lights, smart energy and road signs that adapt to specific traffic situations.’

Dynamic lines could be used to tell you when you can overtake and when you should stay in lane
