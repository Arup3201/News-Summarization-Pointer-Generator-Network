Sony has unveiled a projector that can turn walls, tables and ceilings into giant TV screens.

The firm says the gadget, called a short throw projector, can turn an entire room into a screen, even creating virtual windows a view of the outside world.

Sony boss Kaz Harai revealed the project, called Life Space UX, at the CES conference in Las Vegas.

Sony has unveiled a projector that can turn walls, tables and ceilings into giant TV screens. The firm says the gadget, called a short throw projector, can turn an entire room into a screen, even creating virtual windows a view of the outside world

‘We are breaking free of the screen,’ he said.

‘You can create a window with a view of the outside, or turn movie scenes into wall art.’

The first projector, a large coffee table sized box which sits near a wall, will go on sale in the summer.

It can create a giant 147 inch image on a wall using 4K technology that creates images four times sharper than current HD.

The 4K Ultra Short Throw Projector will be available in the U.S. by summer of 2014 for approximately $30,000 to $40,000 (£18,000-£24,000), Sony said

MailOnline was given a demonstration of an advanced version of the system which also included a a ceiling projector and a wall of mirrors which turned into screens.

One demonstration took us under water, with astonishingly sharp video from inside an aquarium surrounding us, while another showed a live view from a Paris street, turning the wall into a giant window.

The effect is astonishing - although we suspect the cost of the system means most will only buy a front screen system. Images are incredibly sharp and clear, and trailers for action films like Elysium looked amazing, while the live feed from Paris is slightly disconcerting as it does almost feel like you’re there.

We also tried out a smart coffee table with a projector above it - at the click of a button, it turned into a giant screen which could also track our hands making it rather like a massive iPad.

‘With 4k image quality, it opens up countless possibilities,' said Karai.

‘You can see the worlds best surf spots, or see a private sky box view of a concert.’

‘We want to break free from screens and boxes, we even have a tabletop screen that can be controlled by your fingertips, turning your dining table into a giant touchscreen.’

The large box also contains speakers and storage space, and has been designed to look like a table when not in use.

‘Movies, video games, sports and photographs take on an air of realism, turning what was once a blank wall into a large as life 'entertainment window.', Sony said.

'The beauty of the new projector is that it requires no special tools or construction to install and operate. Simply set it right next to a wall that would not yield any shadows of people into a screen, and plug it in to enjoy immersive, large screen, 4K Ultra HD images.'

The 4K Ultra Short Throw Projector will be available in the U.S. by summer of 2014 for approximately $30,000 to $40,000 (£18,000-£24,000), Sony said.
