Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has condemned the media releasing details from the emails hacked from the accounts of Sony executives in an op-ed for The New York Times

Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has denied accusations that he is 'broke' and having an affair with an author whose book he is using as a source for his next screenplay.

The accusations were made by Sony co-chair Amy Pascal and came to light last week as part of a batch of hacked emails released by a group calling themselves the Guardians of Peace.

The author in question is Molly Bloom, the poker hostess who was arrested after hosting games with Hollywood A-listers such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Tobey Maguire.

The games, which initially took place in a back room at the infamous Viper Room bar on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, frequently saw huge amounts of money won and lost on games.

After an FBI sting put pay to her $4m-a-year job she revealed all the A-list names in her book Molly's Game - now being used by Sorkin for a screenplay.

Sorkin, the creator of The West Wing and The Newsroom used an op-ed for The New York Times on Monday to deny the relationship with the author is anything but professional.

He wrote: 'The widely published documents that were stolen include an email to Ms. Pascal in which I advocated going to Tom Cruise for the lead role (I did), a second email from one executive to another speculating that I’m broke (I’m fine) and a third that suggested that I might be romantically involved with a woman whose book I’m using as source material for a new script (I wish).

He added: 'I know there’s juicy stuff in the emails and I know some of us have been insulted and I know there’s more to come. No one’s private life can totally withstand public scrutiny. But this is much bigger than hurt feelings and banged-up egos.'

The op-ed piece went on to condemn the media for releasing the details hacked from the accounts of Sony executives and 'doing the bidding of the Guardians of Peace.'

He referred to it as 'morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable.' 

The hacked emails from senior executives at Sony Pictures have so far played havoc with its computer network, revealed confidential information regarding its staff and A-list actors, exposed explosive internal squabbles among senior executives and their emails revealing their true feelings about certain A-list actors.

Angelina Jolie has been described as a 'spoiled brat with minimal talent' while Leonardo DiCaprio has been called 'despicable', the emails have revealed.

The most damaging hack so far came in the form of email 'banter' between co-chair Amy Pascal and film producer Scott Rudin in which they speculated about the type of films liked by President Obama before reeling off a list of titles that had cast African-Americans and dealt with issues such as slavery.

Sorkin was accused of having a romantic relationship with high-level poker hostess Molly Bloom. Her book Molly's Game reveals she arranged games for a number of Hollywood's well-known names 

The email exchange took place before Ms. Pascal attended a breakfast for Mr. Obama that was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation.

She wrote: 'What should I ask the president at this stupid Jeffrey breakfast?” Ms. Pascal asked Mr. Rudin in an opening query. She then speculated that she might ask if Mr. Obama liked “Django Unchained,” about a former slave. 

Mr. Rudin countered with a suggestion about “12 Years a Slave,” while Ms. Pascal suggested other films involving African-Americans. 

Finally, Mr. Rudin wrote: “Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart.” The email referred to a broad comedy, from Universal Pictures, that starred Mr. Hart and Ice Cube. 

It is still unclear who the Guardians of Peace area and what their motive is for hacking Sony Pictures, although North Korea is widely believed to be the culprit and retaliating against Sony's upcoming film, The Interview, which involves a CIA plot to kill Kim Jong Un, the country's supreme leader.

Sorkin, who has also penned the script to the long-planned Steve Jobs biopic, insisted in his op-ed that Sony had not done anything illegal and did not deserve this kind of breach.

He wrote: 'I'm not crazy about Americans calling other Americans un-American, so let’s just say that every news outlet that did the bidding of the Guardians of Peace is morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable.' 

As the emails continued to be leaked, more information regarding a number of celebrities has eben uncovered.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, Beyonce Knowle's father Matthew emailed Sony executives in 2013 to suggest a biopic about Destiny's Child.

Representatives of Kanye West also contacted staff about a possible feature film about the rapper while the idea of a female Spiderman or an assistant was floated.
