Prison letters written by London gangster Reggie Kray and U.S. death-cult leader Charles Manson are to be sold at auction.

The 'murderbelia' has been put up for sale by a collector through McTear's auction house and offers a rare insight into the minds of two of the 20th century’s most infamous criminals.

The Kray brothers - Reggie and Ronnie - ran organised crime in the East End during the 1950s and 1960s but as nightclub owners they rubbed shoulders with the rich and famous including Judy Garland, Barbara Windsor and Frank Sinatra.

For sale: Reggie Kray's letter written while in Parkhurst prison in July 1998, left, and Charles Manson letter written while in prison for murder, right, will both be sold later this month by auction house McTear's

Reggie and his brother Ronnie were both jailed for life in 1969 for the murder of underworld figure Jack 'The Hat' McVitie.

Kray’s letters, written across 20 pages and dated over several days in mid-July 1998 while Reggie was incarcerated at Parkhurst Prison, are said to be coded instructions to outside associates.

In the letters, Kray wrote: 'Go to work for the fee. I’m so proud of all you’ve achieved.' It is signed off at the bottom with: 'Take care, God bless, affection, yours Reg.'

Kray also makes numerous references to 'Karl', said to be outside 'muscle for hire', who would do Kray’s bidding.

The letters state: '31st July at your place Karl will tell him to cook up. Talk later of him.'

Kray also refers to Karl as 'so cute' but, while he was believed to be bisexual, the context is unclear.

Kray’s twin brother Ronnie was openly bisexual and murdered a criminal associate for calling him a 'fat poof'.

Reggie died in 2000 after a short period of compassionate release from prison, five years after his brother died in a high-security psychiatric hospital.

Reggie Kray’s letters are expected to fetch hundreds of pounds at Glasgow’s McTear’s Auctioneers on Thursday.

A second lot contains a letter by Charles Manson, serving a life sentence in prison for his part in the murder of seven people and 'one unborn child' in California in 1969.

Amid the hippie culture of the 1960s, Manson, a charismatic ex-convict, put together a collection of runaways and outcasts known as the Manson Family.

Reggie Kray, aged 66, was granted day release from prison to attend the funeral of his father Charlie Kray at Chingford Mount Cemetery in London

In the summer of 1969 he became one of the 20th century's most infamous criminals when he directed his mostly young, female followers to murder seven people.

Among the victims was actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski, who was stabbed 16 times by members of the cult in the early morning hours of August 9, 1969.

Four other people also were stabbed or shot to death in Tate's home that night by the Manson followers, who scrawled the word 'Pig' in blood on the front door before leaving.

The following night, Manson's group stabbed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca to death, using their blood to write 'Rise,' 'Death to Pigs' and 'Helter Skelter' - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song - on the walls and refrigerator door.

Manson is serving a life sentence for those seven slayings and the murder of an acquaintance, Gary Hinman, who was stabbed to death in a separate murder in July 1969.

Manson originally was sentenced to death in 1971 but was spared execution after the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional. In 1977, his sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole.

His twelfth bid for freedom in April this year was denied by the parole board.

Manson' undated, four-page handwritten letter written in prison includes the quotes 'the pubic (sic) are bought and sold on jelly beans ... would get their babies, cut their tongues out and break their eardrums and create a chamber of nothing'.

He also describes religion as 'the biggest deceiver', adding: 'They come in all forms with words ... but what they are saying is that they need your soul'.

He also refers to his relationship with 'Manson Family' members.

Manson wrote: 'It can be used as the people in the so-called Family used me; by giving me their problems ... all I did was give them the answers.

'You see them singing my music and dancing my motions. That’s how I’ve survived all my life by staying on top of my end.'

Steven F Scouller, a collector and true-crime author who is putting the items up for sale, said: 'Murderabilia is the name given to items that were once owned or created by notorious criminals.

'I believe that letters by such people as Charles Manson and Reg Kray should be preserved so future generations can study them in a bid to help understand the terrible decisions these criminals made.'

Brian Clements, managing director at McTear’s, said: 'These are very unusual items that give an insight into the minds of two of the world’s most notorious criminals.

'It is rare to find detailed letters like these coming to auction and I expect there will be considerable interest in the sale.'
