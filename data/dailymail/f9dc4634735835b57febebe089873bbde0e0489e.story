Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander suggested legislation for HS2 might not be passed by 2015

The boss of Network Rail has been appointed to rescue the Government’s £50billion  HS2 project at an annual salary of £591,000.

Quango king Sir David Higgins  has held a number of lucrative taxpayer-funded roles.

He announced this month, earlier than expected, he was stepping down as chief executive of Network Rail.

The Government said he would be charged with cracking down on spiralling costs and delivering the scheme on time and on budget.

But critics questioned the decision to hire Sir David on such a large salary for a project where costs were already feared to be spiralling out of control – with some saying the appointment of a troubleshooter ‘smacked of desperation’.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘No amount of cherry-picked reports, deck shuffling, or taxpayer funded PR is going to make the case for HS2 add up.

'The case for HS2 has fallen apart so the scale of this massive pay award is particularly shocking.’

Sir David, 58, and the Network Rail board have been under fire for a high pay and bonus culture – despite poor performance and missed targets at a time of soaring fares and train overcrowding.

The Australian was also a chief executive of the UK Olympic Delivery Authority and the now defunct regeneration agency English Partnerships.

is taking over from Doug Oakervee – dubbed ‘Captain Invisible’ by 
critics for his lack of public profile –  who announced yesterday that 
he will be standing down.

Mr
Oakervee is currently earning up to £125,00 for a two-day week.

But Sir
David – who was handpicked for the job – will be earning pro rata up to
a third more than his predecessor.

Sir
David will join HS2 Ltd on a one-day-a-week basis on January 1, when he
will be entitled to receive pay of £950 a day on top of his existing 
Network Rail salary.

From 
March he will work full-time for six  months – on the equivalent of 
£591,000 a year – before taking a three-days-a-week role.

Transport 
Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said praised his ‘track record of 
delivery’.

Sir David said: ‘My first priority will be to rigorously scrutinise costs to ensure they remain under control.’

Former
Labour transport secretary Lord Adonis, who has urged his party not to 
get cold feet, tweeted: ‘Right man for UK’s biggest infra project.’
