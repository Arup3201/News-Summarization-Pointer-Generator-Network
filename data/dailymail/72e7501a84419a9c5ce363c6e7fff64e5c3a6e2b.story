Residents in the Japanese province of Fukushima have decided to tell the world that they are alive and well and living perfectly normal lives despite the recent nuclear disaster by recording a music video with Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy as the soundtrack.

Hitomi Kumasaka, a 53-year-old consulting firm manager in Fukushima, came up with the idea of creating a Fukushima version of the song after learning on the internet of a widespread misunderstanding that people can no longer live in the region due to the nuclear accident caused by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

About 200 people, including Fukushima Mayor Kaoru Kobayashi, small children, Buddhist monks, and people from all walks of life in the area appear in the video and dance in their own styles.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

Smiles better: The people of Fukushima have made a YouTube video in which they dance to Pharrell Williams' Happy to prove life in the area is carrying on as normal despite 2011's nuclear disaster

You've got to hand it to them: The video features some wacky characters

Enthusiasm: A huge number of people took part in the upbeat YouTube video

Participants were given a free rein to dance to the song in their own way, and the video they produced as a result was filmed at various locations including the Fukushima Train Station, local tourism attractions such as the hot springs, a rice paddy and vineyards, and a shopping mall.

Kumasaka filmed the video over two weeks in May and then released it last month, with 500,000 views so far.

She said: ‘With this video, I want you to know that we are also happy and healthy just like you. Please enjoy our dance and share our happiness. And many thanks to Pharrell for this great song.’

Williams's song, which repeats the phrase ‘because I'm happy’ with a light rhythm, was released late last year.

Food for thought: This Fukushima resident was clearly hungry for internet fame

Happy days: Participants were given a free rein to interpret the song in their own way

Three years after the March 2011 meltdowns, the Fukushima plant is still plagued by contaminated water

Creating a buzz: There have been over 1,000 comments on the Fukushima video

Since then, using it as the accompaniment to YouTube videos has become a global phenomenon.

There were also well over 1,000 comments on the Fukushima version with many people declaring that it was the best use of the hit song yet.

One user wrote: ‘[The video] cheered me up’ and another added ‘is it really filmed in Fukushima?’

JR Fukushima Station Master Yasunori Kano, who appeared in the video, said: ‘I hope that the video shows how attractive Fukushima is.’

Volunteers in Ishinoamki, Miyagi Prefecture, and in Rikuzen-Tataka, Iwate Prefecture, are also working on their own ‘Happy’ videos, which are expected to be released from early July.

More than three years after the March 2011 meltdowns, the Fukushima plant is still plagued by a massive amount of contaminated water.

Repeated water leaks from storage tanks and other mishaps have hampered a decommissioning effort that is expected to take decades.

Variety is the spice of life: The video was filmed in a number of locations
