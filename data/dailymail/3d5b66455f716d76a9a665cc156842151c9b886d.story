TV watchdogs have rapped Channel 5 for letting Celebrity Big Brother housemates talk about their sexual experiences and make 'rude food' while children were watching.

Housemates were shown discussing their first sexual encounters while Linda Nolan boasted about having 'loads of sex with other men' during an edition of the reality TV show.

Made In Chelsea's Ollie Locke and The Apprentice's Luisa Zissman made breasts and penises from dough during the same programme, first screened at 9.45pm on January 18 and then repeated at 11.30am the following day.

'Mildly risqué: CBB housemates Ollie Locke and Luisa Zissman were shown making rude shapes out of dough

Ofcom found that the programme had breached the rule that children must be protected by appropriate scheduling from unsuitable material.

Its ruling said: 'The cumulative effect of the humorous references to a penis and the use of sexual innuendos, together with the frank discussions on the topic of sexual experiences, resulted in an inappropriate, and prominent, sexual theme and adult tone.

'We therefore considered the material was unsuitable for children.'

The industry watchdog said viewing figures showed that, from a total audience of 290,000 viewers, 33,500 viewers had been aged 16 or under. This meant that children made up 12 per cent of the audience.

Meanwhile the offending show was watched by 8,800 children aged between four and nine.

Ofcom said the sexual material was not explicit and it was 'humorous in intent', but added that the content 'required more careful editing before broadcasting at 11.30 on a Sunday morning.'

Rude jokes: Ofcom criticised Channel 5 for not warning parents of the episode's unsuitable content

There had been no advance warning to help parents wishing to protect children from unsuitable material, the watchdog's ruling said.

It went on: 'We considered that these factors resulted in this material being inconsistent with audience expectations for the content broadcast on this public service channel at 11:30 at a weekend.

'We therefore concluded the material was not appropriately scheduled and the broadcast was in breach of the rule.'

A Channel 5 spokesman said that 'Cheeky conversation, rude language and mildly sexually suggestive innuendos' should be expected in pre-watershed broadcasts.

The episode had been checked before being broadcast on the Sunday morning after some content had been removed or 'bleeped.' He said the 'rude food' scenes had been only 'mildly risqué,' and the sexual discussions were 'not explicit, highly charged or erotic.'

But he said: 'We accept that, in hindsight, it may have been prudent to have ensured that an appropriate flagging was aired prior to the daytime repeat.'
