How was Valentine's Day for you last year?

Did you both snuggle up at the end of the evening, luxuriating in each other's arms, whispering sweet nothings?

Or did it end in a huge, stonking row with both of you on your sides, staring stonily at opposite walls?

Valentine's day is one of the two days in the year that couples argue the most, this is because we are often left disappointed, here Tracey Cox explains why he's not living up to your expectations 

If it's the latter, you're not alone. Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve are the two nights of the year couples are most likely to argue.

Why? Expectations are high - and men and women's idea of romance are streets apart.

Make this Valentine's run smoother by seeing things from a different perspective...

1. HE DIDN'T SEND FLOWERS TO WORK 

Why is it infinitely better for a huge, expensive bunch of flowers to arrive at the office rather than be delivered in person by him?

The show off factor, of course.

Everyone wants to look like the most adored person in the office and what if everyone except you got sent flowers?

Good reasons why he didn't:

From being low on funds to feeling intimidated by the way you look there are plenty of reasons why he isn't conforming to your idea of the perfect Valentine's date 

2. HE DIDN'T BOOK THE RIGHT RESTAURANT 

There are three Valentines' choices that go down well.

Dinner in your 'special' restaurant - where you met or he proposed or something else significantly romantic happened. Dinner in the hottest place in town (so you can boast the next day) or dinner somewhere expensive.

His 'Let's give V-Day the finger and head to the local pizza joint!' suggestion does not go down well.

Good reasons why he didn't:

Tracey says that it's important to bear in mind that his definition of romance isn't necessarily yours

3. HE DIDN'T TELL YOU HOW FAB YOU LOOKED 

Your hair's blow-dry glossy, you spent two week's salary on your dress, your shoes are so high, your little toe's already throbbing - and all he says after a quick once-over is 'Hi! Happy Valentine's Day.'

Would it kill him to say 'You look better than Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - on a good day'?

Good reasons why he didn't:

4. THE PRESENT DIDN'T COST ENOUGH

'It's the thought that counts' might apply when it's your five-year-old niece lovingly pressing an old sweet wrapper into your hand for Christmas.

But a hell of a lot of women think the more money he spends, the more he loves them.

Good reasons why he didn't spend up big:

5. HE WASN'T AFFECTIONATE ENOUGH

 You're smack bang in the middle of a packed restaurant, surrounded by tons of couples who are all over each other. He's not even holding your hand across the table or playing footsie.

Why he isn't:

6. HE DIDN'T SAY ROMANTIC THINGS

On every other day of the year, he's always coming out with the cutest, nicest comments about how much he adores you.

On the day when he's supposed to, nada. One strained 'I love you' and that was that.

Why he didn't:

7. HE DIDN'T PROPOSE  

You're checking your Champagne glass, digging around in the chocolate fondant with your spoon, eyeing off his jacket pocket to see if it's bulging.

Where is he hiding that damn ring?

Why he didn't:

It really doesn't mean he doesn't love you, if he doesn't make a fuss on Valentine's Day.

Some guys are just conscientious objectors to the concept and, let's be honest here, it takes little effort to call and order a bunch of red roses.

There are infinitely better ways to express love and his definition of romance isn't necessarily yours.

One of my all time favourite research statistics is the study where men in long-term relationships were asked to do something romantic for their wives.

Forty percent washed her car!

I rest my case.

@highlight

Valentine's Day is one of the two nights a year couples argue the most

@highlight

This is because we have massive expectations and are left disappointed

@highlight

Tracey Cox explains exactly why he might make mistakes this Saturday 

@highlight

Because you work with women who date bankers and if he can't compete, he figures you'd prefer his more modest bunch handed over privately.

@highlight

Because he baulked at paying a delivery fee that's tripled for one day of year.

@highlight

Because it seemed more practical to give them to you himself, since he was seeing you that night.

@highlight

Because it's excruciating to have to sit there and look loving and say all the right things in a restaurant he feels comfortable in, let alone one where he's terrified he'll pick up the wrong fork.

@highlight

He can't afford it.

@highlight

He figured cooking a meal for you himself was more special.

@highlight

You seriously do give Rosie a run for her money and he's suddenly paranoid he's not good-looking enough for you.

@highlight

He clocked you've gone to a lot of effort to look good and worried the present isn't right/expensive enough/you're upset because he didn't send flowers to work.

@highlight

He actually prefers you in your old skinny jeans and a T-shirt. You don't seem like you 'all done up'.

@highlight

He can't afford it and can't justify hiking up the credit card even higher when he's likely to need it for important things. Like rent.

@highlight

He secretly suspects you're a gold digger and wants to test whether you're with him for his money by not being extravagant.

@highlight

He didn't have a clue what to buy so procrastinated - and ended up in Paperchase half an hour before you were due to meet.

@highlight

He's inwardly cringing at how forced everyone else looks.

@highlight

He feels that if he follows suit, he'll look forced. Or clichéd. Or just plain stupid. Besides he can feel you turning into Ms Frosty Pops and he's scared he'll be rebuffed and look even more idiotic.

@highlight

He feels so self-conscious in this environment, he's scared he'll laugh.

@highlight

See above. Surrounded by all the cheesy hearts and pink balloons and red roses, he's already suffocating in sentiment.

@highlight

He thinks anything he says will seem disingenuous - that he's only saying it because he's supposed to.

@highlight

He resents being told to do something romantic on a certain day of the year just because society dictates it.

@highlight

He didn't think you'd want to share your anniversary with millions of other couples.

@highlight

He's planning on doing it somewhere private and more meaningful than in front of a room full of strangers.

@highlight

You've only been dating two months.
