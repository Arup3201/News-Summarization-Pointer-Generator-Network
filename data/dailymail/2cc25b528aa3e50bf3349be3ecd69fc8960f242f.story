Secret mission: Dillwyn Thomas, 88, was given instructions 'to blow Port Talbot to smithereens' during World War II if the Germans ever invaded

A sheep farmer had top secret orders to blow his hometown 'to smithereens' during World War II if the Nazis had invaded, he revealed for the first time today.

Dillwyn Thomas, 88, was given instructions on how to start a suicide guerrilla war in the hills around Port Talbot, South Wales.

The pensioner was part of a covert army unit created by Winston Churchill known as the Auxiliary Units.

They were spread across the country in a 
network of local groups tasked with mounting a resistance 
against the invaders who never came.

Dillwyn was working as an 18-year-old farm hand when he was shown how to blow the town's steelworks 'sky high'.

The pensioner, from Margam, near Port Talbot, has finally revealed the secret mission he was asked to carry out more than 70 years ago.

He said: 'We were told to blow-up the steelworks - we were told to blow Port Talbot to smithereens.

'We had access to every weapon you could imagine - daggers for prodding the enemy, guns for shooting the enemy, explosives for blowing up the enemy.

'They were kept in a secret underground bunker that only we knew about - ready for us in case of invasion.

'If the Germans had landed and it looked as though they were making inroads we were to blow the steel works, oil refinery, train line, and anything else which could have been of any use to them - then lay low in the countryside.

'We weren’t meant to fight the Germans head-on - there were nowhere near enough of us to make a difference and we weren’t sufficiently armed.

'But if we could slow up their progress, then the hope was that we could tie them up with ambushes and booby traps.

'Of course I’m delighted that it never came to that but I must admit that there’s a tiny part of me which is disappointed that I never got to test my training in battle.'

The Margam Auxiliary Unit was among a network of strategically placed, highly trained fighting groups dotted across the country, tasked with resisting German invasion.

With Port Talbot’s Margam Castle identified as a potential headquarters for German troops, Dillwyn and his fellow unit members were briefed with mounting a final resistance.

From 1940 Auxiliary Units consisted of between four and eight men, usually recruited from the most able members of the Home Guard, who also had an excellent local knowledge and the ability to live off the land.

Like 3,500 others, Dillwyn was trained on weekend courses at Coleshill House near Highworth, Wiltshire, in the arts of guerrilla warfare including assassination, unarmed combat, demolition and sabotage.

Dillwyn, who still farms in the area, said: 'The next thing I knew I was signing the Official Secrets Act, alongside five other local lads, who all worked on the Margam estate.

'We had no day-to-day tasks, we simply carried on as normal, but on a Sunday we would be taken under cover of darkness to a secret location and briefed.'

For decades after the war Dillwyn didn’t reveal his secret role - not even to his family.

He said: 'Nobody ever asked questions, not even my parents at the time.

'After the war was over we were never officially stepped down or told that our roles were over - we just sort of assumed they were and got on with life.

'I was friendly with the five others lads in the unit for years afterwards but we never spoke about our role during the war.

'Unfortunately, I am the only one of us still alive.'

Dillwyn said he got so used to keeping secrets that he didn’t tell his family about what he had done for another 30 years.

Now he has finally revealed his part in the secret war by writing a book called A View From the Main Ring.

Dillwyn said: 'Looking back now, the job we were given was one of huge responsibility, but as a young dimwit I never understood or appreciated the magnitude of what we were asked to do.

'I am just thankful that it never came to that, and can only pray to God that we are never forced into such a position again.'
