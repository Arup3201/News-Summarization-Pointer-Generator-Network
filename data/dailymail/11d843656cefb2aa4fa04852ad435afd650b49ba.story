Frank Lampard is set to make a sensational return to English football with Manchester City.

Lampard, 36, left Chelsea after 13 years this summer and joined City’s US team New York City FC last week. But it is understood that the England midfielder is now ready to sign a six-month loan deal with the Premier League champions.

Although the move would primarily allow Lampard to stay fit until he starts training with his Major League Soccer team in January, he is set to be included in City’s squad for both the Premier League and Champions League this season. Manuel Pellegrini’s side face Chelsea on Sunday, September 21.

Former Blues manager Carlo Ancelotti, in the US as part of Real Madrid's pre-season tour, expressed his surprise at the move before wishing the veteran midfielder luck.

'I didn’t know this. I'm really surprised because I thought he was coming here to play in USA to play,' said the Italian manager.

'Its too late for me to take him to Madrid but I'm really happy for Frank as I have a good memory of him. I wish him luck. He’s a good signing for Man City,' he added.

Lampard still has a number of options on the table but he is reluctant to follow New York’s other star signing David Villa to Australia for the rest of the year to keep fit at City’s other sister club Melbourne.

Speaking at his unveiling in New York last week, he said: ‘I will have to keep fit. I'll have to train at the very top level, whether that's on my own or with a club somewhere, I'll have to see.

‘Of course I'll keep fit and make sure my levels don't drop too much. When we come here for pre-season I want to be ready to go. I want to fly out of the blocks. I don't want to come out sluggish.’
