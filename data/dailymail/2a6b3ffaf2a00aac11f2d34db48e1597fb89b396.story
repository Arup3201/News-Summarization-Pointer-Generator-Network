A museum which yesterday became the victim of one of the biggest art heists in history has admitted that there were no guards on duty at  the time.

Seven paintings worth around £100million, including works by Picasso and Monet, were stolen from the Kunsthal Museum in the Dutch city of Rotterdam after thieves broke in at 3am.

The gang managed to bypass the sophisticated alarm system, in what police say was a well-prepared robbery.

Chris Marinello, director of the Art 
Loss Register, which tracks stolen artworks, said the smooth nature of 
the theft suggested the gang must have had inside information. ‘Those 
thieves got one hell of a haul,’ he added.

The paintings included Monet’s 
Waterloo Bridge and Charing Cross Bridge (both 1901), Picasso’s 
Harlequin Head (1971), Matisse’s Reading Girl In White And Yellow 
(1919)  and Lucian Freud’s Woman With Eyes Closed (2002).

Gauguin’s Girl in Front of Open Window (1898) and Meyer de Haan’s Autoportrait (1890) were also taken.

Dutch police confirmed a total of 
seven paintings were stolen from a museum exhibition showcasing a 
private collection of over 150 exhibits, and had only been open for a 
few days.

The theft is one of the art world's most dramatic in recent years, and one of the biggest ever in the Netherlands.

Roland Ekkers, a spokesman for Rotterdam police, said they received a 
call alerting them to the theft at around 3 a.m. local time on Tuesday.

‘The alarm system in the Kunsthal was supposed to be state of the art,’ Ekkers said.

‘Somehow the people responsible for this found a way in and a way out 
and they found time to take seven paintings. So that's something that is
 part of our investigation right now.’

The paintings stolen include two Claude Monet's: 'Charing Cross Bridge' and 'Waterloo Bridge', part of his famous London series.

Also taken were Pablo Picasso's 'Tete d'Arlequin', Henri Matisse's 'La Liseuse en Blanc et Jaune' and Lucien Freud's 'Woman with Eyes Closed', Paul Gaugin's 'Femme Devant une Fenetre Ouvertem dite La Fiancee' and Meyer de Hann's 'Autoportrait'.

Jop Ubbens, chairman of Christie's in Amsterdam, said the paintings would be worth ‘more than several million euros,’ with the Picasso the best known of the stolen works.

‘It's all about name and fame. So the Picasso is the best known. The least well-known is Meyer de Haan, which looks like a Gauguin, so maybe it was a mistake,’ he added.

Ubbens said the art heist was one of 
the biggest in the country, but ‘not as big as The Scream’, referring to
 the work by Edvard Munch, a version of which was stolen from a museum 
in Oslo in 2004 but later recovered.

In 2010, five paintings were stolen 
from the Musee d'Art Moderne in Paris including a Picasso and Matisse 
and estimated to be worth a combined $124 million.

However there is hope for a swift recovery of the stolen pieces as experts said it would be next to impossible for the thieves to sell such well-known works on the open market.

‘They are going to learn very quickly that these things cannot be sold,’ said Christopher Marinello, executive director of The Art Loss Register, which helps track down stolen works of art.

‘They don't even think about it sometimes. They may try and call and entice a ransom.’

He added, however, that it was 
unlikely the works had been stolen ‘to order’ from a wealthy collector, 
dismissing such theories as the realm of Hollywood.

‘I'm confident these will find their 
way back’" he said. ‘The police in this area are very good, very well 
organised. I would not be surprised to see them surfacing over the next 
few weeks.’

The Kunsthal exhibition, displaying a large part of the Triton Foundation's avant-garde
collection for the first time in one gallery, opened a few days ago to celebrate Kunsthal's 20th anniversary.

The Kunsthal, meaning 'art gallery' in Dutch, is a display space that has no permanent 
collection of its own.

The
 Triton Foundation exhibition was showing works by more than 150 famed artists, 
including Alexander Calder, Paul Cezanne, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali, 
Edgar Degas, Marcel Duchamp, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, August 
Rodin, and Andy Warhol.

Although a private collection, the 
curators at the Triton Foundation aim to have their art on display for 
the public, and pieces have been shown in the past.

However, the current presentation was the first time the entire collection had been exhibited together.

The collection was put together by 
the Cordia family, which made its fortune in shipping and oil and which 
ranks among the 100 richest families in the Netherlands, according to 
Dutch media.

The family is estimated to own about 
330 million euros' worth of assets, according to Dutch magazine Quote, 
which makes lists similar to U.S. magazine Forbes's ranking of 
billionaires.

In a statement, the museum's chairman
 Willem van Hassel said the museum will be closed Tuesday, and he 
referred all questions to the police.
