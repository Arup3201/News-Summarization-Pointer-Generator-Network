Some couples take up hiking to keep their relationship alive, giving them a mutual interest.

This husband and wife duo, however, have taken their diving hobby to new extremes.

Record freedivers Eusebio and Christina Saenz de Santamaria, regularly dive to depths of 80metres or more - in just one breath.

Ever wanted to swim with dolphins? Becoming one of the pod might be a dream too far, but not for skilled freediver Eusebio Saenz de Santamaria and his wife Christina

They use freediving as a means for exploration and adventure, 'to discover abstract worlds, new perspectives and to push the boundaries of our bodies and minds'.

Through their spectacular photographs, we are offered a glimpse into their other unique and watery world.

Kitted out: They wear special freediving suits, masks and enormous flippers to help them reach depth of up to 80m and allowing them to keep up with a school of dolphins

Looking at these stunning pictures, it is hard to believe neither diver is using breathing apparatus.

Looking completely at home under the waves, the couple wear special diving suits with face masks and enormous flippers that act like a fish's tail.

The couple, who share their underwater experiences on their website, oneoceanonebreath.com, both hold records for their freedivnig skills.

Sharing: Through their photography and videos of their underwater adventures they like to share their incredible experiences with others

Performance: The couple are so comfortable and relaxed underwater they even have time to act out comical poses

Eusebio, from Bilbao in northern Spain, has been involved in freediving for over a decade.

In 2004 Eusebio co-founded apnea-total.com, one of the world’s largest freediving education systems. Since this time, Eusebio has educated and trained thousands of freedivers from beginner level through to the professional as well as world champion spear-fishermen.

Eusebio’s personal performances include being a former National Record holder for Spain in the three depth categories. He is comfortably diving to depths of 100 metres.

Christina from Sydney, Australia has been freediving since 2005 after completing her first freediving courses at Eusebio's company Apnea Total.

Since then, Christina has trained and competed in freediving competitions worldwide and currently holds the Australian National Records in two depth disciplines making her the deepest Australian female freediver in history.

Wildlife: Their exceptional freediving talents means they can discover and experience being in contact with creatures of the deep, without the use of noisy breathing apparatus

Serene: The couple even make the ascent look serene 
and enjoyable. Here they rise up from Mexico's cenotes, or 'pits', which
was an 'eerie' experience

She now teaches freediving with Eusebio. She is diving to depths of 80 metres.

The freediving couple live for six months of the year on the tiny Thai island of Koh Tao, and for the rest of the year they travel the world exploring new underwater areas.

The pictures where Eusebio is barefoot and 'standing' on the ocean's rocky bottom were taken in cenotes near Tulum in the Yucatan Peninsula, in south east Mexico. 

'Freediving 'The Pit' was a surreal and magical experience, the cathedral light dramatically pierced the cool dark waters and provided an ethereal backlight to the beckoning caves and caverns below,' they said.

The depth of these pits are often unknown due to the swirling white halocline that hovers at 30 metres, a chemical reaction between layers of fresh and salt water, through which the sunlight barely pierces and the dark depths lie beneath.

The deepest cenote that they freedived was 75 metres in vertical depth called La Laguna, beneath the halocline they were freediving in pitch black with only glow sticks on their dive rope to guide them.

'We only discovered the bottom of La Laguna at 75 metres when our feet touched the silty bottom. Freediving La Laguna was a very eerie and dark experience!'

Inquisitive: While most divers remain a few feet from the surface, Eusebio and Christian can sink to the seabed and experience the joys of inquisitive wildlife

The Cozumel wreck, off Mexico's coast: Being able to freedive to such depths gives a whole new element of fun and freedom when exploring shipwrecks together

When they explored the Cozumel Wreck, also known as Felipe Xicoténcatl C-53, located off the island of Cozumel off the Mexican coast, they had fun with their pictures.

The wreck lies on the sandy bottom of depths between 25 to 30 metres. The Felipe Xicoténcatl was a U.S. made Admirable-Class minesweeper built in 1944 for the Navy during World War II.

In 1962 the Wreck was sold to the Mexican Navy and was retitled ARM General Felipe Xicoténcatl (C53) where it guarded the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea aiding search and rescue operations and watching for illegal arms and drug trafficking. 

It was sunk deliberately in 1999 for the purpose of recreational diving and as an artificial reef for marine life and corals.

The incredible  dolphin shots, as well as the inquisitive seal and tutrle were all taken while on a sailing and freediving trip to Hawaii. 

Mutual love: The couple travel the world together for six months of the year exploring new hidden worlds under the waves

They were along the Kona coast of the island and woke early each morning to freedive with a pod of wild Hawaiian Spinner Dolphins who would return to the bay for play and rest after a night fishing in the deep oceans.

The pod was over 60 strong and very curious.

'The dolphins would approach and play with us for many hours during the morning of their own free will and could leave at anytime if they wish.

'Freediving with wild dolphins is exhilerating and enchanting, their intense curiosity and intelligence is captivating and their movement in the water skilful and elegant.'
