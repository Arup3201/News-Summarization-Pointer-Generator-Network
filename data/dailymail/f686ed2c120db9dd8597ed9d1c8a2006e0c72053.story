It seems the One Direction boys have another hit on their hands. But it's their perfume that's setting the tills ringing this time,

Their scent, Our Moment, launched at Harrods on August 25 and is set to earn the boys over £360,000 in its first week on sale in the UK, according to beauty and fragrance experts.

The six-figure sum is calculated from
 pre-orders plus sales of over 3,000 bottles 
at Harrods in London in just two days.

 CEO Rakesh Aggarwal said: 'Our Moment is predicted to sell around 
180,000 units in the first week alone, making it one of the fastest selling
 fragrances of all time.

'It’s certainly looking like it’s going to be the most successful celebrity perfume launch of the year and sales in America are expected to be bigger still,' says Aggarwal.

On the basis of 180,000 sales of the most popular 30ml Eau de Parfum, which retails at £19.99, the turnover for the first week will come in at nearly £3.6m.

Although the exact deal that the X Factor boy band struck with the perfume company is closely guarded secret, most industry insiders have estimated that Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson will personally earn around £2 for every 30ml Eau de Parfum bottle sold, which means the group is due to bank £360,000 in 7 days.

The scent is due to go on sale at The Fragrance Shop on September 9. 'We launched the pre-order for Our Moment on August 1 and since then have taken over 20,000 pre-orders from across Europe,' says spokesperson Daniel Thompson.

'With such an interest we made the 
decision that Our Moment will need its own warehouse to help keep up 
with demand for what looks to be the biggest celebrity launch of 2013.'

' I found Our Moment very sweet and a tad 
too heavy for daytime for grown-ups - and even an hour after first 
spraying this, the smell still lingered over me like a huge cloud of 
frangipani and candyfloss. I have nothing against frangipani, it's just 
combined with everything else that the overall effect is a bit cloying.'

Other
 products and gift sets are to be added to the range in the next month, 
just in time for the Christmas market which accounts for around 70 per 
cent of annual fragrance sales, and the boys are expected to earn around
 £2m from perfume sales over the festive season.

Escentual.com boss Rakesh Aggarwal said:
 'I would anticipate turnover will top £10m for the range over Christmas
 - which would see One Direction around £2m richer by the end of the 
festive season, just from UK perfume sales.'

With such hysteria surrounding the 
launch, it's almost immaterial what it actually smells like. Fans are 
buying into their favourite band, not following their noses. Check out our beauty expert's verdict in the box, right.

Only time will tell whether it can beat 
the best-selling celebrity fragrance of all time, White Diamonds by the 
late Elizabeth Taylor - the scent brought in $75 million at retail in 2011, according to Euromonitor.
