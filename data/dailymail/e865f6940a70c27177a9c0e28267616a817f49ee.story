Time to put the credit cards away because Jose Canseco's shot-off finger is not for sale after all.

The former MLB slugger, and admitted doper, severed his left-hand middle finger last month when his handgun accidentally misfired at home while he was cleaning the firearm. 

Doctors reattached the digit, but last week the 50-year-old announced on Twitter that the limb had fallen off and that he planned to sell it on eBay, along with his flashy gun.

Now he says the story about the finger falling off in the middle of a poker tournament was all part of an elaborate joke he devised after seeing a fake finger for sale in a Halloween shop, TMZ reports.

So much for owning a piece of baseball history.

Canseco had sports fans gearing up to start a bidding war last week when he wrote a series of prank tweets, saying he was going to sell his finger and gun.

'I will soon put the finger that fell off in the poker tournament on eBay for sale,' Canseco tweeted Monday night. 

'The eBay ad will read slightly used middle finger with 462 home runs could be used as a stirring straw for drinks,' he joked. 

Canesco went on to offer the finger as a package deal, with the 45-caliber Remington gun that shot it off on October 29.

However, there were signs that it was a joke then since firearms and human remains are not allowed to be sold on eBay. 

Canseco's lighthearted attitude about the painful injury is marked change from last month, when he broke down in tears about the incident to Inside Edition.

Describing what happened, he said: 'At first I heard it go off and I actually grabbed the gun and put it on the table.

'(I) thought nothing had happened. Then I look at my hand and my finger’s blown off.' 

Canseco explained the bullet only narrowly missed his fiancée, swimwear model Leila Knight, who was standing nearby. She quickly ran to his aid.

'I was telling Jose not to look at his hand because he kept saying that he felt nauseous and said he was going to pass out,' Knight told Inside Edition.

Accident: The former MLB star, who admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during his long career, accidentally shot off his left-hand middle finger last month while cleaning his handgun at home in Las Vegas.

Knight wrapped his hand in a towel and called 911. 'I’m just glad nothing happened to her (Knight),' Canseco said.

'If it’s a lesson having to lose a finger, so be it.'

Knight said her fiancée had been at a shooting range a few days earlier. He then decided to clean the weapon but didn't realize it was still loaded.

'The middle finger was hanging by a thread, and I wrapped his hand in a towel and then called 911,' Knight told the newspaper. 

'He blew away an artery and a big bone chunk.' 

The Cuban-American dominated the MLB with his hitting prowess in the 1980s, but later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs for much of his career.

Canseco is a right-handed batter who hit 462 career home runs and was a six-time All-Star.

He also played for Texas, Boston, Toronto, Tampa Bay, the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox during a career that spanned from 1985 to 2001.  

It could have been much worse: In an emotional interview last month, Canseco described how the bullet almost hit his fiancée Leila. The couple seen above in a picture posted to Leila's Instagram on November 19
