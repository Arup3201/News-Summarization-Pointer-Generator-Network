The history of Formula One is littered with dramatic last-day title shootouts in which legends such as Lauda, Hunt and Schumacher have put everything on the line... and all without the need to award double points. Ahead of Sunday’s showdown we look at F1’s most thrilling finales. 

1950 — Monza, Italy

The first Formula One season came down to a fight between the three Fs of Alfa Romeo: Nino Farina, Juan Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli. Farina, with his straight-arm driving style, led but was being harried by Fangio until his gearbox broke. Fangio rejoined the race in his team-mate Piero Taruffi’s car but was hampered by further gremlins. With Fagiolo way back in third, Farina, a qualified doctor and cavalry officer, won to become Formula One’s first champion.

1959 — Sebring, USA

Jack Brabham led the table coming into the final race but Stirling Moss, also in a Cooper T51, was just 5.5 points behind after winning the previous two grands prix. Ferrari’s Tony Brooks was also in contention. Moss, who had taken pole, retired with a broken gearbox. Brooks was bumped on the first lap and took a long pit stop. It was all clear for Brabham to win the race and the title. But he ran out of fuel. He got out and pushed the car over the line for fourth. It was enough for the championship, too.

1964 — Mexico City, Mexico

John Surtees became the only man to win a world championship on two and four wheels. His rivals were Graham Hill, who headed the standings, and Jim Clark, who needed to win the race. Hill was running third, enough for the title, but he collided with Lorenzo Bandini and his hopes were dashed. Clark, who started on pole, was driving brilliantly at the front only for his Lotus to start leaking oil, eventually forcing him to stop. Bandini let his Ferrari team-mate Surtees through for second — and history.

1976 — Fuji, Japan

‘By all the laws of humanity,’ wrote James Hunt on the front page of the following day’s Daily Mail, ‘I should not be motor racing champion of the world.’ It had been an insane climax to an insane season. Ferrari’s Niki Lauda had almost burned to death at the Nurburgring, allowing Hunt to narrow the gap during the Austrian’s recuperation. It came down to Fuji. The weather was so bad that Lauda retired after one lap. Hunt carried on, took third and the title.

1984 — Estoril, Portugal

The closest race ever in numerical terms, Niki Lauda beating McLaren team-mate Alain Prost by half a point. Prost won the race, equalling Jim Clark’s record of seven wins in a season (although when the championship started in 1950 there were just six grands prix in Europe as well as the Indianapolis race). But Lauda, helped by Nigel Mansell spinning off, came second and that was enough for his third and final title.

1986 — Adelaide, Australia

All seemed under control for Nigel Mansell — he was in third place, enough to beat his title rivals Nelson Piquet and Alain Prost. But on lap 64 at Dequetteville Terrace his tyre blew violently. ‘Look at that,’ exclaimed Murray Walker on the BBC. Mansell somehow kept his Williams out of the wall but his race was over. Prost became world champion but Mansell consoled himself with becoming ‘People’s Champion’ and BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

1994 — Adelaide

A bitter day that, rightly or wrongly, shaped the reputation of Michael Schumacher as a dirty fighter. The German, who started the race one point ahead of Damon Hill, hit the wall in his Benetton. This allowed Hill to get alongside Schumacher, who then turned his car in on the British favourite. Both men were out of the race, making Schumacher champion.

1997 — Jerez, Spain

Schumacher was again cast as villain. He turned in on Jacques Villeneuve at Dry Sack corner, but this time it did not work for him. Schumacher ended up beached in the gravel, Villeneuve survived and took third and the title. Schumacher was disqualified from the championship and admitted he regretted the incident — a rare mea culpa.

2008 — Sao Paulo, Brazil

Perhaps the most dramatic final day of all. In spitting rain, Felipe Massa of Ferrari crossed the line first. Lewis Hamilton needed to finish fifth or better to win the title but the Briton was sixth as Massa won. But in the next few seconds, Hamilton passed Toyota’s Timo Glock, who was struggling on slick tyres on the wet track. News of Hamilton’s late surge was relayed to the Massa family, who were already celebrating in the Ferrari garage. Their faces fell. Hamilton won the title and Massa, in front of his home support, conducted himself graciously in numbing defeat.

2012 — Sao Paulo

Poor Fernando Alonso, who lost out on the title on the final day of the season for the third time. The hero of the day was Sebastian Vettel. The left side of his Red Bull was severely bruised in a collision with Bruno Senna on the fourth corner of the race. Ferrari’s Alonso, trailing by 13 points at the start, finished second. Vettel, in a superior car, fought back doggedly to sixth. It was enough for his third title at the young age of 25.
