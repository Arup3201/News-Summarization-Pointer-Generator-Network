Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has been in contact with the agent for Barcelona's South Korean wonderkid Seung-Woo Lee, reports Marca.

A gem of Barcelona’s youth system, Lee, who turned 17 in January, is high on Real's list of transfer targets after the La Liga leaders boosted their scouting budget for top young talent. 

Lee has been unable to show off his prodigious talents for Barca’s youth team due to FIFA-imposed transfer sanctions.

Lionel Messi and Neymar are the stars of 2015 so far

Lee, who is currently only allowed to play in friendlies and international matches for the South Korean youth team, has pledged his commitment to the Catalan side but such statements haven’t deterred Real.

Still in Spain, Mundo Deportivo have hailed Barcelona superstars Lionel Messi and Neymar as the masters of 2015 so far.

‘Nobody in the important competitions has beaten Messi and Neymar’s goalscoring figures in 2015,’ the paper states.

‘Between Leo and Ney they have scored 17 goals, two more than all the Real Madrid players put together.’

Since their January 4 loss to David Moyes' Real Sociedad, Barca have won eight matches on the bounce scoring a total of 29 goals in all competition - although 15 of those have come from three thrashings of lowly Elche.

In their last match, the Argentine and the Brazilian scored either side of Rafinha in their 3-2 win over Villareal.

In Italy, La Gazzetta Dello Sport lament a 'small market' after the January transfer window closed without any major moves.

They give the top clubs marks out of 10 for their transfer work - Roma 6.5, Napoli 6.5, AC Milan 6, Inter 6 – with Juventus not being graded as they ‘had nothing to fix’ given they’re seven points clear of Roma at the top of the Serie A.

Corriere dello Sport declares AC Milan and Inter Milan ‘the stars’ of the window saying Filippo Inzaghi can now prepare for ‘the big relaunch’ of his apparently sleeping giants while the paper also says that Roberto Mancini has ‘revolutionised’ the Nerazzurri's squad.
