The widow of the first victim of Jihadi John has called for a British 'bounty on his head' to encourage his ISIS associates to give him up. 

Dragana Haines' husband aid worker David Haines, 44, was the first British hostage to be killed on screen by Jihadi John in an ISIS propaganda video released last September. 

Mrs Haines said she believes the British Government should have put up a bounty at the time of her husband's death.  

Last week Jihadi John was named as Mohammed Emwazi, a 26-year-old university graduate from London who was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 watchlist. 

Dragana Haines (pictured with David Haines and their daughter) said she would like to see the British Government stump up a bounty for information about Jihadi John, who brutally executed her husband 

After footage of the first of the brutal killings emerged last year the US Senate approved a $10million reward for information leading to his arrest. 

Now Mrs Haines, who lives with her four-year-old daughter in Athea, is calling for the British government to follow suit. 

She told Benedict Moore-Bridger at the Evening Standard: 'I am sure some of his mates would sell him. I know they are dedicated to some cause but also not all are so honourable, whatever that may mean for them, and they should go for that 'carrot.'' 

Scottish aid worker Mr Haines, 44, was brutally executed by Emwazi in September after being seized in Syria in 2013.

Mrs Haines has previously said she would like to see Jihadi John captured alive so he can face justice. She said she would also like to try and find out why he carried out the brutal killings of her husband and other hostages.

She added: 'A British bounty should have been put on his head at the time.'

The widow said she felt David Cameron should have acted to put up a reward for information before more people were murdered. 

She also said she had a 'mess of feelings' for Emwazi's family who she said must have had 'high hopes' for their son, but she was baffled as to if they could ever be able to forgive him.  

Mr Haines' other daughter, Bethany, 17, has previously said she would like to see her father's murderer killed. 

She said: 'I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there's a bullet between his eyes.'

Emwazi was unmasked as the brutal ISIS executioner last week.

The 26-year-old, who studied computer programming at the University of Westminster, is said to have travelled to the Middle East three years ago and later joined ISIS.

After graduating from university in May 2009, Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain.

En route he stopped in Amsterdam, where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia, home of the militant group Al Shabaab.

He claimed he was harassed by the security services, and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Emwazi is also said to have featured as Jihadi John in the execution videos of British aid worker Alan Henning, as well as U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers.

Since his identity was uncovered it has emerged that his father, Jasem, disowned him when he learned he was going to fight in Syria. 

Emwazi's family claimed asylum in the UK and won refugee status in 1996 and have claimed thousands in benefits. Housing the Islamic State executioner and his relatives in affluent parts of London has cost taxpayers up to £400,000.
