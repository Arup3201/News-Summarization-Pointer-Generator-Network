The flu jab crisis deepened last night after officials admitted they had suspected the vaccine was ineffective last summer – but failed to take action.

The Government’s public health agency announced late on Thursday that this year’s flu vaccine worked for only 3 per cent of patients.

That is because the main strain of the virus has mutated to such an extent that it no longer matches the jab, which was developed almost a year ago.

Figures suggest the infection has already claimed the lives of thousands of elderly patients who would have mistakenly assumed they were protected. Death rates are 40 per cent higher than last year.

There is also evidence that babies and young children have died from the virus because mortality rates for last month were ‘higher than expected’.

But yesterday Professor Nick Phin, director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Public Health England, said they had been made aware that a mutant strain had emerged in Australia ‘last summer’.

He said that the flu viruses that arrive in the UK tend to mirror those which have been present in the Southern Hemisphere during their winter, which is six months earlier than ours.

In the United States the government issued a warning in early December before the flu season had begun that it could be ‘potentially severe’.

The Center For Disease Control sent out a statement on December 4 stating that scientists were aware that certain mutant strains of the virus were circulating which may be resistant to the jab.

Patients at high risk – the elderly, pregnant women and those with underlying health complaints – were urged to see a doctor as soon as they had flu-like symptoms including a runny nose, fever, cough or aches and pains. Doctors were told to prescribe antiviral medications to these patients as soon as they suspected flu.

But otherwise healthy individuals were urged to stay at home, rather than seeing a doctor, to prevent spreading it to more vulnerable groups.

Scientists in the US have since carried out detailed research to assess the effectiveness of the jab and the findings have been shared with the public.

One such study published last month suggested they were just 23 per cent effective, although rates vary between states.

Professor Phin said a further warning was sounded in early December when scientists detected the same mutant virus had arrived in Britain – but it wasn’t deemed serious because cases were only in ‘low numbers’.

But in the US government officials were far more concerned and warned the public two months ago to prepare for a ‘potentially severe flu season’ because the vaccines might not work.

Elderly patients, pregnant women and those with long-term conditions were urged to seek help as soon as they experienced symptoms and doctors were told to prescribe them Tamiflu, an antiviral treatment for flu.

Officials at the US Center For Disease Control also advised otherwise healthy adults to stay at home if they became ill so as not to spread the virus.

But there were no similar warnings in Britain and experts at Public Health England just hoped the same mutant strain that was rampant in Australia and America would not arrive here.

There are now growing concerns that deaths could have been avoided and vulnerable patients prevented from becoming seriously ill had officials followed the same precautions.

Roger Goss, of campaign group Patient Concern, said: ‘It’s extremely worrying. People who had the jabs should have been made aware that they needed to be more careful not to catch the virus and more alert to symptoms.

‘This failure to be open and honest may have contributed to some of the thousands of deaths.’

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, said: ‘It beggars belief that health officials weren’t aware just how badly the vaccine was working a long time ago.’

The crisis has come about because the vaccines are developed in February, ten months before the flu season usually gets under way in Britain in December. 

The NHS spends around £100million each year on the flu vaccination programme, with each jab costing £7.60. Although it is never totally effective, it usually protects around 60 per cent of patients (file picture)

Experts predicted H3N2 (pictured) would be the most dominant virus but it has now mutated to such an extent that it no longer matches the vaccine - which was developed almost a year ago

Scientists from the World Health Organisation predict which three main strains of flu are likely to be circulating and the jabs are manufactured to protect against them. 

Dr John McCauley, of the Medical Research Council, said the decision was ‘not straightforward’ this year because there are two strains in circulation.

Warning: Professor Nick Phin, director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Public Health England, said they had been made aware that a mutant strain had emerged ‘last summer’

Experts said this year’s vaccine’s ineffectiveness was the worst in at least 20 years. Although it is never failsafe, it usually protects around 60 per cent of patients.

A spokesman for Public Health England said: ‘We saw that there were going to be drifts but we thought it was going to be less significant.’ Asked when they had first become aware of the mutation, the official initially said August and then clarified it to ‘within the last few months’.

A spokesman for the Prime Minister would not confirm if Government officials were made aware of the mutant strain in March. The spokesman added: ‘The current vaccine is still protecting against two strains of flu so there is still a benefit to getting the vaccine.’

Experts now fear the death toll for this winter from flu and cold weather will surpass 40,000, the worst in 15 years.

Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that there were 25,231 deaths in the over-65s in the two weeks leading up to January 23, a 40 per cent rise on last year.

And the most recent weekly flu report from Public Health England states that deaths in the under-fives in January were ‘higher than expected’, although it does not provide figures.

In normal years, the majority of the over-65s are protected from flu as they receive the jab for free on the NHS. Children aged two to four are also offered the jab while toddlers and babies will have some protection from their mothers being vaccinated in pregnancy.

What’s gone wrong?

Health officials announced on Thursday that this year’s flu vaccine protected only 3 per cent of patients. The vaccine was developed nearly a year ago and since then the virus has mutated so it no longer matches. This is unprecedented as although the vaccine is never failsafe, it normally protects at least 60 per cent of patients.

Why didn’t health officials alert the public sooner?

Public Health England, the responsible Government agency, says it wasn’t sure of the extent of the problem until a few days ago when research into the lack of effectiveness was published. But it knew the virus had mutated elsewhere in August and hoped that strain wouldn’t arrive in Britain. The US government was much more alert to the problem and issued a warning in early December before the flu season had arrived. This told at-risk patients to seek help as soon as they experienced symptoms and doctors to prescribe Tamiflu, a prescription medication that reduces the severity of flu.

I’m in the ‘at-risk’ patient group – what should I do?

It’s not too late to get the flu jab if you are over 65, pregnant or have an underlying health condition such as asthma. Although it doesn’t protect against the main mutant strain, it should still protect against two other types that are circulating in some areas of the country and may become more widespread later this winter. Flu levels are much lower now than they were a month ago but you should still follow basic hygiene to avoid catching it. This includes washing hands, disinfecting surfaces and avoiding close contact with others who are ill.

Tamiflu is available only on prescription and your GP will prescribe it if you are an at-risk patient with flu

Is another vaccine available?

No. The vaccines take nine to ten months to produce and none have yet been developed to prevent this mutant strain.

Should I be stocking up on Tamiflu?

No. Tamiflu is available only on prescription and your GP will prescribe it if you are an at-risk patient with flu. There is no reason otherwise healthy patients should take this drug to prevent flu as it can cause serious and unpleasant side effects. These include headaches, dizziness, cough, sickness, indigestion and, less commonly, heart problems, seizures and eczema. Opinions are also divided as to whether it prevents flu in patients who don’t yet have the virus.

How much has this cost taxpayers?

The NHS spends around £100million a year on its flu immunisation campaign which offers the jab free of charge to vulnerable groups. A further £1.5million goes towards a marketing campaign with TV and radio adverts urging at-risk patients to come forward for their jabs. But officials insist it hasn’t all been a waste of money as the jabs may still protect against other strains of flu that could emerge later this year.

What will happen next year?

Scientists from the World Health Organisation will meet this month to predict which strains of flu are likely to be present next winter – and vaccine production will get under way. But the vaccines will almost certainly be developed to protect against this mutant strain of H3N2 in case it is still in circulation. Experts hope this winter has just been a one-off and next year’s jabs will resume the usual effectiveness level of at least 60 per cent. And they say it is crucial that vulnerable groups receive the vaccine as normal next autumn as it remains the best way of preventing flu.
