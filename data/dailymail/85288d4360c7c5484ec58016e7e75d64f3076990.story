She hobnobbed with royalty, befriended the men of the Household Division and is responsible for some of the most iconic portraits of the Suffragette movement in existence.

And yet, despite her many achievements, the incredible life and works of Christina Broom, the UK's first female press photographer remain relatively unknown.

But all that could be about to change courtesy of the Museum of London, which recently acquired more than 2,500 Broom photographs and is to put a selection on display from next month.

The free exhibition, which concentrates on her images of the Great War, includes a rare shot of Rudyard Kipling's only son John who was killed at Loos aged 18, as well as many others.

So who was Christina Broom? Born in 1862 in London's Chelsea, the future photographer lived a conventional life until a cricketing accident in 1903 left her husband Albert an invalid.

Forced to become the main breadwinner for her family, Broom borrowed a box camera and started photographing street scenes with plans to turn her work into postcards.

'Her story is largely untold,' explains Anna Sparham, curator of photographs at the Museum of London. 'She became the breadwinner for her family after her husband was injured in a cricket accident and she had to earn a living for her daughter Winifred.

'She started by taking photographs of street views with a view to selling them but actually, the majority of her work took her in a different direction.'

Portrait of photographer: Christina Broom became a photographer in 1903 at the age of 40

That direction proved to be an unusual one. Living close to the Chelsea Barracks, Broom soon found her way inside and began taking photos - both formally and informally - of the soldiers of the Household Cavalry who were based there.

Just a year after beginning her career, Broom was appointed official photographer to the Household Division - a step that would lead to some of the most important images ever taken.

By 1914, as war with Germany drew nearer, Broom had become firmly established, selling photographs to newspapers and magazines alike - many of which featured her soldier friends.

'Christina's wartime photographs actually cover a huge range of subject matter so within the war period, you do see her focus changing,' adds Sparham.

'At the beginning, you get people mobilising and then the activities going on through to the injured soldiers returning.

'She attends a tea party at Buckingham Palace that the King and Queen hold for wounded soldiers in 1916 and you really do get the sense from many of her images that she's an insider, she's part of the war and that this is her contribution.'

Her meetings with King George V, both before, during and after the war, would prove a fateful one and the increasingly close relationship she enjoyed with the royal family led to some of her most impressive scoops.

'Because Christina is working within the 
barracks, she becomes well known to the King and this leads to a 
relationship where she's allowed great privileges and access to major 
royal events and special occasions and also to the royal family quite 
directly,' explains Sparham.

'She's given an exclusive commission with the Prince of Wales 
and produces a lovely portrait of a very young prince.

'And she was the 
only person allowed in to see King Edward VII when he died and was lying 
in state. She was allowed into Westminster Abbey to photograph him at 
4am in the morning.'

But her work wasn't all war and royalty. Some of her most famous images feature the Suffragette movement, then at its height, as well as society events such as the Oxford/Cambridge boat race.

'I think what's so intriguing about 
Christina's work is her character and how that comes through in who and 
what she photographs,' adds Sparham.

'Bearing in mind she's this small-framed lady 
working in this quite often male-dominated environment, she
 has this ability to really pull people together to form lovely 
compositions.

'She seizes their attention and you always get a sense of 
her relationship with her subjects, whether that's the suffragettes or 
powerful soldiers going off to war.'

Broom, adds Sparham, would have needed to be quite the character herself, as well as determined, as she pursued a career that was a far cry from the trajectory expected of a woman at the beginning of the 20th Century.

'Christina would have had to have been quite a determined lady,' says Sparham. 'She's described as quite formidable and I think to embrace the world of photography, which within her world was fairly unique, it would have been quite a brave thing to do.'

Christina Broom, a new free display at Museum of London exploring Christina Broomâ€™s photographs of military life in London during the First World War, runs from the 4th April until the 28th September 2014. See museumoflondon.org.uk for more information.
