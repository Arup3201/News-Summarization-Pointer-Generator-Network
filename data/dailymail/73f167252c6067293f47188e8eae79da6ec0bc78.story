He's not known for his friendships with the Royal Family but actor Martin Sheen looked remarkably at ease as he posed with Princess Beatrice at a London event last night.

Joining Mr Sheen and the Princess was Holly Branson, who was enjoying her first solo night out since becoming the mother of twins Etta and Artie in December.

The unlikely trio were at the Bulgari Hotel in central London for a gala dinner held in support of We Day, which is part of a charity movement that aims to give young people more understanding of global events.

Ms Branson will co-chair a day of festivities on Friday and last night gave a speech to an audience that included her father Sir Richard Branson and her brother Sam.

Sam is himself a new father with wife Isabella Antruther-Gough-Calthorpe giving birth to the couple's first child, a daughter Eva-Deia, late last month.

Like the Branson clan, Princess Beatrice, who recently embarked on a finance course in the US, is a supporter of We Day, as is her cousin Prince Harry.

Ahead of the event, she took to Twitter to declare her support, writing: 'Proud to be supporting @weday this Friday @HollyBranson is making the opening speech, good luck you’ll do great.'

Beatrice, 26, has long been close to Holly, 33, with the pair regularly holidaying together as well as taking part in joint charitable ventures.

Although the trio have not been photographed together before, Mr Sheen is, it seems, their newest recruit, with the 74-year-old actor set to speak at Friday's event at Wembley alongside all three Bransons.

Last year's event, which also featured actor Clive Owen, saw Prince Harry take to the stage at Wembley Arena, where he called on young people to get involved with charity work.

'Some people don’t think it’s cool to help others…personally, I think it’s the coolest thing in the world,' he enthused.

While this year's event may not have a royal speaker, it certainly made up for it with the launch dinner at the Bulgari Hotel where guests were served seared beef fillet and gianduja [a type of hazelnut infused Italian chocolate] mousse ahead of speeches at the end of the night.
