‘It was totally a freak accident. The car throttle got stuck when it was being moved to the trailer. It was not hopping. It was not performing in any shape or form,’ Andre Pierson of the National Lowrider Association told NBC4.

To avoid a large group of spectators, the driver swerved and hit a stack of water bottles on pallets, estimated at 12 feet high and 500 pounds in weight. The pallets fell on Mia crushing her and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

‘It appeared there was a vehicle accident or a vehicle had struck a pallet rack inside that held several pallets of bottled water,’ Brent Hayward, a division chief for the Santa Fe Springs Fire Department, told Press-Telegram.

Car hopping is when so-called low-rider cars show off their customized hydraulics systems - which can make the vehicles jump several feet in the air, often above the heads of surrounding audience members.

The event was held at a property belonging to CBM Hydros, formerly known as KoolAid Hydraulics, that installs the suspension systems required for hopping.

There have been no arrests and authorities have describing the death as a ‘tragic accident.’

On Monday evening dozens of supporters lined an Inglewood street asking drivers and passersby for donations for the victim's family to help pay for Mia’s funeral.

‘We're here to help him, the family, the mother - you know, whatever the low riders can do for him, we're here. We're family, that's what it is. Low-riding is family,’ the owner of Low Life Hydraulics in Inglewood said. 

On Facebook, a page called 'Lowrider Boulevard' said donations for the family were being accepted at an address in Inglewood where Low Life Hydraulics is located.

‘RIP lil Mia Chapman. She passed last night at a Lowrider Show, forever 7 years Young. …She always helped & Loved the Lowriders,' read a post from Monday.
