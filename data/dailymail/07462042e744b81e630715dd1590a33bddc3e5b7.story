It is the question that has been dominating Washington dinner parties for weeks – could the once-golden First Couple of the United States really be heading for the rocks?

If rumours are to be believed, the 21-year marriage of Barack and Michelle Obama has been racked by screaming rows, allegations of infidelity and a string of jealous fights.

While the White House has refused to comment on the reports there has been a distinct frostiness in the air between the couple in recent months.

OCTOBER 31, 2013 Sweet... and sour: The Obamas hand out Halloween sweets to children at the White House in a rare lapse from the First Lady's healthy-eating campaigning. The President jokes about his wife's disapproval of the treats, saying: 'I told her the White House will get egged if we don't'

DECEMBER 10, 2013 Not amused: Stoney-faced Michelle grits her teeth and rolls her eyes skyward as Obama snaps his now infamous 'selfie' with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and David Cameron at Nelson Mandela's memorial

According to a report in the National Enquirer – which plastered ‘Obama Divorce Bombshell!’ across its front page  – the pair have been at loggerheads since last summer and are now sleeping in separate bedrooms.

The ‘final straw’, apparently, was Michelle’s outrage when her husband publicly humiliated her by openly flirting and posing for his now infamous ‘selfie’ photograph with Denmark’s glamorous blonde Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service.

According to published reports, Mrs Obama is only standing by her 52-year-old husband until his presidency ends.

DECEMBER 18, 2013 Oh do shut up dear: Clearly bored, the First Lady listens impassively as her husband defends his healthcare  reforms at a meeting with families inside the Oval Office. One observer says: 'She looked like she'd heard it all before and found it uninteresting. Her body language spoke volumes.'

DECEMBER 21, 2013-JANUARY 4, 2014 Paradise lost: The couple arrive in Hawaii for Christmas but the body language during a basketball game in Honolulu is described as 'frosty'

Distance: The President spent time on the golf course with friends before returning to Washington with daughters Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12. The White House says Mrs Obama stayed behind to mark her birthday with friends including Oprah Winfrey

DECEMBER 25, 2013 Smiling through: The happiness looks fragile as the Obamas embrace the festive season by posing together in front of one of 24 Christmas trees in the White House. They posted this picture on Twitter

JANUARY 16, 2014 Oops, missed: An awkward embrace after a university address about plans to help disadvantaged students attend college. A witness said: 'Barack tried to kiss Michelle on the lips as she came onstage but she turned her cheek.'

He will then return to his home state of Hawaii while she will remain with their daughters in Washington.

The Enquirer is famously well-connected in Washington, and has broken stories which America’s mainstream media chose to ignore, including Democratic presidential contender John Edwards’s secret love child and Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky.

Whether or not the gossip is true, the newly slim First Lady (she credits a vegetarian diet for a recent 10lb weight loss) seems to be soaring in self-confidence, showing off her figure in a succession of form-fitting designer gowns. 

JANUARY 17, 2014 Unhappy birthday: A beaming Michelle celebrates her 50th birthday but her husband¿s plan for a big birthday bash backfired, according to reports, when Michelle refused his wish for a formal dinner and they got into 'a screaming match'

JANUARY 27, 2014 Lonely job: Obama looks tired in the Oval Office preparing his State Of The Union Address last week. His wife later stole the headlines in a spectacular forest-green dress by Azzedine Alaia

At her 50th birthday celebrations she was rarely by her husband’s side, with one guest saying: ‘She was working the room.

She’s looking better than ever and was exuding a sexiness and confidence that wasn’t there before.

‘She’s come into her own. Only time will tell what happens next.’
