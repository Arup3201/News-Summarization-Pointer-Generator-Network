A teenage drug dealer has been arrested for the fifth time on drug charges alongside his pregnant girlfriend who was allegedly smuggling black-tar heroin in her crotch.

Brandon Lee Rumple, 19, and Tasha Nicole Simpson, 25, who is eight-months' pregnant, had been under surveillance in Rowan County, North Carolina.

A special investigations unit had received a tip that Rumple, who was out of jail on more than a $1million in bonds, had been spotted at a known 'heroin distribution point' in Charlotte.

Simpson, 25, who is eight-months' pregnant was charged with trafficking heroin after she was caught in a police sting

When police tried to stop the couple's car on Wednesday, Rumple threw a powdery substance and a plastic bag out of the passenger window, according to arrest reports.

The couple kept driving until they came to the home of Rumple's father Christopher Todd Rumple. Rumple threw a bag to his father while officers attempted to apprehend the suspects.

Christopher Rumple then ran into the house and tried to flush the bag down the toilet.

When officers searched Miss Simpson they found 12 grams of black tar heroin in her crotch area.

Black tar heroin - named for its dark, gooey consistency - is grown in Mexico and Colombia and trafficked into the U.S. It is popular with drug producers as it is easier to produce than pure heroin - but extremely dangerous for users.

Deputies found powder on Brandon Rumple’s face, clothes and in the car. They also recovered a  plastic bag nearby with two grams of a tan powder, which tested positive for MDMA.
