The frontman of the Flaming Lips found himself at the center of a bomb scare after TSA agents found a grenade in his carry-on luggage.

Singer Wayne Coyne, known for his eccentricities, was flying out of Rogers airport in Oklahoma City on November 10 when agents found the device at the security checkpoint.

He told TSA agents that the dead grenade was a gag gift he received at a party and he absentmindedly packed it in his bag.

Apology: Coyne tweeted this photo with the text: 'Sorry Sorry Sorry!! Everyone that was inconvenienced because of my grenade at OKC airport!'

Checkpoint: An anonymous traveller took this shot of Coyne at the TSA checkpoint; the story was first reported by TheLostOgle.com

TMZ, which obtained a copy of the police report, said that the frontman’s slip-up resulted in several flights being missed.

TSA also said that they didn’t have any ‘bomb guys,’ according to the gossip website.

Shortly after the incident, Coyne took to Twitter to voice an apology. ‘Sorry Sorry Sorry!! Everyone that was inconvenienced because of my grenade at OKC airport!!’

A representative for the band did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment.

The singer was apparently flying to Los Angeles by way of LAX to preview the new Flaming Lips musical, entitled ‘Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.’

Mea culpa: Coyne tweeted an apology shortly after the November 10 incident

Shut down: The security debacle caused travelers at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City to miss flights as the TSA temporarily shut down security

Coyne said the dead grenade was given to him as a gag gift, and that he forgot that he had packed it in his bag.

An anonymous traveller told TheLostOgle.com that the security debacle caused him to miss his flight to Las Vegas because he was stuck by the food court.

‘Flight left without me, all because of Wayne Coyne,’ he wrote.

The tipster added bitterly that any late-minute flight would cost him around $500, adding that the singer should have reimbursed all of the travellers stranded by Coyne.
