Esa’s Rosetta mission is currently making its way towards a comet in the solar system.

And, in a series of stunning new images, it reveals how comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has begun to develop into an exciting ball of dust and gas.

Over a period of six weeks the comet has begun to extend its dusty veil known as a ‘coma’ into space.

This sequence of images was taken between 27 March and 4 May, as the gap between spacecraft and comet closed from around 3.1 million miles (five million kilometres) to 1.2 million miles (two million kilometres)

The Rosetta spacecraft is set to rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in August and becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet.

Rosetta,
 named after a block of stone that helped archeologists decipher ancient
 Egyptian hieroglyphs, will seek to help scientists unlock the 
composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and 
evolution of our solar system.

The
 probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five 
times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its 
final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.

For
 the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out 
towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space 
hibernation.

Later
 this year, Rosetta will complete its cruise towards the comet, meeting 
with it in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s 
surface in November.

Once there it will follow the comet on its journey around the sun, performing extensive studies of the coma and the surface.

And in November it will perform another first when it releases the Philae lander, which if successful will be the first vehicle ever to land on a comet.

By the end of the sequence of images of the comet the coma extends about 800 miles (1,300 kilometres).

But the core of the comet, known as the nucleus, is itself just 2.5 miles (four kilometres) across and cannot yet be seen.

The coma has developed as a result of the comet moving progressively closer to the sun along its 6.5 year orbit.

Even though it is still more than 370 million miles (600 million kilometres) from the sun - more than four times the distance between Earth and sun - its surface has already started to warm, causing its ices to turn to gas and escape from its rock-ice nucleus.

As the gas escapes, it also carries a cloud of tiny dust particles out into space, which slowly expands to create the coma.

The warming will continue as the comet moves closer to the sun and activity rises, and pressure from the solar wind will eventually cause some of the material to stream out into a long tail.

Rosetta and the comet will be closest to the sun in August 2015, between the orbits of Earth and Mars.

The Rosetta spacecraft launched in 2004 on a mission to study comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (artist's illustration shown). It will rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in August, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet

In November of this year the Philae lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet (artist's illustration shown), which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet. Here, harpoons will be fired into the surface to keep it anchored while it studies its surroundings

The onset of activity now offers scientists the opportunity to study dust production and structures within the coma before getting much closer.

'It’s beginning to look like a real comet,' says Holger Sierks, principal investigator for OSIRIS, the Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Germany.

'It’s hard to believe that only a few months from now, Rosetta will be deep inside this cloud of dust and en route to the origin of the comet’s activity.'

In addition, tracking the periodic changes in brightness reveals the nucleus is rotating every 12.4 hours ' about 20 minutes shorter than previously thought.

'These early observations are helping us to develop models of the comet that will be essential to help us navigate around it once we get closer,' says Sylvain Lodiot, ESA Rosetta spacecraft operations manager.

On 25 Feb 2007 The Rosetta spacecraft returned this stunning image of Mars as it flew past the red planet on its way to the comet. The picture was taken by an imaging instrument on the Philae lander at a distance of 620 miles (1,000 kilometres). Below the solar array an area close to the Syrtis region is visible on the planet's disk

OSIRIS and the spacecraft’s dedicated navigation cameras have been regularly acquiring images to help determine Rosetta’s exact trajectory relative to the comet.

Using this information, the spacecraft has already started a series of manoeuvres that will slowly bring it in line with the comet before making it enters orbit in the first week of August.

Detailed scientific observations will then help to find the best location on the comet for the Philae lander’s descent to the surface in November.

The images shown here were taken during a six-week period that saw the orbiter’s 11 science experiments and the lander and its 10 instruments switched back on and checked out after more than 2.5 years of hibernation.

Earlier this week, a formal review brought these commissioning activities to a close, giving the official ‘go’ for routine science operations.

'We have a challenging three months ahead of us as we navigate closer to the comet, but after a 10'year journey it’s great to be able to say that our spacecraft is ready to conduct unique science at comet 67P/C-G,' says Fred Jansen, ESA’s Rosetta mission manager.
