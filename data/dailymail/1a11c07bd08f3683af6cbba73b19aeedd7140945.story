Millions of Britain's hard-pressed taxpayers will find themselves up to £705 better off after the coalition today delivered on its flagship tax cut a year early.

Chancellor George Osborne announced that the amount of money that workers can earn before they start paying tax will be raised to £10,000 from April next year.

That will take another 700,000 people out of tax altogether. Ministers had promised to deliver the key Liberal Democrat policy before the 2015 election, but the cut has been rushed forward by a year.

Rising trend: This personal allowance graph taken from figures on the Institute for Fiscal Studies website shows how for a person aged under 65, it has risen from £3,005 to £8,105 from 1990/91 to 2012/13

It is part of a bid to ease the burden on squeezed family budgets and provide an incentive to work. The personal allowance will already increase from £8,105 to £9,400 on April 1.

The announcement means that from April 2014 the average taxpayer will pay £705 less income tax than before the 2010 general election. Ministers boast that the cash is the equivalent of the average gas bill or for two people to pay their council tax bill.

The Lib Dems claim that the move will 
mean 24million taxpayers will have been given an income tax cut since 2010. It 
means a total of 2.7million people will pay no income tax at all.

Is George Osborne's Budget good for Britain?

Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'When times are as tough as they are now, our focus must be on helping those on low and middle incomes.

'The right to earn £10,000 income tax free has gone from the front page of our manifesto to the pockets of 27m hardworking people. By keeping this promise we are giving practical help to millions of families.'

Critics have complained that the money
fails to compensate for other tax rises, including Mr Osborne’s early 
decision to hike VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent.

When the coalition was formed, the 
Tories and Lib Dems pledged to ‘further increase the personal allowance 
to £10,000, making real terms steps each year towards meeting this as a 
longer term policy objective’.

Going up: When the income tax threshold reaches £10,000 in April 2014, the average worker will be £700 better off than in 2010

The Government promised to 
‘prioritise’ the policy over other tax cuts, including the Tory policy 
to cut Inheritance Tax. The tax-free threshold in 2010 was £6,475, 
rising to £7,475 a year later and then £8,105 last year.

Mr Osborne had already announced that 
the threshold is due to rise again to £9,400 in April this year, 12 
months earlier than expected.

The allowance previously only rose in 
line with inflation or rises in wages. Each £100 increase in the 
personal allowance, above inflation, costs the Exchequer £500million.

But free market think thank the Adam 
Smith Institute urged Mr Osborne to lift the allowance to £12,875, which
would ensure full-time minimum wage workers would not have to pay any 
tax.

It said in a report last year that a 
£12,875 personal allowance would increase the take-home pay of all those
earning less than £100,000 by £575 and lift up to 1,297,000 people out 
of the tax system.

The institute’s policy director Sam 
Bowman said: ‘It is a national scandal that we tax the people at the 
bottom of society so much that they can’t earn enough to achieve a basic
standard of living.’

Payments: From April 2014 the average taxpayer will pay £705 less tax than before the 2010 general election

Meanwhile hopes were also pinned on 
the Chancellor easing the strain on savers today as well as building on 
recent signs of confidence returning to the housing market.

Savers have seen the returns on their 
cash squashed by four years of ultra-low interest rates as living costs 
remain high and wages are stagnant.

Almost a dozen tax loopholes will be closed overnight as the government clamps down on those who scrimp on payments to the exchequer.

As the Chancellor strives to plug Britain’s £32bn tax gap, he unveiled ‘the largest ever package to tackle tax evasion’.

The host of measures is expected to bring in £4.6bn to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs’ coffers over the next five years.

Some ten loopholes will be shut down by the government, George Osborne announced.

Tax specialists who concoct artificial avoidance schemes will be ‘named and shamed’ under proposals outlined in the budget.

This is part of the attempts to ‘tackle both the supply and demand of these schemes,’ the document said.

‘A tax system where people and business pay the taxes expected of them is the glue that holds society together,’ the Chancellor declared.

MPs previously lambasted US corporate giants Starbucks, Google and Amazon for scrimping on payments.

Anyone, either a company or individual, who used a tax avoidance scheme in the past will also have to tell the taxman how much they saved by it – and pay it back.

This could raise up to £130m over five years.

One measure will see Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man enter into discussions with the Government over Britons with assets on the islands to settle up with the taxman over past dues.

An estimated £8.5bn of funds are held on the islands by UK residents, and the government hopes to claw back £325m a year by 2016 from the measure.

According to financial information 
website Moneyfacts, the impact of inflation on savings means that 
£10,000 invested five years ago, allowing for average interest and tax 
at 20 per cent, would have the spending power of just £8,884 today.

Former Government policy adviser Ros 
Altmann, who recently stepped down as director-general of Saga, said 
that the rules around tax-free Isas should be relaxed, so that people 
can invest all of their allowance in cash Isas if they want to.

Under the current system, only half of
the £11,280 allowance for this tax year can be saved in cash and the 
remainder must be invested in stocks and shares.

Dr Altmann said: ‘Older people who 
need to live on their savings cannot afford to gamble on the stock 
market, nor can younger generations who are saving for a house deposit.

‘It is important, especially given the
dramatic drop in savings interest rates, that the Government helps 
savers and allows them the choice of whether to invest in cash or other 
assets freely.’

Mr Osborne could also today signal 
that corporation tax will be cut to 20 per cent. He has already slashed 
the headline rate from 28 to 24 per cent and it is due to fall to 23 per
cent next month and 21 per cent in April 2014.

But he is understood to be keen to 
reduce corporation tax to 20 per cent – aligning it with the basic rate 
of income tax and the tax rate on small companies.

It comes as a new study showed the UK 
has enjoyed a jobs ‘boom’ despite the economic downturn and huge 
cutbacks in public spending, despite a fall in labour productivity and a
squeeze on pay.

Leading analyst the Jobs Economist 
said 2012 was the best year for employment growth since 2000, with 
previous jobs booms taking place during periods of a strong economy.

Director Dr John Philpott said: ’2012 
really was a year of extraordinarily strong employment growth. A jobs 
boom without economic growth is unprecedented in recent UK economic 
history.’
