A Washington state sheriff has sent a memo to deputies telling them that sex on duty will not be tolerated.

Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich says he had to spell out the policy because a deputy he fired for the behavior won his job back last month in arbitration.

Scott Kenoyer got his job back in May after an arbitrator found that the consequence was too severe after he admitted to having sex while on duty.

Rules are rules: Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich sent out a memorandum to his deputies stating that sex on duty was not tolerated

Sheriff Knezovich said Kenoyer’s case gave him no choice but forced him to send out a memo making it clear that having sex on duty would not be tolerated.

The memo says that sex on duty is a 
breach of the public trust and a breach of the sheriff's office code of 
ethics, core values and officer safety.

'I never dreamt I'd ever even see such a memo,' Knezovich said to KREM. 'I'm shocked I had to make this statement. Sex on duty is not tolerated, nor is lying.'

Sheriff Knezovich said he didn't want Deputy Kenoyer to get the message that it was okay to have sex whilst on the job.

Mixed work with pleasure: Sheriff¿s Office employees conducted an internal investigation into Deputy Scott Kenoyer's conduct when a woman claimed that she had sex with Kenoyer while he was on duty. He only lasted nine minutes

The memo states that sex on duty is a breach of the public trust and a breach of the Sheriff’s Office code of ethics; core values and officer safety.

'My legal adviser advised that in order to keep this from being a precedent, it had to be very clear,' said Sheriff Knezovich. 

'This agency has established a very firm policy that if you have sex on duty or falsify an official document intentionally, you will be terminated.'

Sheriff’s Office employees conducted an internal investigation into Deputy Kenoyer's conduct when a woman claimed that she had sex with Kenoyer while he was on duty. 

The Sheriff's Office said Kenoyer was only out of service for approximately nine minutes when the sex occurred.
