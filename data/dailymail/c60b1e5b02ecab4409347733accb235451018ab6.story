Hull have asked about Lorient striker Vincent Aboubakar. 

The 22-year-old Cameroon striker scored 16 goals in 36 games last season and is valued at £8million. 

Manager Steve Bruce is moving through targets after being rebuffed in attempts to sign Danny Welbeck, Troy Deeney and Steven Fletcher.

Fourth time lucky? Hull are chasing Vincent Aboubakar after being snubbed by series of strikers

The Tigers have money to spend following the £12 million sale of striker Shane Long to Southampton, with Bruce insisting the proceeds will be reinvested in the squad. 

Saints alive: Hull need a replacement for Shane Long following his £12m sale to Southampton

'We got what, in our opinion, was a fabulous offer,' said Bruce. 'It happened so quickly. This time last week I would never have envisaged us being without him.'

'We will invest that money into the squad to make it bigger and better, and we'll be looking to find a replacement,' Bruce added.
