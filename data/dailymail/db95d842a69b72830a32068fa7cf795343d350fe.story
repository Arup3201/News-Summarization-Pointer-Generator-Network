When the Duchess of Cambridge was 
pictured with unflattering streaks of grey last week, it was a marked 
contrast with her normally immaculate look.

It was also a clue to the trendy colouring technique that attracted attention at Prince George’s christening.

Today, The
Mail on Sunday has revealed that she has been having a £350 colouring 
treatment known as balayage – a technique that involves ‘painting’ the 
hair with ammonia-free dye to give a natural look.

It is popular with celebrities including Kate Moss and Sienna Miller.

But,
as last week’s pictures make clear, balayage colour can fade quickly on
brunettes – and Kate has already summoned her hairdresser for a 
touch-up.

The trend was invented in France in the 1970s - although it didn't take off in Britain until 2008.

Translating as 'to sweep', the free-hand strokes of bleach painted onto a woman's hair is designed to give a style of movement that block colour cannot.

It was originally only done for blondes, whose hair is more sensitive to the dye and more readily shows the effects.

But as demand soared, stylists worked to develop different techniques which work for brown hair.

As pictures of Kate captured this week, brunettes are still resilient to bleach as dark hair takes longer to react.

And
balayage, designed for natural hair, is not the ideal way to cover 
already existing roots. Kate has been topping up her chocolate brown 
locks for years.

Impeccably 
placed sources have whispered that the Duchess had, to her then horror, 
started finding the odd stray grey (‘stress highlights’, her friends 
joke) before her pregnancy.

When the technique crept onto catwalks
five years ago, beauty blogs and fashion magazines lauded it as 'the 
working woman's dream'.

It is low maintenance, deliberately uneven, and lasts longer.

After three appointments, only a toner and freshener is required, rather than the full treatment.

Compared
to normal dye, when balayage grows out there is not a clear line of 
roots, meaning women can be more flexible with their appointments.

To combat these, she had organic vegetable-based dye and subtle low-lights applied during regular four-hour visits to the Richard Ward Hair And Metrospa in Chelsea.

Evidently, Kate has let these sessions slip - not many new mothers, even royal ones, can spare four hours at the salon when they've got a four-month-old to look after.

'Going grey marks nature’s way of softening the hair colour giving natural highlights as the skin pigmentation changes,' says Galvin Jr.

'I always recommend using a semi-permanent colour with no ammonia or peroxide, to blend the grey hair and tone it down slightly.'

However, Kate may want to avoid any unnecessary chemicals: it could be that she's being very cautious about dying her hair while pregnant or breastfeeding.

Many women stop colouring their hair during pregnancy, with some waiting until at least 12 weeks after the birth of their baby to begin again.

This is for fear of the chemicals used in many dyes being passed to the baby through breast-feeding.
