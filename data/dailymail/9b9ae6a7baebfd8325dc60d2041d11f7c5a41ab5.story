Ruthless Chelsea extended Tottenham's torment at Stamford Bridge with a 3-0 win which saw Jose Mourinho's unbeaten Blues consolidate their lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League.

Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel rated the players' performances at Stamford Bridge. 

CHELSEA (4-2-3-1)

Thibault Courtois - 6.5

Had to keep his wits about him as Spurs started quickly, but was a spectator for the most part. 6.5

Branislav Ivanovic - 6.5

As always, what you see is what you get. Solid in defence and joined in to bolster numbers in attack.

John Terry - 7

The Chelsea captain has clearly not lost his enthusiasm on derby day. As combative and determined as ever.

Gary Cahill - 6

Recovered well after a nasty head collision with Jan Vertonghen, but had to be replaced at half-time.

Cesar Azpilicueta - 6.5

Lennon's pace caused him a few problems, but on the whole dealt well with the Tottenham winger.

Nemanja Matic - 7

Provides the base for Chelsea's forwards to cause havoc. Is there a better defensive minded midfielder in England?

Cesc Fabregas - 7

Had extra incentive  given his links with Arsenal. The Spaniard helped Chelsea take full control of midfield.

Willian - 6.5

Relentless work rate from the Brazil international. As important defensively as he was in the attacking third.

Oscar - 7

Brilliant pass to set-up Drogba's first-half goal. Spurs struggled to deal with his intelligent movement in front of their back-four.

Eden Hazard - 7.5

Knew he had the beating of Chiriches and took full advantage, giving the Romanian a night he'll want to forget.

Nemanja Matic produced another influential performance in the Chelsea engine room

Didier Drogba - 8

This Drog doesn't need new tricks, the old ones are still working fine. An utterly ruthless display from the Blues legend.

Subs

Zouma 6 (for Cahill, 46); Remy 7 (for Drogba, 67)

Not used: Cech, Luis, Zouma, Schurrle, Salah, Remy

Manager 

Jose Mourinho - 7

His side were rattled during the opening exchanges, but they rarely looked in any serious trouble.

TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1)

Hugo Lloris - 5

Will be disappointed to have let Hazard's strike in at the near post. His side's positive start went to pot from that moment.

Vlad Chiriches - 4.5

Hazard had him on toast. You almost felt sorry for the defender at times. Not a right back…and it certainly showed.

Federico Fazio - 5.5

The jury's still out on the central defender. Looked solid one minute and error-prone the next.

Jan Vertonghen - 5.5

Doesn't look anywhere near the player he was during his first two seasons at Tottenham.

Ben Davies - 6

Had his hands full in trying to deal with Willian's energy and his quality in possession suffered as a result.

Ryan Mason - 5.5

Did his best against Fabregas and Matic, but was no match for Chelsea's formidable midfield duo.

Nabil Bentaleb - 6.5

The youngster will be better for this experience. Kept a cool head in midfield and was economical in possession.

Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentaleb kept a cool head under pressure

Aaron Lennon - 6

Seems to be back in favour with Pochettino and caused problems down Chelsea's left-hand side before being subbed.

Christian Eriksen - 6

Schemed and probed for an opening but couldn't get on the ball enough to cause Chelsea major problems.

Erik Lamela - 6

Saw plenty of the ball, but once more flattered to deceive for Tottenham. When will Pochettino run out of patience?

Harry Kane - 7

Spurs' biggest threat on a disappointing night. Unlucky with a header that hit the bar in the first half.

Subs

Chadli 5 (for Lennon, 58); Paulinho 5 (on for Mason, 58); Soldado (on for Lamela, 74)

Not used: Vorm, Kaboul, Dier, Naughton

Manager 

Mauricio Pochettino - 6 

Would have been encouraged by his side's start but then watched his side self-destruct in three minutes. 

Ref: Mike Dean - 6.5

Kept a cool head on fiery night at Stamford Bridge. Didn't once look like he was close to losing control of this London derby

Midfielder Eden Hazard was also in fine form and scored 7.5
