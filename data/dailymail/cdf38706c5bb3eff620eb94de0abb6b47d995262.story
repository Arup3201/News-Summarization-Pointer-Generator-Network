The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are fans of the drama, and it is thought Miss Ogilvy’s appearance will encourage other royals to tune in.

A Downton Abbey insider said: ‘There’s a lot of excitement among the royals and they will almost certainly be watching the new  series now.

‘Everyone’s really proud of Flora for bagging a role in such a big show at such a young age and for doing it off her own back.’

Insiders have said it is hoped that Miss Ogilvy’s involvement will be even more of an appeal to the show’s fan base in the US.

She is said to have made a good impression on the set.

Miss Ogilvy filmed the series while on her gap year. She finished at £30,000-a-year Rugby school last spring, and is set to start at St Andrew’s University in September.

Her parents James, who is the Queen's Godson, and Julia met at the university in a similar way to William and Kate.

A source close to Flora said: ‘It will be a really exciting time for her to be starting uni and have her TV debut within weeks of each other.

'She really wants to do more acting so she’s hoping her part in Downton makes a big impression.’

Downton had more than 11 million viewers for its Christmas special as has been sold to 100 countries across the globe.

The show which is on its fourth series, is filmed at Highclere Castle in Hampshire.
