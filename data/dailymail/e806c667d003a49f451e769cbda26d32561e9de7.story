Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said he would scrap the married tax allowance after the election

Labour will scrap the Conservatives’ ‘perverse and unfair’ new £1,000 transferable tax allowance for married couples, Ed Balls announced last night.

The shadow Chancellor said a Labour government would reverse the Government’s proposal to restore recognition for the institution in the tax system, and spend the money to help fund a reintroduction of the 10p tax rate.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, the staunchest champion of marriage in the Cabinet, condemned the announcement.

‘Labour scrapped support for marriage when they were last in government - penalising stable families,’ Mr Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail.

‘And here they go again - same old Labour - with yet another example of making decent people pay more in taxes.

‘Conservatives support marriage because it is a vital institution which underpins stable families. We support strong relationships, which we know offer children the best start in life.’

Married couples where one person earns under the £10,000 income tax threshold will be allowed to transfer £1,000 of their allowance to their spouse – reducing their annual tax bill by £200 from April 2015.

Only the 24 million basic rate taxpayers will benefit, though David Cameron has signalled he wants to go further if re-elected with a Conservative majority.

Polls show overwhelming support for the new allowance, though it is opposed by both Labour and the Liberal Democrats. A recent YouGov poll found that 62 per cent of people back the idea, with just 20 per cent against.

Mr Balls told the BBC last night that the tax break would only benefit a third of married couples, and one in six families with children, and declared he would scrap it if he is chancellor after the 2015 election.

Assessing Mr Osborne's tax policies ahead of next week's Budget he said: ‘Personally, I think that first of all, George Osborne should first of all admit the 50p tax cut at the top was a big mistake.

‘But I also think, any tax cut for families on middle and low incomes is better than none.

'What did he actually announce last year, he said that he would introduce a married couples allowance which, when you look at the detail, only goes to a third of married couples, and one in six families with children, it goes mainly to men.'

Downing Street was under mounting pressure last night to ease the 40p tax burden on the middle classes.

The
 Chancellor is expected to reject calls for a significant increase to 
the threshold in next week’s Budget, after figures showed millions more 
are being sucked into the higher rate tax.

But they are facing growing demands 
to help the 1.4million workers who have been sucked into the 40p band 
since 2010, with MPs arguing many of these people are on middling 
incomes.

Official figures show that the top 25
 per cent of earners – anyone on £33,717 or more – will pay 75 per cent 
of the country’s total £167billion of income tax this year.

By contrast, the bottom half will pay less than 10 per cent.

When the Coalition came to power in May 2010 the starting salary for higher rate tax stood at just £43,875.

If
 George Osborne had allowed the 40p tax band to rise in line with 
inflation it would now not kick in until a worker reached a salary of 
£50,000, according to calculations by accountants Grant Thornton.

Mr Balls went on: ‘We think what we should actually do is scrap the married couples allowance which is perverse and unfair, and use that money to give a tax cut for all middle and lower income families.

‘We propose a new 10p starting rate of income tax. It's better than the personal allowance, because it's better for work incentives, it would help two-thirds of married couples, it would help women as well as men, families with children.

‘Let's cut taxes for working families, and let's ease this cost-of-living crisis rather than carrying on pandering to Tory backbenchers with tax cuts that are unfair and don't make sense.’

The shadow chancellor also admitted being ‘daunted’ by the prospect of being in Number 11 after the election with further efforts to cut the deficit necessary.

Asked how he would respond to the Tory charge that voters should not ‘give the keys back to the guy who crashed the car’, Mr Balls added: ‘All of us in our lives get things right, but all of us make some mistakes, and the last Labour government didn't regulate the financial services in a tough enough way.

‘But we've learnt from that and we'll come in not just with experience, not just some wisdom which comes from that experience, but with utter determination to make this country fairer and stronger for the future.’

A Government source said scrapping the marriage tax allowance would save under £500 million a year, a fraction of the £2 billion a year cost of introducing a new 10p tax band covering the first £1,000 of earnings.

‘Once again Ed Balls’ sums simply don’t add up. His latest gimmick would mean £1.5 billion more spending, more borrowing and more taxes to pay for it,’ the source said. ‘Nothing changes – it’s the same old Labour with no long-term economic plan to secure a better future for Britain.’

Labour has previously suggested it would also use the proceeds of a new mansion tax on properties worth £2 million or more to fund a 10p rate. Gordon Brown scrapped the 10p rate in his last Budget, and all those who used to pay it now pay no tax at all because of the coalition’s new £10,000 tax threshold.
