The England World Cup squad set off for their first training session since arriving in Brazil today - followed by trucks full of soldiers.

The team made their way from their beachfront hotel in Rio de Janeiro to their World Cup training base under the watchful eye of the Brazilian Army Police.

A line of troops with shields stood by the coach as the players left the hotel for the first training session. The coach was then followed by trucks full of soldiers as it made its way to the training camp.

Ross Barkley had to sprint to catch up with the coach after it set off without him

The morning was not all planned with military-style precision however as Ross Barkley nearly missed the bus.

The 20-year-old found himself running late for the 9.45am meeting time, and the coach set off without him.

But
 they realised almost immediately and stopped for 15 minutes. Barkley 
managed to sprint, catch up and climb aboard, where he was met by a 
hearty round of applause from his squad-mates.

The team then held their first session at the Urca military base in Rio  this afternoon - 24 hours after they landed in Brazil for the final leg of their World Cup preparations.

A samba band made up of 20 children from local Sport Relief funded project Bola Pra Frente greeted the squad as they came out to train in the near 30-degree heat.

Manager Roy Hodgson and his players then held up a banner while the band played which read: 'Obrigado Brasil pela recepcao calorosa', meaning 'Thank you Brazil for the warm welcome'.

The line of troops – some carrying
 riot shields, semi-automatic weapons and pistols – stood at the front 
of the Royal Tulip hotel in the Sao Conrado district of the city.

The ‘ring of steel’ provided by the 
authorities was ordered after a bus carrying Brazil’s national team was 
attacked two weeks ago in the city by a 200 strong mob of angry teachers
 protesting at the rising costs of hosting the 2014 World Cup.

During
 England’s stay at the 418 room and 17 floor hotel the ‘Three Lions’ 
contingent will occupy two floors of the building with security provided
 by both the FA and the Brazilian authorities.
