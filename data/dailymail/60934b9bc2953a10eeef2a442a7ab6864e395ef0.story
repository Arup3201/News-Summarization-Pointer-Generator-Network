The deaths of Colin McRae and three others in a helicopter crash were caused by the former world rallying champion's 'imprudent' flying, a sheriff has ruled.

McRae, 39, his five-year-old son Johnny, the boy's friend Ben Porcelli, six, and Graeme Duncan, 37, all died when the aircraft came down near McRae's home in Lanark on September 15, 2007.

Sheriff Nikola Stewart concluded that the deaths could have been avoided if McRae had not engaged in low-level flying 'when it was unnecessary and unsafe to do so'.

The deaths of former world rallying champion Colin McRae and three others in a helicopter crash could have been avoided, a sheriff has ruled.

However, McRae's father Jimmy said the family believe they will never know what caused the crash and said they were never in any doubt of Colin's 'prowess as a fine pilot'.

In her written determination issued today at the end of the 12-day inquiry, the sheriff concluded: 'The deaths and the accident resulting in the deaths might have been avoided had Mr McRae not flown his helicopter into the Mouse Valley.

'Such a precaution would have been entirely reasonable. There was no necessity to enter the Mouse Valley. There were no operational or logistical reasons to enter the Mouse Valley.

'Mr McRae chose to fly the helicopter into the valley. For a private pilot such as Mr McRae, lacking the necessary training, experience or requirement to do so, embarking upon such demanding, low-level flying in such difficult terrain, was imprudent, unreasonable and contrary to the principles of good airmanship.'

As part of the hearing, the sheriff and lawyers involved in the case visited the woods near McRae's Jerviswood House home where the Eurocopter Squirrel aircraft crashed, as he flew home from a trip to see a friend.

One of the crash victims, Mr Duncan, filmed much of the outbound and return flights on his personal camcorder and some of the footage was recovered and included in the inquiry hearings.

Sheriff Stewart said the footage indicated that the helicopter was being flown 'imprudently' and 'without due regard to the principles of good airmanship'.

She wrote: 'The video recording provides detailed information as to the manner in which Mr McRae piloted G-CBHL that day.

'He consistently flew the helicopter at unnecessarily low heights. He clearly breached the 500-feet minimum separation requirement on at least one occasion when he detoured to fly at 275 feet over farm buildings, and may well have done so on others.

'He undertook significant manoeuvring at low level and the helicopter seems to have encountered significant g-loading as a result, to the evident enjoyment of his passengers.

'The episodes of extremely low-level 
flying and the excessive manoeuvre parameters, particularly the descent 
into the valley by Larkhall, all as captured on the video recording, are
indicative of an aircraft being flown imprudently, without due regard 
to the principles of good airmanship and in such a way that normal 
safety margins would be reduced.'

The report stated that the video 
recording ended about 55 seconds flying time from the accident site and 
prior to the entry to Mouse Valley.

Sheriff Stewart added: 'At that time,
Mr McRae appears to be relaxed and in control of the aircraft, which 
seems to be operating satisfactorily.

'The manner in which he handles the aircraft suggests he continues to have no concerns about its serviceability.'

To fly an aircraft in the UK, it is 
necessary to hold a pilot's licence and a valid medical certificate, and
to have the licence validated with the type of aircraft to be flown.

Jimmy McRae, Mr McRae's father, said he hoped the family would be able to 'move forward' following the findings.

Sheriff Stewart found McRae did not hold a valid flying licence or a valid 'rating' for the Eurocopter Squirrel helicopter.

'He was, accordingly, in breach of 
article 26 of the Air Navigation Order 2005 when he flew his helicopter 
on September 15 2007 and should not have flown that machine at that 
time,' she said.

Jimmy McRae, the rally driver's father, said he hoped the family would be able to 'move forward' following the findings.

He said: 'The past four years have been extremely difficult for all the families concerned and we hope that now we can move forward.

'We still believe we will never know what caused the crash but we were never in any doubt as to Colin's prowess as a fine pilot.

'Everybody knows from Colin's rallying career that safety is always an issue and that his reactions and eye and hand co-ordination were world-class.'

He said his family had wanted a finding that private aircraft should be fitted with a flight data recorder.

He said: 'Had a flight recorder been fitted to the aircraft, it may have been possible to determine what occurred in the final seconds of the flight and what actually caused the helicopter to crash.

'This would prevent uncertainty as to the cause of the crash and allow lessons to be learned from tragic accidents such as this.'

The McRae family's solicitor, Peter Watson, said: 'Although Colin's licence was out-of-date, this played no contributory factor whatsoever to the accident.'
