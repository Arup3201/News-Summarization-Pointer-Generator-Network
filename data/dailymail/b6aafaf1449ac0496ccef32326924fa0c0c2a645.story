It's proving to be a bitter and ugly custody battle between Halle Berry and her ex Gabriel Aubry over their daughter Nahla.

And according to reports today, the former couple have been told they should take parenting classes together to see how their war is affecting their three-year-old girl.

Halle, 45, and 36-year-old Gabriel, were in court today, have been recommended to take the classes by the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services.

Strained relations: Halle and Gabriel have apparently been advised to attend parenting classes by the authorities in a bid to iron out their difficulties for the sake of their daughter

Halle was pictured arriving at Los Angeles Superior Court this morning.

A source told RadarOnline today that 
the classes were recommended to the estranged pair in the hope that they
will see how their fighting is affecting their daughter.

The
source said: 'The report recommends that Halle and Gabriel attend 
parenting classes together, so that they can co-parent Nahla together. 
The classes will give them the tools to work through their issues, and 
hopefully become better parents for it.'

It was also reported yesterday, on TMZ, that Aubry has 'agreed to take anger management 
classes' following an incident where he is alleged to have 'pushed' his 
daughter's nanny.

The website also reported that the couple have been requested to attend mediated sessions, in which they would be accompanied by a third party as they decided how to best raise their child, which apparently Halle was receptive to, although Gabriel was not.

And the US website also report that the DCFSe have recommended counselling for Nahla.

According
to TMZ, the 36-year-old male model and his former girlfriend spent 
hours yesterday with representatives from the Los Angeles County 
Department of Children and Family Services.

It is claimed by sources that social workers concluded Aubry 'needed to work on his anger issues.'

A law enforcement source connected with the case told the website: 
'Gabriel has a little bit of a temper, but the good news is that he 
realises it.'

The recommendation stems from an incident earlier this month in which 
Gabriel allegedly pushed the nanny while she was holding three-year-old 
Nahla. 

Halle was advised to seek 
professional help after the nanny claimed Gabriel screams at the child 
and violently yanked Nahla from her arms.

In turn, Gabriel is asking for a restraining order as he believes she's inventing lies to side with Halle.

Today in court it is said that Halle has asked for Aubry to have only just supervised visits with Nahla, according to Radaronline.com.

'Halle is asking the judge to order 
monitored visitation for the entire time that Nahla is with Gabriel 
pending the outcome of the criminal investigation,'  a source told the website.

'Currently, the nanny, under terms of the current custody agreement is 
with both parents from 12:30 p.m. until Nahla goes to sleep.

'Halle 
doesn't want Nahla alone with Gabriel at all right now, period. Gabriel 
is absolutely opposed to monitored visitation because he feels he has 
done nothing wrong.'

It has also been reported that Gabriel wanted to meet with the LAPD to clear his name.

'Gabe was more than willing to meet with law enforcement, he has nothing to hide. He was under NO obligation to meet with cops, but recognized this was something he needed to do to erase this cloud of suspicion that has been lingering over him,' a source told Radar.

'He is hopeful that criminal charges won't be filed against him.

While Gabriel is still under investigation for child endangerment and battery, many insiders believe that he won't be charged.

Berry is reportedly paying her ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry's legal fees in connection with their ongoing custody dispute.

'Halle has been ordered by the judge 
to pay Gabriel's legal fees. It's not uncommon in custody dispute cases 
when the parents aren't married, to have the person that earns more 
money, pay for the other side’s legal bills.

'It's so that both sides will have a 
level playing field, and fees in custody disputes are racked up very 
quickly,' a source told Radar.

Meanwhile, Nahla was oblivious to the drama as she enjoyed a day at the beach on the weekend with her mother's beau Olivier Martinez.

The 46-year-old French actor showed off his paternal side as he watched the three-year-old playing.

Halle's cast may be a continued pain 
in the leg for the 45-year-old actress, but for her daughter Nahla it 
has clearly provided hours of entertainment.

Oscar winning star hobbled into a West Hollywood French restaurant for 
lunch this morning, displaying some colourful art work on her cast.

Halle broke her foot while filming movie Cloud Atlas in Spain last September, but the break in her left foot recently reoccurred, leaving her in the plaster cast and crutches.
