A mother who police said was trying to avoid a fourth drink-driving offence was arrested after she was seen running beside a major motorway with her nine-month-old baby in a carrier, officials said.

Kimberly Schumacher, 27, was taken into custody by a state trooper after she was spotted with her child next to the Interstate 94 near DeForest, Wisconsin, on Wednesday, police said in a statement.

The Janesville woman was taken into custody by a Wisconsin State Patrol trooper who found her not far from her car with a strong smell of alcohol on her breath, the state patrol said.

Her baby was not injured and was turned over to the father, the statement added.

Wisconsin state trooper Jana Schmudlach went to the scene along eastbound I-39/90/94 near DeForest after getting a call about a woman running along the highway, officers said.

'The baby had already been secured inside of an ambulance that had stopped to check on their welfare,' the release said.

'They were coming back from a call, ended up passing her and stopped to check on her,' Ms Schmudlach said.

Ms Schumacher had returned to her pickup truck about 500 feet from the ambulance by the time Ms Schmudlach arrived.

It wasn't clear why Ms Schumacher had stopped her pickup along the Interstate, but she admitted she had been driving, Ms Schmudlach added.

Ms Schumacher failed a drink-driving test and was arrested and booked into the Dane County Jail. Her child was released to its father, who drove away in the pickup truck.

A Wisconsin state trooper said Ms Schumacher's baby was unharmed and the girl's father later left with her

The woman was expected to be charged in Dane County Circuit Court with driving a car while drunk with a child under age 16.

In June, a British mother was nearly three times the drink drive limit when she was pulled over by police in Poole, Dorset, with her baby on the passenger seat.

Deborah Anne Poulton, 38, was taken into custody by officers after a driver saw her Fiat Seicento weaving dangerously across the road, mounting the kerb and almost colliding with a cyclist.

When the police pulled her over in Wroxham Road, they discovered Ms Poulton was with her 13-month-old daughter in the car , Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court heard.

Ms Poulton admitted drink-driving, with a reading of 103 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath.
