A New York City police officer has been arrested in India in an alleged act of retribution for the scandal late last year involving an Indian diplomat and her nanny in Manhattan.

Manny Encarnacion was arrested at the international airport in New Delhi after authorities charged him with violating the Arms Act of 1959 because he had three bullets in his jacket pocket.

The specifics of how he allegedly broke the law remain unclear but a comment made by one of the arresting officers suggests that it had more to do with the treatment of the Indian diplomat, Deyani Khobragade, than anything else.

Trumped up: Manny Encarnacion has been charged with violating an Indian Arms deal because airport officials found three bullets in the NYPD officer's jacket pocket

'You guys like to strip-search our diplomats,' said one of the Indian police officers allegedly, according to The New York Post.

The
 dig is a clear reference to the uproar that was caused when Ms 
Khobragade was searched by the NYPD after she was arrested for keeping 
her nanny in virtual servitude with very little pay in December.

Ms
 Khobragade was the deputy counsul general for the Indian consulate 
general of India in New York at the time and it led to an international 
standoff between the two countries.

She left the United States on January 
9th after taking the State Department's offer of immunity that comes 
with a diplomatic visa, but the case didn't end there.

A district court judge in Washington 
ruled on March 12 that all charges be dropped because of the diplomatic 
status but just two days later, she was re-indicted on the same charges.

That was around the same time that Mr Encarnacion was taken into custody by Indian police.

The 49-year-old officer was traveling to India to visit his wife Vida who is a student living in Iran. 

When
 he was going through a security screening at the airport, they found 
three bullets in his jacket pocket that he had accidentally left there 
from when he was at a shooting range doing his required NYPD 
recertification days before his trip.

'He knows he didn’t do anything wrong... It's an innocent mistake,' Mr Encarnacion's friend Raul Borbon told The New York Post.

New York Police Department Deputy Chief Kim Royster said the department was working with the State Department to try to get the charges dropped so Encarnacion could return to the United States.

Congressman Peter King wrote a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday to look into the situation.

The New York Republican called the 
arrest 'an excessive act by the Indian government' and suggested it was 
payback for last year's arrest and strip-search of an Indian consular 
official for alleged visa fraud in New York.

State
 Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said she was aware of the reports of 
the officer's arrest but declined to comment on the specifics of the 
case because of privacy concerns.

Asked
 whether the United States is worried whether Americans are potential 
targets for retribution because of how the Indian diplomat was treated 
in New York, she responded, 'I think we feel like we've moved past this 
and hope the Indians have as well. ... India is a very close partner.'

Mr Encarnacion has worked for the NYPD for more than 10 years after leaving the Marines and is up for a promotion to the level of detective.

The trip, which was initially supposed to last for only two and a half weeks, is now threatening his job because he will be stuck in India for five weeks- assuming everything goes in his favor at his April 19 court appearance.

'He’s out on ($1,000) bail...He’s not sweating it that much because at least he gets to spend time with his wife,' Mr Borbon said.
