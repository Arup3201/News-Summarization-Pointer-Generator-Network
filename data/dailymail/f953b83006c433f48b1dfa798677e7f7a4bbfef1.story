West Ham co-owner David Sullivan was confronted by angry fans outside The Hawthorns after the Hammers' 4-0 FA Cup defeat to West Bromwich Albion.

Shocking footage shows Sullivan responding to abuse from a group of supporters after he left the ground before full-time after what he describes as West Ham's 'worst performance of the season'.

The fans are heard abusing and swearing at the club's co-owner and urging him to sack  manager Sam Allardyce.

Despite an impressive campaign that currently places them eighth in the Barclays Premier League, West Ham fans chanted against Allardyce at The Hawthorns on Saturday as a Brown Ideye brace and goals from James Morrison and Saido Berahino condemned them to an FA Cup fifth-round exit.

As he attempted to leave a car park close to the ground, Sullivan was approached by a group of fans and responds to their opinions in the video footage by asking: 'who else is going to take over?'

One supporter repeatedly asks Sullivan: 'Why are you leaving early?' before adding: 'I've got to travel back on the f***ing train, not a f***ing Rolls Royce or a f***ing plane.'

Sam Allardyce has had a good season at West Ham but their supporters are not happy with him

Sullivan says: 'I've never left early all season. That was was the worst performance all season.'

One supporter asks for 'answers' from the co-owner, while another shouts abuse about Allardyce.

The confrontation ends with some fans praising Sullivan by shouting 'fair play David' while another shouts 'you're a c***'.

The east Londoners have also received dozens of emails from fans, reacting furiously to a minority who reacted so angrily to the Cup defeat. 

Fans have apologised for the behaviour and back Sullivan to continue taking the club forward.

West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady was also referred to by one supporter in the argument

A source close Sullivan told Sportsmail: ‘He never leaves and considers it his duty to stay, but he was crestfallen by the performance and had seen enough. At 4-0 down and down to ten men, he couldn’t face all the glad-handing in the boardroom after the game.

‘He was happy to talk to the supporters, as he always is, and he understand emotions were running high, but they became aggressive and abusive.

‘David remains as committed to West Ham as ever and wants the club to continue to make progress. He was bitterly disappointed with what he called "the worst performance of the season", but the club are eighth in the Premier League and he is demanding a big finish to what has been a good season.’ 

On Monday evening, Sullivan's son Jack took to Twitter to defend his father and said: 'Just seen the video of my dad getting abused.

'Firstly, I would like to say that I think it is terrible how disrespectful some of the fans are towards owners who arguably saved WHU and don't think that my dad deserves this treatment at all.

'Secondly, as none of you will know my Dad's Mum is very ill in hospital and he was going to visit her, I think many people do not think We have anything going on in our lives, it's not just West Ham.'

Fan voice 1: It's not your fault, it's not your fault.

Fan voice 2: Don't talk to me, I'm a season-ticket holder.

Sullivan: Who else is going to take over?

Fan voice 2: I'm a season-ticket holder, don't talk to me like that.

Why are you leaving early? Why are you f***ing leaving early?

Fan voice 3: Why are you f***ing off early?

Sullivan: Why are you?

Fan voice 2: Because I've got to travel back on the f***ing train, not a f***ing Rolls Royce or a f***ing plane. We're fans.

Sullivan: Look, I'm a fan. I've never left early all season. That was the worst performance all season.

Fan voice 2: Can you give us something back though? 

Fan voice 2: Can we just forget it and instead of palming it all off can we have some answers?

Sullivan: I'll shake your hand, shake your hand, shake your hand.

Fan voice 5: I've been a West Ham supporter for 40 f***ing years. Why aren't you f***ing doing something?

Fan voice 2: Can we have some answers? 

Fan voice 2: Can we have some answers please?

Sullivan: That's not big and it's not clever.

Fan voice 6: That's not funny.

Fan voice 2: Can we have some answers? Proper answers, not on Twitter, not on Twitter.

Fan voice 7: Listen mate, we was up at four o'clock this morning...

Fan voice 8: Get Big Sam out!

Fan voice 9: Sam out!

Fan voice 7: We got caught in a crash on the motorway, someone died, someone died, and we got here 25 minutes gone, and we're leaving 25 minutes to go. We've had it with him.

Sullivan: I've never left early.

Fan voice 7: We've had it with him.

Sullivan: All season it was the worst performance.

Fan voice 10: Fair play to you, fair play to you.

Fan voice 11: West Brom, they're going down mate.

Fan voice 12: Fair play David!

Fan voice 13: Fair play!
