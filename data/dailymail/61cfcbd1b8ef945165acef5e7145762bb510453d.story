It's a coming together of two of the biggest, and arguably most controversial, names in Australian political history with Clive Palmer turning to the son of a Queensland parliamentary icon to revive his party's flagging influence, ahead of next year's state election.

The Palmer United Party (PUP) announced that John Bjelke-Petersen, the son of former long-time premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, will lead the Queensland arm of the party to the 2015 election.

Clive Palmer is hoping the appointment will help turn around flagging fortunes of his embattled party, which has been beset by internal wrangling, particularly on a federal level, in recent months.

The PUP had been without a state leader in Queensland since October after its two sitting MPs, Alex Douglas and Carl Judge, quit the party.

'Campbell Newman and his government have failed Queensland and Queenslanders,' Mr Bjelke-Petersen said.

'It is time that Queenslanders were represented by a government focused on building the state's economy, creating jobs and providing opportunities for local industries.'

Mr Palmer will be hoping Mr Bjelke-Petersen can turn around the fortunes of the Queensland arm of his party following the embarrassing defections by Dr Douglas and Mr Judge.

Dr Douglas, the Queensland PUP's inaugural leader, quit in August citing concerns over the way candidates were being selected in what he termed an 'old boy's club'.

Yeerongpilly MP Mr Judge only lasted two months as state leader before also leaving the party in October, saying he felt he could better serve his constituents as an independent.

Mr Palmer had previously said he was seeking a 'strong character' to lead his party in Queensland and believed Mr Bjelke-Petersen was the best man for the job.

'Mr Bjelke-Petersen is just the person the party needs, he is a real leader who will be able to deliver real results for all Queenslanders,' he said in a statement.

Mr Bjelke-Petersen's father, Sir Joh, was Queensland's longest-serving premier, holding office from 1968 to 1987.

Mr Palmer served as the campaign director of the National Party when Joh Bjelke-Petersen was returned as Queensland premier in 1983 and 1986 and it's widely thought that Sir Joh's politics also influenced the mining magnate.

Sir Joh's time in office was considered highly controversial and ended in shame, with state ministers and Queensland's police commissioner jailed for corruption offences after the high-profile Fitzgerald Inquiry into police corruption.

Mr Bjelke-Petersen quit the Liberal National Party in 2013 citing his disgust at a perceived lack of support by the Newman Government for regional Queensland.

Thousands of mourners packed the small south-east Queensland town to pay tribute to one of Australia's most controversial political leaders and the state's longest serving premier, who died at the age of 94.

He then stood in the 2013 federal election for Mr Palmer in the seat of Maranoa, claiming more than 13 per cent of the primary vote, ultimately losing out to LNP MP Bruce Scott.

His appointment as leader comes a month after it was announced he'll stand against incumbent and Queensland deputy premier Jeff Seeney in the seat of Callide at the upcoming state election.

It's been a few months of dissent among the ranks and major dilemmas for Clive Palmer.

Among them, his media adviser appearing in court over the alleged kidnapping of a bank boss, the defection of outspoken Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie and allegations he used Chinese government money to fund his political campaign.
