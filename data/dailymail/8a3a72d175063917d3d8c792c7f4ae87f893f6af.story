A man has accused an airline of kicking him off a flight because he was too big.

Matthew Harper, 34, was due to travel on a Southwest Airlines plane from Chicago to Denver when he claims an official demanded he leave the flight.

The Texas resident, who weighs 340lb, claims he was removed from the flight in front of other passengers waiting to board and told the flight was overbooked.

Speaking to KDVR.com, he said he 'felt like a criminal' when told the leave the flight on Sunday.

He added: 'I’m 34 years old, and I’ve never been humiliated like this in my life. I mean, when I got back on the plane, the only thing I could do was put my head down.' 

Mr Harper claims that he was asked by an airline official whether he was aware of its policy for larger customers.

According to Fox News.com, this encourages overweight passengers to buy an extra seat.

However, Mr Harper claims there was an unoccupied seat between himself  and his brother.

Following discussions,  Mr Harper was allowed back on the plane.

After filing a complaint with the airline, he was offered $100. However, he has turned this down and is now planning to hire an attorney.

A spokesman for Southwest said the company plans to talk to Mr Harper to discuss what happened.
