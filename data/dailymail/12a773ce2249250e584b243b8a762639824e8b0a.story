When you think of you think of your typical fitness instructor you can't help but picture a super-slim Lycra wearing gym bunny. 

But Charlotte Clarke, 38, who runs an aerobics fitness class in Chiswick, west London, is making us reconsider that stereotype, tipping the scales at 18 and a half stone. 

The super-sized instructor is helping other lose weight and even says her clients like her more than her slimmer counterparts because she's not 'preachy'.

Charlotte Clarke, pictured taking  her Jungle Body class in West London, is Britain's fattest fitness instructor and says her clients feel more comfortable with her because she is not 'preachy'

Charlotte has already lost five stone herself and continues to lose weight with her classes 

Charlotte once weighed more than 23st and was so heavy that she couldn't walk up stairs without getting out of breath.

But now she leads her Jungle Body class with aplomb, despite being a size 20 with a BMI of 41.4 - making her technically obese.

Bubbly Charlotte reckons being big like her clients makes them feel more comfortable during classes and therefore they'll shed more weight in her once a week class.

She said: 'When people see me, they don't expect me to be fit. I want people to realise that you can still be overweight and healthy at the same time.

'For a big girl, going to the gym is a nightmare. You're surrounded by slim girls in Lycra - it can be very demoralising.

'When I started getting fit I would stand at the back of the class so no one could see my booty and I refused to lift my arms high so no one would see my bingo wings.

Charlotte's clients look like they are having fun whilst taking the class with her 

Charlotte decided to lose weight herself after being told by her doctor that she was incredibly unhealthy

Charlotte had piled on the pounds after gorging on jars of peanut butter and huge family sized meals 

'Some of the moves I simply had to avoid altogether because my fat would get in the way.' 

Charlotte, who has not had any children, had her own wake-up call when she visited her GP because she had a sky-high blood pressure and was experiencing pains in her joints.

She said: 'He told me I was morbidly obese and had to lose weight otherwise I would start to experience even more health problems. That was a real wake-up call.'

Charlotte had ballooned to a massive size 26 by gorging herself on jars of peanut butter and massive portions - often enough to feed an entire family.

Since deciding to become healthy, Charlotte has ditched meat and adopted a balanced, pescetarian diet.

She said: 'I ate whatever I felt like, that was the problem. Peanut butter on toast with bananas on top was my weakness - and I would skip breakfast, which was naughty.

'I wasn't a complete pig all day but I would be eat a big dinner and keep snacking throughout the night.

'Portion control for sure was a problem - the size of my dinners just spiraled out of control.'

Single Charlotte managed to shed four and a half stone using a balance of healthy eating and gym exercise and launched her Boogieful classes in October last year.

She teaches The Jungle Body, dance fitness classes that claims to burn up to 700 calories in an hour.

Charlotte sweats it out with her clients during the work out class - she said that going to the gym as a big girl is a nightmare 

Charlotte says the class is really fun because her clients get to dance around and feel like they are Beyonce 

Charlotte, who works in accounts, said: 'It's a lot of fun. It's like Zumba bit a bit more up to date. We dance around to hip hop and pretend we are Beyonce.

'I want to help plus size women get fitter and more confident and enjoy the class as part of a healthier lifestyle.'

Charlotte is still losing weight all the time, thanks to her exercise classes and balanced, healthy diet.

She added: 'I've decided to eat little and often and don't skip breakfast - I start the day with porridge with blueberries and strawberries.

'Then late morning I have a piece of fruit. For lunch, brown rice and fish. Then I have another snack, a handful of nuts or something. Then for my dinner I don't eat carbs - I stick to fish.

'And I don't have much peanut butter at all now. But when I have a craving I will just have a spoonful.'
