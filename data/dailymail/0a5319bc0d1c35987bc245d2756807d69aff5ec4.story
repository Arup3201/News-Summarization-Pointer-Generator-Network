New Manchester United signing Daley Blind has revealed how Old Trafford legend Sir Bobby Charlton still visits Louis van Gaal's team in the dressing room after every single game.

Much has been made recently of former manager Sir Alex Ferguson's relationship with the new boss at Old Trafford, with Ferguson revealing he has kept his distance from the Dutch veteran.

But it seems Sir Bobby is continuing to use his presence to try and inspire players as Van Gaal adjusts to life at his new club.

Blind – a summer signing from Ajax – said: 'It is nice to see some traditions still alive and going strong at United like, for example, the visits of Bobby Charlton in the dressing room after every game.

'Sir Bobby doesn't speak much, but he is there, standing.

'He is a living legend of his club and it means something to us that he comes.'

Sir Bobby has just celebrated his 77th birthday and remains an important figure at United.

Recently he was taken to hospital after suffering severe stomach pains while playing golf in an event in Scotland but has now returned to his normal ambassadorial duties at the club.

As for Blind, he continues to impress people at United with his simple football, drawing comparisons with vice-captain Darren Fletcher from Ferguson himself recently.

Now back from international duty, where Blind played at left-back as Holland suffered a crushing Euro 2016 qualifying defeat to Iceland, the utility player believes he is already making himself comfortable among the big signings at Old Trafford.

A product of the famous Ajax youth system, the 24-year-old also believes the education he received at the Amsterdam club has prepared him for the pressures of playing for United.

Blind said: 'I suppose we have been raised with the Amsterdamse bluf [confidence].

'I'm not a player United bought for €75million like Angel di Maria, but that doesn't make me a shy boy in the dressing room and on the training pitch.

'It's the Amsterdamse bluf that gives me that.'

Blind will be in Van Gaal's team when they travel to the Black Country to face West Brom on Monday night in the Barclays Premier League.

The start of a three-game run that also sees United face Chelsea and then Manchester City, it seems certain to test the team's resolve in the wake of their recent climb to fourth place in the table.

Former United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who also came through the ranks at Ajax and is a member of the club's management board, was also full of praise for Blind. 

'The steps he has made here in 18 months have been immense and we always try to develop multi-functional players and that benefitted him,' said the Old Trafford great. 'That multi-functionality helped him.

'With him in the middle he has more feeling for the space around him and what he can and can't do.'
