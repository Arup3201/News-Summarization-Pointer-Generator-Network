A group of mothers staging a protest in a shopping centre for their right to breastfeed in public claim they were ordered by security to cover up or be kicked out.

Mothers Diana Hitchens, Autumne Murray and Jessica Hitchens were doing a ‘nurse-in’ at a Delaware mall when, they claim, they were harassed by the guards.

The trio were breastfeeding inside a Hollister store carrying placards reading: ‘My baby has a right to eat,’ as well as ‘Do you eat in public? Why shouldn’t our babies?’

Harassed: Mother Autumne Murray says she and fellow protestors were threatened by security when they breastfed in public during a 'nurse-in' protest

Their action was in support of an incident at a Hollister shop in Houston, Texas, where a mother claims she was thrown out for breast-feeding her son.

Ms Hitchens, Ms Murray and Ms Hitches say they found themselves subjected to the very same treatment they were protesting against.

'We walked through the store and the employees asked if we needed help with anything,' said Diana Hitchens of Elkton, Maryland told NBC 10.

'We were actually nursing as we were walking through the store.'

Ms Murray, of Elkton, Maryland said two 
security guards at the Concord Mall in Wilmington walked up to them as 
they were breastfeeding telling them to cover up or leave.

She says the protesting mothers argued with the guards, showing them passages of Delaware law which states that breastfeeding in public is legal and thought that would be the end of it.

The security guards did disappear, Ms Murrey said but only to come back in the company of a Delaware State Trooper who was on patrol in the mall.

According to Ms Murray the policeman confirmed the threat from mall security.

The policeman said to her that he had been told by security that the mothers 'were exposing ourselves and that we could be kicked out of the mall if we didn’t cover up.'

The Delaware State Police told NBC10 it was a civil matter referring back to shopping centre security, whilst the Concord Mall passed the matter on to superiors returning this week.
