Newcastle United have reprimanded Cheick Tiote after the midfielder was caught clutching opened champagne while driving.

The Ivorian was reminded of his responsibilities as a role model after the episode saw him turn his back on the road.

Tiote – only recently back in the Newcastle team after injury – is thought to have been filmed back home in the Ivory Coast.

The 28-year-old issued an apology after pictures emerged of his indiscretions in The Sun on Friday night.

A statement from the north-east club read: ‘Newcastle United have been made aware of a video of Cheick Tiote driving whilst holding a bottle of alcohol, which is understood to have been filmed in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

‘Clearly his actions were not appropriate. The club have spoken privately with Cheick today and reminded him of his significant responsibilities as a representative of Newcastle United and a role model.’

Tiote showed remorse, adding: ‘I deeply regret my actions and I am sorry for any offence caused.

‘I realise that as a professional footballer I have a responsibility to many people, including the club and its supporters and it is important for me to set a good example to others with my behaviour on and off the pitch.’ 

Tiote will not be dropped for the misdemeanor, and will start for Newcastle at home to Chelsea on Saturday.
