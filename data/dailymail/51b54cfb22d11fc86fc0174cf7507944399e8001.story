An official study published in 2009 revealed that two thirds of all fresh chicken on shelves is contaminated with the potentially lethal food poisoning bug

Food poisoning cases linked to 
infected chicken are rising despite demands that supermarkets and 
farmers stop putting customers at risk.

An estimated 580,000 people each year
are falling ill with stomach upsets caused by campylobacter, the UK’s 
most common cause of food poisoning.

As many as 18,000 are so ill that they need hospital care while about 140 people die each year from the bug.

New figures published by the Food 
Standards Agency reveal the number of cases has been rising every year 
for the past four years, despite the watchdog making tackling food 
poisoning its number one priority.

Trials on farms to increase security 
and limit any chances of the spread of the bug have failed to bring down
the number of birds carrying the infection.

At the same time, a number of 
warnings to supermarkets to make sure the birds on their shelves are 
clean appear to have failed to protect public health.

A 2009 study revealed that two thirds
of all fresh chicken on shelves is contaminated with the potentially 
lethal food poisoning bug.

The latest evidence about the number of cases in humans suggests this situation has not improved.

A draft copy of the annual report by 
the FSA's chief scientist, Dr Andrew Wadge, reveals the officially 
recorded number of campylobacter cases in humans last year was 72,571, 
an increase of 0.4 per cent from 2011.

It is thought the actual number of 
cases is eight times higher, taking the total to 580,568, because the 
vast majority of sufferers do not go to their GPs.

The FSA and its advisers hoped that 
putting in place improved hygiene controls and biosecurity measures on 
chicken farms would reduce the number of infected birds.

Its strategy, which was designed to reduce the number of contaminated chicken on farms by 50 per cent by 2010, has been a hopeless failure.

In his report, Dr Wadge says: ‘Early indications from these projects suggest that compliance with these biosecurity interventions, as determined at a periodic audit, has not yet resulted in the campylobacter reductions that were predicted.’

Successive chief executives at the FSA have lambasted supermarkets for not doing enough to cut campylobacter contamination in the chicken they sell.

Its then chief executive, Tim Smith, wrote to the chief executives of all the supermarkets in 2010 demanding action. This failed to bring about the desired result and Mr Smith is now the group technical director at Tesco.

Following a failure to improve the situation, his successor, Catherine Brown, issued a new call for action in January this year, saying tackling campylobacter in chicken was her top priority.

Miss Brown called supermarket bosses to a meeting to discuss how to tackle the problem while she has hinted that stores may be required to remove chicken from sale unless they can guarantee the bug has been removed.

She said it ‘unacceptable’ that two-thirds of chicken carry the disease, while a fifth are ‘highly contaminated’ at the time of purchase.

However, yet again there is no evidence of any major drive by the supermarkets to protect customers, beyond introducing non-drip packaging.

The Government watchdog is now considering drastic measures to clean up chicken and protect consumers.

These include killing the bugs by either washing the meat with lactic acid or the use of blast freezing.

A survey by Which? found 60 per cent of shoppers would be ‘unlikely’ to buy chicken that had been sprayed or washed with a mild acid.

The FSA research said consumers would rather that the food industry provides clean and safe food, rather than treating it to disinfect it.

Its study found more people would prefer to buy a chicken that had not been treated with lactic acid than one that had – 44 per cent versus 38 per cent.

Dr Wadge’s report estimates that there are around one million cases of food poisoning from all sources each year, resulting in 20,000 hospital admissions and contributing to around 500 deaths.

The cost to the UK economy in terms of treatment and lost days of work is put at £1.8billion a year.

Norovirus, which has been linked to oysters, salmonella, listeria and e.coli are the other major causes of illness.

The number of officially recorded cases of listeria, which is particularly linked to soft unpasteurised cheese, rose from 164 in 2011 to 184 in 2012.

The disease is relatively rare but poses a particular risk to pregnant women, unborn babies and the elderly. As many as one third of sufferers admitted to hospital die from complications.
