Officials in Japan have opened Fukushima state's first beach to swimmers since last year's nuclear disaster after judging the water to be safe.

About 1,000 people yesterday descended on Nakoso beach, about 40miles south of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, where three reactors melted down after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

The opening was celebrated with beach volleyball games and hula dancers from a nearby spa.

Iwaki city official Joji Kimura said negligible radiation was detected in water at the beach.

Airborne radiation was measured at 0.08 microsieverts an hour, far below dangerous levels.

Swimming had been banned at all beaches in the state since the disaster last March.

The opening took place on the same 
day that the Japanese government came under fire over its handling of 
public hearings on nuclear energy policy.

The criticism threatens to dent already sagging support for the ruling party ahead of an election many expect to be this year.

The latest furore follows Monday's massive rally in Tokyo against nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.

Local officials and analysts say the 
issue is now so contentious that it could trump taxes as the focus of 
lower house elections, which must be held by September 2013 but could 
come sooner.

News that power company employees 
were among the few chosen to speak at hearings on changes to energy 
policy after Fukushima, the world's worst atomic disaster in 25 years, have been greeted with widespread scepticism.

Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University, said: 'This gives the impression that they haven't learned anything.'

It echoes a scandal just one year 
ago, when Kyushu Electric Power sought to sway public opinion at a 
hearing on restarting reactors in southern Japan.

In a sign of the growing discontent, 
more than 100,000 anti-nuclear protesters marched in Tokyo on Monday, 
adding to pressure on Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, already struggling 
as his Democratic Party unravels over plans to hike the sales tax to 
curb public debt.

Mr Nakano said: 'The anti-nuclear people are calling for the Democrats to be voted out.'

The rally was the biggest since Noda 
said last month that Japan needs to restart idled nuclear reactors to 
protect jobs and the economy.

The government is considering three 
options for its medium-term energy portfolio - reduce nuclear power's 
role to zero as soon as possible, aim at a 15 per cent share by 2030, 
and seek a 20 to 25 per cent share by the same date.

The new energy mix, to be decided in 
August, will replace a scrapped 2010 programme that had sought to raise 
nuclear power's share to more than half of electricity needs by 2030 
from about 30 per cent before the March 2011 disaster.

The Fukushima disaster forced some 
150,000 people to flee their homes, many never to return. Some committed
 suicide after seeing their homes and livelihoods destroyed.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said the government would be looking at how to improve the hearings.
