This is the terrifying moment a lone British sailor was left clinging to the wreckage of his yacht in the dark after it was damaged in a storm.

Mick Royton, 52, was left stranded almost 40 miles from land when his trimaran boat lost its mast in heavy weather and was in danger of capsizing in rough seas.

He made a desperate mayday radio call to emergency services after a log was washed into the yacht, breaking one of its three hulls and damaging the other.

To stop the boat from breaking up completely, Mr Royton cut the mast and rigging down from the boat before putting a wetsuit on to stay warm in the horrendous conditions.

A major air and sea search was launched for Mr Royton, whose original position was 37 miles south of the Isle of Wight.

Two coastguard helicopters and two offshore lifeboats were dispatched to search a 250 square mile area but rescuers were forced to call off the hunt as the weather worsened.

The stricken yacht was chanced upon at around 4am yesterday by naval frigate HMS St Albans which was on its way to its home port of Portsmouth from Plymouth. At this point, he had been drifting for about 12 hours.

Lookouts spotted the severely damaged yacht, called Kinetic, languishing around 30 miles from its original position.

The boat had drifted and was 18 miles south of Portland Bill in Dorset when it was discovered.

HMS St Albans, a 436ft warship, was used as a wind shield while lifeboat crews from Weymouth plucked Mr Royton from his damaged boat.

Mr Royton, who is currently unemployed, had been sailing from Lannion in Brittany, France, to Poole, Dorset, when he got into difficulties.

He was taken to Weymouth then rushed to Dorset County Hospital in nearby Dorchester suffering from hypothermia.

Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Royton said: 'I was just very grateful to get off the boat at that time because the wind was picking up and big waves could have sunk it. I still could have died from hypothermia.

'I feel a bit battered and tired but I feel okay.

'I set off from Lannion, France at dusk on Sunday. I sailed south past Guernsey. The wind was picking up all the time and so did the waves.

'When my canoe got washed over the side, I decided to take the jib down and have a rest.

'I tied the canoe up and had a cup of coffee. I was debating whether to carry on sailing.

'All of a sudden there was a loud bang and a very big wave with a log hit both the floaters breaking one in half and seriously damaging the other.

'I decided in order to lengthen the period of time between the next one breaking and falling off I needed to get the mast down.

'It wasn't until the next afternoon that the other floater started to sink.

'I had already taken the precaution of putting a wetsuit on.

'I thought the boat was going to flip over and sink.'

Despite his ordeal, Mr Royton, from Brighton, said he had not been put off sailing and he was already forming plans to recover his yacht.

He added: 'I hope to go out and find my boat but if not I shall build another one.'

Catherine Jordan, commanding officer of HMS St Albans, said: 'We initially responded to reports of a capsized trimaran with an unknown number of people onboard.

'Weather conditions were initially very difficult but this gradually improved as the night went on and eventually the moon broke the cloud cover which provided us with good illumination.

'Following a search of over 250 square nautical miles at 0315 an unlit yacht with no mast and significant damage was spotted by the bridge team some 30 miles from the original mayday position.

'The weather at this point deteriorated again and due to the difficult sea state and fragile condition of the yacht we were only able to close the distance, provide a windbreak, and offer reassurance until the lifeboat arrived.

'The sailor was quite disorientated - he had been drifting since about 4pm the previous day.'

Andy Sergeant, the coxswain for Weymouth lifeboat, added: 'He was very lucky to have been found.'
