Former All-Pro NFL safety Darren Sharper who’s been accused of sexually assaulting women in five different states was indicted in Arizona on Wednesday on charges he administered dangerous drugs to two Tempe women and sexually assaulted them in November.

It was the latest development in a shockingly long succession of sexual assault investigations involving the 38-year-old Sharper in Louisiana, California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada.

Sharper has only been formally charged with raping women in Los Angeles and now in Phoenix, but authorities suspect the former New Orleans Saint of raping nine women in total.

Sharper is currently in custody in Los Angeles, where he has pleaded not guilty to seven rape and drug counts in connection with two alleged attacks in Hollywood.

He had been freed on $1 million bail, but was tossed back behind bars when an arrest warrant was issued in the New Orleans case.

Sharper was an analyst for the NFL until he was fired last week.

The indictment Arizona has not yet been publicly released. A call to the county prosecutor's office, which runs grand jury investigations, wasn't immediately returned.

Police reports indicate that two women accused Sharper of raping them at a Tempe apartment on Nov. 21.

One of the women told police she suspected she had been drugged before she was attacked.

Sharper’s Arizona attorney Skip Donau told USA Today that Sharper has a ‘prior relationship’ with one of the victims there.

‘I talked to Darren, and he vigorously denies the allegations,’ Donau said. ‘We're going to contest them vigorously, and we expect at the end of the process he'll be vindicated.’

Records show that Sharper is accused of largely the crimes in each state. He allegedly meets women socially, slips sedatives in their drinks and then rapes them as they lay unconscious.

His attorneys maintain Sharper had only consensual sex with these women.

Back in the slammer: After he was charged in LA, Sharper was freed on $1 million bond. However, he was thrown back in jail after Arizona officially filed charges for his alleged sexual assault of two Tempe women in November

USA Today reports that in the investigation that ensued following the Arizona rapes, the drug Ambien was found on a drink cup.

The police report indicates that Sharper accompanied two women to a Tempe apartment, then gave them cocktails he prepared.

Bygone days: Sharper made it to the Super Bowl with the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers. He retired in 2010 and, until he was fired last week, became an analyst with the NFL network

One of the women passed out immediately, while the other fell ill after drinking the cocktail.

The sick woman claims she excused herself to the bathroom then subsequently saw Sharper naked atop her unconscious friend.

‘She reported being concerned that the sexual act was not consensual because she did not know if (the other woman) was awake,’ reads the report.

When confronted, Sharper allegedly 
told one of the women: ‘I don't really remember. I guess I could have 
done that. I'm really sorry.’

Prosecutors
 in New Orleans said Wednesday there will not be an indictment of 
Sharper there by Thursday, a deadline set by a California judge who said
 she would have to release Sharper if charges weren't filed by then in 
Louisiana.

New Orleans 
Assistant District Attorney Christopher Bowman said the case remained 
under investigation. As of Wednesday, only an arrest warrant had been 
issued.

Sharper was 
selected All-Pro six times and chosen for the Pro Bowl five times. He 
played in two Super Bowls, one with the Green Bay Packers as a rookie 
and was part of a successful championship run while with the New Orleans
 Saints.

He retired after the 2010 season and was working as an analyst for the NFL Network before being fired last week.
