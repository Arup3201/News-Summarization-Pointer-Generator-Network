A nationwide manhunt has been launched in India after four young girls were abducted from a care home in India and gang raped by up to 20 men.

Detectives said the group of armed kidnappers raided the hostel at Lawada village in Pakur district and snatched four young girls, all aged between 12 and 14.

Superintendent Y S Ramesh told reporters that the girls, who are from the Paharia tribe, are being treated at a nearby hospital.

He said the suspects have gone on the run and are being hunted by police across the country.

It is the latest of a string of appalling rape cases that have sent shockwaves through India in recent months, raised questions across the international community over the treatment of women in the country and led to a swift overhaul of sexual assault laws.

It comes days after a 20-year-old college student was gang-raped and set on fire in Etawah, in Uttar Pradesh, the hometown of the region's Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

In that case, shockingly,
the police not only initially refused to register a case but also 
appeared to have abdicated their responsibility to maintain law and 
order.

The police brass expressed helplessness in curbing the rising 
incidents of rape in the state, which recorded 126 such assaults last week alone. In 20 of those 
cases, the victims were killed.

In the capital Delhi it emerged last week that there have been 806 cases of rape reported in just the first six months of this year, equalling more than four a day, compared to 706 cases recorded in all of 2012.

Meanwhile, an Indian juvenile court will hand down a verdict later this month in the now infamous gang rape of a young woman on a New Delhi bus who was dumped and left to die by the side of the road last December.

The verdict would be the first handed down in the rape case, which led to furious street protests in India and sparked major reforms to the nation's antiquated sexual assault laws.

Lawyer Rajesh Tiwari told reporters outside the court that his client would learn his fate July 25. The defendant was 17 at the time of the attack and is being tried as a minor on charges including murder and rape.

He faces a maximum sentence of three years at a reform center. Court rules forbid the publication of his name even though he has since turned 18.

The defendant was one of six people accused of tricking a young woman and her male companion into boarding an off-duty bus December 16.

Police say the men then raped and brutalized the woman and savagely beat the man before dumping them on the roadside. The woman died from her injuries two weeks later in a Singapore hospital.

Four of the other defendants are being tried in a special fast-track court in New Delhi and face the death penalty. The sixth accused was found dead in his jail cell in March.
