From a floating jelly fish to a relaxed seal, Britain's beach life is captured above and below the water in this series of dramatic shots.

The split level photographs were taken by marine biologist Andrew Pearson, 32, after he spent time researching underwater life in Cornwall and Dorset.

'People don't always realise what is under the water just a few feet from a UK beach and how interesting it can be,' says Pearson, who lives in Southampton.

'I find "split level" or "half and half" photography captures a unique perspective not often seen by many people,' he says.

'It's a really effective way of taking pictures of marine life or people underwater in the context of the wider coastal environment.

'People are surprised how clear the water can be and just how much marine life you get so close to shore, around the UK.

'Sometimes people think the shots are taken abroad in the tropics or Mediterranean,' he adds.

To capture the perfect picture, the keen photographer uses a wide angle camera lens and spends a great deal of time finding the best locations, checking the tides and ensuring the weather is correct, before wading into the cold water.

'It can take a lot of patience to get the perfect picture when you're in less than perfect conditions,' says Pearson.

'It depends on lots of factors, such as if an animal is shy or inquisitive or how calm the day is.

'I have always had a passion for marine biology and ecology, and spend a lot of my spare time enjoying activities at the sea, such as surfing, scuba diving, kayaking.

'Often I would be down at the beach or in the sea and see something amazing and think, I which I had a camera.

'We have a huge diversity of marine wildlife around our coasts which needs to be protected.'
