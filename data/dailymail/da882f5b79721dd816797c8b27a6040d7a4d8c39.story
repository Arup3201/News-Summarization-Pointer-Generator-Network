David Brown, 62, from Accrington, Lancashire, was spotted standing near women with a Samsung Galaxy attached to his shoelaces with velcro

A 62-year-old married man who filmed up women's skirts in a DIY shop only did it because he had taken too much of his medicine, a court heard.

A security guard at B&Q spotted David
 Brown, 62, creeping up beside women wearing short dresses and skirts with a Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 attached to his 
shoelaces with velcro, Blackburn magistrates were told.

Police
 were called to the Blackburn branch of the DIY giant and Brown, who is married and whose wife Eileen is standing by him, was stopped as he went to leave the store, saying: 'I'm sorry, am I in the s*** now?', the prosecutor said.

It
 emerged that the father-of-one from Accrington, Lancashire, had filmed a number of women over a period of a month after taking medication which gave him 'hypersexuality.'

Today Brown, who told police: 'It got to be a habit', pleaded guilty
 to outraging public decency following the incidents between April and 
May last year.

Prosecutor
 Cathy Allan said: 'The defendant was in B&Q. A staff member saw the
 defendant described as fixated on an unknown female wearing a very 
short summer dress.

'He
 approached her, right up next to her, so close it was believed he was 
going to collide with her. He placed his foot near the back of her shoe.

'He
 then approached another woman and moved to place an item on his shoe 
before moving his foot outstretched. She walked off unaware. When he 
went to leave the store he was detained.'

Miss
 Allan said Brown had filmed a video looking up at females' skirts, and there was further video footage on his phone showing other videos he had made the same way between 11 April 2013 and 18 
May 2013.

She added: 'When arrested he told police it had "got to be a habit". It is described as 'upskirting'.

Defence lawyer Richard Prew said Brown was 'utterly distraught' at what he had done.

He added: 'He is 62, no previous convictions, never known to the police
 and courts and was leading a law-abiding lifestyle.

'He
 was on a high dose of medication and had taken a higher dose than he 
should have done. One of the side effects was hypersexuality - although 
it in no way excuses what he did.

'The
 behaviour was completely out of character. The victims were unaware of 
his actions and have never been identified.

'The defendant quite candidly
 said that if this had happened to his wife of daughter he would have 
been absolutely distraught himself.'

Mr Prew said Brown had sought counselling, and was now on a lower dose of the medication - which wasn't named - which was proved to cause the problem.

He added: 'There
 is no public interest in sending him to prison today. The experience he
 has had to go through, whilst taking nothing away from the victims has 
been a salutary lesson to him.'

Brown was given a 12-month community order and ordered to pay Â£85 costs and a Â£60 victim surcharge.

Chairman
 of the bench, Peter Jump, said: 'The probation service indicated there is low risk of reoffending and believe it has been a salutary lesson for the defendant.'
