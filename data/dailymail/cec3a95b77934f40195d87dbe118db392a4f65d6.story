Lounging on the studio sofa of ‘shock jock’ radio DJ Howard Stern, the pouting young woman didn’t exactly hold back on the electoral appeal of the man who, until a few days ago, was set to become New York’s next mayor.

Sydney Leathers observed this week that the controversial politician Anthony Weiner was simply too distracted enjoying the company of girls like herself on the internet to do anything for the city. Only she didn’t quite couch it in language suitable for a family newspaper.

But she should know what she is talking about. In an expletive-laden interview about her online exchanges with the married father and already scandal-hit Democrat politician, the 23-year-old student revealed how an innocent communication on the web led to a sordid relationship.

She related how Weiner — sometimes using the pseudonym Carlos Danger — detailed his sexual fantasies, including sex in the shower. He also sent her naked pictures of himself during their six-month relationship, which began in July 2012. ‘He could have 12 girls talking to him [on the net] . . . and that wouldn’t be enough,’ she observed. His conversations, either by phone or via the web, would start with small talk which suddenly ended as he told her to take off her clothes. A few minutes of torrid sex talk later, he’d awkwardly thank her and hang up.

When Miss Leathers started to cool over their unpleasant trysts last year, he would pester her with phone calls, insisting — though they had never met — he was madly in love with her.

‘There were times he’d talk to me multiple times a day. He was like this needy girlfriend or something,’ she laughed, before revealing to Howard Stern that, yes, the rumours were true that she is considering milking her new-found fame further with a career in pornography. Her manager — naturally, she already has one — has promised to get her some ‘new big boobs’.

Yesterday, a scandal that has enthralled America for days after Leathers went public showed no signs of abating as Weiner pledged to keep fighting in the mayoral race.

At the same time, it emerged that his communications director had delivered a foul-mouthed diatribe — including the words ‘slutbag’, ‘t***’ and ‘c***’ — at an intern who had dared to criticise the Weiner campaign.

Classy it ain’t, but then Americans have come to expect nothing less from the implausibly named Weiner (which is by an appalling coincidence U.S. slang for the male organ), a man who makes Boris Johnson look like a monk. For the priapic Weiner — at 48 just a year younger than Boris — could teach London’s mayor a lesson or two about debauched behaviour and utter shamelessness.

New York politicians have never let infamy get in the way of a comeback, but Weiner is testing voters to the very limit. As for the rest of America, it doesn’t know whether to cry at the sheer awfulness of it all, or simply laugh at Weiner’s bare-faced cheek in refusing to give up his campaign.

Through his high-powered wife Huma Abedin’s status as a top aide and confidante to Hillary Clinton, the scandal is now threatening the course of the next presidential election. According to reports, the Clinton camp believes a continuing Weiner scandal could well damage Mrs Clinton’s election hopes if she runs for President in 2016.

To describe Anthony Weiner as a 
repeat offender is putting it mildly. Two years ago, he was forced to 
resign as a U.S. congressman after admitting that he had been exchanging
lewd photos and messages with at least six young women who followed him
on Twitter.

After days
of feeble half-denials, the workaholic, brash and hugely ambitious 
Weiner was forced to own up: he had indeed sent a picture of his private
parts to a 21-year-old woman in Seattle.

Sydney Leathers, left, has said Anthony Weiner was too distracted enjoying the company of girls like herself on the internet to do anything for New York.  The women Weiner communicated with online turned out to included a 28-year-old porn star calling herself Ginger Lee (pictured right)

Unfortunately, he also mistakenly sent it to all 45,000 of his Twitter followers. (Worse, his confession came only after he had spent £30,000 hiring a private security firm to investigate if his Twitter account had been hacked, when he knew it hadn’t.)

The women he communicated with online turned out to include a 40-year-old blackjack dealer from Las Vegas, a 35-year-old cheerleading coach, and a 28-year-old porn star calling herself Ginger Lee.

Although he had never met any of them, Weiner said he was ‘deeply ashamed’ of his ‘terrible judgment and actions’, which he called ‘very dumb’.

Others instead wondered about the judgment of his glamorous wife, after Weiner revealed she was standing by him as they prepared to have their first child, (now 17 months old).

Ms Abedin — a 37-year-old Muslim American of Indian and Pakistani parents — was Mrs Clinton’s deputy chief of staff when she was U.S. Secretary of State and is one of her longest-serving aides. Weiner’s wife, who earns a £165,000 salary, first met her future husband at a party convention in 2001, and they started going out together in 2008.

Numerous sordid jokes — and worse, pictures — of ‘Weiner’s weiner’ would have caused less ambitious politicians to retreat under a stone and never emerge again, but Weiner’s ego, to say nothing of his sexual urges, were not to be kept in check for long.

In May this year, he announced via a YouTube video that he would be standing for New York mayor, seeking to replace the billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg.

By then, he and his wife had had their son, a ‘sparkling wonder’ they named Jordan Zain Weiner.

Announcing the birth to friends by 
email, he gushed: ‘Did I mention his mom is amazing?’ That’s one way of 
describing her. She has so far stuck by his side with a limpet-like 
doggedness that has split opinion among women.

In
a magazine profile, the couple portrayed themselves as the perfect 
happily married proud parents — he, a dutiful father who had sought 
counselling for his sexual proclivities, and generally learnt the error 
of his ways.

But is 
Weiner’s wife guilty only of love and loyalty — perhaps of gullibility, 
too — or is she indulging in Machiavellian scheming aimed at fostering 
her own political ambitions by making herself look positively saintly?

Some commentators have already suggested she should be the one running for mayor, not Weiner.

Last week, after the latest scandal broke, Ms Abedin told a New York press conference: ‘I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him. Anthony’s made some horrible mistakes, both before he resigned from Congress and after. But I do believe that is between us, and our marriage.’

And in an article for the latest edition
of Harper’s Bazaar, written before the latest scandal, she enthused: 
‘Anthony has always been a smart, caring, and dedicated person, and 
while he’s the same public servant who wants what’s best for the people 
he represents, he is now something else — a better man. New Yorkers will
have to decide for themselves whether or not to give him a second 
chance.’

So far it looks as if those voters have decided — and the omens are not good. Weiner has slipped from front runner to fourth place in the polls among Democratic candidates in the race. Ominously, he says he doesn’t know how many more compromising emails and pictures are out there.

Certainly, as one of the women he has been communicating with so graphically on the internet, Sydney Leathers couldn’t have done more damage this week.

Voicing sentiments even the most pro-Weiner voter must share, she told Howard Stern: ‘What p****d me off was him on the campaign trail saying “Oh, I’ve changed”, and trying to act like he has this perfect marriage now and everything’s just peachy . . . I’m proof [he] has not changed.’

She says Weiner ‘lured’ her into their online affair after she wrote to him — as a Democratic supporter — on Facebook to express her disappointment in his previous sexual shenanigans. A year later, she said, he responded on Facebook and apologised for letting her down. Almost at once, however, he began pursuing her.

‘That’s what really got me,’ she told Stern. ‘That he’s supposedly getting help, but in reality he’s flirting with me. He talked to me more about his two cats than he did about his child or his wife.’

Although TV cameras caught Weiner off-guard this week looking hollow-eyed, he is struggling on. In a new advert yesterday on his campaign website — in which his wife didn’t appear — Weiner vowed to keep running for mayor, because quitting ‘isn’t the way we roll in New York’. With jaw-dropping nerve, he added: ‘This isn’t about me. This is about helping New Yorkers.’

It’s difficult to see those voters taking him up on his generous offer.
