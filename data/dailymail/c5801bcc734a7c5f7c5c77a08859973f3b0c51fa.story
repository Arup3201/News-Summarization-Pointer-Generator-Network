The London flat that Jimi Hendrix once described as 'the only home I ever had' is to be turned into a museum with money from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Rooms in 23 Brook Street where Hendrix paid £30 a week to live will be restored to their 1960s splendor to offer music-lovers a glimpse into how the late legend lived.

More than £1million will be poured into displays of the Purple Haze singer's life and work.

The musician, who has been hailed as the best guitarist of all time, came to Britain in 1966 as a relatively unknown American artist.

His celebrity soon grew however, with music industry icons such as John Lennon, Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger gathering to hear him perform, the Guardian reports.

Hendrix moved into the Mayfair property in 1968 to live with his then girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham.

Kathy reportedly completely furnished the flat with their joint possessions and purchases, including curtains and carpets from John Lewis on Oxford Street.

They lived in the flat for three months, using it as a base for Hendrix to conduct interviews and write music.

Just two doors down was the former home of the classical music composer, George Frideric Handel. 

On learning that Handel used to live 
next door, Hendrix allegedly went to the nearby One Stop Record Shop in South Molton
 Street and bought the composer's Messiah 
and Water Music.

The separate properties that were built in 1971 are now linked together as the Handel House Museum.

Hendrix died aged 27 in Notting Hill hotel just two years after moving into the property. His death is believed to have been caused by choking following a drug overdose.

The Handel House Museum saw huge numbers of visitors when they put on a one-off exhibition of Hendrix's former home in 2010 to mark the 40th anniversary of his death (pictured)

Handel died in his bedroom at the 
Brook Street property in 1759. The Handel House Museum was created in 
2001 after the former tenant, a building society, moved out.

The
 rooms occupied by the composer have been restored to their Georgian appearance, though those lived in by the guitarist became museum
 staff offices.

But when the rooms went on display for a few hours during annual Heritage Open Days, places were booked out instantly an exhibition marking the 40th anniversary of the musician's death was sold out.

The looming grant of £1.2million will allow staff to have their offices separately, and allow visitors to admire Hendrix's former home.

The musician, hailed as the greatest guitarist of all time, moved to London in 1966. He died just four years later in Notting Hill

Wesley Kerr, chair of the London 
committee of the Heritage Lottery Fund, said 'The Handel House Museum is
 one of the most precious and evocative places in London. 

'To
 visit the beautifully restored home where one of history's greatest 
composers lived, and invented some of the finest music ever written, is 
already pure joy.'
