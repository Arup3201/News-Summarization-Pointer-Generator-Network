One of New York's Super Bowl winners has got some advice for Gisele Bundchen about how to be magnanimous in the face of defeat - as animosity in Boston following the Patriots' Super Bowl loss grew.

New York Giants running back Brandon Jacobs thinks the supermodel's retaliation to chants about her husband Tom Brady following the Boston Patriots defeat on Sunday was ill-advised.

'She just needs to continue to be cute and shut up,' Jacobs said as he celebrated his win at the MetLife Stadium rally for the Super Bowl champion Giants in New York today.

Meanwhile many people in Boston are angry with the supermodel after she yelled that her husband can't 'f***ing throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time.'

Scroll down to watch Gisele's outburst...

The Boston Herald’s Margery Eagan 
wrote that Bündchen put her 'Super Foot in her Super Mouth again,' while
longtime KISS 108 DJ Matt Siegel compared Bündchen to the woman often blamed for breaking up The Beatles, John Lennon's outspoken wife Yoko Ono. 

'They were killing her,' Fox news 
reports that Boston native Stacia Wadlington Bradley said of the popular
morning show.

'VB (Goudie) on Fox 25 roasted her, too. Let's just say 
she's not very popular around here these days.'

Attorney Joesph P. DeStefano noted: 'The Patriots have not won a Super Bowl since Brady’s been with Gisele.'

Before adding: 'Sports radio guys in 
Boston have called Gisele Yoko Ono for years, but now with her comments 
after the Super Bowl, it’s reached a peak. For example, on WEEI this 
morning the whole crew ragged on her, saying that she should have kept 
her mouth shut.'

Wide receiver Wes Welker, who dropped a crucial pass in the fourth quarter, also found himself on the end of some mockery as 900lbs of Butterfingers candy was dumped in the centre of Boston.

More hindrance than help? Though she was clearly as upset as her husband Gisele 
attempted to lift his spirits following his team's defeat in the Super 
Bowl

'Everyone in Boston is seething about Gisele’s comments,' added Boston-based travel agent Ellen Petschaft Berrios.

The Herald's Raakhee Mirchandani described her as: 'All beauty, little brain.'

Explanding that: 'Gisele should have 
tossed her golden locks, ignored the drunken fools and whispered to 
herself, 'I made $45 million last year, I own a multi-million-dollar 
Brentwood mansion and my husband has amazing hair.'

She also noted that she 'appears to have an advanced degree from Gwyneth Paltrow’s charmless school.'

Both Mirchandani and Eagan recalled equally ill-advised remarks the mother-of-one made about breast-feeding and pregnancy.

She was quoted as telling the UK's 
Harpers Bazaar: 'Some people here think they don’t have to breast-feed, 
and I think, ‘Are you going to give chemical food to your child, when 
they are so little?’

'There should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breast-feed their babies for six months.

Then adding to Vogue: 'I think a lot of people get pregnant and decide they can turn into garbage disposals.

'I was mindful about what I ate, and I gained only 30 pounds.'

Eagan went further, accusing Bundchen 
of trying to turn 'All-American Tom' into Euro trash, insulting 'kinky 
brit' David Beckham along the way.

She wrote: ' She seems intent on 
euro-trashing up our All-American Tom, as if she’d prefer some version 
of soccer great David Beckham, the breathtaking tattooed one whose 
Sistine Chapel body fairly quivered in tight underpants in an H&M 
Super Bowl ad Sunday. Pretty kinky.

'But Tom Brady is not euro-trashy, Brazilian, or a kinky Brit. He actually used to wear sweatpants.'

Just moments after Brady's team lost 
to the New York Giants 21-17, the supermodel was overheard slamming her 
husband's side in response to taunts from a fans.

While waiting for the elevator to leave the VIP suites at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Giselle let rip in a F-word rant which saw her slam his teammates efforts on the field.

In video footage capture by theinsider.com,
she was heard saying: 'My husband can not f****ing throw the ball and 
catch the ball at the same time. I can't believe they dropped the ball 
so many times.'

Later the Brazilian model met with her husband behind the scenes at the event where she consoled him with hugs.

Thousands of fans roared as New York 
Giants quarterback Eli Manning hoisted the team's Super Bowl trophy, 
awarded to the NFL champions, from a glittering blue-and-white float 
during a victory parade through New York City.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg quipped during the ceremony today that the city should now be nicknamed the 'Big Blue Apple.'

The
parade began at the southern tip of Manhattan and moved north to City 
Hall as fans were clad head-to-toe in Giants gear and confetti wafted 
slowly down from the high-rises lining the street.

Manning, joined by coach Tom 
Coughlin, Mayor Bloomberg, Gov Andrew Cuomo and other teammates, waved 
and grinned from the float as a deep roar rose from the crowds.

Defensive
end Justin Tuck, who led the team's defense and sacked rival 
quarterback Tom Brady twice during the 21-17 victory over the New 
England Patriots, said he was glad to be part of the team.

'We
made it here by believing in each other. We believe in every guy on 
this team,' he said. 'Honestly, we wouldn't be here today without your 
support.'The team was introduced at a City Hall Plaza ceremony with thunderous applause from the thousands of fans outside.

The crowd went wild for running back Ahmed Bradshaw, who plopped down in the end zone to score the winning touchdown.

Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz did his trademark salsa moves as he accepted his key.

Manning joked about the team's record
of fourth-quarter comebacks. 'Make it tough but make it possible,' he 
said, laughing about how the team blew an early lead to come back and 
win.

The Giants had eight fourth-quarter comebacks to win games during the season.

'Finish games, finish fourth quarters and finish the season strong. That's what we did,' Manning said.

The
team was introduced with thunderous applause from the lucky 250 fans 
who got tickets to a ceremony at City Hall Plaza, where the Giants were 
honoured with symbolic keys to the city.

Mayor
Bloomberg reminded the cheering crowd that this was the second Super 
Bowl championship parade for the Giants in four years.
