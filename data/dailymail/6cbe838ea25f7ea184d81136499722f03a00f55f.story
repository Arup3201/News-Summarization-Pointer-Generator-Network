Twin baby boys were laid to rest yesterday on what would have been their first birthday after their father slit their throats before strangling their mom and killing himself.

Mei Jum Jones and her sons, Colt and Cameron, were found dead last week at their home in Boston, Masachusetts, alongside her husband Scott Jones.

Mei and her boys were given a private funeral yesterday where only friends and family were invited.

Mei Kum Jones and her twin sons Colt and Cameron were laid to rest together on what would have been their first birthday

Mourners stood in silence as two tiny caskets were carried along the road.

Dozens of people later attended a candle lit vigil organized in their memories.

Their family and friends have paid tribute to Mei and the twins on an online guest book.

Mei's
 brother Benjamin Li wrote: 'Mei, you were wonderful sister and even 
more loving and caring mom who loved your boys Colt and Cameron more 
than life itself.

'Your life was cut way to short and the boys did not 
deserve the [fate] that was handed them. You and my nephews will be 
sorely missed.'

Catherine 
Li, believed to be Mr Li's wife, wrote: 'Mei, I love you so much and you
 were such a great sister in law and a truely amazing Auntie to our 
boys.

'It's devastating that they will grow up without you and their 
cousins, but we will tell them how incredibly strong and loving you 
were. The three of you will be missed forever.'

Police discovered the bodies after they were asked to check up on the family

The bodies of the family were found at their home in Arlington last Monday after police were asked to check on them.

It is believed the couple were having marital problems in the weeks before and may have settled on a divorce.

Mei, 43, had recently posted comments on Massachusetts Mothers of Twins Associations comments referring to the split.

She wrote: 'I will soon be a single mom to my twin boys.'

In another post she wrote: 'It breaks my heart for the boys to grow up in a divorce family.

'Their dad will probably not be in their lives either. I need to find a way to cope.'

Police had previously been called to the home on two different occasions before the twins were born last year.

In the summer of 2010, they were called to the Arlington home after Scott Jones threatened to kill himself.

The bodies were found in Arlington, Massachusetts, a suburb about twenty minutes northwest of Boston

The Boston Herald reports that the reason for the second call has not been revealed.

Scott
 Jones, a longtime Boston-area paramedic, had filed a lawsuit accusing 
his former employer of inflicting severe emotional distress by firing 
him when he complained about faulty medical equipment.

Attorney
 Timothy Burke, who represented Scott Jones in the lawsuit, filed three 
weeks ago against LifeLine Ambulance Services, said his client appeared 
happy with his marriage and family.

'There was no indication that there is a problem internally whatsoever, just the opposite,' Burke said.

Jones
 noted in the lawsuit that he was a decorated paramedic, having received
 the highest award given to emergency medical technicians, the Star of 
Life Award, and a letter of recognition from then-U.S. Rep. Ed Markey 
for his efforts to save lives when an employee opened fire at an 
Internet consulting company in Wakefield, the Boston Globe reported 
Tuesday.

Seven people were 
killed when the assailant, wielding a shotgun and a rifle, shot 
colleagues before being subdued by police in December 2000.
