At first glance, photographer Luca Meneghel's series Into the Mirror seems to show a model wearing a series of delicate black and nude gowns, framed artistically by an oval picture frame.

On closer inspection, though, the model is actually adorned in gowns that haqve been hand drawn onto the surface of a mirror.

The model, Nasty Bugriy, stands perfectly aligned with the drawings, created by Norma Nardi, with simple hair and make-up by Sabin Gutwegner and styling by Erin Fox that allows the drawings to take center stage.

The result is a photo spread that falls somewhere between high fashion and fantasy.

Nardi's illustrations create the appearance of different fabrics and textures, shadow and depth are added with shading and the dresses appear to be fitted perfectly to the body of the model.

The dreamy portraits are a striking convergence of the mediums of fashion photography and fashion illustration.

Mirror, mirror: The model wears an ornate gown made of Sharpie markings on a mirror

Bejeweled: A gorgeous hand-drawn necklace adorns the model's neck

Artful: The mirror sketches fit better than any real dress could

Designer drawings: The model wore only nude underwear for this shoot full of gorgeous dresses

Draws the eye: The hair and make-up are simple, in contrast to the intricate detail of the dresses

Bejeweled: The model 'wears' a drawing of a Dolce and Gabbana earring

Dress ups: Nardi's sketches create the folds and movement of a real garment
