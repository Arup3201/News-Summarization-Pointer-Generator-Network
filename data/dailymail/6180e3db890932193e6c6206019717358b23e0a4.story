Michaela Hutchings went on a spending spree after £50,000 was mistakenly put into her bank account

Designer clothes bought by a single mother after more than £50,000 of council money was mistakenly put in her bank account are being auctioned by police on eBay.

Michaela Hutchings, 23, used £51,821 accidentally transferred into her account by Lichfield Council to buy expensive designer shoes, handbags and sunglasses in a spending splurge last year.

After she was caught, a judge spared her jail on the condition she paid the money back by Christmas Eve.

Now the high-class fashion items, 
including luxury labels such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Ralph Lauren and 
Dior, will be auctioned by Staffordshire Police.

The small fortune should have gone to Bromford Housing Association.

The
 internet auction starts tomorrow after Hutchings was convicted of 
dishonesty and retaining a wrongly-credited bank transfer and was handed
 a 12 month supervision order.

She was also told to carry out 150 hours unpaid work.

A
 confiscation hearing ordered the 23-year-old to repay the £51,821 bank 
transfer, plus £643 interest and the auction will help pay that order.

The vast majority of the money has been recovered, but Hutchings still owes £5,733 from the designer clothes spree and interest.

Pressure: Hutchings blamed pressure from her now ex-boyfriend for the Birminham spending spree

In just two days, Hutchings had spent thousands.

She spent the money on £5,000 worth of designer goods, including shoes, jeans and sunglasses and a £1,000 gift to her family.

Hutchings
  also transferred £40,000 into an investment account after being 
advised by her bank, which was oblivious to the error.

After 
April's court appearance, Hutchings said: 'I'm so ashamed. I did wrong 
and I'm sorry, but before you judge me, put yourself in my shoes. I was a
 single mum - money isn't always easy. But this was not how I was 
brought up.'

She claimed her ex-partner encouraged her to keep the unexpected windfall.

She added: 'Of course I take responsibility, but there was definitely an influence from my boyfriend.

'I
 have never been out of work. I know it's my fault that everyone around 
me is suffering, and that is so hard. Just one bad decision can change 
your life.' 

Hutchings
 said she only discovered the money while withdrawing cash on a trip to 
buy milk, and when she quizzed her bank over the sum, they couldn't tell
 her where it had come from.

She
 maintains that she wouldn't have touched the money had it not been for 
her ex-boyfriend, who she says took her to Birmingham's Bull Ring 
Shopping Centre to spend the cash.

The pair went to Selfridges where, according to Hutchings, her boyfriend bought thousands of pounds worth of designer clothes, shoes, belts and sunglasses.

At the hearing earlier this year, Recorder Derek Desmond said: 'On 24 April last year, a little over £52,000 was put in to your account in error.

'That had nothing to do with you. You didn't cause that error, but you decided to keep it, knowing, after a short while it was wrong and you failed to take reasonable steps to cancel it.

'I have no doubt you were influenced by your partner, he wanted to spend the money. You went on a spending spree and between you, you spent £9,000.

'This man who spurred you on is no longer in your life - no doubt your family will be glad about that.'

Hutchings said she and her ex-boyfriend spent thousands of pounds in Selfridges in Birmingham
