Fernando Torres has been playing as a single, lone striker since he was 17-years-old, when he broke into the first team at Atletico Madrid.

He captained that team and has always played as the lone man up-front, taking relentless kick after kick.

His devastating pace was used to get in behind defences with very few managers wanting or expecting good link-up play around the half-way line.

Finished: Fernando Torres will never rediscover the strengths that made him the player he was

Deadly: In his pomp Torres used devastating pace and movement to beat defenders

He was always on the shoulder of the centre backs.

Kenny Dalglish wrote in his book that Fernando needed to have a break as he had been playing non-stop, through the summers in World Cups, the Confederations Cups, or the Euros.

He had not had a break and played virtually continuously for eight years.

No rest: Torres played almost continuously for eight years and injuries have taken their toll

His strength was in his explosive speed, similar to a Formula One car.

But being constantly on full throttle that sharp edge has blunted and he has slowed down.

Injuries, kicks and fatigue would no doubt have set in and it is now impossible for him to rediscover what he had.

It's time to let him go.

Out of touch: Torres has just four Premier League goals this season and none since January

When Jose Mourinho picked a team for the Champions League quarter-final with no centre forward, even though he had two on the bench in Demba Ba and Torres, he was sending a message loud and clear to Mr Abramovich, who hovers above him, that a top quality centre forward is needed.

His gamble on Samuel Eto'o has paid off to a certain extent, but he is not as quick as he once was and he's nearly my age.

Message: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was sending a message to Roman Abramovich when he didn't start a striker in the Champions League against Paris Saint-Germain

Investment: Mourinho wants the Chelsea owner to invest in a new top class striker in the summer

Mourinho's case for reinforcements was strengthened when Paris Saint-Germain brought on the Ferrari fuel-injected winger Lucas Moura and the devastating Javier Pastore who both waltzed Bruce Forsyth-like through the Chelsea defence with ease.

Chelsea's reinforcement at that late stage was 35-year-old Frank Lampard, one of the best ever attacking midfield players who was forced on to play a holding midfield role.

The messages were obvious.

Impact: PSG were able to bring on Javier Pastore from their substitutes bench

Ba also looks a shadow of the striker I remember when he first moved over to England from Germany in 2011.

I recall standing on the touchline at West Ham's Chadwell Heath training ground next to Avram Grant watching a training session and one player was catching my eye. He was useless.

A shadow: Demba Ba does not look the same player as the one who arrived in England in 2011

Avram, who is that chap with the bright green size 15 boots on?' I asked. 'Is he a trialist?'

'No Martin, no,' he replied. 'This player is Demba Ba. I have just signed him from Hoffenheim.'

I nodded and smiled, and I looked at Demba's 10-to-2 gait and bright green massive feet. He looked like a duck waddling around.

I thought what an earth has Avram done?

The next day he banged in two against West Brom!

Impact: Ba was a huge hit at West Ham and Newcastle but has failed to fire at Chelsea

In 19 years as a manager in the Football League I've never heard or had anyone mention rigging matches or spot fixing.

Never even had a sniff of it.

I'm sure for all the players who have been arrested it is a very difficult and testing time.

Until proven guilty: Preston North End captain John welsh is one of seven players to be arrested for spot-fixing

But we must remember they are all innocent until proven guilty.

Let them carry on playing and let them continue their lives until it's proven that they have done wrong or not.

Of course it is a concern, but hopefully the investigations that are going on will nip it in the bud, so there are no longer any doubts about the integrity of the game.

Difficult: The players should be allowed to carry on playing and continue their lives until guilt is proven

Talking of integrity, what a mockery it has been made of after Sunderland's fine for fielding an ineligible player was brushed under the carpet and kept secret.

It is simply not enough for them to be handed a hefty fine and a slap on the wrist for playing Ji Dong-Won in four Barclays Premier League matches.

Mockery: Sunderland were only fined after playing unregistered Ji Dong-Won

Even though he isn't the best of players he is still a good one and why can Hereford and Torquay get docked points in League Two back in 2011 and Sunderland escape? That is Mad.

There will be hell to play if they avoid relegation by only a few points.

Not only that, when he shouldn't have played in the Capital One Cup they knocked out my old club MK Dons.

I cannot understand why somebody is not responsible for spotting that error at the time.Think for one moment if they went through instead of Sunderland.

Mad: Hereford and Torquay were docked points for a similar offence in 2011

They would've gone on to play Peterborough in the next round which would've given them a good chance to progress.

And, who knows, they could've then got a tie against a Premier League club, potentially worth millions of pounds.

When the team sheets were sent in for the league cup surely someone must hold their hands up and take responsibility for the error that has been made.And I say 'error' as it is not cheating.

Just to make it clear, I don't feel Sunderland have cheated, but potentially a lower league club could've been cheated out of a lot of money due to the error.

Missing out: MK Dons may have missed out financially because Ji played against them

On Tuesday night last week I faced the dilemma of choosing between Woking versus Forest Green Rovers or Manchester United against Bayern Munich.

One was getting out into the thick of it. The other was putting my feet up on the sofa and sticking the telly on.

There was only one choice for me.

Choice: Going to see Woking and Forest Green was more appealing than staying in to watch United and Bayern

I love the big Champions League games and watching the top players, but the sausage and chips in the board room at Woking before the game and the welcome from the ladies who dish out the tickets and serve the tea and the coffee is different class.

They're proud of the role they play and their love for Woking Football Club through the ups and downs is quite moving.

The banter from the supporters in what must be the oldest shed-like stand in the country was hilarious.

Getting stuck in: The atmosphere at Football League and Non-League grounds is second to none

The one-liners, the stick the 'line-o' got, and the laughs I had throughout the game made my trip to the Kingfield Stadium memorable.

I enjoy the Premier and the Champions League, but I love getting stuck in at Football League and non-League matches.

It's impossible for Fernando Torres to rediscover what he once had - Chelsea should get rid of him

Jose Mourinho was sending a message to Roman Abramovich by not picking a striker in Paris

Those accused of spot-fixing are innocent until proven guilty

Sunderland not being docked points made a mockery of football

And why I decided to watch to choose sausage and chips at Woking over watching Manchester United and Bayern Munich in the Champions League
