Every day for the last two weeks, Huang Huang the dog has repeated the same tragic routine.

Scratching and sniffing from seat to seat, the lonely pooch scours a bus in the desperate yet futile hope of picking up his missing master's scent.

But his master never comes.

In a heart-breaking refusal to face the inevitable truth that he has almost certainly been abandoned, the loyal mongrel has returned to the same bus stop, in Chengdu, southwest China, every day for the past 15.

Heart-breaking: Huang Huang has returned to the same bus stop, in Chengdu, southwest China, every day for the last two weeks and repeats the same tragic routine

Desperate: Drivers say he spends the following ten hours searching every bus that passes, sniffing seats and looking up at owners

Every day he has waited patiently in line for the bus to arrive, boarded with other passengers and then scoured the seats, whimpering as he goes.

Drivers say he spends ten hours every day searching any bus that passes. But finally, as night falls, he gives up and disappears into the darkness, only to return the next day to start again.

According to bus staff interviewed by
 local paper Huaxi Metropolis Daily, Huang Huang has appeared at the 
stop, at the carpark outside the sity's Guangyan temple, consistently 
for the past 15 days.

'Every day I go to Guangyan temple five times, and every day that dog will hop on board my bus to give it an inspection,' a ticket seller named only as Yang told the Huaxi Metropolis Daily. 'At first I thought it was looking for food, but I later realised that it was looking for its owner.'

Help find my owner: Huang Huang has now become something of a local celebrity in Chengdu after one commuter filmed one of his painstaking searches on a mobile phone and posted it online

Lost and not found: A conductor named Fung said he thought he had seen Huang Huang standing with his owner in the car park around a month ago. But he said he had not seen the owner since

And he's has now become something 
of a local celebrity in Chengdu after one commuter filmed his 
painstaking searches on a mobile phone and posted it online.

Though his newfound fame will be of scant consolation to the lonely hound as his owner is yet to be found.

A conductor named Fung said he thought he had seen Huang Huang standing with his owner in the car park around a month ago. But he said he has not seen him since.

He said he has considered taking Huang Huang home with him but so far feels that may be premature.

'We’re worried that its owner might be looking for it and might come back
 to it,' Fung said. 'Such a loyal dog … Who would be willing to part 
with it?

'I can only hope that it’ll quickly be reunited with its owner 
and won’t have to wait here at the bus stop every day.'
