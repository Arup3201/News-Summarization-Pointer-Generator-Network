A Dallas woman abducted at gunpoint to be be sold into the sex trade made a dramatic escape from her captors and alerted the police 24 hours after being kidnapped.

Elia Beltran and her friend Karla Uribe were abducted after leaving Club Rio in West Oak Cliff in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

Before eventually freeing Uribe, the alleged kidnapper, 19-year-old Cruz Alcala turned to Uribe and threatened to shoot 20-year-old Beltran saying, 'Convince me not to kill her.'

Elia Beltran, 20, was abducted at gunpoint from a club in Dallas, Texas and held for 24-hours as her captor tried to sell her into the sex trade

Driving around Dallas in Beltran's 1997 Ford Explorer, which Alcala had also stolen, Uribe said that she and Beltran were pleading for their lives.

'We were just trying to convince him,' said Uribe to WFAA.Com

'You know, 'We have families, please don't do this, you know, if you have a heart just don't do this.'

Releasing Uribe soon after kidnapping her and Beltran, Alcala is then alleged to have met up with Alicisa Faye Morris, 23, Jermaine Jackson, 36, and Telvin Pratt, 22.

Jermaine Jackson, 25 (left) and Telvin Pratt, 22, are accused of trying to co-opt Elia Beltran into working as a prostitute for them at gunpoint

Once with them, police have said that he attempted to sell Beltran to them as a prostitute.

Beltran managed to escape while at a gas station in the 1700 block of West Main Street in the suburb of Grand Prairie.

While one of the suspects checked a tire, Beltran ran to the neighbouring Golden Chalet Motor Inn where she raised the alarm in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

The 20-year-old is said by police to be traumatised by her experience but thankful to be back with her family

Her kidnappers abducted Beltran in her own 1997 Ford Explorer and dumped it in woods as the police closed in to arrest them

'The caller indicated that she was a kidnapping victim from Dallas. She indicated her captors were nearby and escaped,' said Detective Lyle Gensler of the Grand Prairie Police Department.

'They were not only able to locate her, but the three people she escaped from,' said Gensler.

Her 1997 Ford Explorer was found abandoned near to where the arrests were made and now police specialist victims units are working with her to piece together a case against her alleged kidnappers.

'She was very emotionally distraught over the incident that happened that day,' said Gensler.

'We were able to calm her down.

'My heart and soul goes out to her and her family.

'She's going to be emotionally scarred over the event.

'Itâ€™s not really a happy ending.'
