VITAL STATISTICS 

It's all about location here - and design. Overseen to within an inch of its life by Philippe Starck, you'll find plenty of his trademark white, undulating design but with a Brazilian bossa-nova touch for warmth - tree trunks act as bedside tables, there's some eclectic modern furniture and rich browns and gold tones thrown in.

There are just 89 much sought-after rooms, all stuffed with high-tech designer touches. When the sun is out, however, everyone heads to the roof and its white marble swimming pool and bar, and ensconces themselves on the sunloungers - although the hotel does have a private area on the beach as well.

Perfect spot: Step out on to your balcony and you'll be rewarded with views along Ipanema beach

Keeping it low key: David Beckham was another famous guest who stayed at the hotel during the World Cup

Now the owner of four hotels in South America, the Fasano family started their empire with a famously good restaurant, and food still matters here.

While the hotel specialises in Italian-style seafood, Lady Gaga ordered a huge number of burgers - then asked that they were given to her fans camped outside the hotel.

LOCATION REPORT 

On Ipanema Beach. Turn left and you'll reach Copacabana, but Ipanema is smaller, safer and, more importantly, hipper. Step out on to your balcony (and everyone does, even members of One Direction and Lady Gaga) and you'll be rewarded with views along the beach and into the mountains. Lady Gaga made her sentiments clear by hanging an 'I Love Rio' banner on her balcony.

David Beckham preferred a more low-key approach, slipping into the hotel quietly. The rooms on the lower floors can be noisy.

Making a splash: The Fasano has become the most stylish address in Rio de Janeiro

KEY ATTRACTION

Rio's coolest hotel by far, with a steady stream of celebrities wanting to experience its charms. Above all, they come for the rooftop that's reserved for hotel guests - One Direction spent most of their free time here. 

A chance to see the sun set is an excuse for a nightly pool party. However, unlike many fashionable hotels, the Fasano prides itself on getting service right - it's very much down-to-earth. All guests are given a pair of flip-flops on arrival to get them into the Girl From Ipanema vibe.

IN THE NEWS

Coleen Rooney holed up here for the World Cup during the summer. One Direction brought Ipanema to a standstill in May when they stayed.

GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE REST OF US? 

Even if you can't afford a room, non-residents can book in for an albeit expensive meal at the Al Mare restaurant or have a drink at the Baretto Londra - a little bit of Blighty in South America, with leather sofas, Union Jacks and very strong caipirinhas.
