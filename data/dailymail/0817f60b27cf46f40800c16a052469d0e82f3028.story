A cancer patient who was forced to have a section of his upper jaw removed has been given an entirely new set of teeth built by a 3D printer. 

The 41-year-old man, from Bangalore, India, was left unable to eat or speak properly after undergoing the operation when he was diagnosed with mouth cancer. 

It also left him with large gaps in his teeth that made him feel self-conscious about his appearance.

New smile: The 41-year-old patient was left with gaps in his teeth, left, following a surgery to treat mouth cancer. A team of scientists were able to give him a new set of teeth, right, to fill in the top row

Realistic: A picture of the mould of the man's mouth, built using a 3D printer, reveals how closely the scientists were able to match the shape and colour of the new set to the patient's original teeth

Self-conscious: The man, from Bangalore, first sought help from dentists to try and fix the gap in the roof of his mouth, left, caused by the surgery. Right: His smile shows the 3D-printed teeth built by scientists

Solution: As well as losing a number of teeth, the patient had a section of the roof of his mouth and part of his jaw removed. Above, the areas that were rebuilt in the 3D printer are coloured to look like his natural mouth

But he is now able to use his mouth with greater ease after a team of scientists used a 3D printer to model and build the section of his jaw that was removed.

The patient  had to undergo the surgery in order to remove the cancer in the roof of his mouth. 

He experienced further complications after developing radiation-induced lockjaw following six weeks of radiotherapy treatment.

The condition, which limited his ability to open his mouth, affected his eating and his speech. The upper jaw surgery also had a severe impact on his appearance. 

Dentists were reluctant to give him any sort of implant, as taking an impression and producing a mould proved problematic given his inability to open his mouth.

But a local company that specialises in 3D printing for healthcare became involved in the patient's case.

Digital solution: As the man was unable to fully open his mouth to allow doctors to take a conventional mould, a CT scan was used to create a 3D reconstruction of the patient's face, pictured above

Next step: The model of his jaw, pictured above, was able to simulate the movements of his joint and mimicked the mouth opening fully. This allowed the scientists to make sure that he would have a full range of movement

Perfect fit: Using the 3D-printed replica as a template, a wax model was produced and adjusted to make sure that it would fit the patient as comfortably as possible. Above, part of the 3D-printed jaw is seen

Treatment: Osteo3D, a Bangladore-based company that specialises in 3D printing for healthcare, became involved in the patient's case after dentists said he could not be fitted with a dental implant

Using a CT scan to create a 3D reconstruction of the patient's face, the company, Osteo3D, printed a replica of the patient's mouth, complete with lower and upper jaw, the defect and his teeth.

The model was able to simulate the movements of his joint and mimicked the mouth opening fully - overcoming the issue of making a mould from the patient's jaw. 

Using the 3D-printed replica as a template, a wax model was produced and adjusted to make sure that the fit was correct.

This was then hardened, fitted with teeth and given to the patient. He is now able to chew, swallow, speak and smile with greater ease.
