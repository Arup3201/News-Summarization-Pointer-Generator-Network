The couple made the announcement on the official Ismaili website on Friday 

American supermodel Kendra Spears earned her title, Princess Salwa Aga Khan, when she married the eldest son of billionaire racehorse owner, His Highness Aga Khan IV, in 2013

'Expressing his greatest happiness, Mawlana Hazar Imam informed the Jamat today that Prince Rahim and Princess Salwa are expecting their first child. Around the world, Ismailis are gathering in Jamatkhanas to celebrate the happy news.'

The 25-year-old earned her royal title when she married Prince Rahim Aga Khan, 42, the eldest son of billionaire racehorse owner, His Highness Aga Khan IV, last September.

Prince Rahim studied in the U.S. at Brown University and the Navarra Business School in Barcelona, Spain and is involved in the poverty reduction efforts of the Aga Khan Development Network.

His father, the Aga Khan, a British national, is the 49th hereditary Imam of Ismaili Shi'as, and is regarded by his followers as a direct bloodline descendant of the prophet Mohamed.

After an engagement of only four months, Kendra and Prince Rahim exchanged vows at the Bellerive Castle in Geneva, Switzerland.

Hailed as the 'next Cindy Crawford,' Spears has an impressive modelling resume as well as a B.A. in sociology from the University of Washington

The Seattle-born beauty, who was 24 at the time, wore a stunning ivory sari with gold embroidery to marry her husband in a traditional Muslim ceremony. 

Although styled 'Prince' or 'Princess', the Aga Khan is actually a religious leader and the imam of a Shi'a sect known as Imami Ismā'īlī Tariqah or Nizari Ismailism.

Currently held by Prince Shah Karim Al Husseini Aga Khan IV, the title has been used since 1818 and was first bestowed by Persian (now Iran) ruler Fath-Ali Shah Qajar on Hasan Ali Shah, the 46th Iman of the Nizari Ismailis.

Like the role of Imam to the Nizari Ismailis, the title is passed from father to son through a family which is are claimed to be directly descended from the Prophet Mohammed's cousin and son-in-law, Ali.

The current Aga Khan is Prince Shah Karim Al Hussaini Aga Khan (IV), a British business magnate and racehorse breeder, who took the title at 20 after the death of his grandfather Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah Aga Khan III.

He is considered one of the world's wealthiest people with a fortune in excess of $800m, part of which comes from a tithe paid by Ismaili Muslims called a 'dasond' - the equivalent of 12.5 percent of each person's gross annual income. 

News of the pregnancy comes just over a year after the wedding, and marks the continuation of the long royal line. 

The statement on the official website also states: 'Aitmadi Mahmoud Eboo, Chairman of the Ismaili Leaders' International Forum, has submitted a message of congratulations to Mawlana Hazar Imam and the entire Imamat family, and also conveyed warmest wishes to Prince Rahim and Princess Salwa on this very happy occasion.'

The union of Kendra and Prince Rahim, reportedly worth around $800m, was the culmination of a fairytale story for the Seattle-born beauty, who rapidly rose to fame after winning an online modelling contest.

Hailed as the 'next Cindy Crawford,' Spears has an impressive modelling resume - in fact, she and Prince Rahim were reportedly introduced by fellow supermodel Naomi Campbell.

But this beauty has brains too - she obtained a B.A. in sociology from the University of Washington.

It was only after graduating that she was discovered via MySpace by Ford Models.

She landed a contract with Ford Models and made her debut at New York Fashion Week in September 2008.

Her career lifted off in 2009, when she appeared on the covers of French ELLE, Chinese Vogue, and Dazed & Confused.

She has also appeared in campaigns for Diane von Furstenberg and Prada and walked for Calvin Klein, Chanel, Lanvin, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy, among many others.
