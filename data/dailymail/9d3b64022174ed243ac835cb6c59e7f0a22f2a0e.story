Thousands of babies are suffering from eczema, vomiting and colic because doctors are failing to recognise they are allergic to cow’s milk, a new campaign claims today.

Too many GPs are ignorant about the condition and write off symptoms as nothing serious, according to the charity Allergy UK.

But it can leave children needing treatment for weeping eczema, sores, reflux, vomiting, facial swelling and breathing difficulties.

And even mothers who exclusively breast-feed run the risk of cow’s milk proteins being passed to their baby through their own milk.

Not to be confused with lactose intolerance, cow’s milk allergy (CMA) occurs when the body launches an immune response to the protein in cow’s milk. Lactose intolerance is caused when the body is unable to digest the sugar in milk.

On average, it takes five months for CMA to be correctly diagnosed, research by the organisation found. Nathalie Dyson-Coope, 33, said she had to take her son Callum Newman to see medics nearly 50 times before he was finally diagnosed with CMA.

‘When he was born, I exclusively breast-fed him and for the first eight weeks he was fine,’ said the NHS administrator from Buckinghamshire. ‘But after that, his symptoms started to appear.’

At 12 weeks, Callum was admitted to hospital with severe eczema, his skin so sensitive that hugging him would leave him in pain. It was only at 16 months, and after many visits to A&E, that he was allergy-tested.

Allergy UK and Mead Johnson Nutrition, which makes prescription-only infant formula for CMA sufferers, found many GPs underestimate how common the condition is. A third believe it affects just one in 10,000 babies – or 70 a year – when the actual figure is nearer one in 20, or 35,000 annually. In one in three cases, parents end up taking their babies to A&E because of undiagnosed CMA.

Dr Neil Shah, who sees hundreds of cases at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: ‘There is an awareness issue with GPs and all doctors about CMA and, in fact, there is still some disbelief that it exists at all.’

A spokesman for Allergy UK – which has launched the website isitcowsmilkallergy.co.uk – said: ‘Undiagnosed CMA leaves infants in distress and puts families through unnecessary anxiety.’

A spokesman for the NHS Trust that treated Callum said: ‘It can be difficult to confirm a diagnosis of allergies as the symptoms could be caused by other factors.’
