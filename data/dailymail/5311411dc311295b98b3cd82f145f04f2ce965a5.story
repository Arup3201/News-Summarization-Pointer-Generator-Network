Taylor Smith does not have to strain her memory to recall her mother's last words - because she had them etched into her skin.

Smith, 20, a student at Central Michigan University, posted a photo on the popular site Tumblr displaying a tattoo on her arm consisting of the words: 'I Love you Be good!! - Mom' 

Next to the tattoo the 20-year-old placed a folded page from a lined notebook with the same words written in her mother's hand.

Message of love: Taylor Smith, 20, posted a photo on the site Tumblr displaying a tattoo on her arm consisting of the words from her late mother's last note to her: 'I Love you Be good!! - Mom'

Smith wrote beneath the photo: 'It's on my left forearm. It’s a note my mom left me the night she died. Here's a side-by-side-by-side shot of the two.'

The touching image went viral on the site, with more than 410,000 'likes' and 'rebloggs.' 

In response to numerous queries from curious Tumblr users, Smith explained in a post on the site that her mother passed away suddenly in February 2011 from what was believed to be a heart failure.

At the time she had written the note, Smith said that her mother had no idea she was going to die later that same night.

According to the college student, on the day of her mother's passing, her parents headed to the family's cottage for the weekend to celebrate their anniversary.

Smith, who lives in an apartment near the CMU campus, wrote that she came to her parents’ home to watch their dog while they were away.

She explained that her mother loved leaving notes for her, and since she did not get to the house in time to say goodbye to her parents before they hit the road, she was not surprised to find the handwritten missive from her mom. 

'The note was expected but the importance of it wasn’t because she didn’t know it was essentially her last good-bye,' Smith wrote.

The daughter went on to say that later that night, her mother went to sleep, and never woke up, leaving her with those six little words to hang on to and cherish for the rest of her life. 

'It was very sudden and unexpected so the note is even more important to me because when she wrote it, she was just saying goodbye for the weekend,' Smith wrote.

In another post on Tumblr responding to users' questions about her unique tattoo, Smith, who has three other tattoos, noted that her brother and sister tried to dissuade her from inking their mother's last words on her arm, but she has been getting a lot of positive feedback about the unusual body art from other people.

From her Instagram and Tumblr accounts, Smith emerges as a well-adjusted, bubbly young woman with a quirky sense of humor and lots of interests.

She shared online that she is majoring in emotional impairment special education and English.

When she is not in class and writing papers, the 20-year-old works in CMU's physics department as a secretary, and also has a second job as a cashier in a Kohl's department store.
