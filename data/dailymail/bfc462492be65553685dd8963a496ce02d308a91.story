Arrested: Tiquana Pasco has been charged with child endangerment after leaving her toddler in a car

A Missouri couple who rescued a toddler who had been left alone in a parked car in temperatures of 90F claim the child's mother attacked them.

Jeremy Welch and his wife were leaving a Kansas City restaurant when they saw a young girl sweating while strapped in a car seat in an empty vehicle.

But as they lifted her out of the car and carried her back to the restaurant, the child's mother, Tiquana Pasco, rushed over and tried to stop them.

Welch said that a small crowd had gathered around the car, where the two-year-old child had allegedly been left unattended at about 7pm on Monday.

After a quick search to try to find the girl's parents, he called 911 and his wife lifted the child out of the unlocked car.

It was while another witness was giving the girl some water that Pasco came out of the GameStop store she was in, and demanded to know what was happening.

'She’s like, "Why are you touching my child, why do you have my child?" She [Welch’s wife] explained, "well, you left your child unattended in this hot car, so I took her out",' he said.

Welch claimed that the woman then began 
slapping and hitting him and his wife, and pulling at her child after 
they told her they had called the police.

'She
 continued to shove at me and slap me and push me to try and get around 
me, and I just stood in her way and told her she couldn’t have her child
 back until the police got there,' Welch told Fox 4.

He helped carry the child into a nearby Chipotle so she would cool down in the air conditioning. Witnesses say the little girl vomited several times.

Pasco, 29, has been charged with child endangerment. Her daughter, who was checked by medical staff, was found to be unharmed by the incident.

According to KSHB, the arresting officer said the mother was 'belligerent and not following commands [he] gave her.'

She later told police she had left her daughter in the car for less than five minutes while she went into the store, because she was asleep.

After her arrest, Pasco alleged told police: 'I was totally wrong for leaving her in the car.'
