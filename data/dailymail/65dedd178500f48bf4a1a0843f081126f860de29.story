Shipbuilding in Portsmouth is to end after more than 500 years, putting hundreds of jobs at risk, it emerged today.

BAE is to consult on 1,775 potential job losses, including 940 in Portsmouth and a further 835 in Glasgow, Rosyth and Filton, near Bristol.

MPs and council leaders in Portsmouth reacted with fury to the decision, claiming jobs were being lost in England to protect Govan and Scotstoun on the Clyde ahead of the vote on Scottish independence.

Blow: Shipbuilding in Portsmouth will come to an end after centuries of maritime history

An announcement was expected tomorrow, but was brought forward to today.

Shipbuilding will come to an end at Portsmouth in the second half of next year. 

In a statement BAE said: 'Following detailed discussions about how best to sustain the long-term capability to deliver complex warships, BAE Systems has agreed with the UK Ministry of Defence that Glasgow would be the most effective location for the manufacture of the future Type 26 ships.

'Consequently, and subject to consultation with trade union representatives, the company proposes to consolidate its shipbuilding operations in Glasgow with investments in facilities to create a world-class capability, positioning it to deliver an affordable Type 26 programme for the Royal Navy.'

In the Commons Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said that every effort would be made to redeploy workers, and that compulsory redundancies would be kept to a minimum.

'The loss of a shipmaking capability will be a harsh blow to Portsmouth,' he added as he announced that more than £100 million will be invested in the city's naval base so it can accommodate new warships.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond admitted the loss of shipbuilding would be a 'harsh blow to Portsmouth'

But the announcement was attacked as a politically motivated 'act of lunacy' by one of Portsmouth's Conservative councillors.

Alistair Thompson said: 'This is devastating for the workers and their families but also for all those people involved in the supply chain that keeps the dockyard working.

'Many of those who I represent as a councillor are hugely concerned that this decision has been taken for political reasons because of the referendum in Scotland next year.' 

Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth City Council, condemned the decision to shut down the last remaining shipyard in England with the capability to build advanced surface warships, saying it was bad news for the defence of the UK and for the Royal Navy.

'The remaining yards with the capability to build advanced warships are in Scotland, and the referendum on Scottish independence is less than one year away. Ministers have put the defence of the UK and the future of the Navy at real risk,' he said.

Blow: Workers leave BAE Systems in Govan, Glasgow after hearing the defence giant is to axe 1,775 jobs across its naval ships business

The cuts are being made following a decline in orders, with 1775 jobs going between the yards in Scotland, including Govan (pictured) and England with the end of shipbuilding altogether at the Portsmouth yard

Shipbuilding work will be moved to the shipyard in Govan, where the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier has been built

The Ministry of Defence will pick up the bill for moving the work to Scotland.

BAE added: 'The implementation of these restructuring activities will sustain BAE Systems' capability to deliver complex warships for the Royal Navy and secure the employment of thousands of highly skilled employees across the UK.

Workers in Portsmouth are likely to feel their jobs have been sacrificed to shore up yards in Scotland ahead of next year's independence referendum.

Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'These are decisions taken in the UK's national interest.'

Asked whether the desire to encourage Scots to vote No in next year's independence referendum had played any part in the decision, the spokesman said: 'This is a Government that always takes decisions based on the national interest.

'This decision was taken with a view of how we have the best-equipped, best-maintained Royal Navy. That is the basis on which it was taken.'

He insisted Portsmouth would remain the 'home of the Royal Navy fleet' with 'world-class shipbuilding of Royal Navy ships continuing on the Clyde'.

Livelihoods: Workers at the BAE Systems shipyard in Govan, Glasgow. As many as 1,000 jobs may be lost at three of the company's UK shipyards amid fears there will be no new work once two aircraft carriers are finished

The grim news was given to workers at a series of meetings at 11am across the affected sites, before they were allowed to go home for the rest of the day.

David Hulse, GMB national officer and chair of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions' (CSEU) shipbuilding national committee, said: 'There is no doubt that this is a devastating day for the UK shipbuilding industry and the company will have justify to us the job losses planned.'

Steve Murphy, general secretary of construction workers union Ucatt, said: 'Once again workers have found out that their jobs are under threat through the media. It is highly distressing and extremely unfair to treat a loyal workforce in such a way.

'This is a highly skilled workforce, so it is absolutely essential that the Government and BAE Systems minimises job losses, guarantees the long-term future of all the shipyards and continues to invest in training the workers of the future.'

Some of the jobs set to be lost at the Portsmouth, Govan and Scotstoun shipyards may be offset by a contract to build a new Royal Navy carrier, the Type 26 Global Combat Ship.

The MoD announced it is to commission three new ocean-going offshore patrol vessels for the Royal Navy, to be built by the BAE yards on the Clyde in Scotland.

The deal provides work for the company between the completion of the current aircraft carrier contract and the start of the Type 26.

The Prospect union voiced its 'deep concern' over the loss of so many skilled shipbuilding jobs and has called for an urgent meeting with ministers and the company.

Deputy general secretary Garry Graham said: 'For an island nation and in this time of increased global uncertainty, we should be seeking to maintain our shipbuilding capacity, not reduce it.

'Shipbuilding is not only a key element of our defence infrastructure, it is also an industry where the UK should be a world-leader, creating and sustaining highly skilled and well-paid jobs.'

Johann Lamont, Labour's leader in 
Scotland, said the referendum had created uncertainty and delayed 
decisions about the future of the two yards on the Clyde.

'For me, of course, I’m not arguing 
Scotland to leave the UK, I want Scotland to stay part of the UK and I 
want the jobs in Portsmouth shipyard because these are highly skilled 
jobs and a very effective workforce and as defence workers in my 
constituency have highlighted to me, they’re concerned of the 
uncertainty the referendum has brought about.

'That’s why there’s a delay about this. We don’t want to see the workforce across the United Kingdom set against another.

'And in fact, the power and strength 
of the United Kingdom is that we can pool resource and we can manage 
these things in a different way,' she told BBC Radio 4.

Vernon Coaker MP, Labour’s shadow defence secretary, said: ‘There will be huge anxiety amongst the highly skilled workforce, their families and the communities they live in.

‘This has significant consequences for the future of shipbuilding in the UK and has implications for the future defence of our country.’
