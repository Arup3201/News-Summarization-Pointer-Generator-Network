An innocent van driver faced death threats after being wrongly named on Twitter as the person responsible for mowing down 14 people in a hit-and-run rampage.

White van man Jason Clowes, 32, has told of his hell after false rumours that he was the driver of the vehicle which hit mother-of-three Karina Menzies.

Father-of-two Mr Clowes was wrongly blamed on internet sites including Twitter and Facebook as being the driver in Cardiff.

Online: A Facebook group as been started apologising to Jason Clowes which has attracted nearly 900 'likes'. Mr Clowes wrote on the page: 'Thanks to the people who have said sorry'

Mr Clowes - who lives less than half a mile from the scene of the carnage on the Ely estate - said: 'I had people sending me threats saying they were going to kill my kids.'

Mr Clowes hit out at the power of internet gossip and thinks he knows the person who started the rumour that he was the driver of the vehicle which went on a three-mile trail of terror.

It is believed that the confusion began because Mr Clowes drives a white van and lives in the area.

After the rumour went online, it snowballed in minutes and before long the media had got wind of his name. 

He said: 'People phoned me up and said: 'We heard you have been driving in a transit van and running people over.'

'I didn’t know what it was all about. People were saying I had been driving around in a transit but I was out fishing with my mate Ken.'

Mr Clowes family had reporters calling at his home as the rumours spread and police even took the unusual step of confirming he was not at the wheel.

He said: 'I could not understand the accusations - why were people naming me? I just want people to know that they need to concentrate on this poor family and the victims.

'I’m holding no grudge. It’s no good holding grudges - it just eats you away. But I want people to know I was wrongly accused and didn’t do anything wrong.

'It is just the way of life these days. I knew I was innocent and had nothing to worry about.'

Mr Clowes said he was relieved that a Facebook page has been set up to apologise to Jason.

The site called: 'An apology to Jason Clowes from the people of Ely' has hundreds of supporters.

Mr Clowes added: 'People have been amazing with their apologies.'

His mother Dawn Clowes, 51, said she was appalled at the false rumours.

She said: 'There were death threats and things. I felt sick. The police phoned me about the death threats. My mind went blank and I thought: “He’s not like that.

In the dock: Matthew Tvrdon spoke in a soft Welsh accent as he appeared in court charged with the murder of Karina Menzies and the attempted murder of 13 others earlier this week

Operation: Police are the scene in Cardiff last Friday. Mr Clowes was mistaken for the alleged driver

'I could not believe he was being named. I’ve not got a clue why they said it was him, except that he drives a white van.

'He phoned me and said: “It’s OK, I’m safe”. I had spoken to the police as well. They said Jason was not the man.

'Why can’t people stop the gossip?'

Matthew Tvrdon, 31, has appeared in court charged with murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.
