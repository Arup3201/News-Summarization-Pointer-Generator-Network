It’s well known that Isis are violently anti-Western – but not, it seems, when it comes to fast food.

In the terrorist group’s Iraqi stronghold of Mosul it’s possible to eat US-style burgers and fries, courtesy of a burger joint.

‘Big Burger’, which can be found in the north of the city by the Tigris River, in the Elarabi Quarter, serves a variety of meals.

Super-sized: Big Burger offers its customers the option of having large fries, just as fast food restaurants in the West do

‘Big Burger’, which can be found in the north of the city by the Tigris River, in the Elarabi Quarter, lets its customers eat inside, or al fresco

It’s possible to order a chicken sandwich, cheeseburger and Mexican-style fillings, as well as Western soft drinks such as Sprite and Coca-Cola. 

Customers can eat their meals al fresco, or inside, on tablecloths adorned with the words 'fast food', in English.

The restaurant appears to be very popular, with an average score of 4.2 out of five from 201 reviews on its Facebook page, which has nearly 3,000 ‘likes’.

The fact that the terrorists allow the restaurant to operate may surprise some. The group mete out extreme punishments to people who embrace Western habits, even executing those they deem to have strayed from their strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.

Earlier this year, for instance, 13 teenage boys were shot dead for watching the Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan last week.

Isis declared that they'd broken religious law by watching the game.

And this week it emerged that Isis terrorists have blown up the Mosul Public Library, sending 10,000 books and more than 700 rare manuscripts up in flames.

Leading members of Mosul society reportedly tried to stop the fanatics destroying the building, but failed.

The director of the library, Ghanim al-Ta'an, said that the extremists used homemade bombs in the attack, which took place on Sunday.

He told Middle Eastern website Geran: 'ISIS militants bombed the Mosul Public Library. They used improvised explosive devices.'

Presumed destroyed are the Central Library's collection of Iraqi newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire and book collections contributed by around 100 of Mosul's establishment families.

Mosul blogger Rayan al-Hadidi, according to The Fiscal Times, said: 'Nine hundred years ago, the books of the Arab philosopher Averroes were collected before his eyes... and burned. One of his students started crying while witnessing the burning. Averroes told him... the ideas have wings... but I cry today over our situation.'

Isis first invaded the Central Library in January. Residents say the extremists smashed the locks that had protected the biggest repository of learning in the northern Iraq town, and loaded around 2,000 books — including children's stories, poetry, philosophy and tomes on sports, health, culture and science — into six pickup trucks. They left only Islamic texts.

'These books promote infidelity and call for disobeying Allah. So they will be burned,' a bearded militant in traditional Afghani two-piece clothing told residents, according to one man living nearby who spoke to The Associated Press.

The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation, said the Islamic State group official made his impromptu address as others stuffed books into empty flour bags.
