Anthony Joshua has joined Wladimir Klitschko's training camp as he helps the heavyweight world champion prepare for the latest defence of his titles.

Klitschko takes on Kubrat Pulev on September 6 in Hamburg when all four of his belts will be on the line.

And he invited his fellow Olympic super-heavyweight champion to spend 10 days as a sparring partner in Austria.

Determined: Klitschko will face Kubrat Pulev on September 6 as he defends his heavyweight world titles

Joshua, who has won his first seven fights as a professional inside the first two rounds, returns to action a week after Klitschko, in Manchester.

He told BoxRec: 'For me, there’s levels. I know where I’m at. I definitely know where he’s [Wladimir] at. I’m going to get some valuable experience from this.

'I’m sparring at a level I’m not used to. I’ve got nothing to prove. It’s sparring. You can’t take too much away from sparring. But I’ll walk away from here with the experience.

'I’m getting a feel of what it’s like with the champ. I’ve not sparred with a lot of people bigger than me physically. I measure myself against guys like Fury and Chisora.'

Klitschko, who at 38 is 14 years Joshua's senior, won Olympic gold in 1996 while the Brit followed suit 16 years later.

Klitschko has held a version of the world title since 2006 but faces a stiff challenge against the unbeaten Pulev.

The 33-year-old from Bulgaria earned his shot by outpointing Tony Thompson last year.
