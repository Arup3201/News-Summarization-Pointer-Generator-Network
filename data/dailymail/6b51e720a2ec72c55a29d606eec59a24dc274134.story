Casey Anthony’s clothing and personal items are now being sold on a controversial website that caters to crime scene enthusiasts and people obsessed with her murder trial.

The items are on sale for $800 apiece to buyers seeking so-called 'murderabilia,' a term used for collectibles related to murders, murderers and violent crimes.

The macabre hobby has been forced underground for the last decade after eBay banned the sale of murderabilia in 2001, but business is reportedly booming.

Yours for $800: For the price of a high-end designer handbag, a buyer could own this used black purse that allegedly belonged to Casey Anthony

The items that purportedly belonged to
 Casey Anthony being sold for such exorbitant prices include several 
pairs of capri pants, checkered shorts and handbags.

Florida-based Serial Killers Ink is selling the items that are said to have originated from a garage 
sale held at the Anthony family home on June 28 last year.

Anthony was acquitted of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee in
 2011.

‘We are proud to offer for sale a number of items believed to be worn by Casey Anthony, one of the most notorious figures in American criminal history,’ says Eric Holler, the owner of Serial Killers Ink.

‘Casey Anthony may not have been convicted of murder, but she has become a pop culture icon, right up there with Jodi Arias and Myra Hindley.’

According to reports, Casey’s parents George and Cindy Anthony held the yard sale, charging neighbors for secondhand clothes and toys.

An onlooker, Christina Werner told reporters, ‘I drove by and noticed the house looked familiar to me, I had seen this house before. I got close and noticed that the people outside really looked like George and Cindy Anthony. It was the home of Casey Anthony’s grandparents.’

Collectors items: Patterned shorts and a colorful drawstring bag that allegedly belonged to Casey Anthony are, according to Eric Holler, 'important historical artifacts'

At the sale, pink and purple heart-shaped lockets, tiny combs and teddy bears were among the children’s items hawked for prices as low as $1.00.

Now the items are available to buyers who are apparently willing to pay big money for creepy murderabilia - or in the case of Anthony's possessions, cheap cotton pants and used handbags.

According to Holler, there is still a huge demand for personal items associated with Anthony even though she remains in hiding and has been staying out of the public eye.

‘There are private collectors who will pay big money for any memorabilia surrounding the case,’ he says.

'These items will be displayed at conventions and in museums. They are important historical artifacts.’

Odd fascination: Collectors are willing to pay $800 to own an item of clothing Casey Anthony, acquitted of murdering her toddler daughter, may have once worn

Anthony’s trial gripped the nation, and she served prison time after a jury convicted her of lying to investigators.

Collectors
 of murderabilia seek artifacts used or owned by murderers. Weapons used
 in crimes and clothing worn during the perpetration of crimes is of 
particularly high value, but anything is marketable.

Other highly sought-after items include poetry or artwork created by the disturbed minds of killers, known as 'killer art.'

Serialkillersink.com regularly sells 
autographs, artwork, documents, locks of hair, photos and clothing from 
killers such as Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, 'Night Stalker' Richard 
Ramirez, and 'Killer Clown' John Wayne Gacy.

Eric Holler says, 'I don't condone their crimes. But I have a right to sell these pieces. Business is booming.'

The recent sale of the artwork of George Zimmerman on eBay for $100,000 could be said to be in violation of eBay's ban on murderabilia.

The ghoulish market for clothing, letters and art created by serial killers has been slammed by victims charities, which claim the trade destroys the dignity of crime victims.

In recent months, Holler has even cashed in on dirt, taken from the home where Cleveland Strangler Anthony Sowell buried 11 victims, selling it for $25 a gram.

The business has stirred controversy in the past by offering for sale art by John Wayne Gacy, including a piece called ‘Single Witch’ that sold for $1000.

Gacy was known as the ‘Killer Clown’, and was convicted of the sexual assault and murder of more than 33 teenage boys and young men. The website has also sold art and letters written by Charles Manson, Richard Ramirez, and Ted Bundy.

Anthony will not benefit from the sale of the clothes, and it will not help her financial situation after filing for bankruptcy in March. Currently unemployed, Anthony claimed she is not receiving any money in book and TV deals, and is living on the kindness of strangers.

Holler says the items have been laundered, and that no personal items of Caylee Anthony, including toys, are being offered for sale.
