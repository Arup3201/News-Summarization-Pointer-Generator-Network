It's known as the home of heroic outlaw Robin Hood - so it's fitting that one of his band of legendary Merry Men should make an appearance in the trees of Sherwood Forest.

Walkers spotted what looks like a bowed figure sitting under a snow-covered tree in the famous Nottinghamshire forest - with Facebook users now claiming that he looks like Friar Tuck.

The unusual shape was spotted in the trunk of the much-loved 1,000-year-old Major Oak - once voted Britain's favourite tree - after heavy snowfall blanketed the forest earlier this week.

'Monk on a trunk': An unusual figure, likened to Robin Hood's companion Friar Tuck, has appeared in the famous Major Oak tree in Sherwood Forest

Likeness: The figure in the tree has been likened to Friar Tuck, one of folk hero Robin Hood's band of Merry Men, seen here played by Phil Rose in the television programme Robin of Sherwood

A worker at the Sherwood Forest Nature Reserve, Paul Cook, took a picture of the tree and uploaded it onto the Nottinghamshire County Council Facebook page.

Since then, local residents have flocked to the page to discuss whether the unusual figure looks like Robin Hood's trusted companion or other figures such as former Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

But it's likeness to Friar Tuck and the forest's connection with the legendary outlaw have seen the figure dubbed 'Monk on a Trunk'.

Paul said: 'Being so familiar with the legend of Robin Hood with Sherwood Forest being his historic home, we would dearly love it to be an image of Friar Tuck.

'I just wanted to take some images of the snowfall and got more than I bargained for once the image appeared on Facebook.

'I did not initially notice anything unusual when I first posted it up, but when you look closely at the picture the outline of what appears to be a monk does appear to be sitting at the base of the tree - the resulting discussion on the county council's Facebook is now very exciting indeed.'

Famous: The 1,000-year-old Major Oak which sits at the heart of Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire and was once voted Britain's favourite tree

One resident, Ken Wood, commented on the picture: 'It sorta resembles the way a Fryer would Tuck himself down beside a tree and observe all of nature!' (sic).

The tree is visited by thousands of people each year and has become popular with couples getting married.

Because of its age a fence has been put up around Major Oak to stop visitors' feet from compressing the ground above its roots in the hope that it will keep the tree healthy for years to come.

The Major Oak is a Quercus Robur, the English or pendunculate oak and in a 2002 survey was voed Britain's favourite tree.

Local legend suggests that Robin Hood and his men used its hollow trunk as a hiding place.

Beautiful: The picturesque Sherwood Forest is not only known for its association with Robin Hood but also as an area of outstanding beauty

It weighs around 23 tonnes and has a trunk circumference of 33 feet and a 92 foot branch span.

The tree has been known by several names over the centuries including the Cockpen Tree and the Queen Oak.

It became known as the Major Oak after Major Hayman Rooke included it in a popular book about the ancient oaks of Sherwood written in 1790.

Coservation work has been carried out on Major Oak since 1908, with metal chains initially used to support the branches, replaced by wooden struts in the late 1970s.

Thin steel poles now prop up its branches.
