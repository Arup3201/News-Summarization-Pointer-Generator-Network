Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas has shown his life is great on and off the pitch at the moment.

The Spanish international, a £30 million summer acquisition from Barcelona, has been in impressive form on pre-season for the Blues.

He’s now been reunited with his glamorous girlfriend Daniella Semaan, posting on Instagram: ‘Back home with my baby @4ladyd.’VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cesc Fabregas scores first Chelsea goal with free-kick

The 27-year-old has returned from Germany where Chelsea slumped to a surprise 3-0 loss to Werder Bremen on Sunday, the side’s first pre-season defeat of the summer.

Fabregas has been signalled out for high praise from Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho who believes the summer signing is the missing piece in his Chelsea puzzle to win trophies this season.

Mourinho said: 'He can accelerate the intensity of the game or he can reduce it. He's very intelligent and he has goals. We are so happy and all the players have a fantastic feeling around him as they really feel that he sees football too fast, too fast.

'I always thought Cesc would be a Barcelona player because he is so good and being a Catalan and with the end of Xavi's career coming. When we heard the information he'd decided to come back to London we knew he was the one we wanted.

'His football brain is what we need in our team. I see him everywhere. His best quality is the speed of how he analyses the game and executes. It is difficult for him to lose the ball or make the wrong decision.

Mourinho has bolstered Chelsea’s squad for the upcoming campaign with Filipe Luis, Didier Drogba and Diego Costa all joining Fabregas at the Blues.

The Chelsea boss is particularly impressed with Fabregas’ versatility he brings to the squad.

'He can play as a No 10 and score or a No 8 and give most of his game to the team as we have [Nemanja] Matic as anchorman and [John Obi] Mikel. Then we have Oscar and Willian as No 10s. Cesc is both, he is the missing piece of our engine.'
