They say opposites attract, and psychologists agree.

According to research, couples who are too similar to each other, both physically and in personality, are less likely to have a long lasting relationship than those with some distance between them.

The theory matches many seemingly perfect Hollywood marriages which failed to last, from Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor to Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston.

But research by personality experts suggests the secret is not being too close to each other but as close as makes you happy - even if that means being very different.

Those annoying couples who seem to agree with each other all the time may find they are actually too close for comfort, said the study by Columbia University in the United States.

Observers often noted that Burton and Taylor seemed so similar in fiery personality that they appeared to find it as hard to live together as they did to live apart.

And Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston seemed so well matched they even seemed to look alike at one point, yet the relationship failed to last.

Its public health department conducted three years of psychological profiles on 732 adult men and women for the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,

They were questioned on their relationships, levels of intimacy, overall satisfaction, closeness to their partner, how often they thought of breaking up, commitment and depression.

How close they are to their partner was measured in a test commonly used by psychologists which is called 'Inclusion of Other in Self'.

It looks at how much two people share personality traits, values, identity and points of view among other aspects of their life together.

Added together, researchers claim they could use the information to compare the closeness of couples against their happiness and the strength of their relationship.

The couples with the strongest relationships were those that were neither the closest nor the most distant but somewhere in between.

Tellingly, these couples knew they were not as close as they could be but they were happier this way, said lead author Professor David Frost.

He said: 'It's not how close you feel that matters most, it's whether you are as close as you want to be, even if that's really not close at all.'

And he warned: 'People who yearn for a more intimate relationship and people who crave more distance are equally at risk of having a problematic relationship.

'If you want to experience your relationship as healthy and rewarding, it's important that you find a way to attain your idealised level of closeness with your partner.'

Feeling either too close or not close enough will see a relationship weaken and eventually break up, he added.

And the concept could be extended beyond romantic relationships and into those between parents and children, co-workers or simply friends, he said.
