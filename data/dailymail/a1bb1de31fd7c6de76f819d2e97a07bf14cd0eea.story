Marks and Spencer has been criticised for selling a range of body toning creams called ‘Fat Girl Slim’.

The products, including anti-cellulite cream and a stomach-toning gel called ‘six-pack’, have been accused of targeting 'insecure women' by campaigners in Brighton, West Sussex.

M&S insisted the name, which is by independent firm Bliss, was simply a light-hearted play on the name of DJ Fatboy Slim, aka Norman Cook.

Complaints: Marks and Spencer has come under fire for stocking a 'sexist' range of beauty products by another firm called Fat Girl Slim. Resident Frances Joseph said: 'I'm pretty shocked and disappointed'

Variety: The products include a stomach toning gel called 'six pack' and a moisturiser called 'arm candy'

But a shopper lodged a formal complaint with the manager of M&S's Western Road store in Brighton, citing the rate of eating disorders among young girls.

Others urged the firm to stop stocking the goods.

Brighton resident Frances Joseph, 41, urged customers to sign a petition which was started more than a year ago calling on Bliss to end its range entirely.

She said: 'Many of us agree that this is deeply inappropriate branding for a cosmetics range. 

'I’m pretty shocked and disappointed that M&S of all people would choose to stock this brand. 

'There’s a clear implication that tummy cream will help to give you a six-pack, another product will give you toned arms and so on.

'They are overtly targeting insecure young women.

Ms Joseph said: 'There’s a clear implication that tummy cream will help to give you a six-pack, another product will give you toned arms and so on. They are overtly targeting insecure young women. It's exploitative'

M&S responded on Twitter: 'This is part of our Bliss beauty range; the products play on the popular DJ's name and aren't intended to cause offence'. Bliss, which produces the range, has been asked for comment

'It’s really exploitative, dangerous and sad.'

The products are also available from Bliss' website and include a moisturiser called Armcandy for £34 and a 'lean machine' for £120.

Ms Joseph also complained to Marks and Spencer on Twitter.

The firm responded: 'This is part of our Bliss beauty range; the products play on the popular DJ's name and aren't intended to cause offence.'

A spokesman later said: 'This product range is part of independent beauty brand Bliss and is not intended to cause offence to our customers.'

According to its website, Bliss began in 1996 with a spa in New York and later started marketing its treatments online and in shops. Its Fat Girl Slim range is thought to have existed for at least three years. 

Bliss has been contacted for comment.
