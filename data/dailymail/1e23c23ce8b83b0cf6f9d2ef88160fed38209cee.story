A triple killer has won an £800 payout because some of his belongings – including nasal hair clippers and a carton of cranberry juice – were damaged or lost in jail.

Kevan Thakrar, 26, won £500 of the sum because officers did not apologise for the incident, which he claims left him ‘stressed’.

Thakrar used a machine-gun to murder three men in a suburban home over a £10,000 drug debt and was jailed for 35 years in 2008.

Behind bars, the gangster slashed three guards with a broken bottle. He is regarded as one of Britain’s most dangerous prisoners.

While he was being transferred from one prison to another, some of his possessions were misplaced.

A pair of nasal hair clippers, a stereo and an alarm clock were  damaged, while personal papers, a carton of cranberry juice and some protein powder were lost. The killer claimed he was ‘stressed’ by the damage to the clippers, while some of the lost items were ‘priceless’.

A judge ordered prison bosses to pay him £314.97 – as well as a further £500 to make up for the lost possessions and for failing to give the apology he demanded.

Thakrar has since boasted on Facebook about a plan to send bailiffs to collect his cash from the Ministry of Justice.

The payout provoked fury among his victims, including one of the prison officers stabbed by Thakrar.

Craig Wylde, 32, who lost eight pints of blood after the attack, said the claim was laughable. He added: ‘It is another case of the prisoner getting everything and the real victims getting nothing.

‘He is always trying it on. This is the sort of person he is. He has to complain about everything and thinks he’s a big man because he’s challenging the system. This latest claim will have cost thousands and thousands of taxpayers’ money. It is just totally pathetic.’

Thakrar killed three men with a Mac 10 machine-gun in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire. He would have shot two women as well, but his gun ran out of bullets – forcing him to use a knife.

He and his brother Miran, then 24, made Keith Cowell, 52, his son Matthew Cowell, 17, and Tony Dulieu, 33, kneel on the floor, then shot them in a revenge plot over a cocaine deal.

A 23-year-old woman was stabbed six times as she tried to protect her daughter, and another woman was hurt. Thakrar was jailed for three counts of murder, two of attempted murder and a firearms offence.

Behind bars he soon became a serial complainer, repeatedly bringing cases against the prison authorities. This is the second time he has successfully claimed for lost or damaged property.

In 2012 he won an apology from the 
prison ombudsman after authorities failed to investigate an alleged 
attack on him by guards, and in 2010 he claimed that prison staff wrote 
false entries on his files.

The same year, he attacked three officers with a chili sauce bottle after barricading himself in his cell.

Mr Wylde lost eight pints of blood when the jagged glass severed a major artery.

 shouted, ‘I’m going to kill you’, and stabbed a second officer, Claire 
Lewis, in the back. A third officer tackled him, and Thakrar slashed his
 face.

He was charged with attempted murder, but cleared by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court. He argued that he had acted in  self-defence, as a pre-emptive strike after  suffering years of alleged racist bullying.

As a result of the incident, he was transferred from Frankland prison, in County Durham, to Woodhill in Milton Keynes.

In the move, some of his property was lost or damaged, and a prison ombudsman awarded him £10 in compensation.

But Thakrar took the case to court and, in September last year, District Judge  Neil Hickman ruled that he was entitled  to a further payout.

The judge said that there had been an ‘outrageous delay’ of 13 months in paying the £10 proposed by the ombudsman.

He said it had ‘all the appearance of a calculated gesture’ by the Ministry of  Justice, and criticised the fact that no apology had been made.

Thakrar at first claimed to have lost £100 of goods, but later upped this estimate to £230.01. The judge awarded him £90 for loss of property – on top of the £10 from the ombudsman – and £224.97 for the  damaged items.

He also awarded an extra £500 because prison bosses refused to say sorry.

He said: ‘Had the defendants said promptly and sincerely to Mr Thakrar that they deeply regretted the loss of his personal items and understood his distress, the loss of them would not have been aggravated in the way that it has been.

‘The Ministry has steadfastly failed even to tender the grudging and belated apology recommended by the ombudsman.’

Thakrar still updates his Facebook page from one of Britain’s top security prisons.

In his most recent post on the social  
networking site, he gloats about his money, and reveals that he 
attempted to send bailiffs to collect it from Justice Secretary Chris 
Grayling.

He describes formally applying for a court enforcement order, before adding: ‘Although it may have been a few months late, Grayling paid up. It is a shame though – I was quite looking forward to the bailiffs going into the Ministry of Justice.’

By contrast, Mr Wylde has yet to learn if he will be compensated for his injuries.

Last night, a Prison Service spokesman said: ‘We robustly defend all cases as far as the evidence allows.’
