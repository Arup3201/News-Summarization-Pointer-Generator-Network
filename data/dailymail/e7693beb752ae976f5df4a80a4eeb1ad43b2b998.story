David Coulthard has questioned Lewis Hamilton’s focus on the eve of the new Formula One campaign.

Hamilton is the favourite to defend his championship with Mercedes expected to hold a clear advantage over the rest of the field when the season gets underway in Melbourne in the early hours of Sunday morning.

The 30-year-old Briton has brushed shoulders with a host of A-List celebrities during the off-season as he continues to expand his profile outside of the sport.

The Briton faced the media in the first pre-race press conference of the year ahead of the Australian GP 

He is also close to signing a new deal with Mercedes which will see him earn a considerable amount more than the current £20million-a-year contract he signed after leaving McLaren in 2012.

Meanwhile, his private life has also been the subject of much discussion following the break-up of his relationship with long-term girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, the American popstar who was in Abu Dhabi to celebrate his second world championship last year.

‘Lewis appears to be going through a transition in his off-track life,’ said Coulthard, a 13-time race winner. ‘I see he is negotiating his own contract, doing music in the future and has split up with Nicole, and all of these things have an influence on your life which may be a positive or negative.

‘It will be interesting to see now that he has won two world titles, is a wealthy champion, and got lots of opportunities, whether the absolute focus is still on the job.’

Rosberg will renew his title battle with Hamilton 

Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg are set to go toe-to-toe for the world championship once more after the dominant Mercedes pair won 16 of the 19 races last season during a frenetic campaign.

Hamilton clinched the title in dramatic circumstances at the season finale in Abu Dhabi with his 11th victory of the year.

But Coulthard expects the German, who tasted victory just once after his collision with Hamilton at the Belgian Grand Prix in August, to return stronger this term.

‘Nico now has the experience of battling for a world championship,' added Coulthard. 

'He went into last year with a good car, everything was going great, then he had the collision in Spa, his team told him he was a bad boy, and he was getting booed by the fans.

'There were so many first-life experiences for him and a lot of things he had to go through. 

'I think he will be stronger. He is settled in his life, he is married and he has got a baby coming later in the year.’

The F1 season kicks off with the Australian GP on Sunday 15 March. Watch highlights on BBC One at 13.15, listen live on Radio 5 live and follow all the action on the BBC Sport website.
