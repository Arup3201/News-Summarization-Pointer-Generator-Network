Three female RAF recruits have each been paid £100,000 in  compensation by defence chiefs – for injuries caused by marching like men.

The women said parading in step with male recruits for several weeks forced them to lengthen their stride too far - resulting in spinal and pelvic damage.

Their claims were settled earlier this year following a five-year legal battle with the Ministry of Defence, which accused them of exaggerating their symptoms.

Critics condemned the ‘compensation culture’ within the Armed Forces and blamed the case on an ‘obsession with gender equality’.

The payouts are bigger than many of the lump sums paid to soldiers shot on the front line in Afghanistan.

Former defence minister Gerald Howarth told the Mail on Sunday: ‘This case is completely and utterly ridiculous - it belongs in the land of the absurd.

‘The defence budget is strapped and we’re making 20,000 troops redundant, yet these former recruits are being paid six-figure sums.

‘The MoD must stand up to the compensation culture and get the wider public on its side. If the RAF has erred in its training procedures it is because of society’s obsession with gender equality.’

In settling the case, the MoD accepted it had failed to follow guidelines about stride lengths for men and women, and made the women carry the same heavy packs as male recruits.

RAF policy states that women should not have stride lengths longer than 27in, and should be at the front of a march to set  the pace.

The female recruits, who were aged 17, 22 and 23 at the time, were forced to stretch their strides to 30in during basic training at RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire.

They have been compensated for nine years of lost earnings and  pensions - despite all reportedly having successful careers outside the military.

The payouts came as the Armed Forces’ compensation bill for 2012/13 topped £108.9million - up £21million on the previous financial year. One of the recruits, Tracie Davies, said she was in agony within a few weeks of starting training in 2006.

‘The guys were over 6ft tall so I was over-striding to march in step with them,’ she said. ‘When I started getting pains in my groin I was told to march through it, even when I was carrying a heavy pack which was almost the size of me.

‘I trusted the medics to know better than me so I carried on marching. But eventually I couldn’t take any more and burst into tears.’

An X-ray found that she had four separate pelvic fractures. She added: ‘I was put on crutches and sent home on sick leave. My fractures didn’t recover sufficiently for me to complete basic training and in 2008 I was medically discharged.’

At the time she was given £3,000 in compensation by the military but later sued. A spokesman for  the Ministry of Defence said it had ‘legal liability’ to pay compensation in some cases, and had changed its training practices to ensure the problem didn’t arise again.

‘When compensation claims are submitted, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the Ministry of Defence has a legal liability to pay compensation,’ she said.

‘Where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we do so. The RAF takes the welfare of it recruits very seriously and has reviewed its recruit training practices to mitigate against this risk.’

In 2007, the MoD paid £484,000 to an RAF typist who injured her thumb at work. The woman, then in her 20s, claimed it caused her to become depressed.

Her award was almost double what a soldier would have received at the time for losing both his legs in the course of duty.
