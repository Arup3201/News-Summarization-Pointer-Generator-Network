Lockdown: Simon Turner was appalled when police allowed his bike to be stolen from under their noses

A cyclist whose bike was stolen was flabbergasted when bungling police stopped him from taking it back - and then let the thief ride off on it.

Simon Turner, 48, spotted his bicycle chained up on a busy high street as he shopped with his six-year-old son, Giles.

But after he approached a Police Community Support Officer in his home town of Maidenhead he was told not to break the lock and retrieve his stolen bike.

The PCSO told him it was not his property and the crook would be able to sue him if he took it.

Mr Turner was told police would monitor the area using CCTV and catch the criminal.

But the next day he heard the thief had slipped through their fingers and had walked off with his bike for a second time.

Two men, who could not be identified, had unlocked the bicycle and taken it away from the high street in Maidenhead, Berkshire.

Mr
Turner said: 'I'm absolutely appalled. The worst thing was, when we 
found the bike, we had to explain to Giles why we had to leave it and 
let the thief get it.

'He was scared that maybe his bike would be stolen as well.'

The father-of-one's black and burgundy Universal bicycle - which was stolen from his shed in early August - had cost him £55 second hand, and he had made various improvements.

When he saw it chained up outside a McDonald's in the town centre later that month, he even offered the PCSO £5 to pay to replace the lock so that he could get his bike back. But he was advised that the thief could sue for damage.

Seeing red: Frustrated Mr Turner had to sit back while the bike was pinched for a second time

He said: 'I gave details of a hidden technical modification. She looked and there it was, clearly proving it was my bike.

'I said I'd go home and get some tools and remove it but they said we couldn't remove the bike.

'They said, "you'll be damaging the lock and it's not your property".

'The PCSO was taking advice from another officer over the phone and was just as incredulous as I was.'

Mr Turner, who runs a home tuition company, then had to sit back and wait while the police allowed the thief to get away.

'I was tempted to hang around and see who came to take it back but I was with my son and it wouldn't have been practical,' added Mr Turner, who lives with wife Anu in Maidenhead.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'The PCSO was acting on the 
advice of a colleague and we've yet to establish exactly what happened.

'However, it does appear the incorrect advice was given to her and there
were other steps that could have been taken at the time.

'We'd like to apologise for this mistake and reassure the gentleman 
concerned that we are doing all we can to track down the person or 
people who stole his bicycle.'

The Citizens Advice Bureau advises that 
police can seize goods if they have reasonable grounds for believing 
they have been obtained illegally, or are evidence in relation to an 
offence.
