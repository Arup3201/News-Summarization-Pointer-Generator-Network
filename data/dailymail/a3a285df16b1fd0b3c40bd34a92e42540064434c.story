The French girlfriend of injured Formula 1 driver Jules Bianchi last night  sent out a prayer through Twitter for her 'champion' as he fought for his life in a Japanese hospital.

Camille Marchetti, 24, led tributes to the 25-year-old Marussia driver after he span off a rain-soaked track and into a recovery vehicle clearing up an earlier crash in the Japanese Grand Prix yesterday.

Unconscious but breathing for himself, Bianchi was taken to Mie University hospital, ten miles from the track in Suzuka, and the race was stopped nine laps early. Bianchi's father, Philippe, has since told French television that his son's condition is 'critical' and he has undergone surgery for serious head injuries.

Mr Bianchi and wife Christine are understood to be travelling to Japan to be with their son. It is not yet known if Miss Marchetti is going with them.

But last night, Miss Marchetti, who has dated Bianchi for a number of years, led prayers for the race ace's recovery as the world waited for news on his condition.

'You are my champion! You are the strongest,' she wrote on Twitter, ending the tweet with emoticons of a heart and two hands locked in prayer.

Her prayer comes as Bianchi's Marussia team asked for 'patience and understanding' as it released a statement thanking people for the 'huge outpouring of support and affection for Jules and the team at this very difficult time'.

It continued: 'With regard to the communication of information concerning Jules' medical condition, we will respect and be guided by the wishes of the Bianchi family.

'Together with Jules' care, they will remain our highest priority.

'Therefore, we would ask for patience and understanding with regard to further medical updates.'

Bianchi is a graduate of the Ferrari academy and former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa and team principal Marco Mattiacci went with him to hospital. 

It is the most serious accident to hit a race weekend since Felipe Massa fractured his skull and spent a week in a coma while qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix, in 2009.

Officials immediately red-flagged the Suzuka Grand Prix, meaning championship leader Lewis Hamilton claimed his third win in succession and eighth of the season.

But celebrations on the podium were muted after news of Bianchi's condition broke.

'It's obviously a real anti-climax to hear that one of our fellow colleagues is seriously injured so that's really the main worry,' Mercedes' race winner Lewis Hamilton told the BBC.

'You could see some commotion and the car was really badly damaged on the right. We just hope he's OK.'

He said: 'Our first thoughts go to Jules - it overshadows everything else when one of our colleagues is injured and we are praying for him.
