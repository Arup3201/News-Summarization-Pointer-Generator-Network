Steve Smith hit a sublime century as Australia reached the World Cup final with an imposing 95-run victory over reigning champions India on Thursday.

The 25-year-old hit 11 fours and two sixes as he made 105 as the co-hosts posted a daunting 328  for 7, despite suffering a mid-over collapse. 

India’s response never materialised and although MS Dhoni made a run-a-ball 65 Australia always looked in control with Mitchell Johnson (2-50) and James Faulkner (3-59) bowling India out for 233.

In a sport dominated by statistics there were plenty that were pointing towards a home victory with India having beaten Australia just once in 13 previous meetings at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

With the sub-continental side having continually suffered at the hands their opponents since arriving in the Southern Hemisphere in late November, Australia looked strong favourites.

But Dhoni, India’s exceptional if not a somewhat underrated leader, ensured the world champions rose to the occasion of defending their crown and the result of the semi-final was far from a foregone conclusion.

Having won the toss, it came as no surprise that Michael Clarke chose to bat – opting to put runs on the board and attempt to apply pressure on India.

The rejuvenated Indian pace attack began aggressively and the build-up of early pressure saw David Warner lose patience and send a leading edge off Umesh Yadav to Virat Kohli at cover.

It brought Smith, India’s kryptonite over the past four months, to the crease and he provided further evidence as to why many view him as the man to lead Australia in the near future.

Despite the pressure of the situation Smith never looked fazed and having weathered an early storm of short-pitched deliveries he punished one Yadav over for four fours.

Meanwhile, at the other end Aaron Finch was struggling to time the ball but Smith’s ability to attack and keep the run-rate rising allowed his partner to find his feet.

After becoming just the second Australian player, after David Boon, to score four successive World Cup half-centuries Smith finally made his maiden World Cup century.  

In the first over of the batting powerplay, the right-handed batsman hit three boundaries, the last a four pulled from outside off that saw him complete a 89-ball ton.

The match seemed to be swerving dangerously out of reach for India with their bowlers continuing to offer short-pitched balls that were being dispatched to the stands.

But, Dhoni brought back Yadav (4-72) and the eerily quiet SCG erupted as Smith attempted to hook a short ball and saw a top-edge fly to Rohit Sharma at deep square leg for 105 off 93-balls.

As Smith walked off the SCG the Indian fans were relieved to see the back of the outstanding batsman, who has plundered 921 runs in 10 innings this summer against them.

Having broken the 187-run second-wicket partnership India looked to go on the attack but all-rounder Glenn Maxwell was equal to task, hitting three fours and a six in a quick-fire 23.

As Maxwell departed Australia were faltering and Finch, who had grafted his way to 81, was the next to go - caught at mid-wicket by Shihkar Dhawan - having become increasingly frustrated at a succession of dot balls.

Captain Clarke (10) quickly followed him back to the hutch with Mohit Sharma claiming his first wicket as India slowly began to claw the match back to an even keel.

Though Smith, Finch and Clarke were all dismissed by the short ball, the Indian bowlers were guilty of relying on it far too much and Shane Watson and Faulkner cashed in late on to push Australia past 300.

A cameo from Johnson (27 not out) took the co-hosts to 328-7 as India conceded 89 in the final 10 overs.

If India were going to finally win their first match in Australia this summer they needed to get off to quick start.

Rohit was lucky not to be dismissed for a duck in the first over off Mitchell Starc as he drove a fuller ball to Watson at slip only for it to be adjudged to have just fallen short.

Fellow opener Dhawan then enjoyed his own bit of luck as he danced down the track to Josh Hazlewood but wicketkeeper Brad Haddin dropped a big outside edge.

The second lives for both batsmen was gleefully accepted and the pair put on a 76-run first-wicket partnership as India looked to make inroads into the substantial target. 

But Hazlewood soon had his man as Dhawan (45) looked to have timed his shot perfectly only to pick out Maxwell at deep extra cover.

It was a desperately required wicket for Australia and three overs later India’s star batsman Kohli was dismissed by Johnson for just a single.

The 26-year-old has scored 13 centuries in victorious chases for his country but failed to add to that in Sydney, as he top-edged a bouncer high into the sky and straight into Haddin’s gloves.

Knockout matches bring about a unique pressure and the impressive Indian batting line-up collapsed from 76 without loss to 91 for three. as Rohit was bowled - via an inside edge - by Johnson for 34.

In their previous seven matches in the World Cup, at least one of India’s top-five batsmen have scored a half-century or a hundred to anchor their side’s innings.

But as Suresh Raina departed for an 11 ball seven and India were wavering on 108 for four, the task of taking India to victory again rested on the shoulders of Dhoni.

Ajinkya Rahane shared an important 70-run fifth-wicket partnership with his captain before Starc has him caught behind off the slightest of edges on review.

Smith continued to affect the outcome of the match and with the required run-rate rapidly rising, reaching over 13 with 10 overs left, as he ran-out Ravindra Jadeja for 16.

On 40 occasions in which the 33-year-old has finished unbeaten when his side was chasing, Dhoni has taken them to triumph 38 times.

Having prodded his way to 47 off 54 balls, the Indian captain smashed the recalled Watson for successive sixes.

But Dhoni’s innings was eventually ended as Maxwell, with one stump to aim at, ran the Indian captain out 65.

India had not lost more then seven wickets in their previous seven World Cup matches and the previously unexposed tail were quickly dismissed.

Faulkner bowled Ravichandran Ashwin (5) and Shami (0) in successive balls before Starc wrapped up the innings, bowling Yadav for a five-ball duck, with 19 balls spare.

Australia have now won all seven semi-finals they have featured in and the impressive victory has set-up a mouth-watering final against the unbeaten New Zealand in Melbourne on Sunday.
