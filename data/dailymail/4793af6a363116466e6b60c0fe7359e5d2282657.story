For those who have ever fancied themselves as a James Bond villain they would be in 007 heaven living in this town - inside an active volcano crater.

Budding Blofelds or Dr. Evil's might want to consider the real estate options buying a home on Aogashima Island, off the coast of Japan.

Situated in the Philippine Sea the tropical rarely-visited volcanic island is just over 200 miles south of Tokyo.

Surrounded by rims which are 650-1300m in height, the island itself is a giant volcanic crater, and within that crater there’s another smaller volcano

The entire island is classed as a Class-C active volcano by the Japan Meteorological Agency and the last eruption in 1781 some 170 of the 327 islanders died. It took just 50 years for the people to return and today it's home to 205 brave inhabitants.

Today a small town still exists based inside the steep cliffs of the volcanic crater in a bizarre similarity to the classic bases of many film baddies.

Visitors can access a sauna at the centre of the island unsurprisingly powered by geothermal gas. 

The steam produced by the volcano provides free heating, hot water and cooking for all on the island. 

The small island is just over 1.5 miles wide and 2.1 miles long with the highest elevation being 1,388ft high

Photographer Yasuhito Izuki, 40, from Saitama, Japan, spent three days on the island taking these amazing pictures.

Web designer Yasuhito enjoys travel writing as a hobby and decided to visit the volcano after being fascinated people still lived inside a volcano.

He said: 'Despite the volcano the people living there are living just as an ordinary Japanese, they fish and have agriculture and of course look after tourists. 

'Unlike the James Bond villains they are not plotting world destruction but have lived there in some cases for generations.' 

According to geologists the island was made from the remains of four underwater volcanoes and the cliffs surrounding the island were formed by volcanic deposits

Steamed potatoes and eggs are one of the Aogashima specialities, they are cooked in the steam produced by the volcano

It takes 40 minutes to get to Aogashima by helicopter which runs only once a day, otherwise you can take a boat which takes two hours from nearby Hachijo-jima

The island is barely reachable by boat as it has no real harbour to anchor boats due to steep rugged cliffs surrounding the island. The only other option to get there is to take a helicopter which runs only once a day. 

'Travelling to Aogashima can be difficult even in modern Japan, there is a one-way airfare of around 15,000 yen (£87) or you can travel by boat for around 8,000 yen (£46) to the nearby island of Hachijo-jima.' Yasuhito says.

'From there it takes around two hours by boat or 40 minutes by helicopter to get to the island.'
