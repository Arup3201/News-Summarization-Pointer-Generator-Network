Taxpayers will have to fork out a staggering half a million pounds to fix four panes of glass in the building housing MP’s offices.

Private discussions have been held about how to cope with the latest - and most expensive - setback at Portcullis House, the modernist glass ‘atrium’ adjoining Parliament which opened in 2001.

It has emerged that MPs have approved £488,000 for temporary repairs to the damage, almost half of which will be spent on a ‘feasibility study’.

Taxpayers will have to fork out a staggering half a million pounds to fix four panes of glass in Portcullis House, the modernist glass ‘atrium’ adjoining Parliament which opened in 2001

A permanent solution in the coming years could take the bill way past £1million.

The glass structure houses the offices of some 200 MPs and their staff, modern committee rooms and a vast seating area with a canteen, restaurant and meeting area.

Its’ construction ran to £235million after massive over-spending, and the building has been plagued by scandals from persistent cracks in the glass to the £400,000 cost of renting 12 decorative fig trees.

But the most expensive repair to date has been approved this year, after one of the damaged panels of glass crashed to the floor nine months ago, fortunately not injuring anyone.

It is understood from House of Commons sources that around £38,000 was spent on making the pane safe.

Another £210,000 is being spent on a temporary replacement for it and three other cracked panes.

Finally, £240,000 has been approved for a ‘feasibility study’ by construction experts to work out how much a permanent solution to the roof problems will cost.

During rainy weather last week, large red buckets had to be placed on the floor outside the staff canteen where the panels fell in March.

Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris, who sits on the Public Accounts Committee said: ‘It is astonishing to find that this problem is going to cost so much to fix.

‘A very unwelcome Christmas present for both the Parliamentary authorities and the taxpayer’.

Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Portcullis House increasingly looks like a black hole for hard-pressed taxpayers’ cash.

‘At a time when we’re trying to find savings everywhere else across government, spending a quarter of a million on a ‘feasibility study’ seems like a waste of money, especially on top of the cash already frittered away on forestry and fig trees in the building.

‘The Parliamentary Estate employs an army of maintenance officials and engineers and it shouldn’t require extra administration or bureaucracy to work out a permanent solution.

‘Politicians talk a lot about fixing the roof when it comes to the economy, but when it comes to taxpayers’ cash it needs to be done as cheaply as possible.’

Portcullis House was designed by award-winning architects Michael Hopkins and Partners and was opened by The Queen 13 years ago.

Officials were criticised after some £13million was lost to one of the contractors which sued Parliament over a deal to supply wall and window units.

Then cracks appeared almost immediately and a section had to be replaced in 2005 for £100,000.

More damage was discovered in 2008 and again in 2012, apparently due to hot summer weather, and anti-shatter film had to be applied to parts of the glass to stop shards falling on staff.

A report from the Parliamentary Director of Estates just after the pane crashed in March and released under Freedom of Information rules, recommended repair work straightaway.

It said: ‘A design team is being assembled to fully investigate the unique structure and design of the Atrium roof and propose any necessary long term remedial measures.

‘This is likely to be a major undertaking.’

MPs on the Commons Administration committee have - after meetings with Parliament officials - been asked to approve the costly work and feasibility study.

A House of Commons spokesman said: ‘In order to identify and mitigate the risk of future damage to the Portcullis House roof, a professional specialist team is currently undertaking a detailed examination of all glazed units…and will determine the nature and potential costs of any remedial measures that may be required.

‘As we are always committed to achieving value for money for the taxpayer, the investigation will also identify the most cost-effective means to maintain the roof in future. Any implementation of remedial work will follow the normal ‘business case’ process.’
