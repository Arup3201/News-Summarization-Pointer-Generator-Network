Haunting and poignant, these previously unpublished First World War pictures capture the bloody conflict in Italy like never before.

The images and documents are on display at Italy's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, commemorating the war's 100th anniversary.

The exhibit features images of executions and emaciated prisoners of war that were censored during wartime, as well as notifications for military tribunal death sentences that were posted on the streets of Rome.

It also includes videos, letters and diaries that detail the horrors of trench warfare. 'Now we are like beasts that are hunted,' wrote a 37-year-old Italian corporal.

'You go to the slaughterhouse without realising it.'

Much of the material was discovered in government archives through a re-cataloguing process that began in 2006.

Franco Marini, head of the national anniversary committee, said that the war, which mobilised millions of soldiers from all over the country, was instrumental in constructing the nation's identity after Italian unification in 1861.

'They came from completely different realities,' he said. 'It was three years, not just 15 minutes, three years that they lived together, day and night, sharing the same dangers.'

An interactive iPhone and iPad app allows visitors to learn more about the history behind the photos during their visit.

Marini said the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was a particularly apt location for the exhibit because it 'is the emblem of the great sacrifices made during the world war.'

The exhibit runs till July 30.

When war broke out in the summer of 1914, Italy declared itself neutral in the conflict, despite its membership in the so-called Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary since 1882.

Over the course of the months that followed, Italy and its leaders weighed their options; wooed by both sides, they carefully considered how to gain the greatest benefit from participation in the war.

The decision to join the fray on the side of the Allies was based largely on the assurances Italy received in the Treaty of London, signed in April 1915.

On May 23, 1915, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. The Italian declaration opened up a new front in World War I, stretching 600 kilometers - most of them mountainous - along Italy's border with Austria-Hungary.

By the time fighting ended on the Italian front on November 4, 1918 - a week before the general armistice - 615,000 Italians had been killed in action or died of wounds sustained in First World War.
