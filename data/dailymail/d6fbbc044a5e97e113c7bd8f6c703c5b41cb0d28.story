There was finally some good World Cup news for England last night.

Sadly, it did not come from Brazil, where our footballers’ have lost their first two qualifying games.  

Instead, it was at the rugby Junior World Championships in Auckland, New Zealand, where England’s Under-20s triumphed over South Africa to retain the title they had won in France last year.

In action: Tom Woolstencroft of England makes a break during the final of the Junior World Championships

Yesterday’s game ended 21-20, with a nail-biting finish which would have been familiar to football fans – except that it ended with our team’s victory.

Commentators praised England’s defence and attack, with tries from our promising young players Nathan Earle and Joe Conlon as the team came from behind to beat the South Africans.

Jubilant Gloucester fly-half Billy Burns, who scored two penalties and a conversion for England, said after the match: ‘Absolutely buzzing.

'Obviously that last 20 minutes was real nail-biting and to get through it is a massive achievement and full credit to the boys, we deserved that.

Winners: Woolstencroft fends against Andre Esterhuizen of South Africa. The nail-biting game - held in Auckland, New Zealand, finished in a 21-20 victory for England

‘We’ve worked hard all campaign, it’s been tough but to come through and win something like that at the end of it just shows how hard we’ve worked, so it’s real satisfying.’

Burns is the younger brother of Freddie Burns, who is due to line up for the senior England side in the third Test against the All Blacks in New Zealand, today.

His father’s side have lost the first two Tests.

Their success came as England crashed out of the world cup.

Fans were left in ruins once more after Costa Rica upset the odds by beating Italy 1-0 - condemning Roy Hodgson's men to an early World Cup exit.

In their worst performance in the tournament since 1958 - losses to Italy and Uruguay in their first two fixtures mean they will be leaving Brazil before the knockout stages.

Their future in the tournament was left hanging by a thread last night after Luis Suarez led the South American side to a 2-1 win in Sao Paulo - leaving England bottom of Group D.

Their fate was still in the balance today, but Bryan Ruiz's 44th minute header led Costa Rica to a shock 1-0 win against the Italians.

A victory for the Azul would have given England a glimmer of hope going into their final fixture - but the result leaves it mathematically impossible for them to qualify.

The nation has spent months watching football-themed adverts, seeing streets and shops taken over by St George's flags, and hearing hours of punditry explaining why this could be England's year.

But after just two group games in Brazil, Three Lions fans were left with that all too familiar feeling of anti-climax this morning, as they woke to hangovers following yet another night of bitter disappointment.

Celebration: England players take pictures in the dressing room retaining their title

Former captain Rio Ferdinand accepts a 'naive' England did not deserve to stay in the World Cup, but is confident the young squad will grow stronger from the disappointment of Brazil 2014.

'The World Cup for me would have been a better place with England in it, but you have to earn the right to stay in a tournament. Unfortunately for us, we have not done that, Ferdinand said on BBC One.

'Maybe we were a bit naive in situations, in the game yesterday when we got back into it at 1-1, we had a chance to get a point and dust ourselves down, to say 'right, we are ready for the last game when everything is going to be on it,' but we did not give ourselves the opportunity.'
