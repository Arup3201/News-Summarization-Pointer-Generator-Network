A 37-year-old German tourist who crashed his drone into a freshwater lake in Yellowstone National Park while trying to film the area has been sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation, fined $1,600 and banned from the park for 12 months.

YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK ? In a first-of-its-kind federal prosecution, a German national who crashed a drone into Yellowstone National Park's Lake Yellowstone has received one year of unsupervised probation as well as a one-year ban from the park, 9Wants To Know learned.

Andreas Meissner, 37, operated an unmanned aircraft ? known as a Phantom 2 ? over the marina at Lake Yellowstone on July 18. The drone crashed shortly after takeoff after appearing to suffer power loss. The drone and a video card located inside an attached GoPro camera were eventually recovered by a diver 10 days later.

Andreas Meissner pleaded guilty to three federal charges last week following the incident on July 18 and narrowly avoided a jail sentence in Germany.

The National Park service had banned all drones from their parks system in June after numerous complaints they were disrupting patrons and posed a risk to the delicate surrounds.

The prosecution is being called a first of its kind, with at least two other drone pilots facing similar charges, according to 9 News.

Meissner 
was operating a craft - called a Phantom 2 - over Lake Yellowstone when 
the drone crashed into the water following apparent power loss.

He
 was caught after asking park officers for help in retrieving his drone 
and the GoPro camera and SD camera attached to it, which were all 
recovered 10 days later by a diver.

The National Park Service seized the equipment, which has not been returned to Meissner.

Pristine: Andreas Meissner crashed his drone into the water of Yellowstone Lake in Wyoming in July. The lake is the largest freshwater lake above 7,000 ft (2,100 m) in North America

Meissner
 told officials he was shooting video for a German nonprofit called and 
Run and Ride for Reading as part of a push to organize a charity bicycle
 ride across America.

However prosecutors claimed Meissner did not disclose his intentions when he entered the park.

Meissner appeared via telephone from Germany in a federal courtroom inside Yellowstone National Park during the hearing last Wednesday.

He pleaded guilty to three charges, with the US Attorney's Office dropping a fourth charge of giving a false report to a government employee, 9 News reported.

Because his probation sentence is unsupervised, Meissner will not have to check in with U.S. officials.

He was also ordered to pay $1,600 in fines and was banned from Yellowstone National Park for one year.

Brilliant: National Park Service 
officials worry that a drone that crashed into the Grand Prismatic 
Spring in AugustÂ  could damage the delicate balance of bacteria that creates at 
beautiful color

In August, another tourist crashed their
 drone into Yellowstone's Grand Prismatic Spring, with park rangers 
fearing the craft could damage the spring for years to come.

The hot springs owes its brilliant array of colors to a delicate balance of bacteria and algae mixing with special minerals in the harsh environment.

The drone - which is yet to be recovered - could upset that balance, officials said.

The operation of drones - a relatively new technology - has forced park's across the country to bring in new restrictions.

'We had not seen any significant activity (of drones) until this summer,' Yellowstone spokesman Al Nash told MailOnline.

'This is a new phenomenon for us in Yellowstone.'
