A Cleveland police officer has recounted the emotional moment he found Amanda Berry alive outside the house of horrors where she was kept in chains for a decade.

Anthony Espada wrote in a police report that he and his partner with the first officers to arrive on scene after Berry broke out of the house on Seymour Avenue and called 911 for help.

'It's her,' Espada's partner exclaimed when he saw Berry, who went missing from a nearby neighborhood in April 2003.

The call from officers was received by veteran police dispatcher Jennifer Daunch, who said it was shocking to hear officers confirm Berry had been found.

'My heart was racing,' Daunch told CBS News. 'I mean, I was trembling. I was crying.'

The response from police on the scene was no different.

'My partner was driving. So she came up to the driver's side. He looked up at me and he's like, "It's her." Just emotion from that point that he confirmed it was Amanda was overwhelming,' Espada wrote in an official police report obtained by CBS.

He also recounted the moment that Michelle Knight, 32, jumped into his arms as he searched the house. Knight went missing in 2002 at age 21. Her case was never reported in the media and authorities believed that she had run away.

Seconds later, they found Gina DeJesus - who was abducted off a busy street in 2004 when she was 14.

An emotional Espada radioed into his supervisors: 'We found them. We found them.'

Daunch said it was chilling to hear Amanda Berry's voice on a 911 call

'To see this outcome and be following
it for all these years, it was - I'm so glad, and I got to see the end 
of it,' Daunch said. 'She's home. I got to be there from the beginning 
to the end.'

A brief video filmed by Jasmina 
Baldrich shows the very first image of Berry after she broke out of the 
house of horrors after being held captive for a decade.

Berry can be seen clutching her 
six-year-old daughter Jocelyn in her arms and holding Charles Ramsey’s 
hand for comfort. Ramsey was later hailed has a hero for responding to 
Berry’s cries for help and phoning 911.

Cops can be seen prying
open the front door of Castro's house. Once open, they flood into the 
home, some reaching for their handguns.

Baldrich and her friend Ashley Colon 
were driving down Seymour Avenue on Monday evening when they were 
suddenly surrounded by police cruisers.

Baldrich thought she was being pulled over. Within second, the officers 
started running toward a house and breaking down the door.

‘We just seen cops and then out of nowhere all we see Amanda walking by 
saying I'm Amanda Berry,’ Baldrich told NewsNet 5 in Cleveland.

Baldirch said she and Colon both immediately realized what was happening.

‘We both got goose bumps at the same time.  We were shocked, we could not believe it,’ Colon said.

The revelation that Berry, Gina 
DeJesus and Michelle Knight were alive and had been kept as sex slaves 
for a decade shocked and horrified the nation, but it was seen as a 
miracle in Cleveland.

Berry and DeJesus with both well 
known missing persons cases. Their disappearance haunted their 
neighborhood and their parents made public campaigns to search for them 
and plead for their return.

Berry was nearly 17 when she 
disappeared in 2003. DeJesus was just 14 when she was taken off a street
walking home in 2004. Knight disappeared in 2002, but because she was 
an adult and because her mother assumed she had run away, her case fell 
through the cracks.

‘I didn’t get to see Michelle because
- she came out so fast … but I was so focused on Gina because she was 
so, she was shaking, she was like, it was sad ... and they were all 
together that's the crazy thing, you know -- and we didn't even know 
what was going on, we just pulled over because we thought we were going 
to get stopped,’ Colon told NewsNet 5.

The three women have hired attorneys 
and a PR firm to represent them as the entire world waits for them to 
make their first public appearances.

Their lawyer addressed the media on 
Sunday morning with a brief public statement saying the girls were 
thankful for the support from the community.

However, they asked for privacy and said they would not give any public interviews until after Castro’s trial.

He is being held on $8million bail on three counts of rape and four counts of kidnapping. 
The prosecutor said he hopes to add murder charges to Castro’s 
indictment and pursue the death penalty after he allegedly beat his 
victims so that they had miscarriages.

A 10-foot chainlink fence now 
surrounds the house on Seymour and work crews boarded up the windows to 
protect the home, and any remaining evidence inside, from furious 
Clevelanders who have threatened to burn it to the ground.
