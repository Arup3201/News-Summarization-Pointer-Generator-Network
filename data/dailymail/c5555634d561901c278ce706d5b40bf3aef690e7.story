A defence lawyer has caused a mistrial in a Miami murder case by posting a photo of her client’s leopard print underwear on Facebook.

The incident happened after Fermin Recalde’s family had brought him a fresh set of clothes to wear during his trial, where he stands accused of stabbing his girlfriend to death.

While the clothes were being held up for routine inspection, Recalde’s lawyer snapped his underwear on her cell phone, according to witnesses.

Underwear error: Public defence lawyer Anya Cintron Stern, left, posted a photo of her client's leopard print underwear on her Facebook page; a judge then found out about the photo and threw the murder case out

During a break, Anya Cintron Stern promptly posted the picture to her personal Facebook page.

The 31-year-old allegedly wrote a mocking caption besides the photo suggesting that Recalde’s family believed the animal print underwear was 'proper attire for trial'.

Although Stern’s Facebook is only open to her friends, someone who saw the photo reported it to the judge, who declared a mistrial.

Stern was immediately fired from representing Recalde according to Miami-Dade Public Defender Carlos Martinez, whose office works for clients who cannot afford a private attorney.

Martinez told the Miami Herald that clients are entitled to lawyers’ loyalty and respect, adding that posting humiliating photos undermines the client-lawyer relationship.

The underwear incident occurred after Recalde had unsuccessfully tried to fire his lawyers several times, reported the Herald.

The judge must now assign a new lawyer and set a new trial date.

On
Easter Monday 2010, Recalde allegedly stabbed Dora Rial, his girlfriend
of two years, after he confronted her about a love bite on her cheek.

The 42-year-old mother died after suffering two stabs to the chest.

Recalde turned himself into police and was charged with second degree murder.
