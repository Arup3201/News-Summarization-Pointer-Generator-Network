Fed up of your neighbor's dog barking? 

It seems you could be in for a windfall.

A couple in Oregon have been awarded $240,000 compensation for more than a decade of disquiet.

Dale and Debra Krein of Rogue River filed a suit in 2012 against their neighbors and their giant Tibetan mastiffs.

Winners! Debra and Dale Krein (pictured) have been awarded $240,000 after complaining that their neighbors' Tibetan mastiffs have caused them more than a decade of disquiet by barking until 5am

Overruled: John Updegraff and Karen Szewc (above)  tried to argue they needed the dogs for their livestock

Finally, after three years of proceedings, a jury has ruled in favor of the disgruntled Oregonians, ordering for the canines to be debarked within 60 days.

Debarking is a surgical operation that reduces tissue in the vocal chords. 

The procedure lowers the volume of a dog's bark. 

The Kreins claimed their lives have been plagued by the noise since the defendants, John Updegraff and Karen Szewc, started breeding dogs in 2002.

According to the Mail Tribune, the canines would routinely bark until 5am and throughout the day outside the property just 300 feet from the Kreins.

The jury ruled that the Tibetan mastiffs (stock image), born in 2002, should have their vocal chords removed

Irritation: The Kreins' property (right) is less than 300 meters from Updegraff and Szewc (center), who claim to keep livestock on their sprawling land. The jury ruled their dogs were unsuited to protecting livestock

This continued, they told the court, despite the fact that Updegraff and Szewc were cited by Jackson County Animal Control in 2002 and 2004 for violating public nuisance codes.

The defendants attempted to argue that the mastiffs were needed to protect their livestock.

However, on Thursday a judge at Jackson County Circuit Court ruled the animals were not suited to the role.
