Apprentice presenter Lord Alan Sugar had a blazing row with Channel 5 owner Richard Desmond over his decision to quit television company YouView, ending with cries of: 'You're fired'.

The heated exchange between the two television heavyweights took place in a glass-walled YouView boardroom, located at Desmond's Northern & Shell Thameside skyscraper and was seen by around 100 employees.

Their argument ended with Lord Sugar advancing towards Desmond with fists clenched, and the Channel 5 owner shouting the Apprentice catchphrase, 'You're fired' at him, according to sources.

Both men are known for their straight-talking and taking no prisoners when it comes to business.

A source told The Guardian Desmond 'went mad and shouted' when Sugar revealed he was resigning. 'Desmond lost it, then Sugar definitely lost his temper and chased him 
around the floor.'

YouView confirmed yesterday that Lord Sugar is leaving his role, which saw him bring his commercial expertise to the project before overseeing the launch of the much delayed internet television service in 2012.

In a statement Lord Sugar said: 'When I joined YouView in 2011, my 
brief from the shareholders was to use my experience in the electronics 
industry to get the product to market and into the homes of consumers.

'Having done that successfully, my job is complete and I will now focus my time and attention into my other businesses.'

Referring to the argument, Lord Sugar's statement said: 'I told him I have finished with YouView and the row increased and he ran away from me because he was frightened and then to play-act he shouted "You're fired."'

A spokeswoman for Desmond declined to comment. Desmond's net worth is estimated at £1billion, Sugar's at £800m by the Sunday Times Rich List.

Other stakeholders in the YouView include BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Five and telecoms businesses BT and TalkTalk.
