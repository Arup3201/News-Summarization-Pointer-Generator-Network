Images have emerged showing Paul Walker smiling in the passenger seat of his friend's Porsche just moments before they smashed into a post and perished in a fiery crash.

The 40-year-old actor was photographed leaving a charity fundraiser in Santa Clarita, California on November 30 with the window of the bright red Porsche Carerra GT rolled down.

But just moments after leaving for the short ride with his friend and financial adviser, Roger Rodas, the vehicle crashed into a pole and tree before coming to a stop.

Less than a minute later, the vehicle burst into flames - killing the beloved actor.

Final moments: Actor Paul Walker is pictured for the last time on November 30 before this Porsche Carerra GT smashed into a pole and burst into flames, killing him and the driver - his friend Roger Rodas

The images are believed to be the 
final time Walker was pictured before his death. Rodas, who was driving,
 also died in the crash.

They emerged the day after Walker's remains were removed from the L.A. County Coroner's Office and taken to a local mortuary.

TMZ reported that his body is now in the hands of his family, who will decide when and where to lay him to rest.

Authorities
 say speed had been a factor in the crash and toxicology test results are still pending. They could take as long as six weeks.

An autopsy concluded that 
Walker was killed by injuries from both the impact and the subsequent 
fire, and dispatch recordings revealed that firefighters noted he was 'DOA' when they got there.

Rodas, 38, died from 
‘multiple traumatic injuries’ before the car exploded in flames, 
according to the autopsy released by the Los Angeles County coroner's 
office.

Heading off: He and Rodas left a fundraising event in Santa Clarita for a short drive before the crash. The Porsche is notoriously hard to handle

Having fun: The friends, who had bonded over their love of cars, smile as they chat in the Porsche

Short ride: The pair were only heading out for a short ride after leaving the event in Santa Clarita

Leaving: The supercar can be seen leaving the event, just moments before the two men were killed

The pair had bonded over a passion for fast cars.

They
 co-owned an auto racing team named after Rodas' custom car shop, Always
 Evolving, and Rodas drove professionally for the team on the 
Pirelli World Challenge circuit this year.

Ahead
 of the crash, Walker was in Santa Clarita for a fundraiser his charity,
 Reach Out Worldwide, organized for victims of the recent Philippines 
typhoon.

The event took place at Rodas' shop, and two stepped away for what was supposed to be a short drive in Rodas' car.

The limited-edition Porsche was previously owned by IndyCar driver Graham Rahal, who has said it could be difficult to drive.

Walker,
 the star of five of the six 'Fast & Furious' movies, was the face 
of the franchise and he was making the seventh film in the series when 
he died.

Not destroyed: Though the car exploded in flames, its three data recorders survived and may produce information to pinpoint the speed

Heartbreaking: Friends were unable to save Walker. The car is pictured still burning as firefighters arrive

Wreck: Witnesses walk away from the tragic scene. Walker was killed by his injuries and by the fire

Universal Pictures has shut down production while it contemplates how it might go forward without him.

On Sunday, fans gathered near to the crash site for a massive memorial, which had been planned through social media, for the actor.

Thousands came to pay their respects, placing flowers, candles and other tributes at the scene.

Many arrived in cars built for speed, and the sounds of engines revving echoed close to where Walker and his friend died in the crash.

The memorial also coincided with news that the actor had planned to give up his life as a Hollywood actor to spend more time with his 15-year-old daughter, Meadow.

Meadow had recently moved from her home in Hawaii to live with Walker in Santa Barbara.

In an interview earlier this year, Walker described his daughter as 'the best partner I've ever had'.

Memories: Loud cars were driven past a crowd attending the memorial on Sunday for Paul Walker

'I've never had anything like this in my life,' he said. 'I've been so transient; I've been on my own since I was 16. There's a part of me who feels like I'm making up for lost time.'

According to two of Walker's closest friends, Walker believed he had accomplished all that he wanted from Hollywood and now believed he needed to devote himself to his daughter.

'He was a family man and I know it hurt him to be spending so much time away from Meadow on location; he loved being with his daughter, she was his world,' Ronn Shikari told The Mail Online.

'That’s why he wanted to retire from acting and talked to his family about it, as he’d achieved everything he wanted to achieve.

‘He earned millions from the last Fast and Furious. The big reason he wanted to quit acting was so that he could spend more time with Meadow. It’s a shame that it could never happen.’
