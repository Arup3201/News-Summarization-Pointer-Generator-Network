Last week’s by-election results confirmed what many of us in the Labour Party have been thinking for months – that Ed Miliband needs to step down as leader and make way for an election winner.

It is not the performance of a Government-in-waiting to scrape a majority of little more than 600 votes in Heywood and Middleton, a previously safe Labour seat.

Ed is a decent, intelligent man. That is not in question.

Former Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay said Ed Miliband must resign if Labour is to win the next election 

But – and there is no gentle way of putting this – his leadership is a complete disaster.

Yes, if we manage to stay at our current rating of around 35 per cent, then Ed may well become Prime Minister in May.

However, recent history demonstrates that this cannot be relied upon.

In the 1980s, Labour leaders Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock were also ahead in the polls for much of their time, yet fell short.

Ed’s speech to the Labour Party conference last month, when he forgot to mention the deficit, was a train crash.

My fear is that his fluff will join Mr Foot’s donkey jacket – when he wore a green coat while placing a wreath on the cenotaph in 1981 – as symbolic of a doomed leadership.

Likewise, when Mr Kinnock fell over on Brighton beach, clutching his wife Glenys as he evaded a wave during the 1983 party conference, it became a metaphor for the electoral tsunami that was to come.

Despite their flaws, even Foot and Kinnock demonstrated qualities which Ed lacks.

Kinnock bravely tackled Militant Tendency and Foot was one the greatest orators of all time.

The reason they both lost to Margaret Thatcher was because voters could not imagine either man standing in front of No 10. Ed has the same problem.

The Miliband ‘brand’ has failed. I am a traditional, old-fashioned politician who left school at 16, worked for local council and began my political career in the unions.

There is no gentle way of putting this but Ed Miliband's leadership of the Labour Party has been a disaster 

Both Neil Kinnock, left and Michael Foot, right, both seemed destined to win a general election for Labour 

For 18 years as an MP, I represented the solid, working-class seat of Thurrock in Essex.

It is now held by the Tories on a wafer-thin majority from Labour, but could be vulnerable to Ukip.

Clacton, where Ukip triumphed last week, is only 40 miles down the road. Ed will never appeal to floating voters in such vital marginal seats.

He has surrounded himself with too many wet-behind-the-ears advisers and apparatchiks who have never done a real day’s work in their lives.

Chief courtier in this dysfunctional set is Douglas Alexander, who combines his role as Shadow Foreign Secretary with heading our General Election strategy team.

Douglas was heavily implicated in Gordon Brown’s ‘bottled’ Election U-turn of 2007, ran David Miliband’s failed leadership campaign and played a key role in the pro-union referendum campaign in Scotland, which was floundering until Brown stepped in to save the day.

And we are counting on him to deliver victory in 2015. How stupid.

Of our elder statesmen, no-nonsense former Home Secretary Alan Johnson or plain-talking ex-Chancellor Alistair Darling would both be better leaders than Ed Miliband.

And among younger Labour MPs, Yvette Cooper, Chuka Umunna and Andy Burnham can all, unlike Ed, deliver crisp, cogent – and complete – speeches.

Ed, for the sake of the party we both love, please stand aside now.
