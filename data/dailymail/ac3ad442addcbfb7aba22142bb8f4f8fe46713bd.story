Scots tycoon Mary Gorman has been told she must stand trial on drugs and violence charges that could see her jailed for up to ten years.

The multi-millionaire wife of Gadget Shop founder Chris Gorman was arrested last year after allegedly performing a sex act on an unknown man in a U.S. nightclub toilet cubicle while her husband watched.

Gorman, 43, is accused of assaulting a police office who was attempting to eject her from the Roxy nightclub in Orlando, Florida.

It is also claimed that she had two wraps of cocaine in her handbag, as well as drugs paraphernalia. She denies the charges.

Strike a deal: Mary Gorman, 43, (left) wife of Chris Gorman (right) was initially told she would avoid a prison sentence if she pleaded guilty

It emerged last month that the 
Gormans' lawyers had brokered a provisional deal that would have allowed
 the mother of four to avoid trial, and any admission of guilt, in 
return for carrying out 100 hours of community service.

But U.S. prosecutors have performed a U-turn and Gorman now faces trial.

The change of approach was apparently 
sparked by growing  concern within the state attorney's office that the 
community service option was too lenient, given the charge of violence 
against a police officer.

Gorman was charged with battery of a police officer and possession of cocaine at an Orlando club in August

The dramatic turnaround will be a 
devastating blow to Gorman and her 44-year-old husband, who have an 
estimated £45million fortune.

In a pre-Christmas statement, she 
said: 'Living under the shadow of this incident  has placed our family 
under considerable strain, so I am very encouraged that a resolution has
 been agreed.

'We fully agree with our lawyer and 
the state prosecutor's office that this is the most suitable way to deal
 with the matter and look forward to agreeing the details in the New 
Year.'

But a Florida court source said 
yesterday: 'The pre- diversion programme was intended for first-time 
offenders not facing violence charges.

'Mrs Gorman is charged with battery of
 a police officer and so was not deemed suitable to take part in the 
programme. The charges are too serious to be part of the programme.'

Gorman's lawyers are understood to be 
confused about the change of heart, given that prosecutors knew the 
severity of the charges before discussing the option of the pre-trial 
diversion scheme.

Last month, her Orlando-based lawyer 
Mark Horwitz began negotiating her planned acceptance onto the programme
 with prosecutors. The community service would have taken place in the 
U.S.

Yesterday, Mr Horwitz said: 'I'm 
disappointed that the pre-trial diversion programme which was previously
 agreed upon is no longer moving forward. We will now commence a 
vigorous defence of this case and are confident of a successful 
outcome.'

without charge

Gorman was arrested after allegedly being seen by an off-duty police officer carrying out the sex act in the club's toilet.

Her husband was also said to have been
 in the cubicle. The pair had been at a hip-hop night at the club while 
on a family holiday to Disney World.

Gorman faces three felony charges: 
battery of a police officer; possession of a Class A drug; and 
possession of drug paraphernalia.

Her husband was arrested for allegedly interfering with his wife's arrest but no charges were brought against him.

Under the original deal, as well as completing 100 hours of community service, she would have had to undergo random drug tests.

Gorman, who lives with her husband in a
 £2million home in Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, will have to go to 
Orlando to face the charges. She also faces the potential embarrassment 
of full details of the case being revealed in court.

A spokesman for the state attorney's 
office in Orlando said: 'Mrs Gorman's admittance into the pre-trial 
diversion programme was denied. A court date will be arranged for her to
 go on trial.'

The Gormans refused to comment.
