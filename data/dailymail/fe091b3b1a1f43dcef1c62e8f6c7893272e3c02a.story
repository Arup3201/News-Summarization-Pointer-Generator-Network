Chelsea are preparing a £20million summer move for Everton full back Seamus Coleman.

The Republic of Ireland defender has forged a reputation as one of the best right backs in the Premier League and Jose Mourinho is a confirmed admirer.

Everton are wary of interest in Coleman, signed for £60,000 from Sligo Rovers in 2009, and have been scouting for possible replacements.

They have enquired about Barcelona’s 23-year-old Martin Montoya and have also watched Rochdale’s Rhys Bennett, also 23.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez has hailed Seamus Coleman and Leighton Baines as 'the best pair of full backs in England'.

He said: 'In previous years, full-backs only had to defend – it was a bonus if they crossed the halfway line. But now they have to be able to defend one-on-one, and help offensively too.'
