A Russian businessman who erected a garden fence that looks just like the gate that surrounded the Buchenwald concentration camp has denied he is anti-Semitic.

Nestor Lavrov, 53, commissioned the fence because he liked the design after seeing the images online and claims he had not realised the historical context of the words 'Jedem Das Seine'.

Lavrov claims he did not realise that the image he had seen was actually of gates put up in 1937 around one of the Nazi's first concentration camps in Buchenwald, near the central German town of Weimar. 

He said: 'I didn't know what the words Jedem Das Seine meant, but I looked it up and found it meant "To each his own".

'I like the phrase because this is my garden and it's for me and that's why I used it.'

The phrase has been an idiomatic German expression for centuries and, among other examples, appears in the title of a composition by Johann Sebastian Bach.

It was not uncommon for the Nazis to put propaganda slogans over their concentration camps of which the most famous was Arbeit Macht Frei (work makes you free) that was put above the gates in concentration camps like Dachau and Sachsenhausen.

Local officials in Russia have declined to act despite being made aware of the fact that the fence has been put up in the Istrinsky District in western Russia's Moscow Oblast region.

A spokesman for authorities said: 'He put the sign up on his own property and because he insists it is not anti-Semitic, there is nothing that can be done.'

The businessman is not the first to use the expression and then claim they did not know its historical context.

Several modern advertising campaigns in the German language, including ads for Nokia, REWE grocery stores, Burger King, and Merkur Bank have been marred by controversy after using the phrase Jedem das Seine or Jedem den Seinen.

An ExxonMobil advert campaign in January 2009 also touted Tchibo coffee drinks at the company's Esso stores with the slogan 'Jedem den Seinen!'

The adverts were withdrawn after protest from the Central Council of Jews in Germany, although a company spokesman said its advertising contractor had been unaware of the proverb's association with Nazism.

In March 2009, a student group associated with the Christian Democratic Union used the slogan for an education campaign in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, but later withdrew it due to public outcry.
