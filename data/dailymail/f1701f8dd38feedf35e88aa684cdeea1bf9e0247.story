New parents to a sick baby staged their wedding in hospital so they could be together for the event as a family.

Amber Brunell, 23, and Joshua Fox, 24, from Bangor, Pennsylvania, tied the knot last Thursday in the intensive care unit at St. Christopher's Hospital where their son, Lucas, is being monitored.

The infant was born weighing a healthy 9lbs 11oz on February 21 but shortly after birth an ultrasound revealed he had an obstruction in his intestines which was causing discomfort and required surgery.

Although the operation went well, he then developed an air leak in his left lung.

A tube was placed his chest to remedy the situation but when his oxygen levels did not improve further intervention was needed.

Doctors used an artificial heart-lung machine to take over the work of the newborn's lungs.

Within a few days his condition improved and he is now on the road to recovery.
