Australia has been slammed for its lack of action on climate change by a new report that ranks it the worst performer out of all the industrialised countries.

The 2015 Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), which rates countries based on their performance in five categories including climate change policy, ranked Australia as 60th – the second last place – just above Saudi Arabia. 

Guy Ragen from the Australian Conservation Foundation, who provided the report's authors with comment on Australia's climate policy, told Daily Mail Australia the results show that 'the world is going forward and we are going backward'.

'Our low ranking is mix of a few things, firstly it's because our per-person emissions are very high compared to other countries,' Mr Ragen said.

'What also caused the drop is that in the last 12 months our government has repealed the carbon price which did actually work. It reduced around 17 million from our electricity sector.

'They've also moved to weaken the renewable energy target. At the moment the target is 41,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020 and they want to reduce it to 26,000, so essentially they want to cut it by 40 odd per cent.

Despite making up 0.33 per cent of the population, Australia emits 1.14 per cent of the world's carbon emissions.

The poor result has been attributed to the government's worsening climate policy, including a proposal to weaken the renewable energy target. Pictured: Yallourn Power Station in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria

This is a significant imbalance when compared to Denmark which was ranked first amongst the countries scrutinised by the report and was recorded as having 0.08 per cent of the world's population and emitting 0.11 per cent of the globe's CO2. 

Even the United States and China, which are the world's biggest producers of CO2 and produce 14.69 per cent and 23.43 of the world's emissions respectively, managed to score five ranks higher than Australia.

Mr Ragen said that if Australia wanted to improve its ranking, it would need to implement a much higher emission reduction target. 

'Ours is a five per cent reduction commitment by 2020. In the US they've announced a 28 per cent reduction by 2025. For us to match that we'd have to commit to 30 per cent,' he said.

Australia's ranking has worsened over time: 'As Tony Abbot withdrew a lot of good policies in place and the Australian delegation play a very negative role at the climate negotiations, the policy grades where much worse than in previous years,'  Jan Burck, the report's author said

The reports authors, Jan Burck from political and social analyst group Germanwatch, also pinned the worsening results on failed government policy.

Guy Ragen from the Australian Conservation Foundation said the results show that 'the world is going forward and we are going backward'

'As Australia has (compared to the most other countries) a very high emissions level, a bad emissions trend, nearly no new renewables [sic] and also no good developments in the field of energy efficiency, Australia's better rating in the past came from the policy part,' Ms Burck told Daily Mail Australia.

'Your former government was relatively pro active regarding climate change policies like emission trading schemes or carbon taxes. 

'As Tony Abbot withdrew a lot of good policies in place and the Australian delegation play a very negative role at the climate negotiations, the policy grades where much worse than in previous years.'

The report, which was created by Germanwatch and Climate Action Network Europe and released in  Peru where the United Nations climate talks are taking place, was issued as news emerged that Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop was originally blocked from attending the talks by the Prime Ministers office.

However Ms Bishop bypassed the decision through a Cabinet meeting and is now expected to arrive in Peru's capital on Tuesday to meet with almost 200 other leaders to discuss a global climate change agreement.
