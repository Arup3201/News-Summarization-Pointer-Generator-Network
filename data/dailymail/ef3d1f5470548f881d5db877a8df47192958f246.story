Honolulu detectives are following the spending spree on Robert Allenby's stolen credit card, as they try to solve the mystery surrounding his alleged abduction last week.

Investigators have also been door-knocking businesses throughout the city for video surveillance footage that might help them piece together what happened to the Australian golfer on the night he was bashed and robbed.

'Detectives are reviewing witness statements and gathering security video footage,' Michelle Yu of the Honolulu Police Department said.

'They are also looking into recent charges made on Mr Allenby’s credit card. No arrest has been made.'

Four days have passed since Robert Allenby's attack. As yet local police have made no arrests and are still seeking more surveillance video to help with their investigation. Authorities believe the spending spree on his stolen credit card is their best chance of an arrest

'It’s such a shame that people are focusing on whether the story is true,' Robert Allenby is believed to have said in text messages to the Golf Channel. 'I say you only have to look at me to see the truth.'

'Detectives have opened second degree robbery and fraudulent use of credit card investigations,' Ms Yu added.

'That means we investigate it as a felony rather than a misdemeanour.

''Second degree robbery is punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment; fraudulent use of credit cards is punishable by up to five years.'

But other CCTV is being sought from the strip around the wine bar where Allenby was last seen. 

'The (extra) video will be very helpful,' Honolulu Police Department Captain Rade Vanic said.

Staff at the wine bar in which Allenby, 43, was last seen at about 11pm on Friday said 'we can't say anything about that', when contacted by Daily Mail Australia and asked if they had seen anything untoward on the night.

With varying stories from Allenby and Charade Keane, the woman who helped the dazed and bruised Australian in the early hours on Saturday morning, detectives are trying to reconstruct the incident.

They are believed to be already in possession of vision which shows Allenby leaving the Amuse Wine Bar at about 11pm on the Friday, with two, as yet unidentified men, and a woman. And more CCTV footage of two men buying alcohol, apparently with the golfer's credit card, has been taken from a store at Waikiki.

Allenby said he couldn't remember much in the hours after being assaulted and robbed.

Capt Vanic said not only were detectives attempting to find more surveillance footage of what Allenby described as a Hollywood-style attack and kidnapping, but they were now seeking video from stores where the culprits might have used his stolen credit cards.

Police said they could publicly release video of suspects in the hope of identifying the thieves.

'We do have video from various retail establishments, so we are looking into it,' Capt Vanic said.

'Of course, if it does show individuals who are possible suspects, we will do our best to identify them and may even put it out with our Crime Stoppers information.

'But it is still very early on in our investigation.'

Capt Vanic said Keane gave police a statement and they would interview her again if needed.

Robert Allenby missed the cut at the Sony Golf Open in Honolulu

Allenby was drinking with friends at the upmarket Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki on Friday night and believed he was drugged, bashed in the face with a fist or baseball bat, tossed in the boot of a car, robbed and then dumped in a park 10 kilometres away.

The drama began when Allenby was separated from his friends in the bar, caddie Mick Middlemo and Anthony Puntoriero. 

'I didn't think I was going to survive this one,' Allenby said.

'I was separated from my friend in the bar after we had paid the tab at 10:48pm and he went to the bathroom and next thing you know I'm being dumped in a park miles away.

'I only know this part because a homeless woman found me and told me she saw a few guys pull up and throw me out of the car.

'That is where I got the scrapes above my eye, from the side-walk.'

The homeless woman he referred to is believed to be Ms Keane, who said she found and helped Allenby a short distance away from the bar, perhaps 50 metres down the road, at about 1.30am - some two and a half hours after he disappeared.

The confusion over what happened to Robert Allenby includes his belief that he was found two and a half hours after he left his friends and some 10 kilometres away from where he was dining and Charade Keane's claim that it was just 50 metres from the Amuse Wine Bar

Bizarrely Allenby had an emotional reunion with the homeless woman, just hours after he accused her of being paid to spread false stories about what happened that night.

The golfer embraced and kissed Ms Keane, as they greeted each other back at the spot where she said they first met, across the road from the Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki on Saturday morning.

'I really appreciate what you did,' Allenby told her.

The reunion came a few hours after the multi-millionaire pro-golfer reportedly speculated in text messages to Golf Central that Keane was was 'getting paid' to relay details of the incident to the media.

Capt Vanic said robberies similar to the way Allenby described were not common in Honolulu, a popular destination for tourists from Australia and around the world.

'Honolulu is a big city and there are tourists who, unfortunately, are victims of a crime, but it is not something that happens very frequently in Honolulu,' Capt Vanic added.

Allenby was in Hawaii to compete in the PGA Tour's Sony Open, but missed the halfway cut on Friday.

Allenby, whose face was badly cut and bruised, announced on Tuesday he would not play in this week's PGA Humana Challenge event in La Quinta, California, on the advice of his doctor. 'This will enable me to ensure I am fully recovered prior to rejoining the PGA Tour,' he added
