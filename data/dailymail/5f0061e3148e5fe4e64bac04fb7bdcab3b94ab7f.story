They may have been attempting to make peace but the tensions in the air were all too clear as the presidents of Russia and Ukraine met for crisis talks.

Against a backdrop of escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine, one telltale image shows Vladimir Putin giving a smug smile while Petro Poroshenko glares across the table at the Russian leader during the meeting in the Belarusian capital Minsk today.

The line-up for the world's most awkward tea party was completed by the leaders of France and Germany, Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel, who joined Putin and Poroshenko for drinks, biscuits and nibbles.

In the same image President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel looked decidedly ill at ease themselves, perched uneasily next to each other on a sofa.

Putin and Poroshenko had earlier shaken hands anything but warmly after the Ukrainian leader warned on arrival that without a de-escalation of the conflict and a ceasefire, the situation in the east of the country would get 'out of control'.

The four leaders met alone at around 5.15pm before heading for a full summit with their delegations later, as part of a Franco-German lead attempt to end the fighting.

A Belarusian representative said the four leaders meeting alone was an unexpected break with diplomatic procedure and it was not clear whether they would meet with their delegations as planned. 

The four were joined by their foreign ministers before moving into the official negotiating room.

Hopes for a breakthrough appear slim and would depend on Ukraine making most of the concessions, with advancing rebels unlikely to agree to halt and go back to previous positions.

Still, Moscow expressed optimism. A Russian diplomatic source said it was 70 per cent likely that an agreement would be reached.

'The presidents aren't travelling [to Minsk] for no reason,' the source said.

But even as he spoke pro-Moscow separatists tightened the pressure on Kiev by launching some of the war's worst fighting.

The Kiev army said 19 of its soldiers were killed in a day of pro-Russian separatist assaults near the railway town of Debaltseve, some of the worst losses it has reported in nine months of war.

Rebels who tore up a five-month-old truce in January are trying to encircle government forces in Debaltseve, a strategic location that would let them link up their main strongholds.

Fighting has already killed more than 5,000 people, and Washington is now openly talking of arming Ukraine to defend itself from 'Russian aggression', raising the prospect of a proxy war in the heart of Europe between Cold War foes.

A surge in fighting in the 24 hours before the summit, including a rocket attack that killed 17 people deep in government-held territory on Tuesday, could be intended to force Ukraine to accept a deal recognising the rebel advance. 

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there had been progress in the run-up to the Minsk summit but Kiev could be holding back a deal by insisting on control of the Russian-Ukrainian border, part of which is held by the separatists.

The talks are taking place while an International Monetary Fund mission is trying to negotiate a bailout to save Ukraine from bankruptcy brought on by corruption and mismanagement as well as war.

Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said he hoped for a loan deal within days. 

Kiev and NATO accuse Russia of supplying separatists with men and weapons. Moscow denies it is involved in fighting for territory Putin calls 'New Russia'.

If the French and German leaders were hoping their peace initiative would be met by conciliatory moves on the ground, the prospect of talks appears to have triggered the opposite, with the pro-Russian rebels determined to drive home their advantage.

Armoured columns of Russian-speaking soldiers with no insignia have been advancing for days around Debaltseve. 

Last week they captured the small town of Vuhlehirsk next to Debaltseve, and a reconnaissance unit was there on Tuesday salvaging equipment from abandoned Ukrainian trenches.

The squad's commander said his men did not want a truce while they had government forces on the run.

On the Russian side of the border, Moscow announced war games on Tuesday on the eve of the talks.

The United States has been openly discussing arming the Ukrainian government, a move that is opposed by European allies who say it would escalate the conflict while falling far short of giving Kiev the firepower needed to win.

President Barack Obama says he has yet to make up his mind on the question of sending weapons. 

He spoke by phone overnight to Putin, and the White House said he warned the Russian leader that the costs would rise if Moscow kept aiding the separatists.

A decision by the West to provide arms to Ukraine could prompt a rapid escalation of Russian support for the separatists, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a global security think tank, said on Wednesday.

Kiev military spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov, briefing journalists on rebel attempts to encircle government forces holding Debaltseve, said the 19 soldiers had been killed 'in shelling, rocket attacks and military clashes'.

In separatist-held territory, rebel authorities said six people were killed and eight seriously hurt when a shell hit a bus station in the city of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine.

Reuters journalists saw the body of a man behind the wheel of a minibus after the shell fell through the roof of the station, burning up the vehicle and another beside it.
