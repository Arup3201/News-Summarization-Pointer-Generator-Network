Surely the last thing any comedian worth his salt wants to see is his audience yawning.

But one YouTube prankster has travelled the world for his latest stunt - with the sole aim of making people yawn.

And despite its sleepy content, the video of his adventures - ultimately aimed at making its viewers yawn too - has gone viral with more than two million hits on YouTube so far.

Contagious: Prankster Roman Atwood is seen raucously yawning at a variety of global tourist destinations, including the Eiffel Tower, pictured here

Catching on: Fellow tourists are seen to yawn too once Atwood has walked past

Sleepy: The sole aim of Atwood's prank is to make viewers of the video yawn

Roman Atwood mingled with tourists at attractions across the globe and loudly yawned in the hope that it would catch on in what he describes as 'the world's most contagious prank'.

The funnyman, whose other pranks include irking locals by pretending to urinate up against the ancient pyramids in Egypt, is seen raucously yawning at home on his sofa at the beginning of the video.

He is then seen at a variety of the world's top tourist destinations, including the Eiffel Tower in Paris, New York's Statue of Liberty, Stonehenge in Wiltshire, the Colosseum in Rome and Mount Rushmore in South Dakota trying to get unwitting members of the public to take part in his prank.

And it seems that yawning really is contagious as tourists in every destination Roman is pictured at join in and mimic his fake sleepiness.

Unwitting: Roman walks past these two women who are deep in conversation and yawns and stretches loudly

Tired: Despite not paying much attention to Roman, one of the women still falls for the 'prank' and yawns in turn

Go away: Atwood is ushered away by this man who talks on his phone while the prankster yawns in his direction

Instinctive act: But despite his best efforts to ignore Roman, the man still ends up letting out a giant yawn himself

But not everyone saw the funny side of the prank.

In one clip, Roman is approached by two men who accuse Roman of 'spreading germs' with his incessant yawning.

One of the men tells Roman he needs to 'go home and get some rest.'

Even a dog gets in on the act, following his masters yawn at the end of the clip.

Not amused: But not everyone sees the funny side of the prank as these two men confront Atwood and tell him to move his incessant yawning along

Contrary to common belief, yawning is not actually a precursor to sleep.

It is actually said to cool the brain down and help us to stay awake and even more alert than we were.

While the video only shows those around Roman falling for his 'prank', it is unclear how many times his over pronounced yawning failed to catch on - only around half of adult humans are said to be prone to contagious yawning.

Two targets: Atwood attempts to get the man in the wheelchair and the woman pushing him to yawn

Gotcha: But it's the woman who falls for the prank and politely covers her face as she lets out a giant yawn

Man's best friend: The end of the video shows a man yawning while sat next to his pet

Dog tired: The hound soon follows suit and lets out its own yawn

VIDEO: The world's most contagious prank

Contrary to common misconceptions, yawning is actually designed to keep us awake rather than a precursor to sleep.

Almost all animals on the planet yawn and we are even known to yawn in the womb before we are born.

It is thought to cool the brain down so that it operates more effectively and makes us more alert.

But there are several theories as to why yawning seems to be contagious.

One theory is that we yawn when we see someone else doing it as we are taking part in anÂ  ancient ritual that evolved in early man to help groups stay alert and able to detect danger.

According to researchers at the University of Albany in New York, it is not catching another persons sleepiness but actually an 'empathic mechanism' designed to maintain group alertness.

Another theory suggests that it could be the result of some unconscious 'herding' behaviour - a subtle way of communicating with one another and letting on that we're tired.

Even snakes and birds yawn and dogs are said to yawn to remain calm in certain situations.
