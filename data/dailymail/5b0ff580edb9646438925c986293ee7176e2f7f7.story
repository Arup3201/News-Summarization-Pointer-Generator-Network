Marine Corps officials announced Thursday that three women have become the first to ever graduate from its tough-as-nails infantry course - but it could be two years before they’re allowed to serve in an infantry unit.

The three completed the 59-day course at North Carolina’s Camp Geiger and met the same grueling test standards as the men, but even as more jobs are opened to women across all military branches Marines Corps leaders say they need more time to study whether females are fit to serve as grunts.

Now Pvt. 1st Class Julia Carroll, Pvt. 1st Class Cristina Fuentes Monternegro, and Pvt. 1st Class Katie Gorz will go on to serve vital roles, but their historic accomplishment will remain largely symbolic.

Victors: Private First Class Katie Gorz, 19, of St. Paul, Minnesota also completed the grueling course, the Marine Corps said Thursday

This despite having successfully endured a 12-mile march with an 80-pound pack and a variety of combat fitness tests such as timed combat shuttle runs, timed ammunition container lifts and tests that simulate running under combat fire.

‘Any force-wide changes to be made will occur only after we have conducted our research, determined the way ahead and set the conditions to implement our recommendations,’ Marine spokeswoman Captain Maureen Krebs told the Washington Post.

The step comes as the Marine Corps continues to evaluate where women might serve in combat. Earlier this year, the Pentagon lifted the ban on women serving in combat jobs, but each of the service branches is developing how this might be accomplished.

The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps are looking at the standards required for serving in battlefront jobs such as infantry, armor and elite commando positions. They have until Jan. 1, 2016, to open as many jobs as possible to women, and to explain why if they decide to keep some closed.

The common requirements for men and women for each job would be based on specific tasks. Military officials have said the standards will not be lowered in order to bring women into any combat posts.

Fuentes Montenegro, 25, of Coral Springs, Florida admitted she found the process difficult.

‘Our instructor, he told us all it takes is everything you got, and it’s true,’ she told the Military Times. ‘Once you are committed to a goal, you can make it if you put everything into it.’

Symbolic only: Despite their historic accomplishment, the women will not be joining an infantry unit because the Marine Corps has yet to okay that job for females

18-year-old Julia Carroll of Idaho Falls, Idaho doesn’t think what she’s done is much to write home about.

‘I don’t really feel anything special just because, [the male graduates] did the same thing that we did, and a lot of them did it better than us,’ she said. ‘I don’t feel any different from them, I don’t think.’

Katie Gorz, 19, of St. Paul, Minnesota declined an interview with the Military Times. Another woman, Harlee ‘Rambo’ Bradford will likely become the fourth female graduate once she recovers from a leg injury and if she can pass the final Combat Fitness Test and Physical Fitness Test.

On its website, the Marine Corps said the Camp Geiger course is the follow-on training for Marines who graduate from basic training at Parris Island, S.C., and about 20,000 Marines train there every year. Marines who complete recruit training at the post near San Diego move on to the infantry school at Camp Pendleton in California.

Rare honor: Fuentes Montenegro smiles at a male recruit. She was one of 15 women who showed up on day one. Only three completed Camp Geiger's grueling 59-day course

Uphill battle: Earlier this year, the Pentagon lifted the ban on women serving in combat jobs but even as the three women made history the Marine Corps said the ban remains on women in infantry units

Parris Island is the only site where female Marines go through basic training.

Carey said 15 women began the enlisted course with 254 men in September. It wasn't immediately clear exactly how many male Marines completed the course to graduation on Thursday.

She said the course is separate from one that trains Marine infantry officers for leadership positions at Quantico, Virginia. Several women lieutenants have attempted to complete that course, but so far none has passed.

A new group of enlisted Marines enters the infantry course every two weeks, and each of the units currently in training has women in them, Carey said.

Under a 1994 Pentagon policy, women 
were prohibited from being assigned to ground combat units below the 
brigade level. A brigade is roughly 3,500 troops split into several 
battalions of about 800 soldiers each. Historically, brigades were based
 farther from the front lines, and they often included top command and 
support staff.

Last 
year the military opened up about 14,500 combat positions to women, most
 of them in the Army, by allowing them to serve in many jobs at the 
battalion level. The January order lifted the last barrier to women 
serving in combat, but allows the services to argue to keep some jobs 
closed.

The bulk of the
 nearly 240,000 jobs currently closed to women are in the Army, 
including those in infantry, armor, combat engineer and artillery units 
that are often close to the battlefront. Similar jobs in the Marine 
Corps are also closed.

Privates Julia Carroll, 18; Cristina Fuentes Montenegro, 25; and Katie Gorz, 19 are the only women to ever successfully complete boot camp at North Carolina's Camp Geiger

@highlight

Despite their historic accomplishment, they will not actually be allowed to serve in an infantry unit for as long as two years as Marine Corps officials study the implications of female 'grunts'

@highlight

There were 15 female recruits when the women began, but only the three have completed the 59-day course

A fourth woman, Harlee 'Rambo' Bradford will likely become the fourth ever female to complete the course once she recovers from an injured leg and if she can pass the final Combat Fitness Test and Physical Fitness Test
