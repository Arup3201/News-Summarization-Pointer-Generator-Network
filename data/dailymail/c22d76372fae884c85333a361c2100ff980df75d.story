As the cold weather continued across much of the Northeast today there was at least one individual enjoying the almost freezing temperatures - the First Dog.

The White House released a photograph of Bo, the Portuguese Water Dog, enjoying the snow in Washington D.C.

The picture of the White House pet playing with a red bone toy was released on Twitter via the President's Twitter handle @BarackObama.

Fun: Bo, the First Dog, was photographed enjoying the snow while it lasted in Washington D.C. today

'Photo of the Day: Bo in the Snow', it read.

The icy weather is due to continue into early tomorrow as winter storm Luna is expected to bring freezing rain.

The Weather Channel warned it could 'make for a messy late morning commute for most of western and central Pennsylvania as well as parts of eastern Ohio and southern upstate New York'.

Forecasters at Accuweather.com said it was the same storm system that created dangerous ice shoves across the Midwest in recent days.

However it is expected it will quickly pass with the region heating up later in the morning with downpours turning to rain.

Big freeze: High, freezing cold winds pushed chunks of ice onto the shore of Lake Winnebago in Wisconsin, creating 25-foot high ice shoves

Frozen over: The huge piles of ice gave the region the appearance of an ice age

Snowfall is still expected in Northern New York and Southern New England - with Boston in line to get around an inch - but milder weather is on its way.

Many areas will hit average for this time of year in the first time for days.

The Midwest will experience particularly mild weather according to the Weather Channel with above average temperatures remaining beyond Tuesday

It will be a welcome relief to many who have been battling the snow trying to clear drives and to keep warm in below freezing conditions.

In Brooklyn, New York, around 200 homes devastated by Hurricane Sandy in October remained without heat.

Rescue mission: New Jersey mayor Cory Booker saved a dog seen shivering in the cold in Queens on Friday

'It's just getting colder and colder,' said Doreen Greenwood-Garson, chief of the Gerritsen Beach Fire Department.

On the East Coast, the freezing temperatures also hampered firefighters. At a blaze in Lawrence, Massachusetts on Thursday night, fireman battled grimly on as the spray-back from hoses hung in icicles from their uniforms and helmets.

And Bo wasn't the only political dog to be attracting attention in the cold weather. 

Mayor of New Jersey Cory Booker was commended for saving a freezing pet from the cold weather on Friday.

A reporting crew from ABC noticed the shivering dog outside a house in Queens and contacted the mayor, who headed down there in his car. 

Turning milder: Freezing rain may meet commuters in the Northeast today but generally the big freeze over the region and the Midwest will make way for milder temperatures

'This is brutal weather. This dog is shaking really bad and you just can’t leave your dogs out here on a day like this and go away and expect them to be OK,' he said. 

He later returned the dog, called Cha, Cha, whose owners said had snuck outside without them knowing.   

Elsewhere in the country rain showers are expected in the eastern half of Texas, Western Louisiana and Eastern Oklahoma with some gusty winds across the southern plains.

The Northwest and Four Corners States are expected to be unsettled tomorrow with heavy rain in the mountains of Central Arizona and heavy snow in the Colorado Rockies.
