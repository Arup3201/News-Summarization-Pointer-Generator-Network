It was third time lucky for SpaceX who today launched an observatory  toward a solar-storm lookout point a million miles away.

The unmanned Falcon 9 rocket blasted off at 6:03pm EST from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in perfect weather conditions.

High seas, however, prompted SpaceX to cancel a test that would have landed the rocket's discarded first stage on a platform in the ocean.

The California-based company said its autonomous spaceport drones were instead heading back to port in Jacksonville, Florida to pick up the remains.

'Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target & nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather,' tweeted Elon Musk. 

'We are experiencing just such weather in the Atlantic with waves reaching up to three stories in height crashing over the decks,' SpaceX said in a statement.   

'Also, only three of the drone ship's four engines are functioning, making station-keeping in the face of such wave action extremely difficult. 

'The rocket will still attempt a soft landing in the water through the storm (producing valuable landing data), but survival is highly unlikely.'

This time, the wind stayed within safety limits and everything else went SpaceX's way - at least for launch 

The unmanned Falcon 9 rocket blasted off on the third try in four days, hoisting the spacecraft for Nasa

Sending the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Satellite observatory on its $340 million mission was the main event of this launch.

DSCOVR (pronounced discover) is designed to provide advance warnings of solar outbursts that could disrupt life here on Earth.

DSCOVR will spend nearly four months traveling one million miles, four times farther than the moon, to the so-called Lagrange point, a gravity-neutral position in direct line with the sun. 

At this lookout location, 92 million miles from the sun, it will provide advance warnings of incoming geomagnetic storms that could disrupt power and communications on Earth, beginning around midsummer.

The steady stream of Earth pictures, meanwhile, is expected to be high on the 'wow' factor. 

The observatory's camera will provide the first snapshots of the entire home planet, its full face lit by the sun, since Nasa's final Apollo moon-landing in 1972. Subsequent Earth views have been stitched together from multiple images.

Sending the DSCOVR observatory on its $340 million mission was the main event. It represented the first deep-space mission for SpaceX.  

DSCOVR replaces a 17-year-old satellite monitoring for potentially dangerous solar storms, which can disrupt GPS signals, block radio communications and impact power grids on Earth.

It will take DSCOVR 110 days to reach its operational orbit around the sun. where it will serve as a weather buoy, providing about an hour's advance notice of threatening solar activity.

DSCOVR also has two sensors to monitor Earth to track volcanic plumes, measure ozone and monitor droughts, flooding and fires.

Former Vice President Al Gore - who dreamed up the idea for an environmentally conscious, Earth-gazing satellite 17 years ago - returned for the sunset launch. 

He was at the previous two attempts as well, eager to see his brainchild finally soar. 

SpaceX said there will be many other opportunities this year for test. 

Dangerously high winds kept the deep-space observatory grounded yesterday and put off a radically new landing test of the booster rocket.

SpaceX called off its sunset launch with just 12 minutes remaining in the countdown because of gusts of 115 mph several miles up - strong enough to damage the rocket in flight. 

Last-minute radar trouble foiled Sunday's launch effort, then SpaceX skipped Monday because of heavy rain.

And last month's inaugural test ended in flames after the launch of a supply run to the International Space Station.  

With three hours remaining in the countdown, SpaceX called off the radical landing test of the first-stage booster. It would have been just the second such experiment; last month's try ended in flames when the booster slammed into the platform, fell over and exploded. Pictured is the launch in Florida

The first-stage booster ran out of hydraulic fluid too soon and slammed into the platform, falling over and exploding.

SpaceX added extra hydraulic fluid for the guidance fins this time. 

But Musk and others warned the landing would be harder to nail because of the booster's higher incoming speed from 80 miles up.

Musk - whose Southern California company delivers supplies to the International Space Station and aims to haul astronauts as well in two years - wants to start retrieving and reusing his rockets to save time and money.

First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink.

Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack.

The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding.

Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'.

Saturday's mission was the group's first to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea, which was held in position using deep-sea oil rigs. Pictured is an image of the fuel and oxygen combining in an explosion
