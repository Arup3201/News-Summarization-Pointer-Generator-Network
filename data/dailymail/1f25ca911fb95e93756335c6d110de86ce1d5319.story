U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited China's sole aircraft carrier on Monday in an unprecedented opening by normally-secretive Beijing to a potent symbol of its military buildup.

A U.S. official said the visit to the carrier the Liaoning, at a port in the northern city of Qingdao, lasted about two hours. No other details were immediately available.

The official believed Hagel was the first official visitor from overseas to be allowed on board the Liaoning in a sign that China is responding to U.S. criticism over it's lack of transparency regarding its growing weapons programme.

The secretive visit comes days after the United States promised to send two missile defence ships to Japan to counter the growing threat from both North Korea and China.

Growing power: The 60,000-tonne Liaoning, a Soviet-era vessel bought from Ukraine in 1998 and re-fitted in a Chinese shipyard, is seen as a symbol of China's growing naval power and ambition for greater global influence

Hagel's carrier visit, at the start of his three-day trip to China, was quietly approved by Beijing at Washington's request, the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The carrier has yet to become fully operational, however, and military experts say it could be decades before China catches up to the far superior and larger U.S. carriers - if ever.

Early this year the Liaoning completed 
sea trials in the South China Sea. The official Xinhua News Agency said 
the carrier tested its combat system, conducted a formation practice and 'attained the anticipated objectives.'

Reporters travelling with Hagel did not accompany him on the vessel, in what is a rare visit to a sensitive Chinese military site.

'It's a sign of openness, of sincerity, that China has nothing to hide and wants to improve military relations with the United States,' said Ni Lexiong, a naval expert at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law.

'It will also be a good opportunity for the Americans to see the difference between the Liaoning and their aircraft carriers,' Ni said, referring to the technological gulf between the two countries.

Chinese military brass are no strangers to U.S. warships, including aircraft carriers.

Officers from the People's Liberation Army are routinely flown to U.S. aircraft carriers en route to occasional port stops in Hong Kong, according to U.S. military officials.

Their U.S. counterparts provide tours of the ship and flight deck during operations - efforts U.S. diplomats say are geared to nudging China towards greater transparency about its capabilities.

Ian Storey, a Singapore-based regional security expert, said earlier that Hagel's visit would be 'long on symbolism but short on actual operational capabilities'.

'By showing him a vessel that was built in Ukraine in the 1980s and remains only a training platform that is still not fully operational, the Chinese will be keeping him away from their more sensitive capabilities, such as their missile programmes or submarine fleets,' said Storey, of Singapore's Institute of South East Asian Studies.

Waging diplomacy: Hagel is on a 10-day trip to the Asia Pacific region and was leaving Japan today to travel to China. He is scheduled to meet with senior Chinese leaders before traveling to Mongolia, then returning home

China is building submarines, surface ships and anti-ship ballistic missiles, and has tested emerging technology aimed at destroying missiles in mid-air.

The carrier visit came a day after 
Hagel said he would use his first trip to China as defense secretary to 
press Beijing to use its 'great power' wisely and respect its 
neighbours, who have been put on edge by the country's growing 
assertiveness in Asia's disputed waters.

China
 claims 90 per cent of the 1.35 million sq mile South
 China Sea, which is believed to be rich in oil and gas. The 
Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim parts of 
those waters.

China has a 
separate dispute with Japan in the East China Sea over uninhabited 
islets that are administered by Japan. China's decision in November to 
declare an air defence identification zone in the area that includes 
those islands sparked protests from the United States, Japan and South 
Korea.

The Liaoning would serve as a training platform rather than a fighting weapon, some Chinese experts have said.

Considerable
 doubt also remains over when it will be fully operational. Earlier 
estimates of two or three years had grown rubbery, with some hints 
internally that it could stretch to a decade, some experts say.

Early
 this year the Liaoning completed sea trials in the South China Sea. The
 official Xinhua News Agency said the carrier tested its combat system, 
conducted a formation practice and "attained the anticipated 
objectives."
