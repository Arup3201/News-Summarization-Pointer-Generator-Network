Rush job: JK Rowling has admitted to rushing some of the Harry Potter books to meet tight publishing deadlines

The Harry Potter novels won her millions of readers, not to mention untold riches.

But JK Rowling says she is still not happy with them – and may yet rewrite some sections.

She told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme: ‘You think, “God I wish I’d had another year to rework it”.

There were a couple of the Potters where I definitely knew they needed another year, where I had to write on the run.

‘I read them and I think “Oh God”. Maybe I’ll go back and do a “director’s cut”, I don’t know.’

Miss Rowling, 47, was speaking ahead of the publication of her first adult novel, The Casual Vacancy.

She said this book was inspired by her own mental health problems.

She has previously spoken about how she considered suicide in the 1990s while living in Edinburgh and suffering from depression.

In an interview with US TV network ABC, Miss Rowling said she had ‘compulsions’ as a teenager.

She said: ‘We have an adult character in the book who has obsessive compulsive disorder. These are things I know from the inside. When I was in my teens I had issues with OCD.

‘Compulsions, like checking things, it was very common. Double checking, triple checking. It’s an anxiety disorder.’

The mother of three, who has built up an estimated £560million fortune through the Potter books, said she has not felt depressed for ‘more than a decade’ since she started writing them.

She said: ‘It cheered me up a lot. Harry gave me a job to do that I loved more than anything else.’

Miss Rowling told the BBC it was ‘very likely’ her next book will be for children.

She has previously admitted that the 
pressure of following up the seven Harry Potter novels led her to 
consider publishing The Casual Vacancy under a pseudonym, although she 
later decided that it would be ‘braver’ to be honest.

Miss Rowling told the BBC that her 
life as a single mother in the early Nineties informed much of the class
 issues in her latest opus, which she feels reflects the situation today
 in austerity-stricken Britain.

'I would say there's a whiff of the 
early-Nineties about the way these issues are being discussed right now.
 It's painfully familiar to me,' she said. 'In hard times the desire to 
stigmatise and to blame seems to become ever stronger.'

Days before its official launch, 
excerpts from her first book in the post-Harry Potter era began to 
emerge online – and it is clear that it is for grown-up eyes only.

Adult themes: Miss Rowling's latest book The Casual Vacancy hits bookseller's shelves tomorrow

While
 the full text of The Casual Vacancy is a closely guarded secret, an 
American journalist who has read it in the offices of publishers Little,
 Brown has revealed some of the book’s more risque passages.

Far from her usual wizard descriptions
 of fantastical battles between good and evil, Miss Rowling’s new tale 
is said to be one of class warfare, prostitution, heroin addiction and 
teen sexuality.

A female character is introduced with the description that the ‘leathery skin of her upper cleavage radiated little cracks that no longer vanished when decompressed’.

At another point in the book, the reader meets a ‘lustful boy’ who sits on a school bus ‘with an ache in his heart and in his b****’.

And the author’s usual fans may  also be shocked – if not a little perplexed – by the mention of one girl’s  ‘miraculously unguarded v*****’.

The 47-year-old, who has three children, previously revealed that she was ready for a change in genre after years of writing magical tales.

‘I had a lot of real-world material in me, believe you me,’ she told the New Yorker magazine.

‘The thing about fantasy – there are certain things you just don’t do.  You don’t have sex near unicorns. It’s an ironclad rule. It’s tacky.’

However, she insisted her decision to write for adults was ‘not that I just wanted to write about... sex’.

‘I think there is a through-line,’ she added. ‘Mortality, morality, [they are] the two things I obsess about.’

The Casual Vacancy will appear on the shelves at booksellers tomorrow. The full interview with Miss Rowling will also be broadcast tomorrow on Radio 4's Front Row at 7.15pm.
