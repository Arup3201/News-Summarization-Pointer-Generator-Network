Finally behind bars: Jennice Lynch (outside Burnley Crown Court) burgled the luxury home of her mother and father three times in a month

A 20-year-old unruly daughter who was repeatedly let off by judges despite waging a ‘campaign of spite’ against her parents has finally been locked up for two years.

Jennice Lynch, of Haslingden, Lancashire, burgled the home of her mother and father three times in a month - in one raid stealing a gold and diamond bracelet plus a £4,000 Jaguar watch.

She was let off by a judge - but just four weeks after her mother Ruth criticised the suspended custody term and warned she would back in trouble, Lynch went on a shoplifting spree.

The single mother of two was caught stealing wine, beer and spirits, but said she did it because she wanted to go to prison, adding: ‘I fancy a roof over my head and three square meals a day.’

A court heard she also then did not not turn up for probation appointments and instead helped herself to a charity box from a takeaway.

Today she was finally behind bars after a judge said yesterday that she had ‘thrown back’ numerous opportunities that were given to her.

She had earlier turned up several hours late for her hearing at Burnley Crown Court scruffily dressed, clutching a Lidl shopping bag and a lighted cigarette with ink on the back of her hand.

Her father John, 46, a company director, attended the court hearing with another of his daughters during the morning - but they left thinking Lynch  would not turn up.

The court heard Mr and Mrs Lynch, 45, had been deliberately targeted by her - even though they had tried to help her financially, bought her a flat and looked after her two young children.

She would invade her parents’ £300,000 rural home in Whitworth, Lancashire, when they were out. In one break-in, her own children’s toys were showered with glass and had to be thrown away.

Mr and Mrs Lynch, whose three other daughters are an accountant, a company manager and a university student, later told police they were disgusted with their daughter’s behaviour. They called for her to be locked up and said they had never had any problems with any of their other children.

But last March she was given a 22-month prison term suspended for two years after she admitted three burglaries. She promised there had been a ‘seachange’ in her behaviour.

But at the time housewife Mrs Lynch, whose husband runs an energy company, said: ‘The suspended sentence was a joke and she will see this as a reason to do it all again.

‘It will either be us or someone else she knows. Most people would be ashamed of themselves if they behaved this way but not our daughter.

‘She is uncaring and cold and it’s about time she got severely punished, because she needs a wake-up call. Anybody who she comes into contact with she falls out with because something has gone missing.

'We’ve tried to help her, teachers have tried to help her, and psychologists have tried to help her. But it’s been no use. The thieving has gone on for donkeys years, and going to court was our last resort - we just couldn’t go on.’

Just weeks after the suspended sentence was imposed, Lynch stole cider, wine, lager, Malibu and vodka from four shops in Bacup, Lancashire between April 14 and May 4.

She was challenged twice, swore at one assistant, said: ‘Get out of my way’, and walked out of the premises.

Ten days after that, on May 14, she was given a chance to attend supervision appointments but on June 10, she pinched the charity box, containing cash for local mosques, and ran away.

It was later retrieved from behind the fridge at an address where she was staying. She was arrested and questioned and denied being responsible for each and every one of the thefts.

Lynch continued to claim she was not 
involved, even when shown CCTV - claiming shopkeepers were wrong.
She admitted six counts of theft and breaching the suspended custody term.

Mark Friend, defending, said his client had ‘had a very difficult relationship with her mother.’

He added: ‘For the last couple of weeks, for the first time in many years, the defendant and her mother have begun to make the tentative first steps towards building bridges in their relationship.

‘She tells me for the first time her mother is beginning to make arrangements for her to play an active and positive role in the lives of her children.’

Mr Friend said Lynch committed the thefts while subject to the suspended sentence because she wanted to go to prison, rather than feared it.

He said: ‘She was homeless. The idea of a roof over her head and three square meals a day was not something she was particularly fearful of.

'You have really thrown back at me the opportunity I gave you'

Judge Jonathan Gibson

'Now her life is beginning to turn around. She is all too aware of the difficulties she must overcome to build a stable and structured life for herself and her children.’

Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said she clearly had ‘multitudinous problems’, but had left him with little option. He said the final theft was committed after he gave her a last chance to comply with supervision. She will serve her sentence in a Young Offender Institution.

The judge added: ‘In effect, by committing that offence and attending only two supervision appointments, you have really thrown back at me the opportunity I gave you. It’s inevitable a custodial sentence must follow.’
