A hilarious sky snap of a cloud in the shape of a running man has gone down a storm with enthusiasts.Â 

The picture was voted one of Britain's 2013 clouds of the summer after it was spotted making a dash across the sky in May this year.

The uncanny cumulus, which only lasted a matter of seconds was captured 'running' over John o'Groats.

The striking formation was spotted by snapper Phil Holmes, who was standing on 
top of Duncansby Head, Caithness, Scotland at the time.

The
cloud became popular among pareidolia enthusiasts after Phil uploaded 
his picture to a website called the Cloud Appreciation Society.

It went on to be voted Britain's Cloud of the Summer despite it being the amateur's first sky photo.

The 64-year-old had been out walking 
with his wife on Duncansby Stacks when he spotted the hilarious 
formation and whipped out his camera.

Phil, of Newark, Nottinhamshire, said: 'I can't remember ever taking a picture of a cloud before so probably my first.

First place: The picture was voted Britain's Cloud of the Summer 2013 by a group of enthusiasts at the Cloud Appreciation Society

'It looked as if someone had painted the image of the running man onto the sky.

'It was very clear and very striking. I instinctively lifted the camera and with gloves on managed to take two shots before the cloud image then faded from our line of sight.

'It lasted only a few seconds so I was very lucky to be able to capture it. The gloves and being rocked by the wind didn't help.

'Initially, the image resembled Father Christmas, wading through the snow with his sack on his back, this then quickly progressed into the running man before then breaking down.

'With the cloud directly overhead John o' Groats it was as if Mother Nature was signalling her appreciation of all those thousands of runners who had set off on their marathon runs to Lands' End.'

When Phil returned home excitedly he uploaded the picture to the Cloud Appreciation Society and shared the image.

northern peak of Tunisia, the curve of west Africa and the distinct Horn
of Africa all clearly visible was spotted in Brockwell Park, Lonon, this summer

His lucky snap was hailed by cloud spotters, who affectionately labelled it 'Braveheart'.

The cloud runner is the latest in a series of strange sightings in our skies caused by funny shaped clouds.

The phenomenon of seeing recogniseable shapes in everyday or inanimate objects is known as 'pareidolia'.

It is not just limited to clouds, faces in frying pans, deities on doorhandles and animals made from tree branches all fall into the same category of illusion.

Other examples of cloud pareidolia which have been spotted this summer are cumulus clouds which looked like the British Isles and the African continent, and a dolphin like figure which was spotted 'diving' over the M11 in Essex.
