Matt Scott has demanded Scotland keep their emotions in check against England today as they look to avoid a repeat of last season’s Calcutta Cup humiliation.

The Scots were despatched with embarrassing ease at Murrayfield during the 2014 Six Nations, the 20-0 defeat leading to some commentators questioning whether they should remain part of the Championship.

Now, having lost their first three matches of this year’s tournament, Vern Cotter’s men head to Twickenham once again in dire straits and with a winless record at ‘HQ’ that stretches back to 1983.

However, Scotland centre Scott, recalled to the starting XV at the expense of the luckless Alex Dunbar, believes that the visitors can upset the odds - but only if they avoid the mistakes made 12 months ago.

‘The England game last year was horrible to look back on,’ he said. ‘It was a terrible overall performance.

‘I remember the boys being so fired up for that game and it is funny how we just completely went to pieces.

‘We didn’t play rugby at all back then so this weekend it’s about drip feeding that passion we felt last year but channelled in the wrong way. Last year, we had boys with tears in their eyes in the dressing room before the game.

‘It was an emotionally charged affair, but it’s a professional sport and it should all be about cool heads.

‘There’s a big focus for us on keeping cool this week because there’s a fine line between being like that and letting your emotions run away with you and we certainly crossed it in the wrong way last year.

‘I took that defeat really badly as it was probably the worst one of my career.

‘I remember the embarrassment of it all and that defeat has been used as motivation this week. There was a lack of structure to our attack, we were all over the place in parts. There was poor execution of kicks, poor decision-making, it just looked really disjointed.

‘We have watched clips this week and we know there are one or two points to prove.’

Scott also revealed that, should the Scots pull off what some would consider the impossible, they would dedicate the victory to stricken team-mate Dunbar.

The Edinburgh centre admitted he was ‘devastated’ for his close friend after Dunbar sustained a knee injury that could rule him out of this year’s Rugby World Cup.

‘I am sure it will be tough for Alex to watch knowing that he was meant to be playing in the match today,’ said Scott. ‘It would be a massive get well soon present for him from us if we can bring home the Calcutta Cup for him and that is what we will be trying to do.

‘There is a feeling in the camp of: “Let’s do this for him”. In professional rugby, guys do get long-term injuries but ones like Alex’s does bring us closer together in the sense we want to do well for him.

‘I was pretty close to Alex when he got injured on Thursday morning and it was the most innocuous thing as there was nobody near him when he pulled up.

‘The way it happened, he must have played it over in his head 100 times as he was extremely unlucky.

‘I am devastated for him and sent him a message straight after training saying I hoped it was good news but, unfortunately, it wasn’t.

‘In this period leading up to the World Cup you really don’t want anyone to get any long-term injuries. There is a chance he can still make the tournament so I am praying for him to make a speedy recovery.’

Scott, for all his honest sympathy and concern over Dunbar, knows his misfortune has given him a chance of making the No 12 jersey his own from now until the World Cup.

‘It has been a tough few months for me personally, not being selected and being injured,’ he continued. ‘Now I have a chance to start for Scotland and want to do my talking on the pitch.

‘I had a great run of starting a lot of games for Scotland earlier in my international career and I was very lucky to do that. Then got a bad injury and it took me a while to get back to where I was. Now, I feel I am back to where I was and am ready to fill Alex’s boots and do him proud.

‘I am pleased to be starting rather than being on the bench as most rugby players will say it is harder to come off the bench. Most games I have played professionally I have started, which is the way I like it.

‘If you are on the bench you don’t know if you are coming on in minute one or minute 79 so you are constantly on edge. At least this time out I can hit the pace of the game straight away.’
