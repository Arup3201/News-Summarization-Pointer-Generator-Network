She's the single mother of three who shot to infamy in 2013 when she appeared on the cover of a tabloid to brag about her free boob job under the headline: 'National Hooters Service'.

Nearly two years on and Josie Cunningham, aka the NHS boob job scrounger, has become a media sensation, regularly sparking outrage courtesy of off-colour comments on everything from breast feeding (incest apparently) to the identity of her third child's father.

But, she says, despite the lurid claims, she is far from being a scrounger and instead, is a loving, hard-working mother.

Notorious: Ms Cunningham shot to fame in 2013 when she spoke about her NHS boob job

Speaking on ITV's This Morning, where she debuted an eye-catching blonde new look, Ms Cunningham said she had worked since the age of 16 and is now self-employed.

'I'm far from a scrounger,' she insists. 'I have worked since I was 16 years old and I'm self-employed now.' 

Ms Cunningham was making the appearance ahead of a new documentary that follows her as she prepares give birth to baby daughter Grace.

In it, the Leeds 24-year-old is seen working with agent and former club promoter Rob Cooper as they orchestrate one media storm after another - usually via social media.

But while it might look tawdry, Ms Cunningham says her antics are all for a good cause - providing for her three children, Taylor, Harley and Grace.

'Eventually I would like to be in a position where I no longer have to do things in order to stabilise my children's future,' she explains in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'For now me and my kids are the priority, and that's all that matters.'

But making money for those children has seen her lurch from scandal to scandal, all faithfully documented via appearances on breakfast TV and tabloid splashes.

Ms Cunningham first came to prominence in early 2013, when she sold her first story. The tale, about how she, a single mother on benefits, came to be given a free boob job on the NHS, sparked instant outrage in a Britain just emerging from recession.

'I phoned up and told [The Sun] that I've had my boobs done on the NHS,' remembers Ms Cunningham. 'I said I want to be a glamour model and [the boob job] has changed my life.

'They seemed keen. Overly keen. Next thing I knew, I was on the front page as New Hooters Service. 

'I'd been portrayed completely opposite to what I was expecting, which was to encourage other young girls, to tell them that if you're depressed there's help there.'

She followed that appearance with another, this time on Page 3, which showed off the results of the operation and left little to the imagination.

Revelling in the furore, she then made a series of appearances in which she played on her new-found infamy, most notoriously when she stepped out topless with her nipples covered with NHS branded tape.

Along with media notoriety, the other result of her going public about her boob job has been a deluge of hate, both online and delivered via Royal Mail.

That it continues to this day, says Ms Cunningham, is the result of jealousy. 'I think it was originally about having my boobs on the NHS,' she explains.

'Now I think a lot of people hate the fact I've managed to gain a lot of media attention - people get jealous of that.'

She doesn't read unpleasant comments, saying that looking at them would 'just annoy me' but revels in the knowledge that she's doing nicely, thank you very much, out of the unending bile.

Nevertheless, Ms Cunningham does take exception to being described as 'the most hated woman in Britain' and says calling her workshy is wide of the mark as well.

Big plans: Ms Cunningham says she wants to feature in every lads' mag with 'my bangers out'

'I think I'm probably up there in the top ten most hated but I don't think it's justified,' she says. 'I understand why people criticise me as they've only seen one side to my personality. 

'After the documentary airs tonight, a few more people may warm to me.'

The documentary, Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain?, offers a snapshot into a life where domestic chores are juggled with headline-generating antics and where every foray onto Twitter results in a barrage of hatred.

In some respects, it's hard not to sympathise with Ms Cunningham, particularly when a man named Robin Armstrong, a 24-year-old salesman from Newcastle who describes himself as 'Josie's biggest hater' is brought on to comment.

Mr Armstrong, who posts daily expletive-laden videos of himself ranting about Ms Cunningham's latest doings, says she has earned every bit of the hate she gets.

'She is the most hated woman in Britain and she proves it day in day out,' he froths. 'Who would want to watch her give birth apart from her mother and one of the 55 potential dads? 

'She thrives off the hate. She just thrives off it. She's not bothered, she doesn't care. Because while we're all saying [rude things], she's making piles of money.'

Armstrong is certainly right about the latter. 'They think I'm sitting at home and crying but I'm not,' snaps Ms Cunningham.

'You can all hate me until the day I die. I'm going nowhere. Nowhere. For as long as I'm making a stable lifestyle and career out of this industry, I am not going nowhere.'

But while she might be making a decent living out of her notoriety, Ms Cunningham says she does have one ambition left for her to achieve.

'Where I want to end up is in every lads' mag with my bangers out,' she says, laughing. 'That can sound as trashy as it it wants but if you had no legs you would want to be Usain Bolt. 

'I've had no tits for 23 years and I want to be the next big glamour model.'
