A Midtown New York bar with a 'Wild West theme is being sued by former employees for allegedly encouraging customers to photograph staff members clad in bikinis and kissing, or even secretly recording them.

The ex-staffers at Johnny Utah's in New York's Rockefeller Center amended their existing class-action sexual harassment lawsuit against the bar's owners and managers on July 1 with new charges, according to media reports.

They include allegations that the titillating images are routinely posted on Twitter, Facebook and its own website by their bosses and customers without their consent.

The Manhattan federal court filing also alleges the bar's owners used cellphones and in-house security cameras to record the women, the New York Post reported. The footage includes video of women wrestling in kiddie pools filled with cranberry sauce.

The new complaint says Johnny Utah's proprietors then posted images on advertising billboards and to social media sites. 

Jeanne Christensen, the lawyer representing 23 of the former workers, said she hopes the lawsuit, originally filed June 17, helps end the practice of making such recordings in bars. 

The suit also says the women are required to drink shots of alcohol and kiss while riding the bar's flagship mechanical bull. The women ride the bull together as music plays and customers encourage them to snog.

If the women complain about doing these things, they risk having their hours cut or losing their jobs altogether, the lawsuit alleges. 

Destiny Frye, one of the plaintiffs, was 19 when she began working at the bar as a hostess. Despite her age, she and others were allegedly ordered to drink before riding the bull. 

The women say they were also ordered to party with two of the defendants, managers Thomas Casabona and JR Lozado, and their friends. 

The other defendants include the bar's owners, John Sullivan, who also owns McFadden's bar, and Robert Werhane.
