Two rare bottles of whisky salvaged from a shipwreck off Eriskay in 1941 which inspired a book and film Whisky Galore to be auctioned

A whisky collector has paid more than £12,000 for two bottles of now-undrinkable whisky salvaged from a shipwreck which inspired a book and a film.

The collectors' items were sold as a pair by Britain's biggest internet-only auction site Scotch Whisky Auctions, based in Glasgow, after more than a week of bidding which closed on Sunday.

The bottles, which have documents of authentication, were part of the cargo on the 8,000-ton cargo ship the SS Politician, which sank off the shores of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides in 1941 and inspired the book and film Whisky Galore.

They were bought by an unidentified UK buyer who fought off rival bids from collectors around the world to win the auction with his or her bid of £12,050.

Scotch Whisky Auctions director Bill Mackintosh said: 'I'm obviously very, very pleased for the people on whose behalf we sold it and I just think it's an incredible figure.

'It's not a whisky anybody's going to drink so they've bought it for its scarcity value and the fact that it's a fantastic part of Scotland's social history.'

He added: 'Everybody loves the idea of the wily islanders diving to the bottom of
the wreck and coming back up with bottles of whisky which they would then hide
from the customs.

'But it is true that there are only eight which have
have been authenticated recently and these are two of those which were sold at
Christie's some time ago.'

The eight bottles surfaced in 1987 when local man Donald
MacPhee from South Uist in the Outer Hebrides explored the wreck and found his
liquid treasure.

He sold them at auction with Christie's and got £4,000
for his loot.

Two of those bottles were bought by a man in Fraserburgh
in Aberdeenshire. He has recently died and his widow decided to sell them along
with the neck tags from Christie's and letters of authentication.

The 1949 film Whisky Galore told the tale of the Scottish islanders who took advantage of their unexpected windfall

The sinking of the SS Politician with thousands of bottles of alcohol on board was a godsend for the islanders who hadn't had a drink for months

Whisky Galore! was a 1949 Ealing comedy film based on the novel Whisky Galore by Compton MacKenzie.

The movie and the novel were inspired by the 1941 shipwreck of 8,000-ton cargo ship  S.S. Politician near the island of Eriskay and the unauthorised salvage of its cargo of whisky by islanders.

It starred Basil Radford, Bruce Seton, Joan Greenwood and Gordon Jackson.

The official documents from Christie's state: '2
bottles bottled by W & A Gilbey with original cork and wax sealed by
Christie's in plain glass with shoulder embossing stating, 'Federal law forbids
sale or re-use of this bottle'

A total of 28,000 cases of malt whisky were on board at
the time when the ship, sailing from Liverpool to the Jamaican capital of
Kingston and New Orleans in the US, crashed.

Islanders salvaged much of the cargo, including many
bottles of whisky, but only the eight from 1987 have been authenticated.

Mr Mackintosh added: 'This lot of two bottles is
incredibly scarce and provided a rare opportunity to obtain a real piece of
Scottish history.'
