Have you got repetitive strain injury from spending hours flicking through potential love interests on Tinder? Help is at hand.

A new dating concept called Grouper is aiming to get you off the sofa and out on a date - without the awkwardness of that first one-on-one encounter. So how does it work?

You sign up to the website, answer a few questions about yourself, let the company take a look at your Facebook profile before they match you with someone with similar interests.

A modern day Cilla Black? Grouper is a new dating concept that matches you with like-minded people based on your Facebook profile then sets you up on a date (you can even take your friends along)

You then pick two wingmen or women to 
take along with you to the chosen venue, pre-pay £15 each to make sure 
you all show up. Once you're there, Grouper even stumps up for the first
 round of drinks.

'It's like going to a bar but way better', they promise.

Grouper was founded in 2011 by Michael Waxman, a New York-based entrepreneur whose mission is 'to end loneliness'. And guess what? He found his current girlfriend on Grouper.

'I started Grouper when I first moved to New York as a way to meet new people,' he told DNA Info New York.

'Grouper has been a great way for our
 members to meet new friends, expand their social circles as well as 
start relationships,' he says.

And
 it seems that the site, which is now in 20 major cities across the US, has just launched an app 
and recently set up in London, is going down a storm with lonely hearts.

Research found that 96 per cent of people who go on a Grouper date want to go on another one.

The more the merrier: You pick two wingmen or women to take along with you to the chosen venue, pre-pay £12 each to make sure you all show up and Grouper even pay for the first round of drinks - the rest of the evening is in your hands

New friendships: Grouper aims to 'end loneliness' so whether you meet 'the one' or just expand your social circle, the new app hopes to help you have a good time

Speaking about the new dating concept, Kylie of The Online Dating Diaries, said: 'This sounds really exciting. I’d definitely be up for trying it out.

‘Taking a friend or two along to a group outing-type date really takes the pressure off and lets you concentrate on having a good time rather than keeping up with traditional dating etiquette the whole time.

‘It lets the other person see what you’re really like and vice versa. Also, this seems like a failsafe way to reduce the risk of having a fruitless experience.

‘If you don’t find true love, you’ll still probably have fun, and even if you have a horrible time you’re with your friends and an escape route won’t be hard to find.

‘Any modern-day single knows how much time can be lost enduring bad first dates.’
