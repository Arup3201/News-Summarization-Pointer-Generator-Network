PC Eileen Arthurs, 52, has been jailed for two and a half years for misconduct in a public office

A police officer has been jailed today after she accessed the police national computer database to help a friend who was once suspected of involvement in Britain's biggest ever cash robbery.

PC Eileen Arthurs, 52, lied to police about her friendship with Lee May, who was described as 'a man of interest' by detectives investigating the £52million robbery of a 
Securitas warehouse in Tonbridge, Kent, in 2006.

Arthurs
denied five charges of misconduct in a public office between 2004 and 
2012 but was convicted today by a jury at Maidstone 
Crown Court and jailed for two and a half years.

Divorcee Arthurs met Mr May when she sold her £760,000 house to him and the two became ‘at least’ friends.

The court heard at one stage she was even asked by senior police officers if she knew 'trustworthy' neighbours in the street who could help them with surveillance on Mr May’s house.

Lee May was never arrested or charged in connection with the robbery, and is not a police suspect in the case.

Arthurs was working in the community safety unit at North Kent police station in Northfleet.

Last year Mr May attended the police station to report someone was trying to kill him, giving a description of the car, an Audi, and its registration number.

The following day Arthurs told a colleague she had seen a black Audi and its occupants 'behaving suspiciously' on her way to work that morning.

She said she had kept a note of the car’s registration number which matched the one given by Mr May the previous day.

Arthurs obtained a print-out of the Audi’s details on the PNC (police national computer), including its history and registered owner.

She reported to her acting sergeant that the car’s registered owner was from Yorkshire and that the vehicle was 'probably dodgy'.

Senior officers had already been suspicious of her conduct and on her way home from work she was stopped by police and arrested.

Arthurs, from Bexley, Kent, was found to wrongly have the PNC print-out in her possession, and she had handwritten the same details on another piece of paper.

She admitted knowing Mr May and said her account of the Audi that morning was a 'complete fabrication'.

Judge Martin Joy told Arthurs, pictured arriving at court, that offences by officers 'seriously undermine the trust in the police service'

Investigating officers looking into 
the PC’s association with Mr May found this was not the first time she 
had been spoken to about using the PNC for non-policing purposes.

Between 2004 and 2005 Arthurs had used the Genesis police system to check the profile of Mr May.

In June 2005 she accessed information on a Michelle Stevenson listed on the database, a former partner of Mr May.

And in 2006 Arthurs checked the profile of Ian Tucker. He too was 'associated' with Mr May.

Arthurs was given a formal warning by the Professional Standards Department of Kent Police in 2008 to 'show a higher degree of honesty and integrity' when using the police system.

But she still failed to disclose her association with Mr May when submitting a vetting form to fellow officers in November 2011.

Prosecutor Matthew Jewell told the court: 'We know that PC Arthurs was aware of May’s status as a man of interest to police.

'She knew he had been linked to one of the biggest robberies, not just in Kent but in the UK.

'Investigating officers working on the Securitas robbery considered Lee May a person of interest, so much so that they wanted to set up an observation operation on his home.

'Officers discovered that PC Arthurs had connections to this address, namely she used to live in the house before May.

'An officer leading the Securitas case emailed Arthurs asking if she knew any trustworthy people in the street who they could contact in a bid to set up their surveillance operation.

'Arthurs replied saying that she did not, however she did assist in compiling a full layout of the house.'

Jailing her for two and a half years, Judge Martin Joy told Arthurs: 'You told lies to other officers, including superiors, perhaps to cover your tracks for your dishonest and criminal behaviour.

'This was an extended course of misconduct carried out over many years. The misuse of the computer relates to major criminals and not mundane matters.

'It is clear that misconduct by police officers such as committed by you seriously undermine the trust in the polices service which the public are entitled to.'

Arthurs joined Kent Police in June 2002 about a year after separating from her husband.

The court heard she was 'at least' friends with May - having regular and general contact, although she referred to him as a 'neighbour'.

Kent Assistant Chief Constable Gary Beautridge said: 'The vast majority of officers serve with the utmost integrity, honour and pride.

'It is important that those rare few who cross the line are dealt with appropriately and charged if an offence has been committed.'
