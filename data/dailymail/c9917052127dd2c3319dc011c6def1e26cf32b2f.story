On one side of the island there are the beautiful white beaches where the tourists are taken to cook freshly caught fish on the beach, eat tropical fruit and carouse until sunset to the sound of exotic birds chirping in the trees.

This is the part of Nusakambangan Island which the Indonesian Government promotes to visitors in flowery prose about walking through breathtaking rainforests, exploring caves and and enjoying the isolation from the rat race.

And travel bloggers who has visited the fringes of the island, otherwise known as Indonesia's Alcatraz, have raved about its stunning unspoiled beauty and how it was the perfect getaway for just a few days.

It is the other part of the island, 900km west of Bali, which runs like a grim spine through its centre, which will greet condemned drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran this week, when it becomes their home for just 72 hours before they executed by firing squad.

Indonesian authorities  confirmed on Monday night that Chan and Sukumaran will be transferred 'some time this week' to the island and held before they are shot dead.

Heaven: The bloggers who took these photographs of Nusakambangan island described it as a paradise and the perfect getaway for their brief holiday on its shores, saying 'I couldn’t believe my eyes. It’s been like a picture perfect shot from a catalogue or scenery from a movie'

Never mind death row: Travellers to Nuskambangan Island - the so-called 'death island' where Australian Bali 9 drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are due to be executed couldn't stop raving about its exotic scenery and different shades of blue water as (pictured)off a local boat carrying a traveller from Europe

Last meal: The group of 11 travelled to Nusa Kambangan by boat and then spent evenings cooking freshly caugh fish on open fires on beaches not far from the sinister interior of the island which houses Indonesia's most secure prison complex

The travellers raved about the fresh tropical fruit (pictured) which could be just plucked from the trees alongside beautiful beaches which were in abundance of the edge of Nusakambangan, an island in central Java 900km west of Bali

It's been confirmed that the Bali Nine leaders will be transferred to Nusa Kambangan this week to await their death

The other side: Inmates inside Batu Penjara, or stone prison, where up to 400 inmates are housed in filthy conditions in buildings which date back to the 1920s and Dutch occupation of Indonesia and is in the prison complex where Indonesian authorities have confirmed they will transfer the Australia Bali 9 inamtes Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran this week

Shakedown: An inmate is ordered out of the prison  to the verandah of Batu prison following a search of cells and common rooms to find heroin, cash, mobile phoes and dozens of shivs, or prison made weapons, which the inmates had been hiding in the ceiling and floors

Seething with unrest: The TV cameras catch the jail wide search of inamtes in January last year after a period of rioting and unreat following the transfer of a high profile convicted terrorist Pepi Fernando, one of dozens of terrorist inmates moved there for security

Hidden in thick, steamy raindforest in the island's centre are prisons like Batu Penjara. Grainy footage of the yard in Batu Penjara  jail on Nusakambangan Island, where Indonesia plans to execute the two Australians, shows a very different kind of 'paradise'.

Shot only a year ago at Batu, which means 'stone' prison, the film shows the prison choked with the smoke of burning fires.

Guards search squalid cells and shake down inmates in filthy common rooms where they have attempted, unsuccessfully, to conceal heroin, mobile phones, money and jail made 'shivs'.

The television report from Indonesia One TV network was filmed at a time when the prison was seething with unrest and violence following the transfer of an Islamic terrorist inmate Pepi Fernando, the 'book bomber' who masterminded a terror campaign of sending bombs in books to churches and other Christian targets.

Hope fading: Indonesian authorities confirmed on Monday night that Australians Myuran Sukumaran, 33 (left) and Andrew Chan, 31 (middle pictured in a cell in Denpasar, Indonesia will be moved from Bali to their like place n southern central Java

After climbing the moss-covered rocks throught the sense undergrowth of Nuskambangan's rainforest, the tourists raved that they had 'rarely seen trees of this height before' and they treasured the island's tranquility

Execution pending: Indonesian police pictured on January 17 this year as they tightened security at the main gate of maximum security prison Nusa Kambangan in Central Java province, prior to the scheduled execution of six drug convicts on January 18, including four foreigners

It provides an insight into what awaits Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, if Indonesia goes ahead with their planned executions.

Just a short boat ride from the the port of Cilacap which lies on the mainland of central southern Java , Nuskambangan houses six prisons, plus another five of which are in ruin and closed.

The Nusukambangan complex of prisons is regarded as the most secure in all of Indonesia.

It has not been announced which of the four Chan and Sukumaran will be taken to, reportedly to settle them in death row cells and give them at least 72 hours before their execution by firing squad.

Three of the island's prisons, Batu, Besi and Permisan, the oldest and said to take its name from the Dutch word for 'lost', were all build around a century ago.

Kembangkuning prison, built in 1950, and with a bright green exterior along its roadfront is said to be the most feared of the four with a heavy persence of terrorist inmates. Then there are Narkotika for drug offenders and Pasir Putuh, with a large holding capacity of up to around 500 prisoners.

A 2013 report listed 59 convicted terrorists among the inmates who had been transferred to the island because they were considered hardliners in need of close supervision.

Batu prison, which a capacity of around  400 inmates, was where the three Bali bombing terrorists, Amrozi, Muklas Imam Samudra, who killed 188 people on Bali in 2002,  were housed before their 2008 execution in an orange grove in the island's central plateau. 

The footage of Batu show prisoners inside the dilapidated and peeling 1925  facility, sitting in group holding cells and being dragged out, stripped of their contraband and rounded up for punishment.

Following a decision by the Indonesian Government to promote Nusakambangan as tourist destination, boatloads of visitors have made the trip to its shores.

'A pure white sandy beach surrounded by an outstanding rainforest. I’m glad we have some pictures to show, because words alone can’t describe this pearl of nature,' a tarvel group said on Nusakambangan (pictured, above)

On these shores, travellers found tranquility and beauty, but the island has a hidden interior of misery and death where executions are carried out in the middle of the night by firing squad

The enchanted tourists caught fish on the shores of Nusakambangan and discovered 'a huge variety of wildlife, endless beaches and tropical fruits'

Travel blog youkeepustravelling.com, said the 'beauty of a nearly unpopulated island' made their group of 11 people, including six Europeans find 'ourselves in the footpaths of Robinson Crusoe' on Nuskambangan

At the ferry they board a bus which takes in a drive past of several of the prisons, including Kembangkunig and Permisan, with its high concrete walls and razor wire around yards filled with death row inmates.

Some of the tourists who have described the island's atmosphere as 'gloomy'with 'many bird carcasses'.

But others rave about its splendid isolation and its beauty despite the fact it is a prison island, the correctional facilities hidden in the forest away from the beaches and the barbecues.

'I never imagined to find what I was seeking for on an island also known as the Alcatraz from Indonesia. Home for murderer, terrorists and drug dealers. Indonesians most dangerous criminals will surely come across Nusa Kambangan,' the blog reads.
