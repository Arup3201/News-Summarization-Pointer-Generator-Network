Online matchmaking, singles' nights, speed dating, dating apps, blind dates... when did finding love become such an almighty palaver?

Wouldn't it be easier if you could just spot the nearest singleton a mile off? Or, at least, some 10 metres off? Perhaps if they were wearing, say, a recognisable 'I'm free!' wristband?

It may sound preposterous, but that's precisely the thinking behind a new loved-up start-up powered by Danish-British couple Rina Mardahl and Rob Young, whose whirlwind romance and continued relationship inspired the MY Single Band - named MY after the partners' surnames - a coloured rubber bracelet with which they hope to unite singles all over the world.

The new MY Single Band bracelet aims to take some of the complication out of looking for love, enabling singletons to easily spot each other

The British-Danish collaboration behind MY Single Band recognised the difficulty in meeting other singles and set about creating a single identifier that would appeal to the mass market

Launching now in the UK and in America in a few weeks, Rina and Rob say the band should help 'increase new encounters, lower the fear of first introductions, and suit busy modern lifestyles'.

Claiming the bands could 'change the face of dating forever', they continue: 'The launch of MY Single Band is a revolutionary concept. When worn, the band visibly identifies that the wearer is single, just like a wedding ring shows you are married.

'MY Single Band not only impresses upon others that there is so much choice out there, but also where that choice lies.'

The couple say they recognised the difficulty in meeting other singles and set about 'creating a single identifier that would appeal to the mass market'.

The silicone wristbands, priced £6 for one or £10 for two, are designed in seven different colours and embossed with the words fate, destiny and future.

Speaking to MailOnline, Rob said: 'We
recognised that as the population of single adults continues to rise across
every age group, they need new and innovative ways to connect.

'Online dating
provides one method but cannot measure chemistry and it doesn’t help when you
are out and about, which is of course most of the day.

'Whilst working at my previous office of 3,500 people, I realised that I saw hundreds of
people each day that could potentially be a suitable partner, yet there was no
way of knowing their relationship status.'

The new colourful wristbands enable you to identify a potential date's availability without having to ask

Rob and Rina met on holiday in Lanzarote, and their relationship is now both personal and professional

The couple talked about how lucky they had been to bump into each other on holiday in Lanzarote, but and 'how so many people must miss out on
meeting their soul mate by not saying the first hi'.

Rob continued: 'We began to question the
laid back approach to meeting other singes that most of us take and decided
that a single identifier would be of huge benefit to singles.'

The couple built the website mysingleworld.com to promote MY Single Band but
also to provide a central resource for single people.

'There's a tendency to
think of the notion "single and alone", yet we want to promote "single and
together".

'There are literally hundreds of millions of singles, yet finding one
for you has always been comparable to a needle in a haystack.

'Yet it was always
going to be hard when single, as a relationship status, is visually completely
invisible.

'With MY Single Band you don’t have to go looking for single
hot-spots, just wear the attractive band and your perfect partner could be just
around the next corner.'
