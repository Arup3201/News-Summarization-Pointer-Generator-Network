Shares in British banks soared yesterday 
after the Government outlined a dramatic plan to pump £140billion into 
the ailing economy.

Stock in state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland rose
nearly 8 per cent and part-nationalised Lloyds Banking Group went up by
more than 5 per cent, adding £2.1billion to the value of taxpayers’ 
holdings in the two banks.

Barclays was up more than 4 per cent.

But
the jump in bank shares raised fresh questions about whether the banks 
could end up being the main  beneficiaries of the scheme, which is meant
to force them to lend more money directly to cash-strapped small 
businesses and homeowners.

The mini surge came after the Treasury and
the Bank of England joined forces to launch two packages to stimulate 
the economy and tackle the crisis spilling over from the eurozone.

Last
night Chancellor George Osborne was also facing questions about whether
the taxpayer could be left with a fresh bill if the new loans turn bad.

Tory
MP Steve Baker, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, 
said: ‘It’s more or less explicit that the reason the Government is 
stepping in to force lending is because their loans are to the type of 
businesses they would otherwise not make.

‘That means it’s a bad risk and I think that means the taxpayer could well end up picking up the can.’

Fellow
Tory David Ruffley gave a cautious welcome to the scheme but urged Mr 
Osborne to be upfront about the risks of the taxpayer being landed with 
new ‘sub-prime’ loans.

Mr Ruffley, a member of the Commons Treasury 
committee, said: ‘New lending will only happen if the commercial banks 
take advantage of this cheap money to lend on.

‘Some banks will only
do so if the taxpayer covers losses when their customers default or go 
bust. Is the British taxpayer prepared to stand behind these cheap 
loans?

Graham Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors,
said the Chancellor and Governor of the Bank of England were right to 
act.

But he warned that the ‘core problem’ remained the uncertainty 
caused by the eurozone crisis. ‘The funding-for-lending scheme helps the
supply of money and the demand for it, by lowering the cost of 
borrowing,’ he said.

‘But the core problem remains. Companies alarmed by the euro crisis will not be eager to borrow regardless of the cost.’

Britain's biggest bank will hammer  millions of cash-strapped families by  hiking the cost of slipping into the red.

State-backed giant Lloyds will make 17million customers pay 20 per cent more to set up an overdraft and is raising rates to a whopping 19.94 per cent.

The new rate is the highest charged by any of the big five banks and makes dipping into your overdraft more expensive than spending on a credit card.

Experts say the hikes, which take effect on October 2, are unfair on loyal customers battling record low savings rates and a painful income squeeze. And they come despite the Bank of England freezing the base rate at its historic low of 0.5 per cent for more than three years.

Marc Gander, founder of campaigners Consumer Action Group, said: ‘This is a nasty, cynical move and is catastrophic for families, who are being forced to rely on overdrafts far more because of a financial crisis created by the banks.’

Lloyds is Britain’s biggest provider of current accounts with 22million customers including its Halifax arm.

With the financial crisis in the eurozone spilling into Britain, bank profits have come under threat. As a result, they are trying to squeeze more out of customers who run out of cash at the end of the month.

Currently, Lloyds customers who arrange to have an overdraft pay between 12.43 and 19.28 per cent, depending on the type of account they are in. Customers also pay £5 a month for the right to be overdrawn.

From October, the rates on all accounts will increase to a minimum of 15.43 per cent, rising as high as 19.94 per cent. The monthly cost increases to £6.

Those hit with the biggest interest rate are customers in Lloyds’ Classic account. This is a free account and is most likely to be used by cash-strapped customers.

It means that on each £1,000 borrowed for a year, they will pay £199.40 before any debt is scratched off.

Injection: The Bank of England is to pump up to £140bn - or one in every five pounds of total Government spending - in to the UK economy in a bid to stimulate lending

Big decision: The scheme was approved by the 'quad' of senior ministers; Danny Alexander, David Cameron, George Osborne and Nick Clegg

Banks will be lent the cash on condition they pass it on in the form of cheaper business loans and mortgages. 

Ministers
say the intervention will ease the credit drought starving small 
businesses and home buyers of cash. The initiative is also designed to 
protect our banks against fallout from the eurozone crisis by giving 
them easy access to cash from the Bank of England.

But some Tory 
Right-wingers questioned the idea of trying to stimulate the economy by 
pouring billions more into cheap loans. Tory MP Douglas Carswell 
described the policy as ‘continuity Gordon Brown’. He added: ‘This is 
precisely the sort of medicine that made the economy sick in the first 
place.’

David Jones, strategist at City trading firm IG Index, said: 
‘Investors have broadly welcomed this move as an effort to try and 
insulate at least some of the UK economy and banking sector from further
fallout from the European debt crisis.

‘However, whether this will 
end up having a significant impact on the underlying UK economy is 
debatable – the reluctance of banks to lend is arguably just a small 
part of the overall economic malaise.’

Supporters: Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, left, and Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott have backed the initiative
