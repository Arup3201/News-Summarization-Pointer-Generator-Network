The Mail on Sunday makes public for the first time this exclusive image of a key meeting that World Cup bidding whistleblower Phaedra Almajid says was the start of Qatar 2022’s strategy to set up an alliance with the Spain-Portugal 2018 bid team for their mutual benefit in the bidding process.

It was taken by Almajid, who was integral in her then role within the bid team to arranging this meeting in October 2009, one of many stops on a global tour designed to win support and make alliances to help Qatar’s cause. 

Bid CEO Hassan Al-Thawadi’s father had been a Qatari diplomat in Spain when Al-Thawadi was young; Al-Thawadi had good connections within Spanish business if not football and Almajid says his acquaintanceship with well-connected local businessman Jaime Fluxa was vital. 

The Qatari delegation had flown into Spain the night before the photo was taken and were staying at the luxury Gran Melia Fenix hotel, where top rooms cost £2,500 a night.

They were at the meeting, one of series of engagements with Real Madrid officials over three days, to talk about possible ‘strategic relationships’ between Qatar and Real Madrid — and to lobby for an introduction to the most powerful man in Spanish football, FIFA ExCo member Angel Maria Villar Llona.

Among those who met with the Qatari group were Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, executive director Jose Angel Sanchez, and director of strategic planning Ivan Bravo.

Villar Llona has close ties across Spanish football, and South America, and Qatar 2022’s strategy paid off when he met senior Qatar officials, although not on this trip, and, Almajid says, agreed to form a vote-swap alliance.

‘That was THE point of this particular trip to Spain,’ Almajid told the Mail on Sunday. ‘To get to Villar Llona. To set up this alliance.’ 

Spain and Qatar have always denied any vote-swap collusion. Neither have responded to questions on the matter.

The Qatar bid team’s travels subsequently took them to Malaysia in November 2009, then South Africa. They then announced former Argentina striker Gabriel Batistuta as a bid ambassador, and, Almajid says, they used him as a link to senior executives in Argentina, where there was another ExCo voter.

In December 2009 the bid team were in Abu Dhabi, meeting Egypt’s ExCo voter Hany Abo Rida. Then in January the Qatar 2022 team sponsored the annual congress of the African Confederation (CAF) in Angola, where Qatar’s own FIFA ExCo voter, Mohamed bin Hammam made his first official appearances as a Qatar 2022 figurehead.

By February, they were back in Spain, in Barcelona, announcing Barca manager Pep Guardiola as a bid ambassador. On that trip, senior Qatar official Tariq Al Naama met Villar Llona. ‘The vote deal was then sealed,’ Almajid says.

In October 2010, Villar Llona passed a note to Bin Hammam at an ExCo meeting in Zurich. A brief FIFA probe into alleged collusion, just weeks before the December 2010 vote on the 2018 and 2022 hosts, had found ‘insufficient’ evidence to take any action. The note read: ‘Congratulations, vamos a ganar’ — or ‘Congratulations, we are going to win.’

FIFA president Sepp Blatter told the BBC in February 2011: ‘I’ll be honest, there was a bundle of votes between Spain and Qatar.’ But both nations have always denied there was any vote pact.

A Qatar 2022 spokesman said: ‘We have always been confident of our position and stand by the integrity and quality of our bid. We continue to focus on delivering a historic World Cup in the Middle East.’

Villar Llona declined to be involved at all in Michael Garcia’s investigation into alleged corruption in the 2018 and 2022 process.

Almajid, in the room on many occasions as Qatar sought to land sport’s greatest event, is convinced their path to an unlikely victory began in the photo on this page. ‘In my mind there is no question about it,’ she says.
