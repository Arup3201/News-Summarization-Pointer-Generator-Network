A father-of-six is in a critical condition after plunging from balcony while on a family holiday in Tunisia.

Karl Nethercot had been enjoying a drink while on the break in the North African country with fiance Emma Huszarik and their two children, aged seven months and 20 months, when he fell from their apartment.

The 35-year-old suffered severe head and chest injuries and is fighting for his life in a Tunisian hospital bed.

Critical condition: Family of Karl Nethercot, who is currently in hospital in Tunisia, are desperately trying to raise £20,000 to bring him home to the UK after discovering his holiday insurance does not cover the medical flight

And to add to his distraught family's torment, they have now had to launch a desperate appeal to raise £20,000 needed to bring him home after discovering his holiday insurance does not cover the cost of the medical flight to the UK.

Fundraising events in his home town of Netherfield, Nottinghamshire, have so far raised £450 and a Facebook page has been set up to plea for more donations.

Speaking from his bedside in Port El Kantaoui, Ms Huszarik, 32, she told how the dream family holiday turned into a nightmare.

She said: 'I'm absolutely devastated and have cried numerous times. If it wasn't for my family out here helping me with the kids I would be in pieces.

'The massive help from people in Nottinghamshire is overwhelming and I'm truly touched by how many people care for this family.

'We are all strong people and Karl is such a big strong lad. He has to make it for the sake of all his beautiful children.'

His
sister-in-law Samantha Davison, 24, said: 'Karl is such a kind man, He 
would do anything for anyone. It is killing us all knowing that we can't
go and see him because he's in a foreign country.

'Please help us bring him home.'

The
care assistant and mother-of-one added: 'I'm absolutely gutted.

'I still
don't think that it has properly hit us yet. I'm really close to Karl 
and I always go to him to talk if I have a problem or need cheering up.

'He's
a fantastic guy and just never sits still. He's an amazing dad and 
works so hard for his children.

'We all just want him home so we can care
for him.'

Sign-fitter Karl is also father to four other children - Aidan, 14, Leyton, 12, Sheldon 10, and Kylan, 8, who live in Netherfield.

Miss
Davison added: 'As far as we know, Karl was on the balcony having a 
drink and then the next thing he had fallen.

'He was rushed to hospital 
and put into a medically induced coma on October 2 because he had 
suffered severe injuries to his head and chest.

'The doctors have said he will be in a
coma for a few more days and the situation is still critical. To fly 
him back to Nottingham will cost £20,000, which we just don't have.

'We're asking people to give what they can, no matter how little it is, to help bring Karl home.'

It is thought Mr Nethercot had travel insurance but it did not cover the expenses of a medical flight.

Miss Davison added: 'Everyone is just in shock. Ethan is at the age where he knows something is wrong with his dad and I imagine he is struggling to understand. We just all want him back here safe and sound and on the mend as soon as possible.'

The family have already held a fundraising event at the Vale Social Club in Colwick, which raised £450 and have set up a Facebook page where people can donate called Please Pray and Keep Karl Nethercot in Our Thoughts.

Miss Davison added: 'Karl is such a kind man, he would do anything for anyone. It is killing us all knowing that we can't go and see him because he's in a foreign country. Please help us bring him home.
