Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani is on the verge of losing his fight against extradition to South Africa for allegedly ordering the killing of his wife.

South Africa’s justice department has agreed he will not be kept in custody and can return to Britain after a year if he is too mentally ill for trial – a condition imposed by the UK High Court.

Dewani, 33, is being detained under the Mental Health Act and suffers post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Doctors have told a series of hearings that a prognosis is not certain.

Shrien Dewani, 33, is on the verge of being extradited to South Africa to face allegations that he ordered the killing of his newlywed wife Anni (left) while the pair were on their honeymoon

He would normally be kept in custody indefinitely if unfit to stand trial.

Dewani now has until March 7 to lodge an appeal.

He is accused of paying hitmen the equivalent of £1,500 to hijack a taxi in which he was travelling through Cape Town in November 2010 with his wife, Anni, 28.

Dewani and the driver were let go, while Anni was shot dead. He maintains his innocence.
