Being at the cutting edge of technology comes at a price - and in the TV world, it turns out to be £20,000.

Sony today took the wraps of the biggest ever 4K TV ever made, with an 84inch screen.

4K, currently only widely used in cinemas, has four times as many pixels as a normal HD TV.

Sony's snappily named KD-84X9005 TV, which boasts an 85 inch screen that can show pictures four times sharper than HD - if you can find anything in the new format to watch

It has yet to catch on as so far, there is very little in the new format to watch.

The 84-inch TV represents a "major step forward," said Kaz Hirai, CEO of Sony, speaking at a news conference.

'It's an unprecedented and revolutionary viewing experience,' Hirai said. 'The experience is so immersive, you want to touch everything in front of you.'

David Fincher's The Social Network was one of the first to be shot and screened in 4K, and an increasing number of cinema films use the format.

However, it is widely expected to eventually replace HD as the standard for films and other entertainment.

Sony's new TV is one of the first, and the biggest, to hit the market. 

Sony boasts that, like the iPhone's display, is it so clear individual pixels are impossible to distinguish.

'With its beautiful, large high-resolution screen and high-quality powerful sound, viewers can enjoy immersive experiences unlike anything offered by existing televisions, as if they were at a live entertainment venue or in a movie theater,' the firm said.

It also comes with ten speakers, and can show pictures as well as video.

The TV also boasts ten speakers, and will be on sale later this year

However, as with all technology, there is always something better around the corner - and the BBC has already filmed test content at the Olympics using a 'super hi-def' 8K format even better than Sony's.

The Japanese firm is the first to show if its products at the IFA technology show in Berlin, Sony also unveiled a new tablet computer called the Experia Tablet S designed to take on the iPad and Microsoft's new Surface tablet.

It runs Google's Android software, as it expected to be available within weeks.

Sony also showed off a touchscreen computer called the Tap 20, which is a 20 inch touchscreen that can either be used a normal PC or laid flat to be used as a touchscreen for multiplayer games.

The firm showed off the tablet with a range of software including a painting game.

It will run Microsoft's new Windows 8 software.

The Tap 20, a 20 inch PC launched today by Sony, than can used as a traditional PC or a 'giant iPad' when laid on its back.
