Batsman Nick Compton has returned to Middlesex with an eye on kickstarting his England career.

Compton, 31, started his professional career at Lord's, where his grandfather Denis made his name, but left for Somerset in 2009.

His spell at Taunton saw Compton reach new heights, scoring more than 5,000 first-class runs at an average of 55.86 during his five seasons with the county and earning nine Test caps.

Angus Fraser, director of cricket at Middlesex, is delighted that Compton has returned

He left by mutual consent this summer having slipped off the international radar entirely, despite having signed a new three-year deal in 2013, and there was some doubt over whether or not he would return to county cricket at all.

But having relocated to London, he found a willing director of cricket in Angus Fraser, who signed the opener until the end of 2017.

'We are delighted to welcome Nick back to Middlesex CCC,' said Fraser.

'Players of Nick's ability do not become available very often and when we were made aware of his desire to move back to London we immediately moved.

'I was in charge at Middlesex CCC when Nick left at the end of the 2009 season and, even though I could at the time totally understand his reasons for moving to Taunton, I was disappointed when he left.

'It will be great to see him once again wearing a Middlesex cap and sweater, and I believe he has a lot to offer us both on and off the field over the course of the next five or six years.'

While Middlesex see Compton as an experienced head to lead the batting order while Chris Rogers spends most of his summer on Ashes duty with Australia, Compton has not given up hope of persuading England he can play a part in the same series.

And with Fraser as a selector, he is certainly in the right place.

Compton said: 'The time I spent at Taunton was great for me. I also fulfilled the dream of representing England, which is something I am determined to do again.

'Returning to Middlesex CCC as a senior player is an exciting challenge for me, one I am really looking forward to. Lord's is the home of cricket and with my family ties here the time feels right to return home.'
