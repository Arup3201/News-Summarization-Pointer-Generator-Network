Controversial footage claiming to show the wreckage of an Israeli drone shot down near an Iranian power plant has been aired on television in Iran.

The video has prompted questions about how a plane with limited range could have penetrated so deeply into the country and whether it is indeed what Tehran says it is.

The brief clip showed what the channel described as parts of the battleship-gray drone scattered in an unidentified desert area. The unmanned device was identified as a Hermes 450, a known Israeli model.

This photo, released by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, claims to show the wreckage of an Israeli drone shot down by Iran near a nuclear site, 150 miles south of Tehran

There were no visible Israeli markings on the aircraft, a Hermes 450,  in the footage and Israel's military has refused to comment on the matter

There were no visible Israeli markings on the aircraft and Israel's military has refused to comment on the matter.

The claim comes as Iran negotiates with world powers over its contested nuclear program and Iranian hard-liners press moderate President Hassan Rouhani to demand more concessions before limiting the country's atomic capabilities.

The West suspects Iran's nuclear program is geared toward building a nuclear weapon - however the country denies the charge, saying its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes only, such as power generation and medical research.

Israel has not ruled out taking unilateral military action against Iran's nuclear facilities.

Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard said in a statement on Sunday that its forces fired a missile as the drone neared Iran's uranium enrichment facility in Natanz,150 miles south of the capital, Tehran. 

Guard spokesman General Ramazan Sharif also said that Iran allowed the drone to continue its path to find out more about its mission.

General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard's airspace division, has insisted the drone was Israeli, though he said its last flight originated elsewhere

General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Guard's airspace division, insisted on Monday that the drone was Israeli, though he said its last flight originated elsewhere.

He said: 'The operational range of the drone indicates it did not start its flight in Israel but departed from a country in the region. We have some clues.'

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham condemned the drone's presence as a violation of Iranian territorial integrity and said 'pursuing the case in legal and international bodies is our right', the semi-official Fars news agency reported.

Mr Hajizadeh said the drone's range was about 500 miles and that it had two front and side cameras capable of providing high-resolution panoramic imaging.

However, the manufacturer of the Hermes 450, Israel-based Elbit Systems, lists its base range as only 200 miles.

Israel is about 620 miles away from Iran's westernmost boundary and Natanz is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. 

Other countries also operate Hermes 450 drones, including Britain, the United States and Azerbaijan, Iran's neighbor to the north.

Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard (pictured above testing missiles in 2006) believe the drone was launched by Israel from another country in the region

Iranian state-linked media previously touted Iranian-made drones that bore some resemblance to the Israeli model. 

According to British aviation expert Paul E. Eden, this could be what is shown in the footage.

Mr Eden said it is possible that the Israeli drone could operate beyond its official range, but he too was skeptical given how far into Iranian airspace the drone would have penetrated.

He said: 'If this seems to be posing a threat, you don't let it fly for hundreds of miles. It doesn't ring true.'

Israel considers Iran's nuclear program to be a grave threat, and Israeli intelligence closely monitors the program.

Iran's nuclear program has been targeted by espionage and sabotage efforts in the past. 

In 2010, the so-called Stuxnet virus temporarily disrupted operation of thousands of centrifuges, key components in nuclear fuel production, at Natanz.

Iran says it and other computer virus attacks are part of a concerted effort by Israel, the U.S. and their allies to undermine its nuclear program through covert operations. 

Israel has never commented on the allegations but is widely believed to have been involved in the Stuxnet attack.

Iran has also said that it discovered tiny timed explosives planted on centrifuges but disabled them before they could go off.
