Pebble's Time smartwatch has already raised more than £12.8 million ($19.1 million) on Kickstarter - with a week to go - and now the firm wants to give some of these funds back to you. 

The watchmaker has launched a scheme hoping to encourage designers to build their own 'smartstraps' for its new watch.

It will pay up to £637,000 ($1 million) to help develop the best designs and has unveiled a prototype example that can turn the watch into a standalone device.

Pebble has launched a scheme hoping to encourage designers to build their own 'smartstraps' for its new watch. It will pay up to £637,000 ($1 million) to help develop the best designs and has unveiled a prototype example by Spark.io (pictured) that connects the watch to a mobile network

This strap, designed by Spark.io, features a 'cellular development kit' meaning the watch can connect directly to a mobile network.  

It is just a prototype at the moment, and the exact functionality hasn't been revealed, but this would reduce the Pebble Time's reliance on a connected phone, for example. 

Another example strap presented by Pebble is Seeed Studio’s  modular strap that lets wearers add different functions.

It works in a similar way to Google's Project Ara modular phone and people can add and replace components, adapters and other accessories. 

Pebble has now published 3D printing files and released details about the watch's connectors to help designers create the bespoke straps. 

The Time smartwatch is Pebble's third product, but the first to feature a colour screen.

Pebble has now published 3D printing files and released details about the watch's connectors (shown) and circuit boards to help designers create bespoke straps. It has not revealed how the funds will be distributed

It raised more than £5.8 million ($9 million) in its first day on the site and has more than 74,700 backers. The campaign ends on 28 March and the device will ship by July.  

Pebble Time beat the previous overall funding record of £8.7 million ($13.3 million) set by the Coolest Cooler, a drinks cooler that comes with a built-in blender, wireless speaker and USB charging points. 

Pebble's original smartwatch is third on the all-time list, having raised more than £6.5 million ($10 million) after having an initial funding goal of £65,000 ($100,000).

The Time smartwatch comes with a colour e-paper screen similar to the technology used on e-readers such as the Amazon Kindle, with Pebble promising up to seven days battery life as a result. The watch is also water resistant.

Pebble's Time raised more than £5.8 million ($9 million) in its first day on Kickstarter and more than 74,700 people have backed the campaign, which ends on 28 March. Its current total is £12.8 million ($19.1 million)

The Time will have a retail price of £129 ($199) once the Kickstarter campaign ends, but those who choose to fund the Time have been able to pre-order the wearable device for less. 

At the Mobile World Congress technology show in Barcelona earlier this month, Pebble announced it would also be selling a high-end Steel version of the Time that would cost around £160 ($245), and look similar to the premium version of the Apple Watch.

Pebble Time beat the previous overall funding record of £8.7 million ($13.3 million) set by the Coolest Cooler (pictured), a drinks cooler that comes with a built-in blender, wireless speaker and USB charging points - and there are still 23 days of funding to go in Pebble's Kickstarter
