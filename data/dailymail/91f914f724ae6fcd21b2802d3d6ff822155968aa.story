Experts say champagne tastes better when served in an ordinary wine glass

When toasting a special occasion with a bottle of bubbly, classy champagne flutes are the obvious choice for many.

And while it may go against tradition, experts are urging drinkers to ditch their crystal flutes in favour of an ordinary wine glass.   

This is because higher-end brands will taste better in a broader glass, according to wine connoisseurs.

Frederico Lleonart, a global wine ambassador for drinks company Pernod Ricard, says a simple wine glass emphasises the aroma and fizz in better and more complex champagnes. 

'When the sparkling wine or champagne has complexity, depth and autolytic notes, such as the best cavas or champagnes, then the best option is actually to use a white wine glass in order to let the aromas express themselves better,' he told The Sunday Telegraph.

But simple sparkling wines should still be served in flutes as it keeps the drink colder for longer and shows off the bubbles better.

'Both the flute and the saucer help the aromas diffuse in different ways: the flute concentrates carbon dioxide at the top of the glass, whereas the saucer's wide mouth means the bubbles evaporate more quickly,' he added. 

And Richard Geoffroy, Dom Pérignon's Chef de Cave has long sworn by white wine glasses for serving his champagnes because flutes can stifle the flavour of older wines.

He said: 'I tend to use any glass which is ample enough to allow the wine to express itself, improving the mouthfeel, but not that large a glass that it would be detrimental to the whole experience by stretching the substance of the wine too thin. 

'Such a glass will also provide enough space for the wine to breathe and develop, which is typically critical for all Dom Pérignon wines.' 

But studies have suggested flutes are better choice for champagne because they provide more of a 'nose-tingle' than if served in wide and shallow 'coupe'. 

A study by the University of Reims in France found that champagne tastes different depending on the glass you drink it from.

And bubbly poured into a long narrow flute gives more of a nose-tingle due to high levels of carbon dioxide at the top of the glass. 

Another study by the same university said champagne should be served at room temperature because it has more bubbles.

The study found champagne keeps its fizz for longer if served slightly warmer at around 18°C.
