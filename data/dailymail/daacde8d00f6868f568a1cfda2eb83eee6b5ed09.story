U2 frontman Bono revealed today he has suffered from glaucoma for two decades - hence his permanent sunglasses

Many assumed the dark glasses worn by U2 frontman Bono were a fashion statement.

But he has revealed the reason he dons shades is because he has suffered from glaucoma for years.

The star said he has suffered the eye condition – which if left untreated can cause vision impairment and even blindness - for around two decades.

Until now, people put the singer's ever-present sunglasses – which he even wore indoors – were a rock star affectation.

But he explained during a recording of tonight's Graham Norton Show for BBC1 that they are to help with his vision problem.

Glaucoma can make the eyes more sensitive to light, causing sufferers to use dark glasses to alleviate difficulties.

Presenter Mr Norton asked whether the singer ever removes his shades, to which Bono replied: 'This is a good place to explain to people that I've had glaucoma for the last 20 years.

'I have good treatments and I am going to be fine.'

He added: 'You're not going to get this out of your head now and you will be saying "Ah, poor old blind Bono". 

Glaucoma is caused by a build-up of pressure in the eyeball when the fluid in the eye cannot drain properly, which can damage the optic nerve.

If left untreated, it can lead to loss of peripheral vision and ultimately complete loss of sight. 

Early diagnosis can mean further sight deterioration can be prevented - with laser treatment, eye drops and surgery used to stop it worsening - but the damage to the optic nerve cannot be undone.

Several things increase the risk of developing glaucoma.

Age: Glaucoma becomes much more common as we get older. It is uncommon below the age of 40 but this type of glaucoma affects one per cent of people aged over 40. About five per cent of people over the age of 65 have glaucoma

Race: If you are of African origin you are more at risk of glaucoma. It is also more likely to develop at an earlier age and be more severe 

Family: you are at a higher risk of developing glaucoma if you have a close relative who has chronic glaucoma

Short sight: If you are very short sighted you have a higher risk of developing chronic glaucoma 

Diabetes: If you have diabetes you have an increased risk of developing glaucoma.

For the most common type of glaucoma, there are no noticeable symptoms because the condition develops very slowly. 

People often do not realise their sight is being damaged because the first part of the eye to be affected is the peripheral vision.

Vision is lost from the outer rim of the eye, slowly working inwards towards the centre. 

The Irish band were on the Graham Norton show to promote their new album, Songs Of Innocence.

The song was released commercially this week after previously being given away to half a billion iTunes customers, a controversial move which upset some people who said they did not want it automatically added to their music libraries.

Speaking about the furore, Bono told Mr Norton: 'We wanted to do something fresh but it seems some people don't believe in Father Christmas.

'All those people who were uninterested in U2 are now mad at U2. As far as we are concerned, it's an improvement.' 

Bono revealed that the shades he continually wears help alleviate the symptoms of glaucoma. He is pictured here with Apple CEO Tim Cook during the Apple launch last month
