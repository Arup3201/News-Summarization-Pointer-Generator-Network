Edie Littlefield Sundby told MailOnline that government-run health insurance is a recipe for disaster, and tweaked White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer for his 'snotty' tweet undermining her story

Edie Sundby, the 62 year-old California cancer survivor who made a powerful intervention into the Obamacare controversy with a stinging Wall Street Journal op-ed told MailOnline today blasted the 'snotty' tweet by a White house aide that attempted to undermine her moving story.

White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer sparked outrage on Monday by tweeting a link to a liberal blog post that claimed Sundby – who passionately described how she suffers under the changes of the Affordable Care Act – only lost her health insurance because of corporate greed.

Pfeiffer operates an 'official' White House Twitter feed, meaning that he speaks for the administration whenever he posts messages there.

Sundby said his tweet in response to her touching essay was 'snotty,' but then thanked Pfeiffer for pointing her to 'some information that I was not privy to.'

Sundby, who has battled her cancer since 2007, explained in the op-ed that she is 'one of the losers' in the president's signature health insurance overhaul.

Her existing care has allowed her to outlive doctors' expectations by more than five years already. The beauty products entrepreneur and yoga devotee hikes daily to keep her body's defenses up. But her physicians are her first line of defense.

Cancer specialists at Stanford have 'kept me alive,' she wrote, 'but UCSD has provided emergency and local treatment support during wretched periods of this disease, and it is where my primary-care doctors are.'

Dan Pfeiffer, the White House Communications Director, tweeted out a liberal organization's hit piece on Sundby's insurance company -- he used his 'official' Twitter account which speaks for the administration

Sundby says government shouldn't be trusted to run health care for the entire nation, since it can't effectively run the DMV and it's already broken Americans' trust by raiding the Medicare and Social Security trust funds

Both hospitals, and the doctors who practice in them, are covered by her current PPO. But Covered California, the state's Obamacare insurance exchange, doesn't offer a single plan that both Stanford and UCSD's medical centers will accept.

'I am a determined fighter and extremely lucky,' she wrote. 'But this luck may have just run out: My affordable, lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled effective December 31.'

On Tuesday she told MailOnline that thanks to Pfeiffer's tweet, 'I now understand why United Healthcare pulled out of the California market. They had a tax disadvantage.'

Think Progress, the liberal advocacy blog that the White House official promoted, dropped that bombshell in among its defenses of the Affordable Care Act.

'In California, a tax advantage put in $100 million last year went to Blue Shield and Anthem BlueCross,' Sundby said, calling it an instance of 'political cronyism.'

United Healthcare, her insurer, 'had to pull out of this market because they couldn't compete against that $100 million in tax welfare,' she explained. 'The outrage should be against the tax code,' instead of over her Wall Street Journal essay, she said.

'With tax breaks here and there, our government controls winners and losers. Just like with health care.'

'I really, really love living,' Sundby told MailOnline, but she's scared that the health care keeping her alive could be sidelined in the name of cost-cutting

After her first cancer diagnosis, the devout Sundby walked 800 miles, visiting all of California's old Catholic missions. 'Statistically, she should be dead,' read a website set up to track her travels. Pictured with her husband Dale

Sundby also said President Obama and every member of Congress should voluntarily put themselves and all their family members and staffers into the health care exchanges instead of remaining on their government-funded 'Cadillac plans.' 

'There's something we could do right now,' she said, 'and that's for the American people to insist that government officials sign up for their own insurance on the exchanges.'

'That's the right thing to do. They legislated it. The American people have to use it. That's the best way to fix the health care system. Make everyone in charge understand just what a big mess this is.'

'I think the executive branch – president Obama actually – Do you know what would warm our hearts, really? It would be for President Obama to get up and say. "I have just put all my staff, and I just put my family, my precious family, on the health care exchanges. I believe so strongly that it will work and that it's working now, that we're going to get in the boat with you."'

She said Obama should issue an executive order 'requiring that my cabinet and other parts of the federal government's executive branch sign up for our health insurance on the exchanges.'

'Congress should do it on their own too,' she said.

Asked if putting government in charge of health care was a recipe for disaster, Sundby gave an enthusiastic 'Yes!'

'Government is potentially making life-or-death decisions for me? My God – they can't even run the DMV.' 

Sundby is the prototypical ray of sunshine, fighting cancer with a positive attitude and a healthy dose of respect for the disease's power

With Obamacare pushing her insurance company out of the individual market, Sundby says she might not be able to keep visiting her cancer center -- and its caring staff -- who have been keeping her alive

'The path to hell is paved with good intentions,' she insisted. 'They've mucked up Medicare and Social Security by putting all that money in the general fund. Why didn't they put that money aside for us? And why do we trust these people to run something even bigger?'

Sundby told MailOnline that she didn't intend to spark a political firestorm. Her life has been a quiet and pleasure-filled one, from her church worship to her 38-year-strong marriage to former Palo Alto, California IBM chief Dale Sundby.

The pair's twin daughters are in their 20s, and Edie would very much like to stick around to watch them build their own families.

She wrote her op-ed as a response to a Los Angeles Times story that made her reflect on her years fighting cancers – first in her lungs and then in her gallbladder.

She has undergone more than 65 cancer treatments. Her body has been wracked by more than a half-kilogram of chemotherapy drugs.

Two surgeries claimed portions of her liver and her right lung.

She told MailOnline: 'I'm a registered independent. I have voted for as many Democrats over the years as I have Republicans. I did not do this as a political thing.'

'But I'm hearing that millions – millions! – feel like I do, and are having the same kind of frustration.'

White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer (R) is close to Barack Obama, meaning that his tweets provide the impression that he's speaking for the president

She said she reads The New York Times online every day, and The Wall Street Journal in print. The Times ran her essay in July about how she has stayed one step ahead of cancer, but 'it only got 34 comments,' she said.

'So the Journal got this one.'

Long walk: Sundby trekked 793 miles to visit all of California's old Spanish missions, as a show of gratitude for a lengthened life that doctors warned her not to expect

Sundby doesn't watch television at all.

'Wolf Blitzer called and I had no idea who he was,' she said. 'I had to Wiki him. I had to Wiki [Larry] Kudlow, I had to Wiki [Neil] Cavuto.'

Pressed to look over the horizon, Sundby warned that the U.S. is pointed toward reproducing Britain's National Health Service.

'We're headed in that direction, and I don't think it's good,' she told MailOnline.

'The people who come from all over the world and sit with me in the waiting rooms of these cancer centers, they come here because we have the most cutting-edge medical care in the world. And that's so expensive. When we focus too much on cost-cutting, well, there it goes.'

Sundby completed a 793 mile walk through California shortly after her first cancer diagnosis, visiting every one of the old Catholic missions on foot.

She calls her trek along the old El Camino Real mission 
trail from San Diego to Sonoma a 55-day, 14-1/2 mile per day walk 'to 
celebrate life and God's Grace.'

Her life has lasted nearly seven years since a doctor told her, 'You have some things going on in your abdominal area, and it looks like cancer.'

The White House did not respond to a request for a reaction from Pfeiffer.
