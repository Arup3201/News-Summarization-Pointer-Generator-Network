The house where Rudyard Kipling wrote some of his best-loved works including the Just So Stories has gone on sale for £1.6m.

The beautiful five-bedroom home is located in the centre of Rottingdean, near Brighton, East Sussex and still features the study where the author penned some of his works.

Artist Sir
 Philip Burne-Jones 1899 even immortalised the study in one of his 
portraits - which is now housed in the National Portrait Gallery.

For sale: The five-bedroom home in East Sussex that the author used to rent is for sale for £1.6m

Property: The house, located next to the green in Rottingdean, East Sussex, boasts its own library

On the exterior of the house is a blue plaque - installed by the Kipling Society to commemorate the time Kipling spent in the property with his wife Carrie, the daughter of American agent and publisher Wolcott Balestier, and their children.

The stunning house, complete with bay windows and gravel driveway, is on the market for 
£1,595,000.

It features four floors and includes a kitchen, dining room, family 
room, library, hallway, dressing room, five bedrooms and two bathrooms.

The author, whose works 
include The Jungle Book and the Just So Stories, moved into the house, which backs on to the 
village green, just before the turn of the 20th century.

Previously, the family had live in Vermont, America, before returning to Torquay, Devon following a dispute with Kipling's American agent.

Kipling then lived in the Rottingdean house - called The Elms at the time - from 1897 to 1903.

Kipling, his wife and their three 
children Josephine, Elsie and baby John, moved into the property as the 
writer wanted to be closer to his aunt - who lived next door.

The family remained in the home - for which Kipling reportedly paid three guineas a week - for six years.

In one journal, Kipling wrote about the property: 'It was small, none too well built, but cheap.'

While living 
there, he enjoyed one of the most productive periods of his life, 
writing the poem Recessional in 1897 for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.

Controversial poem The White Man's Burden, about the obligation of white people to rule over those from other cultural backgrounds, was written in 1899.

Kim  - a novel about political conflict between Russia and Britain in Central Asia following the second Afghan War - was also written in the house in 1902.

The Just So stories - inspired by the bed-time stories Kipling would tell his eldest daughter Josephine while they lived at the house, was also penned in 1902.

Kipling illustrated the first edition of the stories, also.

It is thought that the name came from 
his daughter's request for her father to repeat his stories for her just
 as he had first told them, or 'Just So'.

Sadly Josephine died of pneumonia, which she contracted on a family trip to visit Carrie's mother in American in 1902.

The family moved to Burwash, East Sussex to a house called Bateman's which dated back to 1634, following her death.

Some day Kipling, who by 1902 was one of the highest paid writers in the world, moved from the house because his neighbours kept looking over the wall that surrounds the property.

Kipling stayed at Bateman's, around 50 miles from the Rottingdean house, until he died in 1936.

The home is described by the estate agent Winkworth, as in: 'A striking 
spot in the centre of Rottingdean.'

The
 agent adds that the former home of the famous author, 'oozes grace, 
poise and commands nothing less than your complete attention.'

They say it is 'a
 perfect fusion of space, light and intrinsic decoration, this charming 
property is woven with the echoes of a globally renowned writer.'

They add: 'A beautiful pond, delightful pub, and charming church are all within immediate reach.'

The stories, first published in 1902, are fantastical accounts of how various phenomena came about. 

Typically, they have the theme of a particular animal being changed from its original form by the acts of man, or some magical 
being.

For example, one explains how a leopard got its spots - from an 
Ethiopian hand-painting them on.

The tale reads: 'Then the Ethiopian put his five fingers close together and pressed them all over the Leopard, and wherever the five fingers touched they left five little black marks, all close together.'

Other tales see the Kangaroo getting
 its powerful hind legs, long tail, and hopping gait after being chased 
all day by a dingo.

A forerunner of the book was Kipling's 'How Fear Came' which was included in The Second Jungle Book (1895). In it, Mowgli hears the story of how the tiger got his stripes.

Kipling illustrated the original editions of the Just So Stories, see above. Other illustrators of the book include Joseph M. Gleeson.

The tales remain popular today and have been even been published as Penguin Classics, above.
