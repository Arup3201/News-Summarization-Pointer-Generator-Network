Rescue workers have recovered the bodies of two young cousins who were buried alive under dirt at a construction site in North Carolina on Sunday afternoon.

Seven-year-old James Levi Caldwell and six-year-old Chloe Jade Arwood became trapped after a dirt wall collapsed on them as they played in a 25ft-deep hole in Stanley.

Chloe's father, Jordan Arwood, had been working on the unfinished home and called 911 for help. As many as 65 rescuers fled to the scene.

Buried: A wall collapsed on the children as they played in an incident witnessed by one of their fathers

Denver Fire Department public 
information officer Dion Burleson told The Associated Press on Sunday 
that the effort had changed from a rescue effort to a 
recovery effort.

Mr Arwood was reportedly in the process of digging out the basement of the unfinished home when the children were caught in the collapse.

WCNC reported that
the children, who are believed to be 
cousins, were in a basement under construction when a wall collapsed on 
them.

The father called 911 at 5.07pm and said he saw the children engulfed by the dirt while playing.

Neighbours told theÂ Charlotte Observer that Arwood lives on the land with his parents and several children.

Rescuers from several nearby areas were on scene within minutes, but could not reach the children.

The stations said firefighters
were using shovels and climbing gear to try to get the children out.

Their bodies were recovered around 8am on Saturday.

Frantic search: More than 60 rescue personnel raced to the scene and searched all night for the cousins

Horror: The hole at the construction site was believed to be about 20 to 25 feet deep

'There are calls at times like this happen where we are not able to make a difference because it's outside of our realm,' said Burleson, choking up slightly.

'This is one of those cases, and it's devastating to not only to the family, but each and every one of the responders that is out here.'

One neighbour, 
Sybil Johnson, told WCNC that she tried to comfort one of the 
victim's younger siblings before the bodies were found.

'They kept saying,
"They have been down there too long without air",' Johnson said. 'That 
is what the little kids were saying up here. I told them, "God will take
care of them".'
