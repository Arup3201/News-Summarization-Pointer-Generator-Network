A ride operator facing criminal charges over injuries at the North Carolina State Fair has made his first court appearance.

Timothy Dwayne Tutterrow of Quitman, Georgia, faces three counts of assault with a deadly weapon, inflicting serious injury.  

Wake County District Court Judge Keith Gregory declined to lower Tutterrow's $225,000 bond. The 46-year-old defendant was returned to jail in handcuffs.

The Vortex jolted into motion on Thursday evening as people were exiting, dropping riders from heights of up to 30 feet.

Wake Sheriff Donnie Harrison says the ride had been intentionally tampered with to bypass critical safety devices.   

Three people remained hospitalized on Monday, including a 14-year-old child.   

Records show Tutterrow has twice been arrested for drug charges, including a 2002 felony charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.

Three people remain in hospital with one critically injured today after a malfunctioning ride at a state fair sent them plummeting to the ground.

Anthony Gorham, 29, Kisha Gorham, 39, and a 14-year-old whose name was not released were still in hospital today. The severity of their injuries is unknown.

Horrified bystanders watched as riders were thrown off while others tried to hold on to the machine.

Max Byrn, 13, told ABC News Radio that he was watching the ride and had seen people knocked unconscious.

He said:
'There were actually some people that were still, I think, strapped in 
and holding on, really hanging on for their lives.  But they were 
falling like raindrops. It was really crazy.'

The Vortex is a pendulum ride that flips passengers upside down.

Five victims, aged 14 to 39, were initially taken to hospital but two were released. It appears that several victims belong to the same family.

Witnesses say the ride had stopped and people 
were getting off when it started moving again.

Wake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison told ABC11: 'After inspection of the ride, we determined that it had been tampered with and critical safety devices were compromised.'

Tutterrow's lawyer refused to comment on the charges but said that his client is a father and grandfather and that his prayers were with those who had been injured.
