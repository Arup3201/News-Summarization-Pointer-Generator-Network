PCSO Oguz Batmaz was sentenced to seven years after he tipped off his drug dealer friends

A PCSO who tipped off his drug dealing pals where cannabis factories were so they could steal the crop was today jailed for seven years.

Cocaine dealing Oguz Batmaz, 27, known as Oz, passed on information he got from searching Scotland Yard databases so his gang had a plentiful supply of drugs.

He also updated them on what the cops knew about the gang so they could avoid getting caught and he even helped a convict who escaped from prison stay on the run.

Batmaz, who had worked for the Met since 2007, was topping up his £15,000 a year salary with an extra £1,000 a week dealing cocaine and cannabis on the side.

He was sacked from the force after pleading guilty to drug dealing, conspiracy to steal and abusing his position last year.

Sentencing him at Southwark Crown Court, Judge Andrew Goymer said: 'Oguz Batmaz you were a PCSO and by your own admission and your guilty pleas you misused and abused your of position of trust by accessing information on the computer when you had no good reason to.

'That, however, was not the end of it. You did not simply give family and friends information they were not entitled to, there was a continued and sustained misuse of information on that computer. It went beyond that.

'Your relationship with criminals can only be described as improper and corrupt.

'You gave them information on what the police knew about them and what addresses they had under suspicion.

'And you told them addresses where cannabis factories could be found so they could then steal them knowing the owners of such properties would not report the theft of illegal drugs.

'Your sideline to your legal employment was dealing in class A and class B drugs.

'It makes little difference, if any, that you were not a fully warranted police officer.

'The public are entitled to expect 
the highest standards of service from a police officer. Anybody who 
breaks this high standard will be properly punished.'

Dressed in a smart grey suit, Batmaz 
shouted: 'Stay stong, try and appeal it. It’s ridiculous' to his 
distraught family as he was led down to the cells.

Earlier his barrister James Hines 
told the court he came from a ‘respectable and law-abiding Turkish 
family’ and had good intentions when he joined the Met in 2003.

But he claimed the Mottingham and 
Chislehurst Safer Neighbourhood Team Office where Batmaz worked 
encouraged idleness and was rife with gambling. He was also bullied for 
being dyslexic.

The court heard sergeants and senior officers at the Mottingham and Chiselhurst Safer Neighbourhood Team were dismissed after the investigation into Batmaz exposed their incredible gambling habits.

‘Much has been written about what went on in the pre-fabricated office where the team was based,’ said James Hines, defending Batmaz.

‘The ethos he ran into there did little to encourage his ambitions, or meet his hopes for the police force.

Bags packed: PCSO Oguz Batmaz, (left) at Southwark Crown Court, passed on information from searching the police database to a criminal gang, while Kadr Ozresberoglu (right) was also sentenced to 40 months

In court: Batmaz conducted searches on names and addresses linked to the boyfriend of Emma Tooke (left), who was a crack cocaine dealer. His friend Kadir Ozresberoglu (right), a drug dealer, was caught on tape with the PCSO

Part of the gang: Lee Hession (left) and Anthony Noble (right) was sentenced alongside Batmaz at Southwark Crown Court

‘Revelations that included sergeants 
and senior officers there were engaging in backgammon, gambling on 
backgammon, playing cards and spending very little time engaging in 
police work.

‘Many of them have now been disciplined as a result of this particular surveillance.

‘The extent to which gambling went on
there was quite frankly shocking, with young officers becoming in debt 
to senior officers.’

When he first illegally accessed 
computers in the summer of 2007 Mr Hines said it was a ‘misguided 
attempt to impress others and make him seem more important and 
interesting than perhaps he was.’

Batmaz was later paid for information
by various criminal pals and even tipped them off with intelligence on 
where ‘Gundawoody’ or cannabis factories were.

In bugged recordings which trapped 
him Batmaz is heard boasting he was doing other dealers a favour by 
moving the drugs before police busted them.

'See the way I look at it I’m doing 
these boys a favour....coming up on the system they’re obviously gonna 
get raided at one point so I am just raiding them before they get 
raided,' he said.

Lee Hession (left) recieved 27 months and Kadir Ozresberoglu (right) was given 40 months in jail

The judge said that he had no choice but to give Anthony Noble (left) 18 months, while Aaron Eastwood (right) recieved 18 months

Referred to as their ‘copper friend,’
BMW-driving Batmaz even helped convict Wayne Farrell, who was serving a
six-year stretch for conspiracy to supply crack cocaine, stay on the 
run after he escaped from prison.

The court heard Batmaz conducted a 
number of searches on names and addresses linked to Farrell while he 
stayed with girlfriend Emma Tooke to avoid the pair getting caught.

But by April 2010 the police were 
aware of the PCSO’s activities and placed an entry about Farrell on the 
database to see how Batmaz reacted. Three minutes later records show he 
phoned Farrell to pass on the information.

Two months before the gang were 
arrested Batmaz is heard joking his flat might be bugged but said: 'If 
there’s recorders in here we’d be f***ed a long time ago.'

His drug dealer pal Kadir 
Ozresberoglu then continues the joke saying: 'Yeah, they’re building one
up on us, building big one up on us.'

The pair were arrested at Batmaz’s flat in New Eltham, south east London, in June 2010.

As they were raided Ozresberoglu 
tried to throw cocaine out of the bedroom window while Batmaz appeared 
to be in distress and was asking for water.

Prosecutor David Durose said: 'The crown suggests that he had swallowed the packets of drugs that were already made up.'

Drugs paraphernalia including scales, cannabis grinders and mixing agents were also found in the property.

Eight of his gang were also sentenced for similar offences today.

Filipe De Frietas, 26, was jailed for
two years, Ozresberoglu,26, for 40 months, Lee Hession, 30, for 27 
months while dad-of-five Aaron Eastwood, 32, was locked up for 18 
months.

Batmaz’s cousin Ayhan Mustafa, 30, who played a minor role, was sentenced to 14 months behind bars.

Southwark Crown Court heard that Batmaz had abused his position

Escaped convict Wayne Farrell, 35, 
was jailed for three years and his girlfriend Emma Tooke, 33, who 
admitted harbouring a criminal was sentenced to six months.

The court heard Farrell has since abandoned her despite her going on the run with him for nine months.

An eighth defendant Anthony Noble, 
30, who was once an International dance champion, got involved with the 
gang after being unable to pay his cocaine debts.

The judge said although he had tried to turn his life around he had no choice but to jail him for 18 months.

The Chistlehurst office where Batmaz 
worked has now closed following an anti-corruption investigation and 
many of his colleagues have been disciplined or sacked, the court heard.
