Following the release of Apple’s latest handsets, a wave of people flocked to sell their old models in order to get their hands on the new ones, on sites such as eBay and Craigslist.

But buying second-hand devices in this way can be risky, especially if you’re unsure if the handset on offer has been stolen or not.

Apple has released a tool that now lets potential buyers check to see if the Activation Lock on the handset is switched on, and whether the device needs a password to use.

Apple's online tool (pictured) lets buyers check the status of a second-hand device. If Activation Lock is enabled, it means the handset is locked and needs a password to access. This suggests the owner of the phone has not removed these security steps, which in turn suggests the seller may not be the legal owner

If an Activation Lock is enabled, it suggests the owner of the phone has not removed the security steps needed to access the device.

It would, therefore, be unusual for a person selling the handset to leave it locked and protected – meaning there is a chance it is stolen, or doesn’t belong to the person selling it.

Activation Lock was added to Apple's Find My iPhone feature in iOS 7. 

It is designed to prevent anyone else, other than the owner, from using an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch if it is lost or stolen. 

The feature is automatically enabled when Find My iPhone is switched on. 

To access a phone with Activation Lock enabled, users will need a password and the connected Apple ID.  

To enable Find My iPhone, go to Settings, iCloud, sign in with an Apple ID and select Turn on Find My iPhone. 

If the Activation Lock is switched off, buyers can assume that the device is being sold legally.

Or, at the very least, it has been wiped and the previous owner's details removed.  

To check a phone’s status, buyers enter the IMEI or serial number of the handset into the online tool.

These numbers are listed in the phone’s Settings menu, by clicking General and About.

If the phone is being sold online, and the buyer can’t see it before purchasing it, they should ask the seller for the number.

Alternatively, the seller can perform the check and provide proof about the phone’s status, before agreeing a sale.

There have been reports recently of hackers being able to bypass the activation lock, to make the phone appear to be unlocked.

But Apple’s tool will reveal if the lock is still enabled.

Apple advises users: ‘If you received this device from someone else, contact the previous owner and ask them to erase the device and remove it from their account.

‘If you’re going to sell or give away a device, always sign out of iCloud and erase all content and settings before giving the device to someone else.

'Go to Settings, General, Reset and Erase All Content.'

Apple also has support pages that explain how to remove a device from a previous owner’s account, and steps to take before selling a second-hand iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
