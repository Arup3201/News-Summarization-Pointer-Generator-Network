Bad teacher: RE teacher Catherine Reynolds told students to 'p*** off'

As an RE teacher it was her job to enlighten pupils about Christian values and the beliefs of other religions.

Instead, Catherine Reynolds encouraged her class to have lots of sex and ‘sleep around’ before marriage.

In expletive-ridden lessons, she told 
pupils to ‘stop bloody talking’, ‘sit on your a***’ and warned them: ‘If
you don’t want to learn RE, you can p*** off’.

An investigation into her behaviour 
also found she posted offensive comments on her Facebook page. Following
a parents evening she wrote: ‘That was the most f****** horrendous 
evening of my life’, and branded parents ‘retarded’.

Yesterday Reynolds, 27, was banned 
from the classroom for five years after Michael Gove decided she was a 
disgrace to the profession.

Describing her conduct as 
unacceptable, the Education Secretary declared it fell seriously short 
of that expected of a teacher and added that a disciplinary panel had 
struggled to identify any ‘understanding, insight or remorse’.

Reynolds taught RE at Saddleworth 
School near Oldham, having joined the state-run secondary as a 
newly-qualified teacher in 2008.

The Manchester University graduate 
initially showed promise, and was feted by pupils on a ‘rate my teacher’
website.

However, she got into trouble after her Facebook comments of 
September 2010 came to light, a report by a Teachers Agency panel found.

These included: ‘F****** retarded parents’ followed by: ‘That’s because only eejits pick RE’.

Further complaints followed in January and March 2011, the panel said.

Reynolds made numerous references to 
‘sex from a personal perspective’ and told one pupil ‘not to get married
because then you can’t sleep around’ and that ‘you should have sex all 
the time’.

In one lesson, she recounted a visit 
to Amsterdam in which she saw a sex show involving a horse and a woman 
and revealed she had been for a naked massage.

She used inappropriate 
language on a regular basis, the report found, including a string of 
swear words used to describe various people. One pupil was apparently 
told to ‘F*** off’.

Reynolds, who is married with a 
one-year-old daughter, told her class of taking a morning-after pill and
of having a relationship with an older man.

She also showed pupils the tattoos on her lower back and her thigh and played them ‘inappropriate videos’.

Inappropriate: Catherine Reynolds told her RE students at Saddleworth School in Oldham to sleep around and not get married

One pupil claimed Reynolds did so when
she ‘couldn’t be bothered teaching’ and others said she was hindering 
their progress. One said: ‘I don’t feel I am taught anything.’

Reynolds was suspended by her headteacher in March 2011 and resigned four months later.

Recommending a ban, the panel said she
had ‘singularly failed to act as a role model to her pupils’ and had a 
‘deep-seated attitude that can lead to harmful behaviour’.

Mr Gove said the five-year ban would give her the ‘opportunity to consider whether she wishes to teach again’.

Reynolds could not be contacted last 
night but her mother, Debbie, said at her home in Tyldesey, Greater 
Manchester: ‘Catherine is no longer a teacher. She has to earn a living 
as she has a little girl to care for now.

‘She will be devastated by this report
which is very one-sided. There is no mention of what led up to these 
allegations and I think this has been a witch-hunt. I don’t know if she 
will want me to say any more.’
