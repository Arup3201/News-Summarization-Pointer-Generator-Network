One angry passenger managed to delay flights out of a Nigerian airport after stepping out on the runway in front of a plane. 

After finding out his flight from Abuja's Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport was cancelled, the flustered passenger decided to take his frustrations out by taking his luggage and entering the runway.

Passengers on board an Arik flight to Lagos were forced to disembark after the man refused to move, with one eyewitness saying security failed to show up and it took the pilot to plead with the man before the plane could take off.

The man was angry that his flight to Sokoto was cancelled, and so entered the runway

At least two flights out of the Nigerian airport, one to Calabar and one to Lagos, were delayed by two hours by the man's actions.

Passenger Cedar Chinwuba, who was on the flight to Lagos, posted a series of photos on Twitter as the scene played out.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Chinwuba said: 'It was very terrible. What came to my mind was that Nigeria Airport Authority needs to step up. 

'For two hours, no security agent showed up. It got to the point the pilot announced that he had placed a call to Arik airline to send the Nigeria police but had no response. 

The man's actions caused panic among passengers on a flight bound for Lagos, who were forced to disembark onto the tarmac

Twitter user Cedar Chinwuba reported live from the scene as he was a passenger on the plane that was blocked from take-off by an irate man on the runway

'An announcement was made by the pilot that we couldn't take off due to some disgruntled passengers blocking the plane and he has tried to reach the airport security but no response. 

'After a few minutes, he requested that due to security reasons those who wish to disembark from the trip should do so. 

'Only in Nigeria issues like this happen and they never get penalised.

One eyewitness said security failed to arrive for more than two hours after the pilot had radioed through

'One of the angry passenger I had a chat with stated that all they wanted was a senior officer of Arik coming to the tarmac to address the issue. 

'It worries me as an airport user.' 

He explained that along with all the other passengers on the Lagos flight were told to get off the plane and that 'no Arik flight was leaving Abuja.'

MailOnline Travel have contacted Arik Air, and are awaiting comment. The flight is believed to have taken off at 5.15pm local time, two hours behind schedule.
