A polish captain ran his massive ship aground off the British coast after plotting a straight line from Scotland to Belgium - forgetting that England was in the way, it is claimed.

Blundering Tadeusz Dudek had been using an unapproved GPS device to navigate - similar to a car's Sat Nav, an investigation revealed.

And the lookout on board the 80 metre-long MV Danio cargo ship was asleep when time the enormous vessel crashed into Farne Islands, off the North-East coast, last March.

The disaster at the Farne Island nature 
reserve, in Northumberland, sparked fears at the time it would break up 
and its 27 tonnes of diesel fuel and 1,500 tonnes of timber would 
decimate the wildlife for decades.

Coastguard
 surveyor Alan Thompson told a BBC Inside Out documentary: 'They basically said "well OK 
we're sailing from Perth and we're going to Antwerp and we'll draw a 
line and we'll go the quickest way possible", without really thinking.'

Following the accident coastguard surveyor, Alan Thompson, detained the vessel at Blyth port.

He said from the evidence they looked at there was a serious failing of the ship's safety management system.

He says: 'He was using an unapproved electronic chart plotter, which is basically a bit like your GPS for the car.'

Mr Thompson says from the time the Danio left Perth to the time it went to ground, there were two positions on the chart.

He said: 'They basically said 'well OK we're sailing from Perth and we're
 going to Antwerp and we'll draw a line and we'll go the quickest way 
possible,' without really thinking.'

Usually a bridge look-out should still have spotted the Farne Islands and its flashing lighthouse.

Mr Thompson added: 'If he's fallen asleep it will alarm in the 
captain's cabin and if the captain doesn't acknowledge it, it will ring 
everywhere.

'Now the Danio did have a very basic bridge watch alarm, but it was switched off.'

But
 the German owner of the Danio, Frank Dahl, tells the BBC in Poland - 
where the vessel is being repaired - stresses it was his company policy 
to use it and he blames the Captain and the First Mate for the accident.

He tells the programme: 'The technique is perfect, it's the humans that make mistakes'.

He subsequently fired Captain Tadeusz Dudek, and the first mate.

Captain
 Dudek via telephone then tells the BBC in broken English about whether 
the first mate did fall asleep and Captain Dudek replies: 'It is what he
 told in his statement and it looks like it is true.'

And
 he admits that if he had used the alarm system the accident could have 
been prevented, adding: 'Yes but I forgot. For sure this would not 
happen (if the alarm had been used).'

Eventually the ship was floated away 
but new research shows the captain was trying to sail a straight line 
from Scotland to Anterp, in Belgium - and forgot about England's 
jutting-out coastline in the middle.

Built in 2001, the ship was sailing six months ago with a cargo of timber but just six crew.

When
 it ran aground, a lifeboat was scrambled to the scene from Seahouses 
and as the weather worsened and the drama unfolded, wildlife wardens on 
the Farnes feared an environmental disaster.

The islands are home to about 80,000 pairs of seabirds and a large grey seal colony.

National
 Trust Ranger, David Steel, says: 'To have a boat like that run aground 
and obviously if it had started breaking up with fuel oil and the likes 
spilling into the sea, it would have been devastating.'

Inside
 Out also reveals that 95 per cent of Britain's freight is shifted by 
sea and last year a third of all ships detained for serious breaches 
were found in the North East.

However British authorities have still to decide whether to bring criminal charges in the case of the Danio.

The programme will be broadcast tonight on BBC ONE (North East & Cumbria) at 7.30pm.
