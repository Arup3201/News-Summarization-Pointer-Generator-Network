Jack Wilshere has returned to training after recovering from an ankle injury picked up during Arsenal's 2-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday.

The England international underwent medical tests on Wednesday, and was seen kicking balls and moving freely during a training session at London Colney ahead of the Gunners showdown with Aston Villa on Saturday.

The news will come as a relief to Wilshere and manager Arsene Wenger given the England star's chequered injury history.

Speaking after the loss in Dortmund, the Gunners midfielder insisted he was 'fine', and the medical examinations have supported Wilshere's immediate assertions.

Wilshere received lengthy treatment on the pitch in the closing minutes of the  defeat in Germany but hobbled through to the end because Arsenal had already used their three substitutes.

The 22-year-old looked determined prior to the tests on Thursday, as he shared a picture of himself on Instagram with the crocked Olivier Giroud, and goalkepeer Wojciech Szczesny.
