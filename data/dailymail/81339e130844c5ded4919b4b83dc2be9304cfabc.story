Body found: Police found an SUV belonging to Raquel Calderin, 42, who hasn't been seen since September 2012. Human remains were discovered inside the car

A car belonging to a Florida woman missing since September 2012 has been found, and police discovered human remains inside. 

Police found the blue Ford Expedition belonging to Raquel Calderin, 42, submerged in a canal north of the Tamiami Trail.

Calderin's estranged husband, Jesus Maqueira, 56, was charged with her murder in February 2013 after allegedly admitting to the murder but taunting police, saying they had no proof without a body.

The Miami-Dade Medical Examiner's Office is now working to identify the human remains.

Raquel Calderin and Jesus Maqueira had been married for 20 years and had three children when she filed for divorce in September of 2012.

Calderin was a school custodian who had left her husband in July 2012 and filed for divorce and a restraining order.

According to the Miami Herald, friends of Calderin say Maqueira was a jealous and domineering husband who frequently physically and emotionally abused his wife.

In 1996 and again in 2009 Calderin sought a restraining order against her husband for domestic violence.

She repeatedly left the home for days at a time, staying in women's shelters.

Finally, after meeting another man, Dagoberto Vasquez, in a supermarket Calderin left her husband good.

The Miami Herald reports that Maqueira then began stalking his wife, bombarding her with phone calls and text messages such as 'die whore.'

He would park his car across the street from Gloria Floyd Elementary where she worked as a custodian and stay for hours.

Charged: Jesus Maqueira was arrested in February 2013 for the killing of his wife, with whom he had three children

New development: Krome Avenue north of Tamiami Trail, near where Calderin's SUV was discovered submerged in a canal

On the final day Calderin was seen, Maqueira confronted her at the school with the couple's 15-year-old daughter in tow and tried to convince her to return home.

She refused and after Maqueira had left, her supervisor allowed the shaken and emotional Calderin to leave early, around 9:30pm.

Calderin phoned Vasquez, with whom she was living, as she left the school. But at 9:38pm, the call dropped out.

Calderin was never seen again.

After months of searching for Calderin, Maqueira was brought into the Miami-Dade Police Department for questioning.

His alibi for the night Calderin had disappeared had fallen through, and his cell phone records placed him near the elementary school that night.

Denial: Despite allegedly confessing to police, Maqueira has since denied having anything to do with his wife's disappearance

Miami-Dade Detective Juan Segovia told the Miami Herald that Maqueira at one point told police sarcastically, 'Look, I killed her, take me to jail,' and made light of the fact that there was no physical evidence.

'Mr Maqueira laughed out loud at these investigators and stated that without a body there was very little we could do to him,’ Segovia wrote in a report of the interrogation.

According to the Miami Herald, Maqueira had made cryptic comments to friends and family that whoever had killed Calderin 'would never be found because she was probably dead in a canal.'

Maqueira was arrested for murder and aggravated stalking in February 2013.

An inmate who had befriended Maqueira at the Metro West Detention Center who is now a witness against him told detectives that Maqueira confessed to the murder, saying he hid in the back of Calderin's SUV and beat her to death before driving the car into the canal, reports the Miami Herald.

He is scheduled to go on trial for Calderin's murder next month.
