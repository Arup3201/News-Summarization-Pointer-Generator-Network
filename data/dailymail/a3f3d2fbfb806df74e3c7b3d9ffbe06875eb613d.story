After facing a carpeting from the Palace for cavorting naked with a mystery woman in a Las Vegas hotel room, Prince Harry's burgeoning reputation as a mature young statesman looked to be on the line.

But it appears many think that rather than be ridiculed for his drunken game of 'strip billiards' this week in Sin City, he should instead be congratulated for being being the model British playboy.

Revealing images showing the third in line to the throne standing in a VIP hotel suite in only a necklace with a mystery nude brunette hiding behind him were seen by millions across the world online.

It was assumed that he would be lambasted for bringing the royal family into global disrepute but, in fact, Twitter is awash with thousands of comments from admiring celebrities and fans saying he was a 'good lad' acting 'exactly as a Prince should do'.

Even Sir Richard Barnson said: 'Shock horror, single man naked in own hotel room with woman. What on earth has this got to do with anybody else? Leave Prince Harry alone.'

Leave him alone: Sir Richard Branson was one of many who leapt to the defence of the third in line to the throne

Support: Piers Morgan was one of many celebrities to back the prince publicly as public opinion appeared to swing in Harry's favour

Rock royalty: Kurt Cobain's former wife and musician, Courtney Love, also backed his behaviour as becoming of a prince

But the prince hasn't avoided criticism completely. Some of Fleet Street's most high profile columnists have attacked his naked antics, with some saying he is a 'disgrace' who should be stripped of his royal title and privileges.

Last night the Palace banned the British press from using the pictures, which are freely available online.

Should British newspapers and websites publish the nude pictures of Prince Harry in Las Vegas?

The Times used its main leader column to warn Harry of the consequences of his mistakes in a Nevada hotel this week, especially after he had represented Britain and the royal family so well at the Olympics.

'Prince Harry is the occupant of a 
special place in the nation's heart. Like a Royal Boris Johnson the 
prince has earned a rare licence to be seen having fun,' it said, adding: 'But he must tread carefully and in future, more carefully than this.

'His reinvention has been a
joy to behold, with a new maturity becoming evident alongside his easy 
manner and charm. As a single young man, blessed with money and looks, 
he is perfectly free to set his sights on being the nation's favourite 
playboy. But it would be a shame.'

Letting his heir down: Prince Harry relaxed poolside surrounded by bikini-clad girls in Vegas and even played naked billiards put the public appear to want to back him for it

Party-boy: 'Prince Harry, far right in a hat, went to Vegas to relax after the Olympics but it gout of hand

A quick search on the the internet allows people to see the pictures that are 'banned' in the UK

An identical search on Google images for 'Prince Harry naked pictures' reveals dozens more shots of the cavorting Prince

The Daily Telegraph's Peter Oborne said Harry had ignored his responsibilities to the Queen and the Armed Forces.

'What was Prince Harry thinking of? He’s not a gormless 19-year-old boy any more. He’s a grown-up man, a 27-year-old Army officer who also happens to be third in line to the throne,' he wrote.

'He belongs to an institution that stands for certain forms of behaviour, and cannot survive if its members flout them.

Opinion: The British press was barred from using the pictures, despite them being freely available online, The Times said in its leader column, adding , in essence, that Harry is likeable but has to grow up

'Indeed, the Prince belongs to two such institutions: he is an officer in the British Army, and as such is expected to observe its own code of ethics. That this, too, was broken during this trip to Las Vegas is no coincidence. The Army is another institution that requires discipline, restraint, forbearance and sacrifice.'

The Mail's Amanda Platell said: 'How unfortunate that when things 
were going so well for him, Harry gets caught with his pants down – 
literally – and pictures of him partying naked are beamed across the 
world.

'Who on earth advised the third in line to the throne to indulge 
in some "full-on partying" in the world’s self-styled capital of sleaze,
Las Vegas?

Trashing: The Daily Telegraph's esteemed commentator Peter Oborne laid into Harry and his antics in this morning's paper

Critical: Oborne questioned Harry's maturity and ability to make the right decisions

'Downing vodka shots and cavorting 
until the early hours of the morning with bikini-clad wannabes, this was
more the world of soft-porn films than the behaviour expected of the 
Queen’s grandson.

Opinion: The Mail's Amanda Platell said she had sympathy for Harry for what he has experienced in life, but believed his Vegas strip billiards showed huge error of judgment

'We had come to think that poor judgment and immaturity
were all in the past for Harry. For, at the age of 27, he is now a man 
with the responsibilities of an Army officer.

'So, yes, we have made allowances for 
Harry, but he will be 28 next month and it’s time he grew up.'

The Guardian was even stronger in its criticism, saying that the prince should be stripped of his title.

'What shall we do with Prince Harry? It hasn't even been two weeks since he represented the Queen at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics, and there he is in VEGAS, NAKED, playing STRIP BILLIARDS,' said writer Emma Keller.

'I have an idea for him and for other members of the royal family who gad about and undermine the hard work of the rest of their team (Prince Andrew, anyone?)

'Let's strip them of their royal status. He could get as drunk as he likes and strip of all over the place – just like any old toff.

'He'd
still have a job. He has a real job in the army already that has 
nothing to do with being royal.

'He's a captain in the Blues and Royals and has served in Afghanistan – at his own behest. But if you remember, he had to be pulled out because of publicity over his royal status. So being royal is nothing but a pain for him.'

But despite the criticism, the online world seems to be backing the prince, especially celebrities.

Amanda Platell said that Harry's behaviour had got out of control on his American jaunt

British DJ Christian O'Connell said: 'Prince Harry is doing EXACTLY as a prince should do. Party in Vegas. Good luck to him.'

Fellow
DJ Lauren Laverne added: Prince Harry is EASILY the best royal,' while 
80s pop star Marc Almond said: 'I love Prince Harry getting his kit off 
and having fun before duty in Afg(hanistan). HELL YEAH GO HARRY!'

Boy George tweeted: 'Prince Harry, where was his security? People are so cheap, such 
rubbish photos! The Queen should behead TMZ and send the bitches to da 
Tower.'

Star backing: Boy George said that security and 'cheap' partygoers were to blame for the incident, not Harry, above and below

DJ backing: Cristian O'Connell believes that Harry's exploits should be celebrated

Pop star: Marc Almond said that Harry needed to let his hair down before returning to work as a Captain in the army

He's the best: Lauren Laverne really enjoyed what Harry had been up to

"I'm shocked and disgusted by the Prince Harry party photos in Vegas. Why the hell wasn't I invited???' Piers Morgan said, to which Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria replied: 'Piers this tweet made me laugh out loud!'

Courtney Love Cobain Twitter said 'wow you gotla [sic] love Prince Harry for showing off the 
royal jewels.... oh let him have fun, xc'

And the public also sung his praises: @Leti_Rodriguez said: 'Whatever happened to "What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas"? #PrinceHarry #PoorGuy'

Envious: Popstar and presenter Jenny Frost says that people have a motive for castigating the prince and his behaviour

Sporting chance: Midfield star for champions Manchester City, Nigel de Jong, called Harry a 'ledge', short for legend

@gaylefortes_ added: 'What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Unless you're Prince Harry.. LMAO poor thing'

@xBrittanyMoisax tweeted: 'Who cares what Prince Harry did in Vegas?! He has to act like a prude 24/7, do you blame him for trying to live a little?!'
