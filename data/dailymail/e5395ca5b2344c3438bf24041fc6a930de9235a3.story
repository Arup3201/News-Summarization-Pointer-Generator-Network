 

Kurt Busch has a reason not to believe his ex-girlfriend's claim she was assaulted his ex-girlfriend: she is a trained government assassin  who once came home in an evening gown covered in blood.

The 36-year-old driver also known as The Outlaw appeared in court Tuesday to respond to his ex Patricia Driscoll's request for a no-contact order, weaving stories of international intrigue.

Busch and his legal team painted Driscoll as both a jilted ex and a cold-blooded assassin who once claimed a female CIA operative from the film 'Zero Dark Thirty,' about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, was partly based on her.

Defense: NASCAR driver Kurt Busch went to court over an ex-girlfriend's request for a no-contact order and described her as a deadly contract killer and government assassin

The NASCAR star said Driscoll spoke about her assassin status repeatedly, claiming to have undertaken missions across Central and South America and Africa.

Busch detailed a story from a time when the couple was in El Paso, Texas, where Driscoll left in camouflage gear but later returned in a trench coat covering an evening gown soaked with blood.

Earlier in the hearing, Busch had said his ex told him she was a mercenary who killed for money, and showed off pictures of bodies with gunshot wounds.

Michael Doncheff, who was once a personal assistant to the couple, also said Driscoll claimed she was a trained killer for the US government, saying she once told him, 'I take down foreign governments. I own Washington.'

He also said Driscoll told him in September  she had been body slammed by a big man while helping round up immigrants at the Mexican border, but said he considered the story 'far-fetched.'

'Everybody on the outside can tell me I'm crazy, but I lived on the inside and saw it firsthand,' Busch said when his attorney, Rusty Hardin, questioned why he still believed Driscoll is a hired killer.

Split: Busch testified Monday that he decided to end his relationship with Driscoll after a race last fall because she was monopolizing his schedule and he needed to focus on racing

Though neither Driscoll nor her attorney refuted Busch's recounting of events during the four-day hearing, Driscoll called the claimed 'ludicrous' during an interview with the Associated Press Tuesday night.

She also suggested Busch pulled them from a script she was writing that Busch had proofread.

'These statements made about being a trained assassin, hired killer, are ludicrous and without basis and are an attempt to destroy my credibility,' said Driscoll, works for military contractor Frontline Defense Systems. 

'Not even Rusty Hardin believes this.'

'I find it interesting that some of the outlandish claims come straight from a fictional movie script I've been working on for eight years,' Driscoll added.

Busch testified Monday that he decided to end his relationship with Driscoll after a race last fall because she was monopolizing his schedule and he needed to focus on racing.

Driscoll said Busch assaulted her in his motorhome at Dover International Speedway a week later, grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times. 

Busch and his attorneys have denied the allegations, which are the subject of a separate criminal investigation. 

Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice, cross-examined Busch on Tuesday, but few of her questions dealt directly with the assault allegations.

Busch has testified that he repeatedly told Driscoll to leave after she showed up unannounced at his motorhome, finally cupping her cheeks in his hands, looking her in the eye and telling her she had to go.

'He advised that her head tapped the wall as he was doing that,' Detective James Wood testified Tuesday, recounting Busch's interview with Dover police in November.

Richard Andrew Sniffen, a Christian music minister who performs at NASCAR outreach events and befriended Busch and Driscoll, said Driscoll told him on the night of the alleged assault only that Busch had pushed her and that she hit her head. 

Sniffen said Driscoll was upset, angry and brokenhearted, but that she never said she was afraid of Busch and seemed intent on reconciling.

That attitude shifted in the weeks that followed, Sniffen said, with Driscoll going 'from a broken heart looking for love and reconciliation to anger and a little bit of revenge.'

'I will destroy him,' Sniffen said Driscoll told him, adding that she repeatedly said she would take Busch down.

A court ruling on Driscoll's request for a no-contact order is expected later this month or in early February.
