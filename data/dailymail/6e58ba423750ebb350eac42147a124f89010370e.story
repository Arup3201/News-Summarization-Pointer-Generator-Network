Two Pennsylvania school administrators repeatedly referred to black students and teachers by the N-word in text messages they exchanged on cell phones issued by the school district, it has been revealed.

Coatesville Area School District Superintendent Richard Como and Director of Athletics and Activities Jim Donato, who are both white, are now the subject of a criminal investigation over their use of the racial epithets in text message conversations with each other.

Both administrators resigned from their positions at the end of August, though the Chester County Daily Local reports that they were only forced out after the transcripts of the text messages were leaked to the district attorney, who launched a criminal investigation.

The newspaper reports that the school board was prepared to let both men stay in their jobs, even after an IT technician found the text messages and reported them to school officials.

According to a transcript obtained by the Daily Local, the racist exchanges began in June.

In one, Donato sent a message to Como that appears to say all black students should have the same last name.

He wrote: 'All should just have whatever first names they want...then last name is N*****!

'Leroy N*****, Preacher N*****, Night train n*****, clarence n*****, Latoya n*****, Thelma n***** and so on.'

The superintendent, who has led the district since 2005 and drew a salary of nearly $200,000 last year, responded: 'Great idea! Joe n***** bill n***** snake n***** got a nice ring to it.'

He added: 'Could have whole homerooms of n*****!'

The Donato, the athletics director, replied: 'Hahahahaha! Will N***** report to the office, pardon the interruption but will n***** report to nurses office. N***** to lunch now!'

Later, when the superintendent Como was talking about 23 teachers he had to lay off, Donato asked: 'How many n****** out of 23? Not enough!‚Äù

Como replied: 'Don't know but think it's only 4-5. At most until last minute rush of firing by Goo of Phoenix and Kamara.'

'Good hangings there,' Donato responded.
