Jailed teacher Jeremy Forrest is to be moved to a sex offenders’ prison nearly 200 miles away from his former school after the pupil he ran away with tried to contact him and obtain visitor rights, it has emerged.

Forrest is currently serving a five-and-a-half-year sentence at the mainstream Lewes prison, East Sussex, only a few miles from Bishop Bell School, Eastbourne, where he started the affair with the 15-year-old.

Built to cope with the dramatic increase in the number of people being convicted of sexual abuse, they have faced a barrage of criticism, with many people fearing that keeping abusers together could reinforce their behaviour.

Last night a Prison Service spokesman refused to comment on the transfer.
