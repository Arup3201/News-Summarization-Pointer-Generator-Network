Failure: George Entwistle has admitted that it will take time to earn the audience's trust again

BBC director general George Entwistle has admitted the BBC has failed to get things right since the Savile crisis began.

The executive confessed he realised it would take time to “regain the trust of the audience”.

A recent poll by the corporation found public trust in it had plunged because of the revelations about Savile and its subsequent handling of them.

In 2009, 62 per cent of licence fee payers said the BBC was ‘trustworthy’ but this figure has now plunged to 47 per cent.

Speaking at an international conference for public broadcasters he admitted that he was 'determined' to restore the sense of pride in the BBC that viewers had during the London 2012 Olympics.

He said: ‘It’s difficult to overestimate what a traumatic time the last few weeks have been for some people in the UK. And the BBC has been at the heart of the story. Jimmy Savile was a BBC entertainer. It’s become apparent that some of the assaults he carried out were on BBC premises. To BBC employees today, the idea that such things could happen is almost beyond comprehension.

‘But although many of Savile’s crimes were committed decades ago, we are inheritors of the BBC’s past. And I should be the first to admit that we haven’t got everything right since this crisis started.

‘There are no short cuts: we have to acknowledge responsibility; apologise to victims; commit ourselves to finding out what happened; and cooperate as closely as possible with the police.’

The BBC has set up three independent reviews in the wake of the paedophilia revelations, one to establish why a Newsnight investigation into the scandal was shelved, another to look back at the culture and practices during Savile’s time at the BBC, and a third looking at processes for reporting sexual harassment.

Entwistle said the corporation had previously lost viewer trust with previous controversies such as the misleading trailer for a documentary featuring the Queen, and irregularities over BBC-run phone-in competitions, but had managed to regain it.

Entwistle apologised again to the victims of Jimmy Savile's abuse. He admitted that since the start of the scandal, the corporation hadn't 'got anything right'

He explained: ‘During editorial troubles in the last decade – there was a marked falling off in trust from our audiences. Because they set the highest standards for us, they rightly feel more keenly disappointed when we fail to measure up.

‘Yet, even when the public felt most let down, they still believed that the BBC could be trusted to put things right itself. And we did. The rigour and honesty with which the BBC handled past crises renewed our audiences’ confidence in us. My determination is that we accomplish this again.’

Entwistle re-iterated his public apology to the victims of Savile’s abuse and said the broadcaster was working with children’s charities to provide the best possible support for those affected.

His speech comes after Entwistle faces accusations it took him, or his office, three weeks to contact police about a letter he received containing allegations Jimmy Savile abused children on BBC premises.

Untrustworthy: George Entwistle highlighted that the BBC had made mistakes before yet managed to re-earn people's trust

A letter was sent from ITV on September 7 containing details of allegations it would be making on its Exposure programme, which first revealed the extent of Savile’s abuse.

But the BBC did not contact police or begin its own investigation until early October, when details of the content of the ITV programme were made public.

The conclusions of the Pollard Review, looking into the axed Newsnight investigation, are expected to be delivered by the end of the month.
