Graeme Swann has repeated his call for Alastair Cook to relinquish his place in England's one-day side, likening the team's current methods to a 'two-litre diesel in a Formula One race'.

Swann, who retired from cricket during England's miserable winter tour to Australia, earlier this week urged captain Cook to give up his limited-overs place and allow the likes of Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Vince and James Taylor the chance to show what they can do in a more exciting and attacking line-up.

Swann believes England's current 'outdated' ODI approach and tactics means they have no chance of winning next year's World Cup.

Cook responded to his former team-mate's comments after England's crushing 133-run Royal London Series defeat to India on Wednesday by saying: 'I don't think it's that helpful - especially from a so-called friend' - but Swann is refusing to back down.

He wrote in his column in The Sun on Friday: 'Real mates are honest with each other. I'm no longer in the England dressing room and it is my job now as a pundit to give my honest thoughts.

'I think being one-day captain is a poisoned chalice for him. He just doesn't need the job. The cricket England are playing in 50-over cricket is outdated and I fear it will be a painful winter for the team.

'I don't want him to be part of it. This is not a witch-hunt against 'Cookie' and I'm still a huge supporter of his captaincy in Test cricket. But, in one-day matches, I want England to play the exciting cricket they promised six months ago when Peter Moores took over as head coach.

'We're happy to tootle along in a two-litre diesel in a Formula One race.

'England must change their strategy to have any chance of winning the World Cup.

'I'm 100 per cent behind him as Test captain. But, in one-day cricket, you should pick your 11 best players and choose your captain from there and I don't think he is one of the best 11 players.'
