Sir Cliff Richard is set to miss his annual trip to New York for the US Open while he faces underage sex abuse allegations.

The tennis fan, 73, could be prevented from entering the United States while he is questioned by British detectives over accusations he sexually assaulted a boy in the 1980s.

The singer visits Flushing Meadows for the tournament every year, but border officials could block him when he lands on US soil - even though he owns a flat in the city.

According to the US Embassy website, 
suspects arrested 'for an offence or crime involving moral turpitude' 
will have their visa applications rejected. However those questioned 
under caution are assessed on a 'case-by-case' basis.

He can make a personal visit to the US Embassy to argue his case for a visa.

However, a source told The Sun: 'You would be mad to try to get on a plane if you had a child abuse inquiry hanging over you.'

A spokesman for the US Embassy in London told the newspaper: 'We do not comment on individuals.'

Earlier this year Nigella Lawson was 
prevented from travelling to Los Angeles after a court was told she 
had taken to cocaine.

Sir
 Cliff has been assured he will not be arrested when he returns from his
 vineyard in Portugal, but he will be interviewed under caution.

Police
 were yesterday forced to defend their decision to allow the BBC access 
to their raid on Sir Cliff’s Sunningdale, Berkshire, home on Thursday.

 false': Sir Cliff, pictured at the FM Algarve studio on Sunday, has

under the age of 16 in the 1980s

The singer said he was angry that the first he knew of the operation was when he saw it on television.

He accused officers of leaking information to ‘the Press’, mistakenly suggesting newspapers had also been tipped off.

A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police, who are leading the investigation, said: ‘When a media outlet contacted South Yorkshire Police with information about an investigation, we took the decision to work with them in order to protect the integrity of that investigation.

'Since the search took place, a number of people have contacted the police to provide information and we must acknowledge that the media played a part in that, for which we are grateful.’

Upset: Fans from all over the world have rushed to defend Sir Cliff after the allegations

'For
 many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic 
impropriety which have been circulating online. The allegations are 
completely false.

'Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen.

'However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except, it would appear, to the press.

'I am not presently in the UK but it goes without saying that I will co-operate fully should the police wish to speak to me.

'Beyond
 stating that today's allegation is completely false it would not be 
appropriate to say anything further until the police investigation has 
concluded.'

Police refused to comment on the nature of the information they had received. Their investigation centres on claims that Sir Cliff sexually assaulted a boy at an event in  Sheffield held by the American preacher Billy Graham in 1985.

Sir Cliff, who has dismissed the accusations as ‘completely false’, is expected to cut short his holiday in Portugal to meet detectives within days. Officers said they were keen to speak to him ‘as soon as possible’.

The singer’s lawyers are in talks with the police about a single allegation of serious sexual assault reported by a man in his 40s.

Stung by criticism from Sir Cliff and his fans, Jonathan Munro, the BBC’s head of news-gathering, took the unusual step of going on Twitter to confirm that the source of its original story was not South Yorkshire Police, but refused to say who it was.

Thames Valley Police, which provided five of the eight officers who searched Sir Cliff’s home over five hours, were also quick to deny any leak to media outlets.

The Mail understands that a BBC  producer acting on a tip-off phoned South Yorkshire Police, who confirmed the timing of the raid so that police could carry out their inquiries before the story broke.

Detectives were concerned that any advance publicity would have given Sir Cliff prior warning, risking ‘the integrity of the investigation’.

Old
 friend: Sir Cliff’s former manager Bill Latham, pictured together, who 
lived with the star for 30 years, denounced the allegations as 
‘fiction’.

Support:

Wimbledon in 2011) said yesterday: ‘I’ve never seen Cliff put a foot or a 
word wrong in his life, never. He is a gorgeous man’

Sir
 Cliff Richard was furious that members of the press appeared to find 
out his luxury UK flat was being raided by police before he did.

Crews for the BBC were positioned outside the private estate where the singer has a £3.1million property as police swooped in.

And the BBC appeared to have a pre-recorded interview with a leading police officer involved in the case. 

In his statement, Sir Cliff pointedly said that he had been given no notice of the search.

The
 singer said: 'However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire 
today without notice, except, it would appear, to the press.

'I am not presently in the UK but it goes without saying that I will co-operate fully should the police wish to speak to me.'

He was in the Algarve when he learned of the raid, and his publicist promptly issued a strong denial of the claim.

It is not clear if the singer plans to return to the UK.

A spokesman from the BBC declined to comment on the source of their story.

The force also provided the BBC with an exclusive interview with Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, which was broadcast within moments of the raid starting. Tory MP Nigel Evans said ‘questions have got to be answered’ about the BBC’s presence at Sir Cliff’s home.

He told Good Morning Britain: ‘It appears the Press knew what was happening before he did and the world’s media were camped outside his doorstep.

'A Press helicopter was up before the police even arrived – he is quite right to be angry about that.’

The allegation against Sir Cliff first emerged in October 2012 when the alleged victim contacted Mark Williams-Thomas, an investigative journalist and former detective who worked on an ITV documentary exposing Jimmy Savile.

Yesterday, Mr Williams-Thomas confirmed that he had also passed new information to the police about Sir Cliff in addition to the allegations he heard from the alleged victim.

The singer has strenuously denied the claims but stressed that he would ‘co-operate fully should the police wish to speak to me’.

He said: ‘For many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic impropriety which have been circulating online.

'The allegations are completely false.’ Yesterday, the singer arrived at his £3million Algarve home with friends without stopping to make any  comment to journalists.

Portuguese police confirmed they have not been asked to search his holiday home.

'Passionate': Sir Cliff with Una Stubbs

According to his biographer, Steve Turner, Sir Cliff has only had three significant partners.

It has been widely reported that he lost his virginity at 18 to Carol Harris, the wife of Shadows bandmate Jet.

In a biography he dismissed the affair as mere infatuation, claiming that what happened between them was 'not right', and painting her as his seductress.

At 22, he had a passionate affair with actress Una Stubbs, then 24, on the set of the film Wonderful Life, released in 1964.

In the early Eighties he enjoyed a three-year friendship with former Wimbledon ace Sue Barker, even at one point considering marriage.

In 2010 a letter written by Sir Cliff to then girlfriend Delia wicks in 1961 emerged.

In the Dear John letter, sent as he toured Australia, he wrote: 'Being a pop singer I have to give up one priceless thing – the right to any lasting relationship with any special girl.

'I've just had to make, probably, one of the biggest decisions I'm ever going to make and I'm hoping that it won't hurt you too much.'

In the 1980s, he considered marriage to Sue Barker, the former tennis champion and host of the BBC's Question of Sport.

Sir Cliff is often accompanied by his trusted companion and friend, former Roman Catholic priest John McElynn.

Once an American missionary, Mr McElynn has been friends with the singer for more than a decade and looks after his property portfolio.

Sir Cliff once said of him: 'He has become a companion, which is great, because I don't like living alone'.
