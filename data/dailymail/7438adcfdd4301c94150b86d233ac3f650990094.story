It was once a grim home for the desperately poor - forced to hard labour to save themselves from a life on the streets of Victorian London.

But now, you would need to pick more than a pocket or two to afford to live in this stunning home, built on the site of a workhouse which inspired Dickens to write Oliver Twist.

The Grade II listed nine bedroom home is on the former site of the famous Kensington Workhouse, demolished in 1849, and which is thought to have been one of the inspirations for the 1838 novel.

The property has now been put on the market for £13.5 million - 80 times the average price of a home in England and Wales.

The workhouse made way for a number of grand mansions and a garden square known as Kensington Gate

Recently renovated, the stunning Grade II listed townhouse was put on the market yesterday for £13.5 million

But while the location's past is associated with extreme poverty, you'll need to 'pick a pocket or two' of the super-rich to afford this home - which includes several dining rooms

Recently renovated, the stunning Grade II listed townhouse - with spacious living areas -  was put on the market yesterday for £13.5 million

According to historical documents, Kensington Workhouse was built 'to contain upwards of four hundred paupers, and has an infirmary with airing grounds detached from the main building.

'The total length of frontage is 262 feet, the whole of which is given to the aged and infirm, with arcades for exercise and a garden in front.

'The able-bodied and younger classes are kept more immediately under the eye of the master and matron.'

Originally designed by Hammersmith architect Alfred Cubitt Beam, the home on Kensington Gate has nine bedrooms, a separate mews house, basement leisure centre and staff quarters.

It also boasts a bespoke David Linley kitchen, study, bar area, gymnasium and wine store which connects the main house with the mews house.

The original workhouse is thought to have been one of the inspirations for the 1838 novel Oliver Twist, with the building demolished in 1849

According to historical documents, Kensington Workhouse, which inspired the Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist - made into a film in 1968 -  was built 'to contain upwards of four hundred paupers, and has an infirmary with airing grounds detached from the main building'

The workhouse was built in 1847-8, in the parish of St Mary Abbots, Kensington. The building later became St Mary Abbots Hospital

The building, designed by Thomas Allom, was a Jacobean style red-brick construction. Historical documents say 'The total length of frontage is 262 feet, the whole of which is given to the aged and infirm, with arcades for exercise and a garden in front. 'The able-bodied and younger classes are kept more immediately under the eye of the master and matron'

And as the property counts as two, any buyer will be eligible for four parking permits - something super-desirable in London.

Shirley Humphrey, director at Harrods Estates which is selling the property, said: 'This house provides the rare opportunity to purchase a large London family house and mews that can be arranged to provide up to nine bedrooms.

'Close to Hyde Park and Kensington High Street, the house overlooks a lovely private garden square and is ideal for families wanting extra space in a prime central London location.'

Alan Russell, director at Russell Simpson, which is marketing the property, said: 'The large Italianate houses of Kensington Gate are a popular choice for families who want to live in the heart of Kensington and be near an array of local schools rated by Ofsted.'
