Shameless bosses of cosmetic surgery firms that go bankrupt and leave patients in the lurch are to be blocked from running new health clinics.

A Government crackdown will mean the directors of surgery firms that go bust, as well as those found guilty of providing poor care, will not be allowed to shut up shop simply to open weeks later under a new name.

In 2012, The Mail on Sunday revealed how The Harley Medical Centre chain of cosmetic surgery clinics went into administration to avoid possible payouts to 13,000 patients who had been given faulty PIP breast implants.

Crackdown: Directors of surgery firms that go bust will not be allowed to shut up shop simply to open weeks later under a new name

The company appointed administrators after its management complained that legal action could put the firm out of business.

But within days, and using a slightly different company name, the clinics reopened with many of the same directors in charge.

13,000 patients of The Harley Medical Centre were given faulty PIP breast implants

Last week, the Department of Health announced the introduction of a ‘fit and proper person test’. For the first time, dishonest and incapable bosses will be refused a licence to run a health clinic by the regulator, the Care Quality Commission.

The rules will apply to those holding top jobs in both the NHS and private sector and will also mean that unfit directors can be removed from their job.

Norman Lamb, the Care and Support Minister, said: ‘This test will allow us to make sure that those leading health and care organisations are up to the job  – and to remove those who are not, including those who have presided over poor care.’

Jan Spivey, from the campaign group PIP Action, which represents victims of the breast implant scandal, said: ‘Finally, we can see the Department of Health are addressing some of the issues the PIP scandal exposed.

‘But we are disappointed it has taken this long. We are still fighting to get compensation for victims of the PIP scandal and this announcement will do little to help with that battle.’
