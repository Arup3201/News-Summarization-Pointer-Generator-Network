The parents of an eight-month-old girl who died after she became wedged between the bed and wall of a Connecticut hotel room were visiting the area to appear on The Maury Show.

They were reportedly there to film an episode that was meant to reveal the identity of the child's biological father. 

On Wednesday morning the 27-year-old mother woke up at the Stamford Plaza Hotel to find that her baby wasn't breathing and told officers the child must have fallen off the bed in the middle of the night, according to police.

Her story was supported by the 25-year-old man who said he woke up when he heard the mother scream, according to NBC New York. 

An autopsy revealed there was no evidence the infant had experienced physical or sexual abuse, or neglect. A cause of death has not yet been confirmed, according to Stamford Police Lt. Diedrich Hohn.

The couple also have a two-year-old son, who was sleeping in the same bed as his mother was was unharmed. 

Police said the Department of Children and Families and Child Guidance have been notified.

No criminal charges have been filed. 

Hohn confirmed that the family had traveled from Ohio to film an episode for Maury Povich's daytime talk show, but would not comment on their specific segment would be about.

A source, who asked to remain unidentified, told the Stamford Advocate the episode was going to reveal on-air who the infant's biological father was based on the results of a paternity test. 

The Maury Show is infamous for its dramatic paternity reveals to the point where Maury's big reveal on whether the man is question is the father has become a catchphrase in itself. 

Hohn revealed to the Stamford Advocate that multiple glasses and bottles of alcohol were strewn across the couple's hotel room, and that they had been drinking in the hotel lobby. 

But he said investigators were still unsure if alcohol had played a role or if there was an issue of child endangerment in the infant's death. 

He said the Stamford State Attorney's office will decide whether to file any charges against the couple. 

An NBCUniversal spokesman said 'everyone at The Maury Show' was 'deeply saddened by this profound tragedy'.
