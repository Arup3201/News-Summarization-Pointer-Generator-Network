A boy of four who spoke no English and only a few words of Polish was locked in a room for days at a time in an ‘incomprehensible’ campaign of cruelty, a court was told.

Finally, Daniel Pelka was allegedly left for 33 hours to die in his home-made cell after a violent assault.

His mother, Magdelena Luczak, 27, said she did not call for paramedics because she feared going to prison.

Magdalena Luczak told the jury that Mariusz Krezolek, the stepfather of Daniel Pelka, 'hated' the four-year-old and had given him physical punishments, including squats, almost every day

But she maintained it was not her 
fault that Daniel had died, and blamed her former boyfriend, Mariusz 
Krezolek, 34, for hitting him on the head.

Luczak and Krezolek, who came to 
England from Poland in 2006, deny murdering Daniel and causing or 
allowing the death of a child at their home in Coventry.

The boy was allegedly locked in his 
cell with no door handle on the inside, starved and force-fed salt as 
punishment for taking food from the fridge.

Another child in the family said 
Daniel was prevented from using the toilet and pistachios and biscuits 
were taken for him when he was not allowed to eat. Daniel was said to 
have been so hungry that he ate out of bins and stole his primary school
classmates’ packed lunches.

Despite two home visits from school 
staff and an appointment with a paediatrician, he was found dead on 
March 3 last year weighing 15lb below the average weight for a child of 
his age.

One expert in child deaths said his body could be compared to that of a child starving in a concentration camp.

Luczak yesterday denied killing 
Daniel. ‘I was downstairs in the living room and I heard some screams. 
Mariusz was shouting at Daniel,’ she told the jury at Birmingham Crown 
Court.

‘I went upstairs, Daniel was crying. Mariusz was shouting at him because Daniel wet himself.

‘I told him, “He is in fear of you”. Mariusz hit him in the back of his head and Daniel fell to the front of him,’ she said.

‘He grabbed him by the T-shirt and 
dragged him to the boxroom, there he hit him again, and he knocked him 
down to the mattress, he hit him on the right side of the head.

‘I shouted at him not to hit him on 
his head. Because I shouted he grabbed me by the neck to calm me down, I
don’t remember what happened later.’ Luczak said she realised her son 
was unconscious at 9am the next morning but didn’t call for help until 
2.45am the following day.

‘I was afraid, they would take away my child and I would be in prison,’ she added.

Earlier she insisted she thought 
Daniel was being fed well at school, even though he weighed just 1st7lb 
when he died in March last year.

‘Mariusz would check his belly and he would say that there’s a slight bump on his belly,’ she said.

‘He would ask Daniel if he was taking
any sandwiches [from his school]. Daniel was so scared that he would 
always confess and say yes he had.

‘Mariusz didn’t allow me to give him food and he said he was well fed at school.’

Speaking with the help of a translator, Luczak said she often saw her child eat.

‘In the morning before he left for school, I was giving him breakfast and I was packing his packed lunch.

‘On the way to school I would buy him something sweet and after school Daniel wouldn’t eat any more,’ she said.

Luczak claim Daniel was starved because Mariusz Krezolek was preventing her from properly caring for him

Questioned by Stephen Linehan, QC, 
defending, Luczak admitted she had not cared for Daniel between 
September 2011 and February 10, 2012, three weeks before he died.

Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC told the 
court: ‘Daniel was subjected to a campaign of incomprehensible and 
escalating cruelty. When doctors tried to measure his BMI (body mass 
index) it was too low to be measured on the scale.’

Prosecutors allege that after the 
‘violent assault’ Krezolek wrote in a text message: ‘He’ll get over it 
by tomorrow. There’s no point to call the ambulance as that will cause 
proper problems.’

He  was pronounced dead at University Hospital in Coventry.

He had 24 injuries to his head, body and all four limbs. Tests showed higher than normal sodium levels in his system.

The case continues.
