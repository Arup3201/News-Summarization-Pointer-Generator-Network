A year-old fawn was dramatically rescued from a manhole by police after it fell down the 10-foot concrete pipe.

Sheriff’s deputies for Davis County in Utah were able to rescue the terrified deer by putting a climbing rope around its neck and hoisting it up.

The rescue was recorded by another one of the sheriffs.

According to ABC 4, several teenagers alerted authorities that the deer was stuck in a manhole at Nicolas Park in Davis County, Utah.

It was unclear how long the creature had been stuck, but police officers saw the animal had no access to food or water. ‘We knew the deer wasn’t going to last long in the hole,’ Sgt Todd Taylor told the station.

The video shows a sheriff’s deputy fashioning a lasso out of bright orange rope. After several attempts to get the rope around its body, they were successful.

While they were pulling the animal up to safety, the deer let out a frightened bellow.

However, the law enforcement officials told ABC 4 that it was better that the fawn experience a few moments of discomfort rather than starving to death.

‘We would always rather see an animal get released back into the wild,’ Sgt Susan Poulsen said.

As fate would have it, the most difficult job the sheriffs had was just that. The spooked deer managed to get to its feet within a matter of seconds and immediately tried running off into the woods, with the orange rope still around its neck.

After a failed attempt, a sheriff managed to untangle the deer, and he bolted off into the nearby woods.

‘The deer was happy when it was released, so I guess it was a good, happy ending,’ Sgt Pouslen said.
