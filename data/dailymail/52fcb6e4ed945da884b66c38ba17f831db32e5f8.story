A high-flying Google exec with a passion for super-fast, top of the line sports cars has proved himself to have an equally good sense of humor, when it comes to his boy's toys.

As vice president of engineering and long-time Google employee, Benjamin Sloss Treynor, 43, became an instant millionaire at the time of the company’s $23 billion IPO in 2004.

That wealth has afforded Treynor the finances to be able to indulge his passion for collecting some of the most exclusive sports cars around, including a Ford Raptor, a Ferrari 458 Italia, and a McLaren 12C Spyder, which he keeps in his six-car garage.

Treynor isn’t shy about his collection either and as with any self respecting tech nerd he is very active in chat forums sharing his passion with other sports car nuts.

Sometimes Treynor’s candidness about his car collection has got him into trouble with other forum members of the SVT 
Performance forum, most of whom can only dream of having a car collection as exotic as his.

One forum member recently questioned if Treynor could really own all the top of the lines vehicles which he claims too and challenged him to prove he owned what he said he did with an usual task involving placing bread on some of his most exclusive rides.

'I don’t think you’re real. I request a 
picture of your new 12C Spyder with a piece of bread on the hood,' wrote
 one poster, who posted under the username Ford-racer.

Treynor may be very important and very 
rich, but as is the Google ethos he is also something of a regular guy -
 as he proved by rising to the challenge set by his forum buddy.

Not only did Treynor comply on Sunday by posting a picture of his extremely rare McLaren 12C Spyder, but he photographed some English crumpets on top, as befitting a British-built vehicle.

Treynor captioned his Spyder photo saying 'the art and science of the British sports car lives on at McLaren, and nothing says "God Save The Queen" like crumpets!'

He didn't stop there either, for a photo of his brand-new high-performance Ford Raptor truck, Treynor placed a loaf of New York Rye Bread. 'Nothing says "USA" like 'FORD', and what better pairing than a great loaf of New York Rye?' he wrote.

Then on top of his Ferrari he placed Italian bread. He wrote: 'Nothing complements the smell of fine Italian leather like the smell of fresh Italian bread!'

Ford_racer, real name Kyle Hirschi, told Wired that he knew Treynor was legit, but came up with the bread on the hood idea as an inside joke after the Google exec was called out by someone else on the forum.

On the SVT Performance forum user ford_racer asked Treynor to post pictures of bread on his cars

Sense of humor: Further evidence of Treynor's humor can be found on his Google+ profile

In the past, Treynor had responded by posting a
 picture of his kid holding a sign that had the name of the SVT 
Performance forum on it.

'Treynor is easily one of the more genuine and down to earth people on SVTP,' said Hirschi. 'He’s never condescending or arrogant when showing off his toys, and he’s clearly a genuine car enthusiast.

'Many, many well-off people will buy these types of cars and let them rot in a garage or drive them like old men.'

In September, Treynor won an auction to buy a Ferrari 599XX Evo that was being sold to benefit victims of an earthquake in Northern Italy.

Treynor, who has been at Google for nine years, carries a lot of responsibility and as the company’s site reliability tsar it is his job to ensure that their websites don’t go down.
