It was a gloomy day at Westminster today when Samantha Cameron accompanied David to the polling stations where they were to vote in the London Mayoral election.

But the Prime Minister's wife made sure to cut a swathe through the grey as she stepped out in a pair of bright orange trousers.

She paired the tapered style, a pair of £39.99 cigarette pants from Zara, with an ivory blouse, grey round-necked jumper from high street store Cos and a pair of grey suede LK Bennett heels.

'Nice trousers, darling!' David Cameron admires his wife's orange Zara cigarette pants as the two arrive at Westminster's Central Methodist Hall for the London Mayoral and local elections

Lucky outfit? Samantha Cameron wore an almost identical outfit last October at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, right, even down to the grey sweater and suede pumps

It was a striking look for SamCam, and clearly one that she is fond of given that she wore the exact same ensemble, give or take a neckline, for the Conservative Party Conference last year.

Samantha debuted the vibrant cigarette pants back in October, when she paired them with a grey V-neck sweater from Zara, and the same grey LK Bennett pumps she wore today.

The look is a tried-and-tested one for the PM's wife, and one that skilfully treads that delicate line between adventurous and sensible.

The sobering effect of the schoolgirl grey sweater acts as the perfect foil for the tropical tone of her bottom half, and the grey shoes pull the look together neatly.

Slim silhouette: Cigarette pants are a flattering cut, elongating and slimming the legs, though they are unforgiving on the bottom, so best suit someone with a slender figure like Samantha's

It is an outfit that says 'I'm fashionable, quirky, contemporary - but dependable and approachable'.

The juicy tangerine toned trousers are a welcome break from the norm, given that Samantha Cameron, while frequently fashion-forward, more often than not favours her trusty black Joseph cigarette
pants for public events.

But where her tailoring is sober, elsewhere, Samantha is no stranger to colour in her wardrobe.

She may favour simplicity on so many occasions, but she is
equally at home in bright pink Roksanda Illincic, for example, or jade 
green Burberry.

A confident dresser, she is never afraid to experiment with her style, and manages to 
mix high fashion, high-end pieces into her more sober 'political wife' 
wardrobe with aplomb.

Playing it safe: Accompanying her Labour leader husband Ed to the polling station, Justine Miliband wore an unadventurous look of jeans, navy blazer and brown boots

Indeed, one political wife who could take a leaf out of Samantha Cameron's book is Justine MIliband, who accompanied her Labour leader husband Ed to the polling station today.

Wearing baggy jeans and an uninspiring navy blazer, she failed to set Westminster alight.

As for Nick Clegg's wife Miriam, whose style leans towards the flamboyant, she was nowhere to be seen. 

A clear win for Samantha Cameron, whatever the outcome at the polling booths.
