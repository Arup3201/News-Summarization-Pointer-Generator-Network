A property tycoon and Labour donor tried to withdraw £2.5 million from his son-in-law’s joint bank account with his daughter after the couple split up, court documents have claimed.

Sir David Garrard, who is said to be worth more than £100 million, has been accused of trying to take money from the account of son-in-law Alexander Salter and daughter Alanah.

After Mr Salter started a relationship with Ms Garrard, the men jointly set up LX Capital, a venture capital 
business.

They then used it to buy a second firm, SamKnows, 
which measures broadband internet performance, the Telegraph reports.

But a dispute arose between the men when the couple split up in November, 2012.

In papers lodged at the High Court, Sir David claims he treated Mr Salter 'as his own son'.

He claims he gave him a £2million loan to buy the company SamKnows and then £747,000 more.

Mr Salter, however, claims 'the claimant sought to remove the sum of £2.5 million from 
the joint bank account of the defendant and Alanah without the authority
 of the defendant or, to the best of the defendant’s knowledge, Alanah'.

Sir David is also suing Mr Salter after he vetoed the appointment of Labour peer Lord Mendelsohn as a director of their two companies

It is not clear from the papers why the alleged withdrawal attempt occurred.

Sir David is also suing Mr Salter after he vetoed the appointment of Labour peer Lord Mendelsohn as a director of the two companies, claiming that he had 'been involved in 
corruption scandals involving cash for access to government ministers 
and secret loans made to the Labour party' and was a 'politically 
exposed person'.

Sir David said Mr Salter's objections were unreasonable, as Lord Mendelsohn had been the 'victim of inaccurate smears.'

The case has been lodged at the High Court and is expected to be heard later this year.

Sir David loaned Labour £2.3 million before the 2005 general election.

In 2005, he was put forward for a peerage but asked for his name to be withdrawn.

Three years later, he turned £300,000 of the loan into a donation.

Following publication of this article, we were contacted by Sir David. He says the money in the bank account was not Mr Salter’s, but a sum his daughter received following the death of her mother, and his daughter authorised him to transfer it to another institution.
