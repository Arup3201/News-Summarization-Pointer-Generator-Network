A grandmother was killed and an 18-month-old girl left fighting for her life in a second horror crash in 24 hours over the Easter weekend.

Two other girls, aged one and three, and two adults, all travelling in the same car were also seriously injured.

All six were members of the same family travelling in a silver Honda Accord when it collided with a Volkswagen Golf at about 11.30am on Easter Sunday.

The driver of the Golf, a 60-year-old man from Epsom in Surrey, was taken to hospital with serious chest injuries.

His 58-year-old female passenger, also from Epsom, was treated for whiplash injuries from the crash, which resulted in the A24 road near Warnham in West Sussex being closed for around five hours.

The tragedy happened a day after a father and his teenage son were killed in a crash that also claimed the life of a pensioner in the other car. The woman killed in Sunday’s crash, a 56-year-old from Queen’s Park in North West London, was a passenger in the back of the car. She was pronounced dead at the scene by an air ambulance doctor.

Accident investigators are trying to figure out how the two cars collided. The driver of the Golf was taken to hospital for serious chest injuries and the passenger was treated for whiplash

The three toddlers were taken to St George’s Hospital in Tooting, South West London, for treatment, along with the 34-year-old driver and a 26-year-old female passenger.

Sergeant Paul Skinner, of Sussex Police, said: ‘This is a desperately tragic incident that has left a toddler fighting for her life. A full investigation is now under way.’

In the earlier tragedy, Derek Sarkar, 46, and his 14-year-old son Ethan were killed in a head-on collision near the village of East Cowick, East Yorkshire.

Sheila Stavert-Lee, 70, the driver of the other car, was also killed. Yesterday it emerged that she had been travelling from her home in York to visit her paedophile husband Anthony Barry Lee in Doncaster Prison when the crash happened on Saturday afternoon.

Lee was branded a ‘monster’ by police and jailed for seven years after he was convicted in December of sexually abusing two generations of the same family over a period of 21 years.
