Bloomingdale’s is hitting back against crafty shoppers who buy special occasion merchandise only to return it after a single wear.

The store is now attaching what they call a ‘B-tag’ to dresses in visible spots, like hemlines. Once removed, a dress will be rendered nonreturnable under new conditions outlined by the national retailer.

The B-tag, first reported by Bloomberg on Tuesday, has been attached to all dresses retailing for over $150, a store associate in the chain’s SoHo, New York location told MailOnline. The associate also said that the device is being used at all of Bloomindale’s nationwide outlets.

Hitting back: Bloomingdale's will now include this B-tag, snapped in-store by MailOnline, on all dresses that retail for more than $150

New measures: Customers will not be able to return a garment once the bulky B-tag is removed. Instructions are provided to help shoppers take the tag off of merchandise.

The store’s e-commerce business has also picked up on the practice. Online ‘details’ indicate when items will be delivered with a B-tag attached. ‘Please note that this dress will be delivered with a black B-tag attached, with instructions for removal included. If the B-tag is removed, the dress cannot be returned,’ reads an online description for a French Connection ‘opal sequin’ dress.

The SoHo store associate told MailOnline that, for now, dresses are the only item at Bloomingdale's to receive the B-tag. Bloomberg says that the retailer is ‘using the tactic to combat a practice known as “wardrobing” — buying clothes and using them once — a form of return fraud.’ They say that the ‘National Retail Federation estimates [“wardrobing”] cost the industry $8.8 billion last year.’

Internet option: Online shoppers will also find B-tags affixed to dresses they purchase from Bloomingdales.com

MailOnline paid a visit to the dress department of Bloomingdale’s SoHo location in search of the B-tag. We quickly discovered the large black plastic tag hanging out from underneath each dress’s hemline. 

The B-tag is a rudimentary piece of black plastic that
 resembles many of the store’s electronic security tags in bulk and 
size. The tag is not, however, electronically charged in any way.

Its teardrop shape and bulbous nature would make it difficult to wear a 
dress with it still attached. In this way, the B-tag tactic will likely prove very effective.

The B-tag does come with removal 
instructions, as promised on Bloomingdale’s website. However when MailOnline 
attempted to remove a B-tag from the hemline of Sue Wong beaded dress, using the instructions provided, the device’s concept 
seemed slightly less successful.

Widespread release: Bloomingdale's is already using the B-tag in all of its nationwide locations

‘To remove tag, lift “B” disk,’ an instruction card affixed to the dress explained. When MailOnline lifted the “B” disk, the B-tag’s tiny puncturing prong did indeed lift away from the dress a bit. But it became caught in the cocktailware’s polyester tulle webbing in the process. The garment would have ripped if we had pulled any tighter to release the tag.

When attempting to return the “B” disk to its original spot we discovered that once the disk is lifted, the device’s seal becomes irreversibly broken. Had MailOnline purchased the cocktail dress with the B-tag in this form, it would have likely been rejected by store associates.

A spokesperson for Bloomingdale's told MailOnline in a statement that the B-tags 'are in place to reinforce the fact that Bloomingdale’s will be unable to accept a return of merchandise that has been worn, washed, damaged, used and/or altered.'
