Canada's extreme northern territories have been devoid of forests for millions of years.

But the forests could be about to return, thanks to changing global temperatures, according to research at the University of Montreal, which suggests the freezing temperatures may mellow just enough to see the return of the ancient forests which once surrounded this icy area.

The fossilised forest found on Bylot Island in Nunavut is between 2.6
and 3 million years old according to estimations, based on the presence 
of extinct species and on paleomagnetic analyses.

Paleomagentic analysis
involves looking at how the Earth's magnetic field has affected the 
magnetic sediment in rocks - like a compass, they turn to follow the 
magnetic poles.

Scientists can use this information to date rocks as the
history of the movement of the magnetic poles is relatively well known.

Alexandre 
Guertin-Pasquier, of the University of Montreal's Department of 
Geography, presenting his findings at the Canadian Paleontology 
Conference in Toronto, said: 'According to the data model, climate 
conditions on Bylot Island will be able to support the kinds of trees we
find in the fossilised forest that currently exist there, such as 
willow, pine and spruce.

'I've also found evidence of a possible growth 
of oak and hickory near the study site during this period.

'Although it would of course take time for a 
whole forest to regrow, the findings show that our grandchildren should 
be able to plant a tree and watch it grow.'

Wood samples in the ancient forest have been preserved throughout the
eons in peat and by permafrost.

Guertin-Pasquier said: 'We studied the sediments in the forest
and discovered pollen that are usually found in climates where the 
annual average temperature is around 0 degrees Celsius or 32 
Fahrenheit.'

By comparison, current average 
conditions on Bylot Island are around -15°C ( 5°F).

The samples were 
taken from few drill holes 10 cm in diameter of one to two metres deep.

The harshness of the Arctic winter and the remoteness of the forest mean
that scientists have very little opportunity to delve into its secrets.

Even during the summer, the Guertin-Pasquier and his colleagues had to 
endure extreme conditions such as 80 km/h winds.

“There is so much 
mystery that surrounds this forest – for example, how these trees 
managed to survive the relentless dark of the Arctic winter,” he said, 
adding that the next steps for this line of research could include 
looking more closely at other plant remains in order to get a better 
understanding of what the local flora was.
