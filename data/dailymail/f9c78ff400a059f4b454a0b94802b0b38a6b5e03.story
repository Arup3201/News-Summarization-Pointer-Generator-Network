Liverpool's 1981 European Cup winner Alan Kennedy believes Cristiano Ronaldo is to Real Madrid what Kenny Dalglish and Graeme Souness were to the Reds' all-conquering side.

The Portugal international arrives on Merseyside for Wednesday's Champions League tie having just broken a 71-year-old La Liga record by scoring 15 goals in the first eight matches of the season.

While he is the player opponents have to worry most about, Kennedy - who scored the only goal as the Reds beat Madrid in the final at Parc de Princes 33 years ago - said in his day Liverpool had players whom worried their rivals.

While Madrid are strong favourites to take three points at Anfield on Wednesday, the Spanish side have never beaten Liverpool in the competition:

Liverpool 1-0 Real Madrid, May 26 1981

Real Madrid 0-1 Liverpool, Feb 25 2009

Liverpool 4-0 Real Madrid, March 10 2009 

"Ronaldo is that type of player. Is there anyone the equivalent of Ronaldo?" he told Press Association Sport.

"Looking back they (opponents) will say 'They had Dalglish and Souness'. Souness and Dalglish did it in my day.

"Souness was a player everyone admired and players who played alongside him will say he was the most influential player on the pitch because he was a leader, he wanted success.

"Ronaldo is slightly different. Although he has worked hard to play within the team, when he gets the ball he does excite everyone and that is what Dalglish did.

"Liverpool players have not got to have any fear about it, but have to be wary this guy can do anything with the ball."

Kennedy feels Brendan Rodgers' (above) side will be frustrated by their Champions League displays so far

Brendan Rodgers' side face back-to-back matches against the reigning European champions, who collected their 10th crown last May, and need to get something out of them having dropped to third in Group B with defeat against Basle last time out.

"It is a competition that is synonymous with Liverpool," he said of the five-time winners.

"Liverpool want to progress as far as they can and they have to pick up points against all the teams.

"They will be disappointed against Basle and against Ludogorets they scored with virtually the last kick of the game."
