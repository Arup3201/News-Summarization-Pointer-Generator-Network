Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini had a familiar feeling as he 
watched Sergio Aguero limp out of the clash with Nigeria.

His striker was taken off before half-time with what looked like another muscle injury.

Concern: Sergio Aguero receives treatment before being substituted against Nigeria

Aguero
 suffered a succession of calf, hamstring and thigh injuries during 
City's Premier League winning campaign so Pellegrini would have been 
keeping his fingers crossed for some good news on Wednesday night.

That's another fine Messi

Lionel Messi versus Neymar is turning out to be an interesting World Cup sub-plot.

The brilliant Argentinian took his tally for the tournament to four, level with his Brazilian rival.

First up: Lionel Messi's strike sails past Vincent Enyeama in the Nigeria goal for opening goal

Each player has his nation's hopes resting on his shoulders and neither is disappointing.

Messi now has 24 goals from 23 internationals, so where is the evidence
 for the accusation that he isn't as good for Argentina as he is for 
Barcelona?

Ezequiel 
Lavezzi's nickname is unfortunate and unfair. The 29-year-old Paris St 
Germain forward is known as 'El Pocho' - the Chubby One.

Impressive: Nigeria's Ahmed Musa scored twice against Argentina on Wednesday

The lowdown on two-goal Musa

Ahmed Musa scored two fine goals in Nigeria's defeat by Argentina. We will see more of him in this tournament with Nigeria making it through to the last 16 and here Sportsmail tells you more about the surprise package.

So, who is he?

A 21-year-old forward playing for CSKA Moscow. The Russian club signed him in 2012 after an impressive spell in the Dutch Eredivisie.

Clinical: Nigeria's Ahmed Musa scores his second goal against Argentina

Will I have ever seen him play?

If you followed Manchester City's Champions League campaign last season, you would. Musa featured in both group games. At the Etihad Stadium, he thought he had scored a late equaliser before his effort was ruled out with one of his teammates fouling in the build-up.

Is he any good then?

Musa has been highly regarded by a number of European clubs for several years now. While in Holland, the VV Venlo chairman revealed that he had turned down a â‚¬10million bid for the then 18-year-old.

A number of English clubs have been keeping an eye on him and after Wednesday's fine display, surely the interest will only grow.

Number of the day - 5
