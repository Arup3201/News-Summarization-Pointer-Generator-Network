A part-time snowplow driver was convicted Wednesday of luring a prep-school teacher out of her Vermont home under the guise of a broken down car and then killed her.

A jury rejected arguments by Allen Prue's defense that his wife, Patricia Prue, killed 33-year-old Melissa Jenkins in a jealous rage on March 25, 2012.

Prosecutors said the Prues lured Jenkins from her home as part of a long-planned crime. 

Jenkins' nude body was found the next day in the Connecticut River. She had been strangled.

Convicted: Allen Prue weeps in court on Wednesday after being found guilty of first-degree murder and two other charges in the 2012 slaying of Melissa Jenkins in Burlington, Vermont

Weak: Allen's attorneys had claimed he has an IQ of 75 and was easily manipulated by his wife, who they alleged was the murderer. They claimed Prue had no idea of her plan to kill Jenkins, who she was jealous of

Murdered: Melissa Jenkins, 33, a single mom and schoolteacher, was lured by the couple with a ruse of a broken down car. She was strangled to death and dumped in the Connecticut River

Patricia Prue, the wife Allen Prue, takes the stand during his murder trial in Vermont Superior Court on Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2014. She will be tried separately for the murder of Melissa Jenkins

Allen Prue, 32, cried when the jury's verdict was announced after six hours of deliberations. 

His lawyer had argued his client was unaware of his wife's plan to kill Jenkins.

Allen Prue was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy and attempted kidnapping in the death of Jenkins, a teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy.

Patricia Prue, 34, is being tried separately on an aggravated murder charge and other counts.

Her trial is yet to start. 

Prosecutors said Allen Prue gave a detailed confession to police that implicated both him and his wife.

Jenkins, a single mother, was reported missing on March 25, 2012, after her vehicle was found idling on her rural road with her two-year-old son inside. 

Prosecutors argued that the Prues called Jenkins and told her their car broke down, tricking her.

Caledonia County State's Attorney Lisa Warren said Allen Prue confessed he and his wife wanted to 'get a girl' as someone 'they could play with,' ABC News reported.

Up next: Patricia Prue's trial is set to start next month. She has pleaded not guilty, and her attorneys plan to argue the insanity defense. Prue is seen here in March 2012

Jealous: Allen's defense attorneys claim Patricia Prue (pictured left) grew jealous of Melissa Jenkins after her husband asked the teacher out on a date. Jenkins rebuffed Allen's advances and told friends she felt uncomfortable around him

Orphaned: Jenkins was reported missing when a friend found her car abandoned on the side of a road, with her two-year-old son alone inside. The boy later told authorities: 'Someone pulled on mommy's neck'

She also argued '[Jenkins] got out of her vehicle, and as she did, she was strangled and beaten to death.' 

The couple then took Jenkins' body back to their home where they removed all of her clothes, poured bleach on the body and wrapped her in a tarp.

They dumped the body in the Connecticut River, which separates Vermont from New Hampshire, weighing the body down with blocks, and burning the clothes and tarp.

Allen reported an hour late to his job delivering papers that night.

The next day, her nude, strangled and beaten body was found in a remote spot.

Allen Prue appears in court on the first day of his trial in Vermont Superior Court in Burlington, Vermont, on Wednesday October 8, 2014. He has now been found guilty

Police were led to the couple by a business card for Prue's plow business. 

Prue, who had plowed Jenkins' driveway, and his wife were arrested two days after she was killed.

When news broke that he was involved in the murder, his mother said that he had never been in trouble before and doubted that he committed the crime. 

The killing shocked the Northeast Kingdom, an area where violent crime is rare. 

Both Allen and Patricia Prue may face life sentences.
