Scotland Yard detectives have asked Moscow to provide DNA samples of a feared gangland hitman believed to be behind the violent attempt on a Russian banker's life in London last year.

German Gorbuntsov, 45, was shot six times by a lone assassin as he entered his flat on Byng Street in the capital's Docklands on March 20.

Despite initially falling into a coma he miraculously survived, but police are yet to discover who carried out the near-fatal shooting, which Gorbuntsov claims was ordered by shady Russian kingpins linked to Vladimir Putin.

Their prime suspect has been named as alleged Moldovan gun-for-hire Vitalie Proca, who is thought to be hiding out in Moscow.

Proca, whose mother-in-law has gone on Romanian television to protest his innocence, is also wanted by Romanian police who are seeking his extradition suspected of a separate shooting in Bucharest.

Police found a gun, a hoodie and a bag near the spot where Gorbuntsov was gunned down and say they managed to recover DNA that did not find a match when run through Scotland Yard's criminal database.

They are now hoping their Russian counterparts can shed light on their investigation that has so far drawn a blank.

Detective Chief Inspector Russell Taylor, who is leading the Gorbuntsov investigation, told The Independent: 'I’m hopeful that they [the Russians] will accede to our request but it’s very early days. I don’t know what their views are going to be.'

The request comes at a sensitive time in the relationship between British and Russian authorities amid mounting speculation over the recent death of the oligarch Boris Berezovsky
and the upcoming inquest into the death of Alexander Litvinenko, the 
former Russian secret service officer poisoned in London in 2006.

Gorbuntsov is currently holed up in a secret location in London as he continues his convalescence.

He told the Independent from his hospital bed last June that he believed the hit was orchestrated by people with connections to the Kremlin.

Big claims: Gorbuntsov says he believes the hit was orchestrated by people with connections to the Kremlin. He is currently holed up in a secret location in London as he continues his convalescence

He said he suspected the 
investigation was being held up because the men he has named claim to be 
friends of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.

Speaking via a Skype internet 
connection set up from his lawyers' Moscow office, he told the paper: 'The
evidence I have is enough to put them behind bars.

'Of course
they have good connections, but I'd like to believe there is justice in
Russia.'

The banker had fled to London to hide from his former business partners and said nobody knew where he was living.

But he noticed he was being followed in the days before the shooting.

He did not see the man who fired at him.

Doctors have told Mr Gorbuntsov he will need to remain in hospital for up to three months, although his condition is stable.

The
banker and his lawyers believe he was attacked because he was preparing
to give evidence to Russian prosecutors about a botched assassination 
attempt on his former business partner, Alexander Antonov.

Mr Antonov, father of Vladimir Antonov, the former owner of Portsmouth Football Club, was shot in Moscow in 2009 but survived.

In April last year, he told the Mail he had just stepped out of a taxi and 
was punching in the entry code to his apartment block when his would-be 
assassin emerged from the shadows and opened fire.

He said: ‘It had been an ordinary day and it was around 8pm when I got back home from my office in the City.

'I
tapped in the code and when I got to the third digit I suddenly felt a 
terrible sharp pain in my stomach, and then another, and another.'

investigation is being held up because the men he has named claim to be 
friends of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, right

Critical: German Gorbuntsov was taken to hospital by ambulance after the attack

Mr Gorbuntsov’s lawyer has said Mr Proca resembles the man captured 
on CCTV cameras and suspected of involvement in the shooting.

The case bears similarities with the poisoning of Russian intelligence agent Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006.

No one has been convicted of Mr Litvinenko's murder, which led to a cooling of relations between Britain and Moscow.
