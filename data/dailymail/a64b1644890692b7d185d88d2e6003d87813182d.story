Christopher Pyne has sounded a warning to his backbench colleagues to pull their heads in and stop muttering darkly about the federal government's performance.

The government ended its final week in parliament for the year lagging in the opinion polls with disgruntled MPs reporting disunity in party ranks.

Leader of the House Christopher Pyne, echoing language used by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, admitted the government had ended the year in a 'slightly ragged position'.

But in a pointed message to his grumbling colleagues, Mr Pyne said it was crucial they bounced back and pushed on with the job instead of 'wallowing'.

'What my colleagues need to understand is that they are advocates for the government's agenda,' he told Network Ten.

'My colleagues need to stop being background commentators and instead recognise that they are as much players on the field as I am or any other member of the leadership team.'

Rumours of a cabinet reshuffle, clashes of ego among senior ministers and anger over the handling of key policies such as the GP co-payment have fuelled backbench dissent in recent days.

The treasurer himself wasn't being drawn into the speculation, simply stating he'd be getting on with the job.

The latest Galaxy poll offered more bad news with primary support for the government plunging to 38 per cent.

Cabinet minister Bruce Billson conceded the government could better argue its case for reform in areas like higher education and health.

'On these other areas of structural reform, I think we need to be stronger in our advocacy that there is a need for policy action,' he told Sky News.

He dismissed rumours of a cabinet reshuffle with a cricket analogy, saying the team was strong and there wasn't a need to shake things up 'because one person drops a catch'.
