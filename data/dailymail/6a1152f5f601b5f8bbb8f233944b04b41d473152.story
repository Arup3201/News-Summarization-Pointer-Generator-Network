Controversial: Police asked the Mail not to reveal the vigilante's identity to protect his family

This is the Leicestershire man behind a disturbing phenomenon of vigilantes who set out to hunt down and trap suspected child sex offenders, and expose them on the internet.

He is the self-appointed leader of Letzgo Hunting, a gang that closed down this week just nine months after he set it up, following the suicide of a man it accused of grooming a pre-pubescent girl for sex over the internet.

The gang’s members acted as detectives, judges and jurors towards those they targeted.

First, a gang member would lure the men they suspected into the trap by striking up flirtatious conversations with them on the internet while posing as a young girl.

Next, they would agree to meet them, still pretending to be a young girl.

At that meeting, they would confront and film them before posting the footage on the internet and giving their ‘evidence’ to the police.

Though police have criticised its methods, the group’s controversial activities have led to at least ten arrests. None has been charged with sex offences and it remains to be seen whether they are guilty of anything.

And while they claimed they were behind the jailing this week of pub manager James Stone on child sex charges, police say evidence collected by the group played no part in the conviction.

The irony is that these self-appointed investigators — whose aim was to expose the men they suspected to the full glare of publicity — operated undercover, refusing to identify themselves to the police or anyone else, claiming they risked revenge attacks.

This week, when we tracked down their leader, he begged us not to expose him, for fear that he and his family would become targets.

Indeed, it was his fear of being identified publicly — rather than the suicide of a man he hounded — that caused him to close down his gang.

Yesterday, Leicester police also asked us not to identify him. ‘We believe there is a realistic chance of him coming to some harm,’ they said.

‘Feelings on issues surrounding paedophilia run very high, both against those accused and against those who make such allegations.’

We have agreed to abide by the police’s request  — though with deep reservations, because there is no doubt this man in his black hoodie top is a highly questionable figure.

This does not mean, however, we cannot tell you his story or try to explain why he took the law into his own hands in his war on paedophiles.

The Letzgo warrior is convinced he is a messenger from God crusading against those who have committed heinous crimes and that he is entitled to punish them. In his 20s, he is almost evangelical about his work.

But this week, the methods and motives of his gang were criticised after the inquest of Gary Cleary, a 29-year-old engineer who hanged himself just days after the vigilante gang accused him of grooming a young girl.

The police, NSPCC and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre were concerned about the gang’s activities, saying they risked jeopardising police investigations.

Many claimed the videos the gang posted online of the men they suspected rarely met the tough evidential requirements needed for a criminal prosecution.

'We believe there is a realistic chance of him coming to some harm. Feelings
 on issues surrounding paedophilia run very high, both against those 
accused and against those who make such allegations.'

But what motivated this crusader? Was it the fact that his father was once attacked by a gang of vigilantes and left badly beaten?

And how does he reconcile his group’s activity with police criticism and the death of a young man?

Letzgo’s leader, who lives with his girlfriend, who is also in her 20s, rejects  the suggestion his activities circumvent the legal system.

He also refuses to countenance the idea that he and his gang may have contributed to Cleary’s death. He claims Mr Cleary ‘killed himself because he tried to meet a child for sex’.

He adds: ‘All our evidence was sent to the police. It’s not my fault the police sent someone to arrest him. They were the last ones to handle him.’

He refused to talk further about the case, pulling his hood over his head  and driving off in his convertible car with his girlfriend and their child.

But we can reveal exactly what happened to Mr Cleary. He went online and hooked up by mistake with one of the vigilante group, who was pretending to be a 14-year-old girl. Mr Cleary, they say, showed an interest in meeting the ‘girl’ for sex.

Suicide: Gary Cleary who killed himself in May

A meeting was arranged in a park in Leicester. It took place four months ago. In fact, the vigilantes sent an 18-year-old as a decoy.

When confronted, Mr Cleary was said to have sworn at members of Letzgo Hunting filming the encounter. He then left the park. The group say they sent a ‘file’ of evidence to Leicester Police.

Subsequently, Mr Cleary was questioned by a police officer and released on bail in May. He was not charged with any criminal offence.

However, four days later he was found hanged in his garage at his home. The inquest into his death found he had committed suicide, though the coroner did not refer to any encounter with Letzgo Hunting or his arrest.

While the truth about Mr Cleary’s intentions will never be known, the group insists it was doing an important public duty by monitoring the internet to protect children from paedophiles.

Letzgo Hunting was inspired by an American TV programme, To Catch A Predator, in which alleged paedophiles are filmed being lured to a house where they think they are going to meet an under-age girl for sex.

The Letzgo group has posted a series of shaky, hand-held videos of men arriving in public places to meet girls they had been chatting to on social networks and whom they thought were willing to have sex. When challenged by the Letzgo team, the men ran off — while being chased by a vigilante cameraman.

It has emerged this week that two sisters, who have been among the many who have criticised the group on Facebook for their tactics, were subjected to thuggish comments from the group on social networking sites.

One said she feared for the safety of her child after the name of her street was tweeted.

Meanwhile, a man who made negative comments online about the group’s activities said he received a message from a follower that said: ‘I will cut your throat if I see you in the street.’

This controversy puts the spotlight on the legality, morality and motivation of Letzgo Hunting.

In the past, during previous Mail investigations into its leader’s activities, he has asked for money to pay for ‘kit’ for the group. This is despite him having told his local newspaper: ‘I’m not doing it for any kind of monetary gain.’

He also claims to have ‘studied law’, though in reality he has no formal legal qualifications.

What is fascinating is that when he was a teenager, his family was  the subject of a vigilante attack in an apparent case of mistaken identity.

Perhaps this is why the vigilantes’ webpage quoted the ruthless Mongol leader, Genghis Khan, saying: ‘I am the punishment of God. If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you.’

The Letzgo leader — who calls himself ‘Scummbuster’ — was born in the Midlands. His father worked in the car industry and his mother was a shop worker. Tragically, she died two years after his birth.

Jailed: Police say that none of the vigilante group's evidence was used to convict James Stone this week

It was when he was 18 that his father was attacked. He was repeatedly knocked to the ground as three men punched and kicked him. He suffered a smashed up face and serious eye injuries.

The attack happened near a local pub on a Friday night and it was reported that the attackers had accused their victim of having recently assaulted someone.

The Letzgo vigilante’s father, who was 42 at the time, vehemently denied this claim.

He SAID it must have been a case of mistaken identity. Ten years on, it is his son who is the vigilante.

Last year, with his girlfriend, the Letzgo leader set up a security firm, and he is known to be keen on keeping fierce dogs. It has also been alleged that he has taken at least one dog with him when confronting alleged paedophiles.

The man lived in a council property in Leicestershire. Neighbours say he ‘ruined’ a perfectly respectable property by carrying out unnecessary building works and now rents a semi-detached home.

His vigilante work has been marked by a bitter rivalry with another man who also targets paedophiles.

Their respective groups have been engaged in a war of words on Facebook, accusing one another of incompetence.

While the Letzgo leader claims his group includes concerned parents of both sexes, the truth is that it is predominantly run by himself and two other men.

Some may wonder why the police take the group’s videos and related ‘evidence’ seriously. The problem is that the police have a duty to respond to any claim that the law has been broken and must begin to investigate if they believe a crime might have been committed.

One of the vigilante’s neighbours says: ‘What gives this man the right to think he is a latter-day Charles Bronson figure? Such work should be left to the police.’

How bitterly ironic it is that, as soon as the Letzgo leader realised he was going to be exposed, he scuttled off to the police and lawyers — a courtesy he never afforded to the people, such as suicide victim Gary Cleary, that he exposed online.
