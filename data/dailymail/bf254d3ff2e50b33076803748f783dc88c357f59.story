A British man is in a serious condition in hospital after receiving a severe machete wound to the head after he was savagely attacked by a gang of robbers in Cambodia. 

Michael Hay was working as a cashier in a tourist bungalow on the exotic island of Koh Rong, 15 miles off the coast of Sihanoukville, when the gang burst in at 11.30pm on Thursday, lashing out with machetes and clubs. 

The 27-year-old was struck in the head by a long bush knife and also received a blow to the face with a club.

He suffered a fractured cheekbone and an 11cm gash to his head, the Cambodia Daily reports. 

The owner of the Long Beach Bungalow, Jooni Huhani Nleml, 40, from Finland, also received a blow to the head.

Both men were taken to Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh to be treated.

‘Both victims were attacked with knifes to the head and face and were injured seriously,’ Sihanoukville police chief Phul Phorsday said.

‘There were two or three perpetrators and we found knives, batons and rocks at the scene which were used as weapons.’

Provincial police chief Seang Kosal said Mr Hay was working as a cashier at the bungalows - part of a large workforce of foreign backpackers who have descended on Sihanoukville region looking for odd jobs.

But what appeals as a dream working location comes at a price, for the area has become notorious for assaults, robbery and rip-off merchants. 

Interior Minister Sar Khen has already sent a team of high-level police to Sihanoukville to investigate a spate of recent violence - including stabbings, brawls, a drive-by shooting and even explosions - in which foreigners have been victims.

Reports of the attack on Mr Hay and Mr Nleml come in the wake of an extraordinary story that has emerged in Phnom Penh in recent days and which has resulted in intense discussion on the khmer440 ex-patriates’ website.

It revolves around an amazing photo of what are described as ‘two destitute Britons’ who have lost all their money and one of their passports in a hostel robbery in Sihanoukville.

Martin Gates, 24,  and Nicholas Mclernan, 40, they told the Khmer Times in a story that has since been pulled that they lost $US3000 in cash, a laptop computer, two smartphones, bank cards and all their clothes apart from the ones they were wearing.

They told the newspaper that they had managed to make their way to Phnom Penh to ask the British Embassy for help in getting home to the UK, but the Embassy had turned them away.

Writers on the forum have questioned their story, some claiming the photo has been manipulated - which has turned out to be not the case - but asking why it appeared the colours on their T-shirts made it look as though they had taken part in a paint-gun battle.

Some writers believed the pair’s story, while others said it looked like they were on drugs and were pulling a scam.

The debate, which has been running for several days since the photo was first published, includes a recent post that declares that ‘anyone defending these moronic meth-heads needs their own head checked.’
