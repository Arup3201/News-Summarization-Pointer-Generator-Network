Chilling drone footage taken just moments after a massive tornado ripped through Arkansas has revealed the extent of the devastation.

Flattened homes, upturned storage units and scattered cars can be seen on the aerial video, which shows the wreckage just south of Mayflower, Arkansas after a half-mile-wide tornado - just one in a series of deadly storms on Sunday - barreled through Interstate 40 at around 7.30pm.

At least person was killed in the city and the grounded power lines and trees made it hard for emergency services to find stricken areas in the dark, officials said. In the footage,Â rescuers can be seen picking through the debris of one home, and as darkness falls, they are seen continuing their search.

The film was shared on YouTube by storm chaser Brian Emfinger, who wrote that it was 'shot just moments after the tornado moved through'.

'It's extremely 
hazardous here right now,' said Will Elder, an alderman in the city. 'The power lines are down, roads are blocked and they will have to 
proceed with caution.'

The tornadoes
 ripped through the south-central U.S. on Sunday, killing at 
least 18 people in Arkansas and Oklahoma and wiping out entire 
neighborhoods. The small town of Vilonia - about 20 miles from where the video was shot - was particularly badly hit.

The storm was 'at least a half mile wide,' Greg Johnson, an author and storm chaser, told Mashable, adding that it came nearly three years to the day that a tornado killed four people in Vilonia.

'The scene here is incredible,' he said. 'Entire town destroyed and the damage is definitely F5 caliber. Many killed and injured. There are thousands of volunteers and emergency personnel on the ground searching. Entire homes swept off their foundations. Strong brick homes. Complete devastation.'

The Arkansas Department of Emergency Management confirmed early on Monday that at least 16 people had died in the state, while an Oklahoma county sheriff's dispatcher reported that one person had died in the town of Quapaw.

Fox News said another person died in Keokuk County, Iowa.

Searchers
 were continuing to dig through rubble in Vilonia and a spokesman for 
the County Sheriff's office said there was a 'mass casualty situation'.

'An
 entire neighborhood of 50 or so homes has been destroyed. Many homes 
are completely gone except the foundation... There is more devastation 
like this in other parts of Arkansas,' U.S. Representative Tim Griffin 
told Reuters.

Brandon Morris, a 
spokesman for the Arkansas Emergency Management Agency, said Mayflower 
and Vilonia appeared to have been the hardest hit communities, and the National Weather Service in North Little Rock said it was virtually certain that the storm would be rated as the nation's strongest twister to date this year.

'It has the potential to be EF3 or 
greater,' said meteorologist Jeff Hood. EF3 storms have winds greater 
than 136 mph.

'Based on some of the footage we've seen from Mayflower and
 where it crossed Interstate 40, things were wrecked in a very 
significant way.'

The Arkansas National Guard was 
deployed to help out in the state. From communities west of Little Rock 
to others well north of the capital, emergency workers and volunteers 
were going door-to-door checking for victims.

Tornado
 watches - which means twisters could develop but are not an immediate 
threat - are in effect for states as far west as New Mexico and as far 
east as Tennessee and the system produced storms that were moving 
through the region in waves.

More
 than a hundred tornadoes are set to hit the Midwest and the South this 
week as part of a powerful storm system that is impacting on the Midwest
 and the South

Watches were also issued for Kansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, Iowa, Texas and Louisiana. Forecasters warned that areas that 
weren't hit by tornadoes were still at risk of damage from hail and 
powerful straight-line winds.

Sunday
 was the third anniversary of a 122-tornado day, which struck parts of 
Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia and killed 316.

Before this weekend, the country had been experiencing the slowest start to tornado season on record (with no fatalities), likely due to the polar vortex during the winter.
