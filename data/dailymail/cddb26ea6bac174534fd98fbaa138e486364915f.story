A bed and breakfast in Brighton has been crowned the best in the world as a poll revealed Britain has the finest guest houses on the planet.

UK B&Bs took 
the first three places in a league table compiled by TripAdvisor from tourist reviews.

The Twenty One on the seafront in Brighton was named the best - rising from sixth place a year ago.

World's best B&B: The 21 in Brighton, run by Matt Fletcher and Andy Cole, was today named the best in a TripAdvisor league table

Proprietors Matt Fletcher and Andy Cole, who give guests free Tunnock tea cakes, were described by TripAdvisor as 'the perfect hosts', serving 'superb 
breakfasts' and providing 'comfy beds'.

Rooms at the seven-room B&B range from £55 for a single through to £159 for a king-size double with a balcony.

Mr Cole, 47, told The Times: 'Matt and myself are both 100 per cent hands on. We do like to greet every single one of our guests.

'We like to go that little bit further. If one of our guests has a birthday and we find out, we will leave a card for them or a box of chocolates. It gives us as much pleasure to do as guests appreciate it.'

One customer who reviewed the B&B on TripAdvisor wrote: 'Matt and Andy really deserve all the praise they're getting here.

'They 
seem to work non-stop to provide a warm but relaxed welcome in a lovely 
spotless place and are incredibly generous with top quality food and 
drink.'

The guest house knocked last year's winner, the Old Manse in 
Invermoriston, Scotland, took second place this year, with the Riverside
in Ambleside, Cumbria, third.

The UK domination was shown by the fact that six English and two Scottish establishments were in the top 10 B&B world table.

In a list of 25 top UK hotels, there were five Devon establishments in the top 12.

Top UK hotel this year was Charterhouse in Torquay, with visitors speaking of its 'warm and genuine hospitality'.

Second was Hillside Hotel in Ventnor, Isle of Wight, with Rudding Park Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire, third.

Not a single London hotel made it into the UK top 25 last year or the year before. This year, three have managed it - The Milestone Hotel, Hotel 41 and Haymarket Hotel.

TripAdvisor spokeswoman Emma Shaw said: 'These awards celebrate the best hotels in the UK and beyond according to those that really matter - travellers themselves.

'The UK performed extraordinarily well in the B&B category, laying claim to eight of the top 10, while Devon has yet again won over travellers with its impressive hotels.'

She went on: 'Although it's certainly good news to see London in the top UK hotels' list, the highest-ranked hotel from the capital came in at a lukewarm 13th place.'
