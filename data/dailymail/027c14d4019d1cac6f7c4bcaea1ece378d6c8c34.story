Taco terror: Adam Kramer, 28, pulled a large sword on a waitress and threatened death if he didn't get his tacos for free

Adam Kramer, 28, of San Antonio, Texas, was arrested earlier this month after he pulled a sword on a waitress and refused to pay for tacos he ordered, officials said.

Mr Kramer was charged with aggravated robbery for pulling the sword on his server at Alondras De Jalisco, according to an arrest warrant cited by the Houston Chronicle.

He ordered six tacos from a San Antonio restaurant around 2.30pm Dec 2, and then began to unsheathe the sword when told he had to pay, officials said. He said he was instead going to take them for free, according to the affidavit.

The sword-wielding diner left the restaurant by the time a chef came out to talk to him, but then returned to shout death threats while carrying the sword.

‘Mr. Kramer was yelling that he wanted his free tacos or somebody was going to die,’ the affadvit said.

The quick-thinking waitress may have saved at least her own life by locking the door before he reached it, officials said.

He was picked up the next day on a separate charge of assault with a deadly weapon, the Chronicle noted.

This is not the first time Mr Kramer’s been picked up for theft. A MailOnline review of court documents showed him being arrested at least eight times.

He has been charged with petty theft seven times, there are also two drug charges to his name.

He has received only probation for his previous charges but may face jail time in this incident because his latest supervised stint does not expire for two more months.

The thief remains in jail on a $50,000 bond.
