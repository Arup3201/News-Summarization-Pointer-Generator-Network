Refugees taking shelter in Lebanon from violent jihadists have turned around and headed back into war-torn Syria after insurgents launched repeated attacks across the border.

The fleeing victims of the Syrian civil war were seen yesterday at the border town of Arsal, picking through the remains of a refugee camp which Islamist fighters burned to the ground.

Having previously thought of Lebanon as a relatively safe haven from the long-running civil war between Syria dictator Bashar Assad and hard-line Muslim forces in the country, the Syrian victims found themselves in the firing line earlier this week after new attacks.

Today a new wave of Jihadists attacked the village of Kfar Qouq, but were forced back by armed locals.

Some of the fighters are thought to be members of the Islamic State (IS) group, despite their strongholds being hundreds of miles away in the north-east of Syria and parts of Iraq.

Lebanese security sources said the jihadist forces had also been under attack from Syrian government forces that day.

Kfar Qouq is near the Bekaa Valley town of Rashaya, 60 miles south of Arsal, which was seized a week ago by Islamist militants who crossed from Syria. That incursion was the most serious spillover yet of Syria's three-year-long civil war into Lebanon.

Queues: Syrians have loaded everything they can carry onto trucks and into smaller cars for their ride home

Dozens of people were killed in five days of fighting between the army and the militants who included Islamists affiliated to the Islamic State, which has seized territory in Syria and Iraq.

The militants pulled out of Arsal to the mountainous border zone on Thursday, taking with them 19 captive soldiers.

Militant sources said on Friday that they sought to exchange them for Islamists held in Lebanese jails. 

Two commanders close to the group  said the demands had been sent to the Lebanese government and army

Hurt: Injured Syrians are seen inside a van. They hope to be safer inside their own country

The militants withdrew from Arsal into the mountainous border region after a battle in which dozens of people were killed, including 17 soldiers.

The militants said their list of Islamist prisoners they want released included Emad Gomaa, whose arrest last Saturday sparked the incursion into Arsal. The army has said the attack by the Islamists had been long-planned.

Gomaa had been a commander in the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's affiliate in the Syrian civil war, but he switched affiliation to the Islamic State in the weeks before his arrest.

The militants are also seeking the release of other Islamists jailed since a 2007 insurrection by an al Qaeda-inspired group at a Palestinian refugee camp in north Lebanon.

Last month, the Nusra Front issued a statement promising to secure the release of Islamist detainees being held at Roumieh prison, northeast of Beirut.

'This has taken a long time and the government does not seem to be willing to listen or understand. Maybe this time they will,' said the second militant source. 'We have nothing to lose now, we have lost people and our people are refugees again so there is nothing more to lose.'

An army patrol entered Arsal town on Friday for the first time since the militants pulled out, a security source said.
