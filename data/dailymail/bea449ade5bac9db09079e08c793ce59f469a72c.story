Harry Redknapp has distanced QPR from a January transfer window move for Robbie Keane.

Old Redknapp quotes appeared this week after Keane’s exploits for LA Galaxy in the MLS Cup final, and the veteran manager set the record straight on Thursday.

‘We’ve not made an enquiry about him (Keane). He belongs to LA Galaxy, and is the star man of their team and league. They wouldn’t let him go,’ he said.

Even so, Redknapp is an admirer of the 34-year-old Dubliner.

‘Robbie’s an amazing footballer, one of the best pros I’ve come across,’ he said.

Keane, who has a year left on his contract at Galaxy, last had a winter loan spell in the Premier League three years ago, at Aston Villa.

After a busy season at Galaxy, Keane has indicated he will take a breather before weighing up whether a new move might be of benefit.

‘I definitely need to recharge the batteries and see what the next chapter is for me, whether it’s here (Galaxy) or it’s somewhere else,’ said the Republic of Ireland captain.

‘I’m not saying I’m going to leave, but what I’m saying is I need to consider what I want to do, you know? Sometimes change is good for everybody,’ he said.

Meanwhile, Ireland back-up ‘keeper Rob Elliott could be out of action until early February.

With Tim Krul on crutches, Elliott seemed set for a run in the Newcastle United first team until he tore a thigh muscle when playing in the Premier League against Chelsea last Saturday.

‘Rob will be out for six or seven weeks,’ confirmed Newcastle manager Alan Pardew on Thursday.
