President Barack Obama was sworn into his second term on Sunday at noon in front of only his wife and two daughters in a simple service.

His younger daughter Sasha said 'Good job, Daddy!' after he correctly recited the oath of office.

'I did it!' he gleefully responded. Sure to keep him on his toes, he followed that up with a quick 'You didn't mess up!'

Keeping it brief: Mr Obama had his immediate family beside him at the ceremony, but reports also say that his other relatives were also present but out of the camera's line

Close bond: Mr Obama got a happy hug from older daughter Malia and Sasha (right) told him 'Good job, Daddy!' after he completed the oath. 'You didn't mess up!'

The swearing in ceremony took place on Sunday in keeping with the laws states in the Constitution which states that Presidents' terms begin at noon on January 20.

Normally the oath of office is given on the steps of the Capitol and is followed by his address to the nation, but because this year it happens to fall on a Sunday- and inaugurations are never held that day of the week- the oath of office was given quickly in the Blue Room of the White House instead.

Swearing in: President Obama took his oath of office on Sunday just before noon, officially marking the start of his second term

Big moment: The oath was given quickly and held inside the White House because it is Sunday and the inauguration ceremony will be held tomorrow

Keeping it in the family: Mr Obama opted to be sworn in on a Bible that has been in Mrs Obama's family for some time

When President Obama takes the oath again tomorrow in front of the packed Mall, it will be his fourth time doing so.

Michelle Obama showed off her new bangs along with a royal blue dress and cardigan by American designer Reed Krakoff at the swearing-in ceremony.

The First Lady and daughter Malia matched the President's blue suit, also complementing the Blue Room of the White House, where the small ceremony took place. Younger daughter Sasha, however, went her own way: She wore a lacy pink dress with a gold, wide-width, high-waisted belt - a style her mother helped popularize - and gold shoes.

It's not the first time Mrs Obama chose a design by Krakoff. She previously has worn a gown and jacket by the designer, who also is the president and executive creative director of Coach, Inc. She has carried one of his tote bags, too. Her hairdo, however, is a change - and it has been the subject of online chatter since its debut on Thursday in a photo taken at the White House.

Only the President's immediate family and a few relatives were present, along with a crew of journalists to witness and televise the event.

Aside from thanking Chief Justice John Roberts after the oath- and joking with his younger daughter that 'I did it!'- Mr Obama did not make any remarks before heading back out of the Blue Room and back to business.

Mr Roberts, who famously floundered at Mr Obama's 2008 inauguration, carried a piece of paper and read the quick oath without any stumbles this time.

Because he did not recite the oath of office word-for-word in in 2008, Mr Roberts had to perform a second official service inside the White House in the days following.Â 

Though they were not seen on cameras,
a number of his relative were apparently in attendance- including his 
sister and her family, and First Lady Michelle Obama's brother Craig 
Robinson and his family and her mother, Marian, who lives with the 
Obamas in the White House.

Mr
Obama opted to give a nod to Mrs Obama's relatives by choosing to be 
sworn in with his hand resting on the Robinson's family Bible.

Reading it carefully: Chief Justice John Roberts famously floundered when he read the oath of office to Mr Obama in 2008, but he was careful to make no mistakes this time around

Signs of approval: Michelle gives Barack a kiss after he read the oath and Malia gives her dad a big hug

All smiles: Though they looked serious during the actual ceremony, everyone appeared happy after it was done

Few fans: Only a handful of relatives were invited to attend the private ceremony

On their merry way: Justice Roberts follows the First Family after the exit

Watching: The cameramen from the White House Press Pool watched and recorded the oath

Mr Obama attended church with his family
before the ceremony, and laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown 
Solider alongside Vice President Joe Biden, who was also sworn in for 
his second term this morning.

Family was a theme of the morning's ceremony as Mr Biden opted to take his oath of office with his hand over a bible that has been owned by the Biden clan since 1893.

Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor swore 70-year-old Biden into his second term before she rushed off to catch a train to her hometown of New York so that she could attend a book signing.

Second term: Vice President Joe Biden was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor Sunday morning

'An honor': Biden was pleased that Sotomayor pushed back her travel plans in order to perform the oath

Friendly tone: The Vice President took the oath in front of 120 relatives and friends

'I want to explain to you what a wonderful honor it was, and how much out of her way the Justice had to go. She is due in New York. She has to leave right now. So I apologize: We're gonna walk out,' Mr Biden told the crowd after they applauded his oath.

'Her car's waiting so she can catch a train I hope I haven't caused her to miss.'

The Supreme Court Justice smiled before quickly exiting along with the Vice President and his wife Dr Jill Biden.

'And I am leaving - going and gonna meet the President (for) the traditional laying the wreath at 2 over in Arlington. And we're having breakfast. I'll be back, they tell me, in 40 minutes. I hope of some you will still be here,' he said.

Happy moment: Mr Biden was surrounded by family members when he was sworn into office

Tradition: Mr Biden used his family's Bible which they have owned since 1893

The ceremony was held at the U.S. Naval Observatory which doubles as the vice president's residence.

It opened with a prayer by Reverend Kevin O'Brien, a practicing Jesuit priest who is the vice president of Georgetown University's Mission of Campus Ministry.

The selection of Rev. O'Brien comes as little surprise since the Bidens often attend mas at Holy Trinity Catholic Church just one block from the college campus.

After Rev. O'Brien finished his prayer, the attention went to Justice Sotomayor and Mr Biden who repeated the oath after her.

Religious touch: Reverend Kevin O'Brien (right), who is a member of the faculty at Georgetown University, gave a blessing before Mr Biden took the oath of office

Pucker up: Mr Biden kissed one of his grandsons as the rest of the family claps on

Dr Biden, who kept the apparent color-coordination going as she and her husband were wearing varying shades of blue, was in charge of holding the family Bible.

They were surrounded by Mr Biden's children- including Beau and Ashley- and some of their five grandchildren.

Once the oath was said, Mr and Dr. Biden went to meet the President and First Lady at a service at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, though he said that he planned to return to the breakfast with his extended family within the hour.
