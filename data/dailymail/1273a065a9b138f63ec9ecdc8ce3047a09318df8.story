After a backlash from viewers over their 'inane' Diamond Jubilee river pageant broadcast, the BBC provided solemn and sober coverage befitting the gravitas of the Thanksgiving service in St Paul's today.

Huw Edwards anchored the programme and historian Simon Schama provided commentary on a historic day.

The Corporation's coverage of the Thames river pageant was described as 'celebrity-driven drivel' as One Show host Matt Baker came in for heavy criticism.

The former Blue Peter presenter, who appeared alongside Sophie Raworth, was described as 'unprepared, ill-informed and patronising' during the coverage on Sunday afternoon.

But today viewers said on Twitter that the BBC's coverage was much better - and appropriate for such a historic event.

Respected historian Mr Schama provided detailed and in-depth commentary on the historic event as he spoke with Huw Edwards on-screen today.

Fearne Cotton was today blasted for asking singer Paloma Faith about a Diamond Jubilee sick bag in a live interview.

After the BBC were praised for turning their coverage around after Sunday's pageant debacle, the radio presenter quizzed the artist about the bag.

And Miss Faith took the chance on the BBC's Diamond Jubilee programme to shamelessly try and promote her new album.

Twitter user Grace Willis wrote: 'Love the fact that Paloma Faith just used the words 'vom' and 'cotch' on #bbcjubilee'.

And Michael Idato wrote: 'Dear BBC, please find the person who booked Paloma Faith for your #diamondjubilee telecast. And sack them. Immediately.'

Newsreaders Fiona Bruce and Sophie 
Raworth were among the team of reporters covering the church service led
 by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

However, by this afternoon it was all
 beginning to fall apart again as Fearne Cotton asked Paloma Faith about
 Jubilee sick bags in a cringeworthy interview.

Fearne Cotton and the BBC's Formula One presenter Jake Humphrey were also involved in the coverage.

A
 spokesman for the BBC today denied that they had made any changes to 
their presenting line-up in light of the criticism they had received.

Viewer Natalie Watson wrote on 
Twitter: 'At least the BBC have got Huw Edwards doing the commentary 
today - a broadcaster showing the respect and knowledge of the event.'

Stuart Norris, another viewer, Tweeted: 'Huw Edwards is the king of royal broadcasting'.

Matthew Hillman wrote: 'Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce are class acts'.

The praise was in stark contrast to Sunday when Stephen Fry led the criticism and accused the BBC of presenting the most 'mind-numbingly tedious programme in its history'.

Other
 viewers said the show's presenters should have 'shut up' and shown the 
boats rather than cutting to seemingly endless interviews and features.

Expert analysis: Simon Schama who appeared on screen during the coverage today

The
 production team were criticised for cutting away from the flotilla at 
key moments, including the opening of Tower Bridge, after producer Ben 
Weston, 41, was plucked from relative obscurity to lead four days of 
Diamond Jubilee coverage.

Mr Weston said he wanted to bring a 
‘lighter touch’ to the coverage of the River Pageant or as viewers have 
termed it, ‘dumbing down’.

Today he defended Sunday's broadcast in an interview with BBC Radio 5 - and said they wanted to bring the pageant to life.

He said said: 'We did our best on an extraordinarily technically complicated broadcast in abject difficult weather.'

In defending the 
editorial decisions he said he had a choice either to just 'point and 
shoot' the event or 'try and bring it to life'.

He added: 'We 
didn't just want to reflect what was happening on the boats and the 
beautiful sight of the boats, we wanted to reflect all the colour and 
the celebration going on in those parks as well.'

The commentary team were accused of not knowing enough about the 
individual boats. Poor weather caused a number of technical problems 
with the sound cutting out during musical performances.

Overseas broadcasters who received the BBC's footage but added their own commentary criticised the coverage openly on air.

Viewers
 compared presenters such as Radio 1’s Fearne Cotton, Strictly Come 
Dancing star Tess Daly and One Show frontman Matt Baker unfavourably 
against the corporation’s more traditional ‘big event’ presenters, and 
Richard Dimbleby’s memorable commentary on the 1953 Coronation.

The
 legendary broadcaster's son Jonathan Tweeted: 'Dire reaction to BBC 
coverage of another great event. Am asked whether bigwigs have lost the 
plot. Good question to Any Questions.'

Despite the problems, an estimated 10.3million people tuned into the coverage - with viewing figures peaking at 11.9million.

Countless viewers 
took to Twitter to criticise the standard of coverage, with most 
complaints focused on the presenting team, and it became one of the most
 popular topics on the messaging site.

In a series of 
Twitter messages, BBC Two presenter Mr Fry said: ‘HRH The Queen, said the first ignorant presenter. HRH? 

‘But, dear me, this
 is eggier and cheesier than a collapsed souffle. Deeply embarrassing. 
Everyone is telling me that Sky’s coverage is better.

‘Don’t get me wrong peeps, I’m not saying this in relation to ER II’s jubilee - just expected better of the Beeb.’ 

‘It’s because I am an old sentimentalist that I expect better of the nation’s broadcaster.’ 
  Comedian Julian Clary added simply: ‘Please make it stop. #bbcjubilee.'

Tory MP for Reading East, Rob Wilson, joined the voices condemning the BBC's jubilee reporting.

He wrote: 'Seems we all agree on terrible BBC coverage. Low grade, celebrity driven drivel. How did Beeb get it so wrong?'

Another damning 
posting from the politician read: 'Which is worse, the heavy rain 
falling on the flotilla along the Thames or the BBC's dreadful coverage 
of this Royal Jubilee event?'

Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby, summed up the coverage in similarly disparaging terms.

'One hated Thames 
Armada. No Navy left so hordes of tatty boats. Queen freezing, BBC 5Live
 and TV commentary pathetic. A disgrace,' he wrote.
