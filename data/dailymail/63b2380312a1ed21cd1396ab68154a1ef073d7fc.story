A parish vicar drunkenly assaulted his wife after losing their dog then drove off in his Jaguar while he was more than double the alcohol limit, a court has heard.

Former Army chaplain Reverend David Davies attacked his wife of 26 years, Donna, during a row in a park after he got drunk while taking their dog for a walk.

After the incident, the 50-year-old drove to his vicarage home in Torquay, Devon and was still over the limit when police came to his home, a court has heard.

The father-of-two has now been banned from the road for two years and ordered to do 120 hours of unpaid work after admitting common assault and drink driving before Torbay magistrates.

The court heard he also faces losing his job as a clergyman and the vicarage home which comes with the parish position.

Reverend David Davies faces losing his job and home after drunkenly assaulting his wife before driving off

Magistrates heard Davies served as an Army chaplain for more than 20 years before becoming a parish priest.

Last November, he left the home he shares with his wife to take the couple's dog for a walk, but Mrs Davies later received a phone call to say the dog was 'running around unsupervised'.

She went down to Cockington Court park near Torquay to try to find her dog and discovered Davies drunk, the court heard.

Prosecutor Edward Counsell said: 'There was an argument between them. Mrs Davies tried to walk away and was followed by her husband who, according to two witnesses, grabbed her hair and pulled her to the ground.'

After the attack, Davies walked to his car as his wife protested that he was drunk and shouldn't drive.

Police were tipped off by a witness and they went to the vicarage where Davies's car was parked.

The car's engine was still warm and Davies blew a reading of 92mg of alcohol in his breath – more than double the legal limit of 35mg.

He was arrested and in police interview he 'admitted pulling his wife to the ground' and accepted he had been drink driving, said Mr Counsell.

Alan Parsons, defending, told the court Davies had been married for 26 years and had two grown-up sons.

He said Mrs Davies did not report the assault but her husband admitted there had been an attack in interview.

Mr Parsons said: 'The consequences for Rev Davies over what has been happening in the last year and especially as a result of these convictions, are quite monumental.

'He has been suspended by the Diocese of Exeter but the indications given to his wife is that he will not be allowed to continue.'

He said that means they will also lose their vicarage home which was tied in with his job as priest of Cockington and Torre in Torquay.

Mr Parsons handed in a letter from the vicar's wife as well as his Army service record.

He told the court: 'He has a lot of issues and a difficult path ahead.'

Davies admitted common assault and drink driving in November – six weeks after he was suspended from his duties at the end of September.

The Diocese of Exeter said at the time of the offences that they 'were very grieved when the police informed us of the charges against him'.

Davies, who left court without commenting, may struggle to obtain benefits due to his conduct, said Mr Parsons, who added that his wife earned £800-a-month working part time.

The magistrates banned him from driving for 24 months and gave him a 12-month community order with certain conditions including doing 120 hours of unpaid work in the next year, and pay £145 costs.
