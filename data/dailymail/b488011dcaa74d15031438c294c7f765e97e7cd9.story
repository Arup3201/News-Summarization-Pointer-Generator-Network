An almighty row broke out in Naples when a church procession was stopped in its tracks by a driver's calamitous attempts at a three-point turn.

There were plenty of raised voices and wild hand gestures as the clumsy motorist struggled to turn his white Fiat around in the narrow street in the southern Italian city.

Video footage of the incident shows a priest opening his arms wide and looking to the heavens with delight when the car finally wriggles out of the tight spot.

Praise the Lord: A priest and fellow onlookers are delighted when the car finally gets on its way

Easy does it: The driver begins his u-turn while the road is clear, unaware of the trouble he is about to cause

The vehicle blocked dozens of road-users and pedestrians and by the end had drawn a large crowd of onlookers intrigued by the commotion.Â 

Some got angry and shouted at the motorist, while others laughed at his expense and took pictures.

But a few also got involved by trying to help the man and his passenger out. They included a police officer and traffic officals.

The driver had started off by blocking two cars heading in opposite directions along what had been as a quiet road.

But the car became trapped in a sideways position between two parked vehicles while he attempted the painfully slow turn.

as horns began sounding, the tailback grew with the arrival of a group
of motorcyclists, who were forced to dismount and lend a helping hand.

The motorist's embarrassment was confounded when the church procession appeared but was unable to pass the blockage.

Passing
pedestrians also stopped and stared, while residents living in neighbouring houses 
emerged onto their balconies to see what all the fuss about.

Applause and chants of 'Bravo' broke out
when the driver finally completed the u-turn and was able to continue his delayed journey.

Laughing stock: Other motorists laugh at the driver's expense and some even take pictures
