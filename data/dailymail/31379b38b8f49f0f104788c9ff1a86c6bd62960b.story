A 17-year-old cheerleader who 'always had a smile on her face' has died from an inoperable brain tumor - one year after she was given the devastating diagnosis.

Nina Poeta, a senior at Seymour High School in Connecticut, went to the doctors in November 2013 after suffering severe headaches while performing her routines.

She was referred for an MRI scan at Yale New Haven Hospital, during which medics discovered a cancerous mass on her brain. Because of the tumor's location, it could not be surgically removed.

For the following year, Miss Poeta, also a gymnast, underwent dozens of rounds of radiation while incredibly keeping up her cheerleading career at the school in Botsford Road, Seymour.

But now, after a 'strong' battle with her cancer, she has passed away at home, surrounded by her mother, Dorie, father, John, and sister, Cara, according to WTNH.com.

On a Facebook page set up to track the teenager's progress, dubbed 'Poeta Strong', a close family friend wrote: 'It is with broken hearts that we share the news of Nina's passing.

'Nina was at home surrounded by her mom and dad and her sister, Cara. It was a calm and peaceful moment at 11pm on November 1st, All Saints' Day.

During Miss Poeta's illness, an online fundraiser was started to help her family pay for her medical bills. Donors from both her town and further afield helped to raise more than $40,000 in total. 

Jim Freund, principal of Seymour High School, said the entire community had  come together in an 'impressive' attempt to support Miss Poeta, who 'fought strong through her battle with cancer'.

But despite donors' efforts, the teenager's illness eventually took its toll. She became confined to a wheelchair and lost the ability speak shortly before hear death last Saturday night.

In late October, Miss Poet's family received a new handicapped accessible van, courtesy of Harte Family Motors. 'I’m at a loss for words,' Mr Poeta told the New Haven Register at the time.

And in September, the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Connecticut, paid for the teenager, her mother and her sister to go on a nine-day trip to Italy.

Rich Kearns, the Director of Security of Seymour Connecticut Public Schools, today paid tribute to the 'awesome' girl, saying: 'She always had a smile on her face even through this whole battle.'

He added: 'Back in November when she was diagnosed with this brain tumor she continued to come to school and participate in cheerleading.

'She actually was a key part of that success for that cheerleading team where they won the state championship.' 

Mr Kearns said grief counselors are currently on hand at the school to help students and staff deal with the tragic loss of one of their own, according to Eyewitness News.
