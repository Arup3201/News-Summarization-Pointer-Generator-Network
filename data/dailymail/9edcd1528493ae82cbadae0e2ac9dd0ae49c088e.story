Breast cancer is often thought to affect only women, but a husband and wife each diagnosed with the disease have been fighting it together.

Gerard Campion, 63, of Clinton, Connecticut, was diagnosed with male breast cancer after discovering a blister on his chest in 2006 - sadly the cancer had already spread to three lymph nodes. 

'I remember thinking, he's not supposed to have this. I am,' his wife, Meg Campion, told the Today show, recalling the devastating diagnosis that came three years before she faced her own battle with breast cancer.

Fortunately, she caught the disease at an early stage.

'Everything was in sight, meaning it had not traveled to any lymph nodes,' said Mrs Campion, who was pronounced cancer-free after a lumpectomy and radiation.

After undergoing surgery to have his right breast removed, followed by four chemotherapy treatments, Mr Campion was also declared free of the disease.

But in 2011, the father-of-two and grandfather was diagnosed with recurrent breast cancer and learned that the disease had spread to his spine, ribs and hips.

'The cancer's at some point going to get me. And it's going to take a while to get me because I ain't gonna let it get there,' said Mr Campion, who was told by doctors that his cancer was manageable but not curable.

Last year, he told the New Haven Register that his condition had stabilized after two rounds of radiation and hormone treatment. 

Determined: 'The cancer's at some point going to get me. And it's going to take a while to get me because I ain't gonna let it get there,' said Mr Campion, pictured with Meg (left) at the wedding of his daughter Chelsea (second from right)

In August 2013, he was able to play 62 holes of golf to celebrate his 62nd birthday, and raised thousands of dollars for Closer to Free, a joint effort of the Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital.

'I have this opportunity to talk about it, to hopefully alleviate fears that people have, to talk about men, to get them to watch themselves,' he said.

Important cause: Mr Campion, pictured with daughters Chelsea (left) and Kate (right) has worked to raise awareness for male breast cancer, which accounts for less than oneper cent of all breast cancer cases

According to the National Cancer Institute, male breast cancer accounts for less than oneper cent of all breast cancer cases.

The disease may develop at any age but most often affects men between 60 and 70.
