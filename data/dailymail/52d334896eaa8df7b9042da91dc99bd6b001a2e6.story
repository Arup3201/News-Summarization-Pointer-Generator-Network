England have been coming to terms with the ‘big loss’ of Owen Farrell for their entire RBS Six Nations campaign and bracing themselves for further upheaval, with Brad Barritt destined to be ruled out of the opener, at least.

The RFU confirmed on Tuesday that the most experienced fly-half in the squad had sustained a ‘high-grade’ medial ligament strain in his left knee during Saracens’ European Champions Cup defeat at Clermont Auvergne and would miss the championship campaign.

That bleak bulletin was accompanied by updates on the state of other frontline casualties, including his clubmate Barritt, who was on course to start at inside centre against Wales in Cardiff a week on Friday.

Instead, the man whose bloody, selfless heroism underpinned the victory over Australia at the end of November is almost certain to be counted out of that explosive fixture at the Millennium Stadium, having also strained a knee ligament in France on Sunday.

The upshot is that England find themselves with an alarming dearth of fit and firing centres as they prepare to face an onslaught from the Welsh midfield Lions, Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies.

Manu Tuilagi has already all but counted himself out of the whole tournament because of his persisting groin injury, while Luther Burrell suffered concussion during Northampton’s loss to Racing Metro on Saturday and will be monitored for the remainder of this week. His hopes of being available to play in Cardiff are in the balance.

Meanwhile, Bath’s Kyle Eastmond went off with another ‘stinger’ blow to his left shoulder — his second in successive matches — early in the West Country club’s win over Glasgow, so he is also in doubt.

The England management have been assailed by bad news and uncertainty at just the wrong time. Ben Morgan’s broken leg has robbed them of the leading performer in the autumn series, while leading locks Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury are both absent — the latter for the whole championship. There have been further disruptions to the pack, with Tom Wood nursing a sprained ankle and Geoff Parling ruled out with a knee injury.

After having a scan, Wood tweeted on Tuesday night: ‘Aside from the obvious bruising/swelling, the scan revealed some potential issues. I’m not ruling myself out just yet.’

In total, 12 England players who would be considered for selection are likely to be unavailable, but the biggest concerns, without question, are in midfield. At present, England have only two fully-fit centres — Billy Twelvetrees and Jonathan Joseph. They may have to settle for a selection that ignores form, with fitness being the deciding factor. Burrell has been outstanding for Northampton this season, but he has had a dip in recent weeks.

Twelvetrees, meanwhile, has been unconvincing for Gloucester, with frequent lapses in concentration and execution undermining his undoubted all-round class.

Whatever the misgivings, there is every chance that the combination, which featured in all five games in last year’s tournament, will be reunited next week.

The loss of Farrell is of symbolic concern for England as he is an established leader in the squad whose mental strength and goal-kicking quality make him a reassuring presence when the fur is flying. He would have been the replacement fly-half in Cardiff, deputising for George Ford, but instead that role will be a two-way tussle. 

England head coach Stuart Lancaster is having to contend with a host of injury headaches

Unless Stuart Lancaster chooses not to put a specialist No 10 on the bench, which is unlikely but not unthinkable, Stephen Myler and Danny Cipriani will go head to head to claim that place.

The exploits of Cipriani since joining Sale were acclaimed yesterday by Nick Easter, the recalled Harlequins No 8, who played with him when the newcomer ran Ireland ragged at Twickenham.

‘One of the most enjoyable games I played with England was with him at 10 versus Ireland in 2008,’ said Easter. ‘He suffered a bad ankle injury after his golden year, but he has knuckled down. He looks to me to be more of a complete player now, with less of the showman stuff that he had in him. Now it’s more about, “Right, how do we get over the gain-line and get into good positions?”’

Easter acknowledged Farrell’s absence would be keenly felt, saying: ‘He is one of the key leaders; a driving force of the attack and the gameplan. He has clearly proved his status on the international stage and will be a big loss.’

However, Easter is convinced England can cope with the injuries which have drastically undermined their preparations, adding: ‘The strength in depth in rugby in this country is fantastic. We’re equipped to deal with that. We are very confident.’

Easter has profited from the broken leg suffered by Morgan to end his three-and-a-half year international exile.

Billy Vunipola is higher in the No 8 pecking order but Easter said: ‘The intensity and training will step up over the next week and that’s a chance for me to show what I’m about. But I don’t want to be holding tackle bags. I want to get selected and show what I can do in a white shirt again.
