Three lions and a crocodile have come claw to jaw in a show of wildlife at its fiercest in Kenya.

Fascinating footage posted on YouTube from a family's visit to Samburu National Reserve shows a lioness tentatively squaring up to a large croc in shallow water.

The lioness sticks out her paw but as the croc begins to stir and thrash around, snapping its dangerous jaw, two more lionesses arrive on the scene to help out their friend.

'We knew it was something special when our guide's mouth dropped open as soon as the lions jumped onto the crocodile. Take a look!,' Kai Banks wrote on YouTube when he published the video on Monday.
