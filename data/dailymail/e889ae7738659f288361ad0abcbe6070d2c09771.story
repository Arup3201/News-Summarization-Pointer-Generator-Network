Arriving at court in business suits and weighed down with heavy bags, the wealthy parents of a ‘brash, flash, boastful and spoilt’ murderer were clearly expecting the worst.

And when they appeared in the dock to be sentenced for attempting to cover up their son’s crime, their deepest fears were confirmed.

Leigh and Anita Turner were each jailed for 27 months and condemned for their lack of remorse after their son Elliot, 20, strangled his 17-year-old girlfriend at their home.

They had destroyed their son’s letter of confession written after he had killed aspiring model Emily Longley in a fit of jealous rage in his bedroom.

Sentencing the couple at Winchester Crown Court yesterday, Mrs Justice Dobbs criticised them for the effect their crime will have on their younger son, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

She said: ‘I appreciate it must be very difficult for a parent when faced with the situation you found yourself in, but you knew what you did was wrong and against the law.

‘You gave no thought to the consequences for your youngest son and now he is going to be without his parents for an important part of his development.’

Elliot Turner – who was described as ‘brash, flash, boastful and spoilt’ by his own lawyer – was sentenced to life for murder in May.

The former public schoolboy choked Emily after seeing pictures of her posing with two topless men for a modelling assignment.

He pushed her head so hard into a pillow he left it with a ‘face mask’ indentation.

When Turner’s parents woke the next morning they found their son – who was obsessed by gangsters – had packed his bags ready to flee to Spain. But former jeweller Mr Turner, 54, and his Indonesian-born wife Anita, 51, convinced him to stay and concocted a story claiming Emily had died in her sleep.

It was only after police bugged their home in Bournemouth that the Turners were heard talking about destroying the letter of confession with bleach.

The court heard how Mrs Turner had held ‘Support Elliot’ parties for her son while detectives were still investigating the death at their home in May last year.

During more than 291 hours of covert recordings, Elliot Turner was heard discussing the night of the murder with his parents and claiming that he had ‘just lost it’.

Police scans of a computer seized from their home found Google searches for ‘death by strangulation’ and ‘how to get out of being charged for murder’.

On the recordings, Mr Turner is heard asking his wife if she thought they were right to destroy the letter, saying: ‘We’ve perverted the course of justice, we’ve destroyed the vital evidence in this case.’ Mrs Turner is heard to reply: ‘Yes because he is our son, we’ve done the right thing.’

Mr Turner is later heard telling his wife: ‘Stop denying it. He ****ing strangled her.’

Emily's parents Caroline and Mark. Caroline said that Turner saw Emily as 'a trophy adorned on his arm'

'That light has been extinguished suddenly and needlessly by you.

Fern Russell, representing Mrs Turner, said: ‘She is a mother who couldn’t accept that her son had committed the worst imaginable crime and it was in that turmoil that she carried out that act.

‘In her mind she wasn’t concealing a murder but at worst was buying time for her son to explain himself.’

But in her sentencing Mrs Justice Dobbs said: ‘The destruction of a confession to a killing is a very serious matter indeed.

‘Despite the strength of evidence against you, the two of you chose to fight the case showing little remorse for what you had done.’

Speaking outside court, Emily’s grandfather, Ron Longley, said: ‘We are satisfied with the sentence, we feel it was balanced and just. A year ago, Mr and Mrs Turner’s son murdered our lovely, shining Emily.’

When asked if he believed his family had received justice, Mr Longley added: ‘In law certainly. Morally, in terms of life, we can’t feel that anything has been made fair.’
