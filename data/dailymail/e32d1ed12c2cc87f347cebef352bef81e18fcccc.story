West Brom striker Saido Berahino is set to appear in court on charges of drink-driving.

The 21-year-old was arrested by police in October after being stopped in the early hours of one morning on the M6.

On Monday it was revealed that Berahinoâ€™s bail had been cancelled and that he will appear before magistrates later this month after being summonsed.

The England Under 21 international has been in prolific form for the Baggies this season, netting 13 times in 24 appearances for the club this season.

The forward scored four goals on Saturday as new boss Tony Pulis saw his side romp to a 7-0 home win against non-league Gateshead in the third round of the FA Cup.

Despite his goalscoring form, Berahino has occurred problems off-the-pitch at West Brom with Sportsmail revealing that the Burundi-born star has been fined by the club for reporting late on match days three times this campaign.
