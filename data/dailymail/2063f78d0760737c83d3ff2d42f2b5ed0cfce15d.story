The world's largest underground trampoline was unveiled today in caverns which are twice the size of St Paul's Cathedral.

Bounce Below is part of Zip World, an outdoor pursuits centre in Blaenau Ffestiniog, North Wales. As part of their latest attraction, staff have transformed a slate cavern by installing three giant trampolines.

The trampolines are reached by train, with each linked by a 60ft long slide. It is thought to be the first facility of its kind, with the trampolines open to the public from July 3.

Huge suspended trampolines are to become a new tourist attraction in Llechwedd Slate Caverns, Gwynedd, Wales when they open later this summer

Visitors will be able to enjoy a light show while they bounce on the huge trampolines, linked by a 60ft slide which spirals down to the underground space

The colourfully-lit caverns are the latest attraction at the regeneration project, which has seen more than Â£1 million invested in it so far.

Sean Taylor, owner of Zip World, said: 'We got the idea when my business partner saw this done in woods in France but this has never been done in a cavern, this really is a world first in Wales.

'It's a one hour activity where customers get dressed up in a cotton overall and given a helmet, they then jump on a train and travel inside the mountain.

'There are three giant trampolines with three metre net walls to stop people climbing out. Each is linked by a slide to go down and a walkway to go up - the biggest slide is 60ft.'

Workers preparing the attraction had to work using portable lamps and carried out around 500 tons of rubble from the cavern.

Business development manager Laura Jones told The Daily Post: 'The first trampoline is 20ft off the ground, the second is 60ft and the third is 180ft high. They are connected by shoots and you get in via a walk way in to the middle trampoline.

'Each trampoline is about 60ft wide. They've been tested to hold a huge weight.'

The huge play-area, expected to be a massive hit with kids, is built into an underground vault which is twice the size of St Paul's Cathedral

Visitors will be given a helmet and a protective overall before they travel down to the site in a specially-built train, organisers have said

The slate seams in north Wales, formed by compacted clay more than 300 million years ago, are some of the highest quality in the world, leading the material to be dubbed 'black gold' by locals.

The mining of the slate dates back to Roman times, but the industry took off at the end of the 18th century and into the 19th century, when some mines employed more than 3,000 people.

The government abolished slate duty in 1831 leading to rapid expansion and the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates.

Slate production in Wales peaked at over half a million tons in 1898, with 17,000 men employed in the industry.

The slate was mainly used for housing, but has also been used for flooring, worktops and headstones.

Conditions in the mines were said to be very poor, with low wages and poor levels of safety. Workers provided their own medical assistance by setting up their own St John Ambulance station underground.

The miners went on strike in 1900 and the three-year dispute partly led to the slate mining industry moving abroad, first to Spain and then to the rest of the world.

The First and Second World Wars also saw a great reduction in the number of men employed in the industry and the introduction of other roofing materials in the post-war years killed off many of the larger mines.

Some of the slate mines were used to store precious works of art during German bombing raids in the Second World War (pictured right) and the caverns are also said to be fall out shelters for the Royal Family in the event of nuclear war.
