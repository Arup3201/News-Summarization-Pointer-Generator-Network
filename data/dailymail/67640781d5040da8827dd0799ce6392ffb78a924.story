Despite regular changes to the New Tricks cast, viewers have always been able to rely on the familiar presence of Dennis Waterman.

But now the 66-year-old has revealed that he too is leaving the hit BBC One drama, and will appear in only the first two episodes of the next series because he ‘misses the old team’.

The original cast, when the programme began in 2003, featured Alun Armstrong, James Bolam and Amanda Redman, but over the years they have been replaced by Denis Lawson, Nicholas Lyndhurst and Tamzin Outhwaite.

Waterman’s spokesman said yesterday: ‘Dennis has decided to quit New Tricks. There are another ten episodes [for series 12] that they are going to start filming in November and he will be in two of them.

‘Dennis misses the old crew, the original line-up. The chemistry between them on the set was remarkable.’ He added that there had been ‘no big falling out’ – simply that the old team had worked together for a long time.

‘All of the other leading cast members decided the time was right for them to leave one by one, and now Dennis has decided it is his time.’

Bolam quit in 2012 saying the show had gone stale, while Redman left in 2013 claiming that filming took too long.

It is not known who will replace Waterman, who also sings the programme’s theme.
