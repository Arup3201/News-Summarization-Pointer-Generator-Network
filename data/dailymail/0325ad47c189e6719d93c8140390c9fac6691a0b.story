Forget the traditional Easter egg hunt. This year, it seems we’re hunting for the sun instead.

Nearly two million Britons are preparing to fly away to escape the Arctic chill this Bank Holiday – up around 30 per cent on a typical Easter weekend.

There has been a rush for last-minute holiday and short-break deals to beat the cold snap, which forecasters say will be with us until May and will send temperatures plunging to -6C this week.

Forecasters expected this to be the coldest March in the UK for 51 years, with the Met Office saying from March 1 to 26, the UK mean temperature was 2.5C, which is 3C below the long-term average.

Holidaymakers received a boost this 
morning when a planned 24-hour strike by French port control officers 
was called off, allowing ferries to run as normal.

French port control officers had been
due to go on a stoppage that would have hit ports such as 
Calais, Dieppe and Cherbourg.

The
Met Office said this March was likely to be the fourth coldest on 
record for England, joint third coldest for Wales, joint eighth coldest 
for Scotland and sixth coldest for Northern Ireland.

This March joined 2006, 2001, 1995, 1987, 1979, 1970 and 1962 as years when the month saw some significant snowfall.

The coldest March in the UK was in 1962, at 1.9C, followed by 1947, 2.2C, 1937, 2.4C , and 1916 and 1917, 2.5C.

The cold weather is expected to continue through the Easter weekend and into April.

P&O Ferries had warned its 
passengers to expect long delays today and on Good Friday and there were
fears of traffic build-ups on routes to the port of Dover in Kent.

However at 2am the strike was called 
off after successful late-night talks in France.

'This is excellent news
for British holidaymakers,' said P&O Ferries spokesman Chris 
Laming.

But those staying at
home will have to contend with problems on the roads and railways, with
the RAC expecting more than seven million motorists to be gearing up 
for an Easter break.

There
will be disruption on the roads as freezing weather, jams and roadworks
take their toll, while on the railways thousands of passengers face 
delays and replacement buses due to engineering works.

Among the worst is the partial closure of Reading station, causing diversions and delays between London and the West Country.

The Association of British Travel Agents said 1.7million Britons will get away from the continuing cold by holidaying abroad this Easter.

A £5 million-plus rescue package will be offered to farmers who have lost livestock in the severe blizzards that have hit Northern Ireland, Stormont ministers have agreed.

Affected farmers will be eligible for hardship payments from a pot of emergency funding while the power-sharing Executive has also agreed to pick up the tab for disposing of the thousands of animals killed in the huge snow drifts that have enveloped parts of the region.

Many have snapped up last-minute offers to escape some of the coldest March conditions on record, heading for sunny spots such as the Canary Islands, Majorca, Tunisia, Egypt and Turkey.

Top city break choices are Paris, Dublin, Amsterdam, Rome and New York, an ABTA spokesman said, while France and Austria are the most-popular ski destinations.

Heathrow will handle 1.2million 
passengers between now and Tuesday and 3.6million over the two-week 
school break to April 14. Today will be the busiest day, with 116,000 
heading to the sun or the ski slopes.

Some 98,000 passengers are due to take
off with British Airways tomorrow alone. Gatwick airport listed 
Barcelona, Geneva and the southern Spanish city of Malaga as its top 
destinations.

Accommodation booking website hotels.com reported huge 
rises in Britons searching for trips to Corfu and Rhodes. Other popular 
spots include Orlando in Florida, Agadir in Morocco, and Mexico City and
Cancun in Mexico.

ABTA chiefs added that from now until Tuesday, a total of 214,000 will fly from Gatwick, 110,000 from Manchester, 110,000 from Stansted and 55,000 from Luton. Scottish airports will also see more than 100,000 departures.

Chief executive Mark Tanzer said: ‘After two wet summers and no end in sight to the winter, many Brits are desperate for some sunshine. We’ve seen a surge in last minute bookings to warm destinations.’

For those staying in the UK, around 
one in 17 still plan to have a break, with at least one overnight stay 
away from home over the Easter. These trips will generate £600million 
for the UK economy, according to national tourism agency VisitEngland.

Motoring
groups said the seven million drivers set to take to their cars over 
Easter faced jams and roadworks, as well as the bad weather. The RAC is 
increasing its patrol hours by 10 per cent during the four days of ‘road
rush’ which begin on Good Friday.

Traffic
information company Inrix said drivers heading to and from north-west 
England and the West Country will face the longest delays, while the 
Highways Agency warned that motorists have to contend with 26 sets of 
roadworks covering 145 miles around the country.
