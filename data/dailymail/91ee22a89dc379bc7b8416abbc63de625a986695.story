Young British soldiers who have had combat experience are more likely to commit violent crimes when they return home from the armed forces.

Of around 3,000 military men under the age of 30, more than a fifth had a conviction for violent offences, compared with 6.7 per cent of their peers who are not in the army.

There were strong links between combat experience with post-deployment alcohol misuse, traumatic stress and violence.

Men who had seen combat in Iraq and Afghanistan were 53 per cent more likely to commit a violent offence than comrades given non-combat roles.

Those with multiple experiences of combat had a 70 per cent to 80 per cent greater risk of committing acts of violence.

In the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken, researchers were given access to police records on almost 14,000 randomly selected men and women who were active or former members of the armed forces, mostly the Army.

Participants provided information about their experiences before and after joining the military and underwent psychological tests.

A search of the Police National Computer was made for any convictions, cautions or warnings relating to the study population.

Overall, 17 per cent of the men had criminal records, and 11 per cent had committed violent offences.

Of the 2,728 aged 30 and younger, 20.6 per cent had a criminal record for violence.

The findings, released on the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War, are published in a special issue of The Lancet medical journal.

Study leader Dr Deirdre MacManus, from King's College London, said: ‘There has been a lot of media coverage and public debate about violence committed by veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

‘Our study, which used official criminal records, found that violent offending was most common among young men from the lower ranks of the Army and was strongly associated with a history of violent offending before joining the military.

‘Serving in a combat role and traumatic experiences on deployment also increased the risk of violent behaviour.’

Violent offences covered a broad range of acts, from verbal harassment to homicide. They did not include incidents of domestic violence.

A strong association was seen between violent offending and high levels of self-reported aggression.

Professor Sir Simon Wessely, co-director of the Centre for Military Health Research at King's College London, who co-authored the study, admitted that an aggressive streak can be useful in a soldier.

‘Some people with aggressive dispositions make very good soldiers, that's the nature of the game,’ he told a press conference in London.

He added: ‘My own view, and the view of many people in this area, is that you meet a lot of people in the armed forces who you're glad are in the armed forces, and it's doing them a lot of good.’

But he stressed that the vast majority of soldiers returning from tours of duty in combat zones never got into trouble.

‘Not every single person who joins the armed forces is Sir Lancelot or Sir Galahad,’ said the professor.

‘We are suggesting there is a problem that needs to be looked at, but just as with post traumatic stress disorder this is not a common outcome in military populations. Overall you must remember that of those who serve in combat, 94 per cent of who come back will not offend.’

Screening within the armed forces to identify at-risk individuals would not work, he argued. For every correct prediction there were likely to be five that were wrong.

However he said his group had started conducting random mental health checks on several thousand members of the armed forces returning from active duty. In the US, this is a routine procedure.

Commenting on the report, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘We are committed to supporting members of our Armed Forces and their families as they return to civilian life post deployment.

‘That is why we funded this research and have comprehensive mental health support available before, during and after operations. We also ensure that all personnel go through a thorough period of decompression to help make this adjustment.

‘This report recognises that the vast majority of service personnel make this adjustment successfully and are not more likely to commit a violent offence post deployment - there is only an increased risk of 2 per cent when compared to the general population.

‘However, any violent offence is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by our Armed Forces. If a member of our Armed Forces or their family experiences violence there is a wide range of support and help available to them.’

Aaron Wilkinson, 24, shot his landlady Judith Garnett with a shotgun at point-blank range when he returned from Afghanistan.

But he was convicted with manslaughter rather than murder because he was suffering with post traumatic stress disorder at the time of the killing.

The court was told Wilkinson had been badly affected by seeing three Afghan soldiers blown up by a Taliban bomb.

Aaron Wilkinson was convicted of manslaughter after shooting his landlady while suffering from PTSD

On his return from Afghanistan Wilkinson worked on a game 
farm run by mother-of-two Mrs Garnett.

Judith Garnett had taken in Aaron Wilkinson and treated him like a member of her own family

Wilkinson worked for her and lived at her home in Woodlesford, 
near Leeds. She had taken him in a decade earlier when he was homeless 
after being thrown out by his mother, and treated him like a member of 
the family.

After his tour in 2010 Wilkinson talked constantly about his time 
in Afghanistan with the Welsh Regiment, wore combat clothing and held 
a shotgun as if he was carrying an Army rifle.

He even carried a piece of shrapnel in a jar that had been pulled out of his thigh after a mortar attack.

When Mrs Garnett ordered him to leave in January 2011, he snapped and killed her with three blasts from a shotgun.

He then dialled 999 and told the operator: ‘I have done something absolutely terrible...  I just had a moment of madness.’

The court heard the combination of Asperger’s and PTSD left him unlikely to be able to exercise self-control.

Colleague Mark McCabe said during his service Wilkinson 
often built a campfire on his own away from other troops. On one 
occasion he heard Wilkinson laughing and discovered he had skewered a 
cat with a red-hot poker.

He was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to his PTSD and Asperger's syndrome.
