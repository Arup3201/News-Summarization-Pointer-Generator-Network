Australian schoolies in Bali are being warned that they are at risk, with Balinese nightclubs and bars targeting teen by selling a potentially lethal alcohol at bargain prices.

Nightclubs in Kuta and Seminyak are serving dangerous alcohol 'arak' at extremely low prices, despite the fact the alcohol has been know to poison consumers in the past, leading to blindness, organ failure and death. 

One bar has a deal for '20 shots for under $15' and Red Bull and Vodka drinks for $1.50, according to The Daily Telegraph. 

But travellers are being warned not to be tempted by these deals, to avoid drinking spirits and to stick to bottled beverages for the sake of their safety.

About 6,000 Australians are expected to head to Bali in the next three weeks for schoolies celebrations

Australian casualties have been amongst the deaths and injuries that have occurred due to methanol poisoning in Indonesia. Perth rugby player Michael Denton, left, died after drinking a cocktail in 2011 and and teenager Liam Davies, right, died of suspected methanol poisoning on New Year's Day 2013.

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Medical Association warn against the consumption of arak.

Not only can it contain up to 50% alcohol, if arak is incorrectly brewed methanol is often created, resulting in a potentially deadly liquid. 

Australian casualties have been amongst the deaths and injuries that have occurred due to methanol poisoning in Indonesia. 

Perth teenager Liam Davies, 19, died in Indonesia of suspected methanol poisoning on New Year's Day 2013.  

In 2011, Perth rugby player Michael Denton died of methanol poisoning after drinking a cocktail. 

In two separate occasions in December 2013, Central Coast teen Jasmine Baker, 17, and Perth teen Tess Mettam, 19, both went temporarily blind after drinking cocktails in Bali, again due to methanol poisoning. 

Red Frogs Australia Bali co-ordinator Paul Mergard said the organisation had dealt with seven suspected cases of methanol poisoning in Bali last year.

The substance is mixed in with drinks to be a cheaper alternative to drinkable alcohol like vodka.

'If a price of drink is too good to be true then it probably is,' Mr Mergard said.

'Think about where you’re drinking and what you're drinking.

'Last year we had to airlift one girl to Darwin because she had been poisoned.'

In 2009, 29 people died of suspected methanol poisoning in Lombok and surrounding Indonesian islands. 

Major pitfalls graduates should avoid are methanol poisoning and taking illegal drugs, like hallucinogenic mushrooms

School leavers travelling in Bali are warned that the locally-made alcohol, which is frequently brewed in private homes, is extremely strong, leading to a multitude of increased risks. 

It's advised that travellers avoid spirits and drink bottled beverages, so they are able to ascertain the strength of the drink and where it was made. 

With 6,000 Australians expected to land on the shores of party island Bali in the next three weeks, a schoolies support group is warning graduates to take more precautions as the risks of running into trouble overseas is higher than at home. 

Thirty-four volunteers from Red Frogs Australia will be stationed at up to 20 hotels across Kuta, Legian and Seminyak to help reduce these risks.

They will be helping school leavers avoid the pitfalls of schoolies in Bali, which include methanol poisoning and taking illegal drugs, like hallucinogenic mushrooms. 

Bali co-ordinator Paul Mergard said Red Frogs decided to set up at the popular holiday destination three years ago when the numbers of school leavers heading to the island increased.

There will also be volunteers stationed in Fiji. 

Mr Mergard said the risks of young people running into trouble in Bali was higher than it was for those who opted to stay in Australia for celebrations.

'There is a phenomena that happens in Australians who get on a six-hour flight to Bali where they lose... their common sense,' Mr Mergard told Daily Mail Australia.

'Aussies who get to Bali would do things here they would never do at home, like hire a motorbike without a licence... and they wonder why they get into accidents. 

'Traffic gridlock makes getting medical services more challenging.'

Last year, Red Frogs Australia dealt with seven cases of suspected methanol poisoning. The substance is used as an alcohol substitute

Mr Mergard said he and the volunteers had seen the 'horrific' effects drugs and alcohol had on people who decided to party too hard.

'A lot of the kids are here to have a good time, but you obviously see a lot of kids intoxicated and have tried mushrooms. 

'They're hallucinogenic... people think they can fly and all that sort of stuff, and you can seriously injure yourself. 

'They can have significant and long-lasting effects, and people also get violent, aggressive and paranoid.

'Mushrooms have been made illegal in Bali and the penalties could be severe.

'Methanol poisoning is a problem in Bali as well.'  

Fighting was also another issue and Mr Mergard warned people to behave themselves as a lot of toolies came to Bali and try to pick fights.

'Schoolies need to be aware of that and not to make comments about people's girlfriends... as there are boys who are pumped up and ready to biff,' he said.

Mr Mergard urged those travelling overseas to register with the federal government's Smart Traveller website and get travel insurance.

He said people without it who break their leg or get sick could face medical costs between $60,000 to $70,000.

More than 30 Red Frogs Australia volunteers will be in Bali to help schoolies stay out of trouble
