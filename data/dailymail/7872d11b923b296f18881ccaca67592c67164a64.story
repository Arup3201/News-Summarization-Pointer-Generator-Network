Police were called to Manchester Airport to calm hundreds of angry passengers who were forced to wait more than two hours reclaim their luggage.

Passengers described scenes of ‘complete shambles’ and chaos, with little information, rising tempers and young children crying by the conveyor belt.

One incensed holiday maker is understood to have walked along a stationary baggage carousel in a bid to get access to cases through shutter doors, but no arrests were made.

Manchester Airport blamed contracted 
baggage handlers suffering a backlog after four flights landed within 
minutes of each other at Terminal One late Friday night.

The first of three Jet2 flights landed at 11.40pm, but passengers were not able to start reclaim their bags until 1.50am.

The
last flight, the Easyjet plane, landed at 1.30am, but cases didn't 
start to come out on the conveyor-belt carousels until 2.38am.

The baggage hall quickly filled up with hundreds of people returning from holiday, many of them families with young children.

Angry
passengers told of difficulties in getting information despite most of 
passenger jets are believed to have been full, one with 220 people on 
board.

Carl Austin, 41, from Burnage, landed with his partner and friends to scenes of 'chaos' after a week-long break in Tenerife.

He said: ‘The baggage hall was just packed with people from all the flights. It was incredible.

‘There was no one to speak to and it was just unbearable. There were announcements every half-hour apologising but blaming baggage handlers, although we were not told what the actual problem was.

‘One person walked onto the conveyor belt and started to bang on steel doors leading to the area behind the arrival hall.

'There was a lot of children there and it was awful. There were people waiting for luggage at all the carousels.

‘It was a complete shambles.’

Jackie Harrison, 51, from Denton, was also returning from Tenerife. She said: ‘People were not happy. It was unbelievable that we were waiting for that length of time.

‘Children were crying because push chairs were still on board and there was nowhere to sit. Children screaming was all we could hear. Nobody could give us any answers.

‘When we arrived a flight from Amsterdam had already been waiting for an hour and 20 minutes.’

Manchester Airport confirmed police attended the scene as a precaution.

A spokesman said Menzies Aviation handles baggage reclamation. The spokesman said: ‘Four flights landed at similar times unexpectedly due to some of them being delayed, which meant our baggage agents were faced with high volumes of bags from different flights.

‘The backlog was cleared as quickly as was possible and we returned to normal operations swiftly.

‘Situations like this are rare however we will be liaising with partners to ensure passengers are kept better informed and apologise to those passengers affected.’

Menzies Aviation could not be reached for comment.
