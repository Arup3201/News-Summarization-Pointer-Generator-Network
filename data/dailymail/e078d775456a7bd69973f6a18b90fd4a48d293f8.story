A McLaren supercar worth £250,000 was left almost entirely destroyed after it crumpled following a crash in one of London's most exclusive districts, scattering its expensive parts across the road.

The McLaren 650S Spider, which can reach speeds of more than 124mph in less than nine seconds, was badly damaged after a head on crash with a more modestly priced Saab in Eaton Square in central London.

It is understood that the supercar, which was brand new and registered in Monaco, was turning right at traffic lights when the two vehicles collided on Saturday evening.

The convertible McLaren 650S Spider was launched last year and is powered by a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged engine developing around 640bhp.

This gives the car, which is built in Woking, a 0-62mph time of less than three seconds and a top speed of 204mph.

An entry-level 650S Spider costs £215,000, with the extras on this model likely to push the price towards £250,000.

A basic model of the convertible costs around £215,000 but extras can add tens of thousands of pounds to the price. 

The car can reach 60mph in less than three seconds, and 100mph in less than nine seconds.

Top speed is 207mph — nearly three times the legal UK motorway speed limit — and it will cover a standing quarter mile (400m) in a mere 10.5 seconds. 

It has seven gears, allowing drivers to reach top speeds often seen on race tracks.  

The car's engine capacity is 3,799cc and it has a fuel capacity of 72 litres.  

It is a full second quicker than the iconic McLaren F1 road car to 124mph

The car includes a satnav, rear parking camera, bluetooth, digital radio and voice control. 

It was built in Woking, Surrey.
