Kim first ran into the man when he held the door for her so she could walk into a furniture showroom in Beverly Hills - just before midday today.

'As Kim walked in, the guy allegedly said, 'F**k these 
fa**ot-ass n****rs' referring to the paparazzi,' TMZ reported.

The reality star told the young man that the N-word was not appropriate to use.

That's when the teenager turned on the TV star, screaming, 'F**k you bitch. Just trying to help you. Shut up n****r lover, stupid slut.'

A perturbed Kardashian then allegedly phoned Kanye, 36, to tell him what was happening.

Then, according to TMZ, 'when the guy realized Kanye was on the phone he allegedly said, 'F**k you N****r.' - so that the rap star could hear.

However, just minutes later, an enraged Kanye arrived to meet up with Kim and learn face-to-face what had happened.

Kanye and Kim then stormed into the office and 
reportedly found the teen sitting there. 'Witnesses say Kanye punched 
the guy and Kim screamed, 'We have it all on tape'.

A third party had to separate the two men and shortly after police were called.

Beverly Hills Police officers arrived on the scene but West and his fiancée had already left, the BHPD confirmed on Monday.

However, the 18-year-old said he wanted to press charges.

'Kanye was named as a suspect by the victim as well as witnesses. He had left prior to our arrival, and detectives are currently investigating,' Beverly Hills Police Sgt. George DeMarois told the New York Daily News.

'The named suspect was identified as Kanye West by the victim and several witnesses,' police said according to a Beverly Hills Police Department statement.

Representatives for West have not responded to a request for comment, while a rep for Kardashian had no comment about the incident.

Nasty day: The beauty was called a 's***' by a stranger as she was trying to make an appointment

However, a witness who spoke to E! Online told a slightly different story that did not include a physical altercation.

'Kim and Kanye were meeting for an appointment today,' a source on Monday told E! Online.

'Kim arrived later than Kanye. En route into the building Kim saw a young man yelling racial slurs at the paparazzi.

'Kim told him he shouldn't use racial slurs and he turned on her and verbally assaulted her,' said a source who witnessed the event to E! Online.

The source backed up the claim that the young man began to verbally abuse Kardashian telling her to 'shut the f**k up' and that they then continued their conversation inside an office building.

'The two ended up in a stairwell where the man was in her face and continued to verbally assault her,' the insider added. 'She was genuinely scared.'

It was then that Kardashian took a phone call from her fiancé.

'Kanye called her phone and she answered and the man continued yelling at her,' the source told E! Online. 'Kanye overheard and came running down...he confronted the guy.'

'The guy continued with the slurs,' the source said. 'He was in Kanye's face and wouldn't stop. He was taunting him. Police were called to the scene.'

He left in style too: The 36-year-old took off in Kim's Mercedes-Benz G-wagon after the alleged altercation on Monday

The young man was later seen leaving the medical building with a sweatshirt wrapped around his head.

A source close to Kim Kardashian told People.com that it was the young man who started the entire incident.

'Kim was walking into a furniture meeting for their new home,' the source tells PEOPLE.

'Kanye was there ahead of her for the meeting. So Kim gets there and walks into the building with a million paparazzi trailing her.'

It was then that the man began to fire racial and homophobic insults at the paparazzi - which led Kardashian to admonish him.

The man then began to scream at her and hurl racial ephithets at Kanye and about her.

'At this point Kim was seriously afraid for her life,' the source continues. 'He was going nuts. Kanye came down to help her but then the guy ran into a chiropractic office so Kim and Kanye walked in after him.'

It was then at one point that Kanye hit him - 'barely'.

Kanye West is already facing charges battery and attempted grand theft after another altercation with a photographer at LAX last summer.

Photographer, Daniel Ramos told police that he was taking pictures of Kanye when the suspect attacked him.

West's lawyer, Blair Berk has entered a plea of not guilty on his client's behalf and the case is scheduled to be heard on January 23.

Rob Wilcox, spokesman for the Los Angeles city attorney's office, said each of the two charges carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail.
