A four-month-old Orangutan is recovering after having the tips of his fingers hacked off, allegedly during forest clearances for a new oil palm plantation in Indonesian Borneo.

Sura, who was discovered by a resident of the Tumbang Koling village in East Kotawaringin Regency, is being nursed back to health by specialists at the Nyaru Menteng Rescue centre.

Vets carried out a full health check and discovered three of his fingers had been severed by either a knife or machete.

Sura now needs to be cared for by a full-time babysitter.

British charity Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation is helping fund the centre and Sura's care.

It is the latest scandal to emerge in the
 controversy over deforestation as companies plough through Indonesia's wildlife to build oil 
plantations.

The sweep has caused a rapid decline in the orangutan population.

Environmentalists fear they have years of
 work ahead of them in educating remote villages about the need to 
protect, not capture or kill, these animals whose numbers are falling 
dramatically.

About 100 years ago it was thought 
there were 315,000 orangutans in the wild but today there are less than 
54,000 in Borneo and only around 6,000 on the Indonesian island of 
Sumatra.

As manufacturers look for places to cultivate oil for soaps and perfumes, the primates' natural habits are being ploughed by bulldozers.

And now homeless, many have been captured by local villagers, abused, and used for entertainment.

Last month, International Animal Rescue saved an orangutan from Tempurkan, which had no food or water and was being forced to dance and fight with humans.

Alerted by a villager, the charity found Ael - which means 'Saint' - sedated her and then moved her to a rescue centre. She will be released into the wild when a safe area in the forest can be found for her.

Meanwhile, the villagers have been told that catching and keeping an orangutan is against the law in Indonesia.
