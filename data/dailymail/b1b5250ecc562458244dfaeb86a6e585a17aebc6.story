Arsenal leading the way, Crystal Palace fighting for the Champions League places and Chelsea in the relegation zone.

The Barclays Premier League table would certainly look very different if only goals by English players counted.

The Gunners would lead the standings but all their wins would be 1-0 and their other games would have ended goalless.

How the Premier League table would look at the moment if only goals from English players counted

Danny Welbeck has scored twice in the Premier League for Arsenal and the Gunners would be sitting pretty at the top of the table if goals from English players were the only ones counted

Arsenal have assembled an English core this season, including (from left), Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere

The goals of Saido Berahino would propel West Brom to fourth place in the English scorers' table

Danny Welbeck would have won two of those matches for them, with Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain settling the others.

Chelsea, who lead the way by four points in the real standings, would be 18th and still searching for their first goal of the season.

None of their English players have yet hit the target in the Premier League this season and the fact the Blues are 18 places lower in this Anglo table shows the cosmopolitan make-up of their squad.

The goals of Raheem Sterling would have carried Liverpool to third in this Premier League table

Wayne Rooney's goals would only carry United to a mid-table position

Swansea, Liverpool and West Brom would occupy the Champions League spots and the Reds would be the top scorers thanks mainly to the goals of Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling.

And Saido Berahino's seven goals for the Baggies would have them challenging for a place in the elite European competition.

Manchester City would find themselves down in sixth but their rivals United slump to 10th with only Wayne Rooney's trio of goals counting.
