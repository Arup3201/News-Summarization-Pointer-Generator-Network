David Cameron will today insist that Scotland 'puts the great into Great Britain' as he seeks to love-bomb voters north of the border considering voting for independence

David Cameron will today insist that Scotland ‘puts the great into Great Britain’ as he seeks to love-bomb voters north of the border considering voting for independence.

The Prime Minister is embarking on a two-day anti-independence tour of Scotland following jitters in Westminster about the state of the ‘no’ campaign ahead of the referendum taking place on September 18.

Speaking in Glasgow, he will declare: ‘My message is simple. We want Scotland to stay.’

Mr Cameron is playing ‘good cop’ to George Osborne’s ‘bad cop’ – with the Chancellor yesterday delivering the most explicit warning yet to Scots that they can only keep the pound if they vote to remain in the United Kingdom.

He told voters in Scotland: ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t break it.’

Mr Osborne told MPs there were ‘no ifs and no buts’ and a UK government led by whatever party would reject Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond’s plan for a currency union if nationalists win the referendum.

Mr Osborne told MPs that he, Ed Balls, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, and Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, have ‘all made it clear that there will not be a currency union if Scotland becomes independent’.

He also predicted that the banking sector, which makes up a large part of Scotland’s economy, would leave if it found itself in a country with no central bank to print currency.

Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the Treasury permanent secretary, appearing before a Commons committee alongside the Chancellor, warned that Scottish interest rates could rise by up to 5 per cent if it refused to pay its share of the UK’s national debt as an independent nation.

Nationalists have suggested that an independent Scotland might take this course if Westminster refuses to let it keep on using the pound.

But Sir Nicholas, taking the highly unusual step for a senior civil servant of entering a political debate, insisted Scotland would face disaster if it sought to dodge its share of debt.

Today, Mr Cameron will evoke the memory of the late Labour leader John Smith, a Scot.

‘People from all walks of life and all parts of the UK know, as I know, that we are all better together,’ he will say.

‘Twenty years ago this week, John Smith died. Whatever people thought of his policies, nobody could argue that he was a proud Scot who wanted the best for his country

‘And why not? He knew that loving your country and at the same time wanting to be part of something bigger does not make you any less Scottish.

'That truth is shared by millions of others. So my message is simple. We want Scotland to stay. We are all enriched by being together. Scotland puts the great into Great Britain.

'Together we are a United Kingdom with a united future.’

Mr Cameron’s visit comes amid growing signs of nervousness in London at the possibility of nationalists clinching victory.

Some recent polls have suggested that the ‘yes’ campaign is closing the gap, with significant numbers of voters in Scotland yet to make up their minds.

Labour ‘big beasts’ are being drafted in to relaunch the ‘no’ campaign following a whispering campaign against the ‘lacklustre’ former Chancellor Alistair Darling, head of Better Together.

Mr Darling yesterday laughed off suggestions he had been sidelined, but sources said Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, and John Reid, the former home secretary, would take more prominent roles from now on.
