A woman found a DVD in her boyfriend's briefcase - and was stunned to watch a secret film of his female colleagues using their office toilet.

Shocked Rachel Jones, 27, from Swansea, South Wales, then texted his workmates to warn them about the camera hidden in the toilets of the education offices.

A court heard it was 'every woman's nightmare' when Ms Jones, a shopworker, discovered her live-in boyfriend, Matthew Hopkins, 29, was a secret Peeping Tom.

But the court heard she wanted to protect the 14 women colleagues from Hopkins.

She grabbed his phone to text the women: 'I have something distressing to tell you. He has been filming you at work.

'I am sorry to tell you this - he is disgusting.'

Hopkins yesterday escaped with a three-year community order after being found guilty of filming 14 different women in the education department of Swansea council in South Wales.

Prosecutor Natasha Morgan said: 'Hopkins purchased a covert camera from eBay and set it up in the toilets concealed behind a partition.

'The camera was sound activated and would start up when someone came into the room.

'His voyeurism was exposed by his ex-partner Rachel Jones after she found a disc in his bag, that disc had files showing various women using the toilet.

'Rachel identified one of the women as a work colleague she knew from his Facebook and decided to confront Hopkins.

'He admitted recording the women to her and said he would watch the tapes when she was out at work for sexual gratification.

'Rachel then sent a text to various contacts on Hopkins' phone telling them of what he had done.

Swansea Crown Court heard the 14 different victims felt 'violated, shocked and distressed'.

Administration officer Hopkins was confronted by women workers - but denied making the DVD and said his girlfriend was 'causing trouble.'

CCTV footage at the council offices revealed Hopkins going into work at 6.30am the next day - and he is believed to have dismantled the camera.

Ms Jones then searched their flat to find a second disc and recognised another of Hopkins' colleagues from the spy film.

Miss Morgan said: 'Rachel sent the woman a message on Facebook and informed her of the disc.

'Rachel agreed to hand it over to the woman, who intended to hand it over to the Human Resources department at the council.'

The court heard Hopkins was sacked and his bosses called in police.

Ms Jones had been sharing a flat in Mount Pleasant, Swansea, with Hopkins but the pair have split - and he has moved back to his mother.

Hopkins, now of Brecon, Powys, admitted 14 counts of voyeurism of 'recording other persons during a private act for the purpose of sexual gratification, knowing they did not consent.'

Defending, Simon Howell said: 'He made a full and frank admission.

'The consequences are far-reaching; the inevitable loss of employment and future employment prospects are seriously hampered by this, as well as the serious social stigma attached to offences of this kind.'

Hopkins was ordered to attend a sex offenders' rehabilitation programme and told to register as a sex offender for five years.

He was put under a restraining order preventing him from contacting or approaching his 14 victims.

Judge Keith Thomas said: 'This was a grossly offensive breach of their right to privacy by you for your sexual gratification.

'It was also a gross breach of trust to spy on people who you work with.

'They feel embarrassed and humiliated that their privacy has been violated by a Peeping Tom.'

Judge Thomas said he had a choice to jail Hopkins or put him on a course to protect women from his deviant sexual behaviour.

Ms Jones declined to comment after the case but a friend said: 'It was a terrible shock to find that the man you are living with is a secret pervert.

'She just couldn't let it carry on and had to tell his colleagues what he was doing. She is moving on and rebuilding her life.'
