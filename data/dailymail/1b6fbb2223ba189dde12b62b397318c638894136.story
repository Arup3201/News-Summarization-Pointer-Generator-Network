Mathieu Debuchy is on the brink of completeing an £11million switch to Arsenal from Premier League rivals Newcastle.

The France right-back had been linked to the Gunners for weeks and he looks set to finally sign after his return from the World Cup.

France were knocked out in the World Cup quarter-finals with Germany and Debuchy flew back to England to complete a medical with the Gunners on Monday.

Arsenal's move for Debuchy follows the departure of Bacary Sagna to Manchester City on a free transfer this summer.

Debuchy was preferred to Sagna in the France starting line-up throughout the World Cup.

The 28-year-old made 46 appearances for Newcastle, scoring just once - against arch-rivals Sunderland.

He signed for the Magpies from Lille for £5.5m in January 2013.

Newcastle are looking at Manchester City's Micah Richards and Arsenal's Carl Jenkinson as replacements.
