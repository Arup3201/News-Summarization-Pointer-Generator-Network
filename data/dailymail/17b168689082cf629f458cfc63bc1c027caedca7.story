Racist Ukrainian hooligans have been posting hundreds of stickers in Donetsk, promising violent clashes with the army of up to 10,000 England fans who have started flocking to the city ahead of the two countries’ match on Tuesday.

After England's fightback against Sweden on Friday, loyal fans are desperately trying to get to the Ukraine in time for their final clash.

But the fans who are swamping travel agents with calls may be shocked by the welcome some Ukrainians are planning for them.

The stickers appearing all over Donetsk depict images of fictional British hooliganism taken from the film Green Street, along with the slogans 'We are waiting for you' and 'We are ready to fight'.

A former leader of Donetsk’s hardcore 
hooligans the ‘Ultras’, who gave his name as Sergey, said: ‘We have top 
respect for the English football hooligan movement – it is what we grew 
up on and how we learned to support our clubs.

‘Even if the police threaten us there will always be a threat in Donetsk towards the black and Asian fans who call themselves English, not only because of us Ukrainians but because there are so many Russians here who will unite with us.

'We share the same ideologies that we have to protect our nation.’

Police have issued scores  of banning orders to known hooligans and enlisted up to 1,000 officers to try to prevent clashes.

Donetsk police chief Roman Romanov said: ‘The situation is under constant analysis.

'We will be ready to deploy officers at any time.’

The hooligans are not the only problem UK fans face.

Airlines are heavily booked, so many also face marathon journeys by road and rail to reach Donetsk.

If fans can manage to reach the city in time for Tuesday’s crucial game with Ukraine at the Shaktar Stadium, they may find hotel rooms in short supply.

Last night the first fans to arrive from England were frantically scouring the city and searching the web in internet cafes for the few hotels with rooms still available, the Sunday Express reported.

It is estimated that England supporters will swell from 5,000 to 10,000 for the game.
