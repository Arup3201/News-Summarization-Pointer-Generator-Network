It may be in the same retail group as high-fashion Meccas Topshop and Miss Selfridge but for years BHS has been languishing in the style stakes - until it unveiled its slick new autumn collection.

In an exclusive first look at the department store's new advert, it is clear that BHS is adamant to give the most glamorous of its high street competitors a run for their money.

The sexy new campaign, which sees a Cara Delevingne lookalike model getting dressed for work, was created with the working mother in mind.

Sexy new makeover: BHS have unveiled a slick new autumn collection and a sexy ad campaign to go with it

'We know that working mums across the 
country often multi-task with getting the kids ready for school, 
shopping, sorting the bills, going to work, and we wanted to create a
campaign that would inspire her to look stylish and confident whilst 
juggling all the things that life throws her way,' said BHS of the new advert.

The store - which is owned by Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group - say that it aims to instil confidence in the working mum and offer her products that will make her look good - while still being affordable.

The
music choice of I am a W.O.M.A.N by Peggy Lee was key to the store's female empowerment 
theme, and the model's confident demeanous as she dresses, staring down the camera, backs it up.

BHS CEO Richard
Price said today: 'We recognise that it is the woman that is often 
the linch-pin that keeps the family together.

'We want to reach out to her
and show that we can make her life easier while encouraging to treat 
herself from time to time.

'BHS has changed over
the last 12 months and we are ready to shout about what we have to 
offer.'

BHS 
Creative Director Jacqui Gray  added: ‘Our job is to celebrate and appeal to 
Britain’s domestic CEOs – those wonderful women who hold down jobs, keep
their families together and are always there for their friends.

They 
are amazing and we are here to help them look and feel great.'

The campaign, which airs on September 18 during Coronation Street will be followed through with a press and digital campaign and will run until 7 October.

The concept was created by Joint and the film was directed by Jonas Akerlund, famous for his work with Beyonce.

Jonas
said: 'I'm genuinely excited about working with Joint on the BHS 
campaign which celebrates British women and inspires them to look good 
in great fashion from a great British company.'

They're back! BHS have had a style overhaul and unveiled a fresh and slick new A/W13 collection (Coat £65, blouse £22, skirt £26, croc clutch £20, leather gloves £18)

Wearable: The store hope their new collection evokes simplicity, elegance and sophistication (L-belted coat £65, bag £28, R- biker jacket £55, roll neck £10, jeans £22)

The new range is designed to evoke 'simplicity, elegance and sophistication' and the store say they hope to offer 'modern-day ladylike glamour combined with structured fits and clean lines'.

And all with a purse-friendly price tag.

'BHS Womenswear AW13 is a measured mix of
clever pieces and wardrobe essentials that have created a very wearable
and confident collection designed to suit every woman,' say the store.

Easy to wear monochrome is key and comes in the form of 
stripes, geometrical prints, florals and bold mono-blocking.

And  for the more adventurous there 
are plenty of subtle colour injections with tones of emerald, claret, 
rust, teal and cobalt.

Fashion forward: Monochrome and checks are key to the collection and come in the form of stripes, geometrical prints and bold mono-blocking (L- jumper £28, bag £28, R- pyjama set £28)

In a nod to Chanel's Highland trend, classic shapes have been updated with tweed, textured knits, faux leather trimming, quilting and jacquard.

And in another homage to high fashion the brand has used super chic model Susannah, who bares a striking resemblance to It girl Cara Delevingne, to showcase the collection.

Key looks for the new season are oversized knits or box tops worn with leather or print pencil skirts and the collection also serves up tweed coats, shift dresses and tunics.

BHS have also taken note of the sports luxe trend, as championed by Rihanna, Rita Ora and Cara Delevingne, and introduced the style with silk-mix print bomber jackets and a quilted bomber teamed peg-leg trousers.

Comfort and style: there are plenty of cosy knits, black jeans and nude heels in the new collection, which starts at £10 (Jumper £25, trousers £22)

On trend: Classic shapes have been updated with tweed, textured knits, faux leather trimming, quilting and jacquard (L-tunic £35, roll neck £10, R-textured coat £65, roll neck £10, trousers £22)

For outerwear, there are tweed and leather biker jackets, as well as khaki long jackets, which can be teamed with a roll neck and the boyfriend jean.

As for footwear, the store have stuck to vintage-inspired styles with low block heel courts, Mary Janes and kitten heels.

But for those looking to add a tougher edge, there's sturdy biker boots, jewel coloured suede shoe boots and brogues.

BHS A/W13 is available in-store and online.

BHS began life in the 1970s 
and was acquired by Sir Philip Green in 2002 and incorporated into the 
Arcadia group in 2009.

In early 2006, Philip considered selling the store and contacted rivals including Asda and Debenhams with no success.

In 2010, BHS gave itself a brand 
overhaul by changing its logo, resurrecting the uppercase form of the 
abbreviation, launching an e-commerce website and a new store design.

Richard Price is current CEO.

BHS has 179 stores nationwide and it has a rolling programme to modernise them; about a quarter of the stores are now in the new formats.

BHS has 18 dedicated Home stores across the country.

BHS.co.uk offers over 30,000 products with on-line exclusives.

BHS is expanding its international portfolio, currently at 90 stores.

Pyjama set £28

It might have been given a glamorous new makeover but BHS has still kept its eye on the retail prize: the 30something professional woman with a bit of money to spend.

Like M&S, who has recently turned around its womenswear offering, the brand has listened to its customers and delivered wearable pieces that can be slotted in to an existing wardrobe (complete with longer hemlines and sleeves) rather than chasing the trends and trying to compete with 'younger' brands like Topshop or Primark.

Interest comes in flashes of design detail rather than a too-short skirt or plunging neckline and while there is a nod to successful trends from the last few seasons (pyjamas as outerwear, pictured right, were first seen in loud prints on the Stella McCartney S/S '12 catwalk) the success of this collection lies in its simplicity: key pieces in easy-to-wear colours that will update a look without breaking the bank.

Favourite pieces include the Crombie-style coat which I'll be wearing with skinny leather trousers and the biker jacket worn with a 60s style polo neck.
