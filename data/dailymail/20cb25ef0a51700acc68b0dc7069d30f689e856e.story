Popular: Reverend Richard Lee (above) has been suspended from his post after being arrested on suspicion of voyeurism

A married vicar has been suspended from his job after he was arrested on suspicion of voyeurism.

The Rev Richard Lee, 48, has been on police bail since the summer while officers investigate the case.

Police yesterday refused to reveal details of the claims against him.

Mr Lee is the Church of England vicar for two Somerset village churches near Weston-super-Mare, St Augustine’s in Locking and St Mary’s in Hutton, where his 47-year-old wife, the Rev Anne Lee, also works.

He is also the co-ordinator of a local music group called WWJD.

The couple – who met while studying to be vicars and have two children – moved from their previous parish in Kent five years ago.

Yesterday members of his previous congregation expressed shock at his arrest.

A female parishioner at All Saints Church in Hempstead, Kent, said: ‘Richard was really popular here. He got on with everyone.

'I’m pretty shocked to hear [of his arrest].’ 

Last night it was not clear whether or not Mrs Lee is still officiating at services while her husband is on police bail.

The vicar, who grew up in Fowey, Cornwall, is according to a social networking site profile, interested in ‘anything to do with railways’, sailing, reading, walking, the theatre, cinema and listening to and playing music.

A spokesman for the Diocese of Bath and Wells said: ‘We can confirm that the Rev Richard Lee was arrested in July 2012.’

He added: ‘In accordance with the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003, the Bishop of Bath and Wells suspended Mr Lee from active ministry as soon as he was arrested.

‘The Diocese of Bath and Wells has and will continue to fully co-operate with police enquiries.’

During his time at All Saints’ he raised money for the Friends of Chernobyl’s children charity by having a David Beckham makeover.

Rev Lee had his head shaved in a Beckham-style skinhead and wore a stud earring during a service at the church.

Mr Lee had promised to shave his locks in front of his flock if he raised at least £700 in sponsorship money, but local support saw the total soar to more than £1,370.

But he drew the line at copying Beckham entirely and having a tattoo on his back.

At the time, he said: ‘I won’t be getting a tattoo like Beckham and I have to refuse point blank to have my legs waxed.’

Yesterday a spokesman for Avon and Somerset police said: ‘We arrested a 48-year-old man from Weston on suspicion of voyeurism in July of this year.

‘Investigations are ongoing and the man remains on police bail.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
