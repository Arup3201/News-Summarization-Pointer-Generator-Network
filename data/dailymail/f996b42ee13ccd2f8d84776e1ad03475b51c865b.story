The good news for all concerned in Monaco was that it had stopped raining.

Arsene Wenger had raised fears on the eve of the game and as the downpour continued into the night the Arsenal manager wasn't the only one casting anxious glances skywards.

This is a big day for the new AS Monaco and they do not want it washed out.

Arsene Wenger had raised fears over the playing surface at Monaco's Stade Louis II on Monday night

A recent game against Montpellier had been cancelled and because the pitch at the Stade Louis II is a notoriously poor surface, with so much going on beneath it: car parks, swimming pools, etc groundstaff worked through the night to help it drain as they prepare for what they hope will be a famous victory, one which will see them into the last eight of the Champions League for the first time since 2004, when they went on to the final and lost to Jose Mourinho's Porto.

Much has happened to Monaco since then. They almost dropped into the third tier of French football and faced extinction before Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev came to the rescue and got them moving in the right direction once again.

The first leg result against Arsenal was confirmation that the Rybolovlev project is still on track, having survived a change of direction and an exodus of top players like James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao last summer.

No club in the Champions League era has surrendered a two-goal lead after playing the first leg away and Leonardo Jardim's team prides itself on tight defence.

They have conceded only once in the last 12 home games and are quietly confident history will not be rewritten, with Jardim expected to enhance his reputation for caution by making a tweak or two to his team to make it even more solid.

If they park the Bentley as smartly as they did at the Emirates Stadium, it promises to be one of the great nights in Monaco's recent history.

The 18,000 capacity stadium is sold-out, which rarely happens. There were fewer than 6,000 in to see them beat nine-man Bastia on Friday, a 3-0 win which kept them in touch with the Ligue 1 leaders.

Despite its rich history, Monaco will never be one of the France's football hotbeds. It is a unique club set in the playground of the privileged, where most of the local residents are far wealthier than any of the players and many of them more recognisable.

In Monte Carlo, the most famous of the Principality's districts, you would hardly know there was a big Champions League game on.

The stadium is set in Fontvieille, a district reclaimed from the sea in the 1970s, and cut off by a tunnel from the more recognisable sights such as Casino Square, the Opera, a harbour crammed with super-yachts and the Grand Prix circuit.

Work has started this week in preparation for the Monaco Grand Prix in May.

Wenger's first return to the club he managed for seven years until 1994 fails to make the social calendar for many of those who settle here to enjoy tax-free life in the world's smallest monarchy.

L'Equipe has devoted it's pages to Tuesday's clash

Prince Albert, the ruling monarch, continues to support the club he used to run and will be at the game, as the French attempt to claim another football triumph against the English after Chelsea were knocked out by Paris St Germain last week.

French sports paper L'Equipe devoted its first five pages to the game with the disciplinary saga of PSG idol Zlatan Ibrahimovic relegated to Page 6. Instead, rival strikers Olivier Giroud and Dimitar Berbatov were pitched head-to-head on the front.

At Stade Louis II on the eve of the game, Wenger was met by Monaco's vice-president Vadim Vasilyev and presented with a framed picture designed to commemorate his work at the club, where he won the French title in 1988.

In an interview with Sportsmail, last month, ahead of the first-leg, Vasilyev hailed Wenger as 'one of the iconic coaches of modern football' but the Arsenal manager is not big on sentiment.

He was wounded by the 3-1 defeat in the first leg and aware that history is against a glorious comeback, but the noises from the Arsenal camp were all about believing the impossible to be possible.

With their array of attacking talent, scoring three goals seems an achievable target. Keeping Monaco at bay at the other end while doing so, may be a different proposition.
