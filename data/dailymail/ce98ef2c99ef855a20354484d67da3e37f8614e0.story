A four-month-old baby miraculously survived after her mother's car crashed into a ditch leaving her trapped under water for four minutes.

Beckie Thompson, 21, was driving daughter Imogen to nursery when she lost control of her Peugeot 206 while swerving to avoid another vehicle in Spalding. It rolled over into the dyke and landed on its roof.

The trainee nurse, who had only been driving six weeks, was flung back on to the rear seats of the car. But she managed to climb out and then began desperately hunting for her baby.

To her horror, Miss Thompson saw her 
child's toes poking out of the water. She pulled Imogen, still strapped 
into her car seat, free and placed her on the bank.

By that stage the little girl had been underwater for four minutes and her lips and fingers were blue.

Her
mother realised she was not breathing and started screaming for help. A
motorist who stopped his car after witnessing the accident ran over and
wrapped the baby in his T-shirt.

He then performed CPR for three minutes before the baby began to cry.

Miss
Thompson said: 'It is a miracle that she is alive. For all intents and 
purposes she was dead for seven minutes, four in the car, then three at 
the roadside.

'It was like 
an out-of-body experience, like I was watching a soap or something. She 
had blue lips and blue fingertips. I really didn't think she was going 
to wake up.

Lucky to be alive: The wreckage of Beckie Thompson's car shows just how lucky she was to have survived a crash into a ditch

The remains of Beckie Thompson's car which overturned in a ditch. Her four-month old daughter Imogen was trapped underwater for four minutes.

'That poor man 
was shaking and crying as he tried to resuscitate her. He kept going 
until she started to make a noise. He kept on going until she was fully 
screaming.

'I can't thank him enough - I owe my little girls' life to him.'

'The doctors don't really know how she managed to survive, let alone escape without any brain damage.'

'Maybe it's because she is a bit of a chubbier baby, but it is still a total mystery.'

Imogen
was airlifted to the Queen's Medical Centre, in Nottingham, after the 
accident on September 17. She had water pumped from her lungs and 
stomach and had to stay in hospital for four nights.

The
little girl is now back home with her mother and sister Alexis, five. 
Miss Thompson was treated for cuts to her face and a minor puncture 
injury where her car keys pierced her elbow.

She does not know the identity of the stranger who saved her baby's life but is desperate to meet him so she can thank him.

The car rolled into this ditch in Spalding, Lincolnshire after Imogen's mother swerved to avoid another car

A spokeswoman from the East Midlands 
Ambulance Service also confirmed that Imogen had been underwater for
a number of minutes.

She said: 'We got called to a report of a car upside down and that police were on route.

"Paramedics were also advised that the car had gone into a dyke and the baby wasn't breathing.

'When we arrived CPR had already been commenced by a bystander.'

 A leading paediatrician from the Royal College 
of Paediatrics and Child Health has said it is possible that Imogen 
survived because her metabolism was slowed by the cold water.

Dr
Tim Ubhi, a Consultant Paediatrician from Airedale NHS Trust, said: 'If a 
young child is submerged in cold water then a number of reflexes come 
into play which result in a slowing down of the child's metabolism thus 
reducing the need for oxygen.

'In addition, during drowning the muscles around the throat may act to prevent the inhalation of water into the lungs.

'Together these reflexes make resuscitation more likely to be successful by limiting damage to vital organs including the brain.

'With
effective resuscitation there is a possibility that an infant submerged
in cold water could survive and not suffer significant brain damage.'
