Tragic: Banker Nico Lambrechts, seen in a holiday snap with wife Adele, fell to his death at London's Coq d'Argent restaurant in October last year

A banker who jumped to his death from the terrace of an exclusive London restaurant was under 'enormous pressure' at work and struggling to pay his children's school fees, an inquest heard this morning.

Nico Lambrechts fell seven floors from the Coq d'Argent restaurant, a notorious suicide spot, just months after starting a job at investment bank Investec.

City of London Coroner's Court heard how the father of three became stressed over a forthcoming move back to South Africa, and had been unable to transfer money from his home country to fund his children's education.

Mr
Lambrechts died of multiple injuries last October after climbing over 
the wall surrounding the restaurant's terrace, minutes after a long 
phone conversation with his wife which was captured on CCTV.

The restaurant has now taken steps to deter suicide attempts after four people died there in the past five years.

Mr Lambrechts' GP, Mark Jenkins, told the hearing that the banker was largely healthy.

'I
understand from his widow that he was under an enormous amount of 
pressure from his new work which must have become unbearable,' the 
doctor said.

The 
inquest heard that when the South African first moved to London he had 
been given a lot of help by his firm, but that when he was scheduled to 
move back he had to make most arrangements himself.

Domenico Ferrini, who hired Mr 
Lambrechts at Investec in June last year, said that the banker had 
joined the company shortly before it was due to move its headquarters to
Cape Town.

'He was very interested to start with and it was a wonderful opportunity within our growing business,' he said.

'I
think there were a few things he was worried about. Relocating back to 
South Africa concerned him and the political climate there - was it the 
right thing?

'The 
transition of being very successful in his previous job, and having to 
re-establish himself at Investec. I tried to help him find his feet, 
that kind of thing.'

'Pressure': An inquest heard Mr Lambrechts, who fell to his death from the terrace of the restaurant at the top of the No1 Poultry in the City, had become stressed over a forthcoming move to South Africa

Another colleague, Duncan Coombe, said Mr Lambrechts had expressed concerns about his financial arrangements ahead of the move.

'He
couldn't claim access to his salary as he was being paid in South 
Africa,' he said. 'He had school fees for his children to pay and this 
was causing him concern.'

PC Trish Robinson, who investigated the death, told the inquest that CCTV footage made it clear the death was 'a very deliberate act', and suggested that Mr Lambrechts had been 'at a very low ebb'.

She added: 'On one occasion he had said he was going to be home and he hadn't turned up. His wife had been trying to get hold of him.

'Later on he said he had felt very low, he had been sitting somewhere and contemplated suicide.'

Coroner Roy Palmer said: 'I don't think there's any suggestion it was an accident. It was plainly a deliberate act.

'I think on the totality of the evidence I have to ensure, and I am sure that he intended to die by his actions. You do not go down seven floors and over a wall without that.'

A spokesman for the City of London said that authorities were in talks with Coq d'Argent to raise the barriers surrounding the terrace to around 2m, and added that a security guard was now being deployed on the roof to deter future suicide attempts.

Volunteers from the Samaritans have also spoken to staff at the restaurant to train them in what to do if anyone tries to jump.
