A bumblebee species reintroduced after being driven to extinction in the UK has nested and produced its first offspring.

The short-haired bumblebee vanished in the 1980s, having declined over 60 years as its wildflower-rich grassland habitat was lost. It was officially declared extinct in 2000.

Seven of the UK’s 27 bumblebee species are in decline and two have become extinct.

The short-haired bumblebee has nested and produced its first offspring in the UK since it became extinct here in the 1980s

Short-haired queens were brought over from a healthy population in Sweden, and after two releases at the RSPB’s Dungeness reserve in Kent, worker bees have been discovered for the first time.

Nikki Gammans, who led the project, said: 'This is a milestone for the project and a real victory for conservation.

'We now have proof that this bumblebee has nested and hatched young, and we hope it is on the way to become a self-supporting wild species in the UK.

'It’s been a long journey to get here, from creating the right habitat for them, collecting queens in the Swedish countryside, scanning them for diseases and then eventually releasing them at Dungeness.

'Seeing worker bees for the first time is a fantastic reward for all that hard work but we still have a long way to go to ensure this population is safe and viable.'

A first generation of queens collected and released last year struggled in the cold wet conditions last summer, but a second generation brought over from Sweden and released this summer bolstered the colony.

Further releases are planned to help build the population at Dungeness.

The reintroduction project has involved work with farmers to create flower-rich meadows and field margins in Dungeness and Romney Marsh, which have boosted populations of other threatened bumblebees.

Sightings of rare bees, including the ruderal bumblebee, the red shanked carder bee, the moss carder bee and the brown-banded carder bee, have increased.

Nationally, seven of the UK’s 25 native bumblebee species are in decline and two have become extinct, including the short-haired bumblebee.

The project to reintroduce the bee is backed by government agency Natural England, RSPB, Bumblebee Conservation Trust and Hymettus.
