Terminally ill people should turn to Jackie Collins and Jilly Cooper instead of Jesus to take their minds off death, according to a retired minister.

The Rev Ian Gregory says the dying should read bodice-rippers and bonkbusters rather than the Bible to resurrect 'joyful, rude memories' in their final days.

The retired Congregational minister, best known for founding the Polite Society, makes his recommendations in The Great Adventure, a pamphlet about preparing for death.

He suggests that the Bible's talk of sin, judgment and eternal damnation could be unsettling for those living with a terminal illness and recommends reliving romantic highs instead.

Mr Gregory said: 'When people are told they are dying reading the Bible might be the last thing they want to do.

'But they shouldn't be afraid to read a rude or lively book... something a bit saucy.

'The subject of death is still a bit taboo, like sex used to be, so why not?

'It might trigger some happy, joyful, rude memories.'

A book like Jilly Cooper's Riders could trigger 'happy, joyful, rude memories', says the Rev Ian Gregory

Racy novels, which could include Collins's Chances or Cooper's Riders, could cheer the soul, he said.

Mr Gregory, who used to celebrate mass at the Basford Congregational Church in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, was inspired to write the pamphlet after he was approached by a terminally-ill stranger.

The man had three months to live and wanted Mr Gregory to conduct his funeral.

The retired minister told the Daily Telegraph: 'I had thought about airing some of the material in my brochure before, but that chance meeting triggered me off.

'I have been approached by people to take their funerals several times, usually because they want it done by someone who knows about them, but this was a stranger.

'The man was obviously in distress because he had just been told about his condition and was trying to prepare for his demise. I have spoken to him a few times since and we have been over some of the things included in the brochure but I havenâ€™t asked him what he thinks.'

Mr Gregory founded the Polite Society, which later became the Campaign for Courtesy, in the mid-1980s to promote good manners.

The campaign counts Esther Rantzen and June Whitfield among its patrons.

He later had a Stoke-on-Trent pub, The Polite Vicar, named after him.
