The list may surprise you but falcons, live lobsters and pet pigs are some of the bizarre things that airlines will allow to fly.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has a prohibited items list as long as your arm, but antlers, cannisters of human remains and monkeys also make the cut.

In the case of a monkey, it is not just any old monkey. It is only service monkeys that are welcome aboard.

The Transportation Security Administration allows service monkey through security screening

A service monkey is a type of assistance animal, similar to an assistance dog, that is specially trained to help people with quadriplegia, severe spinal cord injuries, or other mobility impairments.

TSA officers visually inspect the service monkey and will coach the handler on how to hold the monkey during the visual inspection.

The inspection process may require the handler to take off the monkey’s diaper, but he can still board the plan.

A falcon can also buckle up next to you. German airline Lufthansa announced it will soon allow its passengers to travel with falcons.

Lufthansa will soon allow falcons on board, while Etihad Airways already allows customers this privilege

Live lobsters (pictured) and even crabs are perfectly fine to bring on as checked-in baggage on many airlines

Later this year, travellers will be able to take their hunting birds onboard in a newly-designed device called the ‘Falcon Master’ tray, which can be fitted with a cage.

The move is set to prove popular with the airline’s Middle East customers, where falconry is hugely popular.

The United Arab Emirates runs wild falcon conservation projects as well as breeding farms and veterinary hospitals for the animals.

For centuries hunting with falcons was a major source of meat in the harsh desert region, and the birds remain a national emblem, found on everything from corporate logos to banknotes.

But with wildlife under pressure, hunting has been restricted, and many affluent Emiratis now travel abroad to locations as far as Morocco, Pakistan and Central Asia.

In some countries and airlines, the Vietnamese pot-bellied pig is also now very trendy and has been legally classified as a 'companion animal'

Just in case you did not know, crematory remains are also allowed to be taken on board a flight

Antlers are also allowed to be transported on planes as long as they have the skull attached

Bowling balls also make the cut, with some airlines allowing the sporting equipment to travel with you

Other recreational equipment allowed is scuba diving gear for those who are partial to the past time

The same applies to fishing rods which can also go with their owners when they take to the skies

For example, Etihad Airways based in Abu Dhabi regulations accept the carriage of falcons in the main aircraft cabin provided that all the necessary documents have been obtained. They also accept falcons as checked baggage.

Meanwhile, live lobsters and even crabs are perfectly fine to check on many airlines, some even let you pre-book them as you would your dog. It is all dependent on how you pack them though as individual airline regulations may differ slightly.

But it is not just animals that some passengers have taken on flights. 

Christmas trees, crematory remains, your own personal parachute and antlers as long as the skull is wrapped have also been allowed on flights in the past too.
