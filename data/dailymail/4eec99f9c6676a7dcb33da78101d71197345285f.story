Miss Alabama has said she was 'flattered' by fawning comments made by two ESPN commentators as she cheered on her quarterback boyfriends during Monday night's game.

Speaking on the Today show, Katherine Webb, 23, said that there was 'no need' for the network's apology on Tuesday after the enthusiastic remarks made Kirk Herbstreit and Brent Musburger, 73.

'If he had said something along the 
lines of we were hot or sexy or any derogatory statements like that, 
that would have been a bit different,' she told the Today show on Wednesday morning.

'The fact that he said we were beautiful and gorgeous - I don't see why any woman wouldn't be flattered by that.'

Speaking out: Katherine Webb, who became an internet hit after ESPN commentators made gushing remarks about her as she cheered from the stands, said she was flattered by their comments

Webb, who is dating Alabama's quarterback A.J. McCarron, became an internet hit after cameras panned to her in the stands during the first quarter of the BCS Championship game between Alabama and Notre Dame on Monday.

'I'm telling you, you quarterbacks, you 
get all the good looking women,' Musburger gushed as the camera stayed on Webb. 
'What a beautiful woman.'

'Wow!' former Ohio State quarterback Kirk Herbstreit added. 'AJ's doing some things right down in Tuscaloosa.'

'If
 you're a youngster in Alabama, start getting the football out and throw
 it around the backyard with pop,' added Musburger, who has been married
 to his wife Arlene for 50 years.

With some media commentators and viewers branding their comments 'creepy', ESPN was forced to apologize on Tuesday.

'We
 always try to capture interesting
 storylines, and the relationship between an Auburn grad who is Miss 
Alabama USA and the current Alabama quarterback certainly met that test.
 However, we apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far
 and Brent understands that.'

But as well as Miss Webb herself, her father, Alan Webb, came to the defense of Musburger.

'On
 one hand, you can look at it as being kind of like the dirty old man,' 
he said. 'But I'm used to this and I think if you really look into what 
that he was trying to say, he was trying to be complimentary, and I 
think they need to give Brent a break.'

Within minutes of ESPN broadcasting her image, Miss Webb became an internet sensation and saw her Twitter followers soar from around 2,300 to more than 205,000 by Tuesday evening.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to say he would be offering Webb a place as a judge at the next Miss USA Pageant.

'We are proud of her,' he added. 'What a great couple... Katherine Webb and AJ McCarron. They are both winners.'

She also caught the eye of Arizona 
Cardinals defensive end Darnell Dockett, who posted his phone number on 
Twitter as he attempted to ask her out.

However McCarron was quick to step up for his girlfriend, tweeting: '@ddockett
 u better worry ab being in them playoffs, then going to king of 
diamonds homie.. #betterkeepdreaming like the rest of these dude.'

He later posted on Twitter: '@ddockett boy

know that. better stop eating them wings and win. All love.'

'[W]hen gave over [sic], lets go to wing stop then King of diamond,' Dockett had tweeted earlier, referring to a strip club.

He
 then realized the tweet was public, and added that it was supposed to 
be a direct message to her. The tweets have now been deleted.

Much to the disbelief of her boyfriend, Miss Webb also gained NBC star LeBron James as a follower.

'No way,' McCarron, 22, said repeatedly after learning about her new fan. 'Man, I'm going to Tweet him and I'm going to get a follow. That's messed up.'

Support: Webb and McCarron both laughed off the attention, and the QB added: 'I'm the one who's blessed'

Webb
 was also in shock about the reaction, revealing that her phone was 
drained of battery thanks to an influx of new followers, texts and 
calls.

'My followers went from 2,300 this 
morning to 96,000 by the end of the night,' she told Yahoo! Sports. 'I don't know if I should even
 check now, I don't know what is going on.

'I guess [Musburger] said something but I don't know what it was because I haven't seen it.''

But to McCarron, the attention came as no surprise.

'I know she's good looking,' McCarron 
said. 'She's gonna have guys that jaw-drop over her. That's life. I 
guess I'm the blessed one at the end of the day. She's gotta put up with
 me.'

Popular: After the broadcast, Webb's Twitter followers jumped from around 2,300 to more than 127,000

Model girlfriend: Webb, 23, also competed in Miss USA last year and placed in the top ten, left

Webb, who grew up in Montgomery, Alabama and graduated from Auburn, finished in the top ten in the Miss USA competition in June and lives and works as a model in Los Angeles.

McCarron and Webb met over Twitter 
when a friend connected them in November, and in December, the sportsman
 went to the pageant for Miss Alabama USA 2013, where Webb ended her 
reign.

The pair have been together since and grinned for photographs together on Christmas Eve.

They
 were pictured sharing a celebratory kiss at the end of the game on 
Monday - but after McCarron had already shared an embrace with his 
parents.

'That means he's a family guy, a mama's 
boy,' Webb told Yahoo! Sports. 'And I'm totally good 
with that. It's that personality that attracted me to him in the first 
place. It was never about his status on the team.'

McCarron also professed his admiration for his girlfriend.

'I think she was doing pretty well for 
herself before that, Miss Alabama and competing in Miss USA,' he said. 'She's a great girl and I'm happy we're together.'

Alabama beat Notre Dame 42-14 on Monday to win their third college football title in four years.
