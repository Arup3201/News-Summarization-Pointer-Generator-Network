At least two people were killed as a major storm pummeled the Pacific northwest and California with heavy rain and high winds, causing houses to be swallowed up by the ocean in Washington as power was knocked out to tens of thousands of homes.

In Oregon the 80mph winds proved deadly, with a teenage boy killed when a large tree fell on the vehicle he was travelling in, causing it to swerve and hit a tree. A homeless man was also killed by a falling tree.

Houses in Washaway Beach were ripped away by rising tides along the shore of Pacific County, with owners rushing to save any belongings before they were eaten up by the swirling sea. 

Fear of mudslides led to evacuations at 10pm last night in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendora, where the foothills were stripped bare by a major wildfire earlier this year.

Some 240 departing and incoming commercial flights were
canceled at San Francisco International Airport and others were
delayed for more than two hours, airport managers said.

As well as the two killed, a man in southwest Washington state, and a sixth-grader at an elementary school in Santa Cruz, California, were injured by falling trees.

Flights were cancelled and schools were closed as the tumultuous storm lashed the west coast throughout the evening.  

San Francisco's famed cable car system was replaced by
shuttle buses and a subway station was shut down through the
morning rush hour because of a power outage and flooding, and
the city's electrified bus system was halted in many areas,
transit officials said.

The Embarcadero, the city's popular waterfront walkway, was
closed due to flooding and some ferries were also canceled,
stranding commuters.

Some streets and major intersections were flooded in the San
Francisco area, including the westbound lanes of Interstate 280
in the East Bay suburb of El Cerrito, according to the
California Highway Patrol.

Winds howled through Sacramento, the state capital, rattling
buildings and whipping through trees before dawn, followed by
heavy downpours.

In southern Oregon, a homeless man camping with his

area was killed early on Thursday morning when a tree toppled
onto their tent, the Jackson County Sheriff's Office said.

A powerful storm churned through Northern California Thursday, knocking out power to tens of thousands and delaying commuters while soaking the region with much-needed rain

Portland General Electric Co and Pacific Power
reported nearly 90,000 customers were without power as a storm
system with wind-gusts of 80 mph (129 kph) was moving through
Oregon.

Meanwhile over 117,500 homes were without power in the Bay Area.

To the north, in Washington state, a commuter train that
runs between Seattle and Everett was canceled for two days
beginning on Thursday after a mudslide on Wednesday, local
transit officials said.

'In certain parts of the West Coast this could be the most
significant storm in 10 years,' National Weather Service
meteorologist Eric Boldt said.

The Weather Service issued flash-flood, heavy-surf and
high-wind advisories, warning that torrential rains could lead
to mudslides in foothill areas of California scarred by
wildfires earlier this year.

The storm was expected to provide only a small measure of
relief from California's record, multi-year drought that has
forced water managers to sharply reduce irrigation supplies to
farmers and prompted drastic conservation measures statewide,
weather officials said.

As much as 3ft (1m) of snow is predicted this week
for the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. 

But meteorologists said many months of rainfall would be needed
to pull the state out of the drought.

The so-called 'Pineapple Express' is an atmospheric river of moisture that often brings major weather events to North America's Pacific Coast.

The system is named for its origins in Hawaii, around where it gets its massive moisture content.

Via NOAA.gov: 

Atmospheric Rivers (AR) are relatively narrow regions in the atmosphere that are responsible for most of the horizontal transport of water vapor outside of the tropics.

While ARs come in many shapes and sizes, those that contain the largest amounts of water vapor, the strongest winds, and stall over watersheds vulnerable to flooding, can create extreme rainfall and floods. 

These events can disrupt travel, induce mud slides, and cause catastrophic damage to life and property. However, not all ARs cause damage – most are weak, and simply provide beneficial rain or snow that is crucial to water supply.

An average of between 30 to 50 percent of the total precipitation for the year on the West Coast comes from ARs.

The biggest events among them can transport in the form of water vapor between 7.5 and 15 times the average flow of liquid water at the mouth of the mighty Mississippi. 

This infographic from the National Weather System shows how atmospheric rivers operate. These formations, of which a Pineapple Express is one, bring up to 50 percent of the precipation to the West Coast that the region sees annually

The Shasta Lake area of Northern California received 5
inches (13 cm) of rain overnight, and up to 4 inches (10 cm)
were expected in California's Central Valley, the state's
agricultural heartland, as well as in Sacramento, the weather
service said.

Pacific Gas and Electric Co reported that some
276,000 customers lost power during the storm on Thursday. 

Cities in the peninsula area south of San Francisco were hardest
hit by outages.

Several Bay Area school districts, including San Francisco,
Oakland and Berkeley, canceled classes due to the storm.

The storm was expected to move into Southern California in
time for the Friday morning commute, in what would be the area's
second major storm in a week.
