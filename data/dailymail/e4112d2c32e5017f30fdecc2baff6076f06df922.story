A murder investigation is under way after a man died of an aneurysm following an assault at his home.

The victim, in his 70s, was attacked at his home in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, at about 9pm on Sunday night.

He collapsed and later died in hospital.

Post-mortem tests have proved inconclusive as to the cause of death but showed the man, who has not yet been named, sustained an aneurysm caused by the assault, Nottinghamshire Police said.

Detective Chief Inspector Tony Heydon has appealed for information, saying: 'Did you see anyone in a high-visibility jacket around 9pm on Sunday? If so, we need to hear from you'

Officers are seeking a man seen in the area at the time, who is described as white and of medium to heavy build. He was wearing dark clothing with a black hat or hood and a sleeveless, yellow high-visibility jacket.

Tonight the victim's house remained sealed off while forensic teams carried out detailed examinations of the scene.

A car parked in the house's driveway was taken away by police.

Detective Chief Inspector Tony Heydon, who is leading the investigation, said: 'We are still trying to establish the facts of what happened here, but it seems the victim was attacked in his home by a lone offender.

'The victim collapsed shortly afterwards and died at hospital.
