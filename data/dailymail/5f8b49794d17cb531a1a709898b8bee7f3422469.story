Fire investigators have determined sunlight reflecting off a makeup mirror was the most likely cause of a devastating blaze in a £3.5 million house last month.

Six fire crews attended the fire at the house in Caversham, Berkshire on Sunday, December 28.

The property is owned by Darren Browne, chief executive of the Pertemps employment agency.

Six fire crews attended the scene of the fire which destroyed the first and second floors of the house 

Fire investigators believe that the blaze started when strong sunlight reflected off a make-up mirror 

At the time, Mr Browne told Get Reading that the family had been out of the house at the time, but declined to make any further comment.

An investigation by officers at the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service has found that sunlight reflecting off a mirror onto curtains in a south-facing upstairs bedroom resulted in the fire, which caused serious damage to the first and second floor of the property, as well as its roof.

Station Manager Sean Keeley, who conducted the fire investigation, said: 'Cases of reflected light triggering fires in homes are rare, however we would urge the public to be aware of the potential danger of reflective surfaces intensifying the sun's rays.

'To minimise the risk of fire, please make sure reflective items such as mirrors are not placed in direct view of sunlight in the home - particularly during the winter months when the low-lying sun can shine on fixed surfaces for a prolonged period.'

Fire officers warned that the low sun during winter can reflect off a mirror causing a fire 

Shortly after the blaze neighbour Jenny Steven, from Warrenside flats, said: 'The first I saw was a plume of smoke and I thought it was a bit strange somebody having a bonfire going.

'It was only when I went to walk into town that I realised it was a bit more than that.'

She continued: 'It was burning for hours and hours. I went to bed at midnight last night and there were still flames.

Stuart Van Dort, who lives nearby said he initially feared it may have been his home which was destroyed: 'I felt very sorry for the poor people.

'A friend from a property behind sent a text message saying smoke was coming from this area which was a bit scary but we were OK.

'We know it was close but the fire brigade did a remarkable job because it was pretty fierce through the roof.'
