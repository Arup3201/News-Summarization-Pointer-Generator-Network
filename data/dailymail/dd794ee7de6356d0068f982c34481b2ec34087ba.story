Hosting a first birthday party? You might expect a fair bit of the food to end up smeared over the guests’ faces – or your floor.

But that’s no reason to leave quail’s egg croustades off the menu, according to Pippa Middleton.

In the Party Times, the online magazine of Middleton family business Party Pieces, editor Pippa has given her tips on how to organise a ‘fun’ first birthday celebration.

Pippa Middleton's suggestion for quail's egg croustades is also included in her book Celebrate

She includes the recipe for the fiddly finger-food – garnished with Hollandaise sauce and pan-fried crispy pancetta – but helpfully recommends that ‘to keep expense down’ you should limit canapes to two per person.

And her wisdom doesn’t end there. ‘Most of your guests will probably be crawling,’ the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister points out. ‘Create a baby-proof play zone with plenty of cushions.’

The 29-year-old has written a party planning book, Celebrate, which includes the very same recipe for croustades.

She was recently appointed as a columnist for Waitrose Kitchen magazine.

The April issue of Waitrose Kitchen will feature Pippa's first column

The magazine features the recipe alongside an advert for the book urging readers to ‘buy signed copies now!'

It also suggests making your offspring’s first milestone memorable by decorating the room with balloons because ‘babies all love balloons!’

Miss Middleton also advises: ‘Play some nursery and party music in the background... Or peek-a-boo is always a winner.’

And the grown-ups are not forgotten, either: ‘Set chairs around the area for parents to relax and watch’.

Doubtless none of this will whet the appetite of the shoppers who have flooded Waitrose’s Twitter and Facebook accounts with complaints after Pippa replaced Delia Smith, 71, whose cookery books have sold 21 million copies, as a columnist in the supermarket’s magazine.

The first column by Pippa, will be published in the April edition of Waitrose Kitchen, on sale from the end of this month.

The magazine’s editor has promised she will dispense sage advice on how to prepare a ‘Friday night feast’, and said her ‘wealth of experience’ will be ‘loved’ by readers.

For the record, quail’s eggs are about a quarter of the size of hen’s eggs - and a dozen quail’s eggs costs £2.35 from Waitrose.
