Its pencil skirts and cashmere cardigans are firm favourites with the likes of Michelle Obama and Angelina Jolie.

So British shoppers should have been delighted when J Crew opened its first European flagship store in London yesterday.

Instead, they were astonished – because the prices are up to three times higher than in the US, for exactly the same items.

Fleeced: The difference in price between J Crew's US and UK stores was laid bare as it opened in London

Hundreds of balloons were released as J.Crew, the iconic American retailer, opened its doors to the much anticipated Regent Street store in London

The Regent Street store is the brand's first British outpost and they have plans to open two or three more

The store located at 165 Regent Street will house separate womens and menswear departments along with Crewcuts childrenswear

Almost all the clothes and accessories in the new Regent Street store are on sale for the same amount of pounds as dollars, meaning a $350 (£219) black blazer is retailing at £350 – an increase of 60 per cent.

But some are being sold at a far greater mark-up, including a silk shirtdress which is on the US website at a special price of $99.99 (£63) before tax, but in the London shop for more than three times as much at £198.

The US prices do not include tax, which varies by state, but it is usually between 5 and 10 per cent of the sale price.

Some prices in the Regent Street store at its launch yesterday were even higher than on J Crew’s UK website. A dress from the shop’s Collection range was £450 in store but £375 online – or $375 (£234) from the US site.

Yesterday shoppers who queued to be first into the London store were angry to discover they had paid over the odds. American schoolteacher Daphne Shoesmith, 48, had visited hoping there would be UK-exclusive lines but was horrified by the prices.

British shoppers were upset to find that they were being charged more than their U.S. counterparts

‘It’s shocking that it’s cheaper in the States,’ she said. ‘I’m going to return the shoes I bought and get some when I get back if it’s less expensive.’

One shopper wrote on Twitter: ‘J Crew kids is adorable but same price in £ as it is in $ is a no go for me!’

While another said: ‘J Crew looking nice on Regent Street. Price hike from the States a bit cheeky though.’

But the company defended the prices, saying they reflected the ‘materials and craftsmanship involved’ and the levels of taxes, duties and operational charges.

A spokesman said: ‘It is an inescapable fact that these costs in the UK are significantly higher than in the US. There are not many products that don’t vary in price from country to country. It is simply a fact of life.’

'Party dressing should never be head-to-toe shine and sparkle. If
 you're wearing a jewelled top, then maybe wear it with a menswear 
trouser and a loafer. Things that play off each other, instead of 
matching up, create a fun mood.

'I like the tweaking the idea of how something should be; wearing sparkles during the day, or a sweatshirt during the evening, or pairing a man's trouser with a feminine blouse.

'I like to twist the rules and to allow for that unexpected touch.

'I like things to feel a touch unfinished; sweatpants with heels, or tennis shoes with a trouser. Those things are important.'
