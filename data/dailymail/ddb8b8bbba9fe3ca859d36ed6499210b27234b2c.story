 

The intercepted phone calls of an alleged Australian terrorist recruiter, who is charged with helping young people join jihadist networks in Syria, have been heard in court.

Sydney man Hamdi Alqudsi allegedly acted as the liaison man and advisor between Australia's most senior Islamic State leader, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, and the would-be terrorists and organised travel, hotel accommodation, different overseas currencies, security, a Syrian contact and 'general encouragement and support', according to the police facts in the case.

In alleged phone calls between the two men heard in court on Friday, Baryalei - who is thought to now be dead - told Alqudsi of his experiences on the front line and claimed he was almost hit by a bullet.

Alleged Syrian recruiter: Hamdi Alqudsi (pictured on Tuesday outside a court in central Sydney) is charged with seven counts of recruiting the men to enter 'into a foreign state, namely Syria, with intent to engage in hostile activity in Syria, in particular, engaging in armed hostilities in Syria'

The federal prosecutors in the committal hearing against Alqudsi, who faces seven charges of conscripting Australians to join ISIS or other groups in Syria’s civil war, say they have 'overwhelming' evidence of Alqudsi recruiting and instructing young Australian men to go and fight in Syria. 

The prosecutor tendered more than 100 pages of phone tap records as part of a case against him, at Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney.

The prosecutor said Alqudsi had organised for the men to go to 'a particular part of Turkey which was known as the place where the fighters go to'.

In one text message, Alqudsi and one of the recruits wrote about 'getting the green light' for the trip into Syria.

Despite a statement by Mr Alqudsi's lawyer, Zali Burrows, that the 39-year-old could not be identified as the speaker or texter recruiting the would-be fighters, the prosecution had declared in one text and a telephone call his own name.

'He says "I am Hamdi Alqudsi" and in one message 'write my name, Alqudsi".'

Alleged mastermind: Hamdi Alqudsi (pictured on Tuesday after appearing briefly in the Downing Centre Local Court in central Sydney) is, police claim, the chief recruiter in Australia of young men who want to go and fight in Syria against government forces with groups such as the extremists in ISIS

ISIS leader Baryalei left Australia on April 10 last year on a flight to Tokyo.

At 1am on June 22 last year federal police intercepted a call between Baryalei and Alqudsi, in which Baryalei explains he 'just got back yesterday after fighting a battle where five brothers were killed and a lot of brothers were injured'.

'They were trying to take a large stronghold, however they encountered difficulties due to a sniper wiping everyone out'

Baryalei was himself nearly killed 'as a bullet came so close to him that his ears were ringing from the noise of the bullet'.

Baryalei said he had watched a 'commander die right in front of his eyes' and described his fighters taking out two to three tanks. 

Death in Syria: Hamdi Alqudsi is accused of recruiting Tyler Casey (above, left), originally from Redcliffe, Queensland and former Australian infantry soldier, 22-year-old Caner Temel (right) to Syria where they were both killed in January, Temel shot in the head by a sniper, and Casey and his wife, Amira Karroum were reportedly lined up, shot, and their bodies dismembered

Soccer nut: Mehmet Biber, a 21-year-old Turkish-Australian from Merrylands, Sydney, who loved poetry and soccer, became radicalised and was then recruited allegedly by Hamdi Alqudsi and crossed the Turkish border into Syria, from where he has posted photographs of bloodied aid workers injured in fighting

On June 25 last year at 9.05pm, police intercepted another call in which Alqudsi in Sydney told Baryalei in Syria, 'four brothers coming this week, they are leaving Australia, going to try and get them by the weekend'.

Alqudsi named them as Abu Qaqa, 'the tall one' (Tyler Casey), Abu Moussa (Caner Temel) and Biber's 'best friend', Abu Abdul Malik (Mehmet Biber) and Abu Islam ' the Sudanese brother'.

'They are ready,' Alqudsi told Baryalei. 'They are going to all meet in Istanbul then they are going to come all the way to Hatay [the southern province of Turkey which borders Syria] so you need to let me know if you want to pick them up from Hatay airport or do you want them to go to a particular hotel.'

Alqudsi said 'the brothers' were 'crying, affected, none of them wanted to stay in this country one second. They are ready.'

Alqudsi said the men would pay cash for the trip, with one of them giving $4000 and $2000. 

Arrested boarding a plane: New Zealand-born Amin Mohamed (above), 23, from Lidcombe in Sydney's inner west, allegedly bought a mobile phone in a false name and made plans to travel to Syria via Turkey with Alqudsi's help. He was arrested while trying to board a plane in Brisbane last December and charged with preparing to engage in foreign hostile activities

Dangerous company: Renamed Yusf Ali and preaching (above) on Sydney streets, Tyler Casey was recruited, police allege, by Sydney suburban father and disability pensioner, Hamdi Alqudsi, and sent to Syria where he was shot and killed in the northern city of Aleppo within weeks of arriving 

Road to death: Tyler Casey, who took the Jihadi name Yusuf Ali, joined the Street Dawah project where he met recruitment middleman Mohamed Ali Baryalei and took Islam to Sydney streets (pictured, left) before flying to Syria with his wife, Amira Karroum, and dying in a rebel incursion.

On June 29, 2013 police intercepted a call at 5.59pm from Baryalei in Syria in which he told Alqudsi he had no intention of returning to Australia and he wanted to be a 'Shaheed' - an honor for Muslims who lay down their life for their religion or die fighting defending their faith.

He said if he did this, he would leave his wife in Turkey as he did not wish to take her into Syria.

Alqudsi said he was sending over another Australian recruit to Syria, Muhammed Abdul-Karim Musleh.

At 7.17pm on the same evening, Alqudsi called Baryalei's phone and spoke to a man called Khatab, from the Al Nusra front and they promised to Skype each other.

The next morning at 6.32am, Alqudsi called a different phone of Baryalei's, in which the latter said the extremist group he was associated with had split into two groups, Jabhat al Nusra and Dawla Islamieh who were 'mujahadeens as well man' and he wanted to join the second group.

Australian Federal Police say the second group is a branch of Al Qaida.

At 5.25pm on July 2 last year, Tyler Casey and Caner Temel called Alqudsi from Turkey saying the 'boys' had just arrived, the trip was good and they would soon fly south to Hatay.

Alqudsi told them what hotel to stay in, instructed them to stay out of sight, buy a new SIM card and change their money into Turkish, Syrian and American currency.

Alqudsi told the young men Baryalei would be waiting for them and to keep him updated.

At 3.39pm on July 3, Alqudsi spoke with Muhammed Musleh who said they were about to board a plane for Hatay. Aqudsi said Baryalei had already left the international border crossing between Syria and Turkey at Bab al-Hawa to pick them up.

Alqudsi has now been ordered to stand trial on seven charges of recruiting young men to fight with terrorist forces in Syria.
