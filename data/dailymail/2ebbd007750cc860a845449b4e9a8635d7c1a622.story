Tragic: Brendan Jordan, seven, was killed when a folding table fell on his head in the school gym

A seven-year-old boy has died after an 108-pound folding table fell out of a wall in school gym and struck him on the head.

Brendan Jordan, a third-grader at New Milford's Gibbs Elementary School in New Jersey, was playing soccer with other children at Berkley Street Elementary School on Wednesday evening when he neared a fold-down table and benches, which are stored in the wall.

It is not clear if the boy started touching the table, which is attached to two benches and flips vertically up into the wall for storage. Authorities do not know if it had been correctly locked.

The table fell and one of the benches, which is made of wood and steel, hit Brendan on the side of the head and he collapsed, theNorth Jersey Record reported.

The team's coach Bryan Mone, who is also a New Milford police officer, immediately ran to the boy and performed CPR as others contacted 911.

But the youngster was pronounced dead around 7.30 p.m. at Hackensack University Medical Center, according to Detective Lt. Frank Ramaci.

Ramaci called the death 'an unimaginable tragedy'.

The tables and benches are secured with a key but School Superintendent Michael Polizzi told The Record that he didn't know if it had been locked properly.

He said the tables have been in 'good working condition,' and the school has never had a problem with them since they were installed about 11 years ago. 

'It's a tremendous loss for all of us, a shock for the family especially,' Polizzi said. 'I can't imagine the void the family will feel.'

Brendan was part of the indoor soccer team and was practicing for his Sunday season opener with six other seven- and eight-year-old children when he was struck.

John Bigger, the recreation director for New Milford, said practices in the gym were suspended for a few days while it is inspected and he doesn't know if the team will play Sunday.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission warned in 2012 of the potential safety risk of the tables, saying it had received reports of several deaths and injuries in schools when the tables tipped over.

Contraption: The folding table was like the one pictured above. It is attached to two benches and folds up vertically into the wall. When the table fell, Brendan was hit by one of the 108-pound benches

It warned that most accidents happened during afterschool or during nonschool activities and warned schools to not allow children to move the tables or play with them.

Police from New Milford and the Bergen County Sheriff's Department crime scene investigation unit are looking into the boy's death. 

Grief counselors have been made available at both schools.

'Our hearts go out to Brendan's family who are dealing with this tragedy,' Ramaci said.
