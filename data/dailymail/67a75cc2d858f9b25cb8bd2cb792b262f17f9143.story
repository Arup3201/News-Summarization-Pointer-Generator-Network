Prisoners should be allowed access to computers and the internet despite the security risks because they are living in a technological ‘dark age’, it was claimed today.

Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick sparked controversy by calling for murderers, paedophiles and terrorists to be allowed to log on to websites.

He argued giving offenders the chance to surf the web would help with reintegration into society and reduce reoffending.

But critics said it was ‘barmy’ to give prisoners access to the internet where they could plan crimes, do drug deals, torment victims and log onto extremist websites.

Mr Hardwick said secure, controlled use of the internet could also transform education, family contact and resettlement in jails - making it less likely inmates would return to a life of crime after leaving jail

Mr Hardwick, who was embroiled in a war of words with ministers this month after claiming prison were overcrowded, spoke out at a conference on modernising justice in London.

He said secure, controlled use of the internet could also transform education, family contact and resettlement in jails – making it less likely inmates would return to a life of crime after leaving jail.

Greater internet access could assist prisoners in looking for jobs and studying for qualifications as well as for making practical arrangements prior to their release, he said.

Mr Hardwick said: ‘Like other risk management processes in a prison, prisoners’ access to new technologies and the internet needs to be based on risk assessment of the individual concerned and properly supervised.

‘I don’t think we can go on with prisons in a pre-internet dark age: inefficient and wasteful and leaving prisoners woefully unprepared for the world they will face on release.

‘Yes, there are security issues to be addressed, but the technology allows every key stroke to be monitored and access can be risk assessed.

‘There is a fear that a move in this direction will be seen as being soft on prisoners. But we can’t leave prisons in a time warp.’

Mr Hardwick said it was ‘relatively easy’ for prisoners to get hold of an illegal mobile phone in prison through which they could access the internet.

Only last month film footage taken on a mobile phone emerged showing a group of boys in a Young Offenders Institute kicking and punching fellow inmates in a sickening ritual.

Prison reform campaigners have pointed out that in Norway, all prisoners have access to the internet, even in their cells, with firewalls set up to ensure security.

A report last year found three-quarters of all governors of prisons in England and Wales who responded to a survey believed inmates should have controlled access to the internet.

But Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, said large numbers of prisoners had been convicted of crimes involving misuse of computers and the internet, such as paedophiles who downloaded sex abuse images and Islamist extremists.

He said: ‘Internet access would be another serious blow to the notion that prison is a place where criminals are finally punished.

‘This could do real damage to the fight against organised crime and it risks victims being intimidated and terrorised.

‘Surely prison guards have better things to do than stand over criminals watching them surf the internet.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Advances in technology can provide useful tools to aid rehabilitation in prison, however there are clear security risks in allowing prisoner’s access to the internet and public protection will always be our priority.’
