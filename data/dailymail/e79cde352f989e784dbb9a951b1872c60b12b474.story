Tragic: Kingsman Dave Shaw was shot while on patrol in Afghanistan's notorious Helmand Province

A Taliban bullet fired from half a mile away killed a soldier by 'pure fluke', an inquest has been told.

Kingsman Dave Shaw, 23, was shot on January 14 last year while on patrol supporting Afghan police in Lashkar Gah, capital of Afghanistan’s notorious Helmand Province.

Investigators were told the bullet that killed Kingsman Shaw, who was from Barrow in Cumbria, had already 'reached the end of its trajectory, with the coroner describing his death as 'terrible luck'.

Kingsman Shaw was killed shortly after his patrol arrived at Pupalzy Shak, a fortified checkpoint surrounded by large walls designed to withstand a direct hit from rocket propelled grenades.

The British troops had been at the checkpoint around one hour and 40 minutes when Taliban snipers opened fire from farmland to the north west.

The court heard how Kingsman Shaw was struck by a bullet that had 'reached the end of its trajectory' and dipped over the northern wall of the 160 square foot checkpoint.

South Cumbria coroner Ian Smith said: 'To say this is bad luck is an understatement, it is terrible.'

Major Mark McLellan, commanding officer of the patrol, told the court his men had arrived at the checkpoint at around 7.30am, and had seen no signs of enemy activity. 

Mr Smith asked: 'In due course did the prevailing conditions outside change; did something happen?'

Major McLellan replied: 'Yes, there was firing. A short burst of arms went over my head. I gave the order to 'stand to' and everyone got their kit on. Then a second burst came through.'

The court heard within one or two seconds of firing Kingsman Shaw and his colleague Sergeant Mark Stevens had both been hit.

He said: 'I saw Sergeant Stevens had been hit in the back. At that point I saw Kingsman Shaw put his hand up to his neck, and then the sergeant grabbed him and applied pressure.'

Major McLellan described the arc of the shot as 'pure fluke' and said there was no way a bullet could have penetrated the walls of the compound. 

The court heard that although Kingsman Shaw had removed his 25kg body armour after entering the checkpoint - a choice down to the individual soldier - it still would not have stopped the bullet.

Sergeant Stevens, whose body armour saved him from serious injury, said that after reeling under the impact of the bullet he saw Kingsman Shaw was in severe trouble.

He said: 'Kingsman Shaw was staring at me and he was pointing at his neck. 

'I realised he had been hit and I grabbed him and applied pressure straight away. Then he was taken to the ground... The medic reacted straight away.'

Army medic Lance Corporal Rachel Hughes broke down in tears as she told of her attempts to save Kingsman Shaw's life.

She said: 'One minute we were standing around chatting and then we were under fire. I reached around to grab my body armour and I saw David cupping his neck with his left hand.

'I blinked for a second and that’s when the Sergeant took him to the ground.'

Lance Corporal Hughes told the court how she applied pressure to stop the bleeding and administered a clotting agent.

She said Kingsman Shaw lost consciousness and stopped breathing twice before being 'brought back' with CPR.

After giving evidence Lance Corporal  Hughes was thanked by Kingsman Shaw’s sister, Sarah.

A report by forensic pathologist Dr Nicholas Alexander, read by Mr Smith, said: 'He died despite heroic attempts to save his life. It is a testament to his physical fitness and to the care he received that he survived as long as he did.'

Dr Alexander stated the cause of death was cerebral infarction, caused by a gunshot wound to the neck. 

Kingsman Shaw was airlifted to Camp Bastion after around 25 minutes, before being flown to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, where he died the following day.

Following the inquest Sergeant Stevens, 35, from Lancaster, said: 'He was passionate about his job, and he was a good lad. He was always one of the boys.'

Major McLellan said: 'He was a real character, and he had reached the point where other soldiers were starting to look up to him.'

Kingsman Shaw's dad David said: 'His colleagues reacted as you would expect, completely professionally.

'Hearing what happens brings home how unlucky it was. There was nothing anyone could have done.'

Sarah Shaw said: 'It is nice to know there is no-one to blame. The care he received gave us the chance to say goodbye.'

The inquest continues.
