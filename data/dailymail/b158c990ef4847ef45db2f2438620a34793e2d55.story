Two British backpackers had an amazing escape when a 50ft tree came crashing down on an Australian campsite - landing where their tent had just been.

Robert Costley and Peter Ashford, both, 25, pitched their tent under giant eucalyptus tree for nine days, but moved to a shadier spot to escape the searing 40C (104F) heat.

Just two hours later the pair said they heard a 'boom' at their campsite in the isolated town of Shepparton, in rural Victoria, as they slept on Wednesday morning.

The pair had been camping underneath this 50ft eucalyptus tree for nine days, but moved to a shadier spot because of 40C (104F) heat

However the pair said their brush with danger hadn't dampened their spirits.

Mr Ashford said: 'If it had hit the van it would have ruined our plans but we would have worked something out. As long as you have your health that's all that matters.'

Since the incident, the campers have become a local media sensation. Their story dominated the front page of the Shepparton News and they have since had visits from curious locals.

Mr Ashford said: 'We were really surprised to be honest; we didn't think it was a big deal but I guess it is for such a small town.'

Their story could have ended very differently had it not been for the heat.

Peter said: 'We had been walking round the town and were in agony because of the heat. Kind of like Kevin and Perry.

Luckily their van (pictured) also escaped unharmed so they will be able to continue their travels

The story made the front page of the local newspaper and they have since had residents come and speak to them about their lucky escape

'We had spent nine days in that one spot but due to the heatwave we moved to find shade. It's been 40C plus for a good few days.'

They were later told by a local woman that either the relentless heat or an infestation of white ants could have caused the tree to topple.

Mr Ashford said: 'A local lady said they call them widow makers. They hadn't seen anything as big as this tree fall on the site before.'

They now plan to spend nine days in the town picking fruit before heading for New South Wales.

Peter, originally from Whitchurch and Rob, originally from Llandaff North, met in Melbourne at the beginning of December. Previously, Peter had been travelling in East Asia having left Wales on November 5.
