At just 19, New Zealand's Brando Yelavich set off on a journey no one had ever embarked on before - to traverse the country's entire coastline.

Brando started his trek at Cape Reinga - the most northern tip of the North Island - in February 2013 and will end it there. He is about four months and 700km away from reaching his goal.

The now 20-year-old set off with a 50kg backpack that had everything he needed to survive on his trip and planned to live off the land - catching fish, wild birds and wild rabbits - as well as anything else he could get his hands on.

A New Zealand man has embarked on a trip to circumnavigate the country's entire coastline - which is more than 7,000km

He started at Cape Reinga - the most northern point of the North Island - in February 2013 and will end his trip there as well

Right now he is about three-quarters of the way to his final destination, making his way up east coast at Mission Bay near Auckland.

In the past 17 months, Brando has documented his 7000-plus-kilometre journey on the internet via Facebook, Instagram and his own website at www.wildboy.co.nz.

The collection of photographs, taken with Brando's mobile phone or GoPro, include snaps of him walking down endless-looking train tracks, posing in front of picturesque backdrops of mountainous terrain lifted straight out a Lord of the Rings film and exploring what lies beneath the surface of the coast's pristine waters.

Brando, who has struggled with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, dubs his epic adventure - where he has climbing, walking, running and swimming - as his version of conquering the world's tallest mountain, Mount Everest.

He is on his way up the east coast of the North Island at the moment and has about 700km and four months left to go

On his website, Brando said this adventure had been a dream for several years and it had taken him to some of the highest and lowest points of New Zealand

'I had wanted to circumnavigate the New Zealand coastline for several years - inspired by the movie, Into the Wild,' he wrote on his website.

'Because of not achieving at school as a result of ADHD and dyslexia, and not being able to get a decent job I decided to wipe the slate clean and do something great which helps others so I decided to support the Ronald McDonald House Charity (I have always loved kids) and carry out my epic adventure to circumnavigate the New Zealand coastline - over 7000km - living off the land, the sea and the kindness of others.'

Brando treks for six to ten hours a day and covers 15 to 35km. This works out to be about 100km a week.

Mr Yelavich's dad, Todd, told MailOnline Brando had first planned to run the distance but the challenging terrain meant his son had to ditch the idea.

'He’s obviously going up and down mountains along the coast because there aren’t any beaches for him to walk down – it’s all cliffs,' Todd said.

'At first, we didn’t think he was going to follow through with it but when he was four to six weeks out, it started looking like he was going to do it now.

'Once it became reality, we had to take it a lot more seriously,' Todd said with a laugh.

So far he has covered 6500km of his trip since he started and learned a lot more outdoor skills, according to Brando's dad, Todd

Brando calls the trip his 'Mount Everest' and is raising money for the Ronald McDonald House Charities

During the first few weeks of Brando's journey, Todd admitted the family worried a lot about his son, but as the year wore on they became less so.

Todd said Brando calls the family almost every day to touch base with them.

'He’s almost killed himself a couple of times falling down banks, but he’s got a lot more skills than when he started,' he said.

'He was pretty fit to start with, he’d been training for it.

'Everything he needs is in his pack. It weighed 50kg at the start and he weighs about 68kg, so the pack was nearly as heavy as he was.'

Brando hopes to raise NZ$20,000 for the Ronald McDonald House Charities, so far he has raised more than NZ$18,000. To donate to his cause, visit www.supportbrando.co.nz.

Brando hikes for six to 10 hours a day - which means he does 15 to 35 a day - and covers about 100km a week

The 20-year-old has been documenting his adventure with a mobile phone and GoPro on his website and social media sites

Brando originally wanted to run the distance but gave that up after he found out about the diffcult terrain
