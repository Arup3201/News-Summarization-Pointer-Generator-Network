Accidents in the hours of darkness on built up roads where there is street lighting have fallen by nearly a fifth

Lives are being put at risk because motorists are increasingly being ‘left in the dark’ by council bosses switching off street lights to save money, a damning report by the AA reveals.

The rise in unlit roads is posing an increasing danger to motorists, pedestrians and cyclists, it says highlighting how councils are creating early morning ‘blackouts’ as an economy measure.

It said accident rates on blacked-out town and city roads – particularly 40mph zones in bad weather - are getting ‘much worse’ and proving to be ‘a growing menace.’

Discontent is growing so much that the AA predicts a ‘blackout backlash’ at the next election as local residents protests against councils of all political hues.

The AA cited Government figures showing that over the past five years, general improvements in road safety has seen accidents in hours of darkness on built-up roads where there is street lighting fall by nearly a fifth (18.6per cent|) overall, and by a quarter (24per cent) in the wet, snow and ice.

But where street lights were off or not present, the reduction was just 12per cent overall and 16.7per cent in bad weather.

The AA added that the situation was worse on faster roads. Since 2008, night-time accidents on street-lit 40mph sections have dropped 24.1per cent overall and by nearly a third (30.4per cent) in wet, snow or icy conditions.

But accidents are down only 10.4per cent on both counts where street lights were off or not present.

The AA highlights that since 2009 there have been six fatalities that coroners have ‘partly or wholly blamed on the switching off of street lights.’

The AA report says: ‘Accident rates on unlit town and city roads continue to get worse. This winter, however, discontent with street-light blackouts threatens a backlash in next year’s elections.’

It notes; ‘Evidence is growing of a potential political backlash – particularly to the north and east of London.

‘Discontent with the street light switch-off has provided a rallying point for local political opposition, petitions, and e-petitions, such as the Government’ s website and the Right to Light campaign in Kent.’

The AA said the five worst councils for street lighting in this year's National Highways and Transport Network public satisfaction survey all operate a street light ‘blackout’ during the early hours of the morning.

Essex County Council was bottom of a league of 78 councils with a score of 45.1per cent. Hertfordshire County Council was second with 51.7per cent, followed by South Gloucestershire with 56.5per cent , Buckinghamshire County Council with 58per cent, Suffolk County Council with 58.7per cent, Cheshire East (58.9 per cent), Shropshire (59.5 per cent), Leicestershire (60 per cent), Hertforsdshire (61.8 per cent) and Torbay (61.9 per cent).

By contrast, Blackpool, which has fitted energy-saving LED street lights through a Community Lighting Partnership, topped the street-light satisfaction league with a score of 75.8per cent .

It is followed by Wakefield (73.9 per cent), Derby (73.4 per cent), Sunderland (73.2 per cent), Nottingham (73 per cent), Knowsley (72.7 per cent), Aberdeenshire (72.1 per cent), Middlesbrough72.0per cent), South Tyneside (72.0 per cent), and Darlington (71.3 per cent).

AA president Edmund King said: ‘New official road safety statistics show that accident rates on blacked-out town and city roads are not getting better. In fact, on 40mph roads, they are getting much worse - particularly in bad weather.

‘This is the type of road where most of the fatalities, for which coroners blamed street-light switch-offs as a contributory factor, happened.’

Mr King said: ‘You have to wonder if many councils fully appreciate the difficulties and concern their street light blackouts create for their electorates, particularly those who commute or drive early in the morning.

The AA report says ‘Accident rates on unlit town and city roads continue to get worse'

‘For instance, Hertfordshire County Council’s policy review found that the first and last trains of the day required travellers to walk to and from the station in the pitch black . Little wonder perhaps that counties on the outskirts of the capital, where workers have to get going very early or late to beat the rush, are seeing such a strong backlash.’

Mr King added: ‘We would ask that, as a priority, the lights go back on along 40mph or faster roads in built-up areas.

‘Crash investigators in inquests have consistently stated that drivers who keep to the speed limit on those roads have little or no chance of missing pedestrians that suddenly appear out of the dark.’

‘If not, with national and local elections looming, putting cost-savings before road safety hands political opponents a strong populist position to argue on the doorsteps

‘We will see if Mondeo Man and the bellwether electorate of Basildon make Essex the ‘heart of darkness’ in the electoral battle over councils switching off street lights.’

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Public safety is our first priority. The department provides advice to local authorities on factors they need to consider in managing street lighting, but they are best placed to decide exactly where it is needed.’
