Real Sociedad say David Moyes is their new manager, despite the Scot insisting he is 'slightly surprised' with the club's announcement with some finer details of the 18-month deal yet to be completed.

The 51-year-old Scot has thought long and hard about taking charge of a side struggling at the wrong end of Spain's La Liga, particularly when he knows the next job needs to be the right job after his brutal sacking at Manchester United in April.

When Phil Neville rejected the opportunity to join Moyes in Spain over the weekend, he looked even less likely to take the job. Moyes is still giving thought as to who he may bring with him to Spain in his backroom staff.

Moyes' reign at Old Trafford lasted just 10 months as the Scotsman failed to get the best out of his players

Saturday November 22 - Deportivo La Coruna (A) (17th in La Liga)

Sunday November 30 - Elche (H) (18th in La Liga)

Thursday December 4 - Real Oviedo (A) (3rd in Segunda B)

Sunday December 7 - Villarreal (A) (8th in La Liga)

Sunday December 14 - Athletic Bilbao (H) (11th in La Liga)

Neville was a member of his coaching staff during that difficult 10-month tenure at Old Trafford but apparently has no desire to uproot his family and move abroad.

But Moyes was given a tour of Real Sociedad's training ground and facilities on Friday and asked club president Jokin Aperribay for the weekend to think over the offer.

It was not an easy choice with financial resources so limited despite the fact that only last season Sociedad were competing in the Champions League.

The wage bill would not be comparable to most Premier League clubs and the cash available to bring in new players will demand much of Moyes in the transfer market.

But with opportunities limited in the Premier League and Moyes keen to start rebuilding a reputation damaged by the United experience, the lure of working abroad and playing against Barcelona and Real Madrid is looking to be too much.

Ex-West Brom and Real Betis boss Pepe Mel was also in the running to replace Jagoba Arrasate, but Moyes was reportedly Sociedad's first choice and Real confirmed the Scot's appointment late on Monday night.

Moyes' first game in charge is set to be the trip to promoted Deportivo La Coruna after the international break.

Moyes becomes the fourth British manager of the San Sebastian-based outfit, following in the footsteps of Englishman Harry Lowe and Welsh duo John Toshack and Chris Coleman.

Lowe was manager for five years from 1930 while Toshack has had three different stints in the hotseat, beginning in 1985 and then most recently in 2002.

Current Wales boss Coleman, meanwhile, was appointed on a three-year contract in July 2007 after Sociedad were relegated to the Segunda Division for the first time in 40 years.

Coleman resigned from his post in January 2008, citing a difference of ideas with new president Inaki Badiola, having led Sociedad up to fifth in the table and one point off the promotion places.

While in charge at Manchester United last season, Moyes twice faced Sociedad in the Champions League - winning at home and drawing away.

Manchester United 1-0 Real Sociedad (October 24, 2013)

An own goal from Ingo Martinez just two minutes into this Champions League tie at Old Trafford gave United a deserved victory - although they could and should have won by more. 

Sociedad went into the game without a point and Moyes' men ensured they did not get anything from the game - elevating United to the top of Group A.

Real Sociedad 0-0 Manchester United (November 6, 2013)

The return fixture was not as happy for Moyes as United were frustrated in San Sebastian.

Robin van Persie hit the post twice - including from the penalty spot - while Javier Hernandez endured a horrible miss. 

Controversy also took hold of Moyes' team, with Ashley Young appearing to dive to win the penalty before Marouane Fellaini was sent off for a late foul.

Sociedad's previous British managers

Horace Harold (Harry) Lowe, 1930-1935

Lowe was a centre half from Northwich in Cheshire who played for Northwich Victoria, Brighton and Hove Albion, Tottenham and Fulham in the first two decades of the 20th century.

He moved to Spain in 1930 and managed Real Sociedad for five season before leading Espanyol. He died in 1966.

John Toshack, 1985-1989/1991-1994/2001-2002

Welsh legend Toshack managed the club in three separate spells spanning three decades. He led Sociedad to the Copa del Rey in 1987, beating Atletico Madrid on penalties in the final.

He returned to San Sebastian after his season at Real Madrid and then again during the 2001-2002 season.

Chris Coleman, 2007-2008

After Toshack had recommended the job to him, Coleman joined Sociedad, then a second division club, in June 2007. He enjoyed success but fell out with newly-elected president Inaki Badiola and resigned in January 2008 with the club fifth in the table.
