The London home where singer Amy Winehouse died has today sold at auction for nearly £1million less than the original asking price.

The
late singer's period property was originally put on the market for £2.8
million but Amy's father Mitch decided to reduce the asking price and 
sell it at auction after being inundated with viewing requests by fans.

And the north London house, which has become an unofficial shrine to the singer, was today sold for just £1.9million.

Auction: Singer Amy Winehouse died from alcohol poisoning at the house in Camden, north London, which today sold for £1.9million - nearly one million less than the original asking price

Prime location: The large property overlooks London's Camden Square, where the singer lived before she passed away last July

The
house, which overlooks London's Camden Square, has become a much visited spot after the musician died from alcohol poisoning at the 
age of 27 last July. She was five times the drink drive limit.

After her death fans held vigils outside the the home to pay tribute to the star.

The property was bought by a couple in their 40s at auctioneers McHugh & Co at BAFTA members club in Piccadilly, central London.

The new owners, who were dressed casually in jeans and jumpers, declined to comment afterwards with the man saying: 'I’d rather not discuss it.'

Amy Winehouse’s father Mitch told of his sorrow at selling the house where the wayward star died, saying: 'We are very sorry to see it go.'

There was interest from four parties, including one phone bidder, after auctioneer Chris McHugh started the bidding at £1.7million.

He described the house in Camden Square, north London, as a ‘substantial property in beautiful condition.’

It is described in the catalogue as being of an ‘exceptionally high standard’ and situated ‘in a most sought after residential area.’

Legend: The family of Amy Winehouse struggled to sell the late singer's former home after being inundated with viewing requests from fans rather than genuine buyers

The four-storey, semi detached house has three bedrooms, large garden, underfloor heating and a music room with sound proofed walls.

Mr McHugh said the property also boasted a gym but added the equipment has since been removed.

It originally went on the market for £2.8million in May but failed to sell.

However it went for £1,980,000 after today’s tense 10-minute auction which the auctioneer said was ‘no price for this house’.

Amy’s family asked auctioneers not to promote the sale by revealing who had lived there.

They are also thought to have vetted potential buyers beforehand to ensure there were no time wasters.

The house is still surrounded by tributes 15 months after the 27-year-old died from alcohol poisoning.

It is thought would-be buyers were put off by the constant stream of fans and tourists gathering outside.

After the Rehab star’s death last summer there were plans to transform the property into the headquarters for the Amy Winehouse Foundation charity set up in her name, but this was shelved due to fears there would be constant attention from fans.

Amy was found dead in her flat by her live-in security guard on July 23 last year.

An inquest heard bottles of vodka were found in her bedroom and she had five times the legal drink-drive limit of alcohol in her blood.

But the troubled star, who battled drug addiction, was found to have no illegal substances in her body at the time she died and a coroner recorded a verdict of death by misadventure.

Since her death the five-times Grammy winner has gone on to become the bestselling artist of the 21st century with her 2006 album Back to Black.
