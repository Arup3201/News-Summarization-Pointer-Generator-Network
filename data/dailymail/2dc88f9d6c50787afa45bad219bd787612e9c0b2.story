'It is not only what he does in games so well but on a day-to-day basis. For me, Cristiano is the best. Messi is there too - after Cristiano, there is the Argentine.' 

But former Old Trafford star Ronaldo has competition for Hernandez's heart.

'My idol is Ronaldo Nazario de Lima, 'The Phenomenon',' continued the 26-year-old. 'I've never had the chance to meet him, so hopefully one day I can get a picture with him.'

The Brazilian Ronaldo spent five years at the Bernabeu, and Hernandez wants to follow suit.

'I was in the best team in Mexico (Chivas), the best team in England (United) and now I'm in the best team in the world,' he added.

'I must be professional, as this is a great opportunity, but I still belong to Manchester and do not know if I will have to go back.'
