The U.S. Air Force is reportedly so low on pilots that it is running its drone raids against ISIS on emergency staffing levels while hundreds quit from being overworked.

According to an internal memo from a top general, the extra strain on the military's fleet of Predator and Reaper drones  has pushed the air force beyond 'red line' staffing levels thanks to Pentagon demands for more raids on ISIS.

This in turn has caused fleet commanders to scoop up green recruits from flight school, which is now working at half capacity, according to a report in the Daily Beast.

'Not enough pilots': The Air Force is reportedly creaking under demands for more raids by drone aircraft, such as the MQ-9 Repaer pictured above in Iraq

Fight against ISIS: The increased demands are a consequences of the United States's air campaign against militants in the Middle East. Pictured is an explosion caused by air raids in Kobani, on the Turkey-Syria border

Flight school: Training programs to teach cadets, like those shown here, the knowledge needed to fly drone raids are reportedly running at just half capacity

According to the Beast, the drought at the bottom comes as more experienced drone pilots quit due to the demands of flying constant raids against the enemies of the United States.

Pilots have reportedly had leave canceled and been forced to miss training courses which would normally lead to promotions in order paper over the cracks in the low staffing levels.

The situation was revealed in a message reportedly from General Herbert J Carlisle, the head of Air Combat Command (ACC).

'Extremely concerned': The memo reportedly came from General Herbert J Carlisle, the head of Air Combat Command

The message, to Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh, says Carlisle is 'extremely concerned' by problems in the drone fleet, especially in light of Pentagon requests for even more operations.

He said that the air force is expected to field 260 drones every day in 65 CAPs (Combat Air Patrols) of four planes each.

The Air Force is supposed to have 10 pilots for each CAP, who would fly the craft, operate weapons and also gather and monitor intelligence - 650 overall.

The message explained that in emergencies they can get by with 553 pilots per day (8.5 per CAP) - but in reality they are running on no more than 520 pilots - a gap of 130.

He wrote: 'ACC squadrons are currently executing steady-state, day-to-day operations (65 CAPs) at less than an 8:1 crew-to-CAP ratio.

'This directly violates our red line for RPA [remotely piloted aircraft] manning and combat operations'.

The memo also dealt with the wider consequences of the extra pressure, which has reportedly cleaned out flight schools (Formal Training Units, or FTUs) and led to staff leaving.

It said: 'Long-term effects of this continued OPSTEMPO [pace of operations] are manifested in declining retention among MQ-1/9 [drone] pilots, FTU [flight school] manning at less than 50 per cent, and enterprise-wide pilot manning hovering at about 84 per cent.' 

An unnamed official told the Beast: 'It’s at the breaking point, and has been for a long time. What’s different now is that the band-aid fixes are no longer working.'

An Air Force spokesman told DailyMail.com it is 'mindful' of how the demands of its drone raids are affecting staff, and admitted keeping the raids together is a 'challenge'.

Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Karns said: 'In order to meet combatant commander requirements, and in response to SECDEF [Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel's] direction, the Air Force surged MQ-1/9 CAPs nine times in the last eight years, and has successfully sustained those operations to date.'

'We're mindful of the toll this has had on the force and recognize Airmen remain the service's most vital resource.

'Continued sustainment of surge operations will have potential long-term impacts on training, safety, retention, manning, sustainment, and combat capability.'

'Retention problem': The memo says that more experienced pilots are leaving the force too. Above is an image of a drone taken from Turkey during the raids on Kobani
