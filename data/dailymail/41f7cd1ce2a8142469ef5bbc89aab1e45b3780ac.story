An array of stunning girls walked the runway in the hope of winning a modelling contract in Rio de Janeiro yesterday.

The Jacare e Moda show was held in the Brazilian region of Jacarezinho and saw girls as well as some boys up to the age of 22 take part.

All participants in the contest, called 'the most beautiful among them', were from the north zone of Rio.

The community is one of many slums in Rio, and the fashion show in a favela helped raise awareness of the good the company is doing for the local area. 

The entry requirement for attendees was a 1kg donation of non-perishable food for people in need, and the winning participant won a sought-after modelling contract.

Jacare e Moda (Jacare's Fashion) is a fashion school and modelling agency that helps educate and empower locals who are interested in the fashion industry. 

It describes itself as a 'producer of fashion in the slums of North Zone of Rio de Janeiro' on its Facebook page.

Jacare e Moda also recently held a lecture with a local woman from the slums who has succeeded in fashion, named Gabi Monteiro, in which she helped encourage locals to be proud of their origin and conquer whatever they want. 

A local councillor recently assisted on one of their projects in the region, where he lived for 28 years.
