Six police officers are facing misconduct charges after a detective’s teenage daughter was murdered by a sex fiend - five years after he carried out an almost identical attack.

Jamie Reynolds, 23, of Wellington, Shropshire, became one of the youngest killers to be handed a whole-life sentence in Britain after he was jailed for murdering 17-year-old Georgia Williams.

He became the 50th person in the UK to be sentenced to life behind bars in December last year after luring the girl to his home near Telford under the pretence of a photo-shoot.

Reynolds hanged her from a noose before taking photographs of her dead body, which was found in woodland near Wrexham in North Wales, five days after she went missing on May 26, 2013.

But at his trial it emerged he was investigated for a similar attack on another girl aged 17 in 2008. He tried to strangle the girl after asking her to his home, where he promised to take pictures of her.

The girl managed to escape and complained to police. Reynolds was given a ‘final warning’ and counselling.

Two weeks later, Reynolds’s stepfather contacted the police and handed in indecent images of women onto which his stepson had superimposed nooses, but no action was taken.

Speaking out: Georgia’s mother Lynnette (right, with husband Steven), 53, revealed six serving officers from West Mercia Police have been served with misconduct notices into how they dealt with the 2008 attack

And in February last year - just three months before Georgia’s murder - Reynolds persuaded another girl back to his house and refused to let her out until she began to scream.

Today, Georgia’s mother Lynnette, 53, revealed six serving officers from West Mercia Police have been served with misconduct notices into how they dealt with the 2008 attack.

The letters summon the officers to interview by detectives from Devon and Cornwall Police under Operation Columbia, an independent probe into the force’s dealings with Reynolds after the attack.

She said: ‘I confirm that on September 4 officers from Devon and Cornwall police informed me six serving police officers from West Mercia Police had been served misconduct notices in relation to their involvement in the investigation of an incident involving the murderer Jamie Reynolds in 2008.

‘Due to restrictions that ordinary members of the public would not normally be placed under I will not make any further comment at this time, in the interest of fairness to the officers involved and the pursuit of true justice on behalf of our daughter Georgia and the victims involved.

‘We are disappointed in the lack of a statement and detail from Devon and Cornwall Police and for not being open and honest with us and the public as they said they would be from the beginning of the inquiry.’

Speaking earlier this year, she said: ‘In 2008, Reynolds mirrored an attack basically that he committed on Georgia in that, he lured a girl round on the pretext of helping him out with a project and then there was a violent attack where he attempted to strangle her.

‘Thankfully she managed to escape, but it has traumatised her and it has totally changed her life. As parents, we feel that had it been investigated properly, we wouldn’t be in this situation.’

Devon and Cornwall Police today confirmed that misconduct notices had been issued to the officers.

A force spokesman said: ‘Six serving police officers have been served with misconduct notices in relation to this ongoing investigation. The officers concerned have not been suspended at this time.’

Next month Reynolds is expected to appeal his full life sentence when the case is heard at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London.

2008: Jamie Reynolds, then 17, is reported to police after luring a girl back to his house with an offer of a photo shoot before trying to strangle her. He is let off with a caution.

Later, Reynolds' stepfather goes to the police with pictures from the boy's hard drive. They feature girls with nooses superimposed around their necks and pornographic images of a man raping and strangling a girl to death. No action is taken.

Sunday May 26, 2013: Georgia is last seen by her parents at 7.30pm as she leaves the family home in Wellington, Shropshire. She tells them she is going to stay with friends.

In fact she went to Reynolds' home where he persuaded her to climb onto a box and place her head in a noose for a picture, before kicking the box away and hanging her.

He then took several pictures of her dead body, both clothed and unclothed, before carrying out a sexual assault.

Tuesday May 28: Georgia is reported missing by her parents after it emerges she has not stayed with friends.

Police arrive in the morning to a semi-detached house in Avondale Road, Wellington, and, according to a neighbour, break down the door to get inside. Neighbours say a Jamie Reynolds lives at the address with his parents.

Wednesday May 29: Reynolds is arrested in a budget hotel in Glasgow city centre by officers from Police Scotland on suspicion of kidnapping Georgia.

They also seize a Toyota van which Reynolds used to transport Georgia's body to woodlands where he dumped it, before heading north.

CCTV will later show he visited an Odeon cinema in Wrexham while her body was still inside.

Thursday May 30: West Mercia Police say the suspect has been arrested on suspicion of murder following 'developments in the investigation'. They stress that Georgia has still not been found.

Friday May 31: Police confirm it came to light yesterday that Georgia died at an address in Wellington, Telford.

The body of a young female found in woodland on the Nant-y-Grath pass, in north Wales, is believed to be linked to Georgia's disappearance. It is later confirmed to be the teenager.

Jamie Reynolds, 22, is charged with her murder.

December 2: Reynolds pleads guilty to murder at Stafford Crown Court.

Mr Justice Wilkie remands Reynolds in custody until December 19 pending further psychiatric reports.

December 19: Reynolds is handed a full life sentence for Georgia's murder after the judge hears he had the potential to go on and become a serial killer. He is only the 50th person in British legal history to be given such a sentence.

In court it emerges that Reynolds began hunting for clips of women being strangled six years before the attack. When he was arrested police found 16,800 images and 72 videos of extreme pornography on his computer.

It is also revealed that he subscribed to the same 'snuff' website as Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, featuring videos of murder pornography.

April 2, 2014: Lynette Williams, Georgia's mother, blasts police for failing to properly investigate his earlier crime, saying their daughter's murder could have been prevented.
