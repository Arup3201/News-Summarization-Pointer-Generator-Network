Police are still hunting for a prominent trauma surgeon they believe shot his ex-girlfriend to death at point-blank range at the hospital where they both worked.

Timothy V. Jorden Jr, a 49-year-old former Army medic and weapons expert, has eluded authorities since the shooting at the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, New York on Wednesday morning.

The victim Jacqueline Wisniewski, 33, worked as a receptionist at the hospital and was described as a 'one-time girlfriend'. She has a young son and was training to be a nurse. 

Jorden allegedly lured his ex-girlfriend
to a stairwell in the hospital, where he then shot her multiple times 
at blank-point range in the head and upper body.

Witnesses reported hearing four shots just after 8am. Ms Wisniewski's body was found in a covered passageway connecting the Kidney Center and another wing of the hospital.

Friends of the woman, who was looking forward to celebrating her young son's graduation from pre-K on Thursday, told the Buffalo News that she had lived in fear of her ex-boyfriend.

'She told me, "I'm scared",' her friend, Heather Shipley, said. 'She said: "If anything happens to me, you know who did it".'

Shipley added that Wisniewski had lived with Jorden but left him as she believed he was having affairs with other women. When they broke up, he refused to move on.

Wisniewski said the surgeon had put a GPS tracking device in her car to keep track of her movements. After she discovered the device, she filed a police report, Shipley said.

On another occasion, he held her 
captive in her home for a day and a half, brandishing a knife, the 
friend said. He also once gave her a black eye, she said.

'He threatened to kill her a couple 
of times,' Shipley added. 'But I think in her mind she wouldn't believe 
it would actually happen.'

Wisniewski's boss at ECMC's Adolescent Psychiatric Unit, Dori R. Marshall, said the woman had told her she was in an abusive situation with a physician, but did not name him.

'Person of interest': Surgeon Timothy Jorden was said to have been suffering from emotional problems

The shooting prompted a four-hour 
lockdown of the hospital, as SWAT teams and K-9 units swarmed the campus
in an attempt to corner the killer.

Police believe Jorden, who they have 
named as a 'person of interest', could be 'special weapons trained' from
his time in the Army.

Authorities
blocked a road leading to Jorden's home in an isolated area of private 
Lake View residences near the Lake Erie shore.

Officers
obtained a warrant and used specialized robotic devices to 
enter and search the home. But hours later, they determined he was not inside.

SWAT team members in camouflage 
arrived in unmarked SUVs and say he may be armed and dangerous.

While many have described him as a popular surgeon, sources told the Buffalo News that he has recently suffered some emotional problems.

It is believed he had recently lost 75 pounds.

'He might have been having mental health issues,' a police official told the News. Another official suggested he might have 'some type of serious physical ailment that caused the drastic weight loss'.

Sources added that it appeared the man had been living in his office as food containers and dirty laundry were found in the ceiling.

Neighbours added that he appeared to start losing the weight around three months ago, and they saw him at the home less frequently.

Law enforcement: Authorities, who also swarmed Jorden's home, said the shooting was 'not a random act'

Police presence: Officers hand out photographs of Jorden, who is a 'person of interest' in the crime

Officials said as many as 400 patients and about half of the hospital's 2,000 employees were on the grounds at the time.

'The
SWAT Team is in control of the situation,' Buffalo police spokesman 
Michael J. DeGeorge said during a news conference after the shooting. 
'It is an active situation.'

The hospital also diverted emergency room patients to Buffalo General Hospital but most of the campus re-opened at 2 p.m.

'Normally this is very safe,' 
hospital volunteer Lois Peterson told the Buffalo News. 'I've 
volunteered here for 42 years. But this is tragic.'

Police described Jorden as a bald, 
black male, about 6ft 2 and 250 pounds, and showed his photograph at 
check points in the search for tips. Authorities also described the four vehicles - two GMC Sierra pickups, a Cadillac and a Chevrolet Cobalt - registered in his name.

After completing high school, Jorden 
joined the Army and served with the Army's Special Forces, as a weapons 
expert then as a medic. His military career spanned 18 years and he served in the Caribbean, Japan and Korea.

Patrol: Staff and patients were refused entry to the hospital over a four-hour period

He earned numerous medals including 
the Army Achievement Medal, Army Commendation Medal and Master Parachute
Badge Scuba Diver Badge Special Forces Tab, ABC reported.

Francisca Wellsbury, who was married to Jorden before they divorce, told ABC she was shocked her former husband was the suspect.

'We've lived separate lives for a long time,' Wellsbury, who lives on the West Coast, said. 'I'm just as shocked as anyone. It's traumatic.'

She added: 'This is not the person I knew. I wish he would seek help.'

Jorden has been licensed to practice 
medicine in New York since 2002 and treats patients at the medical 
center and other major hospitals in the area.

'I've wanted to be a doctor since early in my military career as a medic,' Jorden told the Buffalo News in a 1996 profile, which featured pictures of his wife and their son.

He received his certification from 
the American Board of Surgery in 2004. There are no legal actions 
against his license and he has no criminal background.
