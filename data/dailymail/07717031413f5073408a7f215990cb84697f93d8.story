When a series of customers made questionable comments about their Italian restaurant, the owners decided to hit back - and responded with a series of hilarious comebacks in broken English.

Cinzia, 46, and Maurizio Bocchi, 47, who run a quaint village eatery in Gisburn, Lancashire, criticised guests for being ‘stupid’, ‘insignificant’ and having ‘a head with the same content of an airball’.

And when a patron at the award-winning La Locanda called Mrs Bocchi ‘aggressive’ on TripAdvisor, furious Mr Bocchi responded to say the reviewer’s wife was 'capable to argue with her own shadow’.

Hitting back: Cinzia, 46, and Maurizio Bocchi, 47, who run La Locanda Ristorante Italiano & Wine Bar in Gisburn, Lancashire, are responding to critics with a tirade of offensive insults on TripAdvisor and Facebook

Taking a stand: They have even told customers who dare to criticise their award-winning village restaurant in Lancashire - where main courses cost up to £18 - that they are 'stupid', 'insignificant' and 'racist'

One review on TripAdvisor, called 'Give this one a miss', said: 'Went here in July and came across a very rude, mad Italian mamma who wouldn't know customer service if it hit her in the face.'

In response, Mr Bocchi said: ‘To respond it will not be the Italian mamma but the husband and chef patron. I found your review very rude and with a prominent racist note.

‘I can quite understand your way of telling things because your brain level will not support any better language and manners.’

In another review, one customer asked if ‘mad’ Mrs Bocchi was related to fiery Italian former footballer and manager Paolo Di Canio. Mr Bocchi then launched a tirade of abuse back at the diner.

Response: One review on TripAdvisor, called 'Give this one a miss', said: 'Went here in July and came across a very rude, mad Italian mamma who wouldn't know customer service if it hit her in the face'

It read, in broken English: ‘Dear mister, thank you for your review always welcome stupid comment (bit of a laugh do not harm anybody). You are very offensive. But I quite understandable from a person within the head having the same content of a ball (AIR).’

'We give an answer to the people who complain for the sake of it. I have been ironic and put in a bit of fun to my responses. You can’t please everyone in this business'

Maurizio Bocchi

‘Of course the lady is mad because she welcome you, explain the menu, offer the drinks, all in a very polite manners, that’s why she is mad... being gentle with an insignificant person like you.’

The reviewer, who warned others to ‘stay away’ and complained that it was ‘the only Italian I’ve ever frequented that doesn’t serve pizza’, was also giving a dressing down by the incensed owner.

His response continued: ‘Now the serious bit; ristorante = not pizza available, pizzeria = pizza is the main dish, ristorante e pizzeria = pizza with an extensive menu.

Complaint: One customer asked if 'mad' Mrs Bocchi was related to Italian former footballer Paolo Di Canio

Lengthy reply: The reviewer, who warned others to 'stay away' and complained that it was 'the only Italian I've ever frequented that doesn't serve pizza', was giving a dressing down by the incensed owner.

‘Hope the lesson of today is useful and because you have been a good boy NO homework for today.’

And in a further attack in response to a review entitled ‘avoid like the plague’ by a former professional restaurant reviewer, the chef said: ‘As an ex restaurant reviewer you should know what a mise en place is and have a correct knowledge between a starter and a main course.

'The criticisms can be constructive if they are right - but when they are not, we point out their mistakes. I know everything that happens in this restaurant'

Cinzia Bocchi

‘I strongly think the person to avoid are you too or even better keep your wife away from any person because I am sure she will be capable to argue with her own shadow. Hope your sad life get better (if not for you for the people they come across you and your wife).’

The couple opened the restaurant in 2003 with the aim to give the customers a ‘real taste of traditional Italian cuisine.’

The family-run business says it has ‘the ideal marriage between the highest quality Italian producers and the best of local suppliers, to create authentic Italian cuisine in the heart of Ribble Valley.’

Unimpressed: One review entitled 'avoid like the plague' was by a former professional restaurant reviewer

Opinion: The chef said that the man should 'have a correct knowledge between a starter and a main course'

Mr Bocchi said his online responses are just ‘honest’, adding that he didn’t think TripAdvisor was the best way to measure a business.

He said: ‘I always reply to the reviews on TripAdvisor because I want whoever gives a bad review to know when they have made a mistake. A couple of customers have responded and agreed.

‘We give an answer to the people who complain for the sake of it. I have been ironic and put in a bit of fun to my responses. You can’t please everyone in this business.’

His wife added: ‘We have been attacked on Tripadvisor. The criticisms can be constructive if they are right - but when they are not, we point out their mistakes. I know everything that happens in this restaurant.

‘I keep a record of everything. We are a small business. The majority of reviews are positive but when we get negative ones and they are wrong, they don’t expect us to answer back.’
