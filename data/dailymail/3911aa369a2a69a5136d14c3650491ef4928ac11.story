Jose Mourinho is the latest sporting luminary to take on the ice bucket challenge, which is taking social media by storm.

The Chelsea boss was nominated by Blues striker Didier Drogba, and stepped up to the mark.

The challenge - getting soaked with a chilly mixture of freezing water and ice cubes - is to raise awareness of neurodegenerative illness ALS - better known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

Mourinho's chosen targets to complete the task within the next 24 hours are a bit of surprise.

His daughter Matilde was an obvious choice, but the Portuguese boss looked outside football for his other two nominations.

Canadian rock star Bryan Adams and British actor James McAvoy - both of whom Mourinho describes as his friends - were each called out before the Chelsea boss let out a scream as he was drenched with the cold water.

Up to the challenge? Legendary musician Bryan Adams has also been nominated by Mourinho

Mourinho became friendly with McAvoy during the Soccer Aid 2014 match, when the Chelsea Boss managed the Scottish actor, who was playing for Mourinho's Rest of the World team.

The Chelsea manager is known to be a big fan of Adams so he'll be hoping that the Canadian, along with McAvoy and his daughter are up to the challenge.
