A Florida man is facing possible prison time for being bitten by a snake.

Eddie Chamberlain, of Fort Myers, was jailed last year for 80 days on a breaking and entering charge.

Currently on probation, the 19-year-old was at his girlfriend's house in Cape Coral on July 23 when he saw a snake threatening a neighbors cat and her son, according to WTSP.

Chamberlain caught the snake and put in a fish tank.

Violated: Being bitten by a poisonous coral snake could land Eddie Chamberlain, 19, in prison for violating his probation

While handling the snake on Saturday, the animal bit him on the thumb.

'I've been bitten plenty of times,' Chamberlain told WTSP.

'Just not by a poisonous snake.'

Chamberlain said his arm started going numb 30 minutes after the bite and then another 30 minutes later he had trouble breathing.

So severe was the reaction, Chamberlain was taken to Lehigh Acres Regional Hospital, before being transferred toÂ  Lee Memorial Hospital, where he was injected with anti-venom.

He remained in hospital for three days.

The snake was later identified as a coral snake, which are extremely poisonous.

'I was freaking out,' his mom Dawn told WTSP.

However the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission may now decide to fine Chamberlain for keeping a venomous snake as a pet.

Deadly: Coral snakes are extremely venomous, and are among just six of the 44 native snake species in Florida that are considered poisonous

The fine would a violation of Chamberlain's parole.

State wildlife rules mandate a license and specific training to keep such a snake.

Chamberlain said that a judge told him that if he violates probation he could end up back in prison.

'He told me I could get 25 years in prison,' he said.

However Chamberlain is adamant the snake was not a pet.

'I saved the cat but almost lost my life,' he said.

'I kinda think I did the good thing.'

'It's kinda stupid that they're trying to (fine) me.'

Only six of Florida's 44 native snake species are venomous.

They are the eastern coral snake, the southern copperhead, the cottonmouth, the eastern diamondback rattlesnake, the timber rattlesnake, and the dusky pygmy rattlesnake.
