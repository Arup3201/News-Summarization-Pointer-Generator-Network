Millions of New Yorkers ride the subway every day, most of them not bothering to look one another in the eye as they shuffle by lost in thought.

A photo exhibit by Danny Lyon called 'Underground: 1966' that the MTA Arts & Design has installed at Atlantic Av-Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn, New York zooms in on the Subway riders of 1966, zooming in on ephemeral moments in an ever-changing city. It will be on display for one year.

According to MTA.com Lyons has had a long career as a photographer and filmmaker who documented the civil rights movement of 1962 in the South and was in a motorcycle gang in Chicago.

Lost in thought: A woman sits pensively on the subway,clutching her purse in front of one of the underground maps 

Just another day: Two women sit side by side looking off to a corner of the train each sporting 1960s style jackets 

Sailor: This sailor gazes into the camera as he waits for the New York City Subway to take him to his desired destination 

Lyon made his way back to New York in 1966 as his mother advised him. 'If you’re bored, just talk to someone on the subway,' she told him.

Lyons took that advice to heart and made it the subject of his art.

'Brooklyn is changing very rapidly and so many newcomers have joined long-time residents among the 40,000 people who use the Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr station every day. ‘Underground: 1966’ is a great opportunity to show them how it used to be, and to show off the work of a ground-breaking photographer who was born in Brooklyn,' said Lester Burg, Senior Manager of MTA Arts & Design.

'“Underground: 1966” comprises eight large-scale photographs that show a lone woman standing on the platform; two women bundled up from the elements; a dapper reveller; a lone sailor, and two teenagers waiting on an elevated platform,' says the MTA website.

The standstills evoke a feeling that each subject is lost in thought as they travel through the city of millions.

'There is something about taking the work to where the people are that makes for a different viewer connection from visiting a museum to see an exhibit,' said Lyon who expressed his delight with the fact his work can be viewed on the subway.

To capture the New York moments, Lyon used a Roliflex camera with Kodak safety film slides.

He didn't use a tripod during long exposures so some of the figures appear ghostlike in nature.

MTA Arts & Design’s light box project exhibits photography at four locations within the transit system.

Vintage look: The trains of 1966 have a vintage feel when compared to the modern Subway system in New York today

Staples of the past: The photograph shows the types of machines that lined the subway back in 1966 and one could get their horoscope 

Peekaboo:Two young boys ride the New York Subway in 1966 just a few years after the Civil Rights movement 

Read the sign: A woman leans against a sign that reads, 'Do not stand here' back in 1966 on a New York Subway platform
