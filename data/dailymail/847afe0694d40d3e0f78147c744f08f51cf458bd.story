Good thing he wasn't around: Elwyn Fossedal, 81, insisted if he were in the same room as President Obama that he would shoot him dead

An 81-year-old ‘birther’ from Wisconsin has been arrested for threatening the life of President Barack Obama.

Elwyn Fossedal, of Madison, made the threat last month at a local post office and repeated it several times, including while being interviewed by Secret Service agents.

‘If President Obama was here I would shoot him right there and kill him right now,’ Mr Fossedal said, according to an affidavit on the Smoking Gun.

Horrified bystanders notified police of the threat, they passed the information on to a local Secret Service field office.

Agents interviewed Mr Fossedal the day after he made the threat and he refused to back down.

Mr Fossedal ‘would not recant [the threat] made towards the President and repeated the threat using different words,’ the affidavit reads.

‘He also made a number of additional threats towards the President,’ the document continued.

Agents looking into the potentially dangerous man’s background discovered that his wife of 57 years recently passed away.

‘He is displacing his grief of her loss with anger,’ said the affidavit.

Agents also discovered Mr Fossedal is very familiar with firearms, and deemed him a threat.

The threatening man also posted a video to his Facebook account arguing to 'save our 2nd Amendment!' The Second Amendment provides Americans the right to bear arms.

The agency determined he is a ‘birther’ after disseminating his online activity, including calling for the President’s impeachment and declaring ‘we need to throw the Muslim in the White House, OUT,’ the Smoking Gun noted.

He also resigned from Lions Club International over religious differences stemming from the group’s move into Muslim countries.

The retiree faces as many as five years in prison if convicted, it is not clear when his next court date is.
