A pensioner died from an allergic reaction to penicillin because part of his medical notes had been covered with a Post-it-note, an inquest has heard.

John Dudding, 80, from Plymouth, Devon, was suffering from 'dizziness' and went to hospital so he could get better for his daughter's wedding.

But doctors wrongly prescribed him with an antibiotic containing penicillin, because the sticky yellow paper was covering the allergy section of his chart.

Tragically, he died three days after taking the drug at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and a week before his daughter, Kim Tremaine, walked down the aisle.

Tragedy: John Dudding, 80, pictured on Saunton Sands beach in North Devon with his daughter Kim Tremaine, died after he had an allergic reaction to penicillin. He died a week before she was due to get married

The inquest in Plymouth heard on Tuesday that Dr Nicholas Batten, who prescribed the drug, was not aware at the time that the patient was allergic to penicillin.

Mrs Tremaine told the hearing that her father had previously suffered from bowel cancer 
and lymphoma, but believed he was getting better.

She said: 'I 
thought he had improved that much that I was going to leave.

‘Nurse Joseph came and injected into the catheter in his hand. As soon as it was administered she left.

‘Dad started shaking and I had my hand on his heart and chest asking if he was ok.'

Ms
 Tremaine and her family waited outside while doctors treated her 
father, she saw him later and said, ‘His face was really red and swollen
 to a point where he didn’t look like my dad at all.

Ms
 Tremaine thanked the nurse who looked after her father the evening 
after the drug was administered, and said: ‘She was out guardian angel 
in our darkest time.’

Doctors at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon, did not see the allergy information on his medical chart because it was covered by a Post-it note

Dr Batten, who was in the first of 
three years of specialist medical training at the time of the incident, 
was instructed by Dr Elizabeth Howeson, to prescribe an antibiotic.

He said he chose the drug because of protocols concerned with hospital-acquired chest infections and MRSA.

...‘Dad started shaking and I had my hand on his heart and chest asking if he was ok'

He told the court: ‘We had been through the notes of his admission and past medical history.

‘In there would have been record of his allergy. That may not have been on my mind, I may have been focusing on the neurological problem.

‘I do recall when I lifted it there was a Post-it note on the drug chart. It almost becomes an automatic reaction to look at the allergy section and sadly on that day I don’t think I looked under the Post-it note.’

Nurse Shirley Joseph, who injected Mr Dudding with the drug, said she checked for allergies but didn’t see the warning because of the note.

Both doctors said lessons had been learned from the incident.

In an emotional statement, Dr Howeson said: 'It has made me much more careful to double check observation charts and drug charts.

Missed: Mr Dudding died three days after taking the drug. An inquest in Plymouth heard how Mr Dudding had gone to hospital so he could be healthy for his daughter's wedding

‘We rely on the fact our junior 
doctors do their job well and there’s no harm having someone else check 
and the more people check the less problems will occur.’

Dr
 Charles Keene, from Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, performed a 
post-mortem examination and said he found a cancerous tumour in Mr 
Dudding’s lung, evidence of bronchopneumonia, coronary artery disease 
and the spread of cancer to the kidneys.

Dr Martin Mansell, who specialises in kidney problems, also gave evidence and said: 'If I was involved in Mr Dudding’s care I would have said that the outlook was hopeless probably on February 19 early on.

‘I would have thought there was something terrible going on in the brain. I would have said it would be a miracle for that patient to survive.'

The inquest heard evidence from Mr Dudding’s son, John, and daughter Kimberley Tremaine.

The hearing continues.
