Electrocuted: Emma Shaw was killed as she mopped up a water leak from a boiler in her flat. Prosecutors have decided not to bring manslaughter charges against the workmen who installed the appliance

Relatives of a young mother who was electrocuted while mopping up water from a faulty boiler have spoken of their fury after prosecutors decided not to bring manslaughter charges against the bungling workmen who installed the appliance.

An inquest jury ruled that Emma Shaw, 22, was unlawfully killed when she suffered a fatal electric shock in her flat in West Bromwich, West Midlands, in December 2007.

But the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says there is 'insufficient evidence' to charge Anchor Electrical and Building Services, the company which let an unqualified electrician safety inspect Miss Shaw's home.

Prosecutors reached the decision despite jurors at Miss Shaw's inquest hearing of a 'catalogue of mistakes' by the firm, which has been wound up since the tragedy.

Miss Shaw's parents today revealed that they were considering bringing a private prosecution, and the Health and Safety Executive is still to decide whether it will take action.

Miss Shaw's mother, Dianne Potter, said her daughter had been denied justice.

'I’m disgusted,' Ms Potter added. 'Have we come all this way for it to finish like this?'

Miss Shaw's father, Paul Shaw, said: 'We feel dumbstruck. Do we bring a private prosecution? That’s a question to raise with our solicitor.

'We had what we considered a positive result at the inquest and thought there may be sufficient evidence for a criminal case.'

Miss Shaw's boyfriend Andy Cross, who found her body and is now raising their six-year-old son Brayden alone, said: 'The jury said it was unlawful killing which, to me, means someone was to blame.

'How can the CPS turn down the case when the coroner’s court said something was not right?'

During a seven-day inquest last December, jurors heard there had been a catologue of mistakes by the company that wired Miss Shaw's flat.

Testing was 'not carried out to a professional standard, if at all', the inquest was told.

Jurors heard there had been a 
'failure by the company to assess the capabilities of their workforce 
and constantly monitor their development' and a 'failure to comply with 
their health and safety standards'.

The inquest heard that Anchor could not explain why an employee who was not a fully-qualified electrician was left alone in the flat to carry out a safety inspection of electrical work.

In a statement, the CPS said: 'Following the unlawful killing verdict at the inquest into the death of Emma Shaw, West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service has conducted a full review of the original decision not to charge six suspects with the offence of manslaughter.

'The review is now complete and, with the benefit of advice from a leading specialist QC, we have decided there remains insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any suspect for the offence of manslaughter.

'The CPS has informed the Health and Safety Executive of its decision. HSE is likely to consider whether it is appropriate to bring any prosecutions under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.'

The HSE confirmed it was 'liaising with the CPS' over the case.

Review: A letter from the CPS to Miss Shaw's mother confirms that prosecutors believe there is 'insufficient evidence' to bring manslaughter charges

Conclusion: On the second page, the author of the letter acknowledges that the decision 'may come as a disappointment' to Miss Shaw's family
