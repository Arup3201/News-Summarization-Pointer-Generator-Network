'I know how hard people work just to make ends meet': Billionaire Jeff Greene, 60, and wife Mei Sze

A  billionaire hedge fund manager who sparked outrage for telling Americans to lower their expectations so they have 'less things' in life now says he was misquoted.

Jeff Greene also says he wants to continue the fight against inequality - even if it means being the 'poster boy for the insensitive upper class'.

Greene, a self-made businessman worth around $3 billion, spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, reportedly saying he believes people in the United States need to stop aiming so high and start living with less.

'America's lifestyle expectations are far too high and need to be adjusted so we have less things and a smaller, better existence,' he was quoted in an interview with Bloomberg.

The 60-year-old, who ran for the Democratic Senate nomination in Florida in 2010, was lambasted not just for his words, but for flying into the Swiss conference on a private jet, with his 19-year younger wife, Mei Sze, children and two nannies.

Now, in trying to clear up the debacle in a piece for CNN, the investment banker says 'the quote was credited to me and I know that I never said it'.

Greene goes on to defend himself and the wealthy against suggestions they only care about themselves and their money.

'But what bothered me most in all this was how this whole incident fed a narrative that the wealthy are detached, that they just don't care.

'In fact, the people I spoke with while I was (at the World Economic Forum) were without exception concerned about the struggles of individuals and families affected by globalization, disruptive technologies, and most of all the long-term challenge of economic inequality.

'I can say these things from experience - I have often talked about this issue, calling for policies to bolster the middle class and even expressing support for increasing taxes on the wealthy.

'As a guy who grew up in middle class Worcester, Massachusetts, I know how hard people work just to make ends meet and how years of stalled income growth can drain people of their hope and optimism.

'I saw it myself growing up when my father lost his business.

'As a result of what I have seen and experienced growing up and as a businessman I have continued to the problem of inequality many times and voiced support for education, investment in infrastructure, and economic policies to aid those who are middle class and those who aspire to be.'

Greene goes on to say that 'elected leaders' are not doing enough to prepare for future changes in industry that will lead to job busts.

He references the introduction of cab-hailing app Uber and the effect it has had on car services and cab drivers. He also cites developments like 3D printing as something that will put many people out of work in the future.

'These developments pose a profound challenge to the United States, and we'll need a comprehensive strategy that draws on the best ideas available to ensure everyone has a chance to succeed,' Green wrote in the CNN op-ed.

Controversial: Property developer and investor Jeff Greene was quoted saying America should rethink its high lifestyle expectations after arriving by private jet to Switzerland, but says he never made the comments

'Unfortunately, the policies we need will not emerge from a media-driven debate that starts with the premise that uncaring rich guys aren't concerned about others.

'We are going to have to trust each other, drop our assumptions, and make a commitment to open and accurate debate.

'I'm willing to do so, even at the risk of being cast, unfairly, as the poster boy for the insensitive upper class.'

Greene made his fortune betting against sub-prime mortgage securities.

He says he manages about $2 billion in financial investments, more than $750 million in real estate and at least $1.5 billion in assorted property development projects.

And he does it all on his own, without investors or partners, he says.

Greene continued: 'Our economy is in deep trouble.'

'We need to be honest with ourselves.

'We've had a realistic level of job destruction, and those jobs aren't coming back.'

Greene owns a $195 million palace in Beverly Hills, which has 23 bathrooms and a rotating dance floor and considered the most expensive house ever listed for sale in the United States. 

In 2013, Greene spoke of owning a $2 million Cessna Caravan seaplane that he said saved him valuable time commuting between his homes in Palm Beach, Florida, and the Hamptons and New York City, where he conducts much of his business. 

He told The Real Deal that the plane cut a journey of more than three hours to just 35 minutes, employing two full-time pilots.

He said he and his wife Mei Sze Chan used it around 40 to 50 hours a month for themselves and friends.

Mr Greene, who is ranked the world's 687th richest man by Forbes, said he was inspired to buy the plane after musician Jimmy Buffett was landing his own plane on the same bay near his home.
