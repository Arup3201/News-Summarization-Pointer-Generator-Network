A cowardly bear was caught running from a dog in hilarious pictures taken this week.

The brave pooch, named Rooster, chased off the craven bear Friday during an aversion training program sponsored by the state of Nevada.

Bear aversion training has been credited with saving almost 400 bears, according to the state.

Though the bear was tranquilized earlier in the day, all credit goes to Rooster.

Rooster is a Karelian Bear Dog, according to the Nevada Department of Wildlife. Karelian Bear Dogs were originally bred by farmers and hunters in Finland and Russia specifically for the task of handling bears.

‘Their job is to chase the bear, bark in its face and making it run away or climb a tree,’ the agency says.

They grow to be only 40 – 60 pounds, but have ‘an instinct for handling bears safely,’ according to the DOW.

The training program has been run by the state since the late 1990s, but Rooster joined in 2005, quickly becoming the leader of the team, according to the DOW.

‘His tenacity, quickness and fearless personality kept him from getting injured during over 300 bear encounters,’ the agency boasts.

Rooster and Stryker, another Karelian Bear Dog on the DOW roster, were featured on a National Geographic special called Animal Extractors.
