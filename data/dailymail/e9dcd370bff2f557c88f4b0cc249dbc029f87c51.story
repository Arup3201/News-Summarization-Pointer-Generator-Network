Lewis Hamilton has been criticised on Twitter for posting and then deleting a video of himself driving at speed on a public road.

Hamilton was enjoying some time off in Monaco as he took his Pagani Zonda out for a spin before posting the clip online.

The Mercedes driver wrote: 'Launch control!! This is one of my babies, I love driving this car. Guess the car?! #0-100 #realquick #boss.'

The tweet was deleted shortly afterwards, but many of Hamilton's 2.4million followers had already seen the clip and some were far from impressed.

One fan tweeted: 'Think you should auction it for a road safety charity after irresponsible behaviour in the video you posted.'

Although Hamilton claimed his Zonda can do 0-100kph in his tweet, there is no suggestion that the 29-year-old was breaking any laws during the 15-second clip.

Hamilton's life in the fast line will continue this weekend as the English driver looks to increase his three-point lead on Nico Rosberg in the Japanese Grand Prix.

Speaking ahead of the race, Hamilton believes he has matured since the last time he tasted Formula One title success.

'Back then it was all instinct, I think my maturity was at a very early stage and I probably think that is the biggest change and hopefully I will keep getting more and more mature.

'Also my work ethic. My work ethic is a lot better, more serious and more understanding - it seems to be working well for me.

Hamilton leads the pack into the first corner at the Singapore Grand Prix. He went on to claim victory 

'This has been the most consistent and best-performing season I have had in Formula One and I want to continue that for many, many years - it is like building blocks, I just need to keep working on it.

'You don't focus on the past but you don't forget about it. Ultimately what has happened in the past has defined today - it has shaped me personally, mentally and psychically into who I am today.

'Particularly this year, those experiences I have had I know this weekend will be a tough weekend, the next five could all be tough weekends, there is all the possibilities in the world I could be facing the toughest time of my life - but it is also possible it could be the greatest time of my life.'
