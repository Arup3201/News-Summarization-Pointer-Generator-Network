Forget X-Boxes, Furbies, that mega Lego city coast guard patrol boat and even Monster High dolls.

The fastest-selling toy globally this year is the Robo Fish, with 15 million sold so far, and manufacturers Zuru are having to produce 70,000 of the little swimmers every day to keep up with demand.

The brightly coloured aquatic robot toys spring to life and swim around realistically as soon as they are dropped into water, and deactivate as soon as they are removed and dried off, ready for their next paddle.

The Robo Fish costs £9.99 per piece and £19.99 for the fish bowl, including one fish

Makers of the Robo Fish, Zuru, are manufacturing 70,000 every day to keep up with demand, and have so far sold 15 million

The fish has been a top five-selling toy in over 40 countries and has won multiple awards, including a coveted place on this year's Dream Toys list.

The fish, predicted to be a top seller this Christmas, is priced at £9.99 RRP a piece, with four Finding Nemo-inspired clownfish and four sharks to collect. The fish bown costs £19.99 RRP and comes with a fish.

And in some places it's being used as more than just a toy. Swimming instructor Caroline Watson, of Sevenoaks, Kent, is helping her young charges learn to swim with the help of the robotic fish.

Caroline has started using the innovative toy during her pre-school swimming lessons, in order to help introduce her pupils to the world of swimming.

Named as one of this year's Dream Toys by the Toy Retailers' Association, Robo Fish mimic the motion and characteristics of real fish when dropped into water

She said: 'The Robo Fish are fantastic, I can't stop telling people about them. Young children aren't used to putting their heads under water, so with the help of Robo Fish they really work in helping children conquer this challenge with no tears! They love the blue one!'
