This is the moment police searched a hire car linked to former Eastenders star Danniella Westbrook and allegedly found 'suspicious items' including a knife.

Officers seized a number of items from a Peugeot 208 which Miss Westbrook, 40, had reportedly hired from a garage in Chatham, Kent.

The former drug addict, best known for playing Sam Mitchell in the BBC show, was said to have paid to use the vehicle to help with a recent house move, reported the Daily Star.

The items were then discovered after staff at the garage did a routine check on vehicles, it is alleged.

The news of a police investigation comes as reports emerge that the actress is expecting a baby with her toyboy fiancé Tom Richards.

Miss Westbrook’s agent told MailOnline the actress had a Stanley
knife which was being used 
to cut open boxes during the move.

He also said the police had not spoken to Ms Westbrook.

A spokesman for Kent Police told MailOnline: 'Kent police was called on Saturday 10 May to a report that suspicious items had been found in a car in Chatham.

'Officers seized the items. No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.'

Meanwhile, The Sun reports that the actress is pregnant with her third child.

Miss Westbrook was spotted shopping for baby clothes with her cage fighter fiancé, 
who is 16 years her junior, in Brentwood, Essex.

A source told the paper: 'They are both over the moon. It's not something they planned but their romance has been intense.'

The actress, who split from her second husband Kevin Jenkins last December, has been dating Mr RIchards for three months. He proposed last month during a romantic holiday in Palma, Spain.

Miss Westbrook already has a 17-year-old son Kai and daughter Jody, 12.

Her agent did not want to comment on the reports when approached by the MailOnline.

The police investigation follows a rollercoaster year for Miss Westbrook.

 dating for three months

In April, Miss Westbrook thought her black Peugeot had been stolen from outside her home.

She later admitted the missing car had been repossessed because she had unknowingly failed to keep up payments.

Callous burglars also trashed Miss Westbrook's home in Essex three times during March.
