Peter Zervas, pictured in 2009, had half of his nose bitten off in an attack at his Leichhardt home on Tuesday

A man who allegedly bit off the nose of a former Hells Angel bikie has been charged.

A 28-year-old was stopped near his Hurlstone Park home about 4pm on Thursday.

He was charged with affray and cause grievous bodily harm to person with intent.

The man was refused bail and will appear in Burwood Local Court on Friday.

It is alleged he assaulted Peter Zervas outside his Leichhardt unit building, in Sydney's inner west, after he answered an intercom call on Tuesday.

Burwood Police took the man to the station after a Leichhardt Local Area Command investigation into the incident.

Mr Zervas had half his nose bitten off. The 38-year-old had to pick his nose up off the ground, drive himself to hospital and have it surgically reattached after he was assaulted at his unit.

'When I say "set upon", [the offender] grabbed a hold of the victim with his teeth on the victim's nose, bit down hard and bit the nose off,' Leichhardt Inspector Clive Ainley told reporters after Tuesday's attack.

Blood splattered on the front steps of the Norton Street unit complex was cleaned off on Wednesday and detectives were at the scene talking to nearby business owners.

The attack on Mr Zervas that police have labelled 'bizarre and severe' came days after his brother's alleged killer, Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi, was granted bail. There is no suggestion the two incidents are connected.

Before his nose was bitten off in the horrific attack, a friend of the former Hells Angels bikie said Mr Zervas was on the 'straight and narrow'.

The friend of 'Pete' Zervas, who did not wish to be named, said the recently-married businessman had turned his life around.

'He has had his Hells Angels tattoos and things removed,' he told the ABC.

'He is married now, he has a good business and he has been on the straight and narrow now for about three years.'

Mr Zervas's brother Anthony Zervas was killed in a brawl between rival bikie gangs at Sydney Airport in 2009.

A week after the brawl Peter Zervas was shot more than six times while getting out of his car in front of his Lakemba home in southwest Sydney, but he survived the attack.

The man accused of his brother's bashing, Mick Hawi, is due to be released after he was granted conditional bail on Monday.

He applied for release under the controversial new bail act last month after his 2009 conviction for the murder of Anthony Zervas was quashed earlier this year. He is awaiting a retrial.

On Wednesday, Inspector Ainley told MailOnline it was not known whether the victim knew the attacker, but he said the 38-year-old let the man into his home.

'The victim opened the door and then he was attacked,' he said.

Police are looking for CCTV footage to help identify the man who attacked the 38-year-old. The offender was last seen fleeing along the Parramatta Road end of Norton Street (pictured)
