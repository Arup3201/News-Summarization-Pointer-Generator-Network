An extremely enthusiastic seven-year-old made an unforgettable TV debut last week when he was given the chance to deliver his local weather forecast – and hilariously stole the show from the station’s veteran weatherman.

Appearing alongside Chicago’s WGN-TV’s resident meteorologist Paul Konrad, charismatic second-grader Charlie Hale offered a unique take on the day’s weather report, bringing a bit of sunshine to an otherwise dreary forecast with his impressive repertoire of jazz hands and dance moves.

Charlie, who clearly has a bright future in front of the camera, began the segment by revealing that it was his first time on television. But the budding weatherman showed no sign of nerves as he continued on with the Friday Forecast, the station’s special weekly segment which sees a different local child deliver the weather each week.

In addition to the day’s report, viewers were also given a detailed insight into Charlie’s future career aspirations.

'I want to be a police officer ...  because I love danger!' he said. 'But I also want to be a millionaire.'

'And I kind of want to be a soccer player, like I am right now,' he added, spinning around to show off the Argentina jersey he was wearing.

Charlie then demonstrated dance moves he learned from Calvin and Hobbes, as well as some he made up himself.

Unsurprisingly, the youngster claimed to be very popular at his school, Chicago's Mount Carmel Academy.

Finally, Mr Konrad let him deliver the weather by himself and his big personality completely overshadowed the forecast.

Gesturing wildly, he cheered as he told viewers that sunshine was on its way and boo-ed as he announced the arrival of lower temperatures.

Charlie’s forecast was clearly a hit with Mr Konrad’s colleagues – as well as station viewers – with news anchor Robin Baumgarten sarcastically joking: 'I wish he'd come out of his shell.'
