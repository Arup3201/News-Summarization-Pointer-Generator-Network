Britain's busiest speed camera detected more than 9,326 offences last year - more than one an hour throughout 12 months - generating £189,140 in fines, reveals new research.

The study found that the fixed camera on the M60, Junction 25, in Greater Manchester clocked 9,326 speeding offences in 2013 - generating an estimated £189,140.

The research also discovered that eight out of nine councils changed speed limits in their area last year, while 15 per cent of drivers who received speeding tickets in the same period were caught out by recent changes to speed limits.

Police and council data obtained by a freedom of information request by LV= car insurance, other busy speed cameras include one situated on the A13 Thames Gateway (westbound) to Scratton Terrace in London (8,002 offences issued), and one of the M54 between junction one and three in Staffordshire (7,403). 

Overall Police handed out almost 400,000 fixed penalty notices for speeding and 73,944 court summons last year, equating to motorists paying out £22 million in fines. This figure excludes those who took a speed awareness course to avoid paying a fine or receiving points.

Most drivers who were caught speeding said they were spotted by one of Britain’s estimated 3,353 fixed speed cameras (58 per cent), with a significant proportion caught by police with a camera at the roadside (28 per cent) or police without a camera (12 per cent).

On an average day, it is estimated that there is now a fixed or mobile camera in operation for every 67 miles of British road.

Since 2009, one in seven motorists (14 per cent) have been caught speeding and 22 per cent of these have been caught more than once.

Police figures show that the number of motorists caught speeding slightly increased last year with the total number of offences up by three per cent compared with 2012.

It would seem that one in six drivers (15 per cent) were caught out by recent changes to local speed limits, with a further one in five (19 per cent) saying that the speed limit was not clearly displayed so they were unsure what it was at the time they were caught.

On average 15 changes per council area were made to speed limits last year, with the majority of these introducing new slower zones in their area.

Among those drivers caught speeding more than once, nearly half (43 per cent) were caught speeding in the same location on more than one occasion. Many of these drivers believe that the location of this speed camera is unfair as the speed limit has recently changed at that location (21 per cent) or that the speed limit changes too abruptly (18 per cent).

John O’Roarke, managing director of LV= car insurance, said: 'It can be easy for motorists to become complacent when they get behind the wheel, especially when they drive on the same roads day in and day out.

'However, it's important that drivers always concentrate on the road so they can spot any new road signs, changes in speed limits, and are aware of what other motorists are doing.'
