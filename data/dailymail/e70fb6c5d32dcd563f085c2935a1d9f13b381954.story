A New York Fire Department worker was
convicted Wednesday of sexually assaulting five women, one as young as 
11 years old, in Brooklyn between 2001 and 2010.

Angus Pascall, 36, faces life in prison for the charges. His DNA tied him to the scene of every assault.

One of his alleged victims wept in 
court as she told how she was trapped in an elevator at her apartment 
building and repeatedly raped when she was 11.

The girl, now 14, was attacked on 
July 11, 2010 as she returned home from walking her dog by alleged 
serial rapist Angus Pascall.

The child was threatened with a gun 
by her attacker in the elevator in Crown Heights, New York before being 
sodomized multiple times and forced to perform oral sex.

After the horrifying ordeal, the girl ran home where she told her mother: 'Mommy, I just got raped.'

Pascall, 35, an FDNY emergency medical technician, has been charged with five sexual assaults after he allegedly used his fire department key to stop the elevator.

In July 2010, the girl told the court that a man followed her into the elevator and told her that it was broken before pointing a gun in her face.

'Then he said, ''Drop your pants and 
turn around.’ I did what he said and I was scared. I started to cry,''' 
she said, according to the New York Post.

Pascall has been  charged with five sexual assaults carried out in Brooklyn between 2001 and 2010, all of which he has pleaded not guilty to.

Prosecutors say they have DNA evidence which connects him to every single crime.

As the trial opened on January 9, a victim who was 22 at the time of her alleged attack in 2001 gave the first harrowing testimony.

The woman trembled as she told Brooklyn Supreme Court how Pascall allegedly came to her apartment door in Flatbush and asked if he could leave a package for a neighbor. He then pulled a gun and raped her, she told the court. 

A 14-year-old girl was also forced into 
the back courtyard of her apartment block by an attacker armed with a gun and a knife 
in 2009 and assaulted.

A 20-year-old woman was also 
allegedly kidnapped by Pascall around the same time. He pulled her into 
his car before raping her, according to the NYPD.

The victim managed to memorize Pascall's car license plate and he was arrested two days later in 2010. His DNA was taken from a cup he had been drinking from at the police station.

Pascal, who had been an EMT in Canarsie for five 
years at the time of his arrest, had been honored in 2007 after saving a
wounded patient’s life.
