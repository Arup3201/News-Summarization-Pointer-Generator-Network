Anger: Sarah Pike, 36, administered insulin to reduce her blood sugar level before tucking into her Big Mac - but was thrown out

A diabetic mum-of-two was ordered to leave a McDonald’s restaurant for injecting herself with insulin - after staff accused her of being on drugs.

Sarah Pike, 36, ordered a Big Mac from the fast-food chain last Friday and administered insulin to reduce her blood sugar level before tucking into her meal.

But when staff spotted her injecting herself they told her to leave the premises because they believed she was using hard drugs.

Mrs Pike, of Banbury, Oxfordshire, said: 'This was probably the most humiliating experience of my life and something like this has never happened to me before.

'I was shocked. I am Type 1 so I need to use insulin before eating meals each day, and I kept saying the pen could not be tampered with but they wouldn’t believe me.

'There were children in the restaurant at the time and they do not understand diabetes and what it means to me.'

Mrs Pike has now received an apology from McDonalds after she was booted out of the Bridge Street restaurant in Banbury.

As a Type 1 diabetic, she has to inject herself with insulin four times a day and monitor what food she eats.

She added: 'I have been diabetic for 13 years and I think there is a general misunderstanding of what the condition means.

'Some
 friends were saying that I should have gone to the toilets or somewhere
 private to do my injections but that isn’t the point.

'I don’t see why I should have to do that when this is something that is a day-to-day experience for me.

'I think more should be done to help educate everyone about the condition. My mum is really disgusted about it all.'

McDonalds yesterday apologised to Mrs Pike for the blunder.

A
 spokesperson said: 'We strive to create a friendly atmosphere in our 
restaurants and sincerely apologise to Ms Pike for any 
misunderstanding.'

There are 2.9 million people living in the country with diabetes and there are 850,000 people thought to be undiagnosed.

Type 1 diabetes accounts for ten 
to 15 per cent of all people with the condition and if they do not 
inject enough insulin through the day it can lead to a state called 
hyperglycemia.
