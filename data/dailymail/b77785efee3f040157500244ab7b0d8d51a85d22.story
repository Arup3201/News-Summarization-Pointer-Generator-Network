The owners of a 'monster' 130-pound pit bull Niko that mauled to death a young girl only one week before her fifth birthday are refusing to talk to investigators, police said.

Mia DeRouen and mother Megan Touchet, 27, were attacked by her boyfriend’s pit bull last week in their Houma, Louisiana, home while watching television. It took police 10 shots to finally bring the beast down, officials said.

Despite the young girl suffering severe wounds to her head, face and chest in the attack, and her mother handed her to paramedics through the window of a room she had barricaded herself in, Touchet and her boyfriend are refusing to talk.

April 3 would have been her fifth birthday.

'Monster': Niko was a 130 pound beast of a dog - the average pit bull weighs in around 50 pounds

'Happy birthday': Mia's father posted birthday wishes to his daughter online and pleaded with people to stop talking about pit bulls

‘Our detectives are in the process of trying to interview Megan and Kerry, who were the owners of this dog, but so far they've been unsuccessful in their attempts to talk to them,’ a Houma Police spokesperson told WWL.

Touchet and boyfriend Kerry Dominique are keeping tight-lipped on the advice of their attorneys, the spokesperson added.

They have remained silent in the week since Niko attacked the girl around 7pm last Tuesday.Niko is said by police to have been aggressively pacing around the apartment when they entered, and even attacked one of the officers.

Counselors have been called in to help even cops hardened through decades of service to get over the traumatic crime scene.

'We have some counseling that we are looking to set up for some of these officers,' a police official told WVUE. 'The scene, from what I understand, was pretty horrific.'

Investigators are looking into the series of events that led to the giant animal to commit the grisly act.

They are trying to determine if criminal negligence in how the killer canine was treated or stored could have led to the girl's death.

Niko tested negative for rabies, but authorities are still awaiting the results of testing for steroids, according to Houma Today.

Normal pit bulls tip the scales at about 50 pounds, and in rare cases hit 80 pounds, according to the ASPCA. Niko weighed 130.

There were early reports that investigators were looking into whether the dog was bred for fighting, but police have since dismissed those claims.

Vicious attack: Mia, pictured with her dad Chris, was pounced on by the dog, one of two at her mom's home in the Houma Highland Apartments

According to police, the attack happened inside the family home.

'She was screaming for help,' Duplantis said of the desperate mother's 911 call.

Mia
 suffered facial and head injuries in the pit bull attack and was rushed
 to Terrebonne General Medical Center but didn't make it.

Touchet suffered moderate injuries and was hospitalized as well. She remains in hospital today.

Duplantis did not know whether the girl was on a sofa or chair or on the floor when she was attacked.

Police reported that it was 'running loose inside the apartment acting in a very vicious manner' and officers shot it three times to 'eliminate the threat of additional injuries.'

'It's a traumatic event,' said Terrebonne Parish President Michel Claudet told WWL.

Her father, Chris DeRouen, has posted several times of his grief over losing his daughter.

'I'm just empty. I feel guilty the few times I've been able to smile or laugh....like I'm betraying her memory,' he wrote Wednesday.

'I know in my heart there's more I could have done. I can't shake it. I just want to go to sleep and shut my eyes forever.

'I dream a dream you never died, and there was never a day we didn't pick flowers... You bring me cups of tea and cook my favorite meals....bring them to me on your little colored plates. You ask me when I'm done, and serve me some more. And then I wake up.'

Every one of his posts is filled with dozens of offers of help, condolences and prayers - but he replies to none.

The devastated dad instead wished his dead daughter a happy birthday in one post and pleaded with everyone stop talking about pit bulls in the next.

Frantic call: Police officers were called to the complex around 7 p.m. by the girl's mother, Megan Touchet, who was also injured as the fought the crazed dog off her child

Prayers: Her father, Chris Derouen, picured, took to Facebook to beg for a miracle as his daughter fought for life in hospital. She later died

He previously took to Facebook to beg for a miracle as his daughter fought for life in hospital.

'Please I need prayers,' he wrote. 'My daughter was attacked by a pitbull and they don't know if she will make it....please God...I need this miracle.'

After she passed away he covered his wall with pictures of the two of them, and friends and family expressed their sympathies.

Claudet said the family had another pit bull.

'They had two pit bulls, and one was over 100 pounds,' he said, adding that this larger dog was the one that attacked Mia.

'Unfortunately, that's what happened and it's such a horrific event,' he said.

The second pit bull was taken away by animal control officers, police said.

Duplantis described the scene as 'horrific' and said counseling was being offered to the officers who were on the scene.

It's not clear if charges will be filed in the case, which is still being investigated.

A gofundme page to raise money for the child's funeral expenses has surpassed the original $25,000 goal set.
