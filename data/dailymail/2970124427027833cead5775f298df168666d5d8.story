In total animal welfare officers found 72 cats all of whom were severely malnourished and said that the conditions in the house were disgusting with animal waste in every room.

A police spokesman said: 'She was banned from keeping dogs, she had become obsessed with creating a new breed of dog and when that became no longer possible she switched to experimenting with cats.'

'There has obviously been some sort of sick experiments going on but until we get the autopsy is back on the bodies and have looked at the injuries to the life cats we won't know more about exactly what she was doing here.

The woman faces up to two years in jail this time for animal cruelty if police confirm that the animals were abused for illegal experimentation purposes.
