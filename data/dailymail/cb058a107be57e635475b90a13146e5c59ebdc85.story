These are the dizzying views captured by a pair of 'outlaw Instagrammers' from atop a New York City tower that will be the tallest residential building in the western hemisphere once it is complete.

One half of the duo has been charged with reckless endangerment and criminal trespass for scaling the tower at 432 Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan.

The daredevils made it past security and climbed to the top of the 1,380ft tower to photograph New York's breath-taking skyline at night.

After conquering the tower, the pair boasted about their latest exploit by posting photos on Instagram and videos on YouTube, where they have gained a legion of fans. 

A two-minute video takes viewers along for the nerve-wracking climb as the teenagers reach the top and cling perilously close to the edge.

At one point, it appears the pair have ascended into the heavens as they are enveloped in fluffy white clouds. 

One of the teens, known as Night Shift on Instagram, told MailOnline Travel that the whole climb took about four hours to complete. 

The teen, who declined to identify himself, said: ‘I never felt unsafe. I felt like I’ve done enough climbing to be OK.

'I did the climb because I just wanted to do it and we chose this building because it was the highest building we could get into.

‘The view was unreal. The photos can't explain how crazy it was being up there. Once-in-a-lifetime experience.’

Once it is complete the residential building will be home to luxury flats worth up to £52m apiece.
