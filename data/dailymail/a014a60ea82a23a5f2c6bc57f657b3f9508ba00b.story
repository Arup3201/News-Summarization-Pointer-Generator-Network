More than 500 male pupils and staff at a French high school are to undergo DNA tests after a 16-year-old-girl was raped - and police exhausted all other leads.

The testing of 527 men at the private Fenelon-Notre Dame high school in La Rochelle, south west France, was ordered after the girl was attacked in the bathroom of the school last September.

In a legal first in France, summonses went out last week to 475 teenage students, 31 teachers and 21 others - thought to be either staff or males who were on campus at the time.

Testing began today and is expected to last until Wednesday.

Prosecutor Isabelle Pagenelle said so far no one had refused the tests - but warned anyone who decided not to give a DNA sample would be considered a suspect and could be taken into custody.

The prosecutor said: 'The choice is simple for me. Either I file it away and wait for a match in what could be several years, or I go looking for the match myself.'

Pagenelle's office, which required 
parental permission for minors, says it will discard any DNA results 
from people who were eliminated as suspects.

The assault took place on September 30 in the pitch black and the girl unable to identify the criminal.

The prosecutor added: ‘She was attacked from behind and in darkness, but a trace of DNA was found in the clothes of the young girl.’

Police recovered genetic material from the girl's clothing - but had no matches to it in the country's DNA database.

The prestigious school has around 1,200 pupils - around half of which are boys.

Chantal Devaux, the private Roman Catholic school's director, told French media: 'This happened during the school day in a confined space.

'The decision to take such a large sample was made because it was the only way to advance the investigation.'

Devaux acknowledged all the results could still come back negative, sending investigators back to the drawing board.

In response, Pagenelle said: 'We think there is a strong probability that it's someone from inside, or at least someone who knows the building very well.'

A male pupil today said the DNA tests were creating a ‘very uncomfortable atmosphere’.

‘It’s
 the sense of suspicious which is the worst,’ he said. ‘Everybody has 
their theories, but nobody really knows who the culprit is.’

Some 16 forensics specialists and other police officers were carrying out the tests, at a cost equivalent of some £4000.

France has an extensive DNA database, 
with a total of 2 million profiles on file as of 2012 - about 3 percent 
of the population.
