Rotherham's dream of back-to-back promotions is still alive after they booked their place in the League One play-off final at Wembley by beating Preston 3-1 in a blockbusting semi-final second leg.

The Millers, who won automatic promotion from League Two last year, have had a magnificent season but they saved one of their best performances for the most important night and prospered thanks to goals from Wes Thomas, Lee Frecklington and Kieran Agard.

Rotherham boss Steve Evans was forced to usher ecstatic fans off the pitch when they ran on before the final whistle, but he could not hold back the jubilant hordes when their place at Wembley was confirmed.

It was a trademark display of attacking 
endeavour, orchestrated by the influential Ben Pringle, which could have
 yielded a bigger winning margin but was enough to set up a date at the 
home of football with Leyton Orient.

Simon 
Grayson's men more than played their part in an enthralling clash as 
they took the lead early on through Paul Gallagher's free-kick and then 
twice hit the woodwork in their attempts to get back into it though Jake
 King and Joe Garner.

But North End, who were among the pre-season favourites to go up, will now spend a fourth season in League One.

The
 tie was finely poised after Saturday's 1-1 first leg draw at Deepdale, 
but after a cagey opening the visitors seized the advantage in the 16th 
minute.

Rotherham
 defender Kari Arnason needlessly fouled Garner and from the resulting 
free-kick 30 yards out Gallagher's dangerous delivery evaded everyone, 
creeping into the far corner.

However,
 the Millers' response was swift and after Arnason should have atoned 
for his error almost immediately with a header that was superbly saved 
by Declan Rudd, they levelled in the 24th minute.

From
 a free-kick in a similar position to Preston's Pringle whipped in an 
equally delicious centre, which Thomas got a flying header to and it 
sailed through the hands of Rudd.

That
 quick riposte gave the Millers the impetus and again thanks to 
Pringle's incisive left foot they took the lead 10 minutes before the 
break.

The
 midfielder, who attracted interest from Reading earlier in the season, 
was afforded time and space on the left and sent in a pinpoint delivery 
which a late-arriving Frecklington superbly headed in off the post.

In front: Preston took the lead early on thanks to Paul Gallagher's goal but were then outclassed

Fightback: Wes Thomas got the hosts back on level terms less than 10 minutes after Preston's opener

Heads in front: Lee Frecklington then scored to put Rotherham 2-1 up before half-time

Game over: Agard made sure of the victory by adding a third goal for Rotherham in the 67th minute

The
 game was now completely open and Preston had several chances to claw 
themselves level before the break, but Garner and Gallagher both shot 
over.

And
 the Millers' biggest escape came on the stroke of the interval, 
goalkeeper Adam Collin left to thank a higher power as he inexplicably 
allowed John Welsh's shot to slip through his grasp but he breathed a 
huge sigh of relief as it dropped just wide.

The
 see-saw nature of the clash continued into the second half and Pringle 
almost put his side further ahead, but his sweet volley crashed into the
 bar while North End's top scorer Garner went close to emulating his 
superb first-leg volley with an effort at the back post from Gallagher's
 cross which flew over.

After
 Gallagher wasted a free header from 12 yards the Millers put one foot 
on Wembley Way in the 67th minute thanks to Agard's 26th goal of the 
season.

But
 his strike owed much to the creativity of James Tavernier who foraged 
down the right, twisted David Buchanan inside and out and rolled the 
ball across for Agard to turn into the bottom corner.

Preston
 did not lie down as they desperately tried to mount a recovery, King's 
35-yard effort clipping a defender on the way through and crashing into 
the upright before Garner endured a similar fate, as the Millers did 
enough to win.
