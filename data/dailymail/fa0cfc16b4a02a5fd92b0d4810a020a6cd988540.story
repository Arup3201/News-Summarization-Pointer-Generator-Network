Victim: WPC Yvonne Fletcher was gunned down while on duty outside the Libyan Embassy in London in 1984

A new suspect has been named in the killing of WPC Yvonne Fletcher who was gunned down outside the Libyan Embassy in London 28 years ago.

Pro-Gaddafi student Salah Eddin Khalifa was the man behind the fatal shot, according to a senior aide to Libya's prime minister.

He is living in a North African city where he fled as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime crumbled and could now be questioned about the shooting.

WPC Fletcher, who was 25, was killed by a
single bullet that hit her in the abdomen which was fired from the embassy during a demonstration in St James's Square in April 1984.

Ten dissidents were injured
as automatic gunfire was sprayed from a first-floor window of the 
building.

An 11-day 
armed police siege followed which ended with 30 Libyan nationals being deported.

Ashur Shamis -  a London-based 
opposition leader at the time - was at the demonstration when WPC Fletcher was 
shot and claimed Mr Khalifa has been named as the suspect by several 
sources in the former regime.

He alleged Mr Khalifa left the embassy by a back door just minutes later and before the building was surrounded by police.

Mr Khalifa was a part of a student  'revolutionary committee' loyal to Gaddafi  and did not have diplomatic status. On his return to Libya he was promoted to a lucrative post as head of the country's High Institute for Electronics.

Mr Shamis told the Sunday Telegraph it was 'mind boggling' that Britain had done so little to pursue the case almost a year after the overthrow of 
Colonel Gaddafi.

He added: 'It is time to do something about this. It is mind-boggling that the British 
authorities have done nothing. If they had taken it seriously, they 
could have solved it by now.

'People involved with the regime have confirmed the name to me. People in [regime] security who are now part of the revolution have confirmed the name. I keep hearing this name again and again.'

The transitional government has access to a number of regime prisoners and defectors with knowledge of the incident.

British diplomats denied dragging its feet over the investigation. Last month Metropolitan Police officers visited Libya for preliminary discussions about pursuing the case.

A spokesman for the British embassy in Tripoli said: 'The embassy is in close contact with the Libyan authorities to follow up on this visit.'

And a Foreign Office source told the Telegraph: 'Nobody should decry the energy and assiduousness with which the British government and the Metropolitan Police are seeking a solution to the murder of one of their police officers.'

According to sources, the Libyan Government were reported to be ready to announce significant developments as early as this week.

Mr Shamis said his contacts within the Gaddafi regime had given him the name of the alleged killer before last year’s revolution and he had since been able to confirm it in government.

He said he had given Mr Khalifa’s name to British police but had 'heard nothing' from them.

Abdulmajid Biuk, a member of a commission responsible for removing Gaddafi officials from state institutions, separately named Mr Khalifa to the newspaper.

Mohammed al-Alaghi, who served as justice minister for the first four months after the overthrow of Gaddafi, said Mr Khalifa was in the 'operation room' of the regime.

In April, Ali Hamiada Ashour, the current
justice minister, criticised Britain’s 'delay' in sending officers, 
adding that they were 'ready to give any help necessary' and 'this could
start now as far as we are concerned.'

At the family’s home town of Sabratha, west of Tripoli, Mr Khalifa’s brother, Abdulrazzak, confirmed that he was alive and out of the country, but refused to answer further questions.

A previous suspect named was Abdulmagid Salah Ameri, a junior Libyan diplomat, now thought to be dead.

A Scotland Yard spokesman refused to comment on whether Mr Khalifa’s name had been passed to them.
