For most people, completing three back-to-back marathons from London to Dover, rowing the English Channel, cycling 900-plus km to Verbier in Switzerland, hiking seven days across the Alps  to Zermatt and finishing by climbing the Matterhorn is a terrifying prospect.

Not for 64-year-old Richard Branson and his son Sam, who are currently embarking on the gruelling challenge to raise funds for charity.

The father and son are currently participating in the Virgin Strive challenge - an ultra-endurance fundraising event that started on August 7 and will end on September 6.

Challenge: Sam and Richard Branson are currently undertaking the Virgin Strive Challenge, which is made up of a series of gruelling challenges including climbing the Matterhorn. Here, they are joined by Isabella Calthorpe, Richard's wife Joan, Holly Branson and her husband Freddie

The event sees a core team, including Sam and joined by hundreds of others, such as Sir Richard, travel from the London O2 Arena to the summit of the Matterhorn in Switzerland, entirely under human power.

FEMAIL caught up with the Virgin boss and his son as they prepared to  take on one of the world’s greatest multi-day treks - the summer Haute Route Trek. Usually a nine-day tour, the team will complete the hike in just seven days.

'We're having a rest day,' Sir Richard tells us on the phone from Verbier. 'Obviously, Sam was out partying last night,' he joked.

Fitness fan: Richard isn't phased by the challenge and hasn't been training that much but luckily he plays tennis and goes kite surfing every morning so his fitness levels are already pretty good

He may be 64, but the athletic entrepreneur isn't feeling phased ahead of the 10-16 hour climb of one of Europe’s most iconic peaks, which at 4,478 metres, is one of the highest in the Alps.

'I haven't really been training, I'm pretty fit already. I'm most looking forward to the incredible scenery, spending time with the family and sleeping in a hut on the mountain,' he added. 

Sam, 28, who is undertaking the entire event, has found it a little more challenging. He said: 'I have an incredible amount of respect for everyone involved, it has been absolutely gruelling but there's been a lot of camaraderie and we've had a good laugh.

'On our 449km ride over four days, averaging 105m a day,  from Boulogne-sur-Mer to Troyes, in Central France, I played a little trick on the team.

'About 30m from the end, we were peddling up an enormous hill and I snuck in and merrily raced past them all, much to their horror. Little did they know, I had a hidden battery on my bike and had set it to supercharge.' 

Charitable: The Virgin Strive Challenge will be raising money for Big Change, a charity founded by six friends including Sam and Holly Branson, and Princess Beatrice

The Virgin Strive Challenge will be raising money for Big Change, a charity founded by six friends including Sam and Holly Branson, and Princess Beatrice.

Big Change is dedicated to improving the lives of young people in the UK and the money raised by the event will support a number of different projects working with young people to develop crucial life skills including communication, resilience and team work. 

The core team consists of Sam Branson, Richard Reed (Innocent Co-Founder), Marion Bartoli (former Wimbledon Champion), Karl Lokko (poet and social activist), Justin Packshaw (adventurer), Fiona Waller (trans-Atlantic and Indian ocean rower), Arnaud Haines and Noah Devereux (event co-founder and director). 

Other famous faces who took part in the marathon included Ben Ainslie, funnyman Jack Whitehall and singer Alexandra Burke.

'I called in my friends who have used life skills to succeed and the premise really captured their imagination, they felt emotionally invested in it,' explained Sam. 'They've all been striving for success in their lives so it was quite an easy concept for them to grasp.

'We believe the journey is as important as the destination, and that by setting yourself goals and striving to achieve them, you learn vital skills along the way. This is fundamental to the spirit of the Virgin Strive Challenge. It's such an amazing feeling when you've pushed yourself and achieved something.'

As someone who has achieved an enormous amount in his lifetime, Sir Richard shared his advice on what he believes it takes to succeed.

Explanation: Writing on Virgin.com, Holly explained that she wouldn't be taking part in the Virgin Strive Challenge because of her pregnancy with twins, which Sir Richard is ecstatic about

'I believe in getting fit,' he said simply. 'Now, more than ever, it is so important to be physically active and if you can be fit and healthy, you can achieve pretty much anything.

'I get up every morning and go kite surfing or play tennis and it sets me up for the day. People should strive to get involved in physical activities and if your body feels great, your mind follows.'

So how will they celebrate at the end? 'By putting my feet up in front of the fire and having a hot chocolate,' said Sam.

'By giving everyone the biggest hug ever,' added Richard. And, of course, they will be celebrating with 32-year-old doctor Holly - who recently announced her pregnancy on her father's company website.

'I am ridiculously excited about the arrival of my twin grandchild,' said Richard proudly. 'I'm encouraging Sam and Isabella to hurry up and have babies now too!'.

The team have raised £522,875 so far and are hoping to hit their target of £750,000 - click here to donate.
