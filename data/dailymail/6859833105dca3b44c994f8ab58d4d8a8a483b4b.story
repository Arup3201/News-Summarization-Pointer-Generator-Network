The WTA says Sabine Lisicki has hit the fastest record serve in the history of the women's tennis tour, reaching 131 mph (211 kph).

Lisicki hit the serve at 5-5, 40-30 of a first-round loss against Ana Ivanovic in the Bank of the West Classic on Tuesday. Ivanovic got her racket on the ball, but the attempted return landed wide.

The previous fastest WTA serve was 129 mph (208 kph), by Venus Williams at the 2007 U.S. Open.

Lisicki, a 24-year-old German, was the runner-up at Wimbledon in 2013.

The crowd were deligted at seeing history made.

'Well at least I broke the world record for fastest serve,' Lisicki tweeted after the defeat.

On the men’s side, Australia’s Sam Groth possesses the fastest serve of all time – 163mph – set at a Challenger event in South Korea in 2012.

Lisicki, the 2013 Wimbledon finalist, is well known for her big serve.

It’s earned her the affectionate nickname “Boom Boom” from tennis nickname guru Brad Gilbert.

Lisicki finished second in WTA aces last year, but hasn’t cracked the top 10 this year, thanks to a dearth of matches due to both poor play and injuries.

She hit an unreturnable 131mph serve at 5-5 in the first set against Ana Ivanovic, much to the delight of the small crowd that gathered on the Stadium Court. Ivanovic went on to win 7-6, 6-1
