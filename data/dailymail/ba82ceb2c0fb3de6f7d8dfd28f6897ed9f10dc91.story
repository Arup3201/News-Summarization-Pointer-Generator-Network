A North Melbourne Australian rules football player has been charged with three counts of rape relating to an incident in 2007.

Majak Daw, 23, who plays for the North Melbourne Kangaroos, has been issued with a charges summons in relation to a sexual assault in Altona North in 2007.

Police confirmed that detectives from the Sex Crime Squad detectives charged a 23-year-old from Wyndham Vale with three counts of rape yesterday.

'The charges relate to a historical sexual assault in Altona North in 2007,' a Victoria Police spokesperson told MailOnline.

'As the matter is before the court, it would be inappropriate to comment further.'

The North Melbourne Football Club released a statement confirming Majak Daw had been charged by Victoria Police in relation to the alleged crime.

'The club respects the integrity of the legal process and asks the right to privacy of all involved be respected,' the statement said.

'North Melbourne will support Majak and he will remain available for selection at VFL and AFL level.'

Police confirmed that the offences related to an incident in Altona North in 2007, when Daw was 16

AFL general counsel Andrew Dillon said the league would not bar Daw from playing, but would restrict his public appearances.

'Given the specific circumstances of the case, the AFL has determined that the player remains available for selection by his club,' Mr Dillon said.

'However, we will monitor the case and reserve the right to take action under our rules if deemed appropriate.

'Further, the AFL has determined that a restriction will be placed on the player's AFL and club promotional and development duties.'

Daw's management group Elite Sports Properties said he would not be commenting on the charges.

'He is entitled to a presumption of innocence and we would ask that this and the right to privacy of all involved be respected,' the group said in a statement.

A filing hearing is scheduled for July 11.

Daw made international headlines when he was drafted to the North Melbourne Football Club in 2009.

He was born in Khartoum in Sudan and fled to Australia as a refugee. He is the first Sudanese-Australian footballer to be drafted to an AFL club.
