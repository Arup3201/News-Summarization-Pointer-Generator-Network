Imagine it’s August 7 and your season is already over.

That is how Celtic fans felt on Thursday morning after their team’s humiliating exit from the Champions League at the first hurdle, against the far-from-mighty Legia Warsaw of Poland.

All that lies ahead now is nine months of a Scottish Premier League title procession with Rangers, Hearts and Hibs not even in the top division.

A Europa League campaign is still an outside possibility but judging by their 6-1 aggregate defeat against Legia, winning their play-off round later this month looks unlikely, particularly as they are certain to now lose some of their better players.

On the move? England international Fraser Forster is a target for Southampton

England World Cup goalkeeper Fraser Forster is wanted by Southampton and Celtic are in no position to turn down an £6million transfer fee given that they won’t be making any of the £30million on offer in the Champions League.

Highly-rated Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk could follow him to the south coast to link up with compatriot Ronald Koeman, now in charge at St Mary’s.

Nigerian defender Efe Ambrose has been linked with Premier League new boys Burnley. Kris Commons, 30, is in the final year of his contract.

Lonely figure: Celtic new boss Ronny Delia is under pressure following Celtic's Champions League exit

Left behind will be the club’s new Norwegian manager Ronny Deila – but for how long?

It’s true that Gordon Strachan and Neil Lennon also suffered Champions League disaster in their first seasons but they both had credit in the bank; Strachan as an experienced manager and Lennon a Celtic legend as a player.

Deila has neither in his favour and looks out of his depth having spent the rest of his career in Scandinavia.

It’s a sad sign of the times that the club who once employed Jock Stein and Martin O’Neill wouldn’t even be looked at twice by someone like former player David Moyes who is out of work after getting sacked by Manchester United.

Despite a worldwide fan base and the potential to fill Celtic Park to its 60,000 capacity every week, there just isn’t enough money in the Scottish game presently to attract B-list players and managers, let alone the elite.

Tactical guru: Legia  boss Henning Berg plotted a successful masterplan to beat Celtic over the two legs

The manner of defeat to Legia was a shock. Celtic had appeared in the last two group stages of the Champions League but were second best all over the park against the Polish team.

Their manager Henning Berg was sacked by Blackburn Rovers after 57 days last year but had no difficulty plotting a tactical plan that was far too good for Celtic.

Deila is in a no-win situation now. Win the league by 15 points and people will say it was expected.

Lose his best players and see Aberdeen and Dundee United close the gap, and fans will blame the manager.

Celtic legends from better eras in the club’s history have differing views.

Striker Frank McAvennie believes Deila was the easy appointment for chief executive Peter Lawwell because he could be easily controlled. Deila is only 38 and was happy for the club to appoint his assistant, John Collins.

‘I hope he (Deila) is not the puppet some people say he is but I fear he might be. What gaffer comes in and is told who his right-hand man will be?’ said McAvennie, who keeps his finger on the pulse of fans’ feelings in Glasgow as a pundit on Radio Clyde.

John Hartson, who played in a European final for Celtic against Jose Mourinho’s Porto in 2003, thinks Deila has to be more aggressive in his dealings with the board to guarantee investment in the squad.

He tweeted: ‘RD must now show why Celtic appointed him.. How will he react the pressure will be building rapidly. He needs players. Knock the door down!!’

It used to be a favourite guessing game where Celtic and Rangers would finish in the Premier League. The truth is Celtic are now Championship-standard, Rangers below that after their spectacular fall from grace.

Celtic’s European exit didn’t even take place at their own stadium. They used Murrayfield due to Parkhead being used in the Commonwealth.

The club will soon be able to return to their home venue – but the deeper-lying questions will remain.
