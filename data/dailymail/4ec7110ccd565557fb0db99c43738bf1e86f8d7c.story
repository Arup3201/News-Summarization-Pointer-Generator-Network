Police at one of the country’s largest forces are not dealing with crimes in person because of budget cuts.

Officers in Lancashire have been told not to attend certain incidents, including minor thefts and burglaries at shops, unless there is a realistic chance of solving them.

Instead, victims are being told to report crime online or even over the phone.

 Other minor investigations such as mobile phone theft and lost property will be shelved.

Crime scene investigators will no longer be sent to routine vehicle or criminal damage incidents.

Lancashire Constabulary has already made around £43million of cuts, resulting in a loss of around 500 frontline officers, but the Government says it must find another £20million of savings.

The policy emerged locally when Paul Hansen, 35, from Preston, was told that police couldn’t attend to help him recover his stolen moped because of budget cuts.

The bike, which Mr Hansen was restoring, was stolen from outside his house and, after reporting it to the police he found it himself, smashed up by a canal.

The dad-of-one said: ‘As somebody that pays taxes we are supposed to have faith in the police. Somebody can steal a motor vehicle or cause criminal damage and the police are not interested.

‘I am still raging. There’s fingerprints on it. If they took the prints they would find the perpetrator. This is nothing short of embarrassing, not only does it show the police do not care, it also shows the blatant disregard for the victims of crime.’

The force has also stopped providing crime numbers for people who have had their mobile phones stolen - something required by most mobile phone companies and insurers in order to get a replacement.

Assistant Chief Constable Mark Bates defended the move.

‘Every report of crime to Lancashire Constabulary is scrutinised by a police officer and a decision is made on the most appropriate course of action,’ he said.

‘This action could range from the immediate attendance of an officer, through to a telephone-based investigation. We have not stopped dealing with non-domestic burglaries and minor thefts, however, the way we deal with them has changed.

‘As with all crimes, we assess each of these types of incidents that come into us and from that, we decide whether there is a realistic chance of being able to solve the crime with the evidence available.’
