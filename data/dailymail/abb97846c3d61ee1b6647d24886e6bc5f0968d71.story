A team of zookeepers spent Tuesday morning doing something most people wouldn't dare to – raiding the nests of full-grown female alligators, which were adamant to protect their young.

The annual raids at the Australian Reptile Park in Somersby on the New South Wales central coast, could see up to 500 eggs collected this season from the nests of 30 odd resident female American alligators, which can grow to be up to three metres long.

Obviously an incredibly dangerous procedure, the raids require three keepers to restrain a female by wrestling her and tying her up with ropes, while a fourth removes up to 60 eggs from each nest.

'It is very dangerous obviously, because they're a large crocodilian, and females defending their nest will literally defend their nests with their lives,' Reptile supervisor Billy Collett told the ABC.

'The last week or so we've been practicing. It sounds stupid, but we literally put a blow-up alligator or crocodile on the ground and we practiced our jumps, our roping.'

As if the job wasn't hard enough, keepers were surprised to find an unusual sight during this year's raids, with one nest housing the eggs of two female alligators – making for double the wrestling.

'There's also the added problem of Brutus… a young male rogue that we've had problems with in the past. He's been charging keepers and is quite hostile,' a spokesperson for the park said.

The eggs require incubation for up to 70 days  as temperatures often prevent them from hatching naturally in the Australian climate

Success: Incubation also protects the eggs from hungry lizards and other alligators who are cannibalistic by nature

'American alligators have one of the strongest jaw pressures of any animal and one bite can be limb or even life-threatening.'

Normally American alligators guard their young until they hatch, at which point they gently take them in their mouths to the water where they teach them survival skills as they grow, but in Australia they require a helping-hand due to the hot climate.

The eggs require incubation for up to 70 days from between 29 to 32 degrees, as hot Australian temperatures often prevent them from hatching naturally.

It also further protects the eggs by guarding them from hungry lizards and ensuring that, once born, the young don't escape the alligator enclosure.

However, the biggest threats to the baby alligators are actually their own kind due to the species being cannibalistic. 

The Australian Reptile Park is the only zoo in Australia that breeds American alligators. It supplies zoos both nationally and internationally.
