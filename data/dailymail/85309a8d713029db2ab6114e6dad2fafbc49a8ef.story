This is the shocking moment a pair of violent thugs raided two off-licences after battering shop workers over the head - with bottles of alcohol.

CCTV taken from separate raids in Walsall, West Midlands, show the men first walking into the store before picking up wine and vodka.

They then approach the counter appearing to be about to pay before launching their brutal attack by smashing the shopkeeper over the head with the glass bottles.

Two thugs were captured on camera using bottles of alcohol to batter shop workers over the head during two terrifying robberies

One of the robbers can be seen raising up his arm and brandishing a bottle of alcohol (circled in red) during one of the violent raids on two off-licences in Walsall, West Midlands

On both occasions one of the men raids the till while the other continues to rain down powerful blows leaving terrified staff cowering in fear.

West Midlands Police released footage of the vicious attacks which took place on May 26 and June 2 and left one cashier with head injuries.

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to get in touch after the CCTV was also aired on BBC's Crimewatch.

Detective Constable Gerry Maley, from Bloxwich police station, said: 'Despite numerous inquiries in the area and appeals to the public, we are yet to identify the pair in the images.

'Someone, somewhere will know who they are and we're hoping that by showing these pictures on Crimewatch, we'll be able to appeal to a wider audience and get that one call we need to identify the men.'

The first attack happened at the Convenience Store off licence, on Glyn Avenue in Moxely, Walsall at about 10.40am on May 26.

The one minute 46 second clip first shows a stocky bald black man in a grey hoodie walking up to the counter with a bottle of red wine

He then launches it straight at the till worker while another man - wearing a black hoodie - runs behind the desk and pushes the shop assistant to the ground.

The second robber is described as an Asian or light-skinned black man, and is around six feet tall with a slim build. 

The pair then fumble with the lock to the till before opening it and escaping with hundreds of pounds in cash.

But before they flee, the man in the black hoodie picks up two more bottles of vodka, and launches one at the store worker.

The second robbery took place at a News & Booze, on Wednesbury Road in Darlaston, Walsall, at 10.10am on June 2.

Two men can be seen entering the store, and the shorter of the two, wearing a dark hoodie and sunglasses, picks up a bottle of white wine and approaches the counter.

The bottle is again  thrown at the shop assistant, as the second raider wearing a blue cap, leaps onto the desk.

This time the till attendant tries to fight back after grabbing a wooden pole - but after making a run for the shop door, he is overpowered by the two thugs.

The man in the cap then goes behind the counter, rips out the till drawer, and the pair flee the scene.

Anyone with information is asked to contact West Midlands Police on 101 or via Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
