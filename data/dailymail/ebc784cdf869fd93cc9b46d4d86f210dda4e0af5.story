One artist created an intricate model of a fast food restaurant entirely out of wood

Roxy Paine created the piece 'Carcass', an installation comprised of two large scale dioramas at the Kavi Gupta gallery in Chicago. This is part of 'Apparatus', Paine's first solo show in Chicago.

Paine's replica leaves no detail behind and is equipped with a deep fryer and a soft serve ice-cream machine. What's missing however,  are big logos and any semblance of food. The other diorama is meant to resemble a control room with an unknown function, reports thisiscolassal.com. 

The models are made of birch, maple, glass, and are accented by fluorescent lighting. 

'Paine transforms the environments on display by using the diorama’s traditional experience as a tool to create a contemplative experience where what we see behind the glass transitions between being real and being a mere shell of something real,' says the gallery's website.

The gallery's website explains that in the Greek language diorama quite literally translates to, 'through that which is seen.'

'Roxy Paine introduces a new chapter in his work, a series of large scale dioramas. Inspired by spaces and environments designed to be activated via human interaction, a fast-food restaurant and a control room, the dioramas present spaces and objects which are hand carved from birch and maple wood and formed from steel, encased and frozen in time, void of human presence, making their inherent function obsolete,' explains the website.

The spaces the artist creates are reliant on the viewer's 'human interaction' to give them a function and are otherwise devoid of meaning.

Wood you eat in this kitchen? The large scale model is devoid of any food

Grease is the word: The kitchen is equipped with a wooden deep fryer

Everybody freeze: This kitchen is even stocked with a soft-serve machine, but it doesn't dispense anything

Put a lid on it: There are coffee covers but no coffee to be found

Do you want fries with that?: There are even replicas of paper packaging for french fries

Pretty kitschy: The kitchen has a deep fryer, cups, lids, and seemingly everything but food

Watching over you: the art relies on the viewer in order to give it a function

Drawing straws: the model is so realistic it even has a star dispenser and two scattered straws

Diorama quite literally means 'that which is seen' and the art in Paine's installation relies on the viewer in order for the structures to have meaning
