It was a run that ended on a high with the Club World Cup won in Marrakech against San Lorenzo but in the end Real Madrid stopped just short of setting a new world record for consecutive wins.

After 22 straight victories they fell just short of Coritiba – the Brazilian side who currently hold the Guinness world record for 24 wins – and the Ajax team that strung together 26 straight wins in the 1971-72 season (losing only one friendly match on the run).

They were given a guard of honour on to the pitch at the start of the Valencia game. The gesture was for their Club World Cup success but it could easily have been for the longest winning streak in Spanish football history.

When they beat Ludogorets 4-0 in their last Champions League group game they set a new Spanish record of 19 wins, beating the 18-game run of Frank Rijkaard’s Barcelona side in the 2005-06 season.

Ajax and Coritiba might have remained a step too far but Carlo Ancelotti and his coaching staff may breathe a sigh of relief that the loss has come now and not as they build up steam in their bid to win the treble this season.

Valencia in Mestalla was always going to be a tough first game back after the winter break and finally the tank ran dry. Even if they had beaten Nuno’s Valencia team it still would have been tough to keep winning with a two-legged tie against Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey still standing between them and the record.

Two wins over an Atletico side boosted by the return of Fernando Torres, and wins over Espanyol and Getafe would have seen them set a new record but it has still been an incredible journey and one that started after consecutive defeats to Real Sociedad and Atletico Madrid earlier in the season.

Back then there were doubts over whether the new signings were fitting in, and whether the side could cope with the loss of Angel Di Maria and Xabi Alonso.

'I think it was a combination of some change in personnel and a difficult pre-season coming off the back of a World Cup on an American tour where we only had 10 senior players,' reflected Carlo Ancelotti’s assistant coach Paul Clement.

The first win of the run came on September 16 at home in the Champions League when Basle were on the wrong end of a 5-1 hammering. Madrid then put eight past Deportivo and five more past Elche. Suddenly they were averaging six goals a game and it wasn’t all easy home wins against intimidated opposition either.

They went to Villarreal and won 2-0 and they then went to Bulgaria and saw off Ludogorets 2-1. Then came the reat test – Liverpool, Barcelona and Liverpool again in the space of just two weeks. They made it look easy.

'Going to Anfield is always difficult because of that atmosphere,' said Clement. 'It’s like another player for them. But we did really well after a difficult first 20 minutes. We got the goal and calmed the crowd.'

Real ran out 3-0 winners and former Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo was even applauded off by the Kop when substituted.

Barcelona turned up the Santiago Bernabeu in the next game and were still yet to concede a goal. They scored first with debutant Luis Suarez setting up Neymar. But Real were too strong and ran out 3-1 winners.

After wins over Cornella and Granada, Liverpool visited the Bernabeu with a drastically changed team from the first leg but Real still won 1-0.

With three mighty scalps under their belts the Madrid steamroller went on flattening the opposition until the end of 2014. They scored 81 goals on the 22-match run with Cristiano Ronaldo netting 28 of those – a stunning tally sufficient to win league top scorer in most seasons.

The other two-thirds of the BBC front three – Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema – also made it into double figures. And only four times on the run did they not have the majority of possession.

‘Will you be affected by the defeat?’ Ancelotti was asked after the 2-1 defeat to Valencia. ‘After winning 22 straight games, I don’t think so,’ he replied.

Madrid fans were also buoyed by Barca’s defeat to Real Sociedad coming on the same day. Front pages in the capital that reflected on the end of the run also ran with ‘Luis Enrique shoots himself in the foot’ headlines.

The winning streak has been worthy of Spanish and European champions – now Real Madrid have to go on and bag both those trophies to ensure that after such a wonder mid-season procession of victories they also get a victory parade at the end of the campaign.
