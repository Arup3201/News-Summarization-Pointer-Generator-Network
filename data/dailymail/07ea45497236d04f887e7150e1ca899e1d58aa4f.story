A man will be sentenced next month after former Manchester United footballer Andy Cole was racially abused on a plane.

Cole, 42, was returning to the UK on a flight from Dublin to Manchester on Sunday when the incident happened.

Police were called to Manchester Airport following reports that two passengers were drunk and would not co-operate with Aer Lingus cabin crew.

Lee Patrick Byrne, 28, from Dublin, and Gregory Horan, 26, of no fixed abode, were arrested on landing and appeared in court yesterday.

Byrne pleaded guilty at Trafford Magistratesâ€™ Court to a racially aggravated public order offence and being drunk on an aircraft, the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed.

Horan admitted being drunk on an aircraft.

The defendants were bailed to appear at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court for sentencing on January 20.

Both men could be imprisoned for the offences with a maximum five-year term for being drunk on an aircraft.

Ex-striker Cole, from Cheshire, is now a club ambassador at Manchester United and is also involved with other black footballers with the Kick It Out campaign, which aims to stamp out abuse from the stands and in the dressing room.

Yesterday he tweeted: 'Can I just say thank you for the tweets and the support.'

Cole has been subjected to racial taunts throughout his career both on and off the pitch.

Campaigner: The former Manchester United star is an avid supported of anti-racism campaigns such as Kick It Out which works against discrimination within the sport

The Nottingham-born striker has been heavily involved with anti-racism campaigns and charities throughout his career.

In 2000 he established the Andy Cole Children's Foundation which aided AIDS orphans in Zimbabwe.

Cole is the second-highest goal scorer in Premier League history behind Alan Shearer.
