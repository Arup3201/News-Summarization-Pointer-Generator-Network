The bravery medals won by a Spitfire ace who shot down three enemy aircraft on the same day have sold for £144,000.

Air Commodore Ronald ‘Ras’ Berry was one of the RAF’s greatest pilots, racking up more than 30 ‘claims’ on enemy aircraft, including 14 confirmed kills, during the Second World War.

On August 31, 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain, he downed a German Messerschmitt 109 plane either side of breakfast and then a third before dinner.

The officer, who sported a handlebar moustache, admitted that seeing German bombers destroy British cities motivated him to exact revenge.

Air Cdre Berry was held in such high regard that he was one of few airmen chosen to lead Winston Churchill’s coffin at his funeral 20 years after the end of the war

He was awarded the CBE for his services along with the Distinguished Service Order and Distinguished Flying Cross with Bar - the Bar means he had received two of the same medal.

The medals, along with his log books and several aviation maps, have now been auctioned for the six figure sun at the Spink & Son auction house in London.

Oliver Pepys, a medals expert at Spink, said: 'Ronald Berry was one of The Few [a phrase coined by Winston Churchill to describe pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain] who distinguished themselves in World War II.

'He did have such an amazing tally of kills and probable kills.

'His medals are very significant, in the fact you have a DSO and a DFC with Bar - three superb gallantry awards for World War II.

'The DFC is for the Battle of Britain. He was very much one of The Few who stopped Operation Sea Lion - Hitler’s plan to invade Britain - from happening.

'Prices for gallantry medals are very strong at the moment.'

Air Cdre Berry, who died in 2000 aged 84, was born in Hull and joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve in 1937.

Two months after the outbreak of the war he was sent to Montrose in Scotland to help protect the airfield there and served in 603 Squadron.

Days later he was involved in one of the earliest interceptions of the war when he damaged a Heinkel III bomber.

He went on to shoot down a Junkers 88 bomber into the North Sea and had three shared kills during his time in Scotland.

Due to increasing RAF casualties, 603 Squadron was sent to south east England on August 1940 during the height of the Battle of Britain.

In September 1940 Air Cdre Berry was involved in up to four dog-fights a day and accounted for 14 different enemy aircraft in that time, earning him his first DFC.

After the Battle of Britain he was one of only eight survivors out of the 24 original pilots from 603 Squadron.

He was promoted from Sergeant Pilot to Squadron Leader and took part in a convoy patrols as well as providing air cover for the disastrous Dieppe Raid in 1942.

His 81 Squadron was the first to land in French North Africa in November 1942 where he had a farcical exchange with a French commander, with each claiming superiority over the other - eventually someone intervened and explained to the Frenchman that the Brits had the edge.

By the end of the Tunisian campaign in May 1943, he had downed 14 enemy aircraft destroyed, have shared kills on another ten, along with nine probables, 17 damaged and seven destroyed on the ground.

After the war he was in charge of the Air Fighting Development Unit at West Raynham in Norfolk, made OBE in 1946 and CBE in 1965.
