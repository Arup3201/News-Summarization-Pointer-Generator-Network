The United States Army has reportedly approved hormone therapy that will allow imprisoned national secrets leaker Chelsea Manning to transition to a woman.

Manning, 27, is serving a 35-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas after being convicted of giving thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks while working as an Army intelligence analyst.

She was known by the name Bradley at the time.

The Army's approval of Manning's transition was first reported by USA TODAY.

In an Army memo, the commandant of Fort Leavenworth's Disciplinary Barracks, Col. Erica Nelson, wrote: 'After carefully considering the recommendation that (hormone treatment) is medically appropriate and necessary, and weighing all associated safety and security risks presented, I approve adding (hormone treatment) to Inmate Manning's treatment plan.'

As
 I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know 
the real me. I am Chelsea Manning. 

I am a female. Given the way that I 
feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as 
soon as possible. 

I hope that you will support me in this transition. I 
also request that, starting today, you refer to me by my new name and 
use the feminine pronoun (except in official mail to the confinement 
facility). 

I look forward to receiving letters from supporters and 
having the opportunity to write back. 

The therapy was approved on February 5. 

Manning announced a day after her August 2013 conviction that she was a woman.

She is eligible for parole in about seven years. 

During her trial, a Navy psychiatrist testified that Manning suffers from gender identity disorder, or wanting to be the opposite sex, as well as narcissism and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

After her conviction, Manning sued the federal government for access to hormone therapy treatment.

She was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union. 

Lawyers argued that Manning was as at a high risk of suicide unless she received the treatment.

In addition to the therapy, Manning also wanted the right to dress and live as a female.

The military does not allow transgender individuals to serve although the Department of Veterans Affairs does provide hormone therapy treatment for veterans.

Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James previously told USA TODAY the transgender troops ban should be lifted. 

There were 3,177 veterans diagnosed with gender identity disorder from 2001 to 2011,, according to the department of Veterans Affairs. 

It's not clear when Manning's treatment will begin.
