Gareth Bale has slammed the artificial pitch at Andorra’s Estadi Nacional as ‘by far the worst pitch’ he has ever played on after his late free-kick gave Wales a narrow 2-1 win over the minnows in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier.

 It was the first time the 3G surface had been used for a match and the difficulties with controlling the ball were clear for all to see.

The roll would be uneven and bounces awkward, with clusters of black rubber pellets spraying into the air with each landing.

Dodgy surface: Gareth Bale said the 3G surface in Andorra was the worst he's ever played on, despite scoring twice in the win

At last: The Real Madrid star wheels away after scoring a crucial winning goal for Wales, getting their qualifying campaign off to a good start

Jumping for joy: Bale celebrates his winning goal 10 minutes from time in front of the travelling Welsh fans

Roar: Bale is joined by Joe Ledley to celebrate the late goal that spared their blushes against an Andorra team that has won just one international in their history

Manager Chris Coleman had tried to play down fears of the pitch’s unsuitability before kick-off but afterwards declared he felt it was not up to UEFA standards.

The surface was only certified by Europe's governing body last week after originally failing tests because of a fast roll.

‘It was by far the worst pitch I have ever played on,’ said Bale. ‘I can't describe how bad, bobbly and hard the pitch was to deal with.

‘We said at the start that the most important thing was to get three points. Other teams are going to find it difficult coming here so for us to get three points is important.

‘We want to qualify and you have to come to places like this and get victories.’

A 3G - or 'third generation - pitch is made of artificial plastic grass 'blades' and is suitable for all weather conditions, meaning it is largely unaffected by differing seasons and temperatures.

The artificial turf is held in place by a thin base layer of sand, as well as an infill of rubber pieces which act like the soil on a normal pitch in order to allow grip.

Plastic pitches were originally banned from English football in 1995 after Queens Park Rangers, Preston North End, Oldham Atletic and Luton Town had trialled them during the 1980s, with Loftus Road the first English stadium to try it in 1981 and Preston  the last Football League club to remove theirs in 1994.

However, the FA made a U-turn in March when they announced that synthetic pitches could be used in every single round of the FA Cup this season - having previously only allowed them up until the first round proper.

Maidstone United, who play in the Ryman Premier League, have had great success with their 3G pitch and have championed its cause. Artificial pitches are also used in many places on the continent, particularly in Eastern and Northern Europe.

Targeted: Bale also had to deal with some roughhouse tactics from Andorra's defenders, tackled here by Marc Vales from behind

Tricky task: Wales' players such as Neil Taylor, pictured,  had to get used to playing on an artificial pitch in Andorra

Challenging: Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey was also tested by the tricky surface against the minnows, who have lost their last 45 competitive matches

Coleman kept his team from practising on 3G pitches through fear of its effects on joints and went through a light training session on Monday evening for the first time.

‘I can talk about the pitch now, if you're a passing team forget it,’ he said. ‘I don't want to make a protest as I want other teams to come here.

‘But when we trained on it, my heart sunk. In my opinion the pitch is not up to standard of UEFA qualifier.’

Mission complete: Two-goal hero Bale salutes the Wales fans after the final whistle, but he'll know they have a long way to go to qualify

Kicking up: The artificial 3G turf sprays up from the pitch as Aaron Ramsey passes in midfield during the crucial victory

Surrounded: Wales enjoyed 71 per cent of the possession against Andorra, including this attack by Ramsey, but struggled to make a breakthrough

Eyes on the ball: Bale manages to get a pass away on the tricky surface despite the attentions of Andorra's Ildefons Lima

Calm down: Bale appeals for Wales fans to settle down after scoring their second goal, with supporters having run on the surface

On the pitch: Wales fans knocked down advertising hoardings and encroached on to the pitch after Bale's free-kick winner 

Celebrations: Welsh fans joined the players to celebrate the winning moment, with goalscorer Bale acting to calm things down

If Wales were expecting an easy ride in the principality they were stunned when Andorra took the lead after just six minutes. 

Swansea defender Neil Taylor conceded a soft penalty, referee adjudging him to have pulled the shirt of Ivan Lorenzo. Ildefons Lima made no mistake from the spot to score Andorra's first competitive goal in four years. 

But Bale rescued Wales with a classy double to get the qualifying campaign off to a winning start. 

First he headed home from Ben Davies' excellent cross. And the world's most expensive player curled in a beautiful free-kick with 10 minutes remaining to claim the victory. 

Spectacular: The sun sets over the Camp d'Esports del M.I. Consell General in Andorra le Vella, where the match took place

Committed: Wales midfielder Joe Ledley challenges for the ball with Andorra's Christian Martinez and Josep Ayala

Relieved: Bale is all smiles at the final whistle as him and his Welsh team-mates head to the travelling support

Nightmare: Ildefons Lima celebrates giving Andorra a dream start in the Euro 2016 qualifier, but it didn't last until half-time

Tense: Chris Coleman cut a nervy figure on the touchline as Wales toiled, but the boss was eventually saved by Bale
