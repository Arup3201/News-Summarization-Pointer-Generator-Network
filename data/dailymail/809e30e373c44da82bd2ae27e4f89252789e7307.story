A mother-of-four says she is desperate to get two stone of excess skin removed after she lost more than half of her body weight.

Kerry Trotter lost 16st after being given a gastric bypass in September 2011.

The 39-year-old dropped from 27st to 11st in three years after realising she was going to die if she kept putting on weight.

Kerry Trotter lost 16st after being given a gastric bypass in September 2011 but has been left with two stone of excess skin that she is desperate to get rid of

But following her drastic weight loss, Mrs Trotter says she cannot get funding to have the excess skin removed.

Mrs Trotter, who is mother to Hayley, 21, Brad, 19, Caitlin, 14, and Holly, 11, now fears she will be stuck with the skin forever.

The mother, from Penshaw, County Durham, believes the lack of funding is due to a postcode lottery.

She said: 'You should be examined as a person not by the area you live in.

'If the funding for it isn’t available here then they should go to someone else.

'Some places seem to get funding to remove access skin no bother whereas others have to fight for it.

'I really hope I get it as I cannot afford to pay for it myself. Even though I have lost the weight the excess skin still means I have to buy stretchy clothes and a size bigger to hide the lumps and bumps.'

Mrs Trotter put on weight after becoming pregnant with her first daughter, Hayley, and moving in with her husband Lee, 42.

She said: 'I put on weight really quickly as I was buying my own food and eating what I wanted.

'My mum was always losing weight and 
putting it back on again and I knew I didn’t want to be like that. I 
didn’t care about my weight as long as I was happy.'

Mrs Trotter would regularly eat takeaways for dinner or go for a bar meal as it was easier than cooking a meal at home.

She would snack on multipack bags of crisps as well as chocolate and fried food.

But it wasn’t until she struggled to fit into a size 32 pair of jeans, the biggest she could buy in the shops, that she decided she needed help with her weight.

She said: 'I didn’t realise how big I was. I bought a paid of size 32 jeans and I could barely fasten them up.

'By the time I got to the pub I had to undo the button.

'Luckily I was wearing a long t-shirt to cover up. I was wearing the same clothes all the time as I couldn’t find anything to fit.

'It got to the point when I realised if I don’t do something I am going to die. I couldn’t walk up the stairs without puffing and panting and could not even walk to the shop at the end of the street, I had to drive.

'I would purposefully wait until the 9am bus and take my children to school late as I could not walk up the bank to school.

'None of my children could put their arms around me I was so big.'

In 2009 Mrs Trotter visited her GP and was put on slimming pills and appetite suppressants to help her lose weight.

However when they failed to help, her GP suggested a gastric bypass.

However, Mrs Trotter had to lose weight naturally beforehand to prove she was dedicated.

She joined her local Slimming World class and lost four stone before undergoing the gastric bypass operation at 22st.

She has since gone on to lose another 11st since the operation, however, she maintains she couldn’t have done it if she had left Slimming World.

She said: 'I still go to my Slimming world class, I couldn’t have done it if I had left.

A gastric bypass is just an aid, you still feel like you can eat the same amount and have that extra spoonful. I have had to be determined and eat healthily too.

'Now I have lost the weight I feel great. I am still getting used to being able to go into a shop and picking up and item of clothes knowing it will fit. I have just bought a dress for the first time since I was 16 - my first ever little black dress. It feels amazing.

'Now I am just waiting for the final piece of the puzzle and hoping I can have the excess skin finally removed.'
