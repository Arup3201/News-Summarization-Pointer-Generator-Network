A bedroom was destroyed when light reflected from a mirror onto a set of curtains setting them on fire. 

Emergency services were called to the home in Saffron Walden, Essex, following reports of black smoke filling the property. 

There, they extinguished the bedroom fire which damaged the window, wall, ceiling and carpet. 

A fire was started in the bedroom by the vanity mirror, ruining the cream walls, ceiling and carpet with smoke  

While the incident was unusual, fire fighters said it was not unheard of for certain mirrors to set fire to fabric by reflecting light.  

Essex County Fire and Rescue Service station officer Paul Curtis said: 'It’s not the first time I have been called to a fire which started like this.

'It’s not something most people would think about but these magnifying mirrors can create a hot and focused beam of light and in this case it set fire to the curtains.

'Anyone who has one of these mirrors should seriously consider making sure it is kept away from windows and direct sunlight, especially on sunny days like today.

Earlier this year a woman's vanity mirror burned holes in her curtains when. Fire fighters noticed the singed rings during a home visit. 

A spokesman from East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said: 'The sun's rays can be magnified by a lens or magnifying mirror and become focused on a nearby object such as curtains, clothing or even wooden or plastic furniture, fixtures or fittings.

'This can cause scorching, or charring potentially leading to smouldering or flaming ignition of the object.

The ceiling in the bedroom and its carpets were destroyed by the smoke which filled the bedroom after the fire

'In the evening, morning and during the winter, when the sun is lower on the horizon, the shallower angle at which the sun's rays hit the earth means that it is particularly important to be aware of objects, such as magnifying vanity mirrors and glass ornaments, which may be left exposed to direct sunlight. 

'While this type of fire may seem like one of the more unusual cases, in principle it is the same as focussing the sun's rays with a magnifying glass and, as this case clearly demonstrates, sunlight being focussed by everyday objects can indeed set light to things in the home.'
