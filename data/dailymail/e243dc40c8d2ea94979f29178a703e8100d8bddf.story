Innocent: Rachel Ehmke, 13, killed herself after a group of girls scrawled 'slut' across her locker and sent her texts telling her to leave the school

Bullied: Rachel Ehmke, 13, is believed to have sent an anonymous text branding herself a 'slut' before her suicide as a way to get kicked out of school

A 13-year-old girl who hanged herself days after a text message branding her a 'slut' was sent to girls at her school may possibly have composed the message herself, it has emerged.

Rachel Ehmke's father believes she sent the message as a way to be kicked out of middle school, where she had suffered months of bullying at the hands of a clique of girls.

A group of 'mean girls' had scrawled 'slut' across her locker and put chewing gum in her books. They also cornered Rachel in the locker room, where she had taken to eating lunch to avoid them.

Officers in Kasson, Minnesota have been 
investigating the suicide of seventh grader.

The Dodge County Sheriff's Office has now announced it believes she hanged herself due to 'harassment and bullying' at school - but no charges will be charged against those responsible.

'There is not one incident or action done by any particular student(s) that we believe is responsible for Rachel's death,' the Dodge County Sheriff's Office reported in a news release.

'Because of this, the County Attorney's Office had determined that there is insufficient evidence to file charges against anyone regarding this case.

'However, the students responsible for harassing these students who were singled out will now risk being charged if their conduct continues.'

Tragic: Rachel was found hanging in her bedroom with a note saying 'I wish I could tell you how I really feel'

Tormented: Although police determined she died after bullying, they are not going to file any charges

The investigation also revealed that the threatening text message forwarded to girls at the school was sent from Rachel's father's home through an iPod messaging service that uses the internet.

The sheriff's office said it was difficult to say why Rachel might have sent the text, but conversations before her death indicated she was unhappy with how her concerns were being dealt with.

She had told her family she wanted to move schools after the bullying had not stopped months after it began, and officers found a note in her locker indicating she was thinking of leaving the school.

Her father Rick told KTTC-TV he thinks Rachel sent the message in order to get removed from the school to avoid further bullying.

He added that he was surprised when 
authorities decided not to charge any of the children who allegedly 
tormented her. He said the school did not take her complaints seriously.

'There were no kids taken out of sports 
because of it, no kids made to say they are sorry,' he said. 'There were
no kids that had to clean up the mess to her locker or return the stuff
they stole.'

Grief: Rachel's parents Rick and Mary. Rick said the school did not do enough to punish the girls responsible

But he said he does not want to see anyone punished - but to realise what bullying does to people.

'Those words,' he said, 'Not everybody can handle those words and it killed her. I will go to my grave knowing that's what did it.'

He added that he did not want the four students who reported the text to be blamed for her suicide, as is believed to have happened. The sheriff's office said Rachel said she got along with these girls.

Rachel was found hanging in her mother's home with a note nearby which read: 'I'm 
fine = I wish I could tell you how I really feel.' Also scrawled on the 
note was a drawing of a broken heart.

She had told her brother Jonathan she had 
homework to do, so he dropped her off at her mother's house while she was in Las Vegas.

Jonathan
then called his father to ask him to collect Rachel and Rick arrived at
the house around 25 minutes at her big brother had left.

Investigation: The parents do not blame the school but wish the bullies had faced greater consequences

Findings: The Dodge Sheriff's County Office said no one incident led to her death so could not file charges

When he walked up to the door, he saw Rachel hanging by a noose from a beam of the ceiling inside through the window.

He broke into the home by smashing 
the door with a baseball bat and got his daughter down, before calling 
911. She was still alive but had sustained damage to her brain, heart 
and lungs and later died.

Rick said he spoke with his 
daughter the evening before she killed herself and she begged him not to
get involved after the text messages calling her a slut had been sent out.

He added
that he was stunned to learn six weeks after Rachel's locker was 
defaced that it had not been cleaned. He said that changed only after he
sent an email to the middle school principal.

'She
tried to deal with it. We thought she was dealing with it and the 
school thought she was dealing with it,' Rick Ehmke told KARE TV. But he added: 'She locked 
into this stuff and couldn't let it go.'

He added to Fox News: 'I'll never understand, but I need to figure out how to go through life without my daughter.'
