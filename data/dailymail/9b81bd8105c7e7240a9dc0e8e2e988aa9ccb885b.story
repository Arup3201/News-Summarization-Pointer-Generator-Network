The mother of one of the girls abused by former Hey Dad! actor Robert Hughes has called for an inquiry into why he was not charged by police when she reported his actions almost thirty years ago.

The woman has spoken out just days before the 65-year-old actor is due to be sentenced for 10 child sex offences, committed between 1983 and 1991.

Her daughter was abused at least three times while visiting Hughes' house on Sydney's north shore.

Robert Hughes was found guilty of 10 child sex offences last month. The crimes occurred between 1983 and 1991

On one occasion Hughes forced the girl to lay her head in his lap while he had an erection, under the pretence of administering ear medication to her. On two occasions he made her swim between his legs while his penis was exposed.

The woman, who cannot be named, reported Hughes' abuse of her daughter in 1988, when the girl was nine, and her daughter reported the abuse again 10 years later, but both times police told her there was nothing they could do.

She told the Sydney Morning Herald of the moment her daughter first spoke of the abuse.

'She crawled up next to me one day and said: "Mummy, the next time Robert rings can you please say I can't go? â€¦ Robert makes me sit on his penis and I don't like it,"' she said.

The mother of one of Hughes' victims (Hughes is pictured here with his wife Robyn Gardiner) has spoken out about her anger that police did not charge Hughes when she initially reported the abuse in 1988

The mother reported the abuse to the girl's school a few days later and then made a statement to police.

Both the police and the girl's school told her that they were aware of Hughes' reputation but nothing could be done.

'The detective said, "I can't proceed." He was quite distressed. He said, "I've tried to get this guy but every time I do someone covers for him,'" she said.

Ten years later the daughter reported the abuse to police, this time in Queensland, but was again told that nothing could be done.

The mother said the police's inaction devastated her daughter and meant that Hughes remained free to abuse other girls.

'There were all these horrible things that were done to these other girls after we went to the police,' she said.

She added that the recent police investigation, which resulted in Hughes' conviction last month, was conducted with the 'utmost integrity and professionalism', but said an inquiry was necessary to find out why it took so long to bring charges against the actor.
