FAI chief executive John Delaney has renewed his attack on the ‘unprofessional’ SFA and warned the ticketing row will lead to tensions among rival fans at Celtic Park.

Delaney, however, was immediately criticised by Irish supporters, who accused him of trying to stoke up controversy to mask his own failings in the fiasco.

Ireland have received an official allocation of 3,209 tickets for Friday’s crunch Euro 2016 qualifier — in line with UEFA’s five per cent minimum.

Delaney had demanded more but that was turned down by the SFA, who said there was no room for manoeuvre.

Visiting fans will be dotted throughout the Tartan Army on Friday night after acquiring tickets meant for Scots and Delaney now feels there is the potential for trouble.

‘The SFA has really acted unprofessionally here with us,’ he insisted. ‘They only gave us five per cent of the allocation, telling us the game was sold out when it’s not.

‘It means we’re not able to award tickets to hard-core supporters that we would love to accommodate.

‘The mannerly and common-sense thing to have done was give us 7,000 or 8,000 tickets and allow us to allocate them to Irish supporters in the one section. It was also be the safest thing to do; I have to make that point.

‘Scotland are playing well. This is a derby game, it’s a Friday night in Glasgow and there’ll be tension in the air. To have pockets of Irish fans stuck in Scottish areas is not the correct thing to do.

‘In my 10 years as chief executive, no association has treated us as badly as the Scottish have done on this particular occasion.’

However, that standpoint cut little ice with frustrated Irish fans who insist the way the FAI have distributed their allocation is the real issue.

A statement from supporters group You Boys In Green said Delaney’s comments were ‘deeply unhelpful and do little more than stoke unnecessary tension’.

It added: ‘Both sets of fans have impeccable records for behaviour and have received awards from federations and other bodies for the support of their national sides. We expect both sets of spectators to contribute to a superb atmosphere on Friday night.

‘Once again the chief executive has seen fit to blame the SFA for this saga noting “They only gave us five per cent of the allocation, telling us the game was sold out when it’s not. It means we’re not able to award tickets to hard-core supporters that we would love to accommodate”.

‘YBIG have clearly proved that the FAI system to allocate tickets spectacularly failed, irrespective of the size of the allocation.

‘Many of the hardcore supporters that the chief executive mentions will be sitting with the Scottish supporters are a result of the fact that the FAI have no clear and transparent system in place to allocate tickets.

‘These supporters have acquired “home tickets” for other games due to the same failures in FAI ticketing which occurred here.’

The SFA explained their position last week, stating: ‘Given the demand for tickets from Scotland supporters, and the need to comply with UEFA’s safety and security regulations, we will be unable to increase the Republic of Ireland’s away allocation.’

However, former Republic of Ireland manager Johnny Giles has sided with Delaney and claimed the SFA will have to carry the can if there is any trouble at Parkhead.

‘Anything could happen during the match,’ said Giles.

‘If there is trouble on the night, they will be to blame. And they’ll have to pay the price for that. I can’t understand why the Scottish FA is doing this.

‘Their fans will have to come over here. If the FAI behaved in the same way, the Scottish fans wouldn’t get a fair deal either. We don’t want any of that. But with Irish fans in the Scottish sections, you just don’t know what could happen.’
