Her feisty Avengers alter-ego would have karate-kicked any man who dared patronise her.

But it appears that when it comes to equality of the sexes, Diana Rigg is much less strident in real life.

Despite being an icon to women’s rights campaigners since the Sixties, the 74-year-old actress has denied being a feminist, saying she likes it when a man displays old-fashioned courtesy.

Dame Diana also criticised women for being ‘more bitchy than men’, saying they are ‘dangerous and deeply competitive’.

The actress is best known for playing catsuit-clad spy Emma Peel in Sixties TV series The Avengers.

Her character was hailed by feminists for her intelligence, independence and martial arts skills.

But Dame Diana denied she was a feminist icon, telling the Radio Times: ‘I was thought to be, but never was really.

‘I kept my mouth shut for the most part. It’s a question of economics. If you’re paid the same as a man, which now you are in this profession, you’re equal. If a man holds a door open for me or pulls back a chair so that this old bag can sit down, I’m delighted.

‘If they [men] put an arm round a woman and say, “You look good today”, they could find themselves in the small claims court.

‘Women who moan and carp about that sort of thing are stupid. They find it belittling, but it’s just good manners.’ 

However, she added: ‘You can’t pat bottoms, though. You deserve to be slapped for that. It’s condescending. I wouldn’t allow it.’ 

She said that women are capable of being much more bitchy than men.

‘Most women won’t agree, but it’s true. I love women but am aware we’re dangerous and deeply competitive, although I gave up being competitive long ago. Feminists deny it... but basically it’s all about men and sex.’

Diana Rigg has been an icon to feminists since she starred as Emma Peel in Sixties TV show, the Avengers

Dame Diana is not the first high-profile older woman to criticise women’s rights. A month ago, Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry, 78, was chastised by broadcaster Joan Bakewell for saying feminism was a ‘dirty word’ and that she is ‘thrilled to bits’ when men offer to look after her.

Dame Diana has been married and divorced twice and has one daughter, actress Rachel Stirling, 35. Her roles after The Avengers included playing a Bond girl in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. She was recently in Game Of Thrones.

Yesterday feminist author Ellie Levenson criticised Dame Diana’s comments, saying: ‘All these older women slagging off feminism have benefited enormously from feminism so it’s a shame they hate the word so much. They’ve had education, careers, financial independence and a sex life they are in control of... like it or lump it they’re part of the feminist movement.’
