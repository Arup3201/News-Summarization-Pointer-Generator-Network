Carol E. Levy, a New York real estate agent who calls herself the 'Billion Dollar Broker', has opened up her listed $18 million Manhattan duplex that she shares with her newlywed husband, her three children ... and her ex.

Levy split from her first husband, Chris Lipman - who she married in 1992 and had two daughters, now teenagers - four years ago, and they divorced in 2012.

However Lipman - who worked with his now-ex wife at her firm, Carol E. Levy Real Estate - has refused to leave their marital home inside the prestigious Beresford building on Central Park West until Levy sells it.

'Unfortunately, until he has the funds from the sale of the apartment, he doesn't have the ability to move on,' Levy told ABC's 20/20 program.

But the plot became even more complicated when Levy met Joel Goron, and the two quickly fell in love.

They were married in August, and in December welcomed a son, Chase.

So now Levy and Goron live in the sprawling apartment with their newborn alongside Lipman, and his and Levy's two daughters.

Lipman lives rent-free on the 17th floor in the guest bedroom of the six-bedroom palatial apartment, surrounded by a media room and the kitchen.

Levy lives upstairs in the 18th-floor master suite with Goron, and the children are in nearby bedrooms.

Suffice to say, it's far from an ideal arrangement

'There are some times when his presence there, I do feel, is intrusive on my life,' Levy told 20/20.

'If I am in the kitchen and I want to go in there, and he's there ... I would rather be in the kitchen by myself and not, you know, with my ex-husband there.'

Levys says she is most frustrated with the way her ex separates his food from hers in the shared kitchen, and his cleanliness.

'He marks his food, each of it, with an X,' Levy said.

'He doesn't clean up after himself, and I do pay for the housekeeper. 

'So there is a little resentment there.'

The apartment was appraised for $21 million, according to Levy, but she has reduced the price to $18 million to speed up the sale and fix the situation she is in.

'It'll happen soon,' Levy said. 

'I would say, within the next few months, there should be a deal on it.'

Goron previously told The New York Post that he has come to accept the arrangement, no matter how awkward.

'I do not allow her ex's presence to affect our incredible happiness in any way whatsoever,' Joel said.

'He's merely a speed bump in the road.'

Lipman told the newspaper that he chooses to remain living in the home because it allows to see his daughters each day and he hopes his presence will motivate Levy to push the sale through.

The impressive property - which features city views, sweeping terraces, a grand staircase herringbone floors and two wood-burning fireplaces - came onto the market for $24 million

Carol describes the palatial apartment as 'a wonderful mix of classic pre-war with modern amenities', with a 'magical garden oasis' featuring panoramic views.
