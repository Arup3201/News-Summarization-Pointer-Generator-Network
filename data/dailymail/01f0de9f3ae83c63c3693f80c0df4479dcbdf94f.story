Questions unanswered: Brandon Beaver is believed to have died before he was bitten repeatedly by sharks

A surfer thought to have died in a shark attack had in fact committed suicide, a coroner has found.

The body Brandon Beaver, 42, was found near a beach in San Diego last month, covered in shark bites, and investigators initially believed the predators were the cause of his death.

An autopsy has now revealed that Beaver, from Southern California, committed suicide and was dead prior to the shark attack.

'There was no evidence whatsoever that his death was due to shark attack, as all findings indicated postmortem marine animal activity,' the autopsy reports.

Adding to the intrigue about a 
possible cause of death, NBC San Diego says that the coroner's office 
asserts that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when he 
decided to take off his wetsuit and wrap it around his board.

Mr
Beaver's fiancee said that he did have a history of mental illness- 
including bipolar disorder- and depression, and had suicidal thoughts in
the past.

She said at the time of his disappearance, he was stressed due to financial and familial problems.

Mr Beaver was found dead off the coast in La Jolla, California, in May this year, after his fiancee had reported him missing.

Mr Beaver's surfboard with his wetsuit tied around it was found separately from his body.

'I’ve been doing this 30 years almost
and I’ve never seen someone do that. It’s just a very strange decision 
to make when you’re out on the water,' San Diego Lifeguard Lt. John Everhart told KSWB-TV at the time.

'There was certainly a lot of trauma that was done to the body,' Everthart added.

The man's fiancee, who has not been identified, reported him missing on when he didn't come back from surfing.

A person walking along the shoreline spotted the body around 3:30am on the 9th of May.

Water: Another surfer said he had seen Beaver out on the water at Pacific Beach in San Diego the day before his body was found

Investigation: An autopsy has concluded that the San Diego surfer had drowned before being bitten by sharks

Another surfer told the local news station that he had seen Beaver out on the water the day before.

'I just saw him paddle off shore out there, going north just by himself,' Neil Ratnavara said.

'There were still a few people in the water.  Not too waves, but there was nothing odd about that.'

The county Medical Examiner's office  concluded that Beaver drowned, and that the shark bites came in a 'post-mortem' attack.

'There was no evidence whatsoever that 
his death was due to shark attack, as all findings indicated postmortem 
marine animal activity,' the the San Diego County medical examiner’s 
office concluded.

The coroner found evidence of bites from several different marine animals, including a juvenile Great White.
