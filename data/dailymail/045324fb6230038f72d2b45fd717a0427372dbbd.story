The two men most Manchester United fans wished were still working together at the club were spotted as Sir Alex Ferguson enjoyed a leisurely stroll with David Gill.

The pair appeared to be in good spirits as they walked through Wilmslow on Wednesday afternoon and were perhaps talking about the imminent arrival of Louis van Gaal to Old Trafford.

Van Gaal has taken the World Cup with 
homeland Holland by storm, leading the Oranje to five wins out of five 
ahead of Wednesday's semi-final against Argentina in Sao Paulo.

Ferguson and Gill left United after the Red Devils won their 20th 
Premier League crown at a counter at the end of the 2012/13 season.

However, following the duo's Old Trafford's departures the club's fortunes quickly soon changed.

Ferguson
 and Gill's replacements, David Moyes and Ed Woodward, endured a 
nightmare debut season in their new roles as the red half of Manchester 
finished seventh in the league and without European football next 
season.

Moyes' failure as boss led to his sacking in April with van Gaal set to take charge once Holland's World Cup is over.
