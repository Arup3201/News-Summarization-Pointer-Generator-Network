The expectation on the Willie Mullins stable may have been immense but the Irish champion trainer delivered with interest as two more winners on the final day took his haul to a record eight.

The tally eclipsed the previous record set by Nicky Henderson three years ago.

The only real surprise with the final-day brace was that Vincent O’Brien County Hurdle winner Wicklow Brave, a third winner at the meeting for jockey Paul Townend, was allowed to start at 25-1 as the gelding sauntered home by eight lengths from Sort It Out.

Friday:

Killultagh Vic 7/1 Martin Pipe Jockeys' Handicap Hurdle

It was harder work for Killultagh Vic, the Luke Dempsey-ridden 7-1 shot in the Martin Pipe Conditional Jockeys Handicap Hurdle as he edged home by a head from Noble Endevour.

Mullins said: 'It's been fantastic.

'It's so hard and competitive, but we've had such a fantastic spring. We've had no sickness with any of the horses and we've had a great preparation.'

The trainer was full of praise for Dempsey, who rode brilliantly to hold on to the final win under huge pressure. 

'I thought Luke gave him a great ride,' Mullins said. 'He was beaten and then he pulled it out of the fire.

'It's his first ride for me, as far as I can remember. He was available last week so I booked him.

Mullins finished off the meeting as he started. His bookie clobbering four-timer on day one was headed by Champion Hurdler Faugheen and also included Douvan in the Supreme Novices, Un de Sceaux in the Arkle and Glens Melody in the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle. His other two winners were Vautour in the JLT Novices’ Chase and Don Poli in the RSA Chase.

His successes almost allowed Ireland to beat Britain in the Betbright Prestbury Cup, but the home team edged it 14-13. 

Douvan, ridden by Ruby Walsh, was Mullins' first win of this year's festival on Tuesday
