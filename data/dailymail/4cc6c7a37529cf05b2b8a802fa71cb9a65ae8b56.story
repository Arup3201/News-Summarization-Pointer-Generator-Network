Horse racing pundit John McCririck at Central London Employment Tribunal is suing Channel 4 for age discrimination

And they’re off! The two front-runners in a high-profile legal derby left the starting gate yesterday on the first leg of a £3million compensation dispute.

Out of the trap came flamboyant horse-racing pundit John McCririck, wind in his whiskers, sun glinting off the horse-brass round his neck.

The trademark deerstalker hat was in place, of course, and his colours for this off-the-track event were royal blue (his suit) and scarlet (his pocket handkerchief).

Coming rapidly up the outside were representatives of Channel 4 and IMG Sports Media, whom the ex-TV presenter and former Celebrity Big Brother contestant is suing for alleged age discrimination in what could become the latest in a series of milestone cases.

McCririck, 73, claims he was sacked  without explanation from Channel 4  Racing because they wanted to hire someone younger.

The widely-known tipster maintains the decision to put him out to pasture, so to speak, was based on his age as opposed to his ability to do the job.

Channel 4 and IMG, which took over production of the broadcaster’s racing coverage from the start of this year, robustly reject allegations of ageism and say they will ‘vigorously’ refute the claim.

Thus, in the unlikely setting of a central London employment tribunal, McCririck sat side by side – or neck and neck, as an observer described it – with some of the keenest legal minds in the land.

McCririck is seeking £2.5million in punitive damages and another £500,000 compensation for what he calculates is a loss of future  earnings, career damage, public humiliation, stress and mental anguish.

Claims: John McCririck and his wife Jenny McCririck at Central London Employment Tribunal today

Yesterday the Harrow-educated tipster, sporting a triple-horseshoe buckle on his belt and a selection of gold jewellery, insisted he had launched the case not just for himself, but for oldies everywhere.

‘I am so angry,’ he said outside court. ‘I am saying I was sacked because I was old – I was 72 at the time. But this is a far bigger issue that just me.

‘There are people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s who dread that a younger person will come in and take them out of a job. They are in fear of it.

‘That is why I am claiming £3million in total, so that no-one will ever be sacked because they are trying to get a younger person. On merit and ability – fine; but not because they are younger.’

The ‘suits and skirts’, as he called his ex-bosses, were ‘never answerable to anybody’.

He added: ‘They make their decisions, they can destroy people’s lives and careers, and they are never made answerable. Now they are going to be answerable...’

McCririck arrived at the tribunal with his wife Jenny at his side, his partner for more than 40 years. He affectionately calls her ‘The Booby’, a reference to a gannet-like seabird, apparently.

In contrast to her husband’s outlandish appearance, she blended easily into the busy London street as he spoke to reporters.

Mr McCririck was originally a racing journalist with The Sporting Life and also sub-editor for Grandstand

McCririck is reported to have engaged
lawyers on a no win no fee basis, and to have pledged part of any 
damages to charities fighting prejudice in the workplace.

The ex-Sporting Life journalist made 
his debut as Channel 4’s reporter in the betting ring three decades ago 
and went on to achieve so-called celebrity on reality TV shows, 
including Wife Swap, in which he was partnered with ex-Cabinet minister 
Edwina Currie.

His legal battle is one of a  growing
number of such cases to reach employment tribunals since age 
discrimination was added to the list of eligible claims in 2006.

Two years ago BBC Countryfile 
front-woman Miriam O’Reilly won a widely-publicised case against the 
corporation after she was replaced by younger presenters.

Former newsreader and broadcaster 
Selina Scott reached a  settlement with Channel 5 over  an ageism claim 
in 2008, when she was 57.

Last night the McCririck dispute 
still had the potential to fall at the first fence, however. The 
tribunal has yet to decide whether a full hearing should take place.

The case continues.
