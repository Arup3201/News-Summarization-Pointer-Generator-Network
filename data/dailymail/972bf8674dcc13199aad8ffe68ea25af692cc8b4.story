Second chance: Benefits cheat Gerald Baalham, 41, was accused of 'spitting in the face' of staff at Culford School in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk

A school IT technician who was given his job back despite stealing £56,000 in benefits has used a staff credit card to purchase thousands of pounds worth of computer equipment to sell on eBay.

Gerald Baalham, 41, was given a second chance by management at the £20,000-a-year Culford School in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, after he was convicted of fraud last year.

But he has now been accused of stabbing his fellow employees in the back after spending £32,000 on computers and then selling them over the internet.

He also snapped up £1,000 worth of computer equipment for himself at the school’s expense.

The judge at Ipswich Crown Court accused him of 'spitting in the face' of those who had kept him on, after he was given a 26-week suspended prison sentence for benefit fraud last year.

Judge David Goodin accepted Baalham had become trapped in a 'vicious cycle' of dishonesty which he had found hard to break.

The technician did not use the money to fund and extravagant lifestyle and was shocked when he was informed of all the full amount he had used.

Judge Goodin said: 'It’s plain that you were in my judgement ill. You were under stress and you were dealing with a great deal more than your particular personality was able to deal with.'

Baalham was given a two-year suspended prison sentence, after he was found guilty of abusing his position as head of the IT department. 

He also ordered Baalham to attend a Thinking Skills programme and gave him a 13-week curfew between the hours of 8pm and 6am.

Robert Sadd, prosecuting, said Baalham was in charge of IT at the independent school and was not a teacher.

Mr Sadd said the benefit fraud for which Baalham had been given a suspended prison sentence last year related to his failure to notify the authorities of a change in his circumstances while claiming Disability Living Allowance.

He said that when he was quizzed by police about the computer equipment fraud he had expressed surprise at the amount involved.

Claire Furlong, defending, said Baalham had been a technician at Culford School and was 'out of his depth' when he was promoted to head of department.

Miss Furlong branded his scam 'unsophisticated' and said he had committed the offences after getting into debt.

She said Baalham had suffered a mental breakdown and contemplated suicide.
