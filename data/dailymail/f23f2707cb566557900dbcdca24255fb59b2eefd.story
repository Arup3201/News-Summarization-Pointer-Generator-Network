Ringleader: Jordan Horner, known as Jamal Uddin, pictured arriving at court today where he was one of three men given Asbos banning them from promoting Sharia law for five years

Three religious vigilantes who terrorised innocent members of the public as the self-styled ‘Muslim Patrol’ have been banned from promoting Sharia Law in Britain.

Jordan Horner, 20, Royal Barnes, 23, and Ricardo MacFarlane, 26, were jailed for a total of two years and ten months for touring East London harassing people they deemed to be ‘non-believers’.

The three men were today also slapped with a five-year Asbo banning them from distributing material about Sharia Law to the public, or even meeting each other.

The trio are also banned from associating with controversial preacher Anjem Choudary.

Judge Timothy Pontius admitted the order was ‘drastic’ but added: ‘With the public interest in mind and the safety of individual members of the public in particular, it seems to me essential that these orders should be granted to run for that period of time.’

The leader of the gang, white Muslim convert Horner, who has declared he wants Sharia law in the UK, attacked people drinking in the street and demanded: ‘Remove yourselves now. Muslim Patrol.’

Barnes is a pal of Lee Rigby murderer Michael Adebolajo, and last week admitted making a string of sickening videos celebrating the deadly attack on the soldier in Woolwich.

The order comes in the wake of their convictions for the Muslim Patrol attacks carried out in January last year.

Prosecutor Kate Wilkinson said: ‘The order is designed to act as a much more effective and long-lasting way of making sure the streets of London are protected.’

Of Horner, she said: ‘This is a man with incredibly deep-rooted manifest beliefs with respect of this particular cause.

‘At every opportunity, he appears to manifest this in an unwelcome manner in terms of members of the public.’

She added: ‘They are affiliated with ALM, also known as Muslims Against Crusades, led by Anjem Choudary, underpinning rallies to introduce Sharia Law which they all manifestly participate in.’

Under the Asbo, the three men are 
banned from approaching people in public to promote Sharia Law, or 
distributing leaflets for their cause even if they are outside a mosque.

They are all banned from being meeting each other, as well as Mr Choudary and Dean Le Page, another leading ALM member.

Horner
 is additionally banned from having a loud hailer and going to an 
educational establishment unless he is a student or a relative of a 
student.

Barnes is also banned from distributing videos promoting Sharia Law.

'Muslim Patrol': Royal Barnes, left, and Ricardo McFarlane, right, who toured the streets with Horner harassing people they judged to be breaking strict Islamic codes, were also given the same order

The religious vigilante group’s activities were exposed in YouTube where they denigrated women as ‘slags’ and used a megaphone to scream ‘kill the non-believers’ at innocent bystanders.

Two victims, Joshua Bilton and Anna Reddiford, were told to stop holding hands by Horner and Barnes as they walked down the street in Bethnal Green, East London.

Horner yelled through a megaphone: ‘Let go of each other’s hands. This is a Muslim area!’

In a second incident, on January 6 last year Horner and MacFarlane attacked a group of men drinking in the streets of Shoreditch, east London.

They screamed ‘kill the non-believers’ as Horner punched James Forward in the jaw and knocked out Patrick Kavanagh with a sucker punch to the head.

A week later on January 13 Horner and Barnes confronted another couple, Clare Coyle and Robert Gray, walking in the street in Stepney, east London.

The 23 year-old accused Miss Coyle of dressing inappropriately in a Muslim area and that she would be punished in ‘hell fire’.

Horner then started filming the event on his mobile phone and branded Clare Coyle a ‘slag’, to which she countered: ‘This is Great Britain. I can dress how I wish.’

In the video, which was later uploaded on to YouTube, the group can be heard shouting: ‘You need to control this area and forbid people from exposing themselves outside the mosque.

‘Remove yourselves now. Muslim Patrol. Move away from the mosque. Don’t come back. We don’t respect those who disrespect God.’

The video also includes footage of an injured cyclist after an accident later the same morning.

A voice can be heard claiming the accident was a result of people drinking on a Saturday night, adding: ‘We call you to embrace Islam, become Muslim.’

Preacher of hate: The trio are also banned from associating with controversial cleric Anjem Choudary

Choudary today insisted that Horner, McFarlane and Barnes were 'fine, upstanding members of the community' and called the order banning them from speaking to him 'unjust'.

'I have not been convicted of any crimes, even though I do not believe in the law of this land,' he said. 'I am very proud of these people who study with me. I knew them all. They used to attend my lectures. They are fine, upstanding members of the community, of very good character.

'They just wanted to speak out about the evils of alcohol, prostitution, gambling and drugs and support Sharia law.

'The oppressors are being allowed to reign which is why we are suffering these floods. It is divine punishment from God. The government and judges are trying to curtail my influence.'

In December last year, Judge Rebecca Poulet QC jailed Horner for 68 weeks, MacFarlane for 12 months, and Barnes for 24 weeks.

She told them: ‘One of the many good things about living in Great Britain is the tolerance and respect members of the public generally show to one another’s religious beliefs, his dress or his chosen way of life.

‘When on occasions a person shows their intolerance of another individual whether by aggression or violence and in such a way as to cause real fear to the individual then the law can be invoked to protect that individual.

‘This law would protect you if someone treated you in this way. It is the very same law that now brings you before this court for your conduct.

‘My understanding is that Islam is a peaceful religion and this conduct was unfortunately anything but.

‘You were acting together and very late at night and that conduct in particular frightens people and it frightened them with your aggression.’

Despite receiving the longest sentence of the three, Horner, who has changed his name to Jamal Uddin, has already been released because of time spent in custody waiting for sentencing.

The court heard at sentencing that he has a wife and two young children, and has turned his back on drugs due to his ‘religious calling’.

Barnes is facing up to six-and-a-half years in prison for making the videos about Lee Rigby, including one where he laughed hysterically while driving past the scene of the murder.

The Asbo will take effect from today even though he is likely to remain prison for at least two years.

Horner, of Walthamstow, east London, pleaded guilty to two charges of assault and two charges of using threatening words and behaviour.

He was also jailed for six weeks in July last year for beating up a photographer and causing £3,000 of damage to a car in an attack in Walthamstow, east London.

McFarlane, also of Walthamstow, east London, whose real name is Ricardo Langaigne pleaded guilty to affray, and has previous convictions for criminal damage for painting over advertisements of women in the street.

Barnes, of Hackney, east London, admitted two counts of using threatening words and behaviour, and has previous convictions for theft and handling stolen goods prior his conversion to Islam and also for using threatening words and behaviour on April 2012.
