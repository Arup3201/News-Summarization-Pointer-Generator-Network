The summer of 2013 will be remembered for bringing plenty of welcome sunshine.

But British beach-goers may also have less pleasant memories - as the warm weather has also brought a record season for dive-bombing seagulls.

The reason, according to experts, is that the breeding season has been extended into the summer holidays... and chicks are still around to be protected - and fed.

Invasion of the birdy snatchers: Seagulls attack a young man, who was holding an ice cream, and his friend on a beach in St Ives, Cornwall. The warm weather has brought a record season for the dive-bombing birds

This has combined with an increase in the number of human targets visiting the coast - leading to countless clashes.

The RSPB received over three times as many calls about seagulls last month in the South West compared with July 2012, up from 51 to 173.

This year’s breeding season started out slowly because of the cold weather in March and April but heated up in June and July, culminating in a late feeding frenzy.

An influx of visitors to beaches and resorts, meanwhile, is giving the brazen birds more opportunities to steal from humans.

The reason for the increase in dive-bombing gulls, according to experts, is that the breeding season has been extended into the summer holidays - and chicks are still around to be protected and fed

In Cornwall, tourists face a daily barrage from dive-bombing gulls determined to grab ice creams, pasties and takeaways.

In St Ives, the birds even make their nests directly above restaurants and snack bars and target tourists with ever more aggressive tactics, swooping down at 40mph to wrench away food from anyone foolhardy enough to eat in public.

Seagull expert Peter Rock said the spike in food-snatching incidents is simply down to the bumper breeding season and the added opportunity to steal from tourists.

Mr Rock said: ‘In 2013 we had an exceptionally cold start to the breeding season with a lot of birds postponing their breeding until July and August.

‘We still have young birds waiting to fledge right now. It’s become a protracted breeding season.

‘In past summers, we’ve seen pretty awful weather, but this year some of the weather has been brilliantly sunny and hot.

‘That means a lots of people are on the beach with their food and their ice creams which the gulls are very adept at snatching, in St Ives in particular.

‘They really are very clever. One will swoop down so somebody moves their food away from the incoming bird only to find it snatched by a second bird working in cahoots.’

Matt Thomas, 29, manager of the Cornish Pasty Shop, in the resort, said yesterday: ‘This is by far the worst I have seen the seagulls.

‘We get people coming back to us on a daily basis saying how they’ve had their pasties taken.

‘There are far more of them this year and they are a lot more aggressive. They seem to work in groups and target young children.’

Donna Field, 52, visiting from Hertfordshire, added: ‘The seagulls are awful. They’re extremely aggressive and are really threatening.

‘Yesterday I was sitting eating on the beach when one seagull dived in, bit my hand and took my chicken. It knocked it out of my hand and onto the sand then took the piece.

‘Attacks happen all the time. I saw a little girl have an ice cream taken from her hand. She burst into tears and looked terrified.’

Jake Cashmore, 20, sales assistant at Willy Wallers ice cream parlour, added: ‘Seagulls have always been a problem here but they’re becoming more tactical and are attacking more often.

‘The problem has become so bad that we now warn every customer about them and have signs up in our shop.’

Another possible explanation behind the gulls' extra aggression is that they are becoming ‘drunk’ feasting on flying ants, of which there are record numbers due to the hot weather.

The ants turn to acid in their stomachs and act like alcohol, apparently lowering the birds’ inhibitions and making them ever more bold.

Cornwall Council insists the gulls in St Ives are legally protected members of a wild species and thus cannot simply be culled.

Over the years it has tried various schemes to curb the menace - including ‘bird dispersal units’ who go around playing high-pitched tapes of gulls squawking in distress to scare them off.

Elsewhere in Britain, the urban gull population is growing by 20 per cent a year.

Bristol City Council is using artificial eggs to trick seagulls into thinking they are rearing young to stem a spate of dive-bomb attacks in the city centre.

RSPB spokesman Tony Whitehead said most run-ins between humans and seagulls (St Ives, above) were simply the result of birds innocently trying to protect their chicks

Authorities in Cumbria have introduced a fine for feeding seagulls and wildlife experts in Aberdeen have even tried feeding them contraceptives.

The RSPB has also had to warn against vigilante attacks, with reports of nuisance birds being kicked to death and lured into the paths of cars.

RSPB spokesman Tony Whitehead said most run-ins between humans and seagulls were simply the result of birds innocently trying to protect their chicks.

He said: ‘This is the time of year when chicks begin to hatch. Of course, they remain flightless for some time but this period normally only lasts for a few weeks.

‘During that time, the gulls become very aggressive towards humans.

‘There’s been an increased number of phone calls to us this year, more so than the past eight or so years from the Cornwall area, and we’re not sure why.

‘But once the young have begun to fly, it usually calms down. I think the issue will pass very soon.’
