8.7 million pounds of meat from Northern California have been recalled due to 'diseased and unsound' animals that were not properly inspected and are therefore potentially harmful

The recalled product that failed to have a federal inspection was shipped Jan. 1, 2013 and Jan. 7. 2014.

Rancho Feeding Corporation of Petaluma 'processed diseased and unsound animals and carried out these activities without the benefit or full benefit of federal inspection,' reported a federal agency on Saturday.

8.7 million pounds of meat were recalled for being 'diseased' and potentially harmful for health

Rancho Feeding Corporation failed to have a proper inspection for meat bought from Jan. 1, 2013 and Jan. 7. 2014

On January 13, 40,000 pounds of the company's products were recalled, as detailed by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

'Thus, the products are adulterated, because they are unsound, unwholesome or otherwise are unfit for human food and must be removed from commerce,' said the FSIS.

There were no reported illnesses related to the products which were distributed in California, Florida, Illinos and Texas, reported CNN.

An FSIS spokesman said because some of the products could still be frozen and in storage, a Class I recall was issued because the meat product could cause serious, adverse health consequences.

Included in the Recall were beef carcasses, heads, cheeks, livers, feet, and tongues in 20 pound boxes or larger.

There were also 40-pound boxes of bones and 60 pound boxes of veal trim.

It is unknown as to which companies received the product and whether or not they were shipped to restaurants or stores.
