Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is to return home to the United States early on Friday morning after more than five years in captivity spent with the Taliban.

The deeply controversial POW will land at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio after midnight according to two senior military sources.

He will not make any public appearances ahead of what is being referred to as Phase 3 of his reintegration process and no media will be allowed to witness the former Taliban prisoner's return.

The news that Bergdahl will be returning to the United States was announced at the same time as a pair of letters written by the soldier were leaked to the Daily Beast which offer some explanation why the soldier vanished.

Home ground: Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, pictured moments before being freed by the Taliban, has arrived at a medical center in San Antonio

Since his prisoner exchange for five Taliban prisoners held in Guantanamo, Bergdahl has been recuperating under supervision in the US military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany.

Indeed, according to NBC News, Bergdahl was in sufficiently 'good enough physical condition' to return to the United States before today, but was 'not ready psychologically or emotionally'.

Furthermore, he has still not spoken to his family back in Hailey, Idaho, which canceled a homecoming party for the captured soldier after huge question marks about his desertion and wisdom of the exchange raged.

His fellow soldiers have painted a picture of a comrade who walked away from his post in eastern Afghanistan and the Taliban has alleged that it did not kidnap him - rather they found him wandering aimlessly along a road.

The Pentagon has promised that they will be exhaustive in discovering why he was held for the best part of five years by the Taliban and the Obama administration has defended the decision to free him.

Officials have kept a lid on details of Bergdahl's condition and his travel plans out of concern that he not be rushed back into the public spotlight after a lengthy period in captivity and amid a public uproar over the circumstances of his capture and release.

Bergdahl was released from Taliban captivity on May 31 and has been at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany since June 1.

He was deployed in eastern Afghanistan when he disappeared in June 2009.

In the letters provided to The Daily Beast, Bergdahl writes from a Taliban 'prison', urging his family and the government to postpone judgement regarding the circumstances of his desertion.

He then goes onto explain, in small amounts of detail why he walked away from his base in 2009.

'Leadership was lacking, if not non-existent. The conditions were bad and looked to be getting worse for the men that where actuly (sic) the ones risking thier (sic) lives from attack,' he writes in a letter dated March 23, 2013.

It is one of two letters sent by Bergdahl to his parents and obtained by The Daily Beast.

'If this letter makes it to the U.S.A., tell those involved in the investigation that there are more sides to the cittuwation (sic),' he adds. 'Please tell D.C. to wait for all evadince (sic) to come in.'

According to the publication, The Daily Beast obtained the letters from sources in contact with the Taliban and they have been confirmed to be the same letters delivered by the International Red Cross to Bergdahl's family.

They are the first personal response from Bergdahl himself on the circumstances surrounding his captivity.

The Pentagon declined to comment on the letters or why the soldier left his base.

It said that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has 'already made clear that the Army is going to review the circumstances surrounding his disappearance and captivity,' adding that 'we need to reserve judgment until that process is complete.'

While the handwriting in the letters, one from 2013 and one from 2012 is different, officials who have seen the letters have deemed them to be from the pen of Sgt. Bergdahl.

These sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private correspondence.

The International Red Cross would also not confirm that the letters released to The Daily Beast were the same ones in content that they delivered.

'We do this in a strictly humanitarian capacity and the messages only include family news,' a spokesman said on Tuesday.

The first letter is dated, November 27 and is addressed in care of 'Geneve Red Cross' and claims the sender is 'POW Bowe Bergdahl, US Army Afghanistan War Prison.

The letter is addressed to 'Father Robert Bergdahl, USA'.

'To my friends & family, in regards to the circomestance (sic) here, I am as well as can be here,' he writes. 'I am given food and drink.'

Bergdahl mentions recent rain in Afghanistan and muses about spring back home in Idaho.

Some of the letter is redacted and he continues, 'I pray everyone is well. I think about you all every day. And all the things that happened in my life. I miss you all, but as papa says, God’s will be done. All things happen for a reason.'

He then discusses religion and philosophy, saying, 'All things happen for a reason. Mathematics is full evidence of this. Just because we cannot understand the master equation does not mean it is not there,' he writes.

'Math is God’s code for this Universe and beyond. I miss you all.'

According to sources familiar with the POW's captivity, Bergdahl was held in a cage for weeks at a time by the Taliban, with a hood over his head after two escape attempts in 2011 and 2012.

Bergdahl ends the 2012 letter. 'I pray that you are all safe.' He then adds a drawing of an animal paw—something officials say his family pointed to as a code sign it was him.

In the 2013 letter, Bergdahl acknowledges he knows he is suspected of being a deserter and tries to explain.

'The cercomstance from the begaining of my time in Afghanistan from immedet top to bottom (sic for all errors), where bad for troopers espeshly in my PLT. (Platoon.)

'Orders showed a high disconcer for safty of troopers in the field, and lacking clear minded, logical and commonsense thinking and understanding from the topsides,' he writes.

'The cercomstance showed signs of going from bad into a nightmare for the men in the field. Unexeptable conditions for the men working and risking life every moment outside the wire,' Bergdahl adds.

'There are some risks that are forced to be taken, however it was made clear more than once that clear minded understanding from leadership was lacking, if not non-existent. The conditions were bad and looked to be getting worse for the men that where actuly the ones risking thier lives from attack as well as Afghan ellements.'

Other letters seen by The Daily Beast include those sent by Robert Bergdahl, Bowe's father, in Arabic to his Taliban captors.

Attached to the letter was a photograph of Bergdahl's father Robert and mother Jani.

Robert wears a yellow ribbon on his shirt with his infamous long beard and his mother is veiled out of respect for his captors.

'Of course, we worry about his health and well being,' they write in a 26 November 2012 letter.

Debate: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel listens to a question as he testifies before the House Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, June 11, 2014. The committee is investigating the deal that secured the end of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's five-year captivity

'It has been almost 4 years since we embraced him. Is it possible to see him once again on video?' The Taliban did release another video to them in 2013.

Many have criticized the Obama administration for agreeing to release five Taliban prisoners from detention at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in exchange for Bergdahl. Some of Bergdahl's former Army colleagues have accused him of deserting his post.

Republicans and Democrats questioned the wisdom of releasing the five Taliban members, saying they could return to the battlefield. Administration officials have told Congress that four of the five Taliban officials will likely rejoin the fight.

In congressional testimony Wednesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called the former Taliban government officials 'enemy belligerents' but said they hadn't been implicated in any attacks against the United States. He said Qatar, which has promised to keep the five inside the country for a year, promised sufficient security measures to warrant making the swap for Bergdahl.

Hagel also said Bergdahl was early in the process of recovering from the trauma of captivity. He said that process began with his arrival at Landstuhl on June 1.

'He's being held there because our medical professionals don't believe he's ready. ... This isn't just about a physical situation,' Hagel said. 'This guy was held for almost five years in God knows what kind of conditions. ... This is not just about can he get on his feet and walk and get to a plane.'

Bergdahl has not made any public comment since his release, and Pentagon officials say there is no timeline for arranging his initial contact with the news media.
