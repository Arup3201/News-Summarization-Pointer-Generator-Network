Teresa Newcome-Baker, 37, had lost all hope of seeing her beloved bay cob Quincey again, after he was taken in 2010

A horse has been reunited with his owner, after being discovered 400 miles away from home three years after he was stolen.

Teresa Newcome-Baker, 37, had lost all hope of seeing her beloved bay cob Quincey again, after he was taken in 2010.

The sales representative, from Northamptonshire, said the horse was stolen when she was forced to loan him after she injured her shoulder in a riding accident and was unable to ride.

According to Ms Newcome-Baker, the person who hired the 15-year-old horse never returned him, and despite reporting the matter to the police she couldn't prove she had loaned the animal rather than giving it away.

But just two weeks ago Ms Newcome-Baker received a call from a riding school north of the border in Perth, central Scotland.

They told her that they found a description online of a missing horse that matched Quincey - who they had just bought for thousands of pounds.

Ms Newcome-Baker,, who lives with her partner Kinglsey Underwood, 24, in Woodford, said she had been moved to tears by the news.

She said: 'I injured my shoulder a few years ago and couldn't ride for a while so I decided to loan Quincey out to get some riding.

'But the woman I loaned him to gave me a false name and false contact details and wouldn't give Quincey back. 

'In fact she was a horse dealer and sold him on.

'I contacted the police and gave them evidence of what she was doing but they couldn't do anything and told me I had to go through civil courts.

'We just could not afford that and I thought that was the end of it - my Quincey was gone. 

'But a few weeks ago I got a phone call from these people saying they had my horse.

'I was ecstatic. They didn't ask for payment. They gave me a phone call while I was at work. I sat and cried for 10 minutes, out of shock more than anything.

'I hired a horsebox to go and pick him up. After three years the first thing I wanted to do was to to see him.

'He was immediately his old self again, as soon as he saw his field it was like he had never left. 

'He's not been treated properly but he's still the same Quincey underneath and he's getting back to normal now.

Ms Newcome-Baker said the person who hired the 15-year-old horse never returned him, and despite reporting the matter to the police she couldn't prove she had loaned the animal rather than giving it away. But just two weeks ago Ms Newcome-Baker received a call out of the blue from a riding school north of the border in Perth, central Scotland

'The people who had him have either removed or deliberately scrambled the microchip saying he was mine. 

'So when the riding school got him they had no reason to suspect anything.

'It really was amazing how they found me, and I cannot thank them enough for what they have done.'

Quincey had been sold on to Crieff Hydro Riding School who had bought the horse in good faith.

But when the school's owner Liz Simpson searched the internet and found that a horse identical to their new arrival has been reported stolen they decided to get in touch with Ms Newcome-Baker.

She said the horse was returned - free of charge.

She said: 'Seeing the bond that exists between Teresa and Quincey, even after three years apart, confirmed to us that giving the horse back to the owner was undoubtedly the right thing to do.

'Teresa has had Quincey since he was 14-months-old and he knew who she was when he saw her.

'It really was a very touching moment and we're delighted that Teresa can look forward to happier times, having Quincey back where he belongs.'
