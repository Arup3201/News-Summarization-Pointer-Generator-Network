Even by the madness of football salaries, it is a staggering sum of money.

Little-known even to fans of his new club until yesterday, Colombia’s Radamel Falcao last night became the highest-paid player in English football after joining Manchester United on loan.

And his eye-watering salary, understood to be at least £300,000-a-week, is also likely to mean a new bonanza for the city’s shopping boutiques thanks to big-spending Coleen Rooney – as her husband Wayne is said to be in for a pay rise to match it.

Making waves: Falcao, 28, and his glamorous Argentinian singer wife Lorelei Taron, 26, were pictured enjoying the beaches of Miami back in June 

The newly-crowned England captain’s current £230,000-a-week contract is rumoured to contain a clause dictating that he must be the Old Trafford club’s highest earner.

Even the most extravagant footballer’s wife is surely going to have their work cut out spending that sort of windfall – although the 28-year-old infamously flew out to Brazil for this summer’s World Cup with an astonishing 15 suitcases in tow for herself and sons Kai, four, and Klay, one.

It remains to be seen whether she will find competition in Falcao’s glamorous Argentinian singer wife Lorelei Taron, 26.

The couple, who met at an evangelical church when Falcao was playing in Buenos Aires, were pictured enjoying the beaches of Miami back in June along with baby daughter Dominique Garcia.

Falcao, 28, who did not play for Colombia during the tournament due to knee ligament damage, only joined French club Monaco last year for a colossal £50million.

He yesterday agreed to a reported £15million season-long loan deal at Manchester United, who have struggled so far this season despite replacing sacked David Moyes with former Dutch national coach Louis van Gaal.

Football pundits had speculated that the club would struggle to attract the biggest names after failing to qualify for the lucrative UEFA Champion’s League this season, but Falcao’s breath-taking salary is likely to have proved a more than adequate consolation for leaving the tax haven of Monaco for England.

Arsenal fan Piers Morgan tweeted: ‘When United told Falcao they were in Europe, did he realise they meant only geographically?’

Cross-town rivals Manchester City had been favourites to land his services, while only on Saturday Falcao himself posted - and later deleted - a tweet appearing to confirm a move to Real Madrid, underlining the ferocious negotiations going on behind the scenes.

Even based on a conservative estimate of £300,000 a week, his earnings break down as £42,857 a day, £1,785 an hour or £29 a minute.

Fellow new recruit Angel di Maria, who signed last week from Real Madrid for a British record £59.7m, is understood to be taking home only marginally less, at £280,000-a-week.

By comparison, the players generally regarded as the finest in the world, Argentina’s Lionel Messi and Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo, who both play in Spain, are understood to be paid £292,000 and £288,000-a week respectively.

Travelling in style: The Colombian striker arrived in Manchester yesterday to sign the deal in a private jet 

Not least among those eagerly anticipating the hoped-for cascade of wealth will be the estate agents of the North West, with the two South Americans joining other new signings Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw staying at Manchester’s Lowry Hotel until they find homes commensurate with their earnings.

Falcao’s father, Radamel García, was a Colombian star of the 1970s, naming his son after a legendary Brazilian footballer.

Now a devout Christian, the youngster was nicknamed ‘El Tigre’ – The Tiger – after joining Argentinian side River Plate when he was 15 for his tenacity, meeting his future wife there when he was 18.

He and the club’s other new signings will have a long way to go to match 28-year-old Rooney’s overall wealth however, now put at £60million thanks to lucrative endorsements from Harper Collins, Nike, EA Sports and Coca-Cola.

As for Mrs Rooney, her husband’s rumoured pay rise could see her forced to make more Twitter retorts to those who brand her extravagant, as with her response to criticism of the mountain of luggage she took to Brazil.

‘There are more people in my party than me and the kids,’ she wrote. ‘Nappies, formula milk, toys, bottles, wipes, and a lot of clothes to stay to the end of the tournament!! I have faith and support my country!!’

The orgy of spending running up to the closure of last night’s transfer window by English clubs was last night on course to smash the £1billion barrier for the first time over the calendar year, fuelled by the Premier League’s colossal £5.5 billion television rights deal.

Passenger: After touching down, he was taken to United's training ground at Carrington to put pen to paper
