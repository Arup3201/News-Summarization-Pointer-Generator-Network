Some of Britain's most iconic Victorian and Edwardian structures are under threat of falling into a state of severe disrepair, a public survey has revealed.

The Victorian Society has published a 
list of the 10 most threatened buildings after calling on the public to 
highlight cases at-risk heritage buildings in England and Wales.

Among the threatened structures are an ivy-shrouded cemetery chapel, a London street scheme and a reservoir 'spillway' resembling an immense staircase.

Also on the list of most at-risk 
buildings from the period are a rare early railway station, a former 
county hall and an abandoned church which have all fallen into a state 
of disrepair.

The society said the solutions for the buildings varied, with some requiring the local authority to step in to protect them and others needing a rethink of plans for them.

Most need urgent action, the organisation said.

Chris Costello, director of the Victorian Society, said: 'The public responded enthusiastically to our call for threatened buildings.

'It shows the public cares - but it also shows there are still too many historic buildings at risk, without recognition or protection.

'Whether the solution is restoration or finding a new use for a building, it always takes money and often a long time.

'In the meantime itâ€™s vital that historic buildings are secured against weather and vandals. We owe it to future generations to ensure such memorable buildings are still around in 100 years.'

The Victorian Society is calling on the public to help in protecting historic buildings.

under private ownership

pumphouse which originally contained a steam engine to operate the locks
but has become derelict

A Grade II listed spillway that resembles a giant staircase. Designed to allow the release of water during heavy rain. It is the only
listed spillway in the UK but is under threat from plans for a concrete
replacement

A Grade II building which once boasted wood
panelling and stained glass windows, but has been at the mercy of 
vandals, thieves and squatters since being sold to a private owner, the 
Victorian Society said

Art Nouveau stained glass windows which was closed and abandoned in the
1980s and now faces a bleak future with no obvious viable use

A Grade II church which 
was abandoned 20 years ago and now has rotten wood floors, crumbling 
stonework and a weathercock which was damaged by a low-flying Chinook

activities and classes, but which has become prey to vandals and 
arsonists since it closed in 1986

A meeting place of six roads which terminate at
a statue of Prince Albert suffered Second World War damage that led to 
buildings being demolished. There are plans for a layout redesign which 
the Victorian Society opposes
