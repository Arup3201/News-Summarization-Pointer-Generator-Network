A transgender woman unhappy with her masculine features has revealed that she sold her house in order to finance a £15,000 surgical makeover.

Jenny Bowman, 56, had been left frustrated by the size of her nose and 
masculine jawline before discovering a procedure called facial feminisation surgery after an online search.

The operation, which softens and feminises the features, isn't available on the NHS but fed up with her masculine looks, she took the dramatic step of putting her house on the market to pay for it.

After selling her three bedroom, semi-detached 
Cambridge home, Jenny underwent extensive surgery to reshape her nose, forehead and jawline.

Jenny, who was born a boy named Paul, had always felt herself to be a woman trapped in a man's body and began secretly wearing female clothes as a young adult before deciding to live as a woman full-time in her late thirties but lacked confidence because of her looks.

'Since having facial feminisation surgery, I’ve never looked back,' she said. 'It’s been worth every penny as I’m just so much more confident now.

'It meant so much to me that I sold my house to have the operation and I’d do the same again. I think many others in my position would go to the same lengths.

'Some of the changes have been small, but they’ve made such a difference to me. I feel so much better when I look in the mirror.'

Miss Bowman was in theatre for six hours as surgeons reconstructed her nose, forehead and jawline, during the 2009 operation at Highgate Private Hospital in London.

She was so pleased with the outcome that she became a full-time ambassador for Facial Team, a group of surgeons who perform the surgery across the globe. 

She now provides support to scores of surgery candidates worldwide and has even observed operations firsthand.

'It’s made such a difference to me,' she added. 'Before, I never wanted anyone to see me in profile, as I thought I looked too masculine, whereas now I feel much more comfortable.

'However,
I think it’s important that transgender people are realistic about the 
results - the surgeons don’t have a magic wand and sometimes the changes
can be very subtle.

'But 
I’ve worked with some younger people to whom it’s made an absolutely 
massive difference - it’s better to get facial feminisation surgery at a
young age, if possible.

Future: Jenny says she hopes that facial feminisation surgery will one day be available on the NHS

'We call these women "invisible" transgenders, because it’s virtually impossible to tell they were born in male bodies.'

A former car salesperson, Miss Bowman first suspected that she was a woman trapped in a male body when she was just seven.

She struggled with her identity for almost 30 years, joining a rugby team as a young man in a bid to fit in with her male peers.

She was in a marriage for several 
years, which led to the birth of a daughter, but the relationship broke 
down as she attempted to come to terms with her situation.

'From an early age, I knew that I wanted to be a girl but, back then, these things weren’t talked about.

'I
felt lucky to have met a lovely woman and I genuinely do think I was in
love with my wife, but the desire to be the woman you feel like inside 
never goes away.

'After my marriage broke down, I realised I couldn’t go on as I was. When
I decided to go out dressed as a woman for the first time, I was 
terrified. I was trembling so much I didn’t think I’d make it past the 
front door.

'But in the end it was a really liberating experience. Becoming Jenny felt like being reborn.'

Miss Bowman, who is single, moved to a rented cottage in Newmarket, Suffolk, after selling her property in June 2009 to pay for her operation.

Despite her extensive surgery, she has no plans to have a full sex change. She believes facial feminisation surgery should one day be available on the NHS, as is currently the case with conventional gender reassignment surgery.

'Looking to the long term, it would be great if facial feminisation surgery was eventually available on the NHS,' she explained.

'It would be very costly, in terms of carrying out the operations and putting doctors through the relevant qualifications.

'But this isn’t just an aesthetic thing - many women like me feel that they need this surgery in order to achieve integration.'
