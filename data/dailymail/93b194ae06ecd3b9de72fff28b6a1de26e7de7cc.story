A 24-year-old U.S. woman has been arrested for creating a live child porn show and screening it to a British man over the internet.

A joint investigation by the FBI and Interpol led to the arrest of Misty Reneedawn Wofford at her Texas home on Thursday.

She is alleged to have forced a three-year-old girl to expose her genitals on the webcam being watched by Paul Hanlon at his home in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Details of the child porn show were discovered when 25-year-old Hanlon was arrested on suspicion of distributing indecent images over the internet.

A search of his computer revealed the name and location of Wofford as well as details of their discussion of using the three-year-old girl in their chats via Skype.

The girl was the daughter of a couple Wofford was staying with in Webster, Texas.

Detectives from the Lothian and Borders Police in Scotland alerted Interpol who in turn handed over details to the FBI.

Wofford was tracked down to her friend's apartment in Webster and arrested on child porn charges.

She is alleged to have admitted that Hanlon encouraged her 'to do many things' to the child but she had never sexually assaulted her.

Wofford also allegedly admitted exposing the child's genitals and nipples over the webcam.

Detective David Nettles with Webster Police said: 'Information on Hanlon's computer allowed us to exact a search warrant.

'Mr Hanlon was held by Lothian and Borders Police on suspicion of distribution of indecent images.

'TA preview of the contents of his computer showed conversations of a disturbing nature and allowed us to obtain a search warrant for Wolford's home.'

Police did not say if the parents of the three year old girl were aware their daughter was being filmed.

Wofford is charged with encouraging the sexual performance of a child, a third-degree felony punishable by up to ten years in prison.Â 

She is currently in the Harris County Jail. Bail was set at $30,000.

Prior to her arrest she posted on Facebook: 'Things don't always work out how you plan them, but they DO work out how they are supposed to!'
