Fans of a mixed-martial arts fighter who allegedly brutally beat his porn star ex-girlfriend have shared a picture of her out and about in an attempt to discredit her claims.

A supporter of Jonathan 'War Machine' Koppenhaver, the fighter accused of savagely beating Christina Mackinday in her apartment on August 8, shared the image on Twitter on Sunday.

The Twitter user, @Grenade_112, wrote that the picture revealed that Mack was 'good enough to go parting a couple nights ago' and claimed the image showed her outside a club.

The image was originally taken in Las Vegas and shared by another Twitter user, who is not part of the 'Free War Machine' group.

Mackinday, who is also known as Christy Mack, responded to @Grenade_112 to confirm that the picture was her, adding: 'I'm not sure that picking up food in our sweat pants is "a night on the town".'

Spotted: Christina Mackinday, who was allegedly beaten by her ex-boyfriend, MMA fighter War Machine, was pictured out and about a few days ago. War Machine's supporters said it showed she was a liar

The adult movie star, who previously shared images showing her swelled and bruised face following the attack, told the Twitter user that she had gone out to get ice cream.

'You can see the damage to my face even in the dark. And I can't drive myself,' she wrote. 'I get out about once a day for a little bit. It's depressing staying in 1 room sleeping all day.'

The supporters of War Machine have turned on Mack on social media, accusing the alleged victim of lying about her extensive injuries and posting images of her home, Fox8 reported. 

Police had issued a warrant for Koppenhaver's arrest and, after a week on the run, he was caught at a hotel in the Simi Valley in California. He remains in jail, awaiting extradition to Nevada.

Ms Mack, 23, told police that the 'War Machine' showed up unannounced at her home and let himself in with a key. There, he found her and a friend, Corey Thomas, sleeping.

She said Koppenhaver began beating Thomas, before sending him away with the threat that he would have friends kill him if he reported the assault.

Ms Mack told Las Vegas police that the fighter then turned his attention to her and started attacking her and wanted to rape her.

According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver.

Ms Mack, an adult film actor, said she escaped, naked, out of a back door when the fighter went to the kitchen, where she thought he was fetching a knife.

She later posted a statement online that she feared for her life when Koppenhaver allegedly sawed off her hair with a dull knife.

Injuries: After the alleged attack at her apartment on August 8, Mack posted pictures of her horrific injuries online; after she shared the images, police put out a warrant for War Machine's arrest

She wrote: 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning (August 8), Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego.

Caught: War Machine was eventually tracked down to a hotel in Simi Valley after a week on the run

'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me.

'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating.

'My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in two places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.'

Ms Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth. 

She added: 'He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly.' 

Her supporters have raised more than $85,000 for her care and a dentist offered to give her free dentures until her teeth can be fixed.

After she put the graphic images online on August 11, the authorities issued a warrant for War Machine and he became the subject of a manhunt. He was eventually tracked down to the hotel.

The pair had dated on and off again for 15 months and War Machine accused her of cheating on him, police documents state.

Prosecutors in Las Vegas filed multiple felony, battery, assault and coercion charges against Koppenhaver. If convicted, it could land him in prison for more than 25 years. 

Claims: War Machine took to Twitter to insist that he had intended to propose to Mack but ended up 'fighting for my life'. On August 8 (the message seen bottom), the day of the alleged attack, he wrote he must be cursed

But Koppenhaver, who legally changed his name to War Machine, and his supporters insist that he was defending himself in the August 8 incident.

'I'm not a bad guy,' he wrote on Twitter on August 10. 'I went to surprise my gf, help her set up her show and to give her an engagement ring and ended up fighting for my life.'

He added: 'I only wish that man hadn't been there and that Christy & I would be happily engaged. I don't know y I'm so cursed. One day truth with come out.'

He is scheduled to appear in Ventura County Superior Court on September 2.
