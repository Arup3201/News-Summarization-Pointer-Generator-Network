Big payout: An Essex secondary school pupil received over £15,000 in compensation after his eyebrow was slightly cut by a DVD case thrown to him by a teacher

A schoolboy was awarded £15,197 in compensation after he sustained a 'tiny cut to the eyebrow' when a teacher threw a DVD case to him.

The plastic case accidentally hit the secondary school pupil in the head, with the boy’s family successfully claiming the five-figure pay-out from Essex County Council.

The council said the member of staff was attempting to pass the DVD cover to the pupil but 'unintentionally threw it with more force than expected and it accidentally hit him'.

It said: 'The damages were agreed in accordance with the guidelines of the Judicial College Guidelines.

'The claimant suffered a scar which was permanent and represented a moderate cosmetic deformity.'

The council paid out £7,900 for the family's solicitors' legal costs, £6,750 in damages and £547 in NHS costs.

Critics have 
now complained of a ‘compensation culture’ in Essex schools.

In total £65,586 of taxpayers' money was awarded by Essex council to pupils that successfully sued over injuries between 2011 and 2013, including one who received £16,812 after hurting his hip falling on wet stairs, according to The Sun.

Essex teachers are suing schools, too.

Thirty-four payouts were handed to injured teachers in the county between 2011 and 2013 – and who received a total of £1.05million.

One teacher was awarded £230,000 after he slipped on a sachet of tomato ketchup in a school corridor.

He suffered severe injuries in the fall as he was walking out of the staff room at a secondary school in Essex.

The personal injury claim was settled outside court by council chiefs who believed they may have been forced to shell out up to £500,000 including legal fees if the case had gone ahead.

The teacher in the ketchup incident was hurt on March 18 2008, but did not file a claim until March 10 2011 – just eight days before the three-year legal time limit for making personal injury claims.

A Freedom of Information request revealed that the council agreed a final settlement of £230,000 in April last year, including £90,000 in damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity as well as damages for losses such as those relating to earnings and pension.

The payout also included £120,000 for the teacher’s legal fees and £20,000 in other costs.

Other claims to emerge include a £110,000 settlement to a member of staff who suffered a spinal injury after slipping on a wet floor on two separate occasions on the same day.

Another employee received £39,450 after suffering a wrist injury when a faulty metal door swung open when they were taking plates to a cupboard.

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, argued that legal battles at school are affecting the quality of teaching.

He said: ‘The compensation culture appears to be more common in the school yard than a grazed knee. Wasting taxpayers’ money on unnecessary pay-outs leaves less money available for teaching and higher tax bills for everyone else.

‘Legal costs on top of the actual pay-outs only add to the overall bill and the whole process undermines the ability of teachers to actually teach. It’s time schools resisted unscrupulous claims before teachers are unable to leave the staffroom for fear of the school being sued.’

However, Jerry Glazier, the National Union of Teachers representative for Essex, said there is no compensation culture in schools.

He said: ‘We need to see these claims in context.

'As a union we will support members who pursue claims for personal injury when we feel they have been poorly treated by management in schools.

‘Schools are generally very safe environments but employers have a duty of care to protect both teachers and pupils.’

Essex County Council added that it takes ‘health, safety and wellbeing’ seriously and that all compensation claims are investigated and damages paid if the authority is liable.
