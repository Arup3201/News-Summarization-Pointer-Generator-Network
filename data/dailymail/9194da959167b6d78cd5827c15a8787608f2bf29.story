Blackpool fans have taken to the to Comedy Carpet in front of Blackpool Tower to protest against club chairman Karl Oyston.   

A flash mob of around 300 fans formed a human 'Oysten Out' sign in a bid to put their point across and send a damning message to the club's hierarchy. 

The Championship club fielded five trialists during a 4-0 win against Penrith on Saturday as the club struggle with a debilitated squad of players and have been forced to cancel their pre-season tour in Spain.

Upset: The Tangerine Army want Chairman Karl Oyston out of their club

Oyston downplayed Blackpool's shortage of players recently, claiming a number of new players were set to arrive at the club.

He told the club's official website: 'I see absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be able to recruit sufficient numbers and quality to be able to compete in The Championship.

'The main thing people want to see is players signing for us and I think once we get some signed, and everything settles down, then we’ll soon forget about some of the problems.

'We’re finding it difficult to land some of the players we’ve been chasing. That’s always the case, but unfortunately it’s with backdrop of not having many players, so it probably focuses things a little more than would normally be the case.'
