Revellers were forced to wait until to 12.04am to celebrate the New Year in Manchester city centre after a tram delayed the firework display.

More than 15,000 people who had crammed into the city's Piccadilly Gardens to see in 2015 were told it had been delayed after the Metrolink tram pulled into the 'fallout zone'.

Organisers said the display could not go ahead until the train had been moved, because it was in the catchment area of where debris could fall and therefore not safe.

Organisers told the 15,000-strong crowd that the New Year firework display could not go ahead until the train had been moved, because it was in the catchment area of where debris could fall and therefore was not safe

The crowd in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens were forced to wait until the tram was moved out of the way

The event host could be heard over the microphone telling the patient crowd that there was 'just a small hitch' after the display failed to start at midnight.

Families had gathered in the city centre square from 10pm to watch the display but couldn't start their celebrations until the tram issue was resolved at 12.04am.

Over the microphone, the event host told the crowd: 'Just a small hitch, we're just waiting for a tram to pull out.

'Get out of the way of the fireworks, Mr Tram.

'As soon as the tram goes out the fireworks will go off.

'We going to give you 10 seconds to get out of Piccadilly Mr Tram.'

The crowd then counted down from 10 to 1 before cheering, yet they were forced to wait in the cold for several more minutes before the issue was rectified.

The host later joked: 'You're all welcome to come next year, but there's no trams coming.'

At 12.04am when the tram had finally been moved from the station, he told the crowd: 'Right, countdown. This is for real now,' before the fireworks erupted over the night sky.

Organisers said the Metrolink tram (like the one pictured) pulled into the 'fallout zone' and the display had to be put on hold until it had been moved because it could be caught by debris and was therefore not safe

The display was eventually given the go-ahead at 12.04am, meaning the crowd had to wait four minutes

Patrick Karney, Manchester council's city centre spokesman, said the delay 'added to the excitement'.

He told Manchester Evening News: 'It was a fabulous Manchester crowd, the biggest we've ever had for a firework display.

'The tram delay added extra excitement and suspense to the occasion. I'll leave it to the transport authority to check what happened.'

It is not known why the tram pulled into the Piccadilly station, but it is thought the drivers were warned about the firework display prior to the New Year event.

Manchester police said the event, which was funded by the owners of the city's big wheel, was a peaceful affair with just two arrests in the vicinity - one for being drunk and disorderly and another for breach of the peace.

One of Britain's remotest communities will not celebrate the New Year until nearly two weeks after the rest of the country - because it still adheres to an ancient calendar for the festivity.

Foula in Shetland is still to even celebrate Christmas.

It marks Christmas and New Year according to the feast days of the old Julian calendar - Yule on January 6 and Newerday on January 13.

The community of just over 30 on the tiny Shetland island has a strong Norse tradition of folklore, music and special festivities. Its inhabitants were the last to speak Norn, a form of old Norse which died out around 1800.

Islanders, including six children, will gather in one house to celebrate Christmas where they will exchange gifts and greetings.

Jim Gear, 71, who was born on the island, said: 'Islanders have celebrated these days every since the Georgian Calendar.

'We have carried this long for a long time - it is part of our tradition.

'We are not unique - other parts of the world still celebrate the old calendar. When New Year comes we will visit each others' houses.'

The island is three-and-a-half miles long by two-and-a-half miles wide.

At one point, Foula - which lies 15 miles west of mainland Shetland and 100 miles north of mainland Scotland, on the same latitude as southern Greenland - sustained 287 people.

Foula got running water in 1982 and full electricity by 1984, supplied by a diesel generator. It currently has a renewable energy system - mainly photo voltaic - backed up by diesel.

The isle is so remote and prone to the weather that attempts by the last Church of Scotland minister, the Rev. Tom Macintyre, to reach it for one Christmas service had to be abandoned after three attempts. 

Foula - meaning 'bird island' in old Norse - was the location for the film The Edge of the World. The RMS Oceanic was wrecked on the nearby Shaalds of Foula.
