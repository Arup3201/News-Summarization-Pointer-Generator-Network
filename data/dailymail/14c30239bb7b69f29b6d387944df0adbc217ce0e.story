Accused: Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena allegedly mutilated a woman after she gave birth in November 2012

A doctor and a second man facing the UK's first prosecution linked to alleged female genital mutilation have denied any wrongdoing.

Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, from the Whittington Hospital in north London, is accused of having carried out the procedure on a woman who gave birth in November 2012.

Appearing at the Old Bailey today, he denied having committed an offence under the Female Genital Mutilation Act.

A second man, who cannot be named, also denied aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the doctor to commit the offence.

He also entered a not guilty plea to encouraging the commission of an offence.

The men will face trial on January 13 at Southwark Crown Court. 

Both the men, wearing dark suits, stood in the dock of oak-panelled Court Two as Mr Justice Sweeney released them on unconditional bail.

He told them: 'Your unconditional bail is continued. You must attend court on each occasion that you are required to between now and your trial.'

The first count on the indictment alleges that Dr Dharmasena committed FGM on November 24, 2012, and that the second man aided or abetted him. 

The second count alleges that the second man encouraged the doctor to commit FGM.

Trial: Both men pleaded not guilty in a hearing at the Old Bailey today. They face a full trial in January
