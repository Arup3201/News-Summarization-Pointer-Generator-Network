Florida, Dubai, Las Vegas are today’s Premier League footballers’ holiday destinations of choice. But 100 years ago, World War One descended across Europe, taking the sportsman of England — with varying degrees of rapidity — to the killing fields of France and Belgium.

Earlier this year a delegation of English football luminaries stood in a cold, windswept corner of northern France. They saw Lochnagar Crater where Second Lieutenant Donald Bell, a full back with Bradford Park Avenue, won his Victoria Cross.

He had filled his pockets with grenades and attacked an enemy machine-gun post. Writing home, he said of his deliverance: ‘I am glad I have been so fortunate for Pa’s sake, for I know he likes his lads to be top of the tree.

Hard life: Offices and men play a game of football during the war

Respect: Living and playing conditions were a whole lot different to the ones modern footballers now have

First class: No expense is spared for the current crop of footballers these days

He used to be always on about too much play and too little work, but my athletics came in handy this trip. We are out of the trenches at present and I am perfectly fit. The only thing is I am sore at elbows and knees with crawling over limestone flints. I believe that God is watching over me and it rests with him whether I pull through or not.’

Five days after his bravery won him football’s only VC of the Great War, he undertook a similarly brave raid and died, aged 25. His letter had yet to reach England. Bell’s wife of one month, Rhoda, was presented with his medal by King George V.

But, for all its many conspicuous war heroes, football’s reluctance to stop playing as the conflict started damaged the sport’s standing in public esteem. More of that later.

The first shot of what turned into war came with the assassination in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914 of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg Empire. Yet the 38,000 spectators at the two-day Eton-Harrow cricket match were more concerned with the state of the pitch than the affairs of mainland Europe.

Soon, however, cricketers had hung up their pads to fight. A remarkable 34 first-class cricketers died during four years of fighting that started on August 4, 1914. One of those was Percy Jeeves of Warwickshire. 

He was a fast-medium bowler, tipped on the evidence of just one sighting by Plum Warner — the Middlesex captain and one of the most important cricket figure of the age — as a future England player.

But it was another Plum who gave Jeeves immortality. PG Wodehouse saw Jeeves play for Hawes CC in Yorkshire and thought the name perfect for a resourceful valet, hence Jeeves and Wooster. The real Jeeves was 28 when he died at High Wood near Montauban on July 22, 1916.

WG Grace: Regarded as the inventor of modern batting. Scored 1098 Test runs for England between 1880 and 1899.

Colin Blythe: One of the best bowlers of his generation. More than 2500 wickets for Kent and 100 in 19 Tests.

Ronald Poulton-Palmer: England rugby captain and wing.

Arthur Wilson: Won silver at the 1908 Olympics with the British rugby union team.

Richard Garnons Williams: Welsh forward who played in his country’s first international rugby match in 1881 — his only game for the national side.

Noel Chavasse: Ran the 400m for Britain at the 1908 Olympics.

Tony Wilding: New Zealander who won Wimbledon four times.

Georges Boillot: First driver to win the French Grand Prix twice.

Donald Bell: Bradford PA footballer, given the Victoria Cross for outstanding bravery.

Sandy Turnbull: Scot who scored the only goal in Man Utd’s 1909 FA Cup final win.

Others to perish were Colin Blythe of Kent and England, whose memorial stands at St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, and AEJ Collins, who is famed for scoring the world record 628 in a house match, at Clifton College in 1899.

The war also accounted for WG Grace. The most famous sportsman of Victorian England, suffered a fatal heart attack when a Zeppelin dropped a bomb on his patio in 1915.

It was Grace’s intervention, along with the heavy death toll of the Battle of Mons, that brought a cessation to the cricket season after initial opposition from government and the MCC, who decreed that ‘no good purpose can be served at the moment by cancelling matches’.

Yet the position was becoming unsustainable. Grace wrote in a letter to The Sportsman: ‘The time has arrived when the country cricket season should be closed, for it is not fitting at a time like this that able-bodied men should be playing cricket by day... I should like to see all first-class cricketers of suitable age set a good example and come to the help of their country without delay in its hours of need.’

The last first-class cricket match was played at Hove on September 2. The MCC declared ‘the continuation of cricket is hurtful to the feelings of a section of the public’.

First-class cricket resumed in 1919. By then 210 cricketers had fought, including the Indian Hardit Singh Malik, the ‘flying hobgoblin’, an Oxford golf blue, who wore his flying helmet over his turban.

The spirit that sportsman took on to the battlefield was usually inculcated in the public schools, the mood of which was summed up in Henry Newbolt’s poem: And England’s far, and Honour a name/ But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks:/‘Play up! Play up! And play the game!’

In their book Public Schools and the Great War, Anthony Seldon and David Walsh tell the story of Captain Billie Neville, of the East Surrey Regiment, a former captain of hockey and cricket and head boy at Dover School, who bought four footballs for each of his platoons so they could kick their way across No Man’s Land. Neville was as relaxed about the war as he might have been about a house match.

Legend: WG Grace was a batting sensation for England during the 19th century

In a letter to his parents he said: ‘As I write the shells are fairly haring over; you know one gets sort of bemused after a few million. Still, it’ll be a great experience to tell one’s children about.’ Aged just 21, he died on July 1, 1916 at Carnoy, yards in front of the German wire.

Valour took many forms. Noel Chavasse, who ran for Britain in the 400metres at White City in London’s 1908 Olympics, was the son of an Anglican bishop and graduated from Oxford. He is also one of only three men to have been awarded the VC twice — for saving lives.

‘His courage and self-sacrifice were beyond praise,’ read the citation in The London Gazette of his first VC, when he treated wounded soldiers at Guillemont in sight of the enemy.

That evening he searched No Man’s Land for four hours. The following day he rescued three people from a shell hole 25 yards from the German trenches.

As the current edition of the Olympian newsletter reports, the citation read: ‘Although he was severely wounded while carrying a wounded soldier to the dressing station, he refused to leave his post and for two days not only continued to perform his duties but went round repeatedly under heavy fire to search for and attend to the wounded.’

Chavasse suffered a severe stomach injury when a shell exploded at an aid post, and died on August 4, 1917, aged 32.

Brilliant:  Colin Blythe was one of the best bowlers of his generation

Rugby’s deceased included Ronnie Poulton-Palmer, the England captain and wing who had scored four tries against France in 1914. He was one of 26 England internationals to perish. 

Thirty Scottish rugby internationals died. Rugby was responsible for founding one of the most distinguished sporting battalions, Mobbs’ Own, the idea of England back Edgar Mobbs, drawn from Northampton and Bedford. The Mobbs Memorial Match is still played to this day between the British Army and the Northampton Saints.

From other sports, Tony Wilding, the New Zealander who won the Wimbledon gentleman’s singles four times, died. Grand Prix racing driver Georges Boillot, of France, was shot down in a dogfight against five German Fokkers. He crashed near Bar-le-Duc and died of the injuries.

Football matches were played by soldiers, occasionally of opposing sides, as at Christmas in 1914, which prompted the current FA to commission a floodlit pitch to be built at Ypres. But, back home, our national sport had a mixed war. Of course many men contributed greatly to the war effort, but not immediately.

Speaking to an Army battalion, Field Marshall Lord Roberts of Kandahar summed up a growing anger at football’s slowness in abandoning its fixture list, saying: ‘I respect and honour you more than I can say. How different is your action from that of the men who can still go on with their cricket and football, as if the very existence of our nation were not at stake.’ 

Champion: Tony Wilding won the prestigious Wimbledon on four occasions

The FA Cup and top two divisions played on. There was even the ‘Khaki Cup Final’ in 1915, so called because of the number of soldiers attending in uniform. But when the Earl of Derby presented the Cup to Sheffield United, who beat Chelsea, he declared it was everybody’s duty to ‘play a sterner game for England’. Football stopped.

The primacy of the war effort had been understood more readily over the border at Hearts, where the manager John McCartney started up a Pals’ Battalion on November 26, 1914. He said: ‘Now then, young men, as you have followed the old club through sunshine and rain, roll up in your hundreds for King and Country, for right and freedom. Don’t let it be said that footballers are shirkers and cowards.’

Three of the Hearts team — Harry Wattie, Duncan Currie and Ernie Ellis — died on the first day of the Somme offensive on July 1, 1916.

But damage to football’s good name had already been done, denting its status as the principal winter sport of the public schools.

By 1929, the number of public and grammar schools affiliated to the RFU had more than quadrupled in a decade to 133. The oval-ball game was seen as a noble sport with British values.

This trend caused Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski to argue in their book Why England Lose that ‘only when there are England players with educated accents might the national team maximise its potential.’

The latest chance of many to prove that verdict wrong comes at the European Championship in July, 2016 — the 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme.

Many sportsman, not just footballers, fought for their country in France and Belgium

Many failed to appreciate the lengths these sportsman took to show their respect and pride for their country
