A rich husband is less likely to help you with the housework than one on a lower income.

This is according to a new study which claims to have found a link between a man's wealth and attitudes towards gender equality.

The research also found that women are still doing the most around the home, no matter how many hours they work or how much they are paid.

A rich husband is less likely to help you with the housework than one on a lower income. This is according to a new study which claims to have found a link between a man's wealth and attitudes towards gender equality

'It seems men on lower incomes are happily picking up the dusters, filling the dishwasher and generally starting to do their bit,' said Dr Clare Lyonette from Warwick University.

But there is a different attitude when it comes to higher earners – and women could be partly to blame, the researchers say.

'We found that while men in these households do also recognise the need to help their partners, they remain reluctant to lift a finger and appear to simply throw money at the issue by hiring a cleaner instead,' said Dr Lyonette. 

The researchers interviewed 36 partnered women and 12 partnered men for the project, all of whom had at least one child under the age of 14.

'Inequality still exists and that's perpetuated, in part, by the so-called 'myth of male incompetence',' added Dr Lyonette.

'This is a belief by some women - and our study shows it's still rife - that men are unable to complete housework to an acceptable standard.'

One participant in the survey told the researcher: 'I think they do it on purpose, men, don't they?

'Using the cleaner, he'll just clean around things, then all of a sudden you'll move the sofa and you're like, "what is that under there?"... or he says: "Don't clean upstairs now because no one goes up there bar us, you don't need to hoover' is his argument".'

Dr Lyonette concluded that men from lower-income families seem to be starting to do their bit around the home.

'But until all men are willing to take on more domestic tasks, so allowing women to take on greater responsibility within the workplace, any hoped-for progress in gender equality is likely to stall,' she added.

You may imagine that a man who is adept at housework would be attractive to woman. But sociologists claim that mopping the kitchen and washing up dishes won’t help men get lucky in the bedroom - with middle-aged women at least.

A study has found that men who regularly do housework, such as cooking and cleaning, have less sex than men who don’t bother.

Researchers from the Juan March Institute in Madrid studied data based on relationships of 4,561 middle-aged US couples over 20 years, including their sex lives and how they divide household chores.

The study found that home tasks such as cooking and cleaning are traditionally perceived as women’s work – and 80 per cent of housework is still done by females.

The results showed that men performed around 55 per cent of 'masculine' tasks such as paying bills and mowing the lawn. While egalitarian marriages tended to be happier, men who did ‘feminine’ tasks had sex less often than those who shunned the iron and oven.
