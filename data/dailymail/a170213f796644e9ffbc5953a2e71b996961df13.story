Seven decades of separation has seen even the language of North and South Korea split into two different dialects.

The two countries, though enemies, are tied together by history, by family and by language - but only to a point. 

South Koreans have incorporated many English words and phrases into their language while isolated communist North Korea has eliminated words with foreign origins and created homegrown substitutes. 

North Korean defector Pak Mi-ok ended up going without water during a meal in the South because she was too shy to admit she didn't understand the term 'self-service'

For those south of the divide, English-based words like 'shampoo,' 'juice' and 'self-service' are common.

But they mean absolutely nothing to defectors from the insular North Korea. 

When Pak Mi-ok first arrived in South Korea after her defection in 2002, she was told by a waitress at a restaurant that water was 'self-service,' an English phrase she had not heard before. 

She ended up going without water during her meal because she was too shy to admit she didn't understand.

'I worried the waitress would look down on me,' she told the Associated Press.

She started out working at restaurants but struggled to understand customers. 'I thought they spoke a different language,' she said.

But she gradually picked up the new vocabulary and uses words like 'stress' and 'claim' that are not heard up in the North.

Similarly, people in Seoul are confused by homegrown North Korean words like 'salgyeolmul,' which literally translates to 'skin water' - but is just 'lotion' in the South.

The Korean Peninsula's 70-year split has created a widening linguistic divide that produces misunderstandings, hurt feelings and sometimes even laughter.

The North's isolation near-worship of the ruling Kim family (pictured centre, leader Kim Jong-un) has also skewed the language

The gap has grown so wide that about a third of everyday words used in the two countries are different, according to scholars.

North and South Koreans are generally able to understand each other given that the majority of words and grammar are still the same

But the differences show how language can change when one half of the country becomes an international economic powerhouse and the other isolates itself, suspicious of outside influences.

The huge cultural influence of America through its military presence, business ties and Hollywood has flooded the South Korean vernacular with words borrowed from English. 

'Konglish' uses English words in non-standard ways, like 'handle' for steering wheel, 'hand phone' for cellphone and 'manicure' for nail polish.

In North Korea's view, this is just further evidence that the South is an American cultural colony. 

The North's isolation and near-worship of the ruling Kim family has also skewed the language. 

South Koreans use the English loan word 'juice' but North Koreans say 'danmul,' or 'sweet water.'

South Koreans watch a 'musical' but North Koreans see a 'gamuiyagi,' or 'music and dance story.'

'Suryong' is the revered title for North's founding leader and his son, but in the South it's a historical term referring to a medieval regional or faction leader.

The sea creatures that South Koreans call 'cuttlefish' are known in North Korea by the word South Koreans use for 'octopus.'

The term 'elderly person' is considered neutral in the North, but pejorative in the South.

South Koreans wash their hair with 'shampoo' but North Koreans use 'meorimulbinu,' or 'hair water soap.'

The word 'dongmu' is used in North Korea to refer to a revolutionary colleague, but South Koreans seldom use the term.

A 'dosirak' is South Korean word for a lunch box while North Koreans call it 'gwakbab.'

South Koreans use the English loan phrase 'skin lotion' but it's 'salgyeolmul,' or 'skin water' in the North.

North and South Korea have different spelling and pronunciation rules for the first syllable of some Korean words, so the common family name is 'Lee' in the South but 'Ri' in the North.

South Koreans often end their conversations with phrases like 'Let's have lunch someday' or 'Let's go out for drinks soon,' but North Korean defectors who have just arrived often take those as literal invitations and expect a follow-up phone call to arrange the appointment.

'Suryong' is the revered title for the North's founding leader and his son, Kim Jong Il, the father of the current ruler, Kim Jong Un. But in the South it's used to refer to a faction or local leader from centuries ago. 

Misunderstandings can arise to seemingly innocuous Korean phrases like, 'Let's do lunch sometime,' which those in the South frequently use as a friendly ending to conversations, even with casual acquaintances. 

But newly arrived North Korean defectors take such invitations literally, and are often dismayed or offended when they don't get a follow-up phone call.

'If someone uses such empty words in North Korea, they'll see their relations with others cut off and be branded as a faithless person,' said a defector who asked not to be identified because of worries that doing so would put family members in the North at risk.

Linguists say it takes about two years for North Korean defectors to feel comfortable conversing in South Korea. 

Over the past 10 years, there have been efforts to produce a joint dictionary containing 330,000 words from both countries - a rare example of co-operation.

But as is often the case, political tensions have interfered with progress. The meetings only resumed last July after a more than four-year hiatus following the 2010 sinking of a South Korean warship. 

A new round of meetings, tentatively set for last month, hasn't been held as North Korea bristled over the annual springtime joint U.S.-South Korea military drills.

Even language experts from the two countries can have trouble understanding each other.

During last year's meeting in Pyongyang, South Korean linguist Kim Byungmoon said he tried to explain how South Koreans use the English word 'glamour' as a noun to refer to a voluptuous woman, but North Korean scholars had difficulty understanding its usage.
