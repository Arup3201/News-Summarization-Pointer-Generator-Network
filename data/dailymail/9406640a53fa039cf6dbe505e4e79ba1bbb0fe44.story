Thousand of British wine connoisseurs have unwittingly been drinking vintage burgundy topped up with cheap table wine under a scam operated by one of France’s most prestigious traders, prosecutors have claimed.

Following an 18-month investigation, police say that merchants Labouré-Roi took bottles of Nuits St George and topped them up with supermarket wines.

Nuits St George was not part of the scam which happened between 2005 and 2009 when 2million bottles were sold, police said at a press conference in Dijon.

They were bought by people who thought they were buying Nuits St George vintages that were chateau-produced and, in some cases, prize-winning.

Labouré-Roi,
 which has been established since 1832, is the Burgundy region's third 
biggest wine company and sells the drink across the world.

Some
 of the bottles were also individually numbered wines and the scam is 
believed to have earned several hundred million pounds.

Some
 of the cases of wines were being sold for thousands of pounds despite 
them being topped up with a cheaper wine from the south of France with 
high alcohol content and available from supermarkets, the police said.

Two of Labouré-Roi's
 executives, brothers Armand, 82, and Louis Cottin, 83,were arrested 
last week in a police sting along with a wine taster and the company 
administrator.

They were later released and are yet to be charged.

Gendarmes
 have seized significant amounts of wine and tax inspectors are also 
looking into the company's records, a police spokesman said.

Revelations about the Nuits St George scam come only a few weeks after it emerged in March this year that another wine company at Beaune in Burgundy allegedly cheated its customers with diluted AOS Bourgogne label wine.

But the scale of the Labouré-Roi scam is likely to inflict far greater damage to the worldwide reputation of Burgundy wine.

Labouré-Roi is a world-renowned name in wines which exports to 30 countries including Britain and the U.S., gleaning more than 50 per cent of its turnover from international trade.

Armand Cottin, one of Labouré-Roi's directors said: 'We are three years after the period which was checked by investigators and we are now approaching a situation where we have an error rate of close to zero.

'The management is taking responsibility for the situation we are in.'

A lawyer for the company said that none of the directors have been charged and the company had moved on from the period in question.

The lawyer said that the main concern of the two directors who are in their eighties and are finding the present situation 'difficult to cope with' is to save the jobs of the company's 70 employees.
