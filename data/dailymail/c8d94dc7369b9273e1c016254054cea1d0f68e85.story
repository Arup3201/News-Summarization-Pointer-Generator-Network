A photograph widely circulating on social media last night purported to show a Russian separatist fighter stealing a ring from a victim of the MH17 crash.

In the picture, which has not been independently verified, three rebels wearing military uniforms appear to be rifling through the wreckage.

A blonde-haired fighter, wearing a black beret, is bent over what looks like wreckage and apparently holding what seems to be a gold ring.

Hunt for clues? A rebel fighter is filmed rifling through the bag of one of the 298 MH17 crash victims

The suggestion is that it could have been found amid a victim’s belongings or even taken from a body.

The image, which appears to have been first tweeted in Russian by the user ‘stabilizec’, was shared thousands of times on Twitter. 

There was a furious backlash online with many users voicing their distaste at the picture despite any confirmation of what it showed.

Sean Callaghan from Cheshire called it ‘an appalling act of inhumanity’.

Others, however, said rebels may have been looking for an inscription to identify a body.

The image came as a video given to the BBC showed other pro-Russia fighters emptying out the luggage of victims of the tragedy.

The
 footage, which the rebels gave to the BBC, provides fresh evidence that
 they took away material that could have proved crucial for crash 
investigators.

It was not immediately known what the Malaysian team would do with the black boxes, but there was speculation they would pass the boxes on to experts with experience of reading the data

The militia leader who shot the film, named only as ‘Zhuk’, tried to justify his men’s actions.

‘We looked at their belongings because we were searching for documents. Then we put them in a truck and took them away for sorting,’ he told the BBC.

The controversy comes after leaders blasted pro-Russian rebels working on the site for 'manhandling' the bodies.

Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans told Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko that his country was 'angry' and 'furious' by reports of bodies being dragged around the site in Grabovo, Donetsk.

'We are already shocked by the news we got today of bodies being dragged around, of the site not being treated properly,' he said.

Ukrainian officials accused pro-Russian separatists of taking bodies from the scene of the crash before emergency services personnel began officially collecting them on Saturday.

However, today Ukrainian officials announced all possible remains had been recovered.

Of the 298 victims, 282 have been moved into a refrigerated train which has finally left Torez, heading west.

Fragments from a further 16 bodies have also been recovered but are badly burned, officials explained.

The remains will be handed to the Netherlands, which, at 192, had the greatest number of fatalities. 

Meanwhile the black boxes from the Malaysia Airlines plane will be handed to Malaysian authorities.
