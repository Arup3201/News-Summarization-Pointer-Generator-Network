Move over Samuel Pepys, a new diarist has emerged on the scene whose epic work makes the great chronicler of the 17th century's look like hastily scribbled musings on a post-it note.

Weighing half-a-tonne, comprising 151 volumes, covering 21,000 pages and totaling a a four million words, John Gadd is thought to have compiled the biggest personal diary ever seen in Britain.

His tome also includes 33,000
photographs, illustrations, cuttings from newspapers and everyday items 
like wine labels and food wrappers, making it a real snapshot of one man's life.

Chronicler: John Gadd is arguably the most prolific diarist in the world, with his record of four million words charting 38 years

Easy access: Despite weighing half a tonne, Mr Gadd says he can find any given entry in only three minutes

Labour of love: His work is fully illustrated with artwork, photographs and even food packaging

The 83-year-old first began writing it in 1947 and - 
barring a two-week break every year to update the indexes - has added 
his daily exploits to his labour of love.

And each Christmas he sets aside two weeks to meticulously index that year’s diary - proudly claiming he can find anything within three minutes.

His diary is now eight times the size of War and Peace, more than four-and-a-half times bigger than the complete works of Shakespeare and close to the total output of Dickens. It is three times bigger than Samuel Pepys work, which so vividly charted the Enlightenment period.

Mr Gadd sees his work as a chronicle of life in and around the Dorset village of Fontmell Magna, where he lives with wife Barbara.

He said: 'The volumes document everything. You name it, it’s in there.

'I write about whatever has captured my imagination during the day. I am just keeping a record in case no one else does and I’m a total obsessive with it.

Review: Diary author John Gadd looks back on an entry he wrote some years ago

Fond memories: Fontmell Magna in Dorset, Dorset, which features prominently in John Gadd's diaries

Sporting: Mr Gadd writes passionately about another of his loves, Fontmell Magna Cricket Club

Nipper: Mr Gadd's diary has more than 33,000 photographs and pictures, including this one here of the man himself as a five-year-old

'It would be a shame to look back in so many years time wishing we knew what had happened, or how something had happened.

'It settles family arguments too. My wife Barbara and I are always arguing about who we met, when we met them and how old they are.

'She has a wonderful memory and I have a very bad memory, but I have my diaries - although I have to say she is nearly always right.

'A lot of people are feature in the diary over the years and they often want to see what I say about them - I’m happy to report most of it is good.

'I can’t stop now, when you’ve kept it up as long as I have you need to keep going.'

Dog lover: Mr Gadd's terriers also feature highly in the work, pictured here with one of his pets in 1988

In clover: One of the international pig consultant's greatest achievements was when he appeared on the front cover of The Pig Farmer in 1980

Jet setter: His job was to take him all the way around the world, all of which has been painstakingly documented

Mr Gadd started keeping his diary on a
whim in 1947 and filled it intermittently for many years until 1975, 
when he began keeping a detailed daily event log.

He records the minutiae of his daily routine, from the time he gets up to walking the dog and what he has eaten during the day.

Mr
Gadd describes every village fete, the walks he took with his beloved 
Yorkshire Terriers, and has amassed a vast collection of his favourite 
wine labels over the years.

Vintage: Another of Mr Gadd's loves is wine, and his diary contains many labels of bottles he has consumed

Taking the biscuit: Food wrappers, such as this Hob-nobs packet, provide a window to the past. Back then they cost just 63p

He has also recorded the daily events from his 33-year career as an international pig consultant which saw him make many trips abroad.

Mr Gadd, who has one daughter, 
Alison, has captured some of the biggest changes in history - including 
the switch from vinyl to CD.

One
extract on September 9, 1988 reads: 'The day of the LP black disc is 
coming to an end, so they have been put away while they are available.

Victory: Mr Gadd charted the street party in his village to celebrate VE day, left, and right, pages showing the Blandflord Floods of 1979-80

Happy days: Pictures of Mr Gadd when he was a boy

'In a years time they will be disappearing off the shelves and before long they will become collectors items as they clear out and the CD will take over.'

He also documents his frustrations at the first postal strike in 17 years in 1988 and his pride at appearing on the front of ‘The Pig Farmer’ magazine.

He described the birth of Fergie’s first baby on August 9, 1988: 'Fergie had her first baby last night, it will be fifth in succession to the throne.

'No name has been announced yet but the guesses are that it will be either Victoria, or Elizabeth, or both.

'J wants it to be Annabel so he can immediately call it Hannibal.

'Media have gone crazy over the birth, it’s boring me to hell.'

The diaries also include plane tickets, mementos, and photographs of the numerous places he has visited over the years.

Weighty tome: Some of the volumes stacked on shelves that have been amassed by the 83-year-old

He added: 'In past times many diarists had the time to sketch and paint to add interest to their record. In 1975 I thought I can at least take photos.

'A fortnight off is taken at Christmas every year to update two indexes - one for the text and one for the illustrations.

'After all, there is no point in squirreling away all that information in 22,000 pages if you can’t retrieve it, and I’m pleased to say any subject or illustration can be found within three minutes.

Travel: Branding and tickets from a trip he took to the continent on a Sealink ferry

Pig consultant: His job was to take him all around the world and introduced him to many different cultures

'I do it because it is fun and it is 
also useful to show the changes in our village and over Dorset over more
than three decades, and to remind you how fickle memory can be.

'Sometimes
I write just one sentence, some times I have a rush of blood to the 
head and I can write an essay or commentary or two or three thousand 
words.'

He added: 'To begin with the diary was quite hard work and pretty boring. But
after a few years I started being honest with myself and thought ‘what 
the hell am I doing this for if I can’t tell the truth?’

'It’s
amazing looking back how your opinions change over the years - and 
sometimes you don’t like what you read from 30 years ago.'

His
diary has now gone public display for the first time. Ten volumes and 
one index are on show this weekend at the Fontmell Magna Village Archive
Society’s 9th annual exhibition, held in the village hall.
