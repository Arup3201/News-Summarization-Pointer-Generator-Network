Police missed a series of chances to protect a woman from her estranged husband before he stabbed her to death at her hair salon, a damning report has found.

Former policeman Ivan Esack knifed Natalie Esack up to 11 times in front of her shocked colleague because he could not cope with her having a new boyfriend.

The blade of the eight-inch knife he used bent  under the ferocity of the savage attack at Esack Hair and Beauty in High Street, Ashford, Kent.

Following the stabbing in April 2012, Esack told her colleague: 'She deserved it, the bitch.' He was later jailed for life with a minimum term of 28 years.

His trial heard that, in the period before the killing, Esack told his victim she was a 'dead woman walking' and menacing added: 'Tick tock, tick tock.'

Now a Domestic Homicide Review (DHR) has found there were 'a number of missed opportunities' for authorities  to protect Mrs Esack.

Kent Police could have first arrested the killer in October 2011 after Mrs Esack visited a police station to report unwanted contact from him after they split up, it found.

The report said that, at the time, Esack constantly phoned her, made a threat to kill her and threatened to go to her brother's house where she was staying.

Mrs Esack also told police that Esack invited her to join in a 'threesome' with a man he had started a sexual relationship with, it stated.

But police only deemed the incident as 'medium risk' gave her 'advice on how to deal with domestic abuse', the review said.

When police later visited Esack, he apologised for sending her the texts, but claimed she had provoked him and he was not arrested.

The review said that Kent Police could also have arrested Esack for sending malicious communications or issued him with an harassment warning.

In February 2012, he turned up at the house where she was staying, carrying a knife and threatening to slit his throat.

'This should have resulted in further investigation into an offence of possession of an offensive weapon,' the report added.

The final incident reported to Kent Police before her death came in March 2012 when Esack turned up at Mrs Esack's father's house and refused to leave.

Reporting the incident, a friend also told a 999 phone operator that  Esack had, the previous day, visited Mrs Esack's workplace and throttled her until she lost consciousness.

When police attended her father's property, Mrs Esack did not want to take any action against Esack.

The officer said the control room had not passed him the information about the alleged earlier strangulation and he had not viewed his computer assisted despatch, the review noted.

The report said: 'Had all the information been collated, the... risk assessment in March 2012 should have been graded "high risk".'

The review said there was 'evidence of escalating abuse' in the six months before Mrs Esack's death and police should have investigated the incidents in March 2012 more fully.

While Mrs Esack's death may not have been prevented, the report found, domestic violence experts should have devised a 'safety plan' for her.

A series of recommendations were made in the review, including reminding officers to achieve 'a proper standard of investigation'.

The review also praised some areas of the police's work, including highlighting how officers removed Esack's shotgun and licence in November 2011.
