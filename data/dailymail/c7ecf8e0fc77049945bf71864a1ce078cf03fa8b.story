Which sporting champion has decided to resemble Star Wars hero Chewbacca?

After a year of success it appears this sportsperson has decided to find a way to go into hiding from the public eye.

However, being the force in the field that he is Lewis Hamilton has found a different approach to winning once more.

Lewis Hamilton uploaded an Instagram photo of himself in a ghillie-style suit as he went paintballing

The 29-year-old celebrated his Formula One Drivers' Championship success with constructors winners Mercedes  by going paintballing.

Accompanied with the caption: 'Out with my team paint balling today... Like my outfit?? #TeamLH #MercedesAMGPetronas #BigFoot #Chubaka #SniperLife #Yetti,' the two-time world champion can be seen in an outfit that resembles an Army ghillie suit.

The Brit had to show his attritional qualities throughout the season as he battled with Mercedes' team-mate Nico Rosberg for the world title.

The pair's tussle boiled all the way down to the season-ending race at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which Hamilton clinched with a first-placed finish as Rosberg finished 14th.

Rosberg and his competitors will be hoping Hamilton, who won 11 grand prix races in 2014, won't be showing his predatory instincts behind the wheel next season too.
