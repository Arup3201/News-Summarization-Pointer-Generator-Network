Two videos taken by passengers aboard Southwest Airlines Flight 345 reveal panic in the cabin after the nose landing gear unexpectedly collapsed as the plane touched down at New York's LaGuardia Airport on Monday.

Bryan Foster happened to be filming out the window of the Boeing 737-700 as it came in for a landing and the shock of the plane's nose hitting the runway knocked the camera out of his hand. When he regained his composure and pointed the lens out o the window again, he captured sparks flying from the wing-mounted engine as it dragged along the pavement.

New Yorker Aidan Mack captured a similarly terrifying scene from her seat aboard the plane, filled with 144 passengers and six crews members. Her video shows some passengers beginning to panic after they were shaken by the hard jolt with no warning.

Panic: Some passengers suddenly stood up after the plane came to a halt and demanded to get off the plane. Most, though, remained calm

WABC-TV reports that Ms Mack's story is even more incredible because she is deaf. She struggled to understand what was happening and fought panic - because she was unable to hear any of the announcements in the cabin.

'For me, it was just frantically trying to figure out the situation by watching the body language and the expressions of my fellow passengers, but I was really quite unique in that situation and all alone,' she told the TV station through sign language.

Ms Mack's video footage shows some panicked passengers stand and scream after the crash-landing. Most, though, remained calm. 

Mr Foster, a Louisana-native, told Pix11 that he had no warning of what was about to happen when the landing gear gave way.

'We’re just approaching, we’re just coming in for a landing. I’m just filming with my GoPro (camera), out the window. And then we hit. That was the impact. It knocked the camera out of my hand,' he said.

'So I had to gather myself. So now I’m looking around. I’m looking around the cabin now and wondering what’s going on. I put the camera back out the window, and as you can see the engine is sparking as we skidded across the tarmac.'

Southwest Airlines passenger Bryan Foster never realized he would be filming an air disaster when he held up his GoPro camera out the window as Flight 345 landed

Rattled: The jarring crash of the jetliner's nose on the tarmac left passengers shaken - along with the cameras inside the cabin

Within seconds of the plane coming to a halt, one panicked passenger can be heard trying to get off the plane.

'Open the doors! Can we open the doors?' he shouts. Another passenger tells the man to calm down.

Finally, a flight attendant addresses the passengers who have stood up on the public address system, saying 'Ladies and gentlemen, we are not there yet. You need to take your seats.'

Ten people were injured on the flight - which originated from Nashville, Tennessee. Six were taken to the hospital, though their injuries were described as minor.

Passengers stayed in the cabin for nearly an hour before they were evacuated on the plane's inflatable ramps.

Another video, obtained by NBC New York, shows the plane crash-landing at New York's La Guardia Airport at around 5.45pm on Monday as it arrived from Nashville, Tennessee with 144 passengers and six crew members on board.

Frightening: A Southwest flight crash-landed at New York's La Guardia airport Monday evening after the landing gear unexpectedly fell off the plane

Caught on tape: A grainy video of the plane skidding down the runway for 15 seconds was released Tuesday morning just as the airport fully reopened 

'There was a loud crash and the plane skidded for 10 or 15 seconds,' flyer Mary Anne Sperry said.

'The doors weren’t being opened and smoke was filling up the cabin,' she told The New York Post.

Airline officials are still trying to determine what caused that landing gear to malfunction as they said there was no advance warning of a problem.

'The aircraft skidded down the runway on its nose and then veered off and came to rest in the grass area,' said Thomas Bosco, acting director of aviation for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The airport was closed for more than an hour, delaying thousands of travelers.

Passengers ran to safety after evacuating the crippled jetliner on Monday evening

One runway reopened and was operating by 8pm, and the entire airport was fully reopened Tuesday morning.

Stranded travelers at the busy New York airport posted photos of fire engines hosing down the nose of the plane.

Officials say the landing gear came down, but then collapsed as the plane touched down.

Mr Bosco said there was no indication there was a problem with the landing gear before the pilot touched down in spite of reports that the flight was initially delayed in Nashville because of a problem relating to the tires.

'From what we know, the aircraft landed on runway 4 and the landing gear collapsed, specifically the nose landing gear,' he said.

Witnesses reported seeing sparks flying as the nose of the plane skidded to a stop on the runway.

'I heard some people gasp and scream. I looked over and saw sparks flying at the front of the plane,' Bobby Abtahi, a lawyer who was waiting for a different flight and watching out of the terminal, said of his view of the crash.

Three injuries were reported aboard the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700 jetliner, which was bound from Nashville, Tennessee

No injuries: Southwest Airlines Flight 345 crash-landed at New York City's LaGuardia Airport on Monday evening. It was forced to slide on the tarmac after its front landing gear failed to deploy

The plane was carrying 143 passengers and five crew members. Three minor injuries have been reported

Passengers
 were forced to stay in their seats and wait aboard the plane for more 
than 45 minutes before they could be evacuated.

Everyone
 was evacuated safely within an hour of the landing - sliding down the 
inflatable chutes that extended from the doorways.

It
 is unclear what caused the malfunction. The rear landing gear on the plane extended normally.

Witnesses told CNN that an emergency crew did not appear to be standing by on LaGuardia's Runway Four when the plane crash-landed.

The
 apparent mechanical failure comes just more than two weeks after Asiana
 Airlines Flight 214 crash landed at San Francisco International 
Airport, killing three Chinese students and injuring dozens.

Bobby Abtahi, a businessman from Dallas, Texas, tweeted photographs of the cripples plane from the American Airlines Admirals Club.

'Wow. Wheels just came off southwest flight at LGA,' he wrote.

Dancer Simirin Player, who was aboard the plane, posted a photo of herself safely outside the jet on Instagram.

'Just crash landed in Laguardia airport in NYC!! Thanks be to God that nobody was hurt! Scariest thing ever!!!' she said.
