The boyfriend and personal chef of the late Wall Street investor Christopher Browne are locked in a vicious legal battle over the legendary moneyman's $300 million estate.

In court papers filed this week in Manhattan, Joseph Ouellette, who worked for Browne for 18-years said that the broker's jealous partner Andrew Gordon had swindled him out of almost $4 million that was left to him by Browne in his will.

The suit alleges that Gordon, who is 14-years Browne's junior, took advantage of his boyfriend's failing health to push his favourite chef Ouellette out of a job, out of his home and leave him with nothing after the investor died of a heart attack aged 62, in 2009.

Filing his lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court, Ouellette compared Gordon to a cross between Richard Gere's character from the 'American Gigolo' and Claus von Bulow, the British socialite who was famously acquitted of killing his American heiress wife in 1980 and who was played by actor Jeremy Irons in the 1990 movie 'Reversal of Fortune'.

The suit says that Gordon, who is now 51, manipulated Browne to take every penny he could from him, even though he was going to inherit most of his estate including his $75 million East Hampton property and his $25 million Park Avenue apartment.

Classically trained chef Ouellette called architect Gordon 'a cross between the American Gigolo and Claus von Bulow' and alleged that he connived to leave him with nothing to show for 18-years of service to Browne.

The court filing says that a 1999 version of the will that Browne drew up left $4 million to his long-time personal chef who also claims that he was a confidant to the successful investor who counted billionaire Warren Buffet among his clients.

However, after Browne began dating Gordon in 2003, Ouellette claims that the former chief of value investment firm Tweedy Browne changed his will to leave his boyfriend with $100 million and reduced his chef's share to $500,000.

Court papers also show that Browne was willing to leave his chef with the East 57th Street apartment that he had bought for Ouellette and his family.

It was in 2007, that the will changed again after Browne suffered an accident and a severe head injury.

Ouelette says that his share of Browne's $300 million will was reduced to only $100,000 and a provision that he could stay in the Midtown Manhattan apartment for six-months and only if he was still employed by Browne.

But just weeks before Browne suffered a fatal heart attack in 2009, aged 62, Ouellette was fired and he and his family were ordered to leave the building - the suit alleges that he firing was 'on Mr. Gordon's say-so'.

'It’s a shame that someone so loyal was treated so poorly by someone so rich,' said Ouellette’s attorney Tom Mullaney to the New York Post.

Countering the claims made by Ouelette, Gordon said that his boyfriend was in complete control of his faculties during each will amendment and that he had not put any 'undue influence' on him to make changes.

Long known as one of the most successful investors on Wall Street, Christopher H. Browne was known for buying up stocks that were at rock bottom and waiting for their value to soar before selling.

Succeeding his father as senior partner at the firm Tweedy, Browne & Co. in 1969, Browne developed the company to the point where it managed more than $10 billion in value investments.

The multi-millionaire came to international prominence in 2001 when he raised questions about press magnate Conrad Black's company Hollinger International, which the Canadian who had a seat in the British House of Lords used illegally fund his lavish lifestyle.

At the time, Tweedy Browne had a sizeable share in Hollinger, which owned the UK's Daily Telegraph and the Chicago Sun-Times.

His guilty conviction was eventually reversed. Joseph Ouelette alleged that Andrew Gordon was 'a cross between the American Gigolo and Claus von Bulow.'

Leading a shareholder initiated revolt, investigations were begun into Black's financial history which eventually concluded in a fraud conviction and a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence.

A noted philanthropist, Browne donated $10 million to the University of Pennsylvania and funded research in HIV and AIDS at Rockefeller University in New York.

Known as a political conservative, Browne was an enthusiastic amateur architect and a lover of formal English gardens, one of which he installed in the grounds of his East Hampton home on New York's Long Island.
