An eight-year-old boy whose parents launched a successful social media campaign to get him access to experimental new medicine is doing so well he didn't need dialysis Monday, and hopefully won't need it again on Wednesday.

Josh Hardy from Fredericksburg, Virginia, who was battling cancer and an accompanying infection, is now part of a new clinical trial for the drug brincidofovir, which is being developed by Chimerix Inc.

And since his first dose on March 12, his deadly adenovirus has all but disappeared from his system.

He was able to leave St. Jude Children's Hospital in Tennessee on April 10, and continue treatment as an outpatient.

Good news: Josh Hardy from Fredericksburg, Virginia, who was battling cancer and an accompanying infection, is ditching the dialysis after a few months on the drug brincidofovir, which is being developed by Chimerix Inc.

Now he's ditched the dialysis - a big step that means Josh's kidney function is returning and the organs are clearing and filtering as they should.

Since he's been out of the hospital, his health has improved in other ways too, his mom told Fredericksburg.com.

Aimee Hardy said he no longer has tubes in his nose and can eat and drink on his own, with his favorite meal being Chick-fil-A.

His family said they're now working on building up his strength with physical therapy that will get him walking and running.

'We practice walking,' Mrs Hardy told the news website. 'We trick him into doing leg lifts by kicking a ball.'

The gravely ill little boy was given the experimental drug after his parents made their high-profile plea to the boss of Chimerix.

Josh was fighting for his life in March after contracting the infection that caused internal bleeding and heart and kidney failure.

But his family said the virus was barely detectable after just four doses of Brincidofovir.

Sick: Earlier this year, the then-7-year-old could barely speak and was vomiting blood, while his family kept a desperate vigil at his bedside

His mother Aimee, who campaigned the drug company, told ABC 11 earlier this year: 'We have gone from dire circumstances to discussing with our doctors what we need to do to get Josh discharged from the hospital.

'We are so grateful that the company was able to find a way for Josh to receive the medicine.'

Josh was moved from ICU to a regular room at St Jude Children's Hospital, in Memphis, before he was later discharged.

Earlier this year, the then-7-year-old could barely speak and was vomiting blood, while his family kept a desperate vigil at his bedside.

Josh's body, weakened by chemotherapy after he had cancer for the fourth time, was struggling to fight of the adenovirus.

The only available drugs were not working and Chimerix had refused to give the family access to the experimental medication Brincidofovir.

But, after his family launched the #savejosh campaign, Chimerix relented. The company, in return, has been allowed to use data from Josh to help its FDA application, which could bring the drug on the market earlier.

Chimerix chief Kenneth Moch announced on Tuesday, March 11, that his firm would begin a pilot trial for the drug immediately - with Josh as the programme's first patient.

Moch had faced huge criticism for denying Josh Brincidofovir to fight off an infection he developed after a bone marrow transplant.

In a statement, Moch said that after much careful consideration Chimerix would offer Josh the medicine.

'This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix's mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need - for everyone,' Moch said according to Fox News.

'Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make.

'It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of Brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.'

Josh's physical condition improved almost immediately, although at the time his mother said he appeared to have lost his motivation after months of ill health.

She told CNN his once-positive attitude appeared to have gone and he appeared exhausted. 'I haven't seen him smile lately,' she said back then.

Josh suffered severe kidney damage after being given other drugs to try to halt the virus.

This saw his require dialysis three times a week and had doctors fearing he'd need it for the rest of his life - something that haunted Mrs Hardy.

'If he could have gotten the Brincidofovir earlier, it could have been avoided. That will always bother me,' she said earlier. Her wishes may have now come true.

The drug has not been approved by the FDA, but has previously been administered to hundreds of other patients under a prior 'compassionate use' allowance.

Previously Moch said that saying yes to Josh would mean saying yes to many more patients, draining the company's resources and delaying the time it will take for the drug to progress through the formal studies required before it can be given FDA approval and help many more future patients.

However, the company received $72 million in federal funding to develop Brincidofovir.

Battler: Josh Hardy has survived four bouts of kidney cancer, heart failure and a bone marrow transplant

Before she was able to secure the drug for her son, Mrs Hardy said the situation was devastating, especially for a boy who has fought so hard to live.

'There's no good excuse for us,' she said. 'There's nothing they can say that will really keep us from asking. We're begging them to give it to us.'

Josh's doctors also contacted Chimerix requesting their patient be allowed to have the drug.

'We have gone from dire circumstances 
to discussing with our doctors what we need to do to get Josh discharged
 from the hospital. We are so grateful that the company was able to find a way for Josh to receive the medicine'

Josh was diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007. Since then, he has battled the disease four times.

He had been in remission for two years when a bone scan in November of 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder due to earlier cancer treatments.

In January of this year he had a bone marrow transplant and endured another round of chemotherapy at St Jude's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.

Following the successful surgery he developed adenovirus, an infection that can be deadly in people with weakened immune systems.

'Normally, Josh's immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,' Mrs Hardy wrote on her son's CaringBridge page.

'The challenge is his immune system can't be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance. Catch 22.'

Brincidofovir has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks, Fox and Friends has reported.
