One year on from the flash floods that devastated the town of Boulder, Colorado, a young couple are celebrating the first birthday of their daughter who was born amid the chaos.

When Ingrid Combs, the daughter of Marty and Laura Combs who was born on September 12, 2013, is older her parents plan to share with her the traumatic events of the fateful day she entered the world.

'When we tell her more about her birth story,' Laura, 28, told The Denver Post, 'we'll say we're lucky that we're alive, and lucky that she's alive.

'One of the things we'll remember is just not taking any day for granted. Anything can happen.'

The Combs home, which they had only moved into three months before, was one of hundreds in the city almost totally destroyed by the flooding which killed 10 people across the state - including four in Boulder County. 

Heavy overnight rainfall had sparked flash flooding across the state from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs, more than 100 miles south.

Boulder County - including the city of Boulder - was one of the hardest hit areas, with as much as six inches falling in just 12 hours overnight into the morning causing rock and mudslides.

Marty Combs recalls waking up at 1 a.m. to the sound of water and mud rushing into the basement of their home. By that stage, Laura was several days overdue. 

By 1:30 a.m., the Combs realized their home was in danger of collapsing and so Marty transported his nine-months-pregnant wife to a neighbors' home.

'I was just hoping and praying I didn't go into labor in the middle of the night,' recalls Laura.

She made it through the night, but then started to go into labor the next morning.

'I was in complete denial,' she said. 'I thought, "This is not the time. I'm not having a baby right now. Our house is destroyed."'

The couple was rushed to Boulder Community Health in an emergency vehicle at 10:30 a.m. and at 2:06 p.m. on Sept. 12, Ingrid was born.

'In a tragedy situation, I think she was a miracle,' said Laura. 'She's our little gift, our flood survivor.'

With his daughter safe and well, Marty made the trip back to the family's home to collect several items for the baby.

The house had been filled with more than two feet of mud and sludge, while the family's car had been buried above the wheels. 

The extensive damage required the Combs to completely redo their basement, get a new furnace and water heater, replace their buried SUV and fix their crumbled driveway.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency covered less than 10 percent of their total costs, although Servpro and several church organizations pitched in money, volunteer hours and even a few new appliances.

The basement is mud-free and recarpeted. The doors and windows have been replaced and there's even a new back patio, built with rock recovered from a nearby pile of flood debris.

'It was cool to build something out of the disaster,' said Marty, 'sort of as a reminder.'
