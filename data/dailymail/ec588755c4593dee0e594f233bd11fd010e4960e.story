Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said there was ‘no getting away’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves Muslims

Britain’s first elected Muslim Cabinet minister has said it is ‘lazy’ to claim Islam had nothing to do with last week’s terror attacks in France.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said there was ‘no getting away’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves Muslims.

Mr Javid also called on British Muslims to do more to tackle extremism – claiming they had a ‘special burden’ because so many of the attacks were carried out by fanatics who claim inspiration from Islam.

The former banker, who became the first Muslim Tory MP after being elected in 2010, attacked the ‘barbaric’ terrorists responsible for last week’s atrocities.

Mr Javid said: ‘The lazy answer from people out there is to say that this had got nothing whatsoever to do with Islam and Muslims and that should be the end of that part of the debate.

‘That is lazy and that would be wrong. You can’t get away from the fact that these people are using Islam, they are taking a great religion, a peaceful religion of a billion people around the world, taking this religion and using it as their tool to carry out their horrible activities.’

Mr Javid said because of this there was a ‘special burden’ on Muslims to deal with Islamic extremism.

He said: ‘All communities can do more to try and help and deal with terrorists, try and help track them down, but I think it is absolutely fair to say that there is a special burden on Muslim communities, because whether we like it or not, these terrorists call themselves Muslims.

‘It is no good for people to say they are not Muslims, that is what they call themselves. They do try to take what is a great peaceful religion and warp it for their own means.’

Mr Javid said that the Government's anti-terror legislation needed to be stronger.

He said: ‘Actually, ever since 9/11, and the terrible bus bombings in London, Governments has taken this issue seriously.

‘There have been a number of measures to de-radicalise and prevent radicalisation in the first place, and the question is, does it need to be tougher? I think the answer is yes.

The Culture Secretary also rejected the suggestion that Governments should step in on matters involving newspaper articles deemed to be offensive.

The former banker said: ‘Most people would accept in our country just as in any free country, we have a balance of laws that are there to protect people but also to protect their right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression. That is absolutely vital, that is something we can never let go of.

"When a newspaper decides to do, or a magazine or TV channel for that matter, it is up to them, it has got nothing to do with the Government. It never should have.

‘People can still object to something they don't like in a paper or magazine, but that doesn’t mean to say that it can’t be published. That is freedom, that is how it works.

‘There is no role for government to tell any media organisation what they should or should not publish. It is what makes us such a special society."

Mr Javid ducked a question on whether the UK threat level was likely to be raised, saying those decisions were for security professionals.

He said: ‘We remain vigilant at all times, naturally and if the threat level changes than that is a decision by the professionals.

‘What we have seen though in recent days as well is through Parliament we have had the counter terrorism bill going through, which I think is a demonstration of even while these acts were unfolding in Paris, we were debating these issues in Parliament and making sure our security forces, our police, have the tools that they need to do the job.

‘I think most people would accept that you need to make sure that the laws that you have, some that you have relied on in the past, are kept up to date, and especially in the face of modern technology.’
