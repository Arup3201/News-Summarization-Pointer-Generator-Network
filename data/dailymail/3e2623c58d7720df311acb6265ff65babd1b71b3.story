Under blazing sunshine in a tiny town in 
Upper Austria, it took just 70 seconds for the first goal of the Ronny 
Deila era to arrive. He can only hope it is an omen for the far greater 
challenges that lie ahead.

The 
quaint little Hofmaninger Stadion in Bad Wimbsbach, with a crowd of 
around 200, is a world away from the famous and imposing venues Celtic 
again hope to visit in the new season’s Champions League.

But
 it was here that Deila began his preparations for the forthcoming vital
 qualifiers and there were early signs of what he wants to see from his 
side.

Watching brief: Ronny Deila takes charge of his first match as Celtic manager

Celtic (4-2-3-1): Zaluska; Lustig, Van Dijk, Mulgrew, F Twardzik; Brown, Johansen; McGeouch, Commons, Boerrigter; Stokes.

Subs: Fasan, Matthews, O’Connell, Waters, Findlay, Kayal, McGregor, Pukki, Griffiths, Atajic, Fridjonsson, Balde, Watt

An accomplished second-minute finish from 
Anthony Stokes set the Norwegian on his way to a worthwhile victory over
 opponents who finished fifth in last season’s Russian league.

Operating
 a 4-2-3-1 system, Deila fielded an entirely different team for each 
half as he seeks to filter through his options before the first leg 
against KR Reykjavik in 11 days’ time. He watched calmly but intently 
from the sidelines throughout, frequently offering vocal encouragement 
to those now under his charge.

Deila’s
 reign as the 17th permanent manager of the Parkhead club is up and 
running. It was a landmark moment for the 38-year-old, but he kept his 
cool amid the soaring temperatures.

‘I
 didn’t feel any nerves,’ Deila insisted afterwards. ‘I was quite calm. 
Of course when the game starts you want to win. But I was okay. It was 
good to get the first victory.

‘I can also look at the game and know there are things we need to improve - and we will work on them.’

It
 didn’t take long for Deila to have a goal to celebrate. Some neat 
passing out from the back saw the ball switched wide right to Mikael 
Lustig.

He swept it forward from deep to send Stokes in behind a static Krasnodar defence. A nimble touch over the advancing goalkeeper provided an impressive finish to the first scoring move of a new management tenure.

‘It was good, I thought I don’t have to do anything,’ said Deila, breaking into a laugh. ‘It was a good goal as well, it was a good start but we gave them some chances when we lost the ball in dangerous areas. We have to work on being relaxed in those areas and in time that will come.’

With Efe Ambrose enjoying some time off following his World Cup exploits with Nigeria, Charlie Mulgrew was selected to partner Virgil van Dijk at the heart of the Celtic defence.

There were more than a few signs of rustiness on display as Krasnodar levelled after 19 minutes. Kris Commons played Mulgrew into trouble with a poor pass and the Scotland international was unable to prevent Odil Akhmedov from scampering through to beat Lukasz Zaluska.

Ricardo Laborde then sent a snip of a chance over the bar as Celtic wobbled before Zaluska was required to block out Brazilian midfielder Wanderson.

The Parkhead club were back in front before the break, though, as Stefan Johansen capitalised on a defensive mix up to calmly angle home a shot.

Deila opted to change his entire line-up at half-time amid punishing conditions, with a raft of youth players joined by the more experienced figures of Adam Matthews, Beram Kayal, Teemu Pukki and Leigh Griffiths.

It was one of the kids who extended Celtic’s lead five minutes after the restart as Callum McGregor – who enjoyed a profitable loan spell at Notts County last season - produced a fine, sidefoot finish to despatch a Matthews cross.

Krasnodar began to press more and more as the second half wore on, but Celtic goalkeeper Leo Fasan produced a clutch of impressive saves to seal a two-goal winning margin.

Next up on their four-match Austrian tour is Sunday’s visit to face old foes Rapid Vienna in the capital. Deila hopes to see a process of continual improvement as he tries to imprint his style on the squad.

‘We met a very good team tonight and the result was very good, if a little bit flattering,’ he admitted.

‘We didn’t deserve to win the match as we did but we’re allowed to have good goalkeepers, as well.

‘There were some good attacks and the young boys in the second half played very well, the attitude was good throughout the whole match.

‘We have some way to go physically - and with the play from back – but the times we got it right we got big chances.

‘There were Celtic strips in the crowd and that tells you all about the size of the club. But I was focusing on the team and I know how I want my team to perform.

‘We are at the beginning of that and I am really looking forward to getting us the way I want. When we do that, we will play some good matches because there are a lot of good players here. We need more possession but in one year you will see a different picture to what you saw here.’
