Hitler: Plundered gold after Czech invasion

The Bank of England helped the Nazis sell gold plundered from the invasion of Czechoslovakia, newly-released documents revealed yesterday.

It is feared the bullion worth  £5.6million – or £300million today – may have been used to finance Hitler’s war machine.

Archives show that the bullion, held in the Bank’s vaults, was sold to the national banks of Belgium and Holland and buyers here.

‘At the outbreak of war and for some time afterwards the Czech gold incident still rankled,’ the online documents state.

The Bank of England helped sell a further £860,000 of Nazi gold in June 1939 – without waiting for approval.

But the Government halted all transactions on the outbreak of the Second World War.

It is also believed the Bank of England still holds some ingots of the gold with a swastika stamped on them.

The sales have weighed on the reputation of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) – the central bankers’ bank which ordered the sale.

But less has been known about the Bank of England’s role under then governor Sir Montagu Norman.

The papers said: ‘The Bank of England referred the matter to the Chancellor, who said that he would like the opinion of the law officers of the Crown.

‘On the BIS enquiring, however, what was causing the delay and saying that inconvenience would be caused because of payments the next day, the Bank of England acted on the instructions referring to the law officers, who, however, subsequently upheld their action.’

The sale of gold looted by the Nazis after their invasion of Czechoslovakia has long been seen as one of the darkest episodes in central banking history. At the time, the Bank of England held the chair of the Swiss-based BIS and stored much of the gold held by other countries in its vaults.

Documents show the UK central bank felt it ought to do as the BIS instructed even as the British government attempted to freeze the sale of stolen Czech assets.

The independence of the BIS – set up in 1930 to organise German reparation payments after the First World War  – was seen as paramount particularly as the world was not yet at war.

The documents show that it was considered ‘wrong and dangerous’ for the future of BIS for the UK central bank to ‘attempt for political reasons to influence decisions of the president of the BIS’ by blocking any transactions.

But just months later, the UK government
 declared war on Germany following the Nazi invasion of Poland, and the 
position changed.

In orders to the Bank, the Chancellor said: ‘The Bank should not act upon an order of the Bank for International Settlements if it seems to the Bank to be likely that the order might benefit the enemy.’

Academics have long believed that the Bank of England, under Sir Montagu, bent over backwards to help the Nazi war machine.

In the summer of 1942 President Roosevelt sent a report on his activities to Sir Winston Churchill.

According to documents filed in Birmingham University, Churchill asked Anthony Eden, his Secretary for War, to look into the concerns.

The Bank of England still holds gold for countries all over the world – with £210billion of bullion in its coffers.

Large amounts of British Government gold are held at Fort Knox in the United States.
