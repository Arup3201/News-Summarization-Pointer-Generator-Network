American billionaire Charles Koch is involved in a secretive funding organization to undermine the science of global warming, it has been claimed.

The Donors Trust and the Donors Capital Fund, both based in Alexandria, Virginia, have been funding the climate counter-movement which seeks to cast doubt on the climate change while keeping its wealthy backers anonymous, The Independent has said.

Millions of dollars have been funneled into both funds through a third party group called the Knowledge and Progress Fund, operated by the Koch family.

Its directors include Charles Koch and his wife Liz, and it gave $4.5million
 to the Donors in the last six years, although there is no mention of the 
fund on the Koch Industries website or the Charles Koch 
Foundation website.

Ranked fourth on Forbes' list of the richest Americans, Charles, 76, is
worth an estimated $31billion and is ranked as the 45th most 
powerful person in the world.

The Kansas-based company Koch Industries, an oil, gas and chemical conglomerate he runs with his brother David, is the second largest privately held company in the country with 67,000 employees.

The opacity of the funding set up is 
attractive to wealthy backers, some of whom have interests in the fossil 
fuel industry, for it allows them to remain anonymous while supporting the 
climate counter-movement. 

Robert Brulle, a sociologist at 
Drexel University in Philadelphia, believes approximately $500m has been donated to groups dedicated to casting doubt on the science of climate change, with a large proportion of this money arriving via third party organizations.

Dr Brulle said: 'We really have 
anonymous giving and unaccountable power being exercised here in the 
creation of the climate counter-movement. There is no attribution, no 
responsibility for the actions of these foundations to the public.

A privately-funded organization set up by David Koch called Americans 
for Prosperity famously claimed that the 'Climategate' emails hacked from 
scientists at the University of East Anglia in 2009 proved not only were
 they massaging evidence of man-made climate change but that global 
warming was 'the biggest hoax the world has 
ever seen'.

worth an estimated $31billion and are jointly ranked as the 45th most 
powerful people in the world. They run Koch Industries, an oil, gas and chemical conglomerate

The trust has also donated money to the 
American Enterprise Institute which is being sued for 
defamation by climatologist Professor Michael Mann of Pennsylvania University.

He claims he was accused of 
scientific fraud and compared to a convicted child molester by the institute.

The Koch brothers hit the headlines last year during the Presidential campaign when thousands of employees at their companies 
were emailed a letter telling them to vote for Mitt Romney while warning of 
the dangers of an Obama re-election

Charles, 76, and David, 72, are both worth an estimated $31billion and are jointly ranked as the 45th most powerful people in the world.Known for their political connections to Republican groups that support lightened regulation and free markets, Charles is thought to donate more than $40million per year to his libertarian foundation.While many political analysts have understood their power for years, the pair made their biggest foray on the public stage when they helped to found the political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity, which played a significant role in the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in 2010 and the surge of the Tea Party movement.They have focused their attention to specific political campaigns in the past and had successful results. The clearest of those successes was the gubernatorial campaign of union-busting Governor Scott Walker in Wisconsin.Though the pair are famous for the secretive way in which they do business, their name has become something of a stereotype when it comes to labeling the questionable connections between private enterprise and public works.'The Koch brothers are the poster children of the effort by multinational corporate America to try to redefine the rights and values of American citizens,' Democratic Wisconsin Representative Gwen Moore told The New York Times.Hollywood took notice of the Koch’s public perception, and a shady pair of billionaire brothers (the ‘Motch brothers’) were made the villains in The Campaign, a comedy starring Zach Galifianakis and Will Ferrell.
