A University of Louisville basketball
player valiantly spurred on teammates after suffering a gruesome leg 
fracture that left the bone in his right leg protruding in front of millions of horrified TV viewers.

Kevin Ware, 20, said 'don't worry about me, win this thing' after he landed badly from a jump to block a three-point shot during the Louisville-Duke game on Sunday night.

Teammates and Coach Rick Pitino were in tears and some vomited as Ware screamed with pain and writhed on the court.

An official told several reporters that a
bone snapped. Trainers immediately covered the leg with a towel and 
placed Ware on a backboard, then lifted him onto a stretcher.

Ware's teammates responded to the 
shock of his loss by returning to the court with a vengeance. The second
half of the game saw Louisville dominate Duke - clobbering the Blue 
Devils 85-63.

Ware had successful surgery on his broken right leg on Sunday night.

School officials said doctors reset the bone and inserted a rod into the tibia during the two-hour procedure.

A few hours later, his coach showed up at the hospital with a gift: The regional championship trophy.

'He was groggy, in good spirits,' said Rick Pitino.

He added: 'He saw us win the trophy and was 
crying and said it was all worthwhile. We didn't cut down the net, but I left him the 
trophy.'

Pitino said he and his son Richard, 
who recruited Ware, and an equipment manager would spend the night in 
Indy, along with the team's doctors.

School officials said doctors reset the bone and inserted a rod into the tibia during the two-hour procedure.

Louisville will play Wichita State in
the Final Four next weekend. The winner of that game plays for the NCAA
men's basketball championship.

His teammates held up a jersey with Ware's name as they celebrated their resounding victory.

After the game, Pitino
said: 'The bone’s 6 inches out of his leg and all he’s yelling is, "Win the game, win the game"

'I've not seen that in my life. … Pretty special young man.

He told NBC: 'We won this for him. We were all choked up with emotion for him.
We’ll get him back to normal. We’ve got great doctors, great trainers. 
We talked about it every timeout, "Get Kevin home."'

Silence fell over Lucas Oil Stadium 
in Indianapolis, Indiana, where the Elite Eight game was being played, 
as horrified fans waited for news of Ware's condition.

The injury occurred with 6:33 left in
the first half as Duke's Tyler Thornton made a 3-pointer to get the 
Blue Devils within 21-20.

Ware tried to contest the shot and his leg 
buckled when he landed, bending gruesomely. 

The injury happened in front of the Louisville bench, and the Cardinals were overcome with emotion.

Six inches of Ware's leg bone was left protruding after the injury and players including Russ Smith collapsed to the floor and were clearly crying as doctors attended to Ware.

As
Ware was being loaded onto a stretcher, the Cardinals gathered at 
midcourt until Pitino called them over, saying that Ware 
wanted to talk to them before he left.

Pitino wiped away his eyes as Ware was wheeled out, as did several of the Louisville players.

Backing: After tweeting his support, legendary NFL quarterback texted Kevin Ware to offer 'anything he needed'

An outpouring of support has emerged for the injured Louisville guard, including from fellow athletes and celebrities.

Kevin Ware's break of the right tibia will go down in history as one of the most grisly sports injuries, but doctors agree that he will most likely be able to continue playing.

Ware underwent successful surgery last night at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis.

In a two hour-procedure, doctors reset the broken bone and sewed up the wound from which the tibia had protruded.

Fred Hina, Louisville's director of sports medicine, told USA Today that Ware's road to recovery will be a long one, but he should be able to play the game again.

Dr Reed Estes, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said basketball players are prone to stress fractures in the tibia, the larger of the two leg bones, and that can weaken them.

'If these are not detected they can result in a full fracture, particularly if the landing mechanics are just right' after a jump, he said.

Ware should be fine to play next season, he said.

Dr Frederick Azar, head of the Campbell Clinic in Memphis, Tennessee, and a spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, said Ware 'jumped pretty far horizontally and vertically, and he landed with a twist,' which puts so much torsion and stress on the bones they could have just snapped.

He agreed with Estes' assessment that a stress fracture could have made Ware more prone to the injury.

Former
Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann, who famously sustained a
broken leg during a Monday Night Football game against the New York 
Giants, tweeted, 'Watching Duke/ Louisville my heart goes out to Kevin 
Ware.'

If anyone knows what
Ware is going through, it's Theismann, whose career was finished when 
he was brought down by Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor, and his knee 
drove into his lower leg bones.

Theismann told NFL AM that he had texted Ware to offer 'anything he needed.'

He said: 'The emotional part of it is
where I can maybe help walk him through it because I can tell him 
everything that he's going to feel, I can tell him everything that he's 
going to go through emotionally.'

Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III, who's recovering from a knee injury he suffered in the NFL playoffs in January, tweeted: 'Prayers up for Kevin Ware, his teammates, & family.'

Today show anchor Matt Lauer posted: 'Sounds like Kevin Ware's surgery went well. My thoughts are with him this morning. So hard to see something like that!'

'Worst thing I've ever seen on a basketball court,' tweeted Yahoo basketball analyst Pat Forde.

Ware,
a native of the Bronx, New York, is a sophomore who has become a 
force on the number-one-ranked Cardinals team during the NCAA 
Tournament.

Now his 
teammates and coaches are waiting to find out when the sophomore will 
return to campus Tuesday and whether he can travel with them later this 
week to the Final Four in Atlanta.
