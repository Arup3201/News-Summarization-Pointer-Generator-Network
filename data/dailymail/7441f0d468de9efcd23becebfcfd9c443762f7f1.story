The FBI has appealed for the public's help in tracking down a dangerous child predator caught on video sexually abusing a young boy.

The man, known only as John Doe 28, was discovered in a downloaded video in November 2012 by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC).

The two agencies are so desperate to locate the man and rescue the exploited child that they have released three images of the pedophile to the general public in the hope of generating leads.

Identification: The FBI want to find this man who has been captured abusing a young boy (barely visible in the blue) on a video found in another pedophiles home  - appealing to the public for their help

'Subjects who show their faces in child pornography are not typical,' said Special Agent Karen Jurden.

'It is our hope that someone will recognize this individual and come forward. We were able to recover a very clear image of John Doe 28.'

Identifying marks: The FBI have asked if people can place this burgundy t-shirt with a fish logo on it

The NCMEC and the FBI's Violent Crimes Against Children program have enhanced screen grabs from the sickening film to help provide any clues that may lead to his identification.

Authorities hope details such as the picture hanging on the wall behind the man along with the blue chair in the images may jog someones memory.

Also, John Doe 28 wears wire-framed glasses and a burgundy t-shirt with a fish on it that a member of the public might recognize.

They have urges anyone who has any information to immediately contact the FBI.

Unfortunately, so far, the FBI and NCMEC have not been able to identify the man, or even the state, town or area - but they believe he is American, because he speaks one word during the video, 'careful'.

'Sometimes we will get some type of identifier that narrows down the geographic region,' said Jurden, who has been working on these types of cases for four years, 'but that didn’t happen in this case. That’s why we are asking for the public’s help nationwide.'

The two minute video was found during the arrest of a San Francisco man on child pornography charges.

'The video was part of his collection,' Jurden added, explaining that sexually explicit videos and images of children are often traded anonymously online.

The rush to find this man ar part of the FBI’s Operation Rescue Me and Endangered Child Alert Program (ECAP) initiatives and represent a longstanding partnership with NCMEC.

Since the inception of ECAP in 2004, 28 John Does have been investigated; 20 of these cases have been successfully resolved so far.

'We need to identify John Doe 28,' Jurden said, 'so we can make sure no harm comes to that little boy.'
