Eight-year-old Gabe White has long supported his big brother's football team - so in the last game of the season, they decided to show their appreciation.

The freshman team at Rhinelander High School in Wisconsin called the youngster, who has Down syndrome, out on the field for the last play on Thursday and handed him the ball.

A video captured by a fan in the stands shows the moment he slowly figured out what was going on - before out-running his opponents and scoring an incredible touchdown.

The touching moment was thought up by coach Mark Apfel.

No stopping him: A player from rival team Mosinee leaps towards the boy but he keeps on running

'Just have him on the sidelines, he makes everybody happier,' team coach Mark Apfel told WAOW. 'So that made me think I wanted to do something special with him.'

After the final play in their losing game against Mosinee, the team headed back out on the field and called Gabe on.

The other team kicked the ball off and Gabe's big brother Owen White intercepted it - before knocking it down towards the boy.

He scrambled to pick it up and, with a few helpful nudges from his brother, he took off, dodging his opponents, who made a convincing show of diving towards him and tumbling to the ground.

Winner: He reaches the endzone and throws up his hands in celebration as his teammates celebrate

Fan: The team lift up Gabe after he scores the touchdown at Rhinelander High School on Thursday night

After he scored, he threw up his hands in celebration and the rest of his team ran towards him before hoisting him into the air.

'When he got in the endzone, we just went and picked him up and started chanting "Gabe",' said Owen White. 'It was special.'

And the pint-sized football fan hasn't stopped talking about it since.

'I ran a touchdown and made a score!' Gabe told WAOW.

Excited: Gabe has long supported his big brother's team and calls himself their honorary manager

Thankful: The team's coach, Mark Apfel (left) came up with the idea to give Gabe a special experience, while Gabe's big brother Owen (right), who plays on the team, was also in on the secret

The team said it was their way of showing Gabe, who calls himself their 'manager', just how much they appreciate him. 

Gabe's older brother said that when the team is losing 'and it's kind of a rough game, he'll go up to a player, give him a hug, just changes your mood'.

Apfel added: 'I hope [he] will remember this for the rest of his life because it was a special moment for us.'
