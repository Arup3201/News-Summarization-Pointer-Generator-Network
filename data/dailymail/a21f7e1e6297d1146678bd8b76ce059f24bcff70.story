Malaga are interested in Everton striker Steven Naismith.

The Scotland international has arguably been Everton's best player this season and his tireless displays in the Europa League have caught the eye of Malaga staff.

However, Naismith is well thought of at Everton and the Spanish side do not have much money to spend.
