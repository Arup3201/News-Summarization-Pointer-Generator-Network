Earning: Sir Ian Kennedy, Chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, earned almost the same as a backbencher's salary for an estimated three days a week

The civil servants who run the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority are even better paid than MPs.

Three are on more than the backbench salary of £66,396, while ebullient chairman Professor Sir Ian Kennedy earned almost the same for an estimated three days a week.

IPSA agreed to pay an interim chief executive £650 a day for just 50 days’ work last year – the equivalent of an annual salary of £169,000.

The figures may at least partly explain why the panel is so willing to offer MPs such a huge rise at a time of austerity.

Chief executive Andrew McDonald took home £108,600 last year, which IPSA’s annual report admits is more than three and a half times the average salary in the UK.

On top of this, he is sitting on a generous pension pot worth £669,000 that will enable him to retire on at least £40,000 a year, with a lump sum of around £120,000.

The civil servant, who is on secondment from the Ministry of Justice, is also eligible for consideration for a bonus, although he was not paid one last year.

Philip Lloyd, the recently appointed finance and corporate services director, is on a similarly generous salary of between £105,000 and £110,000, according to the annual report.

And John Sills, director of policy and communications, earns between £85,000 and £90,000. His pension pot adds up to £435,000.

Sir Ian Kennedy was paid between £60,000 and £65,000 last year, down from the £85-90,000 he received the year before, indicating he worked fewer days in the last financial year, thought to be around three a week.

Sir Ian previously chaired the Healthcare Commission and oversaw an inquiry into children’s heart surgery at Bristol Royal Infirmary, where 29 children died between 1994 and 1995.

Crackdown: Danny Alexander has spoken out about ways in which civil servants get paid on top of their wage

When Mr McDonald had to take time off for cancer treatment between July and November last year, he was replaced as acting chief executive by Paula Higson, who earned between £30,000 and £35,000 for 50 days’ work.

This was understood to be worth around £650 a day and was the equivalent of an annual salary of £169,000. Controversially, she was paid in an ‘off-payroll’ deal, meaning she earned the money not through a normal salary, but through her private limited company.

Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has demanded a crackdown on such schemes, which allow some people to save  thousands of pounds in national insurance and income tax.
