A woman believed to be the world's longest-serving nun who spent 86 years living in a monastery has died in Spain aged 105.

Sister Teresita Barajuen died last night according to Sister Maria Romero, abbess of the Buenafuente del Sistal monastery outside Madrid.

She entered the Cistercian monastery when she was 19, according to the abbess.

Sister Teresita acknowledged in interviews that like many young women at the time, she never intended being a nun but entered the monastery because of family pressure.

In 2011 she left the monastery for the first time in 40 years to meet now-retired Benedict XVI during a papal visit to Madrid.

She entered the monastery on the same day he was born.

The Order of Cistercians is a Roman Catholic religious order of enclose monks and nuns.

They are sometimes also called the Bernardines or the White Monks, in reference to the colour of the habit over which a black scapular is worn.

The emphasis of Cistercian life is on manual labour and self-sufficiency. Many abbeys have traditionally supported themselves through activities such as agriculture and brewing ales.

The term Cistercian is the Latin name for the village of Cîteaux, near Dijon in eastern France.

It was in this village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme founded Cîteaux Abbey in 1098, with the goal of following more closely the Rule of Saint Benedict.

There has also always been a large number of Cistercian nuns; the first community was founded in the Diocese of Langres in 1125.
