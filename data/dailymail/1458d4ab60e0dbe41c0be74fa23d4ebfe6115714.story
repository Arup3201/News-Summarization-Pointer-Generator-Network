Well, this wasn’t too bad for starters. It’s doubtful many Norwich City supporters would have known who Alex Neil was this time last week.

Although elevating Hamilton Academical into the Scottish Premiership top three months after winning promotion is an unquestionable achievement, it’s still not something that really registers south of the border.

But a few minutes before 5pm on Saturday afternoon, fans of the Canaries were more than happy to sing his name with gusto after a quite remarkable victory marked the start of his Carrow Road reign.

It had been an extraordinary week for the 33-year-old. It was midweek when he emerged as the fancied name to replace Neil Adams, but he was still in Scotland on Thursday as Hamilton and Norwich thrashed out the finer points of his move.

Once a one-year rolling contract was signed, Neil dashed south, with just enough time to pose with a ‘Yellow Army’ scarf at the club’s training ground and introduce himself to the fans and the media.

From there, it was straight to Bournemouth, more miles on the road. He briefed his new squad on Friday night, putting the final touches to the plans drawn up by caretaker boss Mike Phelan and first-team coach Gary Holt to bring down the league leaders.

Neil must have been frazzled by the time he took his seat at the Goldsands Stadium, ostensibly for a watching brief.

Derby County ended Ipswich’s 11-match unbeaten league run to leapfrog them and move into second place in the Championship.

 In the latest dramatic twist in the promotion race, Chris Martin settled the Portman Road contest in the 57th minute. 

‘This is a tough place to come but we put in a really mature display,’ said Rams boss Steve McClaren. 

But when, on 64 minutes, Jonny Howson was shown a straight red card for an ill-advised tackle on Yann Kermorgant and Norwich faced a tense last half-hour against the Championship’s best attack, it was time to clear his head, walk down to the dug-out and take total command.

It clearly had the desired effect. Fifteen minutes later, Cameron Jerome picked the ball up 25 yards from goal and, with no other thought, nudged it right and curled an unstoppable shot into the top corner to leave Bournemouth’s 14-match unbeaten league run in tatters.

After that whirlwind welcome to English football, the work is only just beginning for Norwich’s new boss.

‘I thought I was better suited to lend my support at the side of the pitch to the players rather than sitting in the stands,’ Neil said. ‘Thankfully for me, we managed to get a goal and go on to win the game. It was a perfect start.

‘The one thing we really want to try and do is rally everyone. It’s important the fans and everyone at the club gives me their complete backing because all it’s going to do is benefit Norwich if we’re going to be successful.’

So far, so good. What was most impressive about Norwich’s win was that it was fully merited. Few teams come to Bournemouth and take them on at their own game. The Canaries were slick in their passing and dangerous on the break, notably when Nathan Redmond was in possession. When Howson was dismissed, a grittier side emerged that greatly impressed the Scotsman.

There will be no rest for Neil. Aside from the need to relocate urgently to Norfolk, he will need to stamp his authority on players who, in many cases, are not much younger than him.

He takes a ‘firm but fair’ approach to management and admits he isn’t afraid to give those not pulling their weight a kick up the backside.

Though Norwich, who moved within a point of the play-offs with this win, have arguably the league’s best squad, Neil is likely to strengthen by poaching Tony Andreu, the 26-year-old Frenchman who is leading scorer in Scotland, from his old club.

But Neil can set about this massive in-tray in a very positive frame of mind following this excellent start. 

WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE...

This has no place in football: a group of gay Charlton fans were duped into meeting what they believed was a similar group before their match with Brighton, only to then be attacked. Thankfully, the Charlton Rainbows group later tweeted that their members were fine.

MK Dons boss Karl Robinson claimed midfielder Carl Baker had a cup of tea thrown over his head by a Crawley fan during the 2-2 draw.

Joel Lynch produced a goal of the season contender in Huddersfield’s 3-1 win over Watford, scoring with a stylish bicycle-kick on his 200th league appearance. Not bad for a defender.
