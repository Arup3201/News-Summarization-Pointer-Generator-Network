Lynsey Sharp is determined to be a part of a new golden age of British athletics after targeting medal success at the World Championships and Olympics over the next two years.

The 24-year-old Scot won 800 metres silver at the European Championships in Zurich, just missing out on defending her title from Helsinki two years ago despite setting a personal best and a new Scottish record.

The Euros were a huge success for the British contingent, with the team finishing top of the medals table with 12 golds, five silver and six bronze.

Sharp, who also won Commonwealth Games silver at Glasgow 2014, is now determined to build on that and has set her sights on podium finishes at the next two major events in the athletics calendar.

The Loughbrough-based athlete has also targeted Dame Kelly Holmes’ British record.

‘Now that the Commonwealth Games and Europeans are out the way, the World Championships (in 2015) and the 2016 Olympics come into focus,’ said Sharp, who will be helping Radio 1 DJ Greg James prepare for the Bupa Great North Run next month.

‘If I can medal at all four major championships, that would be a great achievement.

‘I’d love to win a gold at the World Championships next year to add to my European gold - and then I’d like to try and medal at the Olympics in Rio. Then another target is to break the British Record. But it’s all going to take a lot of hard work.’

As part of Bupa’s Your First Step Campaign, elite athlete Lynsey Sharp put Greg James through his paces to prove that even with limited time, busy Brits can still achieve their goals. For more information about how Bupa can help you achieve your fitness goals visit www.bupa.co.uk/running
