From Kim Kardashian's vampire facials - which draws her own blood before injecting it back into her face - to Simon Cowell's beloved sheep placenta facials, there's some weird and wonderful beauty treatments on the market today.

But one grandmother's bizarre beauty secret has just gone and trumped them all.

67-year-old Stella Ralfini from London says that her key to eternal youth is semen facials.

Bizarre: Speaking in a YouTube video, 67-year-old Stella Ralfini says that her key to eternal youth is semen facials - a tip she picked up on her travels in India

'It's worth thousands and thousands, but it's free,' she explains in a YouTube video.

'All you need is a lover but if you don't have one, you know what to do. All you need to do is, every ten days or two weeks, just both have a good time, make sure he has a good time, and when your beautiful love-making session is over, you are going to scoop this amazing sperm mask up in your fingers, put it on your face, leave it for fifteen minutes and wash it off.'

She goes on: ''I know some of you are thinking "What is she saying?!" but we have to assume that your lover is a healthy clean man and eats wells.

British Stella, who describes herself as an author, life coach, couples counselor and tantric guide, explains that she learned the bizarre anti-ageing trick during her time in India, where she was studying a lovemaking method called Tantra. 

Skincare secret: She advises people to 'scoop this amazing sperm mask up in your fingers, put it on your face, leave it for fifteen minutes and wash it off'

Does it work? Stella said a lady in India swore by the technique, which had been passed down her family

Too far? Stella, an author and sex coach, describes a lover's semen as 'the freshest cell therapy available on our planet'

Writing on her website, she said: 'I came across one of the most beautiful women I'd ever seen. She told me she was in her late sixties but looked much younger. Her skin was so silky smooth and line free, I had to know her secret.

'Her secret was that she used a face mask made from her husband's sperm (apparently this beauty tip had been passed down through generations of her family and always been thought of as nothing.'

Stella describes a lover's semen as 'the freshest cell therapy available on our planet' because, she claims, it is packed with recognised proteins and minerals that are known to reduce the ageing process.

Does she swear by it too? In an on-camera interview with TMZ, actress Heather Locklear, 51, said she uses semen on her skin

And Stella isn't the only fan of the quirky beauty trick. In an on-camera interview with TMZ, actress Heather Locklear, 51, was asked if she had any recommendations for anti-ageing skincare products.

'You just put semen on your face,' she replied.

According to NY magazine, human sperm is a powerful anti-oxidant that is said to diminish wrinkles and smooth the skin.

The substance is now even sold by a Norwegian company called Bioforskning and spermine facials are offered in New York.

Cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Oscar Hevia told HollywoodLife.com that there's some truth in this bizarre beauty tip.

'Semen contains proteolytic enzymes, which are designed to break down proteins. In theory, if applied to the skin, these enzymes could help to break down the uneven and thickened dead layer of older, sun-damaged skin. This could make the skin feel smoother.

'However, this might only be achieved with daily application for days or weeks. It would also not be practical as a “mask,” since it is a body fluid and will not remain stable outside the body. It would lose its beneficial effect, if any, very quickly after application.'
