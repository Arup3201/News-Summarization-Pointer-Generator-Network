There were violent clashes on the streets of Newcastle today as hundreds of demonstrators from controversial anti-Islam group Pegida were met by a 2,000-strong counter-protest.

Around 400 people from the far-right group were shouted down by the counter-demonstration, with scuffles breaking out as the rally made its way through the city centre, leading to five arrests.

The rival demonstrations against the anti-Islam march were led by Respect MP George Galloway who spoke at the pro-Islam rally, branding the far-right protesters a 'German Nazi group'.

Organisers from Pegida insisted the rally would be entirely peaceful, but five people were arrested amid a heavy police presence in Newcastle's city centre. 

The five men, all from and the anti-Islam rally, were arrested on a range of including suspicion of assault, being drunk and disorderly and breaching the peace.

Mr Galloway, MP for Bradford West, addressed the counter-protest: 'All right-thinking people in Britain condemn the idea of a German Nazi group coming to the north east of England trying to stir up trouble.

'The vast majority of British people respect that and the people who are on here on the counter-demonstration are representing millions.

'We have enough problems in Britain without Germans coming over here and causing more. We have problems in Britain without racism and Islamophobia being further stoked.'

Mr Galloway, who travelled to the North East in his Mercedes, said he was not anti-German. 'I love Germans, I'm driving a German car, but this is one German import we don't want.' 

Police arrested five people following today's sporadic violent outbreaks. 

A 37-year-old man from Newcastle was arrested for assault, while two others, aged 43 and 54 were arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. The final two people arrested were a 17-year-old youth and a 20-year-old man from Halifax who were detained for breach of the peace.

Paul Weston, leader of the obscure far-right Liberty GP political party, told followers at the rally that Muslims would soon 'take over' Britain.

Pegida started in Dresden, in Germany, last October as far-right activists gathered weekly in the city to demonstrate against what they perceive as the Islamisation of Germany and Europe.

The protests rapidly grew in size - from hundreds to around 25,000 - and spread into Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Spain, Belgium and now Britain. 

The group has sought to distance itself from the far-right, saying in its position paper posted on Facebook that it is against 'preachers of hate, regardless of what religion' and 'radicalism, regardless of whether religiously or politically motivated'.

It has also banned any neo-Nazi symbols and slogans at its rallies, however it was mired in scandal when its leader Lutz Bachmann was pictured posing as Adolf Hitler.

He was forced to stand down as the group's leader after a furious backlash to the photograph, which he insisted was a joke. 

Pegida's leaders have singled out Muslim immigrants in their speeches, but the movement has broadened into one against immigrants from all backgrounds.

A particular target has been 'economic refugees', or asylum seekers who they say are seeking a better standard of living in Germany.  

Paul Weston, leader of the obscure far-right Liberty GP political party, told followers at the rally that Muslims would soon 'take over' Britain.

'That is exactly what they will do if we quietly do nothing,' he told the crowd. 'We have to fight back.'

Pegida - whose German acronym means Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West - peaked last month in Dresden when 25,000 people attended a rally, but its popularity faded when one of its leaders was pictured posing as Hitler.

A number of further protests in Germany were also cancelled following fears they were at risk of terrorist attacks. 

Dr Jacqui Rodgers, a university lecturer, was on the counter-demonstration which attracted a cross-section of people of different faiths. 

She said: 'I think it is really important for us to unite as a community and make it very clear to organisations that are trying to get a foothold in the UK that we will not tolerate their attitude and we won't accept their racist and fascist policies.'

But Pegida rally organiser Donna Trainor said: 'Islam is not a race, it is a religion. (The term) racist shouldn't be on the table.

'Pegida raises awareness. We want the Government to take notice and take Jihadis and Muslim extremists off the street.'

Unemployed Wendy Ellison, 46, from Durham, took her bulldogs Willow and Betty to the Pegida rally.

She said: 'It's no good sitting in the house, shouting at the telly.

'I feel our country is messed up now. It doesn't feel like Britain any more.'

Northumbria Police said both protests passed without any major problems and that the arrests were for 'isolated incidents'. 

Protesters also clashed  in Margate as an estimated 250 people rallied against Ukip.

Anti-Ukip demonstrators from Thanet Stand Up To UKIP outnumbered about 50 party supporters who were in the seaside town for the annual two-day conference.

One woman was arrested on suspicion of common assault.

A Kent Police spokeswoman said all protest groups were co-operating with police.

'There have been some very minor verbal exchanges,' she said.

'No-one has been injured and the protest has generally been conducted peacefully.

'Officers remain in the local area to reassure the public and to respond to any incidents if required.'
