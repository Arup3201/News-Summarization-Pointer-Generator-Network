This aerial view of the battle-scarred Donetsk Airport shows how it has been reduced to a crumbling ruin two years since nearly £500million was spent making it the gateway to Euro 2012.

The eery footage, which shows abandoned planes standing next to the shrapnel-covered runway, appears to have been recorded by a Ukrainian soldier with a portable drone. 

As it flies above the crater-riddled fields around the airport, the drone comes under fire from separatists. Bullets can be seen whizzing by but it is not hit.

Aerial footage shows how Donetsk Airport has become a deserted wasteland and a crucial battleground

Donetsk Airport has become a symbol of Ukraine's fight against separatists and the airport remains a scene of fierce fighting almost every day.

There has been two major battles at the airport, in late May and September, and it has been in the control of both sides at various points during the bitter conflict. 

It is located on the northern edge of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine's biggest city and is locked between the Ukrainian and separatist-controlled zones. 

Renovated only a couple of years ago, ahead of the Euro 2012 football championships co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland, the airport is estimated to have cost almost £500m. 

But now the airport that welcomed travelling football fans from across the globe has been reduced to a heap of twisted metal, and its runway is filled with burnt-out tanks and abandoned airliners.

The main terminal building and the control tower lie in ruins as a result of fighting early last month.

Today marks a year since Ukrainian protesters toppled the former pro-Kremlin regime in Kiev which resulted in President Viktor Yanukovych relinquishing power, but there is so far no end to the fighting in sight as the conflict in the east of the country drags on.

On a visit to Kiev today, US Vice President Joe Biden said Russia should respect the ceasefire.

He also said it should restore Ukrainian control over its own borders and remove 'illegal military formations, military equipment and militants'.

He was speaking after holding talks with President Petro Poroshenko.

Mr Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to carry out all of those actions, but none had taken place.

Some 4,300 people are thought to have died in eastern Ukraine's conflict since April. 

UN human rights figures have said an average of 13 people have been killed every day in eastern Ukraine since the 5 September ceasefire came into place.

Russia is regularly accused of arming separatist rebels, but its officials deny the allegations.
