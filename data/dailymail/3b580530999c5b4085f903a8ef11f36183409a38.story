The Ohio State Highway Patrol says 27-year-old Andrew Bloomfield and a female friend were killed on Sunday in northern Ohio's Wyandot County when the pick-up truck's driver lost control.

Bloomfield had married 37-year-old Ruth Driskill just hours before the crash, which happened around 4pm. She was in critical condition on Monday.

'He was just a great guy, always smiling. I'm gonna miss the silly and funny Andy. I was always his little brat of a sister, he told me. I love and miss him like crazy,' she lamented.
