Cesc Fabregas recently admitted that he never expected to play for Chelsea and always had issues with Blues captain John Terry while he was playing at Arsenal.

From Luis Figo swapping Barcelona for Real Madrid to Sol Campbell ditching Tottenham in favour of Arsenal, there have always been players prepared to move to rivals.

But some went further - vowing never to play for clubs or managers and then going back on their word. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at some of those forgetful individuals.

Samuel Eto'o (right) swore he would never play for Chelsea when he was at La Liga giants Barcelona

He also said he would never play for Jose Mourinho, but he joined him at Inter Milan in 2009

The Cameroonian striker did this twice. After Barcelona's infamous Champions League clash with Chelsea in 2006 in which the Spanish club were appalled at the condition of Stamford Bridge pitch, Eto'o said: 

'Never will I sign for a team trained by Mourinho. He wrecked things completely with his behaviour surrounding the two games between our sides.

'I insist Barca boss Frank Rijkaard is the better coach despite however many titles the Portuguese has won.'

He added he would rather 'sell groundnuts in my village than to play for a pathetic team like Chelsea'. 

In 2009 Eto'o moved to join Mourinho's Inter Milan and then in 2013 he again joined the Portuguese manager, this time at Chelsea.

Cesc Fabregas - Chelsea 

The former Arsenal midfielder recently admitted he hadn't ever expected to play for Chelsea.

He said: 'Three years ago no (I never thought I'd come to Chelsea). It just shows you how you can never tell in life, and even more so in football. We had a very intense rivalry with Mourinho. There were disagreements with him and (John) Terry too. Chelsea were always the team that I most wanted to beat.' 

And before his move to Barcelona in 2011, Cesc Fabregas said: 'If some day I leave Arsenal it will never be to sign for another English team. I'm very sure.'

But in the summer of 2014 Fabregas did move back to England. With Chelsea. 

Alan Smith said the only club he would never play for was Manchester United, he then moved there

Alan Smith was held up as Leeds United's poster boy when he made his debut aged just 18.

The academy graduate was born and raised in the city and had a full understanding of the club's rivalry with Manchester United. 

When asked in an interview if there was a team he'd never play for, he responded: 'Yeah. Man United.' 

He joined Alex Ferguson's side shortly after in 2004.  

When at Arsenal, Gael Clichy said that players only moved to Manchester City for financial reasons

But just two years later Clichy, pictured here playing against Hamburg, signed for City

Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure and Samir Nasri also joined City like Clichy did

When Manchester City were taken over, one of their first things they did was to start poaching Arsenal players, beginning with Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Adebayor.

But one player who said he would never make the move was Gael Clichy, who claimed he wasn't interested in being a mercenary. 

In 2009 he said: 'I really believe if you are a player who thinks only about money then you could end up at Manchester City.

'You have to think if you want to play for a big club and have your image or if you want to play for a good club and earn big money. When you ask someone to move for something like £300,000 a week it is just crazy.'

But just two years later Clichy had changed his tune and joined the club. 

He said: 'I'm really happy to be joining such a great club. I hope I can add to the quality we already have here because we have a fantastic squad who I believe will continue to get better. I can't wait to get started and I think anything is possible with this team.'

Roberto Mancini swore Carlos Tevez would not play for the club again after he refused to come off the bench

Tevez fell out with the club and didn't play for them from late September 2011 until March 2012 

But later that season Tevez played 10 games for the club and helped them win the Premier League title

Roberto Mancini - Carlos Tevez

In 2011, then-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini swore Carlos Tevez would not play for him or the club again after he refused to come on as a substitute against Bayern Munich.

He said: 'I have helped him for the last two years and I can't accept this from him. For me, he's finished. I cannot go on with him. If I decide these things then he's finished.

'I have helped him and now he's refused to play. At Bayern Munich, do you think this would happen? Would it happen at Milan or United? I am the manager and I make the decisions and in my opinion he can't play for me again.

'I am unhappy and I should be unhappy with this. I will speak in the next days with the chairman Khaldoon. That is normal because he is the chairman.' 

But in March that season, after Tevez had spent months playing golf in his native Argentina, Mancini brought him back into the side to face Chelsea. He played nine more times after that in the same season, scoring three goals. He then played for the club 47 times the following season.
