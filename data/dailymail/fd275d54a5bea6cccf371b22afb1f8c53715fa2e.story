Tom O'Gorman was allegedly murdered following a row over a chess match at his home in Dublin

A man allegedly murdered after a row over a chess match was stabbed dozens of times in what Irish police called a ‘horrific killing’ in an ‘almost unimaginable crime scene’.

Tom O’Gorman, a 39-year-old researcher with the Iona Institute, was badly mutilated in the attack at his home in an affluent Dublin suburb.

Police have arrested Mr O’Gorman’s Italian lodger and senior security sources said the scene was ‘like an abattoir’. It was said to be so shocking that the two officers who found the body will be sent for trauma counselling.

It is understood that the arrested man’s face and clothes were covered in blood  when officers arrived shortly before 2am yesterday. It is understood the arrested man – a 34-year-old who had been living with Mr O’Gorman for a number of months – was the person who alerted police.

Investigating officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death, which will be treated as murder as soon as post-mortem examination results are confirmed.

The arrested man calmly phoned them and led them into the sitting room where Mr O’Gorman’s body was.

A senior source said: ‘This is a truly horrific killing and almost an unimaginable crime scene.’

In custody last night, the accused told officers that a row stemmed from Mr O’Gorman engaging in a chess move that was against the rules.

Sources say there was ‘nothing to indicate’ the Italian – who is from Palermo but has been in Ireland for a number of years and works for a large pharmaceutical company – was a violent or crazed person.

Mr O’Gorman and the man were said to be on ‘very friendly terms’ and were friends on Facebook.

The victim had lived on his own in 
the house after his mother, Ann, passed away two years ago. Last year he
 started renting out a room in the detached house on Beechpark Avenue in
 Castleknock, west Dublin.

Police
 have been liaising with Interpol to see if the arrested man has any 
previous convictions in Italy or elsewhere. He has never come to their 
attention before.

It is expected the accused – who has made admissions relating to the attack – will be charged today.

Security
 sources said alcohol was ‘not a factor’ in the alleged attack and that 
the accused appeared to have ‘lost it’ following the chess incident. 
Only Mr O’Gorman and his tenant were thought to be in the house at the 
time.

Mr O’Gorman 
previously worked as a journalist for the Catholic newspaper The Voice 
Today. For the past seven years, he worked as a researcher for the Iona 
Institute, the conservative organisation which promotes religion in 
society.

The scene has been sealed off for a full technical examination by forensic experts

Institute director David Quinn yesterday spoke of the organisation’s ‘total shock and deep sorrow’. He said: ‘He was a fond and dear friend and we will all miss him. We extend our deepest commiserations to his family and above all to his sister and brother, Catherine and Paul. May Tom rest in peace.’It is believed Mr O’Gorman’s brother lives in Donegal and his sister is in England. Their father, Thomas, died a number of years ago.

For the past ten years, Mr O’Gorman also served as a Minister of the Eucharist at Our Lady Mother of the Church, which is located on Beechpark Lawn, just around the corner from Mr O’Gorman’s house.

Curate Fr Denis O’Connor said Mr O’Gorman was highly respected in the community.

He told the Irish Daily Mail: ‘He was a lovely man, he was here every Sunday. It’s terrible… he was a very devout man.’ Asked how parishioners felt, he added: ‘The few that have heard it, they’re absolutely distressed and upset and troubled by it.’

Fr O’Connor added: ‘He was a gentleman, the poor man, that’s a terrible way he’s gone – no one should go like this, whatever happened. I don’t know what happened. May God give him rest and peace.’

Iona Institute director David Quinn (pictured) said: 'Tom was a friend as well as a work colleague to us all'

Rory Maguire, a friend of Mr O’Gorman’s for 20 years, lay flowers at his house last night after finding out about the killing at Mass.

He said: ‘I just broke down crying. I cried the whole way through Mass. Tom was an extraordinary person.

‘We just instantly became friends… He was tremendous, he was so funny… He was an absolute gem.’

Mr Maguire, who went to primary school with Mr O’Gorman, said Mr O’Gorman was ‘genuinely loved’.

He said: ‘He was an enormously deep person and an absolute gentleman.’

Editor of the Irish Catholic Newspaper Michael Kelly also expressed his shock. He tweeted: ‘Very sad at the murder of a friend in Castleknock. An absolute gent and all-round good guy.’

Mr O’Gorman had a BA and MLitt in history from University College Dublin and a Diploma in Legal Studies from the Dublin Institute of Technology.

One neighbour also said he attended Castleknock College.

His body was removed from the scene yesterday for a postmortem by State pathologist Professor Marie Cassidy. Last night the house remained sealed off for a forensic examination.

The Italian man remained in custody in Blanchardstown police station last night. On his Facebook page it says he is a customer service representative at Allergan pharmaceuticals. It says he has a masters in business ethics, consumption and social responsibility from the University of Siena – Arezzo.
