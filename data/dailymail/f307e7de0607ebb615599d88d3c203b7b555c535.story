John William Goodwin, 41, was convicted of breaking into 38 homes and filming 62 women and children over seven years in Brisbane

A 'peeping Tom' who broke into Brisbane homes to film himself next to sleeping women and children has been jailed for at least eight years.

John William Goodwin, 41, was convicted of breaking into 38 homes and filming 62 women and children over seven years until September 2012.

He filmed his victims, aged eight to 50, while they were sleeping, on the toilet and as they undressed, Brisbane District Court was told on Friday.

Crown prosecutor Michael Byrne said Goodwin's actions were predatory and were made worse because the women did not know they were being filmed, the Courier Mail reports.

Goodwin's predatory side was discovered after police traced child pornography featuring an eight-year-old victim being sold to a Russian website.

Police found a computer cache of 1.5 million files that Goodwin had created including 154,000 child exploitation photos, 1,193 child exploitation videos and a number of 'peeping Tom' files.

His victims lived in homes up to 2km away and videos showed him climbing up trees, fences, pergolas and gates to film the female targets whose names he spent time researching.

The court was told Goodwin also sexually assaulted some of his victims and filmed himself pulling at their blankets and touching them as they slept. The films sometimes showed Goodwin performing a sexual act on himself.

His barrister Damien Carlton tried to justify Goodwin's behaviour by saying he was offending for his own 'voyeuristic sexual gratification' that started when he was young.

Detective Inspector John Rouse said outside court that Goodwin's sentencing marked the end of a long and challenging police investigation.

'I can't imagine that any member of the public, if they had viewed some of the images and videos that we saw, would not be alarmed about the invasions of privacy that have occurred here, in the sanctity of their own homes,' he said.
