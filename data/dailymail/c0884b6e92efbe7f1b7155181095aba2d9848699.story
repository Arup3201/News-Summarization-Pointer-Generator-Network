Two Married at First stars who said 'I do' after meeting for the first time at the altar during the reality show's debut season are heading to St. Thomas to renew their vows and have the ceremony of their dreams, now that they are in love. 

Jamie Otis and Doug Hehner, from Sayreville, New Jersey, don't have a typical love story, in fact, the 28-year-old nurse, who also appeared on The Bachelor, once claimed that marrying her 32-year-old husband was the 'worst decision' of her entire life. But after four weeks of marriage, the couple made the decision to continue their relationship and decided to chronicle their marriage on the FYI channel spin-off series Married at First Sight: The First Year. 

On tonight's wedding special, Jamie and Doug return to the location of their first honeymoon to reaffirm their love for each other, but not everything is smooth sailing as Jamie's mother threatens to ruin her special day.

Look of love: Doug, 32, wraps his arms around his 28-year-old wife Jamie after they renew their vows in St. Thomas on tonight's episode of Married at First Sight: The First Year

Footage from the episode shows Jamie confronting her mother for her past behavior and missing important family events because of her history of drug use. 

'You've betrayed me and you've hurt me in the worst ways,' Jamie tells her mother over dinner.

While Jamie's mom defends herself by saying her mistakes were committed years ago, her daughter isn't entirely convinced that she has changed.   

'I can forgive, but I can't forget,' Jamie tells her.

Second chance: Jamie tells Doug that she is in love with him and wants to spend the rest of their lives together as they exchange vows on the beach - a year after their first wedding

Jamie also notes that none of her mother's displays of affection feel genuine to her.

'It's real when it's convenient for you,' she tells her mom. 

'For the past 10, 12 years my mom was on and off with drugs,' Jamie explains to the cameras. 'I am unfortunately a bit bitter.'

Despite the drama, Jamie and Doug definitely say 'I do' for the second time.

Natural look: For her second trip down the aisle, Jamie wore a simple white dress and flower crown made out of baby's breath 

A preview clip from tonight's episode shows Doug wearing a casual white button down and khaki pants as he stands by the water and waits for his wife. 

Jamie dons a simple white dress and a flower crown made out of baby's breath for her second trip down the aisle. 

'I am in love with you and I want to spend the rest of my life with,' Jamie emotionally tells Doug as they renew their vows.

The two, who were paired up by a group of relationship experts on Married at First Sight, had a rough start as newlyweds. Jamie wasn't physically attracted to Doug when she saw him at the altar and he was fully aware that she was miserable during their nuptials.

She said yes! Jamie also posted a snapshot of her diamond engagement ring paired with her wedding band and a picture of herself with her husband after she agreed to renew their vows 

Despite their past difficulties, the couple began to fall in love over the course of their honeymoon.

Two weeks ago, Jamie revealed that Doug had surprised her by proposing, sharing photos of the special moment and her diamond ring on Instagram.

'Our relationship began in the most bizarre way,' she wrote. 'Two crazy souls willing to try something new for love. And how I feel RIGHT NOW is the exact reason I believe in trying everything once. I LOVE you [sic].'

She continued: 'Who knew the experts would find the ONE guy who I could trust, love, and grow old with! Thank you for always being so patient and understanding. There's no doubt you're my perfect match! We're getting MARRIED where we had our first kiss! St Thomas! [sic].'

Bad idea: Jamie was visibly upset when she saw Doug for the first time at the altar during their wedding on season one of Married at First Sight

Split second decision: Although she wasn't initially physically attracted to Doug, Jamie eventually said 'I do'
