A businessman who stabbed his neighbour's guard dog to death as the animal attacked his pet Labrador has been cleared of acting unlawfully.

Mark Deeley was acquitted of a count of criminal damage after a district judge at Coventry Magistrates' Court accepted that the lettings agency owner believed his actions were reasonable.

Mr Deeley, of Gibbet Hill, Coventry, told the court yesterday that he had been left with no alternative other than to stab the German Shepherd after it ran into his garden to attack his dog.

Mr Deeley, who turned 50 today, had been accused of acting disproportionately when he stabbed the guard dog, named Max, as it locked its jaws around his Labrador's throat.

Clearing Mr Deeley of acting without lawful excuse, District Judge David Miller said the Labrador, named Bertie, was subjected to a serious attack which could have proved fatal.

The judge, who reached his verdict after retiring for around 25 minutes, said: ‘Mr Deeley, a dog lover, felt an immediate need to protect Bertie and he was also in fear of his own safety.

‘I have no reason to doubt that that fear was genuine.’

Mr Miller, who stressed that the verdict in no way condoned the use of any weapon against a dog, said the forensic evidence in the case also proved that the attack on Bertie was on-going when Max was stabbed.

Speaking after the verdict, Mr Deeley expressed surprise that the case had been brought to trial.

‘It has been an awful event from the very second that Max came through the hedge and attacked Bertie,’ he told reporters.

‘I was surprised that it (the prosecution) got this far, particularly as everything happened on my property.

‘I just did what I thought was right to stop the attack.’

Mr Deeley told the court yesterday that he feared Max was about to kill his 12-year-old Labrador during the incident on November 26 last year.

‘At that point I just did not feel I had any choice,’ the businessman told the court.

‘The intention was to disengage Max from Bertie and to immobilise the dog in such a way that it wouldn't come for me.

‘I used as much force as I saw was reasonable in order to prevent the attack.

'I just quite simply thought it was a brutal attack that was resulting in my dog being made ready to be killed.’

Giving evidence in the trial, his neighbour Mr Tarlo Singh, 34, struggled to hold back the tears as he recalled the moment his dog was stabbed.

He told the court he had been in the ensuite shower room when he heard the animal ‘yelp’, before falling silent.

Mr Singh said he opened his bathroom window and added: ‘I called Max over – by then I had seen Mark Deeley with a sharp object in his hand. I called Max over, but by then it was too late.’

After a break to allow the witness to compose himself, Mr Singh continued: ‘All I heard was a crying noise…I saw him stab the dog. I shouted to Max three times but got no response.’

The properties stand in 1.5 acre plots of land on the outskirts of Coventry, overlooking greenbelt that separates the city from the Warwickshire town of Kenilworth.
