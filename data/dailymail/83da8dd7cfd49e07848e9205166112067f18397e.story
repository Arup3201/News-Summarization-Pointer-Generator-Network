A Welshman and his Kiwi girlfriend have been rescued from their stricken yacht in the South Pacific two days after it rolled in high seas.

The Hong Kong cargo ship Chengtu rescued Steve Jones, 52, and New Zealander Tania Davies, 43 from their 38-foot yacht 'Windigo' on Friday morning.

According to authorities, the pair left the island of Tonga on Tuesday and traveled about 430miles (700kilometers) southwest.

Concerns: Mr Jones' mother Elizabeth from Conwy, Wales, said she had originally feared her son's yacht 'Windigo' would sink after turning over in the storm

They activated an emergency beacon Wednesday evening after the boat rolled in 30-foot (9.2-meter) high seas and strong winds.

Maritime New Zealand spokesman Steve Rendle says the yacht was taking on water after hatches and portholes smashed.

Mr Rendle added the pair were in good
health. During their ordeal, Australia-based Mr Jones suffered a head 
gash and back injury while Ms Davies also knocked her head.Â 

On Thursday Mr Jones' mother Elizabeth from Llandudno Junction in Conwy, Wales, told the BBC she had originally feared her son's yacht 'Windigo' would sink after turning over in the storm.

A New Zealand Air Force P3-Orion plane had successfully dropped the pair a life raft, but a full rescue operation was delayed due to bad weather.

Mr Jones is an experienced yachtsman who has been sailing for more than 25 years.

He has been living on board the yacht for around two-and-a-half-years and in Australia for years before that.

He and Ms Davies were travelling from Tonga to New Zealand when the storm hit.
