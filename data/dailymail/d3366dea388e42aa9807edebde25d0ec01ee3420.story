Katie Holmes' lawyer has confirmed her highly-publicised divorce with Tom Cruise has been settled, as reports emerge she will have 'sole custody' of their six-year-old daughter Suri.

It seems the couple have reached an agreement out of court, meaning the actor's beloved Scientology is no longer at risk of scrutiny with the religion's secrets being dissected during a trial.

Jonathan Wolfe said: 'This case has been settled and the agreement has been signed.'

Speaking to TMZ, he added: 'We are thrilled for Katie and her family and are excited to watch as she embarks on the next chapter of her life.

Life in the spotlight: As she released a joint statement with estranged 
husband Tom Cruise regarding the dissolution of their marriage, and her lawyer confirmed a settlement, Katie Holmes seemed to be in high spirits

'We thank Tom's counsel for their professionalism and diligence that helped bring about this speedy resolution'.

According to TMZ, while Katie has sole custody of Suri, Tom will still get significant custodial time with his daughter.

Apparently the agreement also includes details on what Tom and Katie are allowed to tell Suri regarding religion, including Scientology.

The restrictions are eased as Suri gets older, the website reports.

A separate source, speaking to Radar, also revealed that Suri will remain with Katie in New York, where they currently reside, and will be accompanied by her own nanny and team of bodyguards when she visits father Tom on weekly occasions. However an insider who spoke to TMZ has disputed this.

The insider told Radar: 'Katie insisted that Suri's nanny and bodyguards always accompany her when she visits Tom... This will ensure a smooth and easy transition for Suri when she is with Tom.

'Suri is Katie's number one priority.
 Tom only has Scientologists that work for him and Katie insisted that 
her staff will always be with their daughter.

'Under
 terms of the settlement, Suri isn't permitted to be exposed to anything
 Scientology related and this includes going to any Scientology 
churches, parties, etc. Katie made sure that this was ironclad.'

Suri
 will also not be expected to attend a Scientology school, like Cruise’s
 adopted children with ex-wife Nicole Kidman, Isabella, now 19, and 
Conor, 17, did.

Fingers began pointing even before reasons of their split came to surface.

And
 earlier today, the rumours circulating their difference in religious opinion, 
notably the Cocktail actor's rigid Scientology beliefs, appear to have 
been confirmed in a joint statement from the couple.

Released by their representatives, the notice states that they will continue to work together as parents and 'express our respect for each other's commitment to each of our respective beliefs'.

It's
 also quite the paradox they have asked for privacy, considering the 
charade Tom displayed with his infamous jumping on the sofa as a 
declaration of love for Katie during an interview with Oprah.

The
 formerly named TomKat reached their divorce settlement today - filed 
unexpectedly by Katie in the last week of June - and would have been 
fighting for custody of their six-year-old daughter Suri.

The statement, released today, said: 'We are 
committed to working together as parents to accomplish what is in our 
daughter Suri's best interests.

'We want to keep matters affecting our 
family private and express our respect for each other's commitment to 
each of our respective beliefs and support each other's roles as 
parents.'

One Hollywood source said that Cruise, 50, had agreed to pay a 'substantial' sum to his soon-to-be third ex-wife in property, assets and child support.

A pre-nuptial agreement is said to have limited the amount he was obliged to pay, but sources say he would almost certainly have included a 'goodwill' payoff to help bring talks to a speedy conclusion.

New favourite haunt: Katie and Suri returned to the Children's Musuem of the Arts after visiting last week

Yesterday, 33-year-old Katie was seen enjoying a girls day out with her daughter.

She looked confident within herself, 
smiling for photographers while dressed casually in a double denim 
ensemble of flared jeans and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up.

The pair were seen taking a taxi to 
the Children's Museum of the Arts, which seems to be a new favourite 
with the child after they were spotted at the same venue last week with a
 group of friends.

To coincide with the joint statement, more evidence has emerged that Katie had 
been planning to leave Tom for months before making the 
announcement on June 29.

A new report has claimed that she 
made the decision to fire Cruise's 19-year-old daughter Bella two months previously as 
she worked for the actress' clothing line Holmes and Yang.

A source told the Hollywood Reporter that while Bella was stunned by the news, it has all started to make sense in the wake of the divorce announcement.

The source said: 'There was never any
 trouble between them. Bella called Katie "Mom." She was fired out of 
the blue, and once Katie filed for divorce, it all made sense.

'This was a carefully planned ambush. Katie didn’t want Bella working for her anymore because she was Tom’s kid.'

'Carefully planned ambush': Katie Holmes fired Tom Cruise's daughter Bella, seen here with the actress in 2010, two months ago when she was working for her clothing line Holmes and Yang, it has been claimed

The
 decision to fire Bella was one of the first attempts Katie made to 
stand up to Cruise and the religious organisation of Scientology, of 
which the actor is a very vocal member.

Happier times: Katie is said to have been planning her split from Cruise for months

Tom's lawyer, Bert Fields, said of the agreement: 'Tom is really pleased we got there, and so am I.'

Katie filed for divorce under the names 'Anonymous vs Anonymous' - signalling her intention of trying to keep details private.

Karen De La Carriere, a former Scientology executive who had been married to Scientology's president Heber Jentzsch, who has been missing for years, told the publication that Katie's move was extremely courageous.

She said: 'This was a very bold move on Katie’s part, but at the same time she knows these are different times and she has more support.

'Katie ambushed Tom and in so 
doing outwitted some of the most controlling people on Earth.'

Ex-Scientologist Marty Rathbun claimed that the actor and church leadership wanted to 'buy silence at any price'.

He said the agreement is likely to contain a clause 'that indicates Scientology was never an issue nor consideration in the filing for divorce'.

Marc Headley, who was aided by police when he left the church in 
2005, said: 'You're either in or out when it comes to Scientology.

'That’s why Katie is making custody such an issue in the divorce 
petition. If you’re out, the way she seems to be, they want to cut you 
off from everyone, including your kids.'

And with art imitating life, Katie begins shooting Molly next month - a film about a single mother.
