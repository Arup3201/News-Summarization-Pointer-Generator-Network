Drivers who struggle to reverse into tight spaces need worry no more for Bosch has developed an app that will take over the entire process.

The automatic parking system involves installing 12 sensors into a car which scan the road and park up, without any bumps or scrapes.

So sophisticated is the technology that the driver can run the parking process from the side of the road using an app on their smartphone.

The app that parks your car: Bosch's automatic parking system involves installing 12 sensors into a car which scan the road and park a car directed by an app without any bumps or scrapes

It is thought the system will be particularly useful in Britain and Europe, where parking spaces in supermarkets, offices and public multi-storeys are notoriously tight.

The automatic parking assist system was unveiled by German electronics company at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.

The system is the latest evidence to show that drivers will increasingly become passengers as computers take over the business of getting from A to B.

In a separate development, Samsung has unveiled a new app involving its Gear smartwatch, which can communicate with and control some aspects of BMW’s new i3 electric car.

Bosch Chairman Werner Struth has said he believes driverless cars will be a reality but they will arrive gradually, with this driver assistance technology marking the first step.

Some car manufacturers already offer parking assist, where an on-board computer and sensors take over the process of steering while the driver pushes the brake and accelerator.  

However, the new Bosch design goes one step further to take over the entire process.

Demonstrating the technology, Fred Sejalon, engineering manager at Bosch, said: ‘The vehicle is fitted with 12 ultra-sonic sensors and when the driver wishes to park they just have to enable the system and sensors start scanning the environment.

‘If a suitable parking space is found the driver can either stay in the vehicle or step out and, using their smartphone, let the vehicle do the rest. The system controls vehicle speed and the steering wheel and gear shift.’

The technology, which will be available next year, will also help drivers from wandering out of their lane on the motorway.

The system will be pre-installed in new cars by a range of manufacturers, who have not yet been named. In theory, it may also be possible to add it to older cars, providing they have an on-board computer that allows control of the steering and gears.

Mr Sejalon said: ‘This is good for everybody, especially for parking in a traffic situation or anybody who doesn’t feel comfortable parallel or perpendicular parking, especially when the visibility is limited.

‘There is a lot of hype about autonomous driving and that is a stepping stone in that direction.’

The company is already working on the next advance in the technology, which will allow drivers to drop their car at the entrance of a car park. It will then negotiate its way through the building to find a spare space.

This system - dubbed valet parking – would also allow the motorist to retrieve the vehicle by starting it up remotely with a smartphone.

Bosch also unveiled technology to brake a car if it detects a pedestrian or an obstacle in the road.

The automatic emergency breaking system uses a sensor mounted behind the windscreen to sense dangers in the path of the car, and halt if the driver fails to.

Xavier Zhu, a technical manager at Bosch, said: ‘The sensors works in the manner of the human eye.‘There is a camera that sees what the driver sees but can measure the distance of any obstacle, be it pedestrians or obstacles in the road, and can give a signal to the brakes to engage if the driver is not paying attention.’

This technology will come pre-installed in cars and the reaction time can be adjusted according to manufacturer specifications.

BMW’s new electric car the i3 is installed with a mobile phone SIM card that links to the vehicles on-board computer.

Samsung has developed an App that works with its smartphones and the Galaxy Gear smartwatch that can connect to the car’s controls.

The smartwatch screen will show the status of the BMW i3’s battery charge and current drivable range, check that the doors are locked and provide alerts about the need for a service.

Users can also remotely regulate the temperature of their BMW i3’s interior before getting in the car by using the touchscreen on a Samsung phone or a voice command.
