Off button: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is planning an end to Britain's 'holiday camp jails', with plans including no Sky TV in cells, uniforms and less pocket money

An end to Britain’s ‘holiday camp’ jails, with a ban on Sky TV, fewer televisions, more prison uniforms, less pocket money for inmates and a ban on gay couples sharing cells is planned by the Government.

The return to ‘spartan’ jails marks the biggest prison regime shake-up for 60 years and is designed to signal a tough new approach to law and order by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.

Mr Grayling believes prisoners do not deserve the kind of lifestyle and ‘frills’ that are beyond the reach of families on low wages.

The move will provoke fierce opposition from prison reformers, but Mr Grayling says that making prison life tougher is a vital part of his war on crime.

‘I want prisons to be spartan, but humane, a place people don’t have a particular desire to come back to,’ he said in an interview with The Mail on Sunday.

In his new ‘no-frills’ prisons:

And in a toughening-up of sentencing policies, Mr Grayling wants to stop people who carry knives for violent purposes from being let off with cautions.

Spartan: He said that he wanted prions to be 'spartan but humane' and said he didn't want it to be a place people had a 'desire' to come back to

Rape and violence should be prosecuted wherever possible, he says.

Speaking in his Commons office, Mr Grayling, 50, said: ‘It isn’t reasonable for prisoners to enjoy things that those outside on low incomes would struggle to have. My idea of prison is not sitting watching the Sky Sports Sunday match. I accept that, given they are locked up for a long time, prisoners should have access to a TV set,  but it is a privilege that should be earned, not given automatically. They should not get all the frills.

‘I don’t approve of prisons buying state-of-the-art entertainment kit when most people have to make sacrifices to buy them.’

Soft-spoken MP for leafy Epsom in Surrey, Chris Grayling is anything but brutal by nature.

A former Channel 4 business reporter and ex-member of the Social Democrat Party, a forerunner of the Lib Dems, he is not from the Tories’ old-style hang ’em and flog ’em brigade.

But his new ‘spartan’ jails policy is final proof that David Cameron’s ‘hug a hoodie’ phase is well and truly over.

He appointed Grayling to succeed Tory veteran Ken Clarke after Tory MPs complained Hush Puppy-wearing Clarke’s softly-softly stance on crime was losing votes.

Arguably, the harsher prison regime is the most significant change since hard labour and flogging were outlawed in British jails in 1948.

Change: He said that 'all aspects of prison life' were being considered as part of the shakeup

Not that Grayling intends to copy US prison chain gangs.

‘I would much rather someone was in a workshop learning a skill than breaking rocks to no purpose,’ he tells me.

The first change will be a ban on Sky Sports and other subscription satellite TV.

Grayling chuckles as he recalls checking to make sure prisoners were not using it to watch pornography.

‘I asked, “Do they have access to Red Hot Dutch?” And no, they don’t.’

In addition to being able to watch Sky TV, prisoners are allowed TVs in their cells in return for good behaviour.

Now, some prisoners face having them removed as  the ‘good behaviour’ threshold is increased. Similarly, the right to wear their own clothes and the right to buy treats in prison shops are likely to be restricted.

‘We are looking at in what circumstances should they have access to a TV set, wear their own clothes, things like that,’ says Grayling.

‘Prisoners get extra privileges and resources through good behaviour. We may tighten that regime. We are considering all aspects of prison life.’

And he is not prepared to tolerate  the practice, said to be growing, whereby some gay inmates live as couples in cells, allowing them to have sex regularly.

Limit: Grayling also wants governors to do more to stop prisoners getting hold of drugs and mobile phones, which give them access to Facebook, allowing them to threaten those outside who have given evidence against them

‘It is not acceptable to allow same-sex couples to effectively move in together and live a domestic life. If such a thing happened, I would want those prisoners put in separate prisons.’

Grayling also wants governors to do more to stop prisoners getting hold of drugs and mobile phones, which give them access to Facebook, allowing them to threaten those outside who have given evidence against them. 

‘It has been a revelation to me the means people use to get these things into prisons,’ he says. ‘A dead bird was thrown over a prison wall with drugs in and a prisoner came along and picked it up on the other side.’

Grayling also wants to ban trouble-making prisoners from having jail terms automatically slashed. ‘I have a problem with the idea that someone who does not co-operate in prison gets early release.’

And he wants to cut the police  use of cautions, seen as a ‘let-off’ by Tory critics.

‘I have serious misgivings about the number of people cautioned for carrying a knife – and I’m not talking about someone on their way home after buying a Stanley knife at B&Q.’

Rapists and violent thugs should also be prosecuted wherever possible, he says.

His disciplinarian views are mirrored by the ‘regime’ he and wife Susan adopted towards their two children, now 20 and 16. He says when they misbehaved they knew they could get a smack from dad.

‘You chastise children when they are bad, as my parents did me. I’m not opposed to smacking. It is to  be used occasionally. Sometimes it sends a message – but I don’t hanker for the days when children were severely beaten at school.’

Since entering the Commons in 2001, Grayling has got into trouble more than once for his hardline views.

Learning: The MP said he would much prefer if prisoners were in a 'workshop learning a skill than breaking rocks to no purpose'

He was branded the Tory ‘attack dog’ for accusing Cherie Blair of making money from living at Downing Street and he was forced to apologise after rashly comparing Manchester’s Moss Side area to ‘urban war’ in the American TV crime drama The Wire.

He was also branded ‘bigot of the year’ after  saying Christians who ran bed-and-breakfast businesses should have the right to turn away homosexuals.

The gaffe cost him dearly.

When David Cameron became Prime Minister, Theresa May, not Grayling, was made Home Secretary, and he had to settle for being a lowly number-cruncher for Iain Duncan Smith at Work and Pensions.

He won Cabinet promotion last year after Mr Cameron finally lost patience with Mr Clarke as Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor and gave the job to Grayling.

He says his main aim is to stop the vicious circle in which no sooner have prisoners been released than they commit another crime and  go back inside. Spartan jails and humane rehabilitation go hand-in-hand, he insists.

‘We have a good number of evil Mr Bigs in our prisons, but many prisoners are badly messed up and we have to help them. Whether you are the hardest hardliner or the woolliest liberal, every one of us has an interest in preventing reoffending.’
