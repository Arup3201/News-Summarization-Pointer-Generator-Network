A Washington State toddler lost several toes after being accidentally run over by a ride-on lawnmower.

Juliette Nau-Johnson, two, was staying with her father in Sandpoint on Monday when the heart-breaking accident took place.

The child normally stays with her single mother, Lesley Johnson, who rushed to her daughter's side at the local hospital's emergency room.

Horrific: Two-year-old Juliette Nau-Johnson lost several toes after she was reportedly run over by a riding lawnmower on Monday

'I work as a nurse but I need to be able
to be with her,' Lesley Johnson told KXLY.com in Spokane. 'At least she's going to be in the hospital for months.

'She's already (saying) 'I want to go home, I want to go home' that's all she keeps saying to me, I want to go home.'

Following the accident, Juliette was airlifted to Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center, where doctors revealed the extent of her injuries to her waiting mom, according to KXLY.com.

'I met her the second they landed, they came and got me and I went to the ER to be with her,' Lesley Johnson reportedly said.

Prognosis: Doctor's are hopeful little Juliette will walk again, but her mother said it's going to be a long road to recovery

'The toes on her left foot are all gone, except for the baby toe and I think there's some damage to the heel there.'

So far, Juliette has had two surgeries in the last three days to clean out the wounds, according to KXLY.com.

Doctor's are hopeful Juliette will be able to walk again, but her mother said it's going to be a long road to recovery.

'My No. 1 thing is I want my daughter to be able to come home to her house that she loves so much,' Johnson reportedly said, according to KXLY.com.

Ms Johnson is a single mother and as she takes off work to be by her daughter's side, she worries about how she'll pay her $1,400 a month mortgage.

The horrific affair has sparked an online donation drive to assist Lesley and Juliette as they cope with the aftermath.

On a Facebook page set up to promote the drive, dozens of people from around the nation expressed their regards for the mother-daughter duo, and contributed money to keep Lesley by her child's side.

'Praying for you little one,' read one post, while another writer penned the following: 'Poor little baby..I wish for a speedy recovery!'Â
