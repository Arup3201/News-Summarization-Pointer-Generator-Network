Former Voice Australia star Sabrina Batshon has been granted an interim apprehended violence order against her former friend and actor Alex Haddad, after a court hearing today heard Haddad's actions had left her 'petrified to wake up each morning'.

Ms Batshon has been embroiled in a public spat with Mr Haddad, who took out his own AVO against the singer in July.

The feud between the pair escalated until they appeared in a tell-all interview on Nine's A Current affair on Monday night.

Sabrina Batshon was accompanied by boyfriend Simon Saade as she fronted Parramatta court on Tuesday

Ms Batshon said in court today that Haddad tried to blacklist her and destroy her career, as well as making threatening calls to her friends and family

Ms Batshon fronted Parramatta Local Court, in Sydney's west, on Tuesday after she too made an application for an AVO against Mr Haddad.

But Mr Haddad was not present in court. His lawyer Leon Apostle said his client was not at court because 'the matter has received a lot of media.' 

Ms Batshon told the court that Mr Haddad got close to her when he heard she was set to appear on The Voice Australia. He would drive her to and from auditions and acted as her support, the court heard.

'He threatened to destroy my career' the voice singer said in her application to the court. 'He has blacklisted me.'

'He made phone calls to my father and best friend 'Jason' and I have evidence he threatened me,' she told the court.

Ms Batshon said she was a former friend of Mr Haddad and was 'never' in a relationship with him. She said she had an argument at her home after she decided to take another friend, Joe Davidson, with her to voice auditions.

'He followed through with blackmail to try an destroy my career. He wanted to be in a relationship with me.'

Magistrate Joan Baptie read a string of text messages submitted by Batshon's lawyer that were from Mr Haddad trying to discredit Ms Batshon.

An emotional Ms Batshon also told the court Facebook posts by Mr Haddad were also threatening to her career and that he made numerous false claims.

Haddad was spotted alone in Newtown at the time he was expected to appear at Parramatta Court

The pair have been embroilled in a public spat since July, when Mr Haddad took out his own AVO against the singer

'He claimed somebody raped me, I had to clear his name, it wasn't true,' Batshon said.

'He said I sleep around.'

While Haddad had never assaulted the singer she says: 'I am petrified waking up every morning.'

Mr Haddad declined to give evidence in court, but his lawyer Leon Apostle challenged Ms Batshon's credibility.

'This whole ordeal is just for people to feel sorry for you,' he said.

'No of course not,' she replied.

Magistrate Joan Baptie said it was appropriate to grant an interim order based on Batshon's testimony.

'It is clear on some material, mutual mud slinging between parties and includes some immaturity with both parties.'

Outside court Me Haddad's lawyer said his client was harmless.

'Thank god we have a judiciary that will listen to both sides before reaching a conclusion,' said Mr Apostle.

Ms Batshon said she was happy with the outcome and that the judge was fair.

'He can't come near me or my loved ones and continue what he's been doing, going to the media' she said.

'Any move forward is a step in the right direction'

'I do think Alex is genuinely unwell, I hope for his sake he stops this' she said.

The matter is again up for mention in court on November 18th.
