A judge rejected shamed former IMF leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s claim for diplomatic immunity, saying the defence was a ‘Hail Mary' pass.

Bronx state Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon wrote in his decision that ‘his voluntary resignation from the IMF terminated any immunity which he enjoyed.

‘Mr Strauss-Kahn threw (legally speaking, that is) his own version of a Hail Mary pass,’ he wrote.

Hail Mary: A judge has rejected DSK's request for immunity, calling it a 'Hail Mary' pass. The former IMF chief, pictured in Manhattan Criminal Court last May

Judge McKeon said that as soon as Strauss-Kahn willingly resigned as the chief of IMF, he surrendered any immunity he had.

The judge heard arguments in March on the civil case that emerged from the May 2011 hotel-room encounter that also spurred now-dismissed criminal charges against Strauss-Kahn, then a French presidential contender. 

The episode was the first in a series of allegations about the sexual conduct that sank his political career.

Ms Diallo's lawyers issued a statement calling the ruling 'well-reasoned and articulate.'

'We have said all along that Strauss Kahn's desperate plea for immunity was a tactic designed to delay these proceedings and we now look forward to holding him accountable for the brutal sexual assault that he committed,' they wrote.

Strauss-Kahn's attorneys had no immediate comment on the ruling.

Accused: DSK was accused of raping a maid at the Sofitel Hotel in Midtown Manhattan

Accuser: Nafissatou Diallo (seen in August 2011) claimed DSK tried to rape her in May 2011 when she entered his suite to clean his room

He has been weighing whether or not to allow the lawsuit to go forward. The housekeeper, Nafissatou Diallo, 33, said Strauss-Kahn, 63, tried to rape her when she arrived to clean his suite at the posh Sofitel Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. 

Strauss-Kahn has denied doing anything violent during the encounter.Prosecutors dropped related criminal charges last summer, saying they had developed doubts about her trustworthiness because she had lied about her background and her actions right after the alleged attack.

She has insisted she told the truth about what happened in the encounter itself.

Out to lunch: DSK was seen in Paris last month getting a bite to eat

Strauss-Kahn didn't assert immunity from the criminal prosecution, and he resigned his IMF job days after his arrest. 

But his lawyers argued he should be immune from the lawsuit, which was filed about three months later. They say his job title afforded him the luxury under international rules.

But Ms Diallo's lawyers said the immunity claim is off base.

They stressed that an IMF spokesman said shortly after Strauss-Kahn's arrest that he didn't have immunity because he was on personal business during his encounter with Ms Diallo.

Strauss-Kahn was visiting his daughter in New York.

The Associated Press generally doesn't name people who report being sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Ms Diallo has done.

After Strauss-Kahn's arrest in New York, a French writer came forward to say Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her during a 2003 interview.

Paris prosecutors said that accusation was too old to try, but French authorities have pursued an unrelated allegation that he was involved in a hotel prostitution ring including prominent city figures and police in Lille.

In March, he was handed preliminary charges, which mean authorities have reason to believe a crime was committed but allow more time for investigation.

His French lawyer said the married Strauss-Kahn engaged in 'libertine' acts but did nothing legally wrong and is being unfairly targeted for his extramarital sex life.
