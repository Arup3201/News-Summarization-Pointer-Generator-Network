So it wasn't quite the 'celebration of football' Roberto Martinez hoped it would be but, on this occasion, he didn't grumble.

Having made light work of progressing through Group H, dismantling Wolfsburg and Lille en route to the last 32 of the Europa League, Everton's manager took the chance to experiment and give opportunities to the 'diamonds of our Academy' in an environment free from pressure.

But, as it turned out, this transpired to be a game that will not live long in the memory, not even for those who were given their first starts against Krasnodar. On a rain-sodden Merseyside night, Everton ended the Europa League group stage with a lacklustre defeat.

Ratings by DOMINIC KING at Goodison Park

A goal from Ricardo Laborde in the first half, when he capitalised on dreadful goalkeeping from Joel Robles, gave Krasnodar victory yet Martinez will not be unduly concerned. Never one to dwell on a negative, he saw this as a worthwhile experiment after they overcame initial stage fright.

'I thought the first half was really cagey, the second half was completely different,' said Martinez. 'They got a unique experience and after this, we have different footballers. It was very pleasing to see the way they progressed. It was just a shame we couldn't get a positive result.'

Much of the interest beforehand centred on Arouna Kone, who had celebrated two birthdays since he last kicked a ball in public for Everton's first team. This, the Ivorian hoped, would be the beginning of what he called a 'big comeback'.

Yet a closer examination of the teamsheet showed there were other stories, not least the promotion of 17-year-old Ryan Ledson, a young midfielder for whom Martinez has high hopes. So do England, as illustrated by Under 21 head coach Gareth Southgate's attendance.

Ledson, who has been at Everton's Academy since he was five, has enjoyed a memorable 12 months. He signed his first professional contract in August, having lead England's Under-17s to success in Malta in the European Championships.

Given a key role in midfield, Ledson worked hard and showed an impressive understanding of the game. He used the ball smartly and never being afraid to bark out orders to those with more experience – Gareth Barry, playing as a central defender, would testify to that.

Showing what Martinez described as 'football arrogance', Ledson was the pick of a bunch that included Conor McAleny, Kieran Dowell – who replaced the hamstrung Christian Atsu – and Chris Long. This is unlikely to be the last time you hear about him.

'You need days like to day – it is one in a lifetime,' said Martinez. 'It was just a real shame that some of them were shocked in the first half but you saw what they could do in the second half.'

 GROUP H FINAL STANDINGS

Ricardo Laborde pounced on poor goalkeeper from Joel Robles to score for Krasnodar - CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE

Everton, to their credit, slashed the price of tickets in an attempt to a get a healthy pre-Christmas crowd – the most expensive was £15 – but the crackle you associate with this stadium on a European night was absent. This, effectively, was an exhibition match.

Still, it was one Everton wanted to win. Their progress in Europe so far has been serene and they had the first opportunity in the 14th minute, when Kone latched on to a pass from McAleny and drilled a 25-yard shot that Krasnodar keeper Andrei Sinitsin beat away.

Krasnodar, though, had not travelled just to fulfil their obligations and in the 16th minute Wanderson, the Brazilian striker, burst clear and smashed a shot straight at Robles that left the keeper with a bloodied nose.

The blow seemed to cloud his senses as, he was found wanting when Krasnodar broke away,  Laborde, their Colombian midfielder, latched on to a ball from Marat Izmailov to open the scoring.

Robles should have done better. He didn't know whether to dive at Laborde's feet or stand tall and did neither. Laborde squeezed his shot inside the near post to leave Goodison silent, save for the 14 cheering fans who had made a 2,000-mile trek here from Russia.

A similar pattern followed after the break. Everton played at a higher tempo but never looked like equalising. If anything, Krasnodar should have doubled their lead but Izamailov fluffed his lines after Robles was caught in no man's land. By then, they had done enough. Still Martinez was content.

'It's part of what we want to achieve to develop our youngsters,' he said. 'If we don't give them opportunities they will never learn.'
