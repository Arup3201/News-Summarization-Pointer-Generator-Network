Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says he is ready to unleash Raheem Sterling on Real Madrid – even though the teenager played 95 minutes against QPR on Sunday.

Rodgers has rejected claims that Sterling said he was 'tired' while on England duty although he has talked himself about the dangers of burn-out facing the 19-year-old.

Sterling certainly looked fresh when he embarked on the injury-time run that set up Liverpool's goal in a 3-2 win at Loftus Road and Rodgers is confident he can show the same verve and energy on Wednesday night despite having only 72 hours to recover.

'Raheem has shown over the last couple of years he has the ability and quality to reproduce performances like that,' said Rodgers. 'He was a real catalyst but it was no surprise to see him at that level.

'He showed wonderful speed, technique and, of course, hard work. So there is no doubt he can arrive into this game (v Real) like he's done since I've been here.'

Rodgers has had to regularly field questions about why Liverpool have fallen short of last season's standards when they ran Manchester City close to winning the Premier League.

A big turnaround in personnel over the summer has created inconsistent results and in the Champions League a home win against Ludogorets was followed by a disappointing 1-0 loss in Basle.

Rogers feels the arrvial of The Galacticos could inspire his players.

'We understand it is a very important game for us and obviously a great challenge,' he said. 'This group really lift ourselves for the big games.

'We haven't got to the levels of last season but this is a special game in a special competition. But knowing the competitors we have in our team, I am confident we will rise to the challenge of Real Madrid.

'It is still going to be a difficult game. They are a squad of top-class players. Of course Ronaldo is arguably the best in the world, his evolution from a soloist who scored goals to a goalscorer has been impressive.

'But we need to have a plan for our team first to cause them problems, and then work out a way of stoppoing them, as a team.'

On Gareth Bale's injury, Rodgers added: 'He is a world-class player, he's got fantastic speed so of course if he is not playing it can be an advantage. But their squad is fantastic, they can bring players like Isco so the advantage isn't significant and certainly they will test us in the game.

'For us, although it is a difficult tie for us and we aren't playing as well as we have done, people haven't focussed on our character and spirit and it's that which is allowing us to win games.

'We need that on Wednesday to go with quality of our football to take another step to qulaifying from the group.'

Captain Steven Gerrard called on the team to improve from their win at QPR if they want to trouble Madrid.

And on Tuesday night at the official pre-match Champions League press conference, he explained: 'We have been a bit up and down, in a bit of a stuttering season. Everyone is well aware we have lost a phenomenal player in Suarez and struggled getting Sturridge on the field, so it is only natural we would have teething problems.

'But I have huge confidence in these players we can get back to the level we had last season. It won't be very long.'
