Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is either preparing a presidential campaign announcement or executing a 4,000 square foot head-fake in Midtown Manhattan with an office rental that was made public on Tuesday.

She has reportedly inked a two-year lease on space in a skyscraper on 45th Street near Times Square – a building owned by the brother of a one-time New York City Democratic candidate for mayor.

The 27th floor suite has floor-to-ceiling windows, Times Square views and enough room for 25 staffers.

Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman told MSNBC that the site is already in use – as the New York pol's personal office, not a presidential campaign headquarters.

That directly contradicts a report on HollywoodLife.com, whose employees first spotted Clinton perusing the office space in the building where they work.

Its
 breathless pronouncement: 'Hillary has signed a two-year lease. ... If 
you’re not doing the math, that adds up to the year 2016.'

August 2016, that is. Three months short of Election Day.

A Democratic political operative in Washington told MailOnline that Merrill is likely shooting straight.

'No
 one, not even Hillary, would base a national presidential campaign in 
New York City in 2016,' he said.

'Think of the message that would send 
to the flyover states.'

'And two dozen office staff isn't even enough people to pass out the walking-around money, much less run a campaign like that.'

Clinton also has office space at her family foundation's office near Rockefeller Center, just five blocks away. 

'This
 could just be Hillary's way of putting some distance between her 
personal office and the Clinton Foundation,' the consultant added, 'in 
case there are issues with the nonprofit housing some of her for-profit 
stuff like book-signing tours and all of that.'

'You really don't want to cross the IRS when you're gearing up to run for president.'

Clinton 
also seized the opportunity to cozy up to New York City's Democratic 
establishment when choosing an office.

The building where she signed a 
lease is owned by the brother of Mark Green, the party's mayoral 
candidate who lost to Michael Bloomberg in 2001.

HollywoodLife reported that Clinton's new suite includes nine offices, 14 workstations and a large conference room. The building features 53 parking spaces, although Clinton's Secret Service detail may just elect to idle on the curb.

The ground floor features a swanky Bobby Van's steakhouse. SL Green Realty Corp. boasts that 'a major capital improvement program was completed in 2011 with renovations to the outdoor plaza and lobby, which feature magnificent large scale hanging lit sculptures' and a 'cascading water wall.'

Clinton, whose poll numbers have dipped since the release of her memoirs, is expected to announce by year's end whether or not she will seek the White House.

If she stays out of the race, a personal office in the Big Apple could help her differentiate her activities from her lecherous husband's personal brand in their declining years.
