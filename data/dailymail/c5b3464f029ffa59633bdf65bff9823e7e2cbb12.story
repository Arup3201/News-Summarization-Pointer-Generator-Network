As Europe’s largest military base, it is home to more than 12,000 Army personnel and their families.

So it must have come as a surprise to the soldiers of Catterick Garrison when they discovered that the Military Wives charity single was nowhere to be seen in their local Tesco.

Not least because the whole idea for the record came from a member of the garrison’s own Wags choir of servicemen’s wives and girlfriends.

The Military Wives on Oxford Street on Tuesday. Their charity single 'Wherever You Are' is currently outselling the rest of the top 20 combined

But surprise turned to anger when they were told by Tesco that its store in the North Yorkshire Army base was ‘too small’ to stock the song, Wherever You Are – even though it was big enough for Little Mix’s X Factor song, Cannonball.

The ban on the Military Wives single led to heartfelt protests from a battalion of disappointed locals. And last night Tesco was beating a hasty retreat on its decision.

Retired headmistress Glennis Walton, from nearby Scotton, tried to buy the single – which is outselling the rest of the Top 20 combined and is expected to be the Christmas number one – on Wednesday.

‘They told me the store isn’t big enough,’ she said. ‘Well, it’s big enough to take the money from the military personnel.

‘I’ve never been 'incandescent of Scotton' before, but I feel very strongly about this.’ Mrs Walton was forced to buy the single online instead.

Another shopper, Jennie Pinkney, of nearby Richmond, was equally appalled when she and her husband tried to buy the single on Monday.

‘He was looking for the disc and he caught up with me and said, 'You’ll not believe it – they don’t have the single',’ she said.

The Tesco in Catterick claims it is 'too small' to stock the charity single

‘I went up to the help desk and they told me the store was too small to stock the Military Wives single. I was furious about it. This is a Tesco store that is in the heart of the biggest military base in Western Europe.

‘They had the X Factor girls’ single. I don’t have anything against them, good luck to them, but military servicemen’s wives work at this Tesco, and military personnel use the store.

'Given the price of the single, it’s the kind of thing children would want to buy for their parents who are serving in the forces.

Catterick Garrison is the largest British Army garrison in the world with a population of around 12,000, plus a large temporary population of soldiers.

It is said to be the largest army base in Europe.

It is not a single fenced base, but several separate barracks around which a town has developed.

The Garrison gained its first large supermarket, a Tesco, in 2000 along with a retail park including a McDonald's.

‘We have a history of RAF service in our family so I was appalled they did not stock the single. The girls on the help desk said they would pass my concerns higher up the chain after my complaint.’

Local businessman Alasdair MacConachie, who chairs the garrison’s independent advisory panel, said: ‘It’s a great shame they have not got behind this.

‘They should be doing what they can to support it.'

In the face of the onslaught, Tesco was last night shipping copies of the single to the garrison.

A spokesman said the supermarket chain’s customers tended to purchase and download singles online, so it did not generally stock them in its stores.

But he added: ‘This is a special charity project we are pleased to be supporting. The single is available in 205 of our stores and on December 26 it will be available in 458.’

The Military Wives were formed by choirmaster Gareth Malone for BBC2 programme The Choir. He was given the idea by a member of Catterick Garrison Wags Choir.

The single is raising money for the Royal British Legion and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen And Families Association.

The Treasury said this week that it has agreed to give a sum equivalent to the VAT on sales of the single to the appeal.
