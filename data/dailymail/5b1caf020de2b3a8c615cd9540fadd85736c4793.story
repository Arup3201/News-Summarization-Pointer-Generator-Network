Big time: Amir Khan remains in pole position to fight Mayweather and could do so next May

Mayweather, who beat Marcos Maidana last month to remain unbeaten in 46 fights, will return to the ring on September 13.

Khan, however, has ruled himself out as he will not be fit enough having celebrated the Muslim fast of Ramadan.

The British welterweight expects to fight in October or November having made a successful debut at the weight against Luis Collazo in Las Vegas.
