Newcastle have placed a £14million price tag on midfielder Cheick Tiote after rejecting a bid from Lokomotiv Moscow.

The Russians want Tiote to replace Lassana Diarra who is a target for Queens Park Rangers. 

Tiote is understood to be interested in a move from St James' Park but, so far Lokomotiv have only offered £4m and Newcastle hope they will be put off by the valuation.

Diarra, 29, is keen to re-join Harry Redknapp at QPR but his wages are an issue. 

QPR have completed the signing of Leroy Fer from Norwich who in turn have signed striker Cameron Jerome from Stoke City for £2m and free agent defender Carlos Cuellar.
