The world’s first robotic ball takes the games of catch and marbles to a whole new level. 

Controlled by a smartphone app, Sphero can be programmed to weave in between objects, follow augmented reality race tracks and even keep a pet entertained. 

The 2.8-inch (73mm) ball travels up to 5mph (0.6 km/h), is fully waterproof and costs $99.99 in the U.S, and £99.99 in the UK.

It weighs 178g (0.4lbs) and comes in a variety of colours, including green and orange.

It can also be made to resemble a tennis ball or miniature basketball.

There are up to 30 games available via apps including driving, sports and arcade games.

It can even jump over ramps and complete obstacle courses by responding to direct commands from the user.

There are up to 30 games available via apps including driving, sports and arcade games, and the polycarbonate ball could soon be on its way to school classrooms to give children an insight into robotics.

It is hoped the waterproof ball will inspire a future generation to get involved in computer science and design and technology.

Software engineer Ian Bernstein, 30, from New Mexico owns robotic company Orbotix with his business partner Adam Wilson, 30

Bernstein said: ‘Adam and I both love robots and gaming.

‘When we started at Orbotix we wanted to create a physical object that was controlled by a smartphone or tablet.

‘We were inspired when I said ‘we need something simple that you can pull out of your pocket, throw it on the table, and it would do something cool’.

The Sphero is charged using a wireless charger, connected to the ball via Bluetooth. A basic version, that comes with fewer games, costs $79.99 in the U.S and £79.99 in the UK and has a range of 50 feet (15.24 metres). The colourful Nubby covers (pictured) cost $14.99 (£14.99) each

‘Adam replied by saying ‘what about a marble?’ and from that Sphero was born.

‘I like that Sphero is such a blank slate. There are so many things you can do with it and it has sparked a lot of creativity in our customers.

‘At a higher level you charge Sphero on a wireless charger and connect to it over Bluetooth on your smartphone or tablet, just like you would connect to a bluetooth speaker.

‘From there you can use the Sphero driving app to move Sphero around, change his colour. There are limitless options for the uses.’

The original Sphero comes with fewer games, costs $79.99 in the U.S and £79.99 in the UK, and has a range of 50 feet (15.24 metres.
