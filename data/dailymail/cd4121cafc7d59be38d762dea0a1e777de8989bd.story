Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has given goalkeeper Willy Caballero his Premier League debut since arriving in the summer from Malaga. 

England no.1 Joe Hart drops to the bench after a mixed start to the season and the Argentine shot stopper starts between the sticks against Hull City.  

Hart was at fault for Mame Biram Diouf's winner in the home defeat to Stoke in August.

Joe Hart drops to the champions' bench despite some strong performances earlier in the season 

But the 27-year-old was solid in last weekend's 1-1 draw against Chelsea and produced a superb performance in the narrow Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich. 

Earlier this season he claimed Manchester City do not have a no.1 goalkeeper and said that at some point Caballero would play 'two games in a row'.

Caballero played in the midweek Capital One Cup thrashing of Sheffield Wednesday and now he has his chance in the Premier League. 

But Hart is lined up to do Monday's press conference before the following day's Champions League clash with Roma, suggesting his stint out of the team will be short-lived.  

Pellegrini makes just one other change with Gael Clichy coming in for Aleksander Kolarov from their last Premier League outing against Chelsea
