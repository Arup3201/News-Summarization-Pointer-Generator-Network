Jailed: Adam Garthwaite has been sentenced to 12 months in a young offenders institution

An agriculture student has been sent to prison for killing a motorist after he lost control of his car because he was eating crisps.

Teenager Adam Garthwaite was driving home from college on country roads when his van veered off course and crashed head-on into an oncoming car.

The other driver, 38-year-old Paul Garcia, who lived with his wife and two young children in Launceston, Cornwall, died instantly in the crash.

Garthwaite, 19, terrified motorists in the minutes before the smash in March last year as he tailgated other cars and overtook at speed while driving near the border between Devon and Cornwall.

He later said he had no memory of how the crash happened, but police found a half-full bag of crisps in the car and suggested that he had not been paying attention to the road while he ate the snack.

The student sobbed uncontrollably throughout the hearing at Exeter Crown Court, which was attended by the victim's family as well as his own relatives.

Before the accident, he was a prize-winning young farmer who had won an award as Shepherd of the Year and already looked after his own flock.

Garthwaite, of Frithelstock in Devon, admitted causing death by careless driving and dangerous driving.

He was sentenced to 12 months in a young offenders institution and banned from driving for two years.

Judge Francis Gilbert told him: 'I accept you have been clearly affected by the consequences of this accident but I also have to consider the consequences for the deceased's widow and his two very young children, which are entirely predictable in the circumstances.

'This was a case of inattention. The positioning of your car on the wrong side of the road may not have been deliberate but it created a very obvious danger and had fatal consequences.

'You allowed your car to become a serious danger to others. I consider this case comes into a category of falling not far short of dangerous driving.'

Andrew MacFarlane, prosecuting, said Garthwaite was driving back from the Duchy College at Callington on the A388 and had a friend in the car with him.

The dangerous driving took place just before and inside St Giles-in-the-Heath, where he overtook two cars at such speed that one passenger called him a 'plonker' and a learner driver told her instructor that he would end up in hospital.

Police experts were baffled as to the cause of the crash until they examined the inside of his car.

Mr MacFarlane said: 'They found a quantity of crisps on the dashboard and the thought occurs that he may have been consuming them, although he denied that possibility.'

Jason Taylor, defending, said Garthwaite is so racked by guilt that he is now a broken shell of a man, accepts he deserves to be punished and has written a letter of apology to Mr Garcia's widow.

He said before the crash he ran his own farming business as well as studying at college and was a prominent Young Farmer, winning an award as Young Shepherd of the Year.

Mr Taylor said: 'The evidence in this case points to inattention, whether because he was talking to his passenger or because of the bag of crisps.'
