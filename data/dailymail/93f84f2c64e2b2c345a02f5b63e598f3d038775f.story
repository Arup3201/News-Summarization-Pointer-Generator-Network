Fresh from his red carpet appearance, Lewis Hamilton's dog Roscoe was also sharing in the limelight during the F1 world champion's Christmas celebrations.

The Mercedes driver posted an Instagram picture of himself and his pair of pooches - Roscoe and Coco - wearing identical Santa hats but very different facial expressions, with the caption: 'Hope you all had an amazing Christmas with your families! #GodIsTheGreatest #BestDogs #Family #GodBless #TeamLH #RoscoeAndCoco.

Roscoe had already been introduced to the world at large when he accompanied Hamilton to the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards to watch his master beat golf No 1 Rory McIlroy to the titular prize.
