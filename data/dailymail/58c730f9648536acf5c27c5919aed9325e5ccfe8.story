Her hair was perfect, her make-up expertly applied and her dress, beautiful. But for one model appearing in yesterday's Elie Saab show, walking appeared to be a little more problematic.

During her sashay down the runway, the unnamed model wobbled unsteadily before clattering to the floor.

But there was one silver lining: ignoring the beady stares of the watching fashion press, the model managed to keep her cool and got back up gracefully before completing her turn.

One of Paris' most popular designers, Saab always draws a crowd and yesterday's show proved no exception.

Watching from the front row was Russian actress and erstwhile Bond girl, Olga Kurylenko, who was ravishing in a vibrant emerald dress.

Also on hand to see the unfortunate model's struggles was the ever-elegant Clotilde Courau, a French actress and the princess of Venice and Piedmont, and Canadian actress, Marie-Josée Croze.

The show was part of Paris Couture Week, which started on Monday, and proved to be one of the highlights so far.

Lace proved the dominant theme with chic creations in lilac, coral, purple and cream all crafted from the material.

Among them was a spectacular wedding gown, complete with a skirt large enough to satisfy Elizabeth I or one of the stars of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, crafted from cream silk overlaid with delicate Chantilly lace.

Other stunning pieces created by the Lebanese designer included a delicate coral-red day dress, its calf-length full skirt embellished with intricate bead-work.
