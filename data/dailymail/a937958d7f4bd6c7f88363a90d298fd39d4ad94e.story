Angel di Maria has written an open letter to Real Madrid fans, claiming he never wanted to leave the Spanish giants.

The winger completed his £60million move to Manchester United on Tuesday, signing a five-year deal with the Old Trafford club.

But he insists he would rather have signed a new contract with the Champions League winners.

Forced? Di Maria claimed he did not want to leave Real Madrid in the farewell letter

In the letter, published by Spanish newspaper Marca, Di Maria said: ‘Unfortunately today I have to go, but I want to make clear that this was never my desire.

‘As anyone who works, I’ve always wanted to progress. After winning ‘La Decima’ I went to the World Cup with the hope of receiving a new contract, which never came.

‘Many things and many lies were spoken. They always wanted to attribute the initiative to me to leave the club, but I did not. The only thing I asked for is something that would be fair.

‘There are many things that I value and many of them have nothing to do with my salary. I hope to progress at Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, where I wish to make history.’

Di Maria has signed a five-year deal with United, just three months after inspiring Madrid to their 10th European Cup triumph against city rivals Atletico in Lisbon.

He added: ‘I’ve been lucky enough to share a dressing room with fantastic players, who have been even better companions.

‘I think that was the key to La Decima. I want to apologize for the times I was wrong, on or off the pitch. It was never my intention to harm anyone.

‘I sweated for this shirt in every game as if it was my last. There were times when things went for me and others not, but what I can say is that I always gave everything.’

Dear Madridismo,

My cycle at Real Madrid has come to an end. Is impossible to capture all I have lived through in a few lines, but I want this letter to communicate what I feel at the moment of parting. In these four years I had the honor to wear this shirt I feel nothing but pride for what I went through and achieved along with my team mates.

Unfortunately today I have to go, but I want to make clear that this was never my desire. As anyone who works, I’ve always wanted to progress. After winning “La Decima” I went to the World Cup with the hope of receiving a new contract, which never came. Many things and many lies were spoken. They always wanted to attribute the initiative to me to leave the club, but did not. The only thing I asked for is something that would be fair. There are many things that I value and many of them have nothing to do with my salary. I hope to progress at Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, where I wish to make history.

I’ve been lucky enough to share a dressing room with fantastic players, who have been even better companions. I think that was the key to La Decima. I want to apologize for the times I was wrong, on or off the pitch. It was never my intention to harm anyone. I sweated for this shirt in every game as if it was my last. There were times when things went for me and others not, but what I can say is that I always gave everything.

I want to thank Spain for everything you gave me and especially for allowing my daughter to be born on this earth. And to the very special people at Montepríncipe hospital, which I will always carry in my heart. My wife, daughter and I will be forever grateful. Also to my colleagues who gave me their support always, in good times and bad, to the various technical bodies that I got to work with and also to all the people who work every day at the club, with which I hope to keep a great relationship.

I hope that Real Madrid have a great season and get this club the achievements they are always looking for. I take forever in my memory that time in the Supercopa when I jumped at the Bernabeu and I received from the fans immense affection. Thank you. I have goose bumps yet cannot think of a better farewell for which unfortunately was my last game.

Hala Madrid! And until forever!
