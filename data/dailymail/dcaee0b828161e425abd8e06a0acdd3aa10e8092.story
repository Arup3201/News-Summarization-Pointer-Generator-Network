DNA testing by the FBI has cleared Jesse Matthew of any connection to the abduction and murder of Alexis Murphy, the 17-year-old Virginia girl who went missing in 2013 and has never been found.

Matthew, 32, has separately been charged with the murder of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, 18, who went missing from a bar in Charlottesvile last September and whose body was found a month later following an extensive search.

Matthew has pleaded not guilty to killing Graham.

Following Mathew's arrest in October, the attorney for Randy Allen Taylor - the man convicted of Murphy's murder - requested that Matthew be properly examined as a possible suspect in the teen's death.

According to News Advance, swabs of DNA taken from the driver’s side head rest and the steering wheel of Murphy’s Nissan Maxima did not match Matthew, Nelson Commonwealth’s Attorney Anthony Martin said in a news release Friday.

In July last year, Randy Allen Taylor was convicted of abducting and killing Murphy and sentenced to two life terms.

'At no time did the name Jesse Matthew ever come up by Randy Taylor or Mr. Hallahan until Matthew’s arrest in the Hannah Graham case in October 2014,' Martin said in the release. 

Despite Murphy's body never being found, there was overwhelming physical evidence that tied Taylor to her murder.

Investigators found a t-shirt under a sofa in Taylor's camper that was splattered with Murphy's blood, as well as the girls shattered cellphone in brush outside the camper.

A finger fragment, long black hair and a diamond stud - all with Murphy's DNA - were also found in the camper.

Despite being cleared in the Murphy case, Matthew is also charged in the sexual assault of a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax, Va., in 2005, according to The New York Daily News.

The victim has not been named.

Mathew has pleaded not guilty to attempted capital murder, rape and sexual assault in that case.

Additional DNA information has also linked Matthew to the disappearance of Morgan Harrington, a 19-year-old Virginia Tech student, who vanished after attending a concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. 

Her body was found a few months later.

As news Graham's disappearance hit the headlines earlier this year, reports emerged that the suspect had been accused of sexual assault multiple times in the past 12 years. 

He first came to police attention when the first sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus.

The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped.

His last day at the school was the day the accusation was made, the Washington Post reported.

Matthew then attended Christopher Newport University, where he was accused of another sexual assault on September 7, 2003.

Discovery: Graham's remains were found in a shallow grave in this abandoned property in mid-October

Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school. 

It is not yet clear how this second incident was resolved.

In November, Matthew made his first court appearance in the 2005 case via videolink in Charlottesville. Earlier this week, he was transferred to Fairfax Jail ahead of his in-person appearance.

He will now be returned to Charlottesville for a preliminary hearing on December 5 in relation to the alleged abduction of Miss Graham with the intent to defile. He is not yet facing murder charges.

At the time, Albemarle County Sheriff Chip Harding said Miss Graham's death could have been avoided if Virginia would collect DNA for misdemeanor convictions as well as felonies.

Mr Harding said that had authorities collected DNA from Matthew following a 2010 misdemeanor trespassing conviction, it would have generated a hit that would have linked him to the Fairfax case and the Harrington case years before Graham was killed.

On Friday, Mr Morrogh said he agreed about the benefits of expanding DNA collection, describing DNA as 'no different than a fingerprint' and saying: 'We're talking about saving lives here.

Lat month, Matthew's attorney, James Camblos, said he had reason to question his client's sanity and requested a psychiatric evaluation. A judge is yet to reject or permit his request.

The sexual assault and abduction cases are ongoing.
