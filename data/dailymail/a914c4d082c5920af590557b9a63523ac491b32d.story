Former Brazil international Roberto Dinamite, who was president of Vasco da Gama when the club sold Philippe Coutinho to Inter Milan, believes the Liverpool playmaker will wear the Brazil number 10 shirt for years to come.

Dinamite was head of Vasco when they reluctantly packed the teenager off to Europe in 2010.

Dinamite said: 'He already stood out when he left Vasco. And he is fulfilling his potential at Liverpool. He has that Brazilian talent, honed and developed in Europe, and he will keep getting better.

Coutinho has scored a number of key goals for Liverpool this season, including against Manchester City

'He came to us aged 14 and it is a shame we only had him for a short time but the offers for him came very soon. Brazil need players who play the way he does with the close control and passing that he displays.'

Coutinho was overlooked by Luiz Felipe Scolari ahead of last summer's World Cup but it seems new coach Dunga wants to build his team around his partnership with Neymar.  

The 22-year-old has been in excellent form for Liverpool this season, scoring a number of crucial goals to help them in their pursuit of the top four.
