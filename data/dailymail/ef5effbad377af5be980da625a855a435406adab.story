Independence could leave Scots facing higher mobile phone bills if they use their phone south of the border, the UK Government will claim.

Ministers are to publish the latest in a series of papers examining the impact of a Yes vote in next year's independence referendum.

The paper will suggest independence could impact on mail services and costs, and could make programmes to roll out high speed broadband across the country more expensive.

Scots may also have to pay international roaming charges if they make a mobile phone call south of the border

People close to the border could also incur extra charges if their mobile phone is connected to a mast on the other side of the border

It says mobile phone users may have to pay international roaming charges if they make a call in England, Wales or Northern Ireland.

It also warns that people close to the border could inadvertently incur these charges if their mobile phone connected to a mast on the other side of the border.

UK Consumer Minister Jo Swinson said: 
'The UK's integrated infrastructure connects people and communities, 
creates jobs and supports trade.

'The Government is committed to 
maintaining world class postal and broadband services.

'This includes 
continuation of a six-day-a-week postal delivery service and the 
provision of broadband to rural areas.

'The rural broadband programme 
will deliver investment of £100.8million to Scottish communities that 
depend on getting connected.

'If Scotland left the UK, posting a letter or making a call could cost more - and there could be less choice for customers.'

The UK Government believes that by being in Britain Scotland benefits from 'world class services and economies of scale' that support the postal service, with its uniform pricing all over the UK, and investment in broadband.

The Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition has allocated £530million over the spending review period for its rural broadband programme, designed to help roll out high speed internet services to more remote communities.

Scotland is to receive just over £100million of this, with the UK Government saying the country 'benefits disproportionately' compared to its share of the population.

But it warns that independence would mean Scotland would no longer benefit from this, adding this would 'inevitably' drive up the cost of delivering broadband in such areas.

The UK Government also argues that if Scotland left the UK it could impact on the cost of sending letters and parcels between the two countries.

At the moment, it says economies of scale across Britain help support six day a week postal deliveries, with customers paying one price to post something, regardless of where they are.

The cost of posting letters and parcels could rise in an independent Scotland, the Government has warned

Communities Minister Jo Swinson said there may be less choice for consumers in an independent Scotland

This is part of the Royal Mail's universal service, with the UK Government saying the supporters of independence should set out if these levels of service would be maintained following a Yes vote.

The Scottish Government said successive Westminster governments had 'substantially weakened' Scotland's communications infrastructure.

A spokeswoman said: 'Since 2002, more than 400 Scottish Post Offices have closed and plans for privatisation of Royal Mail threatens jobs and the operation of the universal service obligation whilst people across rural Scotland regularly struggle with the lack of mobile phone coverage as the current system fails to deliver for Scotland.

'Independence will provide an opportunity to properly support the postal network with access to our fair share of UK assets, and as the Federation of Post Masters have recognised, the Scottish Government has an excellent record of supporting rural post offices.

'Both the Royal Mail and the Federation of Post Masters are clear that there need be no disruption to services and that independence could offer real opportunities for the network.

'Similarly the UK's claims fail to recognise key changes in the telecoms market. Currently, the fragmentation of mobile and broadband initiatives, and the reserved nature of telecoms policy and regulation, prevents us from realising the economic benefits that could be achieved through improving digital connectivity - something highlighted in our proposals for future regulation published in February.

'However the UK Government should acknowledge that the EU is looking to remove roaming charges completely and they are widely expected to be abolished well before 2016.

'Independence could ensure that the regulatory and policy regimes are better aligned to achieve this.'
