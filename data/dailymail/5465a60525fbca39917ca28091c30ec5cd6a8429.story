Hundreds of swans glide through the waters at Abbotsbury Swannery, the only managed colony of nesting swans anywhere in the world.

Volunteers gathered at the attraction near Chesil Beach in Dorset yesterday to count the the graceful but powerful birds, which gather there every year to nest and breed.

They use kayaks to herd the swans towards vets, who weigh and measure the birds before giving them inoculations and releasing them back into the wild.

Hard work: Volunteers carry the swans and cygnets away for their health checks and inoculations

I'm outta here: But most of the birds are moulting in July, so are unable to simply fly away like this one

This way please: It is unclear whether the birds respond to hand signals...

A colony of the birds has lived at Abbotsbury sanctuary since medieval times; keeping track of their numbers is a longstanding tradition.

Between 600 and 1,000 of Britain's native flying swans - known as Cygnus olor in Latin - breed, nest and hatch there every year.

They provide feathers for the helmets of the Gentlemen at Arms, the Queen's bodyguard.

Lloyds of London also use quills from Abbotsbury swan feathers to register insurance losses in their 'Doom' book.

Traditionally, the hatching of the first cygnet of the year at Abbotsbury marks the beginning of summer.

Unlike most British swans, these are not owned by the Queen. They were sold by Henry VIII to the Earls of Abbotsbury after he destroyed Britain's monasteries in the 16th Century.

John Houston, general manager of Abbotsbury Tourism, told the BBC: 'In July the birds are moulting so they don't fly, so we use kayaks to herd them.

'People who come to visit early that morning will see the swans being herded.'
