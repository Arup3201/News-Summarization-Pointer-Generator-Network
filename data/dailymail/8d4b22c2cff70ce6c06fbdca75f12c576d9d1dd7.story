Jill Tarlov, 59, was left brain-dead after being struck by a cyclist in Central Park

The wife of a CBS executive was left brain-dead after being struck by a man on a bicycle in Manhattan's Central Park Thursday afternoon.

Jill Tarlov, 59, from Fairfield, Connecticut, was rushed to New York Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in critical condition following the collision that took place at around 4.30pm in a crosswalk near 63rd Street.

According to police, the wife of CBS senior vice president Michael Wittman was out shopping for a birthday present for their daughter when 31-year-old Jason Marshall slammed into Tarlov while biking at high speed.

The New York Post
 reported that Marshall, a professional musician, yelled at the 
pedestrian to get out of the way while furiously pedaling his expensive 
Jamis Eclipse bike in the car lane.

Following
 the crash, the 31-year-old man remained at the scene until police 
arrived. 

He reportedly admitted that he was in the wrong traffic lane at
 the time of the accident, according to The Post.

The prosecutor's office will now examine the evidence in the case to decide whether or not to charge Marshall with a crime.

Phillip Fenton, 21, a visitor from the UK who allegedly witnessed the accident, told the paper that it did not look as if Marshall even tried to stop before he rammed into Jill Tarlov.

He yelled at the woman 'get out of the way!' but it is possible the 59-year-old failed to hear him.

Another witness, Tom Longman, described the moment the high-performance yellow bike made contact with the unsuspecting pedestrian, knocking her off her feet. 

'The right side of her face looked really bad,' he told The Post. 'There was blood all over her.'

The 59-year-old victim was rushed to the hospital, where she was reportedly pronounced brain dead but remained on a ventilator.

'She was my wife. She was the best,' the woman's devastated husband told the New York Daily News. 'She was walking in Central Park. We don't know if she had the light or he did....she was in the crosswalk,'

According to a New York Times wedding announcement, Tarlov and Wittman got married in April 1986.

At the time, Tarlov worked as a media consultant while her bridegroom was the controller for WINS-AM radio. He was hired by CBS Television Stations in 1996, rising through the ranks to the position of senior vice president and controller in 2010.

The couple have two college-age children, son Matthew and daughter Anna.

According to his Facebook page, Jason Marshall, a native of Maryland, is a professional saxophone player who graduated from Aaron Copland School of Music and Queens College.

Abraham H. Foxman, National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, said: 'Everyone here is devastated by the news about our good friend and colleague, Jillian Tarlov. 

'Jillian was a warm, engaging, and deeply caring person, a terrific colleague and a good friend to many people on our staff. 

'Our thoughts and prayers are with her husband and family at this difficult time.'

Jill was most recently Director of Internet Marketing Initiatives at ADL, and she previously worked as a project director in our Education Division. 

She worked there from May 2008 through September 2011.
