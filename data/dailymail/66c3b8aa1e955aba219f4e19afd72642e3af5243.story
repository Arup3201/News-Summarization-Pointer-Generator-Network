Condemned: John Cherry, a former Conservative councillor for Chichester District Council

The Tory councillor at the centre of a race row is being investigated by police over provocative comments he made to The Mail on Sunday about black and Asian children.

John Cherry, left, was forced to resign from the Tory Party after suggesting inner-city children from a ‘coloured area’ would not be welcome at a proposed new boarding school in the countryside.

In a report in last week’s Mail on Sunday, the West Sussex district and county councillor said the youngsters could ‘escape into the forest’ and trigger a ‘sexual volcano’ because they had been ‘plucked from their natural surroundings’.

Sussex Police have launched a probe to establish whether the comments amount to a racist offence.

A spokesman said: ‘The remarks attributed to Mr Cherry have been subject of complaints to us by two members of the public.’

Plans: Former boarding school St Cuthman's School in Sussex which has been bought by the Durand Academy in Stockwell

Top-performing Durand Academy in 
Stockwell, near Brixton, South London, wants to open the school in the 
West Sussex village of Stedham, transporting 600 youngsters to the site 
every Monday morning and returning them to London on Friday.

Mr Cherry, 73, later apologised for 
his comments, saying: ‘My remarks  were thoughtless and extremely 
foolish. I very much regret the distress this must have caused.’

Shock: Durand Academy chief Greg Martin has described the attitude of residents as 'shocking' but has vowed to press on with the scheme
