Part of downtown Madrid was shut off for more than three hours  after a ruined businessman drove a car feared to be packed with explosives into the main entrance of the headquarters of Spain's ruling right wing Popular Party.

Daniel Perez Berlanga, 37, told police who arrested him that he had 'lost everything' because of the government's austerity policies over the past four years. 

He warned that his vehicle, which he drove into the building on Genova Street, was packed with 15 kilos of explosives 'timed to go off within 45 minutes'.

Daniel Perez Berlanga, 37, drove a car feared to be packed with explosives into the main entrance of the headquarters of Spain's ruling right wing Popular Party

The driver told police who arrested him that he had 'lost everything' because of the government's austerity policies over the past four years

Police closed the street, which is one of Madrid's busiest, immediately after the incident at 7am just as the morning rush hour was beginning, causing a massive traffic jam.

Three underground stations were closed and one line partially shut down, holding up thousands of people on their way to work. 

Buildings near the party HQ, many of them private apartments, were evacuated.

A robot was used to examine the smashed Citroen Xantia in the foyer of the party building as fire engines, ambulances and police vehicles lined the otherwise empty street some distance away. 

The car contained camping gas canisters and sacks of industrial fertilizer which can be used in making explosives.

No one was injured during the incident, but the danger of a blast was not ruled out until nearly three hours after it began.

Police have been keeping guard outside the building for several years, mainly to prevent demonstrators protesting corruption scandals affecting the party or the government's handling of the severe economic crisis from getting near the office.

Spain has the second-highest unemployment rate in Europe after Greece and nearly half of the 5.4 million jobless have been out of work for more than two years, meaning they can no longer claim benefits.
