One of the country's most popular Christmas toys is selling online for more than twice its original price as parents scramble to get their hands on the must-have present.

The LeapFrog LeapPad, a child's 'educational computer' which normally costs £79.99, is being sold on eBay and Amazon for over £170 as stocks run low nationwide.

Numbers of the toy are running low after a sudden rush of sales saw it become September's best-selling toy in terms of value.

In demand: The LeapFrog LeapPad toy is set to be one of the biggest sellers this year and has doubled in price online

Its rival - the VTech InnoTab - is also seeing soaring sales.

Adam Christopher, from toy price comparison website kidstoptoys.co.uk, said: 'Most retailers have been sticking to the recommended retail price for the LeapPad and InnoTab now, with the exception of Amazon and Tesco.

'Tesco has been selling the InnoTab for £63.99, which has been one of the cheapest prices.

'It's on sites like eBay, the Amazon sellers market and the Play.com sellers market where we have seen prices topping £150. I guess it happens every year with certain toys.' 

The LeapPad, a learning tablet for kids, features a built-in camera, video recorder, reading apps and hundreds of games, is flying off the shelves in toy shops.

It is selling on eBay's highest 'Buy It Now' offer for £175 while on Amazon the toy is available for a minimum of £127.99 and a maximum of £169.99.

Some traders are even buying Argos reservation numbers to sell on eBay.

Asking price: This advert on eBay advertised the LeapPad Explorer with a Toy Story game and carry case for a whopping £199.99

The LeapPad's rival, the VTech InnoTab - is also seeing soaring sales but costs upwards of its normal £63 asking price

The popularity of the LeapPad has increased since it was named in the Toy Retailers Association's 'Dream Dozen' gadgets for Christmas.

It has been a sell-out success and has usurped Lego's Minifigures to become September's most valuable toy.

Retailers have been altering prices of the LeapPad, as well as the InnoTab, to take advantage of the short supply.

Others have been limiting customers to one purchase to combat the listings on eBay and Amazon.

Robert
Dekker, senior marketing director at LeapFrog, said the company would 
be replenishing supplies at various points to be divided equally between
retailers.

He said: 'Ultimately, everybody should be able to get hold of a LeapPad, perhaps just not in time for Christmas.

'We
administer the recommended retail price to all retailers, however, the 
prices chosen by individual stockists are beyond our control.'
