A film about the life of Paul Gascoigne which could be called 'Gazza - British Raging Bull' is reportedly close to being announced.

An Oscar-nominated production team are said to have lined up a movie about the ups and downs of the England legend, including his playing days and his battle with alcohol.

Gascoigne is understood to want actor Sean Bean to play him and the film is already at the 'planning stage', according to sources.

'An initial contract has been signed. We're working with a well-respected production company who have been nominated for an Oscar in the past,' a source told the Daily Star.

'Paul has had an incredible life and we know they'll do it justice on screen. He's very excited.' 

The newspaper reported that 55-year-old Bean may be ruled out of playing the lead role due to his age. Other suggestions are Danny Dyer and Jack O'Connell.

The former Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur player won 57 caps for England, before retiring in 2004. 

Gascoigne has recently been on the mend following a three-day emergency detox in October.

He told The Sun: 'I was doing well, but every day was like Groundhog Day - doing the same thing - and I started drinking again. 

'I was going to the gym, going shopping then going home. I just had a little blip. I messed up. But when that happens to me the whole world sees it.'

Sportsmail contacted Gascoigne's representatives for comment on Saturday morning.
