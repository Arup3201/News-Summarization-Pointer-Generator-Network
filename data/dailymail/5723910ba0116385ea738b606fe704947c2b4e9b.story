The decorated Boston police officer who was shot in the face during a routine traffic stop has been upgraded to a stable condition following successful surgery to remove the bullet from his neck.

Officer John Moynihan, 34, was placed in a medically-induced coma and listed in a critical condition after being shot below his right eye at point blank range in Boston, Massachusetts, on Friday night.

The suspect, Angelo West, 41, was  gunned down  by other cops in the city's Roxbury area. He was declared dead at the scene, while a female bystander is recovering from a bullet wound to the arm.

Now, Moynihan has been upgraded to a 'stable and improving condition' after undergoing several hours of surgery to remove the bullet that lodged behind his right ear during the 'unprovoked' attack.

He is expected to be moved out of Boston Medical Center's Intensive Care Unit in 'coming days', Boston Police Department said in a statement on Sunday, in which it praised medics' efforts.

'I’m thankful to the doctors and medical team at Boston Medical Center for taking such good care of my officer,' Commissioner William Evans said in the document, posted on the force's website.

'I was happy to hear that he made it through surgery without any complications, it shows you what a strong kid he is and what a great medical team they have here at Boston Medical Center.' 

On Sunday morning, the police department, alongside other officials and members of the community, held a special service to pray for Moynihan and his family at Saint Patrick's Church in Roxbury. 

'He's a fighter, he's going to pull through,' Evans said at a press conference on Boston on Saturday.

Moynihan was attacked by West after he approached the driver's door of a car that he and five other gang task force members had pulled over following reports of shots fired in the area, police said.

West, traveling with two others, allegedly shot the officer in the face at point-blank range without warning. He then started shooting at other cops, but was killed when they returned fire, it is said.

Emergency response: Moynihan was attacked by West after he approached the driver's door of a car that he and five other gang task force members had pulled over following reports of shots fired in the area, it is said

During the attack, the suspect, from Hyde Park, reportedly fired so many bullets that he emptied his revolver, according to the Boston Globe. He was later revealed to have had a violent criminal past. 

None of the officers with the Youth Violence Task Force, including Moynihan, had drawn their guns when West opened fire, Suffolk DA Dan Conley said at the press conference on Saturday. 

The woman at the scene who suffered a flesh wound to her right arm was said to be in good spirits on Saturday, while three other officers were taken to a hospital with stress-related problems. 

Following the shootout,  Moynihan was forced to undergo tests to check for bleeding in his brain, Evans said. 'We are hoping and praying there's not further damage,' he said on Saturday. 

He added that the officers had been watching the vehicle before pulling it over. Police are now interviewing the other two people in the car. It is unknown whether criminal charges will be filed.

Thankful: 'I’m thankful to the doctors and medical team at Boston Medical Center for taking such good care of my officer,' Commissioner William Evans (pictured demonstrating the suspect's hand movements) said

Police: Evans added: 'I was happy to hear that he made it through surgery without any complications, it shows you what a strong kid he is and what a great medical team they have here at Boston Medical Center' 

Officers conferred in Roxbury after Humboldt Avenue was shut down following a shooting on Friday evening

Moynihan is a highly decorated military veteran who was awarded a medal for bravery by President Barack Obama last May for his involvement in a shoot-out with the Boston Bombing suspects.

He had helped to save transit officer Richard Donohue Jr,  during the gunfight with Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, which occurred just days after the marathon bombings that killed three.

He and other officers pressed against Donohue's chest and forced air into his lungs after he started losing bloody rapidly on the Watertown Street, ultimately saving his life, CNN reported. 

Moynihan, an Iraq veteran, won the Boston Police Department's Medal of Honor in 2014.

Local prosecutors will now investigate Friday's shooting to ensure that Moynihan followed departmental procedures during the attack, said Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Connolly.

'It's going to be completely transparent,' Connolly said of the review, which he added would be shared with West's family and lawyers once it is complete.

Over the past year the United States has seen waves of sometimes violent protests after unarmed black men were killed by white police officers, including in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York.

Evans alluded to those concerns, but stressed that West set off Friday's gunfight. 'It was a really violent confrontation that was clearly unprovoked by our officers,' the commissioner said.

Such shootings are rare in Boston, but firearms are a major concern in the city, Evans added.

'We've got way too many guns out there, way too many young kids running around with the guns,' he said. 'Unfortunately, this is what happens.'

Mayor Marty Walsh said his thoughts and prayers were with Moynihan, his family and other police officers in the department, saying: 'These acts of violence have no place in our neighborhoods.'

He added: 'Our community is stronger than ever, and tonight we are thankful for all of those who put their lives on the on the line every day to protect our city.'

An investigation is ongoing.
