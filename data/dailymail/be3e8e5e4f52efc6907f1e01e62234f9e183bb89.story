Many women would give anything for a larger bust. But Tina Williams has a warning for them: big breasts come with their own problems.

'I've always been shapely,' says Tina, a 62-year-old retired civil servant from Sheffield. 'It runs in the family. Even when I was at my slimmest I was a D cup.

'They never used to cause me problems, but about 20 years ago I noticed a red rash under my chest. It could be extremely sore and sometimes it would bleed. At night I'd want to hold my bust up because it was so painful.'

Fuller figure: Tina Williams suffered from intertrigo, a a fungal, bacterial or viral infection of broken skin

Tina was suffering with intertrigo, a condition that many women with large or sagging breasts have - yet it's rarely  spoken about.

The problem starts when the skin under the breasts rubs against them, causing irritation. Because the area is warm and moist, it is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria or yeast which are found naturally on the skin. These multiply, causing the rash to become infected.

The symptoms can be extremely painful - and embarrassing, too, as the unsightly infection has an unpleasant odour.

'The smell was the worst thing, and no amount of showering or using cream seemed to get rid of it,' says Tina, who lives with her husband David, 66, a retired local government officer. 'I used a lot of perfume.

'Initially I tried to keep the area dry with talcum powder but soon realised I needed something more. I saw my GP, and he said it was a fungus. I felt dirty, even though I showered every day.

'It was like it was my fault, and at the time I thought I was probably the only one with it, as it's not really something you talk about.'

Her doctor prescribed an anti-fungal cream containing steroids, which helped, but didn't clear the rash completely.

'The intertrigo would still flare up about half a dozen times a year - particularly during the hot summers,' she says. 'Looking back, I think it worsened when work was stressful, too.

'I also found the wire from underwired bras would really dig in and aggravate the whole thing.'

Intertrigo is a fungal, bacterial or viral infection of broken skin. As well as large-chested women, it is a common problem among overweight or obese people, and can occur in other parts of the body such as the folds of the skin around the groin or buttocks, armpits, and even behind the ears.

Envy: Many women desire larger busts, but they come with their own problems

One Dutch study found one in 20 hospital patients and as many as 17 per cent of people in nursing homes were suffering with it.

'Intertrigo becomes more common as cupsizes go up, but it's more to do with the shape of the breasts than the size - even someone with small breasts could suffer intertrigo if they sagged and rubbed the skin,' says Dr Graham Johnston, a consultant dermatologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary.

'It's especially common as ladies get older and after they've had children. The breasts sag, and the skin thins with age, too, which means it's more sensitive. A badly fitting bra can cause the skin to chafe. The skin gets red and itchy because of all the sweatiness and chafing.

'But it's the growth of infection that causes real problems - this is from the normal bugs or yeast we have on our skin.'

Diabetes - a known risk for people who are overweight - can further complicate intertrigo. 'Diabetes makes the skin more prone to infection because high blood sugar levels can weaken the immune system.

'This problem gets significantly greater the bigger you get.

'Some large ladies, if they fail to lose weight, get into a vicious cycle of troublesome intertrigo that will never go away.'

Stress, which is known to exacerbate many skin conditions, can make it worse, adds Dr Anthony Bewley, consultant dermatologist at Barts Health NHS Trust in London.

'It can be very distressing. There's almost always a problem with people not coming forward due to embarrassment, because of the areas of the body that it concerns - and especially if it's smelly.'

Caroline Morrice, 48, has had intertrigo for 20 years, but never went to her doctor out of embarrassment and because she felt nothing could be done about it.

'It's not something that's always there, but it's definitely worse in hot weather. I have the rash under my breasts and around the groin area,' says Caroline, who is chief executive of the charity Guillain-Barre Syndrome Support Group.

'I wear well-fitting underwear and shower frequently, and use Sudocrem on it which helps (the cream, designed for nappy rash, contains antifungal and antibacterial agents).

'But I thought it was something I had to put up with because I'm a bit overweight, so never thought of seeing a doctor.'

Good personal hygiene is key to preventing infection, explains Dr Johnston - unfortunately, while many people may be scrupulous about cleanliness, they are unwittingly doing the wrong thing.

'It's important to make sure the area remains clean and dry. I suspect a lot of ladies think they should be scrubbing and using creams on it, but ironically harsh soaps and cleaners can make it worse because they take away layers of skin, meaning the soap particles get trapped there and cause greater infection. So we recommend or prescribe a soap substitute such as an emollient.'

Aqueous cream is a good soap substitute and should always be rinsed off, although if it stings during washing, ask your chemist for another soap substitute.

'Your second line of attack will be anti-fungal creams which can be bought over the counter, or if it's really sore your GP might want to prescribe an anti-fungal with a bit of steroid in it to allow the skin to heal,' says Dr Johnston.

In the most severe cases, the skin can break and bleed, and those patients may need antibiotics.

Anyone suffering with this rash should consider seeing their doctor, because it may turn out not to be intertrigo, says Dr Johnston.

'Intertrigo can look almost identical to psoriasis which typically causes large, red, scaly patches on the skin - intertrigo is particularly close to flexural psoriasis which targets the folds of the skin under the breasts and buttocks. We do see patients who've been referred to us with intertrigo, but turn out to have psoriasis.

'The key is to look at whether they have the rash elsewhere on the body, such as the nails and scalp - that would suggest psoriasis.

'If you are small-chested but have a rash under your breasts it's more likely to be something like psoriasis or an allergy.'

Irritation: A badly fitting bra could cause the skin to chafe, making the skin more prone to infection

Tina Williams thinks her intertrigo may have been triggered when she gained weight because of an overactive thyroid - she had an operation for this but, to her distress, continued to put on weight, gaining 3st.

Tina, who is 5ft 5in and a size 18-20, has recently started on the two-day fast diet (where you eat 500 calories for two days, and then healthily for the rest of the week) and is starting to shed pounds.

After suffering for 20 years, Tina even considered breast reduction surgery, but decided against it after realising how serious the operation is.

Then, in March, she stumbled upon a solution when her husband noticed a newspaper article about Optifit, a new bra aimed at bigger-busted women. The bra hugs the body from the back, so the breasts are better lifted away from the body compared to regular bras. 

'I never thought it would help with the intertrigo, but within a few weeks of wearing the bra, I noticed the rash was clearing up,' says Tina. 'Instead of having to use the steroid cream every day, I only needed it every other day.'

Because her breasts were lifted, they were no longer rubbing against the skin beneath them, allowing the intertrigo to heal.

'The rash has gone completely now - I don't need the cream at all. I'm so relieved to be free of it at last.'
