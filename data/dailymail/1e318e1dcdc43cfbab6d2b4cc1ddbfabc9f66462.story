Food buffs will tell you that poached salmon and black truffles is lost without a chilled French chablis.

But would they have a clue if you asked them which wine was best paired with a Big Mac and large fries?

Motivated by the idea that every meal can be special, a team of experts has developed a guide that matches some of the nation’s favourite snacks and takeaway meals with their perfect wine.

Experts say the perfect wine can be found for any meal, including takeaways

The researchers promise to make every
 meal ‘a memorable experience’ by listing the best wine to go with 
anything from a fish finger sandwich to Marmite on toast. 

Tesco surveyed 20,000 people to find 14 of our favourite meals and match them with wines.

For
 example, the experts said Scotch eggs should be teamed with a Swartland
 chenin blanc, whose ‘round peachy texture works beautifully with the 
soft texture and rich flavour of the egg’.

A
 McDonalds Big Mac meal is best accompanied by a zinfandel because its 
‘plummy sweet fruit characters pair well with the sweet flavours’ of the
 chips and burger.

After-dinner favourites haven’t been 
forgotten, with the guide saying that Ben & Jerry’s Phish ice cream 
should be matched with Yellow Tail shiraz or a dessert semillon.

Laura Jewell, one of only 301 Masters of Wine worldwide, said the project was aimed at demystifying the process of choosing good wine.

Experts chose a rose for KFC and chablis or sauvignon blanc to complement fish and chips

She said: ‘There is a lot of 
stuffiness when it comes to food and wine matching and we are well aware
 that the majority of the advice given does not correspond with what 
people are actually eating on a daily basis.’

She added that the project was inspired by customers ‘becoming much more adventurous and international’ in their tastes.

Also on her team was Davy Zyw, who developed his skills as a sommelier at top London restaurant Le Gavroche before joining Tesco.

He said: ‘Finding interesting wine matches to dishes is great fun.

‘Just as you would add a squeeze of lemon to your fish, so too should wine be considered an accompaniment. Wine can turn a simple dish into a memorable experience.’
