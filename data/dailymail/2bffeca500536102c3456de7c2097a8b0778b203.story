Proposals for more Mandarin to be taught in schools across Australia has been hailed as 'brilliant news'.

The South Australian government is considering an English-Mandarin bi-lingual program that could start in early 2016 to help strengthen cultural and economic links with China.

A working group is looking at the benefits of establishing a bilingual school, the programme would start from primary school age to Year 12 students.

Julie Hayes, principal Cowandilla Primary School in Adelaide told Daily Mail Australia, she thought it was a 'fine idea' if the school did not already teach a language.

'It would help us understand the Chinese people more because language carries culture and encapsulates how people view the world. 

'It would help us understand the Chinese perspective, values, family and religion. 

'It is important and whatever language you end up studying it gives you an insight into the world of those people. 

'We have 67 per cent of our children who are non English speaking at this school, it is a real mix of everything. 

'We already teach three languages at this school, it's historically an area of Greek and Italian descent so we teach those and also aboriginal language Pitjantjara. 

'We would not take on any new languages because we do enough already and because they have historic connections to us they are far more important.'  

Children learning Mandarin in a bilingual school will make it easier for them to take in the language, say experts

The South Australian bilingual schools working group will be tasked with researching possible funding models for bilingual programs, identifying a school willing to transform its curriculum to that of a bilingual school and working with the school to develop an appropriate curriculum. 

Angela Scarino, associate professor of Applied Linguistics at the University of South Australia told Daily Mail Australia there was 'bucket loads of evidence' to show that being bilingual improves kids learning across the curriculum.

She said: 'This is brilliant news for South Australia. It's fantastic in relation to language learning because it is the most robust way to of ensuring the children learn the language. 

SA Premier Jay Weatherill wants more children to learn Mandarin at school 

'Chinese is wonderful language given the place of China in the world. 

'Because Chinese is a more distant language for Australian learners it is important that children have a good amount of time on task to learn the language. 

'With the bilingual approach the students have more exposure to the language.'  

South Australia Premier Jay Weatherill says increased proficiency in Mandarin will help South Australia enhance its engagement with China.

'Language is an important carrier of culture and this proposal will help strengthen our already strong relationship with China. 

'In the early years of primary school, I envisage that lessons might be conducted in Mandarin on three or four days per week, before the balance is adjusted as the students grow in confidence in both languages.

'I understand that English-speaking students need to engage in around 2,800 hours of intense, focused study to become proficient in Mandarin - this is only possible in an immersion environment.

'Our relationship with China must be more than transactional.

''My government is keen to strengthen the cultural aspects of our relationship with its economic partners, so these relationships can grow in the long term.' 

Education Minister Jennifer Rankine is currently in China to promote Chinese schools adopting the SACE, so more international students may chose Adelaide as a preferred study destination.  

Chad Sexton-Finck, principal of Redcliffe Primary School in WA  called the new initiative 'terrific'

Mandy Scott, secretary for the Association of Learning Mandarin in Australia told Daily Mail Australia: 'I think this is the way to go because the more time you can spend on the language the better. 

'There are lots of primary schools across the country that teach Mandarin but no so many that go up to Year 12. 

'Taking a bilingual approach enables you to spend more time learning the language, that is why it is so good,

'By learning subjects like maths and geography it means the kids have got to use the language to learn .

'I would like to see more of these kinds of schools throughout Australia, the European Union has done this with English for many years. 

'Chinese is very important in Australia, it is the second language in ACT and so it's an important community language. 

'Anyone at a bilingual school would be at a distinct advantage because they would have had more time to learn the language so by the time they come to the jobs market they should know the language.' 

Chad Sexton-Finck, is the principal of Redcliffe Primary School in WA which has taught Mandarin for the last three years and he called the new initiative 'terrific'. 

'We have got no bilingual schools in WA. This is a great idea. My children speak three languages so I think this is very important' he added.
