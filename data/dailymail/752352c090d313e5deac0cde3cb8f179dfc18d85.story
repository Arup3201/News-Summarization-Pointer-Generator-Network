Chris 'Birdman' Andersen has finally cleared his name after authorities revealed the Miami Heat star was the victim of an elaborate catfishing scheme where a woman in Canada posed as him online and then attempted to extort him.

The then-Denver Nuggets basketball star was dumped from the team in 2012 after investigators with the local sheriff's department raided his Larkspur, Colorado home in a child pornography probe.

He was not arrested and no charges were filed. Days later his attorney Mark Bryant released a statement claiming the NBA star was an extortion victim who was threatened by the mother of an underage California woman he had a liaison with after she lied about how old she was.

But on Wednesday another twist in the 
bizarre story was revealed, finally clearing the basketball player's 
name once and for all.

Hoax: Chris 'Birdman' Anderson has finally cleared his name after authorities revealed the Miami Heat star was the victim of an elaborate catfishing scheme

According to Sports Illustrated, Andersen and his attorney were called to meet with a local district attorney, a Douglas County investigator and a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Denver about a month ago.

They told them a Canadian woman had been pretending to be Andersen online and communicated to a number of people, including the underage girl in California.

Andersen did in fact have sex with the young woman but the 29-year-old Canadian catfisher was the one who initially orchestrated their relationship.

Though his fling lied to Anderson 
that she was 21, he appears to have broken no laws in Colorado where the
statutory age of consent in 17.

After
the pair had sex, the Canadian continued to communicate with the woman 
from California posing as Andersen and began making sexually explicit 
demands of her.

Finally, the young woman went to 
authorities and reported basketball player, triggering the investigation of his 
home by the Internet Crimes Against Children unit. Investigators seized 
his computer and other electronic equipment.

Investigators
said the Canadian woman managed to gain complete access to Andersen's 
phone, social media accounts, email, and bank records and may have 
played similar scams on other athletes.

But as well as posing as Andersen, 
the woman then pretended to be the California girl's mother and tried to
extort the basketball player.

RCMP confirmed to The Denver Post
that Shelly Lynn Chartier, 29, has been charged with a string of 
crimes, including possession and transmitting of child pornography, 
impersonation, extortion, and making threats. However, they would not 
confirm that Chartier is the woman in question.

Chartier lives in Easterville, Manitoba, a town of fewer than 100 residents on the shores of Cedar Lake nearly 300 miles north of Winnipeg. She was charged in January and is scheduled to make a court appearance in October, The Post reported.

The 18th Judicial District Court in Colorado is currently reviewing over 4,000 pages of documents that were amassed during the investigation and may file charges in Colorado.

A spokesperson told SI that it does not plan on bringing any charges against Andersen who is thrilled to put the ordeal behind him.

'I can't tell you how much Chris agonized over the label placed on him,' Bryant told SI. 'This has had an extraordinary effect on Chris ... He appreciates those who reserved judgment. He will continue to do what he's always done in life and that's turn something bad hopefully into something good.'
