People living in remote western New South Wales have a shorter life than someone who lives in North Korea or Iraq, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has reported in their latest data.

The life expectancy in rural NSW is one of the worst in the country, according to an analysis by Fairfax Media. 

Andrew Lewis, the mayor of Bourke Shire -which is one of the worst affected areas in Australia, said your chances of death is much higher when living in a rural area.

In Iraq life expectancy is 68.5 - higher than the Northern Territory, Western Australia and western New South Wales

'We always talk about the bush being a good lifestyle, but you die out here. 

'It's a "she'll be right" attitude. Next thing you know, you're dead.' 

For 10 years now rural towns in western NSW has been among the bottom 10 areas for life expectancy; Walgett, Forbes and Bourke.  

But Scott McLachlan, the chief executive officer of the Western NSW Local Health District, said the results came to no surprise. 

'It is something we are determined to fix through changing lifestyles. Western NSW has some of the highest rates of obesity and smoking in the country.' 

In Bourke the average death rate in 2013 was three times lower compared to that of Snowy River in southern New South Wales and Manly in Sydney.  

But behind NSW's remote life expectancy of 67.8 years falls Western Australia and the Northern Territory. 

In North Korea people tend to live till 69 and in Iraq life expectancy is 68.5, the World Health Organisation reports. 

Northern Territory's life expectancy is equal to that of Liberia, which is currently in the midst of the Ebola crisis.

Bourke's low life expectancy could be related to the amount of Aboriginal people who live in the area and suffer from a chronic lack of health services

When it comes to why Western Australia has a lower life expectancy rate than countries like Iraq and North Korea it can be put down to the fact that it is three times the size of NSW, which means health services would be three times greater.  

As for western NSW, Mr McLachlan explains that the high death rate  occurs because of the amount of people with diabetes, obesity and heavy smoking rates.

Bourke's low life expectancy could be related to the amount of Aboriginal people who live in the area and suffer from a chronic lack of health services.

Compared to an average town in NSW, The Snowy River has less than half the Aboriginal population and Manly has 10 times less. 

 'Western NSW is the area that we have always needed to work on. There is clearly a long way to go,'  Dr Zakia Hossain, a demographer and sociologist from the University of Sydney. 

Earlier this year, Bourke's birthing hospital closed down and now their Medicare Local service is under threat. 

The Local Health District believes the scarce amount of GPs with obstetric and anaesthetic skills could give reason to the dying facilities in western NSW.

Now, Mr Lewis is calling on the state government to tackle the health system in the west. 

But Mr McLachlan said NSW's healthcare plan will  be delivering services within the next three years to the areas that most require it.

'It is incredibly hard to recruit the qualified professionals to the area,' he said.   

While the rural areas continue to struggle, the prestige Sydney areas in NSW such as Mosman and Woollahra have topped  life expectancy, despite ageing populations. They can expect to live past 80-years-old.

Tasmania's health system is also flourishing, which may be due to its small population.    

'Tasmania's two most remote areas are both islands – Flinders Island and King Island – and both of these communities are serviced by community health centres,' the Tasmanian Health Minister, Michael Ferguson, said.

'Access to these centres can be significantly better than in remote areas interstate, which in turn leads to better overall primary healthcare, especially from a prevention perspective.'
