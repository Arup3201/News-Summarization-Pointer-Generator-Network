A British motorcycle racer died from massive head injuries after he was thrown from his bike during a desert race competition in Abu Dhabi.

Cameron Waugh, 50, came off his motocross bike and was found by another rider whilst taking part in the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge in April.

Jakub Przygonksi set off a satellite alarm and performed CPR on the father-of-three before paramedics arrived but he was already in cardiac arrest and later died in hospital.

Cameron Waugh, 50, died from massive head injuries following the accident in Abu Dhabi in April

An inquest into his death was held at Shrewsbury Coroner’s Court on Wednesday and heard that Mr Waugh was found lying unresponsive by the side of his bike.

Two doctors and a paramedic arrived at the scene by helicopter within 13 minutes, and Mr Waugh was immediately transferred to hospital, but despite the efforts of medics he died on April 6.

Coroner’s officer Neil Jenkins told the court: ‘No other persons or vehicles were thought to be involved in the incident.

‘There were no eyewitnesses to Mr Waugh becoming unseated from his motorcycle.’

After the accident Mr Waugh’s body was flown back to the UK and examined by staff at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital they recorded his death to be the result of a motorcycle accident.

The inquest heard that Mr Waugh lived in Dubai and worked as a general manager of a crane company from 2006 and was joined in the emirate by his family in 2011.

A statement read to the court from his wife, Jane, said: ‘Cameron was an upstanding character and is sadly missed by all who knew him.’

His father Gordon Waugh said he believed his son had hit a sand dune at an angle and been thrown from the bike.

He said some of the sand dunes were hundreds of feet high and riders travelled at high speed during the challenge.

Recording the death as an accident Coroner for Shropshire John Ellery said: ‘He was clearly an experienced motorcyclist and would not have lost control for no reason.

‘It is awful for you and for his family.’

He recorded the verdict of Mr Waugh’s death as accidental.

The website for the event says the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge is ‘a five-day motor sport spectacular’ being staged in its entirety across Abu Dhabi emirate.

It says the event is ‘expected to further strengthen Abu Dhabi’s credentials as a tourism destination of distinction and major sporting events hub’.

The event began on April 3 and finished on April 10.

‘He was one of our regular competitors, and a very likeable and popular one who loved the sport, and we have lost one of our own today.

‘Safety is always our top priority, and the highly motivated professionals in our Search and Rescue and medical teams who responded to today’s accident did everything within their power. Our thoughts are with Cameron’s family.’
