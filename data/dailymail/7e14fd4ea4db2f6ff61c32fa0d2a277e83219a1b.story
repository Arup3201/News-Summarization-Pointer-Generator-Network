Three Los Angeles cops who shot dead an unarmed man on live TV following a high-speed chase last year violated department rules pertaining to the use of deadly force, Police Chief Charles Beck has found.

Brian Newt Breaird, a 51-year-old disabled National Guard veteran, was struck by 13 bullets in downtown Los Angeles on the night of December 13, 2013.

Local news stations carried live the high-speed police pursuit, along with its bloody aftermath. One of the people who watched Beaird go down in a hail of bullets was his father.

Police Chief Beck has concluded in a recently released report cited by Los Angeles Times that the officers' decision to use deadly force on an unarmed man was unjustified.

The three cops, identified in a previous report as Michael Ayala, Armando Corral, and Leonardo Ortiz, have alleged that they opened fire on the veteran because they believed they lives were in danger, but Beck rejected their claims.

'The preponderance of the evidence does not independently support [the officers’] perceptions that a deadly threat was present,' Beck wrote in the report.

Video footage of the conformation showed how the man had turned around and was moving away from the officers when they fired a volley at him.

The year-long investigation into the shooting has found that the three bullets that most likely ended Beaird's life struck him from behind.

The trio of officers, among them two rookies and a seven-year veteran of the department, have been on leave since the December 2013 incident.

Fearing for their lives: The officers told investigators they opened fire on Beaird, striking him 13 times - including in the back - because they believed he was armed 

It is now up to Chief Beck to decide whether or not to punish the officers in question. They could face suspension or termination.

Larry Hanna, an attorney hired to represent the officers, defended their actions saying they went out there that night trying to do the best job they could.

The December 13 shooting followed a nearly hour-long nighttime pursuit for reckless driving that ended when Beaird's silver Corvette ran a string of red lights, hit a car in an intersection, seriously injuring the other driver, and then spun onto a downtown sidewalk. 

Beaird's father, Billy Beaird , watched in horror on live TV as his son staggered out of the Corvette, briefly raised his hands, was fatally shot multiple times in the front and back, and fell to the ground.

He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later. A toxicology test determined Beaird had methamphetamine and traces of other drugs in his system. 

All three officers in the shooting told investigators they shot Beaird because they saw him reaching for his waistband and making erratic, jerking motions with his hands, which led them to believe he had a gun.

One of the cops went so far as to say he believed Bearid was actually shooting at them.

In May, the elder Mr Beaird filed a $20million wrongful death lawsuit against the city alleging that officers violated his son's state and federal civil rights.

Four months later, the Los Angeles City Council voted to pay Beaird's family $5million to settle the lawsuit.

Billy Beaird had told the Los Angeles Times that his son was discharged from the National Guard in 1988 after undergoing surgery for a brain tumor and needed regular medical care.

The family's attorney, Dale K. Galipo, said Beaird was paranoid at the time of the chase.

'He couldn't understand why the police were chasing him, and he didn't know what to do," Galipo said. 'He called his family during the pursuit and asked what he should do. And they told him he should pull over ... and he said "I'm afraid" and kept going.'
