A family of five set themselves alight in a desperate final protest against the demolition of their home.

Bharat Mansingh, 40, died in hospital after self-immolating in the centre of a local authority compound in the city of Rajkot in north west India today.

Three of his females relatives, Rekha, Asha, Vasumati and one male relative Girish Mansingh have all been taken to hospital with severe burns.

Desperation: Rescue workers put out the flames after five people from the same family set fire to themselves outside a council office in Rajkot

Treatment: All five people were taken to hospital where one later died. The family is originally from Nepal

Two are said to be in a critical condition.

It is believed the horrendous act 
stems from a long-running dispute between families living on a common 
plot in the Chotu Nagar areas of the city.

The Mansingh family, who are 
understood to be Nepalese immigrants, believed the Rajkot Municipal 
Corporation was going to demolish their home and came to discuss the 
situation with the civic body today.

When they failed to get satisfactory 
answers they doused themselves in kerosene and set themselves alight as 
helpless passers-by looked on.

Emergency services managed to douse 
the flames and all five were taken to Rajkot Civil Hospital where 
40-year-old Bharat Mansingh later died.

Police Commissioner H P Singh told 
Press Trust India that the family were in a dispute with the Chotu Nagar
Cooperative Housing Society, who they believed was planning to evict 
them.

‘Bharat Mansingh died while undergoing treatment while the other four have sustained severe burns,’ Commissioner Singh said. 

Intervention: Two of the Mansinghs are doused in water to stop their suicide

Helpless: A crowd watched helpless as the Mansingh family poured kerosene over their bodies and set themselves alight

The family, who had been living in 
their house for several years, believed that it has been condemned as an
unauthorised structure.

The co-operative later denied they planned to evict the family and said they had no plans to demolish the house.

The news has quickly become a 
political issue in India with the opposition party accusing the Rajkot 
Municipal Corporation of having harassed the family.

There were calls for a bandh, or general strike, to protest their treatment across Rajkot on Thursday.
