A four-year-old girl is battling a disease that means her tiny bones could shatter at the slightest knock.

Hollie Hunter from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, suffers from Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, which affects just one in 200,000 children.

Hollie was diagnosed after she broke her arm in a minor fall and now doctors are hoping to be able to cure her with chemotherapy.

Hollie Hunter (pictured with her mother, Kim) suffers from Langerhans' cell histiocytosis a rare cancer-like condition which affects just one in 200,000 children in the UK. She was diagnosed after breaking her arm

Her mother, Kim, said: 'It was a typical fall, but when I thought about what happened it just didn’t add up. Hollie fell on soft grass so the impact shouldn’t have broken her arm. It wasn’t normal.'

At first, consultants feared Hollie had cancer.

Her mother, a biomedical scientist at a Sunderland hospital, recalled the moment she was ushered into a room by doctors.

She said: 'They asked me to come into this room and I kept thinking it wasn’t right.

'They thought Hollie might have cancer and over the next few days we lived at the hospital as they did loads of tests.'

What followed was an anxious wait as Hollie went through a series of MRI scans and biopsies only for consultants to realise she did not have cancer after all.

The condition has left Hollie with very brittle bones meaning her mother has to keep a constant eye on her in case she knocks herself and breaks a bone

But her mother's relief was short-lived as doctors soon broke the news that Holly was instead suffering from Langerhans' cell histiocytosis.

The condition develops when the body has too many Langerhans' cells - these normally develop to protect the skin but when there are too many present they can move around the body causing damage.

The disease can affect the bones and organs and can cause a range of symptoms from loss of appetite to bone pain and a rash.

The condition has a high survival rate and can be treated with chemotherapy as the chemotherapy drugs help to destroy the excess Langerhans' cells.

When doctors examined Hollie they discovered more than 20 bone lesions throughout her body, including in the back of her skull. Her family is now praying her chemotherapy treatment is successful

Specialists believe Hollie may have been born with the condition - leaving her little body a ticking time bomb and doctors amazed an accident did not happened sooner. 

Ms Hunter said: 'Breaking her arm was a blessing in disguise.

'We would have been none the wiser and she could have done far more serious damage because her bones are being eaten away.'

LCH is not technically a cancer, but it behaves like a cancer and it can be treated with chemotherapy.

It is named after Dr Paul Langerhans who first described the cells in the skin from which the disease develops.

Langerhans' cells are normally only found in the skin and major airways.

In people with LCH, the cells are abnormal and are found in other parts of the body including the bone marrow, lungs, liver, spleen and lymph glands.

When they are present in these tissues they can cause damage.

LCH is divided into two groups - single-system LCH which just affects one part of the body, such as the bones, and multi-system LCH which affects more than one part of the body.

About 50 children in the UK develop LCH every year - it is more common in boys than girls.

Symptoms include poor appetite, irritability, bone pain, a rash, hearing problems, breathing difficulties and jaundice.

Single-system LCH may disappear on its own without treatment.

Multi-system LCH is usually treated with chemotherapy as it can help destroy the LCH cells.

80 to 90 per cent of children with LCH make a full recovery.

When doctors examined Hollie they discovered more than 20 bone lesions throughout her body, including in the back of her skull.

Her mother must now constantly watch over her as she could suffer a break from the slightest knock.

She can no longer join in with playtime games and is also prone to infection.

Hollie is undergoing an 18 month course of chemotherapy and has a tube fitted in her chest to administer a drug cocktail doctors have devised to fight the disease.

She would have had regular biopsies but these were halted when doctors grew concerned Hollie’s bones may fracture as they tried to take tissue samples.

Hollie's aunt, Amanda, 39, always attends her chemotherapy sessions.

She said: 'Chemo scares Hollie so much and fighting the fear is a massive thing.'

Hollie has her own unique way of getting through the sessions - with a little help from her favourite pop star Rhianna.

Amanda said: 'Hollie can be a bit of a diva and she loves Rhianna, so on the way to the hospital we always sing "Diamond" and by the end Hollie is saying "I can do this".'

But there is no knowing whether the chemotherapy will work and the steroids she is prescribed have changed Hollie’s personality.

Amanda said: 'They give her terrible mood swings. We laugh about it and call her a little monster, but it’s been hard for her school friends who’ve had to quickly learn about her condition.'

Amanda, a mental health nurse, has thrown all her efforts into fundraising for The Histiocytosis Research Trust.

She said: 'It’s just my way of getting through things. Kim was, and still is, in a state of shock but she raised over £3,000 when she skydived in September.'

Hollie is due to start her next round of chemotherapy this month. Her family is praying the treatment will work and, for now, are trying to keep life as normal as possible.
