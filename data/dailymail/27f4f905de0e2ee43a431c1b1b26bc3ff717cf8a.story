NBC and the 'Today' show have come under fire from for their decision to air an interview with 'Keeping up With the Kardashians' matriarch Kris Jenner about her breast implants instead of this morning's moment of silence at 8.46.a.m. held in memory of the victims of 9/11.

As ABC's 'Good Morning America' and 'CBS This Morning' carried the minutes silence from the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, viewers of NBC across the country had to rely upon their local affiliate to interrupt 'Today' to witness the poignant ceremonies.

While most friends and family of the victims of 9/11 were attending events at Ground Zero, Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania, they expressed their shock afterwards that the network had chosen to be the only national news program not to broadcast the minutes silence.

At the precise moment that CBS and ABC were broadcasting the moment's silence to commemorate 9/11 from Washington D.C and New York City, NBC's 'Today' show was airing an interview with Kris Jenner to the majority of the nation

Dennis McKeon who runs the support group  'Where to Turn' for 1,500 families affected by 9/11 said that for him NBC's decision to air the interview with Kris Jenner at 8.46 a.m. was disappointing but not unexpected.

Should NBC apologize for airing Kris Jenner interview instead of 9/11 moment of silence on Today show?

'I was at Ground Zero this morning so I didn't see the interview on television, but it's a disgrace to not show the moments silence ceremony at the time of the attack,' said 55-year-old McKeon whose friend John J. Lennon, a Port Authority policeman died in the Twin Towers collapse in 2001.

'Last year was a big deal with the 10th anniversary and the president came down and this year it wasn't even a 1/4 of the size - which is hurtful to the family members of victims and survivors.

'The newspapers and television stations have relegated it and the fact of the matter is that they are looking for ratings.'

U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama observe a moment of silence to mark the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, on September 11, 2012.

Instead of watching the events from 
Washington D.C. where President Obama was in attendance and New York 
where families of the victims and representatives of the NYPD, FDNY and 
Port Authority Police gathered, the majority of NBC viewers were treated
to Kris Jenner discussing her latest breast operation.

'Shame on them: NBC skips 9/11 moment of silence for Kardashian interview,' wrote B.Loco on Twitter , expressing her outrage.

Sports
talk radio host Tony Bruno took to his Twitter account to say, 'Wow, 
just Wow. NBC should be ashamed beyond belief and ridiculed by ALL!'

The
beleaguered morning show took another hit from Twitter user 
@karentvchick, who said that the decision was 'Disgusting. Would love to
know why @TodayShow thought Kris Jenner was more important: Job 
openings soon?'

Another wrote, 'The fact that Kris Jenner is a guest on the today show on 9/11 seriously makes me doubt humanity.'

Following the moment of silence other networks quickly jumped back into 
their routine as CBS went to a commercial break and ABC began an 
interview with Richard Gere.

For its later West Coast feed, the network did show the commemoration of
the first moment. Ceremonies took place at the World Trade Center and 
the White House lawn.

Speaking
with 'Today's' Savannah Guthrie on Tuesday, Jenner, the star of 
'Keeping up with the Kardashians' discussed September 9th's penultimate 
episode that showcased her plans to get her 23-year-old  breast implants
replaced.

Users of Twitter took to the social networking site to express their disgust over the perceived lack of respect from NBC in broadcasting an interview with Kris Jenner instead of the 9/11 moment of silence at 8.46. a.m.

Twitter users expressed their displeasure at the reality television star receiving coverage above the moment of silence for 9/11 on the anniversary of the atrocity

'I thought it was such a great idea to film that,' Jenner told TODAY's Savannah Guthrie Tuesday morning.

'The reason I went in and did that was because I had had my implants in for 152 years -- you know, a long time, way longer than their shelf life.'

And as Jenner discussed her first breast operation since 1989 all the cable channels and CBS and ABC were broadcasting the moment silence and viewers took to Twitter to express their disgust.

Some called the network's decision a 'major fail' and a 'new all time low', while another Twitter user simply said 'Shame on them' for their broadcast choice.

Megan Kopf, a spokesperson with the Today show, defended the network's coverage of the 9/11 anniversary ceremony.

'The Today show dedicated a considerable amount of time to September 
11th coverage this morning throughout the entire show,' said Kopf to POLITICO.

This tops off a summer to forget for NBC, during which the network has taken criticism for their delayed airing of Olympic events such as Usain Bolt's victory in the 100 metres sprint and asked why it did not show more of the London paralympic games.

And in the months before the Olympic games, NBC's 'Today' show was rocked by the loss of its formely undisputed morning rating's crown to ABC's 'Good Morning America' and moved Ann Curry off the 'Today' show sofa due to a lack of chemistry with co-host Matt Lauer.

During the five minute interview about her cosmetic surgery aired at 8.45. a.m., Jenner, 56, said that all women should be aware of the shelf life of their breast implants.

'You know, take them out and change them after 10 years,' Jenner urged all woman with implants.

'That was a big message and important for me to sort of put out there in a comical way.

'You know, I made fun of myself. Because at my age, you're over 50 -- like, when do you stop?

'But it was so important, health-wise, to remind women to check your expiration date because it's a health risk.'

'I had my implants done in 1989 and that was a long time ago.'

'It is really important to pay attention to what your body is telling you and my body was saying, 'You're tired, it's enough get it fixed.'

Twitter users such as Tony Bruno said that NBC should be ashamed of themselves for airing an interview with Kris Jenner instead of the 9/11 moment of silence in Washington D.C. and New York City

Discussing her daughter Kim's relationship with Hip Hop star Kanye West, Jenner said that she couldn't be happier for her daughter.

'He's a great guy, I mean he is really a great guy and I think they are well suited for each other and I think they are really really happy and anybody who has kids knows that when your kids are happy, you are happy,' said Jenner.

While she and her family prepare for the seventh season finale of their wildly succesful reality television show, the self proclaimed 'momager' has said that she is looking forward to the resolution of her daughter Khloe Kardashina's attempts to become pregnant and start a family.

Kim Kardashian appeared on ABC's 'The View' on September 5th ahead of the final two episodes of this seasons 'Keeping up with the Kardashians'

'She is doing good, she is really positive,' said Jenner.

'Somethings I watch back and I think wow, that's kinda crazy or hard to watch.

'But we love what we do, were're having a really good time and as I say over and over again, I get to wake up and work with my family.'

'And it doesn't get any better than that, I love what we are doing.'
