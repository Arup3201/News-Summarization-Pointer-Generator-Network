Workers at a luxury Paris hotel where one night in a suite can cost more than their annual salary are taking strike action.

Staff at the five-star Royal Monceau-Raffles - where the presidential suite costs just under £20,000 a night - are the latest to stage a walk-out over their low wages yesterday.

Last month, workers at two Hyatt hotels were granted better salaries after days of protest that cost the hotels tens of thousands in lost bookings.

Protest: Workers at the Royal Monceau-Raffles hotel are striking over low wages

Valets, bartenders, chambermaids, cooks and other employees at the Royal Monceau-Raffles have now demonstrated in the Champs-Elysees to demand better treatment from their Qatari owners Katara Hospitality.

Striking chambermaid Sabrina Sedik, who earns £1,000 a month, said: 'All we demand is a rise of £1.50 an hour. Simply a decent salary.'

Protesters chanted and held signs that said 'Qatar! You must pay!' and 'Excellence in service = mediocre salaries'.

Extravagant: The Presidential Suite costs £19,784.40 - more than most of the striking workers make in a year

Another unnamed maid and mother-of-two added: 'I've worked in this hotel for 15 years and my salary has never increased. We decided to go on strike because employees at other luxury hotels are better paid than us.' 

A spokesperson for Le Royal Monceau – Raffles Paris said: 'The strike, by some of the employees of Le Royal Monceau – Raffles Paris, initiated by delegates of the CGT union, continues. Only 11 per cent of the hotel’s total employees are involved. 

'The management of the hotel respects the right of these employees to strike. The vast majority of the hotel’s staff continue to serve our clients from around the world.

'FRHI Hotels & Resorts, the management company of Le Royal Monceau – Raffles Paris, confirms its clear commitment to a continued dialogue, which has been initiated by the hotel management.'

'Rising movement': A CGT Union spokesperson says the protests are expected to spread to other hotels

CGT Union spokesman Karl Ghazi said: 'This strike comes on the heels of protests in other hotels in Paris.

'It's a rising movement that risks spreading to other luxury hotels.'

In September, chamber maids, valets and other employees at the Hyatt Paris-Madeleine hotel obtained a monthly pay rise of at around £400 after an eight-day strike.

That same month, workers at the Park Hyatt Paris-Vendome also got a significant salary increase after protesting against their low wages.
