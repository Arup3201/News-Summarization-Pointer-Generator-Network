A man who passed out at a friend's party woke up with more than a hangover when he discovered a guest had tattooed his back.   

While Josh Darnbrough, 24, slept, his mate Rob Gaskell, also 24, inked the words 'If found face down call an ambulance' on his back, using a DIY kit.

Josh, from Mossley, near Ashton, only discovered the prank the following day after looking in a mirror - and said his partner went 'absolutely bonkers' when she saw it. 

Josh Darnbrough awoke after a party to find that his friend had tattooed his back 

Josh (centre) was tattooed by his friend Rob Gaskell (right) who was taking revenge on his mate after Josh had attempted to tattoo Rob with an at-home kit and it went horribly wrong 

Rob said he carried out the practical joke on Josh, who had passed out at a New Year's Eve party, in revenge for a tattoo Josh did on Rob's leg two years ago - which had gone horribly wrong.

Starting off with a design for a lizard, Josh tried to turn it into a cross, then some hands and a gun - leading to one almighty, permanent mess on Rob's leg and causing his partner to go 'bonkers'. 

So when he saw Josh passed out at the party, Rob - who is a father of three - said he 'couldn't resist' the opportunity to execute revenge - and spent 30 minutes etching his own design into his mate's back.

Amazingly, the prank hasn't harmed the pair's friendship - and the childhood friends, who are both having their tattoos removed, still see each other every day.

But Rob does admit to regretting the prank once he had sobered up. He said: 'The opportunity presented itself and I couldn't resist.

'I didn't feel guilty when I was doing it because I'd had a few drinks myself but I was quite remorseful afterwards and asked everyone not to tell Josh who had done it.'

Josh, who is a support worker, said although it was a shock, he has managed to see the funny side.

'I was pretty astonished when I looked in the mirror - I thought, "I didn't go to bed with a tattoo"', he said.

'I didn't know when I'd got it and no one would tell me who'd done it. But since I found out it was Rob it hasn't affected our friendship at all - we still see each other every day. It's just practical jokes between mates.'

Rob, also a support worker, added that he would advise anyone against at-home tattoos. 

'We had bought a DIY tattoo kit online and originally it was a well-intentioned exercise,' he said. 'Then when it didn't turn out right it dawned on me this was forever and I was stuck with it.

The pair are both getting their tattoos removed by laser technician Maria Patricia (right) and say the incident hasn't affected their friendship 

'Josh started off doing a lizard, then a cross, then some hands and a gun - he did an abomination of a job and every time he tried to touch it up it got worse.

'When my partner saw it she went absolutely bonkers. If anyone is thinking of trying their own DIY tattoos - I would just say, don't.'

The pair are now getting their tattoos removed with laser treatment - carried out by technician Maria Patricia at the clinic she runs based at her Ashton home.

Maria, 47, who started her business four years ago, says she has seen an increasing number of people seeking help after getting DIY tattoos.

'We are not against tattoos here at all, but DIY ones can lead to problems,' she said.

'Sometimes people come in and it's scarred because they have pushed the needle too far in and dragged it.

'You can also get infections or what we call 'blow out' when the needle is pushed in so deep there is nowhere the ink can go and it just spreads, looking like a bruise.

'No laser can get that out when it happens, you just have to get a cover-up tattoo.'

Surprisingly enough Maria would also advise on going to professional rather than doing your tattoos yourself.  

'We've definitely seen an increase in people coming to us with home made tattoos since we opened.

'We're just trying to say to people if you want a tattoo done, go somewhere professional, do not use one of these DIY kits.'
