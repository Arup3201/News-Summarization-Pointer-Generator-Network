Erica Capasso of Howell, Missouri, was arrested at her workplace after a seven-month long investigation by Ocean County detectives

A 26-year-old woman has been arrested for allegedly posting nude photographs of her ex-boyfriend online ending a seven-month investigation into the source of the pictures.

Erica Capasso, from Howell, Missouri, has been charged with invasion of privacy and bias crimes.

According to the Asbury Park Press, the pictures were posted with 'racially charged and threatening remarks'.

Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph D. Coronato is quoted saying the comments were shared online 'in order to intimidate her former boyfriend'.

Capasso was arrested at her workplace in Howell on Friday after investigators in Ocean County, where her ex-boyfriend lives, collaborated with detectives in Missouri.

She was taken into custody by members of Ocean County prosecutor's High Tech Crime Unit.

Capasso is charged with one count of 
third-degree invasion of privacy and one count of second-degree bias 
crimes, according to APP.com.

Bail has been set at $15,000 with no 10 per cent option as set by Ocean County Superior Court Judge Francis Hodgson.

She was sent to the Ocean County jail in Toms River in default of bail, the news service said.

It is the latest case of an Internet user being arrested and charged for an alleged crime caused by their comments or picture posts online.
