The TV presenter has produced a guide to the local language for footballing fans heading to Brazil - and has even managed to include his catchphrase 'Unbelievable Jeff!'

The ‘Learn Brazilian-Portuguese with Chris Kamara’ will air on British Airways flights from May 19 and includes some trues classics for fans who want to yell from the stands and discuss the finer points of football with the locals.

 viewers how to order local drinks and cuisine, as well as sporting 
lingo.

 said: 'I’m one of the many people heading to Brazil this summer, so it 
was great to have personal tuition from the local British Airways cabin 
crew to learn the essentials – you know, how to order an ice-cold beer,

entertaining.
