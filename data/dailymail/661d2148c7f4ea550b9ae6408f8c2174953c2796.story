Jailed: Rostam Ahmadi, 23, launched a savage and random attack on Umesh Chaudhari yards from his home

An illegal immigrant who battered a father-of-two to death with a brick after being released on bail for robbery was locked up indefinitely today.

Rostam Ahmadi, 23, launched the savage random attack on 41-year-old Umesh Chaudhari just a few yards from the victim’s home in Croydon, south London.

Mr Chaudhari’s horrified wife and children rushed out of their house to find Ahmadi repeatedly slamming a brick down on to his head.

It took the combined strength of two neighbours to wrestle the attacker away from the victim and pin him down on the floor until the police arrived.

But Mr Chaudhari had suffered multiple skull fractures and died in hospital of brain damage the following day.

Ordering him to be detained under the Mental Health Act indefinitely, judge Richard Marks QC said: ‘The particular tragedy of these events is compounded by the fact is you should not even have been in this country.'

Ahmadi claimed to be an 18-year-old refugee from Afghanistan but later said he was born in Iran in 1989.

He claimed asylum in the UK in 2007 but was refused an extension of his leave to remain in October 2010.

In February 2011 his appeal was dismissed and he should have left the country.

But three months later on May 30 last year he robbed a woman walking across Mitcham Common in south London.

Killed: Umesh Chaudhari was attacked just a few yards from his home and in front of his family in Croydon but died the following day

Manisha Bungsy noticed he was following her and headed for the nearest road while trying to phone her husband.

He followed her and when she asked what he wanted he slapped her in the face, grabbed her phone and ran back on to the common.

Ahmadi was arrested nearby and told police he was angry and had been drinking and smoking cannabis.

He was released on bail and on July 6 last year attacked Mr Chaudhari as the victim left his house in Dennett Road.

Mr Chaudhari, who had come to the UK from Nepal in 2003 to provide a better life for his children, worked 70 hours a week at Tesco in Addiscombe during the day and at a restaurant in the City of London at night.

Wife Rekha Sah said in a statement that he left for work at Tesco’s earlier than usual to cover his boss’s shift.

‘The incident happened outside the neighbour’s house within five minutes of him leaving,’ she added.

Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow told the court: ‘Members of the public were awoken by sounds of running footsteps and then by screaming.

‘A neighbour looked out to see the defendant push the deceased over a wall. She then saw him take the victim by the neck.

‘Umesh Chaudhari attempted to break free but the defendant picked up a brick and repeatedly struck the deceased over the head.’

Another neighbour ran out and pleaded with Ahmadi: ‘Stop it you are going to kill him’ but he continued his attack.

Two neighbours then ran out to push Ahmadi off the victim and put him in a headlock.

Ahmadi told them that if they did not let him go he was going to kill everyone, the Old Bailey heard.

Mr Glasgow told how Mr Chaudhari’s wife and children also witnessed the attack after coming out of their house a few doors down.

‘The deceased’s son and daughter speak in moving terms of the effect upon them of witnessing the assault.’

Police officers arrived to find Ahmadi being restrained by three members of the public and Mr Chaudhari being cradled in the arms of his wife.

Ahmadi later claimed he had no mental health issues although there were marks of self harm on his arm.

The Old Bailey: The judge heard how Ahmadi was suffering from schizophrenia

In custody he was seen to punch the walls and heard saying: ‘Do you know why I punched someone, because of Allah and jihad.’

Psychiatrists later diagnosed Ahmadi as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.

Ahmadi, of Dennett Road, Croydon, was charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility.

He has previous convictions for battery and theft in 2010 and criminal damage in April 2011.

Judge Marks said: ‘Umesh Chaudhari was a good man. He was in every way a fine upstanding member of the community and a devoted family man.

‘Having picked up a brick you repeatedly struck him with that brick over the head. His screams alerted his wife and children who came out of the house and saw him in a dreadful state.

‘The loss suffered by his wife and children cannot be overstated. The pain they have had to endure is difficult to comprehend.

‘It is clear you continue to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia although you are responding to treatment. I have do doubt whatsoever that it was your very serious illness that explains how and why you did what you did.’

Mr Chaudhari's wife said in a victim impact statement that her husband’s death had left the family devastated.

‘I lost my loving husband and my children lost their loving and caring father. Umesh had many dreams about our future.

‘My children have found it difficult to concentrate on their studies. We had to move because of the bad memories.

‘Umesh was the sole earner in the family. I feel I will not be able to fund my children’s education. Life has been tough without Umesh.

‘Umesh was a friendly person and got on well with everyone. He was popular at work. He was very hardworking and a religious man and he had a good sense of humour.

‘Due to his murder I feel very vulnerable and I fear for my children’s safety when they leave the house.’
