Prince William, seen here with a black rhino, was struck by the rhinos' plight on his gap year

The Duke of Cambridge has called for a halt to the killing of rhinos for their horns as experts warn that Africa is facing the worst poaching crisis in decades.

The Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, where William proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010, reported five slaughtered rhinos in a fortnight last month - and says that the lucrative poaching trade poses a 'grave threat' to the already endangered species.

A St James's Palace spokesman said: 'The Duke is concerned that action must be taken now to stem the tide before it is too late and these magnificent creatures become lost to the wild forever.

'Species conservation is something the Duke feels passionate about.  He has been keeping a close eye on the poaching crisis, particularly involving Africa's rhinoceros and elephants, and is alarmed by the increase in the numbers being killed.'

The most recent spate of killings occurred at Lewa, a 62,000-acre sanctuary where the Duke spent part of his gap year.  They reported the shootings of five black rhinos in December, and says thieves got away with two sets of horns.

Rhino horns are highly prized for perceived medicinal benefits, and used against a variety of complaints including cancer and hangovers.  It is particularly popular in the Far East, where it can sell for around £20,000 a pound, making it more valuable than gold.

A Kenyan can sell a single rhino horn for the equivalent of a year's salary, which makes it an attractive proposition for would-be hunters in the country.  Ivory from elephants' tusks is also prized.

As a result, the poachers are becoming more and more sophisticated, despite the animal sanctuaries' best efforts.

Lewa, which is home to 126 white and black rhinos, was founded in 1995 and had not lost a rhino to poachers until 2009, when a female was gunned down near the border with Ngare Ndare Forest.  Since then,  a total of 11 have been slaughtered by poachers.

A Lewa spokeswoman said: '2012 was our blackest year.  The severity and frequency of these attacks is a clear indication of the level of threat that Lewa's rhinos face, the highest in history.

'The poacher is no longer a long gunman with a mask; the hefty price paid for African rhino horn has attracted international organised crime syndicates that are eager to cash in at the expense of an entire species.

'Poachers have become increasingly sophisticated, using the latest gadgets and intelligence to spot and kill rhinos.'

Lewa is one of the best protected sanctuaries in Africa, with 150 wildlife rangers, many of them armed, patrolling the vast reserve 24 hours a day.

Mike Watson, the sanctuary's chief executive, said security was being stepped up in the wake of the attacks.

He said: 'Lewa is now more than ever determined to counter these threats by increasing our security and monitoring efforts.'

A World Wildlife Fund rhino expert said the poachers would wipe out the endangered species if they were not stopped.  They said at least 593 rhinos were slaughtered in Africa last year.

Dr Joseph Okori, WWF's rhino programme leader, said: 'The rhino faces extinction within 10 years if we do not reverse this trend.

'Villagers are at the bottom of the chain and can earn several months' income through two or three days' poaching.

'Huge amounts of money are in circulation.'

WWF-UK's Drew McVey said: 'Since 2010, there have been successive record highs in the numbers of rhinos being poached each year.

'We need urgent action to tackle this trade, with governments working together to address the problem globally, as it won’t be solved by any one country on its own.'

Charlie Mayhew, chief executive of Tusk Trust, which the Duke of Cambridge became a patron of following his visits to Lewa, said: 'There are real alarm bells ringing.

'It is Kenya's economic assets that are also being hit, not just the animals.'

The WWF estimates that there are currently around 4,838 black rhinos, most of them in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya.  Fifty years ago, there were 70,000.
