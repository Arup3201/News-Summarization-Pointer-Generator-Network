She wrote: 'This doesn't seem real, Ro. I wish it wasn't happening.

'I can't get my head round that my special little sister has gone.

'I am going to miss that massive smile that would light up anywhere with those big eyes which let us know how you were feeling.

'You were tired, weren't you Ro?

'Those gorgeous eyes lost their glow, but no more pain and no more fighting, now it's time for you to be free.

'An angel sent to our family, a sister I never thought I would ever have.

'Our house is never going to be the same again. Love you so much Rosie Mc.

'Look down on us all, especially on our mum and dad.

'Goodnight, God bless. - Your Coleen xxx.'

sit on your knee.

'Days out with Nanny and Grandad aren't going to be as special because you're not going to be with us.

can't wait to tell my little brother about you. Get ready to catch my 
balloons because there's going to be loads getting sent up to Heaven. 
Your little mate Kai.'

'I will never forget the way you laughed and those big beautiful eyes. You are an inspiration to me.

'God has called for you, so we have to let you go, so take your eyes and that big smile and make Heaven glow.

'You will always have a special place in my heart. Love you always and forever. - Your Wayne.'

According to the NHS Rett syndrome is a
neurological disorder that affects just one in 12,000 females and

'You may not have walked like you should have done. You may not have talked like you should have done.

'Sometimes the anger and the pain shone through in your frustrated cries.

'Rosie, we are sorry we had no miracles to give you or a magic wand to wave, all that we could give you was Love and Faith.

'But when you smiled we could see the beautiful little girl who lived in your eyes.

'Love you forever, Mum and Dad xxxx.'
