What took us so long? We had lived together for 20 years. We were soulmates, best friends, inseparable, Darby and Joan.

Anyone
 observing my partner, Julia, and I together, so at ease with each 
other, sharing so many interests - from drinking fine wine to long walks
 in the sun - would have said we were prime candidates for matrimony, a 
wedding waiting to happen.

Yet something stalled the inevitable, and 
kept on stalling it. Until now. Two weeks ago, Julia and I, with more 
than 120 years on the clock between us, walked down the aisle. So what 
took us so long?

Partly it was the caution born of experience. We had
 both been married before, for 13 years apiece.

When you have learnt the
 hard way that marriage is no guarantee of living happily ever after, 
you hesitate before taking the plunge again.

Partly, also, it was 
simple logistics. I am English and Julia is Australian, so we could not 
have married in one hemisphere without disappointing loved ones in the 
other.

As the long years passed, compromises were pondered. Once we 
found ourselves on a Greek island, outside a church, and toyed with 
getting married then and there and telling people when we got home. Some
 couples take that route.

But mainly, if I am honest, it was apathy. 
Why bother? Why go to all the trouble and expense of organising a 
ceremony whose significance, as we saw it, would be largely symbolic?

Neither
 of us was religious. Neither of us was minded to view marriage as a 
solemn sacrament. We could not muster the enthusiasm to take a step that
 did not seem particularly momentous. And we were not alone in our 
apathy.

Happy day: The couple loved taking centre stage as bride and groom

For in largely secular 21st-century Britain, nobody seems to 
mind whether couples are married.

Some people tie the knot, some don't, 
just as some people smoke and some don't. And with more and more women 
retaining their maiden names after marriage, and the wearing of rings 
becoming ever more haphazard, there is often no way of telling if Bob 
and Wendy are Mr and Mrs or Mr and Ms.

Before, we had just been two people in the crowd. Now we 
were the bride and groom, the centre of attention, principal actors in 
an age-old drama which society invested with profound significance

Fifty years ago, people might 
have tut-tutted and told us we were living in sin. Friends would have 
taken me aside and urged me to make an honest woman of Julia.

Nowadays 
there is no such peer pressure because so many couples have taken the 
same course as us. In the latest census figures, the number of unmarried
 adults in the UK has crept ahead of the number of married ones for the 
first time.

One friend did urge me to get married, but only to save 
money in death duties. There has been not a murmur of disapproval at our
 living arrangements. We were 'partners', and happy with that 
designation.

Signing the register: But Max now knows being married is about more than just a piece of paper

So why now? I would like to say it was the result of 
long, hard thought, but nothing could be further from the truth. When I 
proposed to Julia - on holiday in France this summer - it was more 
impulsive than premeditated. I simply suggested that, as we were flying 
out to Australia for a wedding in November, we might as well get married
 ourselves while we were out there. She agreed, in the same 
matter-of-fact spirit.

It was typical of our approach to life - simple, easy, calm. But there was nothing calm or matter-of-fact about what followed.

The
 prospect of marriage, and arranging our wedding, had a galvanising 
effect. To the settled routine of our lives, it brought a sense of 
soaring excitement that neither of us had foreseen.

As we sketched 
out our plans - a small wedding in Julia's birthplace of Melbourne, 
followed by a big party in our home town of Oxford - and took others 
into our confidence, we realised that we were surfing a tsunami of 
goodwill.

Before, we had just been two people in the crowd. Now we 
were the bride and groom, the centre of attention, principal actors in 
an age-old drama which society invested with profound significance.

The
 first people we told were my two daughters from my first marriage, now 
grown up. 'I never saw this one coming,' gasped the elder daughter. Her 
sister let out a great yodel of excitement.

The reaction of our 
friends was equally heartwarming. We composed a round-robin email, 
pressed send and waited gleefully for the explosion.

Did the fact that we were 30 years older 
than the other couple in the shop, who were also buying a ring, make us 
feel self-conscious? Not a bit

Some explosion!
 The excited phone calls, the tears, the whoops of joy, the clamour for 
more details.

'How good that you have finally decided to join the 
Establishment,' emailed one old friend, Lionel, who had just celebrated 
his silver wedding anniversary. The tone was ironic but not the 
sentiment.

In free-and-easy 2013, married couples do not exactly feel
 beleaguered, but they do vaguely worry that they are an endangered 
species, fuddy-duddy in their attitudes. For Lionel, as for other 
married friends, our decision to join the club was not just a cause for 
celebration but a validation of their own lifestyle.

As we threw 
ourselves into planning the wedding, we not only found ourselves smiling
 and giggling like a couple half our age, but realised how much pleasure
 we were giving others.

Our postman chortled when he heard the news. 
The local newsagent beamed his delight. Neighbours stopped us in the 
street to congratulate us. It was if we suddenly possessed a magic aura.
 At the jewellers where we bought the ring, they insisted on serving us 
bubbly at ten in the morning.

Did the fact that we were 30 years older 
than the other couple in the shop, who were also buying a ring, make us 
feel self-conscious? Not a bit of it. Marriage makes no discrimination 
on grounds of age. We were embarking on the same journey as the other 
couple and enjoying the same following wind - the good wishes of people,
 young and old, who thirst for a love story with a happy ending.

Paradise: Max has discovered being husband and wife is better than being just partners (posed by models)

I 
dusted off my old suit, and Julia started shopping for a suitably funky 
wedding dress. All low-key by some people's standards, but we felt 
simultaneously self-conscious and quietly proud.

The chorus of 
congratulations was still ringing in our ears when we boarded the plane 
for Melbourne. There were still arrangements to be finalised. We had 
found a venue with an appropriately British feel but not briefed the 
celebrant, the florist, the harpist, the chef, the sommelier or the rest
 of the supporting cast.

It was all pretty hectic and, having 
promised friends in England we would make a video, we had to rush around
 taking shots of kangaroos, surfers and barbecues to prove we’d married 
in Australia and not the Home Counties.

Organising even a small 
wedding - ours was just 15 guests - involves so much time, trouble and 
expense that you can see why some couples are put off the idea. But we 
were buoyed by so much goodwill that the days before the wedding flew by
 in a happy blur.

The warmth of our welcome Down Under at least 
matched the enthusiasm in England. Julia's 90-year-old mother was 
thrilled for us. So were all her other relatives. As the big day loomed 
and guests started to gather, I felt such boyish excitement. Outside I 
may have looked like an old fuddy-duddy, inside I was a teenager again. 
SHE, in all her elegance and beauty, was marrying ME!

Vintage vows

Britain’s longest wedded couple are Karam and Kartari Chand, from Bedford, who have been married for 86 years

The most 
electrifying moment came shortly before the wedding. Of our guests, all 
Australian, I was told I had met everyone except Garry, husband of one 
of Julia's old university friends. 'You'll like Garry,' Julia assured 
me.

Like him? I loved him! 'Garry' turned out to be a cunning 
disguise for my sister Claire who, unbeknown to me, had flown ten 
thousand miles to be there.

As I stared at her in amazement, I could 
feel tears welling up in my eyes. And they welled up again later as I 
intoned those ancient vows: '. . . for richer for poorer . . . in 
sickness and in health... so long as we both shall live . . .'

Julia 
looked me in the eyes. I looked her in the eyes. The celebrant 
pronounced us husband and wife. Guests applauded. Cameras clicked. What 
had we done? It was certainly not something trivial or ephemeral. It 
reverberated like thunder across the room.

The day after the wedding,
 we strolled along the beach. After the giddy emotions of the day 
before, it was a time for sober reflection.

How will marriage affect 
our relationship? Will we be less inclined to take each other for 
granted? Or more inclined? For simply by making such a public 
commitment, we have altered the landscape of our lives.

Cynics would say that nothing has changed. Somehow I hope we can prove the cynics wrong.

A month ago we were mere partners. Now we are husband and wife. It feels like a promotion.
