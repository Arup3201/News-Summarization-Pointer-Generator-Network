Ed Miliband called up two of Gordon Brown’s backroom bruisers to the political front line yesterday in a Shadow Cabinet reshuffle designed to beef up his attacks on the Tories.

Tom Watson – who led a campaign to expose the News of the World phone-hacking scandal – will become deputy party chairman in charge of a new campaigns attack unit.

In a sign Labour is failing to land significant political punches, he will be joined by Michael Dugher – a former Brown spin doctor who becomes Shadow Minister without Portfolio.

Ed Miliband has turned to one of 'Brown's bruisers', tom Watson, to be deputy party chairman

The Labour leader’s decision to create a Brownite cabal at the top of the party overshadowed the elevation of rising stars such as Chuka Umunna, the business spokesman; Rachel Reeves, the new Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury; and Liz Kendall, who will speak on care and pensioner issues.

The reshuffle left the most senior posts unchanged. Husband and wife team Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper remain Shadow Chancellor and Shadow Home Secretary respectively, while Douglas Alexander retains his position as Shadow Foreign Secretary.

But in a painful admission that his party has failed to land meaningful blows against the Coalition’s NHS shake-up, Mr Miliband moved former health secretary Andy Burnham back to his old policy patch. He replaces John Healey, who has returned to the backbenches.

And in a signal that Mr Burnham had left Education Secretary Michael Gove to grab the credit for Labour’s academy schools programme, Blairite former schools minister Stephen Twigg was given the key education job.

Rosie Winterton: Shadow Chief Whip

Yesterday’s front-bench reshuffle was
billed by Labour bosses as the moment the ‘new generation’ of MPs were 
promoted – with five of those winning promotion to Mr Miliband’s top 
team having been elected for the first time last year. But it also saw 
Mr Miliband hand top jobs to Mr Brown’s toughest henchmen.

Mr Watson was best known until recently as a prime mover in the Curry House plot that helped to oust Tony Blair.

He and Mr Dugher were also friends 
with Damian McBride, the former Brown spin doctor who resigned in 
disgrace after unleashing ‘the forces of hell’ in negative briefings 
against political friend and foe alike.

One Labour insider said yesterday: ‘These are not the forces of hell, they are the friends of the forces of hell.’

Last night Mr Watson was embroiled in
fresh controversy after he refused to quit his role on the Culture 
Select Committee, from where he grilled  News Corporation boss Rupert 
Murdoch over phone-hacking.

Committee chairman John Whittingdale 
called for him to stand down, but Mr Watson pointed out that Tory deputy
chairman Michael Fallon is still a member of the Treasury Committee.

Jon Trickett, another member of the 
Brown inner circle, who was his parliamentary private secretary, was 
also promoted to the Shadow Cabinet and becomes a Shadow Minister for 
the Cabinet Office.

He is expected to take a more 
conciliatory stance with the trade unions over this autumn’s planned 
national strikes than Blairite Tessa Jowell, whose job was downgraded 
yesterday. She is now only spokesman for London and the Olympics. 
Caroline Flint was moved from communities spokesman to energy spokesman –
one of 11 women out of the 27 in the new-look top team.

Deputy leader Harriet Harman swapped 
the international development brief for culture, media and sport. She 
exchanges jobs with Ivan Lewis, who provoked ridicule by suggesting at 
Labour’s conference that journalists should be ‘struck off’.

Mr Miliband said: ‘My decision to 
appoint half a dozen members of the 2010 intake shows the talent Labour 
has and the way in which this new generation can join us in taking 
Labour’s agenda forward.’

He said Mr Watson had ‘performed a 
service for the country over phone-hacking’ and said ‘it’s right that he
stays on the select committee’.

But Tory Party chairman Baroness 
Warsi said: ‘By promoting Gordon Brown’s cronies, the very people who 
got us into this mess in the first place, it’s clear that Ed Miliband is
a weak leader who has learnt nothing.’
