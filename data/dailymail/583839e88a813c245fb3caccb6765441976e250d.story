Aussie rapper 360 has been inundated with angry messages following his controversial statements about the Australian flag - but stands by his claims that the flag is now 'identified with racism'.

The ARIA-award winner rapper, also known as Matt Colwell, took to social media to defend the comments he made on ABC program Q&A on Monday night.

He used Facebook and Twitter to respond to his critics on Tuesday, before announcing that in the wake of the online furore, he is stepping away from social media.

'Thanks to everyone who's showing me support. You don't actually know how much just a tweet means. I'm getting off social media for a while.' 

He denies accusations that he has disrespected Australia's servicemen – but reaffirmed his beliefs that 'the (Australian) flag doesn't represent the same values that it used to.'

'I think those who fought under the flag for this country would be ashamed of the racism under the guise of patriotism in Australia,' Colwell wrote on his Facebook page.

Aussie rapper 360, aka Matt Colwell, stood by his controversial comments on social media on Tuesday, before announcing he will 'get off social media for a while' after being inundated with hateful messages

Colwell asked people to 'settle down and stop getting offended,' explaining he has been 'copping it from all angles' since making his comments.

The 28-year-old from Melbourne made his initial comments on Q&A whilst responding to a question about the how Australians are perceived internationally.

The rapper answered, 'there are so many racist bigots in this country and they're everywhere.'

Colwell explained that he associates the Australian flag with racist behaviour, which is taking place in Australia 'under the guise of patriotism'.

'I identify (the flag) with racism, don't you?' he asked the ABC studio audience. 

360's Facebook page has been inundated from people disagreeing with the controversial statements he made about the Australian flag on Monday

He has explained that there is nothing wrong with being proud of your country, but described how the Australian flag is increasingly being used in racist situations under the veil of 'Aussie Pride'. 

'On Australia Day you see a bunch of dudes walking around with their tops on… getting on the drink… and they've got an Australian flag wrapped around their neck,' Colwell explained on Q&A.'I've seen it, yelling "get out of the country, this isn't your country".

'I've seen it so much, growing up and still today. It's pathetic.'

On Tuesday, Colwell used social media to elaborate on his perspective and respond directly to angry critics.

He clarified that his comments were not about all Australians - just the individuals who behave in a racist manner. 

'I can see I've offended some of you with my statements…,' he wrote.

'If ur not a racist I was not referring to you (sic).'

'Unfortunately the actions of other have made me see the flag in a negative way,' Colwell posted on Twitter.

Colwell took to Facebook to clarify his views, after making his comments on ABC show Q&A on Monday

'By no means does, it make u racist for being a proud australian, It sucks that someone repping the flag has a negative connotation to me now.'

Colwell responded to accusations that his comments were disrespectful to the ex-servicemen who fought in wars under the Australian flag.

'No one fought for the actual flag, they fought to keep our country free and democracy and not for the racist bigoted place it's become,' he argued on Facebook.

'I think those who fought under the flag for this country would be ashamed of the racism under the guise of patriotism in Australia.'

' I would never disrespect the diggers. I appreciate all they did for our country but I feel the flag has been re appropriated and doesn't represent the same values as it used to.

He also spoke on triple j drive to 'clear the air'.

'What I'm saying is, it's a shame that now when I do see an Australian flag, if I see someone parading an Australian flag, I'm cautious of that person.

'I automatically think in my head this person could be racist, they might not be as well. I'm not saying everyone is.'

Members of the public took to Twitter to criticise Colwell for his comments, arguing that he has been disrespectful to the Australian servicemen

After receiving a torrent of hate on social media, Colwell clarified that he was not saying this behaviour was typical of all Australians.

'People just need to settle down and stop getting offended, I'm not talking about every single Australian in the country...I'm just saying that it's a shame for me that that's how it goes.'

Colwell said that he has received both 'support and backlash' since voicing his views.

On Facebook, many lashed out, explaining how offended they are by his comments.

'Your comments were highly insulting. My father and forefathers fought under the Australian Flag- they fought for this country yes, but swore allegiance to the flag. I am sick to death of Australians being called racists for being patriotic!' one member of the public wrote.

Colwell engaged with his critics, responding to their questions, before announcing he will be 'stepping away' from social media for a while

'I feel sorry for him... it must feel awful to be embarrassed to live under a flag that so many men died for,' another commented.

'You have a narrow minded perception of what the Australian flag means, it stands for much more than just what the few use it for,' a Facebook user wrote.

'Calling the flag or people who fly it as racists is about as dumb as saying all Muslims are terrorists ..

'There is a minority of racists amongst the flag flyers the rest are patriots.'

Others have voiced their support of Colwell's comments about the misuse of the Australian flag.

'Good on you for saying something a lot of proud Aussies think: that our flag and the southern cross are used by ignorant racists to show their 'patriotism'.'

'I'm 100% behind what you said. You weren't saying the flag is racist but there are idiots who use the flag as a racist nationalist symbol,' another person commented.

During the program, Colwell explained that he does not want racist fans to attend his concerts. 

'In hip-hop there's a lot of racist people … I don't want those people at my shows. I don't want anything to do with them.' 

360’s third album Utopia – the follow-up to 2011’s platinum-selling Falling and Flying – has been nominated for an ARIA for Best Urban Album.
