We are not shy about our love of a bearded man on the Femail pages at MailOnline.

From Mr Incredibeard to the flame-haired John Lewis model, boys with facial fuzz are floating our boat right now, and so when these pictures of Jigsaw's latest campaign landed on our desk we paid attention.

Then while we were busy planning our boyfriend/husband/GBF's new winter wardrobes we noticed that the supremely handsome model featured in the countryside shoot looked a tad familiar.

Hello again Noah Huntley! The actor is the face of Jigsaw's autumn/winter menswear campaign (Noah is pictured wearing Wool Gingham Jacket, £240, and Trousers, £110)

Hello again Noah Huntley! Always handsome, the baby-faced soap crush of our Nineties has now morphed into a jaw-droppingly hot male model just perfect to showcase the British brand's heritage style.

Noah, 39, played the big-haired unlucky in love Luke McAllister for several years in the 'dales before heading down to London to take on the role of a charming doctor on Holby City.

Now sporting a thick blonde mop, grizzly beard and sexily creased face the actor, who spends his time between homes in London and LA, is fronting Jigsaw's new season menswear fashion.

Blonde Noah played hearthrob Luke McAllister in Emmerdale during the Nineties and may have used some of his farmyard training on the Jigsaw shoot

The shoot took place on Ministry of Defence training land in the summer (Noah is pictured wearing Bomber Jacket, £195, Roll Neck Jumper £85, Cotton Twill Trousers £89)

The autumn/winter shoot took place on Ministry of Defence training land and Noah's Emmerdale experience would have been great practise for staying cool and looking hot while battling the elements and posing with ponies.

Featuring the best of British fabrics and manufacturing the collection includes washed Harris Tweed made in the UK, Sanders brogues, a Camridge Satchel, lush velvets, the brand's signature tartan, elbow patches and Alpaca wool in the knitwear.

Menswear design director Frances Walker took inspiration from artists Mark Rothko and Sean Scully and invented a new colour for the season, a dark rusty 'squirrel' designed to be worn in rich, dark shirts and roll-necks.

Key pieces include oversized 
patchwork and cable knit jumpers which we can see ourselves snuggling into, a patchwork suit (made from offcuts 
from a family-run Italian mill) that will make any man look cool and a beautiful 
double-faced trench coat that Noah should wear while accompanying us on a romantic city break. We can dream.
