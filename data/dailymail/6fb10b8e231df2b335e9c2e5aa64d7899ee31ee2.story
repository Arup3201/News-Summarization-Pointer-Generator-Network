Prince Harry has been pictured on a late-night snack run to fast-food chicken chain Nando's.

The royal was spotted at the restaurant outlet in Fulham, following England's World Cup qualification against Poland on Tuesday night.

According to onlookers, a casually dressed Harry - wearing baseball cap, jeans and T-shirt - ordered a chicken breast fillet in lemon and herb sauce, cheese, and a side order of mashed potato.

He also ordered a double chicken breast wrap with medium spice and chips, the Daily Mirror reports.

The bill came to around £24, staff said. 

The prince apparently placed the order at around 11.50pm, and spent the next few minutes playing with his mobile phone. 

He was joined by a friend and his 
personal security team at the restaurant until they picked up the order 
shortly after midnight and left, exiting through a car park.

It is not the first time the prince has been spotted at Nando's. In 2009, he was spotted at an outlet in Stevenage alongside his army colleagues.

Harry was clearly looking to burn off some of the calories today as he took to the rugby pitch to put some young players through their paces at Twickenham.

Working off the calories: Prince Harry joined a rugby union coaching session at Twickenham Stadium today

The Patron of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) All Schools Programme delivered a training session alongside RFU coaching staff on the Rugby pitch, before heading inside the stadium to meet young people

The fourth in line to the throne is a man of many talents, as he is a qualified rugby coach, and he was challenged to show his talent by England World Cup winner Jason
Robinson, who joked that the prince could be in line for a call-up to 
the national squad.

But Harry, 29, replied: 'I think I'm a bit past it already.'

The All Schools programme aims to 
expand rugby into 750 state schools as part of the legacy of England 
hosting the 2015 World Cup.

Robinson,
who went to state schools in Leeds and represented Great Britain at 
rugby league before switching codes and captaining the England rugby 
union side, gave Harry a pair of the same type of white and red boots he
wore as an international to take part in the coaching session on 
Twickenham's hallowed turf.

'I can't guarantee that they'll get you into the England team but you'll go quick,' said Robinson.

Changing into the boots, Harry stripped off his tracksuit and put his expensive designer watch inside a training shoe.

'No one's going to nick my watch?' he asked an aide, before having second thoughts and handing it to him for safekeeping.

'Keep an eye on that one,' he said cheekily gesturing toward Robinson.

After the game Robinson, looking over at the Prince , said: 'He's dripping with sweat. He's put everything into this'

Despite his admission that he was 'past it', Harry put on an energetic and athletic display while joining in the game

On the pitch, the pair trained groups of boys and girls from schools around the country. 'Pass the ball, pass,' shouted Harry. 'Get Jason. Seriously, I'm knackered.'

He has too many other commitments these days to be able to play the game regularly.

Robinson, looking over at the Prince later, said: 'He's dripping with sweat. He's put everything into this.'

Asked about Harry's admission that he was past it, the England hero said: 'I must admit he was blowing on a few occasions. He was heading for the water.'
