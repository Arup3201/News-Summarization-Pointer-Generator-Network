A lesbian who buried her lover's ex-girlfriend alive in a shallow grave sent a chilling letter to the victim's mother in which she wrote: 'I f****** murdered your 20-year-old mistake... she deserved it.'

Ashley Barber admitted brutally beating 20-year-old Ohio college student Brandy Stevens-Rosine  before burying her in woods behind her home in Crawford County, Pa.

Barber, 21, switched her plea from not guilty after her accomplice, Nichole Olmstead, 20, admitted her part in the 2012 killing. Both have been sentenced to life in prison.

Following her guilty plea details of 
the case were released to the public for the first time including the 
note sent to  Stevens-Rosine's mother, Carrie Stevens-Rosine.

Barber
told a hearing at Crawford County Court last week: 'I don’t have much 
to say -- I have no explanation. You may not believe me, but I do 
apologize.'

Miss Stevens-Rosine studied sociology at Youngstown State University near her hometown in Beaver Township, Ohio.

Her
friend Krysti Horvat described her as 'like the little sister that 
everyone would want to have', and said her tragic death was 
'unfathomable'.

The student was apparently still devoted to her ex-girlfriend Olmstead and had shown herself willing to run errands for her.

On
May 17, she drove 75 miles to Wayne Township, Pennsylvania to visit 
Olmstead at the house where she was living with her new lover, 
20-year-old Barber.

The 
house, owned by Barber's parents, is apparently located deep in the 
woods, making Miss Stevens-Rosine nervous as she approached her 
destination.

She texted a friend to say she had a 'funny feeling' - and that was the last anyone heard of her.

When
she met up with Olmstead and Barber, they took her into the woods and 
told her they wanted to show her a fort they had built.

Instead, they started punching her and stuffed a hat in her mouth branded with images from graphic horror movie Saw.

After
Miss Stevens-Rosine had fallen to the ground, Barber apparently 
strangled her with a rope while her lover attacked her with a shovel.

Following
several blows to the head, according to Olmstead, the attackers could 
see their victim's brains sticking out of her wounds.

They then allegedly headbutted her and bashed her head against a tree stump.

The killers had prepared a shallow grave for Miss Stevens-Rosine, police said, and rolled her nearly lifeless body into it.

But when they realised that she was still alive, they smashed in her face with a rock and poured water into her nose and mouth.

Barber
apparently said she had done this because 'her worst fear was being 
buried alive' so she wanted to make sure the victim was dead.

Two
days after the assault, Miss Stevens-Rosine's family reported her 
missing - but police did not suspect foul play, owing to the young 
woman's age.

Miss Horvat had been told the address her friend was planning to visit, so went with Brandy's family to Wayne to look for her.

After
speaking to locals - including Olmstead and Barber - they could not 
find the young woman, until police located her cell phone signal and 
tracked down her car to Barber's house.

The
body of Miss Stevens-Rosine was found on May 23, and the next day her 
alleged killers were arrested and arraigned on charges of criminal 
homicide, conspiracy and tampering with physical evidence.

Olmstead had reportedly written in a notebook that the crime 'is perfect,' and 'I don't believe we will ever get caught.'

She also asked herself the question: 'Do I feel guilty?', to which she answered, 'no, not an ounce. I am proud.'

Sentencing
Barber to life in prison without parole Judge Mark Stevens, said: 'The 
punishment dictated by the law fits. We have to protect society.'

Stevens-Rosine's
mother, Carrie Stevens-Rosine, told The Huffington Post; 'Nothing will 
bring my daughter back and why this had to happen to my daughter we will
never understand.'
