Tottenham have completed the £8million signing of Sevilla centre back Federico Fazio on a four-year deal.

The 27-year-old Argentinian  arrives at White Hart Lane after a deal for Villareal defender Mateo Musacchio fell through over third-party ownership issues.

Speaking to the club's official website, Fazio said: 'I’m really happy to be here at this club, this great club with very good players. I’m really happy to be here.

Capped twice at international level, Fazio, who stands at 6ft 4in, helped Sevilla win the Europa League last season.

The defender is the fifth defensive signing for Spurs this summer after the arrivals of Michel Vorm, Ben Davies, DeAndre Yedlin and Eric Dier.

The move comes after club captain Michael Dawson completed his switch to Hull City.
