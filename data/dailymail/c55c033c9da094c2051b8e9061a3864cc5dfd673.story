Ndamukong Suh’s wish appears to have come true, with the Miami Dolphins set to make him the NFL’s highest-paid defensive player.

After the Lions declined to use the franchise tag on Suh to save $26.5m of cap space, the Dolphins look to have beaten Oakland, Jacksonville, Indianapolis and San Diego to the most coveted signature in this year’s free agency.

Suh will on Tuesday sign a $114million, six-year deal with around $60m guaranteed, ESPN report. With no state taxes in Florida, the deal dwarfs JJ Watt’s current six-year, $100m deal which the Texans’ defensive end penned last year. 

Ndamukong Suh will on Tuesday sign a $114million with the Miami Dolphins with $60million guaranteed 

Suh, the second pick of the 2010 draft, is a four time Pro-Bowler and three-time first team All-Pro and led the Lions with 8.5 sacks last season.

At 28, Suh is in his prime and is a once-in-a decade type of player whom the Dolphins can build their franchise around. A fearsome pass rusher, he was the cornerstone of NFL’s best rushing defense and helped the Lions to the play-offs last year.

He will join the likes of Cameron Wake and Oliver Vernon in an aggressive front four.

In his five years in Detroit, Suh played 80 out of 82 games. He was suspended for both of those for stamping on Evan Dietrich-Smith of the Green Bay Packers in 2011.

Following his exit, the focus for the Lions front office will be getting fellow defensive tackle Nick Fairley to stay. After declining his fifth-year option last year due to injury concerns, the 26-year-old is considered the second-best free agent defensive tackle.

Should Suh depart, which appears likely, they will need a run-stuffer alongside him.

The free-spending Dolphins had a roster clear-out which paved the way for Suh’s arrival. Veterans such as Brian Hartline, Brandon Gibson, Dannell Ellerbe and Cortland Finnegan were among those released to free up cap space.

Suh and the Dolphins travel to London later on this year to play the New York Jets on October 4 in the first International Series game of the 2015 season.
