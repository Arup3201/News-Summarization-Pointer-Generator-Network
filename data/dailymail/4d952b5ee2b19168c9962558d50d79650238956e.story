A thug who tried to kill a shop-owner by fire-bombing his takeaway has been jailed nine years in prison for attempted murder.

Archibald McKay, 46, from Possil, Glasgow, was convicted of attempting to murder 34-year-old Rashid Ali at the Spicy Bite in Saracen Street, Glasgow, on August 27, last year.

The terrifying attack came after he had already previously been jailed for threatening to burn the shop down and had waged a campaign of fear against the businessman

McKay appeared in court on a charge of assault to injury, danger of life and attempted murder with 'an ignited bottle containing fuel'

The High Court in Glasgow heard that McKay was standing outside the shop with a bottle in his hand and there were flames coming from the bottle.

Brave Mr Ali managed to prevent the bottle of burning fuel from being thrown inside the shop where he worked during the incident.

The heroic worker tackled his attacker and as they wrestled to the ground the bottle fell.

It then exploded into a fireball which engulfed McKay, Mr Ali's car and a nearby telephone box.

A fire expert said that if McKay had 
succeeded in firebombing the shop the consequences could have been 
'catastrophic' as there was only one way in and out of the shop.

The ambush was captured on CCTV cameras and during the trial the jury was played the horrific footage.

Prior to the murder bid McKay was jailed for threatening to burn down Mr Ali's takeaway

McKay appeared in court on a charge of assault to injury, danger of life and attempted murder with 'an ignited bottle containing fuel'.

He claimed that it wasn't him in the CCTV clip and denied having anything to do with the murder bid.

Jailing McKay Lady Scott told him: 'You took part in a campaign of violence against Mr Ali.

'On occasions you took food from his premises without paying.

'Your presence always carried menace towards Mr Ali.'

Lady Scott added: 'Mr Ali has been left frightened and has lost his business.'

Prior to the murder bid McKay was jailed for threatening to burn down Mr Ali's takeaway and was jailed at Glasgow Sheriff Court.

McKay was out on licence for that offence when he decided to torch the premises.

John Dunn, Procurator Fiscal of West of Scotland, said: 'This was a despicable act of violence which potentially could have carried with it far more serious consequences but for the presence of mind of the victim, Mr Ali, in thwarting his attacker's attempt to throw a bottle of burning fuel into his shop.

'The sentence imposed today properly reflects the views of the majority of people in our communities who want to live their lives free of the threat of violence, this type of conduct will not be tolerated.'
