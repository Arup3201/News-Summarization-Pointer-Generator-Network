The seven-week Gaza conflict halted last night, but now Israel faces attacks on another front after Al-Qaeda's Syrian wing the Nusra Front and the Western-backed Free Syrian Army seized control of the crossing between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

It was a fierce battle with President Bashar Assad's forces that left 20 government soldiers and four rebels dead, and an Israeli officer wounded.

The capture of the Quneitra crossing on Syria's de facto border in the Golan - the only official crossing between Syria and Israel - held more symbolic value than strategic, but rebels said it would provide relief to nearby villages that were under siege by government troops.

'Al-Nusra Front and other rebel groups took the Quneitra crossing, and heavy fighting with the Syrian army is continuing in the surrounding area,' said Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Rebel fighters captured the Syrian side of the sole crossing over the armistice line on Wednesday morning in a deadly battle with government troops.

Stray mortar fire into the Golan left an Israeli officer moderately wounded, with the army saying that it immediately launched a counter-attack. 

'In response to the errant fire from the internal fighting in Syria, which hit Israel earlier today and injured an IDF (Israel Defence Forces) officer, the IDF just targeted two Syrian army positions in the Syrian Golan Heights. Hits were confirmed,' it said in a statement. 

This afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told AFP: 'From what we know, opposition forces overran the Syrian regime forces on the Syrian side of the Quneitra crossing, some of those including the Al-Nusra Front, which ultimately leave the crossing in the opposition forces' hands.'

'We have declared a closed military zone in the immediate area of the crossing and the roads leading to it. We are prepared for any potential spillover effect into Israel,' he said. 

'The opposition forces including the Al-Nusra Front have been on the border area for some time now, but this is not necessarily an increased threat (to Israel),

'These forces have said multiple times that when they are done with Syria, they will head to Israel. Their hands are tied up in Syria at the moment, so we have to be prepared for that development.'

Earlier the army said it had responded by hitting two Syrian army posts.

As a result of the fighting on the Syrian-controlled side of the plateau, the level of alert was raised on the Israeli side, a spokeswoman said, without confirming that it had been increased to the highest level.

On Sunday, at least five rockets hit the Israeli-occupied side of the plateau, all of which were due to stray fire, the army said.

In June, an Israeli teenager was killed in a deliberate cross-border attack, which prompted Israeli warplanes to attack Syrian military headquarters and positions.

Israel, which is technically at war with Syria, seized 1,200 square kilometres (460 square miles) of the Golan Heights during the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community.

Since the Syrian conflict erupted in 2011, the plateau has been tense, with a growing number of rockets and mortar rounds hitting the Israeli side, mostly stray, prompting occasional armed responses.

The armistice line is patrolled by a UN peacekeeping force. that has been increasingly depleted by the withdrawal of contributing nations' troops in the face of the persistent fire.

The Philippines said Saturday it would repatriate its 331-strong contingent in the UN Disengagement Observer Force mirroring previous moves by Australia, Croatia and Japan. 

Israel has avoided taking sides in the war, but has responded when the violence has spilled across the border. 

Gen. Ibrahim Jbawi, the spokesman for the Free Syrian Army's southern front, confirmed the rebel gains, as did the Local Coordination Committees activist group. 

Kenan Mohammed, a spokesman for the Western-backed Syrian opposition, said rebels aimed to push Assad's troops from all of Quneitra. He also said opposition forces posed no threat to Israel.

'Our aim isn't Israel right now, and we in the FSA haven't targeted Israeli lands,' he said, adding that the rebels' focus is on Assad and the extremist Islamic State group. 'The matter of Israel - it's not for now, and it's more political.'

As the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel continues many people who fled their homes in Rafa in southern Gaza return to their homes as a result of the truce 

Both Israel's Prime Minister and Hamas have declared victory in the Gaza war, though their competing claims left questions over the future of their uneasy ceasefire.

Benjamin Netanyahu's comments, delivered in a prime-time address on national television, appeared aimed at countering critics of the war, with both hard-liners in his governing coalition and residents of rocket-scarred southern Israel saying the war was a failure because it did not halt Hamas's rocket attacks or oust the group from power.

Masked Hamas militants carrying heavy weapons gave their own address upon the rubble of one destroyed Gaza neighbourhood, though their own major demands will not be addressed until indirect talks with Israel begin again in Cairo.

Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce yesterday, with each side settling for an ambiguous interim agreement in exchange for a period of calm. 

One of the final Israeli acts of the two-month long conflict was an airstrike on the 15-storey Basha Tower in Gaza city which was one of the tallest buildings in the region

Now that the fighting as stopped, civilians in Palestinian civilians are beginning the task of assessing the damage caused by the heavy Israeli bombardment 

Due to the difficulty of securing supplies of concrete and blocks in Gaza, Palestinian civilians have had to improvise methods of repairing their damaged homes 

Hamas, though badly battered, remains in control of Gaza with part of its military arsenal intact. Israel and Egypt will continue to control access to blockaded Gaza, despite Hamas's long-running demand that the border closures imposed in 2007 be lifted.

Hamas is seeking an end to the Israeli blockade, including the reopening of Gaza's sea and airport. It also wants Egypt to reopen its Rafah border crossing, the territory's main gateway to the outside world. Under the restrictions, virtually all of Gaza's 1.8 million people cannot trade or travel. Only a few thousand are able to leave the coastal territory every month.

Israel, meanwhile, wants Hamas to be disarmed.

'Hamas was hit hard and it received not one of the demands it set forth for a ceasefire, not one,' Mr Netanyahu said. He said Israel 'will not tolerate' any more rocket fire, and would respond 'even harder' if the attacks resume.

Addressing the future of Gaza, the Israeli premier that should Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas 'choose peace' he would be happy for the Palestinian leader to regain control of the coastal enclave, which the Islamic militant group Hamas has ruled since it routed Mr Abbas's forces in 2007. Mr Netanyahu indicated that as long as Hamas was in power, reaching a negotiated solution to the conflict with the Palestinians was impossible. 

Other people have been forced to salvage their belongings from their badly damaged homes which have cannot be repaired 

Some of the people face an uncertain future as they try and save as many of their possessions which were not destroyed during the repeated attacks 

In Gaza, masked militants gathered on the rubble of destroyed homes in the Shijaiyah neighbourhood, site of some of the heaviest fighting, to declare victory. The men displayed heavy machine guns, mortar shells, rockets and anti-tank missiles. Hundreds of residents gathered around the militants, taking pictures with them and their weapons.

Abu Obeida, a spokesman for the Hamas military wing, stood over an Israeli flag as he addressed the crowd.

'Gaza achieved victory because it has done what major armies failed to do. It forced the enemy to retreat,' he said. 'We must know that no voice is louder than the voice of the resistance.'

Life slowly returned to normal in Gaza today, as traffic policemen took up their positions in streets overwhelmed by vehicles transporting thousands of people back to the homes they had abandoned during the fighting. Harried utility crews struggled to repair electricity and water infrastructure damaged by weeks of Israeli airstrikes.

'We are going back today,' said farmer Radwan al-Sultan, 42, as he and some of his seven children used an overloaded three-wheeled tuk-tuk to return to their home in the hard-hit northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. 'Finally we will enjoy our home sweet home again.'

The United Nations' said the number of displaced people had decreased significantly. UNRWA, the UN Palestinian refugee agency, said about 53,000 people are still living in shelters, down from almost 290,000 on Tuesday. 

With the threat of Israeli bombardment at an end, heavily armed groups of Palestinian resistance factions try and reassert their authority on the streets
