Rupert Murdoch has backtracked on Twitter after making a controversial series of tweets in the wake of last week's Paris attacks.

The media mogul sparked outrage on Friday after saying all Muslims should be held responsible for the actions of jihadists. 

On Wednesday Murdoch took to Twitter once again but this time attempted to walk back from his comments which had caused controversy days before in the wake of three days of terrorist atrocities in Paris.

'Certainly did not mean all Muslims responsible for Paris attack, ' he tweeted. 'But Muslim community must debate and confront extremism.'

Two minutes later he tweeted again: 'Ten of thousands of jihadi victims are Muslims and millions fighting back. But important for people of all faiths to address the threat.'

The News Corp boss' latest tweets had a far less inflammatory tone than that which he had adopted in the aftermath of the attacks.

On Friday he had suggested that even peaceful Muslims must take responsibility for the actions of terrorists until the 'jihadist cancer' is destroyed.

He wrote: 'Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.' 

He had then attempted to maintain his hardline stance, telling more than 500,000 followers that 'political correctness' made for 'denial and hypocrisy'. 

He added: 'Big jihadist danger looming everywhere from Philippines to Africa to Europe to US.

'Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy.'

Murdoch  words sparked a storm on the social network, with many Muslim users outraged that he had appeared to lay the blame for the terrorist attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket on an entire religion, which has more than one billion followers. 

One user blasted his sweeping generalization and said: '"they" as in most Muslims????? You can't hold an entire religion of billions responsive [sic] for the actions of a few' 

Erwin Renaldi said: 'I'm really sad reading this. Insulting my faith and I have nothing to do with the extremists and I can do nothing.'

Simon Edhouse added: 'Rupert, is West responsible for our extremists, Anders Breivik? etc' 

Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling condemned Murdoch's comments, writing: 'I was born Christian. If that makes Rupert Murdoch my responsibility, I'll auto-excommunicate.' 

She then added: 'The Spanish Inquisition was my fault, as is all Christian fundamentalist violence. Oh, and Jim Bakker.'

Bakker is a disgraced pastor and televangelist who resigned amid a sex scandal, and later served five years of an original 45-year prison sentence for fraud and conspiracy, after stealing millions from charitable donations.  

Others questioned Murdoch's own morals, and referred to the phone-hacking scandal at the now-defunct News of the World newspaper.

Michael Monan replied: '@rupertmurdoch In the same way that you must be held responsible for ordering the hacking of the voicemails of dead school children?'

Murdoch's words also prompted ridicule - with white men, journalists, Australians and men called Rupert apologizing on his behalf.  

The creator of BBC sitcom Citizen Khan, Adil Ray, who said: 'I think all of Australia should be held responsible for Rupert Murdoch.'

Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch thinks all Muslims should apologise for terrorism. So on behalf of white people I'd like to apologise for Rupert Murdoch.'

Richard Robbins said: 'Am I to be held responsible for the rantings of octogenarian media moguls because we're both Caucasian?' 

Another user joked: 'Maybe most Ruperts peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy cancerous media dinosaur @rupertmurdoch, they must be held responsible.'

To which, Rupert Franklin replied: 'I'd like to offer an apology on behalf of us all. Murdoch's comments don't represent the views of mainstream Rupert community.' 

And Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch wrote a tweet. As someone who uses Twitter I would like to apologise on his behalf.'
