Record numbers watched television through iPlayer last year – driven by a surge in viewers using tablets and smartphones, figures show.

The BBC’s online service was used 2.6 billion times to watch shows in 2014, up from 2.1 billion the previous year.

The figures are sure to reignite the debate over whether the TV licence fee remains ‘fit for purpose’.

BBC iPlayer can be accessed through computers, tablets and smartphones and it has become increasingly important to the nation’s viewing habits.

Last year also saw a 51 per cent increase in broadcasts enjoyed on tablets, to 801 million.

There was a sharp rise in the number accessing iPlayer through their mobile phones, up 32 per cent year on year, with 662 million items of television or radio content consumed through them. 

While a viewer still needs to pay the £145.50 for a television licence in order to watch live television through iPlayer, they do not need one if they are only using the catch-up facility.

BBC figures reveal that only 2 per cent of adults consume catch-up content alone. 

However, the use of iPlayer has increased dramatically in recent years. 

In 2011, 1.94 billion pieces of BBC television and radio content were watched through iPlayer, a number that more than doubled to nearly 4.2 billion last year.

Sherlock tops the list of the most popular shows on iPlayer, with all three of the episodes from its latest series making it into the top ten most viewed through the service. 

A staggering 4.2 million people watched the first episode of Sherlock through BBC iPlayer, either live or later on catch-up. 

This compares with 6.84 million who watched it broadcast live on BBC1 on New Year’s Day 2014. 

The top 20 programmes on iPlayer were watched a combined total of more than 56 million times and 17 of them had online audiences at least half the size of those they drew for their live television broadcasts.

BBC3’s Murdered By My Boyfriend, which was watched more than 3 million times online, saw its iPlayer viewing figures far outstrip those it had on television.

Philip Davies, a Conservative member of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said: ‘All of this modern technology, including iPlayer, means that even supporters of the licence fee surely have to question whether it is a sustainable and appropriate model for the future.’

He said the Government and the BBC have to factor in iPlayer viewing figures when discussing renewal of the Corporation’s charter.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘It’s only down to the licence fee that iPlayer or any of these programmes exist and less than 2 per cent of households watch only catch up TV.’
