A 22st woman shed half her body weight after discovering she was too large to sit in an aeroplane seat.

Claire Coles' waistline grew to 52in as a result of an unhealthy diet of takeaways, chocolate and crisps.

And the charity worker was horrified when after booking a dream holiday to Egypt with her husband Neil she was unable to get the seat belt to reach around her size 28 body.

The trip that changed her life: Claire weighed 
22st and 10lbs at her heaviest - but just a year-and-a-half later she is
a trim 11 stone

The plane's crew were eventually able to secure tearful Claire into her seat with a special extended harness.

But the humiliation last January left the 36-year-old determined to slash her daily intake of 10,000 calories and turn her life around.

Claire, a charity officer from Exeter, Devon, said: 'I couldn't fit into the seat, and after the embarrassment of asking for a seat belt extender, it was still a very tight fit.

'I was so ashamed as I was overflowing onto the person sat next to me.

'It was horrendous, I just wanted the floor to open up and swallow me, I spent the five hours of the flight in tears.

'It was at that point I thought enough is enough, I need to drastically change my life.

'I was emotionally eating because I was so unhappy, ironically using food to make me happy.

'I would secret eat and hide food. I had a very unhealthy relationship with food.'

Claire weighed 22st and 10lb at her heaviest - but just a year-and-a-half later she is a healthy 11 stone.

She used to eat takeaways and McDonald's for breakfast, lunch and dinner, along with sweets, chocolate bars and crisps.

Unhealthy diet: She used to eat takeaways and McDonald's for breakfast lunch and dinner, along with sweets, chocolate bars and crisps- totalling as much as 10,000 calories a day but now she can fit in her plane seat (R)

But after swapping calorie-laden snacks for salads, fruit and veg, Claire lost 20in from her waist and is now wearing a dress size 10.

Claire is now helping others lose weight as a slimming consultant at Cambridge Weight Plan in Exeter.

She has even encouraged her husband Neil, 35, to shrink his 40in waist to a more athletic 30in.

And her last flight abroad was a totally different experience.

She said: 'There was so much more room around me, I was so happy - grinning from ear to ear.

'Not only was I able to get the seat belt around me, there was loads of room to spare.

'I
remember like it was yesterday just how embarrassed and sad I felt on 
the last flight. Makes me proud of what I have achieved and excited 
about all the new experiences I will have now I slim and healthy.

'After transforming my own life, it is so rewarding to be able to help others.'
