The Django Unchained actress who claims she was harassed by 'racist' LAPD officers used the N-word and declared that she knew her rights because she played a cop on TV after being handcuffed and detained, MailOnline can reveal.

In between sobs and hysterics, Danièle Watts said: 'I know my rights, I played a cop on TV and I know that when someone asks for ID you aren't required to give it to them.'

The new audio file, recorded by one of the officers on the scene and released exclusively to MailOnline by a law enforcement source, reveals the moment that police slapped handcuffs on Miss Watts after she walked away from an officer who asked to see her identification.

MailOnline can also reveal that of the three officers who showed up to the scene, one is Hispanic, one is a woman and the third - LAPD Sergeant Jim Parker - is openly gay.

'I played a copy on TV!' Daniele Watts, who has accused the LAPD of harassment, played police cadet Angela Mullen in the Showtime comedy 'Weeds'

Miss Watts has repeatedly claimed that she didn't need to show her identification to officers who were called to a CBS lot in Studio City, California, last Thursday. When cops cuffed her, she claimed she knew her rights because of her acting experience.

Miss Watts played police cadet Angela Mullen in eight episodes of the Showtime comedy 'Weeds' in 2012. 

Her other acting credits include Coco in the 2012 film 'Django Unchained' and Laura Jackson in the FX show 'Partners.'

In the audio recording, Miss Watts sobs after being cuffed. An officer can be heard trying to calm her down. 

She tells him through tears: 'You're not the one in handcuffs, you're not the one who's spent your life being called a n*****, and growing up in the South and now I get the cops called on me.

'I'm an actress at this studio! I'm in a major sitcom and I'm still being put in handcuffs because I'm making out with my boyfriend.'

Sgt Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he was offended by claims that Miss Watts was harassed because she is a black woman with a white boyfriend. 

Sgt Parker said he's witnessed first hand many of the department's most dramatic moments - including the 1992 riots over the beating of black motorist Rodney King and the 1997 North Hollywood shoot out. Throughout his career, he says he has watched the LAPD become dramatically more sensitive to race relations and diversity. 

'It’s a new generation. It’s not about who you are or what religion you are or what color you are, it's about who you are and what you do in uniform,' he told MailOnline. 

Sgt Parker, who is white, said that as Miss Watts ranted about being discriminated against for being black, she didn't take the time to realize that all three officers who responded to the scene were minorities. 

'A gay officer, a female officer and a Hispanic officer were there,' he said.

'How funny it is. She kind of didn’t really get the right mix there. It’s quite comical.' 

Sgt. Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he is speaking out because he's seen the department become dramatically more sensitive since he's been on the force

Sgt Parker said that when the complaint about a couple having sex in their car came in, he happened to be right around the corner.  He quickly fingered Miss Watts and her boyfriend of 15 months Brian James Lucas as the suspects - though he said he had no intention of arresting anyone.

Sgt Parker says he simply wanted to respond to the call and then grab a cup of coffee.

Miss Watts and Mrs Lucas maintain they were doing nothing wrong - and that they were only making out, not having sex. 

Sgt Parker said he fears that if he and other officers had not recorded their run-in with Miss Watts, her allegations would have ruined their careers. 

'She picked the wrong person to make a public incident out of a private matter,' he said. 

Miss Watts and Mr Lucas  dispute LAPD assertions that Miss Watts was legally obligated to show ID when asked.

Mr Lucas wrote on his Facebook today: 'What we experienced this past Thursday, September 11 was the THIRD time in the past few months that D and I have had to deal with cops profiling a "black and white couple." This is the THIRD time, an officer has realized his error and had to let us go because we weren't breaking any laws.'

He continues: 'As the LA Times and ACLU have said in the past few days, Daniele had every right NOT to show her ID!!! California does not have a stop and identify statute. According to California State Law, to investigate a potential arrest for lewd behavior (which is a misdemeanor), Sgt Parker would have had to seen us in the middle of the lewd act, OR had talked to a witness at the scene of the alleged crime.'

The LAPD said it is conducting a review of the officers' behavior, but all three remain on the streets.
