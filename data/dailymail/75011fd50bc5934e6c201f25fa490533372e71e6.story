Be prepared for yet more cold, wintry weather with forecasters predicting snow and hail as the unseasonable cold snap is expected to continue well into next week.

Last week saw Britain's coldest March day for almost 30 years as more than two inches of snow fell in some parts of the country.

And the misery is set to continue over the weekend with lower-than-average temperatures as well as frequent showers and chances of hail expected across the country.

The Met office warned of another chilly night with a high risk of ice. Sunday will see persistent showers across the UK with sleet and snow likely in the North East and in some parts of the south.

The
cold weather is likely to continue well into next week. It should 
become slightly warmer by Friday but more unsettled at the same time.

Met Office forecaster Craig Snell 
said: 'It is going to be feeling rather cold this weekend and very 
unsettled. We will see longer spells of rain and possibly sleet and snow
at times. It will be an unsettled, cold weekend for all of us.'

Forecasters warned that the unseasonably cold weather which we have 
been experiencing this week is likely to make a return next week.

Temperatures are likely to plunge again on Tuesday and Wednesday with more snow expected.

Mr Snell said: 'We are expecting 
across most parts of the country - particularly the north - on Tuesday 
and Wednesday that temperatures will again take a tumble and there will
be an increased chance of snow at lower levels.

'At the moment it does look like it will be cold for all of us during the middle part of the week.'

The unseasonably cold weather caused chaos on the Channel Islands this week which saw the worst snow storms in 26 years, leaving drifts up to 8ft deep.

The airport on Guernsey had to be shut for two days while more than 15,000 tons of snow were removed from the runway.

The islands caught the same storms 
that crippled northern France, where shoulder-deep drifts led to Channel
Tunnel trains being cancelled and long queues on the M20 as lorries 
waited for delayed ferries.

Although most of the Guernsey and Jersey snow is now melting, weather men predict another cold snap next week.

Danielle
Stonebridge, 21, a  Guernsey resident, said: ‘I have never seen snow 
like this before, my dad can remember something like this when he was 
around ten years old, but there is just so much of it. It brings the 
child out in me and I have been out in the snow playing, it has been 
great.

'Although it is hard to get around, a five minute journey took me three hours, the roads are absolute carnage.’
