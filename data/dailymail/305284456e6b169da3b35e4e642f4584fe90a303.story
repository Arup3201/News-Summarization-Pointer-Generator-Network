Callous: Tracie Nellis,44, was charged last summer with battery on a person age 65 or older

A Florida nurse has surrendered her  license after she was charged with pouring hot sauce into the mouths of two sleeping dementia patients in a nursing home.

Tracie Nellis, 44, was charged last summer with battery on a person aged 65 or older and misdemeanor battery.

She allegedly poured the hot sauce into the mouths of the dementia sufferers who were residents at the Williston Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Florida in March 2013.

The state Medicaid Fraud Control Unit investigated the shocking incident and Nellis was arrested on January 13, 2014.

She pleaded no contest to the battery charge and was sentenced to one year probation. Last week, the state Board of Nursing ruled she could give up her license to avoid disciplinary proceedings.

Nellis, from Marion County, Florida, is accused of placing the hot sauce in the residents' mouths between March 18 and 19, 2013, according to state records. 

Another employee at the home, Vincent Murano was also arrested with her at the same time according to the State Attorney's Office for Levy County. 

But The Ocala Star reported that in July 2014, the charges against Murano were dropped.

Williston Rehabilitation and Nursing Center has not commented on the incident.
