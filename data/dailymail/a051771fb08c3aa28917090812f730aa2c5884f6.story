Davina McCall has reassured fans that she's well enough to continue with her gruelling Sport Relief triathlon after causing concern following her 1.5-mile swim of Lake Windermere on Monday morning.

The 46-year-old presenter, who admitted last week that she was terrified about the prospect of the swim, was seen having to be dragged out of the water after finishing the stretch.

But as she embarked on the next section of her 500-mile journey from Edinburgh to London - a 65-mile bike ride to Monday's finishing point in Accrington - Davina dismissed concerns about her health with a positive message to her supporters.

'I'm fine': Davina McCall reassured fans that she'll continue with her Sport Relief triathlon as she embarked on a 65-mile cycle ride on Monday

She told the crowds waiting to see her off as she embarked on the next leg of her journey: 'I’m completely fine, I was just cold! I’ve warmed up now, I’ve had a nice bath and I’m ready to get on the bike.'

As well as a bath, Davina was seen indulging in a burger and chips for a much-needed calorie and energy boost.

And the mother-of-three certainly looked in better spirits as she tucked in - a sharp contrast to her worrying appearance after the Windermere swim just hours earlier.

Cheering her on: Supporters flocked around Davina to give her some encouragement ahead of the next leg of her journey

Pedal power: Davina looked determined as she put her game face on

Contrast: Davina's determination and good spirits were in sharp contrast to earlier in the day, when she was seen being dragged out of Lake Windermere following a 1.5 mile swim

After reaching the finish point, Davina was seen clinging to the support kayak for dear life as she was taken over to the dock.

But once on solid ground, Davina struggled to stand, and had to be carried by a member of the crew.

As she was rushed up to the hotel, Davina couldn't even open her eyes, and appeared beyond exhausted.

Pictures
 of Davina later posted on the Sport Relief Twitter page showed the 
presenter wrapped up in blankets as the medical team battled to raise 
her core body temperature.

Tucking in: Davina was seen enjoying a spot of the winter Olympics and chowing down on a burger and chips before starting the bike ride

At last... a smile! Davina appeared cheery as she cycled along the tarmac

Dig in! Davina was able to enjoy the scenery as she pedalled along

Speaking after the swim, Davina said: 
'The moment I got in the water my chest felt crushed - I couldn’t do 
front crawl, I couldn’t put my head under water, I couldn’t breathe. One
 thing Greg told me that was pulling me through was to think of the 
building ahead of us as a magnet, drawing us towards it. When I was near
 the end and really struggling, I got so desperate I looked up to God – 
if there was anyone up there I needed their help!

'I
 kept trying to lift my arm to swim, trying to pull the crawl out of the
 bag, but I couldn’t even get it up. I ended up doing doggy paddle! I 
imagined my sister holding me and pulling me through it. It was such a 
struggle, but I have such a great team around me, I couldn’t have done 
it without them. Although I’m shattered I never felt unsafe, I’m in the 
best possible hands.'

And 
Davina's trainer added: 'I was in the water throughout the whole swim to
 ensure Davina’s safety. It was very tough and very cold, but I can 
reassure people that she was safe throughout and never in any real 
danger. I’m full of admiration for her determination to finish this swim
 and get back on her bike.'

Helping hand: Davina had to be hauled out of the water by the crew after the gruelling swim

Completely drained: Questions are sure to arise 
as to whether Davina will be able to complete the rest of the challenge,
 which concludes on Friday

Struggling to finish: The pain on Davina's face was clear to see as she finished the one-mile swim

Holding on for dear life: Davina was seen clinging onto the boat as she got back to the dock

Fears over Davina's heath certainly weren't unwarranted, however, as it was 
revealed over the weekend that she was undergoing medical tests due 
to concerns that she may be suffering from hypothermia.

Sport Relief chiefs said that she was 'undergoing a medical assessment after suffering suspected signs of hypothermia'.

However, she was later cleared to continue with the challenge.

Health fears: Davina couldn't even open her eyes as she was carried out of the water

Clinging on: Davina had to be carried out of the water by a crew member

Rushing her inside: Davina was accompanied by a large crew of medical professionals as she was taken into the hotel

So
 far in the BT Sport Relief Challenge: Davina - Beyond Breaking Point, 
she has pedalled her way through temperatures which have been just 3C 
(37.4F), plus a further chill from winds of up to 40mph.

In
 previous years David Walliams picked up bugs during swimming down the 
River Thames, as well as developing sores from his wetsuit, and two 
years ago John Bishop was left in agony amid worries about stress 
fractures as he did back-to-back marathon distances while travelling 
from Paris to London.

Prior 
to embarking on the swim, Davina's fear was clear to see, with a video 
of the mother-of-three showing her breaking down in tears as she 
prepared for the task ahead.

Wrapped up: The team's main concern was raising Davina's core body temperature after she was brought in from the cold

Trying to warm up: Davina looked entirely exhausted as she sat in bed covered in blankets

That's better: As Davina was given a hot chocolate, she finally managed a small smile

Wearing a black wetsuit, Davina 
attempted to hold back the sobs as she coaxed herself into the water, 
telling her trainer, Professor Whyte: 'I'm gonna be ok'.

Davina
 was then seen sitting on the dock before tentatively lowering herself 
into the water to begin the swim, to the sounds of applause from fans 
there to cheer her on.

Sport
 Relief have also been keeping fans updated with Davina's progress on 
their Twitter page, admitting it has been 'hard to watch' someone who is
 clearly so terrified attempt to complete the latest section of the 
challenge.

Terrified: Davina McCall was seen looking petrified as she embarked on her one-mile swim of Lake Windermere on Monday as part of her Sport Relief challenge 

Struggling: Davina explained earlier this week that the Windermere swim was the part of the 500-mile journey she was most scared of

Reassurance: Davina was seen telling herself 'I'm gonna be ok' before she lowered herself into the freezing cold lake

They tweeted: 'She's struggling. Finding it incredibly hard to breathe because of the intense cold #davina #windermere.'

Before adding: 'Unfortunately this swim is proving to be every bit as difficult as #davina feared.'

And then: 'She's stopped. She's talking to herself, desperate not to give up. #davina #windermere.'

But Davina managed to get past her fears and complete the challenge successfully, after a gruelling and physically draining swim.

Last minute pep talk: Davina finally managed a smile before she and her trainer lowered themselves into the water

And she's off: Davina was struggling during the journey, but appeared to be determined not to give in

Explaining her intense fear over the prospect of swimming Lake Windermere, Davina wrote in The Telegraph 
newspaper earlier this week: 'I don't like swimming in
 lakes and I especially don't like swimming in lakes that are only a 
degree or two above freezing.

'This entire challenge makes my stomach do 
funny things but the Windermere swim petrifies me.

'My
 open water training under the tutelage of Prof Greg Whyte who helped 
David Walliams and John Bishop hit extraordinary heights has been 
incredibly tough and the cold is indescribable – God only knows what 
Windermere will be like.'
