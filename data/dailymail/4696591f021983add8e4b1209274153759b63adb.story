Protestors have stomped on the steps outside Immigration minister Scott Morrison's office today in a 'symbolic' objection to the Australian government's policy on refugees.

More than 400 people marched from Munroe Park, in Sydney's south to Morrison's electorate office at Cronulla in a united stand against the 'abhorrent' conditions some have claimed refugees are being placed under by the country's top politicians.

A few of the major talking points in Saturday's protest, which coincided with World Refugee Day, was the controversial Nauru and Manus Island detention centres and a $10,000 government handout being offered to refugees to help them return to their country and assimilate back into society.

Saturday's protests in Sydney were a peaceful objection to the government's hard-lined approach on refugee

Families, individuals, not-for-profit and political groups turned out today to have their say against the Abbott Government's asylum seeker policies

Protest organiser Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition group called the Abbott Government's cash incentive, reported in Fairfax Media, a 'shoddy bribe' and what the government should be concentrating on is processing refugees in Australia and protecting them with temporary refugee statuses.

The issue is particularly sensitive given the hostile climate currently being experienced in Iraq, Mr Rintoul said. 'They are just trying these shotty bribes on to get around their obligations of processing people in Australia,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It is just disgusting.' There should be no stopping the boats, the Government should be making sure these people get to Australia safely.'

Labor Immigration spokesman Richard Marles agreed. He said the Government should focus on processing asylum seekers, instead of offering them money to leave before their claims are assessed.

'We don't need blank cheques, we need people being processed.'

But Mr Morrison said the financial incentives are a positive for refugees, and it's not just money the Government is offering but 'training, support and other issues to assist people to get on their feet when they return,' he said.

It has been reported the return packages for Iranians amount to $7,000, while Afghans are being offered $4,000. It is not known whether Iraqi's are being offered any money or are eligible under the scheme.

Manus Island, Narau and Australian detention centres were a major talking point at Saturday's rally

Mr Rintoul called the resettlement package a 'desperate' bid by the Government to avoid more in-detention crises such as the death of Reza Barati on February 17.

An independent review handed down into riots at the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea on February 16-18, found protests turned fatal after months of repeated violence, clashes and tension between Iranian asylum seekers and PNG nationals working there.

The attorney-general’s Department Robert Cornall found Mr Berati, 23, died of a cardiac arrest, and suffered brutal head injuries when attacked in the compound of the Manus Island centre.

Jordan Humphreys, also representing the Refugee Action Coalition, said he was not anti-Abott, but did not agree with his hard-lined approach to refugees coming to Australia and being shipped off shore.

'We marched outside Morrison's office as a symbolic protest against his policies.' he said. He called the march symbolic because being a Saturday,  Morrison's office was empty but he still hoped the message got across.

On a Facebook page dedicated to today's march, organisers wrote 'Manus, Nauru or in the domestic detention network, Aus­tralia inflicts serious suffering on refugees whose only ‘crime’ is to ask Australia for help.'
