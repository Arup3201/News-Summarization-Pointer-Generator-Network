President Barack Obama can't play Angry Birds on his smartphone. No Words With Friends, no Candy Crush, and no Texas Hold'em. And he can blame the NSA.

A retired National Security Agency technical director said Thursday that the government spy shop tasked him with custom-fitting a Blackberry for the president. That meant stripping away every built-in feature that a hacker might exploit.

'You try to get rid of any functionality that's not really required,' Richard George told CNN Money. 'Every piece of functionality is an opportunity for the adversary.'

So that means the leader of the free world isn't free to while away his hours crushing pigs with catapulting birds, or trying to come up with a 70-point play on a triple-word-score box.

Only calls 10 numbers: Obama's Blackberry is stripped down to the bare-bones essentials, and can't ring up any phone that doesn't share his high-level encryption

No fun of any kind: The president's smartphone has no games that a hacker could use as a back-door into his secure communications

Tech-savvy: Obama happily uses an iPad, a MacBook Air and whatever other secure devices his team puts at his fingertips

When Obama came into office, George said, he wanted a way to keep in touch with his closest advisers. And the request presented several frightening problems.

'It just really bothered a lot of people: Nobody wanted to put anything out there that wasn't completely secure,' George explained.

The president had a Blackberry during his Senate career and his presidential campaign.

Ultimately the NSA's tech experts chose a model that they could customize most easily to leave him with the barest of bare-bones features.

What was left when the digital dust settled is a state secret, and the NSA won't even say whether Obama can take pictures or send emails or text messages.

But the phone is limited to calling only about 10 numbers, since they belong to aides – and, presumably, family members – whose phones use the same type of encryption.

The Wall Street Journal reported this year that the White House Communications Agency was considering a switch to Android, and was testing LG and Samsung phones.

Blackberry insisted at the time, however, that 'the U.S. government continues to choose BlackBerry for its unmatched security and cost effectiveness.'

'Other vendors such as Samsung and LG still have a long way to go to catch up to meet the government’s stringent requirements and certifications,' the company said in a March statement.

Richard "Dickie" George, formerly the technical director of NSA's Information Assurance Directorate, told CNN Money that he was in charge of retrofitting Obama's phone so it wouldn't present a national security risk

The NSA's George said President George W. Bush (L) may have had access to a mobile phone, but it would have been a giant 'brick' like the mock-worthy device sported by Zack Morris on 'Saved by the Bell' (R)

Parting is such sweet sorrow: Obama, pictured the day he was sworn in as president in 2009, had to get ri of the smartphone that got him through the presidential campaign

The president reportedly uses an iPad for reading and an encrypted MacBook Air for his daily work.

George told CNN that he wasn't sure if presidents before Obama used smartphones, but he hinted that any presidential mobile phones before 2008 were 'like a brick.'

If George W. Bush had one, he said, 'I'm betting he didn't know it was five pounds because I'm betting he didn't carry it.'

CNN quipped that in the Clinton and Bush years, an aide would have carried it because it 'looked like the one Zack Morris used on the 1990s sitcom, "Saved by The Bell".'
