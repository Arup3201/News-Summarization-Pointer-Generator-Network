Extravagant: Tony Billings led a double life and fleeced people of cash to shower his lover with gifts

A married fantasist stole £430,000 to pay for extravagant gifts and foreign holidays for a woman he was obsessed with.

Tony Billings lived an extravagant and a bizarre double life, purporting to be a wealthy businessman to impress the 'love of his life' during their affair, Leicester Crown Court was told.

Billings posed as a chartered accountant with a PhD from the London School of Economics and convinced colleagues and friends he was phenomenally successful.

The ex-bookkeeper, described as 'singularly average' by his lawyer, smooth-talked his way into a directorship of sports company, Tennis Midlands Ltd, based at Loughborough University.

He stole £360,000 from the business, causing it to collapse.

He also duped fellow director and Leicestershire tennis professional, David Ireland, out of £70,000 savings, saying he was investing the cash for him.

Self-styled 'Dr Billings' always drove new cars and showered his lover - a Derbyshire hairdresser, with treats, including jewellery, cases of champagne and toys for her children.

He even gave her £100,000 to pay her divorce settlement and took her to New York and Sri Lanka  - giving her £700-a-month to be his 'research assistant'.

However the 52-year-old's excessive lifestyle crashed back to reality when he was sentenced to four years in prison on Thursday.

His wife, Anne Billings, who signed over the last £28,000 equity on their home before he was made bankrupt, was seated in the public gallery, still supporting him despite his infidelity.

Judge 
Michael Pert QC said: 'I'm told the reason you stole was to lavish money
on a woman other than your long-suffering wife and this is somehow an 
excuse in your mind for what you did.

'You're
a thief. You lived a lie, sitting in an office with plaques and awards 
and Financial Times articles on the wall and certificates of academic 
excellence - all lies'.

Billings, a father of one, from Oakwood, Derby, admitted theft and fraud.

John Hallissey, prosecuting, said: 'Over the course of several years Billings lived a double life.

'He
invented a world for himself in which he was a successful, wealthy 
economist, a professor, who was able to make substantial sums of money 
in the stock market.

'With 
extravagant claims and spending he convinced his friends, work 
colleagues and even a woman he was in a relationship with of his 
financial prowess and success. His whole world was a sham and his entire
lifestyle was financed by theft or fraud.

'In 2007 he trained as a tennis coach at the Nottingham Tennis Centre. It was there he met David Ireland'.

Even when arrested, Billings was bizarrely secretly instructing solicitors in the purchase of an £870,000 house.

He falsely claimed to have once owned an accountancy business and offered to help with the club's books.

He
assisted associates from the club to apply for Lawn Tennis Association 
funding to establish a tennis coaching performance programme at the LTA 
Academy at Loughborough University.

When
the bid was successful he was offered a directorship of the business, 
Tennis Midlands Ltd, with responsibility for the finances, because of 
his so called expertise.

Mr 
Hallissey said Billings adorned his office wall with photos of articles 
from the Financial Times, with his name superimposed on them.

Early in 2010 the cracks began to appear and staff were not paid for three months.

He made excuses, blaming cash flow and the death of his father - who was still alive.

On
June 21, 2010,  he failed to turn up for work and sent a text message 
saying he 'cannot go on any more' to one of the staff saying Tennis 
Midlands had ceased trading the previous week.

Mr Hallissey said: 'For several years he treated Tennis Midlands' account as though it was his own personal current account.

'Between 2008 and 2010 he stole and spent around £400,000.

'He
was wooing a woman he'd known for some time through tennis clubs. He 
would carry ostentatiously large bundles of cash.In June 2010 he was 
made bankrupt'.

Defence counsel, Philip Bown, said: 
'His deluded behaviour was to maintain an interest of this lady who 
clearly was the love of his life.

'He was motivated by desperation to impress her. His lies and dishonesty left misery and destruction in its wake'.

When his lover found out about his bankruptcy, he told her: 'If I lose you, I've lost everything'.

Mr Brown described him as being mentally fragile, suffering from depression and having low self-esteem.

Billings
met his lover in 2004. To maintain her interest he told her he was 
suffering from testicular cancer, when it wasn't true.

'He's
a singularly average man, married for many years and was formerly a 
bookkeeper. He was besotted by her and lost touch with reality'.

Speaking after the sentencing Mr 
Ireland, 40, said: 'It's shocking and disgusting that someone you work 
with and trust could do such a thing.

'It's one of the harsh lessons in life.

'You
hope not to meet those sorts of people. He was plausible, spent a lot 
of time at work, was always the first in the office, and appeared to 
have the best interests of the company at heart, which wasn't the case.

'Fortunately the company has reformed under a new name and the staff are still working'.
