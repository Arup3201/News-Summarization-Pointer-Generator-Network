If you just can't be without your phone or tablet, even when you're in bed, a pair of Canadian inventors have created a pillow that doubles up as a charger.

The Power Pillow comes with two portable batteries, and each battery is fitted with two USB ports capable of charging a phone and tablet at the same time.

Its makers claim each battery will charge an iPhone six times before it runs out of power, but will need to be charged for 10 hours to reach full capacity again.

The Power Pillow, pictured left in a bedroom and right on a sofa, comes with two portable batteries. One is placed inside the pillow, while the other can be charged separately via a wall plug. Each battery has two ports, meaning two devices can be charged at the same time

Electric lights, including those which illuminate laptop computers, smartphones and tablets, often play a key role in causing people to sleep badly, according to a leading health expert.

Artificial lights disrupt the body's natural rhythm, affect chemicals in the brain and drive people to use stimulants like caffeine to stay awake longer.

The claims were made by professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, Charles Czeisler.

However, a follow-up study by psychiatrists in Arizona found that simply lowering the brightness of a screen and holding the gadget about 12 inches away from the face can stop the light from interfering with a good night’s sleep.

The Power Pillow is aimed at people who 'watch films or TV, check emails, or read on their tablets and Kindles in bed.'

It is the brainchild of Canadian inventor Geoff Martin who came up with the idea when he was speaking to his brother on the phone in bed and his battery ran out.

He started working on the project with his partner Lisa Sutt and they created various designs and prototypes.

The pair has now launched a campaign on Kickstarter and is hoping to raise $30,000 (£18,200) to fund the device.

The pillow is being sold for $79 (£48) for a pillow and one battery.

People who donate $124 (£76) will be sent a cushion, two batteries, and two micro USB cables.

Lisa, 37, from Nova Scotia in Canada, said: ‘Geoff and I were relaxing in bed when his brother Frank called: 'While he was on the phone with his brother he blurted out "why not have a pillow that you can directly connect your phone to for charging."'

‘I was sitting next to him on the bed working on my laptop and thought it was a good idea, and we immediately started working on the Power Pillow.

‘We have gone through dozens of design drawings, dozens of batteries and over a dozen prototypes.’

The charging system comes with two 12000mAh battery packs, one is kept in the pillow along with a charging USB cable.

The other pack is charged separately via a wall plug.

When one battery dies, it can be replaced with the fully-charged pack so the pillow is never without charge.

Alternatively, the second battery can be carried in a bag or pocket and used to charge a device when out of the house.

Each lithium polymer battery in the pillow is lined with ExStatic fabric made with carbon nanotubes to offer protection against the voltage. They are also cased in a battery pack.

‘In a nut shell, Power Pillow will make running to an outlet a thing of the past,‘ continued Sutt.

‘Even with one per cent battery left on your phone, by simply plugging into the Power Pillow right beside you, you will extend your call for literally hours. The same goes for watching movies and playing games.’
