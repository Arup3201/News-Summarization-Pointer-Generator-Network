When Adrian and Emma Bradbury found out they were expecting their first child, they couldn’t wait to tell everyone.

But they wanted to do something different from the usual phone call or email.

And so they invited family and friends to see their baby scan projected on to the white cliffs at Eastbourne in East Sussex.

Telling the world: Adrian and Emma Bradbury invited family and friends to their 'portrait gallery' as they projected the 20-week scan of their child on to the Eastbourne cliffs

Previously, the couple had projected their 12-week scan on to the side of the Towner Art Galley in Eastbourne and sent photographs of the event to their loved ones.

This was such a success that they projected their 20-week scan on to the cliffs, the walls of medieval Pevensey Castle and the Martello Tower in Clacton-on-Sea.

Mr Bradbury, 30, a ceramic tiler, said: ‘We were really excited when we found out we were going to be parents and we wanted to do something different to tell people that Emma was pregnant – something we could always tell our child.

‘With the help of a friend, we went down to the art gallery one night and used a projector to put the image on to the wall.

‘We kept it up for an hour and it attracted a lot of attention from passers-by.

'Even the cleaner inside the art gallery came outside to see what the fuss was about.

‘Afterwards, we loaded the photograph on to Facebook and all our friends loved it. It made it even more special for us.’

Proud parents: The 12-week scan of Adrian and Emma Bradbury's baby projected on to an art gallery wall in Eastbourne

The Towner Art Gallery – which was unaware of Mr Bradbury’s plans – is considering an exhibition of the couple’s photographs and projections and has already offered the unborn child membership.

The Bradburys used a generator to project the scan on to their chosen surfaces, choosing areas open to the public.

Mr Bradbury said he was inspired to make the extravagant announcement after his wife, a 27-year-old beautician, started a baby diary.

He added: ‘It’s a great way of capturing how we felt about the scan at that time instead of hospital scan photo paper which we may lose in 15 years.

‘Once we have saved enough money, we are going to have a 4D scan and do something artistic with it on a larger scale, but we are keeping that under wraps for now.’

There has been a boom in US-style pregnancy announcements such as ‘gender reveal parties’, where expectant parents announce their child’s sex by cutting into a white cake to reveal pink or blue sponge.
