For any student, the pressure of university finals is bad enough - but for Louise Sinnott, 22, the stress was exacerbated by having to rush to the loo up to 20 times a day as she suffered a flare-up of her Crohn's disease.

'I couldn't do anything or plan anything because I needed to be close to a loo all the time. Which, as well as being hugely inconvenient and unpleasant, is also horribly embarrassing,' she recalls.'I left my student flat and went home to my mum's house to lock myself away until the attack had died down.'

Crohn's is an autoimmune condition affecting the bowel that is caused when the immune system triggers the release of a protein, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, which kills the 'good bacteria' in the gut.

This leads
 to inflammation and, in turn, diarrhoea, stomach pain, weight loss - 
because of poor digestion of food - and extreme tiredness.

Around 115,000 people in the UK have Crohn's, with most diagnosed between their mid-teens and late 20s.

But
 new figures suggest that its incidence is rising dramatically - there 
has been a 300 per cent increase in the number of 16 to 29-year-olds 
receiving treatment in England for Crohn's in the past ten years, 
according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre.

Crohn's 
is a chronic, often debilitating condition and many patients end up 
needing surgery to remove part of their bowel.

Last week, the Mail 
reported on Crohn's sufferer Bethany Townsend, who became an internet 
sensation by posting a photograph of herself in a bikini, exposing the 
colostomy bags she has to wear because of the condition.

Bethany, 23,
 a make-up artist who was diagnosed when she was three, said she posted 
the picture to help others in her position feel more comfortable in 
their own skin.

So why are more and more young people like Bethany and Louise succumbing to Crohn's disease?

The
 condition has a strong genetic link - 'a person with a first-degree 
relative, such as a parent, with Crohn's has a one in ten chance of 
developing it,' says Alastair Forbes, professor of medicine at Norwich 
Medical School.

It may be that a genetic predisposition is 
exacerbated by poor diet, suggests Dr Sally Mitton, a consultant 
gastroenterologist at St George's Hospital in South-West London.

'If you
 have a lot of junk food it makes it more likely that you will develop 
Crohn's.'

Certain foods could make the gut 'go into overdrive', 
causing inflammation as it tries to process them, says Janindra 
Warusavitarne, a consultant colorectal surgeon at St Mark's Hospital, 
Harrow. 'It could be that certain foods cause a change in the types of 
bugs living in the gut - we're only speculating, but this may well be 
processed foods.'

Ironically, many Crohn's sufferers prefer sweet, 
processed foods because these are less likely to cause diarrhoea than 
high-fibre foods such as bran cereals.

But diet alone can't be to 
blame, as many patients who develop Crohn's eat healthily. Another 
potential trigger is smoking, which can double the risk by reducing 
blood supply to the gut.

One theory is that it is linked to the 
over-prescription of antibiotics, particularly in childhood and the 
teenage years, which may kill off 'good' gut bacteria.

Crohn's disease is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system.

Inflammation is the body's reaction to injury or irritation and can cause redness, swelling and pain.

Crohn's
 disease is one of the two main forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
(IBD).The other common form of IBD is Ulcerative Colitis.

Crohn's
 is described as chronic, meaning it is a life-long condition. Sufferers
 will have periods of good health, remission, as well as times when 
their symptoms flare up or relapse.

There is currently no cure for the disease, but drugs and surgery can give patients long periods of relief from their symptoms.

The
 cause of Crohn's disease is not well understood. Experts believe the 
condition is, in part, inherited, while an abnormal reaction of the 
immune system to certain bacteria in the intestines is thought to 
contribute.

Viruses, bacteria, diet, smoking and stress have 
all been suggested as environmental triggers, but there is no definitive
 evidence that any one of these is a cause of Crohn's.

Crohn's
 causes ulcers to form in the gut and inflammation that affects the 
body's ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste in a
 healthy way.

Symptoms include:

Abdominal pain and diarrhoea

Tiredness and fatigue

Feeling generally unwell

Mouth ulcers

Loss of appetite and weight loss

Anaemia - a reduced level of red blood cells

It's estimated around 250,000 people suffer from the condition in the 
UK. It can start in any age, but usually appears for the first time 
between the ages of 10 and 40.

The disease can cause complications
 including perforations. They happen when a severe blockage ruptures the
 bowel, making a hole. The contents of the bowel can leak through and 
form an abscess. It causes pain and a fever.Source: Crohn's and Colitis UK

Whatever the 
cause, there is no cure.

Treatments such as steroids can reduce 
inflammation and immunosuppressant drugs help to control flare-ups.

Avoiding stress and taking exercise can help, too, but about 60 per cent
 of patients eventually need surgery.

The condition can improve with
 age - so if symptoms are controlled and you get an early diagnosis you 
may avoid the need for surgery, says Professor Forbes.

'Unfortunately
 that doesn't always happen, as often the disease is confused with 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),' says Mr Warusavitarne. 'In the early 
stages Crohn's symptoms can be quite subtle.'

In cases such as 
Bethany Townsend's, when a lot of damaged intestine has been removed, a 
colostomy bag may well be the only option.

The surgery is designed 
to temporarily divert waste away from the inflamed colon into a bag to 
allow the colon to heal - the end of the small intestine is disconnected
 from the colon and rerouted through a hole, known as a stoma, in the 
abdomen. An external bag is attached to the opening to collect the 
waste.

Once inflammation in the colon has settled down, a second 
operation is performed to close the stoma and reattach the small 
intestine to the colon.

In Bethany Townsend's case, the bags have not worked and doctors are considering other options, even a bowel transplant.

'But
 I'm still really hopeful and after everything I've been through I know 
I'm a strong person,' Bethany says. 'I'm looking forward to chasing my 
goals.'

The mystery for Louise Sinnott is why she developed Crohn's 
in the first place, as she ate healthily and there is no family history 
of the condition.

She wonders if a stomach bug she caught on holiday in 
Madeira in 2011, when she was 19, may have triggered it.

Mr 
Warusavitarne says the disease can be triggered in this way. 'When gut 
bacteria are exposed to a stomach bug or perhaps a new type of food, 
they can be radically altered in people with a genetic predisposition to
 Crohn's, with an increase in harmful bacteria and fewer beneficial 
bacteria.'

Louise's GP initially diagnosed IBS. Like Crohn's this 
causes stomach cramps, bloating and diarrhoea, though only Crohn's 
causes weight loss and persistent diarrhoea. Crohn's sufferers may also 
have a 'lump' in their abdomen.

But over the next few months Louise's
 symptoms worsened and she was sent back to hospital in February 2013 
for a colonoscopy, where the lining of the bowel is examined using a 
tiny camera. This confirmed she had Crohn's.

'It was such a relief to know what it was,' says Louise, who is about  to start work as an environmental business adviser.

After
 three months on steroids she was put on a daily anti-inflammatory drug,
 Pentasa. She is likely to have to take this for life.

Louise is now
 careful about what she eats, limits her alcohol intake  and has begun 
exercising. 'I've got no choice but to live with Crohn's,' she says. 
'But I'm determined that I should control it, not let it control me.'
