A crime scene has been established and police have cordoned off the laneway.

Police say they have not yet identified the man. 

It's believed homeless people have been using the laneway to sleep because of a small undercover area.

'I walk this way every day, and there's been a lot of homeless people sleeping in there,' one woman told Fairfax media.
