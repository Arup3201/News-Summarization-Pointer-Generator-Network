If Ryan Tannehill is the future for the Miami Dolphins, he may look back on his short spell in England somewhat fondly.

On the back of consecutive defeats, the third-year quarterback responded to the most difficult spell of his career with a superb perfomance at Wembley to steer Miami to a 38-14 win over Oakland.

Tannehill threw for 278 yards, completed 14 consecutive passes and averaged 11 yards per throw in a halycon period in the second half.

And all after head coach Joe Philbin declined to name him as starter.

'I think Coach Philbin was clear with me on where I stood, and I felt confident coming in,' said Tannehill after his strong display of mental resolve.

'If people were writing or talking about me in a certain way, personally, I still wanted to come out and play well. I'm a realist.

'I envision myself as a good player, and I know I wasn't playing up to those standards the first three weeks.

'I wanted to come out and personally play better, and my teammates need that from me. They expect me to play better, and to be able to come out and to finally do that, it felt good.'

The 25-year-old also admitted to being about the Dolphins' trip across the pond.

'I think I've been more excited for this week, this game. As the week went on and everything, all the distractions, to finally leave the country, have a long flight, and come over here and get ready for the game. I think I was more excited for this game than I've been for a game in a long time,' said Tannehill after moving the Dolphins to 2-2.

Meanwhile, Philbin was full of praise for his signal caller, saying: 'I thought he played very well. I thought he had good rhythm. He had good tempo. He had good command. He was very decisive out there.

I thought he threw the ball very accurately. I thought he made some plays with his feet, as well. I thought he made good decisions in the run game whether to give, whether to keep, whether to throw the bubble screens, etc. It looked like he played a very good football game.

Central to the Dolphins improvement was a functioning offensive line.

'They did a great job, like I said, keeping me clean in the pocket and giving me time to throw the ball downfield, as well as the run game,' said Tannehill.

'I think we gave them some different looks, some challenging looks for them to line up to, spread them out laterally and then created space for Lamar and the backs to get vertical in the middle.'

While Tannehill enjoyed his European adventure, it was a different story for the Raiders' rookie quarterback Derek Carr.

The 23-year-old was 16 for 25 with 146 yards, when he was hurt in the third quarter. Third-stringer Matt McGloin replaced him with Matt Schaub remaining in Oakland for a personal matter.

'I know the X-rays on his ankle were negative, but that's the extent of what I know,' said coach Dennis Allen.
