A University of Newcastle student has been caught broadcasting live sex shows from a campus library.

The university said she had been 'counselled' after officials were informed she was broadcasting the solo sex performances from the Auchmuty campus library, on the New South Wales coast north of Sydney.

Her sex shows were screened on a pay per view website and promoted via social media, the Newcastle Herald reported.

A University of Newcastle spokeswoman said the institution was 'very disappointed' when the student was found to be 'using internet facilities inappropriately on campus'.

'We have a code of conduct that clearly outlines the sorts of behaviours the university expects from its community on campus,' she said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia.

'The matter has now been investigated and the student has been counselled.

'An important part of our duty of care is to protect our students' privacy and it would be inappropriate for the university to provide specific details in relation to the incident.'

The section of the library where she performed sex acts on camera has since been steam cleaned.

The University of Newcastle has the third highest number of students registered to 'sugar daddy' matchmaking site Seeking Arrangement in Australia.

The Newcastle University Students’ Association president Clare Swan said the incident highlighted the fact that students need more financial support.

‘Newcastle has a high enrolment of students from low socio-economic background – it’s 26 per cent,’ Ms Swan said.

‘The question shouldn’t be any sort of judgement or about the morals involved.

‘Our primary concern should be the health and safety of the student.’
