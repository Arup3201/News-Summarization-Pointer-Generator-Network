An obese mother-of-three lost half her body weight and dropped eight dress sizes after swapping unhealthy eating habits for a healthy meal plan.

Maria Doherty, 46, who once tipped the scales at 22st, struggled to climb stairs, and was on the cusp of diabetes, shed 10 stone and turned her life around after getting a wake-up call about the consequences of her unhealthy diet.

Today, weighing in at 11st and having taken up long-distance running, she says her experience should encourage anyone who fears they are too overweight to begin living healthily.

Maria has now dropped an amazing 10 stone from a size 28 and 22st (left) to 11st and a fit size 12 (right)

She said: 'I never imagined I would get this far. Now I love my life. I feel as if there’s nothing I can’t do.'

Maria saw her weight steadily increase due to her habit of choosing unhealthy, high calorie options for evening meals.

She said: 'My weakness was junk food. I would always sort out dinner for the children and wait until later to arrange my own meal, by which time it was easier to order a takeaway.

'I would only have one square meal a day. I tricked myself into overeating at that meal because I wasn’t sure how long it would be until I ate again.'

Maria was ordered to wear a blood pressure monitor by doctors concerned about her deteriorating health

Maria's size increased in tandem with her age and while at age 16, Maria was wearing size 16 clothes by the time she reached 18, she could only fit into size 18.

By the time she was 40, she wore size 28 clothes and weighed 22 stone and found her weight was beginning to seriously impact her well-being.

In late 2009 she was ordered to wear a blood pressure monitor by doctors concerned about her deteriorating health.

She said: 'I was in the first stages of diabetes, and there was talk of putting me on blood pressure tablets permanently. It was a wake-up call.

Maria's weight slowly increased through out her teens and by the time she was 40 she was a 28 and suffering as a result of her size

'I was challenged by everything I did. Walking upstairs left me red-faced and struggling for breath.'

By 2010 Mrs Doherty’s sons had left the family home and she had the opportunity to undertake an intensive exercise regime.

She said: 'I was daunted. I thought I was too far gone to lose weight - that my health was too damaged. My goal was to get down to a size 20 and shed three or four stone.

'I cleared out the cupboard of all my unhealthy snacks and started eating three times a day.'

Maria, pictured at her wedding in November 2003, says her husband and two sons were very supportive during her weight loss

Before beginning her weight loss journey, Maria an office manager, rarely ate breakfast, and binged on fatty foods at either lunch or dinner time.

Her new healthy lifestyle involves a typical breakfast of a grain bar or cereal, followed by salad for lunch and pre-prepared calorie-controlled meals such as baked salmon for dinner, with apples for snacks during the day.

She said: 'There were times when I had real cravings, but as people complimented me for losing the weight, it spurred me on.'

She was encouraged in her efforts by her husband of ten years Dave, 47, who works as a design engineer, and her sons Ian, 26, Christopher, 23 and Stephen, 20.

She said: 'Dave was fantastic. He adores me as I am but knew I was losing weight for the right reasons.'

After the first week of her new diet Mrs Doherty had lost 9lbs. Ten months later, she had lost an impressive 5st.

She
 said: 'I realised that if I didn’t exercise, the excess skin would just
 hang, so I started visiting the gym four times and week and found a 
personal trainer.'

Keiron 
O’Donnell, her personal trainer at the Shaw Hill Leisure Club in 
Chorley, surprised her in August 2011, when she was 14st, by announcing 
that he had entered her for the London Marathon.

She
 said: 'I was petrified. I thought: ‘I’m 45 years old, I’ve abused my 
body for so many years, how on earth can someone who was on the brink of
 diabetes even consider running a marathon?’

'I was terrified I would have a heart attack - I wasn’t aware that your heart regenerates if you look after it.'

Maria is now healthy and happy, and running has become a huge part of her life. She hopes her transformation will inspire others who feel they are too unhealthy or overweight to make changes

She ran the race in 2012 raising £3,000 for the Carer’s Trust, completing the course in just under 5h10m.

Today Maria, of Chorley, Lancashire weighs 11st and is a healthy size 12 but is still careful to visit the gym regularly and maintain a healthy diet.

She said: 'It felt amazing to have achieved so much and have raised so much for charity. I would like my next big race to be the Venice marathon.

'In my wildest dreams I never imagined I would be smaller than I was when I was at school.

'The world is my oyster, but I need to be vigilant. I need to be careful about my eating habits and avoiding yo-yoing in weight.

'To anyone worried that their lives are too unhealthy for them to do anything about it, if they’re worried they’ll never be able to change, I would say ‘anything’s possible’. A slimming club and friends can be useful for giving you support.

'I never would have believed I could this far, but I’m proof that if you stick at something, you can achieve your goals.'
