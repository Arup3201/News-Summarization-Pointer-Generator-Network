An unnamed grandfather is winning a lot of online plaudits after his impassioned letter of support for his gay grandson was posted online on Monday.

The letter tells the heartfelt story of how different generations react to the news that a family member is gay, but in this instance it is the older generation telling their offspring that they need to show more compassion.

In the letter, the grandfather passionately addresses his daughter Christine's decision to kick her son, Chad, out of their home after he has told her that he’s gay.

Christine's father doesn’t hold back in letting his daughter know how extremely disappointed he is with her reaction to her own flesh and blood.

'You’re correct that we have a "shame in the family," but mistaken about what it is,' he blasts her.

He goes on to call her actions 'the real "abomination" here' and that a parent disowning her child is what really goes 'against nature.'

As well as blasting his daughter for her extreme treatment of her own son, he then tries to reason with her by saying that Chad 'didn’t choose it [being gay] any more than he being left-handed.'

The grandfather goes on to describe his daughter’s actions as ‘hurtful, narrow-minded and backward,’ before threatening to disowned her for being a 'heart-less B-word of a daughter.'

However the letter does end on a conciliatory note as he asks Christine to give him a call.

The correspondence first appeared on the Facebook page of FCKH8.com.

‘We were blown away by how this guy stands by his grandson and stands up against his own homophobic daughter. This is real love.' wrote FCKH8.com.

It has attracted more than 8,000 likes and 3,000 comments since it was posted on Monday and the comments are overwhelming in support of the grandfather’s response.

‘Bestest gramps ever!!!!!!! He wins the internet!!,’ wrote Megan Woodcock Keegan.

Lauren Moose Boland commented: ‘Go Grandpa!!!! I swear our parents, parents were more open minded than our parents.’

‘Sad for the daughter that she chose this. I'm just so happy that the son has family to still surround him and support him,’ wrote Tinka Lawrence.
