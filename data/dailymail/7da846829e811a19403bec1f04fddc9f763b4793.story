It ended as it started, in celebratory mood. At times, it might have seemed like a lacklustre party full of curmudgeons and killjoys refusing to enter into the spirit. But eventually the guests did get into the swing of things to produce an evening of lukewarm revelry, even if they had to be prodded into action.

Wayne Rooney had led England out on the occasion on his 100th cap with his sons Kai alongside him and Klay in his arms. And Sir Bobby Charlton presented him a special cap embroidered with gold thread in honour of his landmark.

And yet once the formalities were over, it was as though no-one quite knew just what kind of an occasion this was. It required a degree of swagger and joy and yet it threatened to be a dour and forgettable affair.

Ratings from ROB DRAPER at Wembley 

The gatecrashers didn’t help: Slovenia were well organised, effective and at times brutal. And they completely disrupted the running order when they took the lead though that at least sparked England into some action, with Rooney himself was forced to take the initiative, winning and converting a penalty before Danny Welbeck’s two goals put the game out of Slovenia’s reach and ensure that England’s steady march to Euro 2016 continues unimpeded and that Rooney would at least end the game happily.

‘It was a wonderful evening for him,’ said his manager Roy Hodgson afterwards. ‘It must have been special to have the cap presented by Sir Bobby Charlton. And then to give a good performance and cap that by scoring the important first goal. It put us right back in the game after their goal against the run of play - but we were good value for our victory and good value for our three goals.’

They were by the end. But after a dreadful first half, you did rather wonder whether anyone was in the mood to celebrate. It certainly wasn’t a stage fit for international royalty. The pitch looked an utter mess after the NFL series of matches.

It could not explain England’s first-half performance, allowing the game to be played at a pace which suited Slovenia. Possession is all well and good, but means little without intent. England had settled for the safety of the sideways pass

There were occasional flurries of quality. A pass here, a run there; they always ended with a woeful finish or a poor final ball. Their best early moment came on 21 minutes when Jack Wilshere looked up and picked out Danny Welbeck with a raking, lofted ball from deep. He chested the ball down perfectly for Wayne Rooney, but the centurion shot wildly high and wide.

Katanec, who guided his nation to major tournaments in 2000 and 2002, had a clear game plan and his players did not waver early on. Yet they were no innocents abroad; Alex Mertelj crunched into Adam Lallana and later Bostjan Cesar gave the Liverpool player a sly elbow in the face, before proffering apologies. A red card would not have been amiss

That said, England’s willingness to collude with Slovenian needs was depressing. They simply could not create any intensity. Indeed, Milivoje Novakovic went close heading wide from a corner and Slovenia most worrisome first-half moment came when Jasmin Kurtic attempted an unnecessary back pass which had goalkeeper Samir Handanovic scrambling.

At least that gave the Wembley crowd something to cheer. There had been precious little else, so their reaction at half time was extraordinarily benign: a rippling of applause. Better performances than this have seen England subjected to a cascade of boos: either crowds have grown up, or expectations have been managed down.

England did improve and Hodgson must take credit. There is more flexibility about this team. ‘We had two systems of play up our sleeves because we didn't know how the pitch would play,’ said Hodgson. ‘Welbeck went slightly wider, Raheem sent slightly wider, we kept our three in the middle, and it worked well. Danny Welbeck profited strongly from that and we saw a better Raheem Sterling.’

Indeed they did but not before Slovenia had startled England on 56 minutes. Andraz Kim sent in a superb curling crossed free kick. Jordan Henderson rose to make an impact but unfortunately ended up flicking an arching header over his own goalkeeper to score: a striker could not have been more proud.

Slovenia though were undone by their own stupidity, retaining their lead for less than a minute. Rooney seemed ready to them on all alone. Fed by Wilshere, he burst into the box, causing consternation, though in reality, he was heading nowhere dangerous when Cesar panicked and felled him.

A penalty awarded, Wembley chanted for their 100-cap man and he did not disappoint, fairly blasting the spot kick into the corner to the right of Handanovic, who, to his enormous credit, got a strong hand to it. In scoring, Rooney moved on to 44 England goals, level with Jimmy Greaves.

England were a good deal more comfortable on 66 minutes when Lallana executed a lovely turn to engineer a cross which was deflected by Cesar into goalkeeper Handanovic, forcing him to clear unsatisfactorily. The ball was eventually headed out to Welbeck who, despite falling backwards and being unable to make clean contact, did enough to direct it through a crowded penalty area to make it 2-1.

The game finally slipped away from Slovenia on 74 minutes, when Sterling and Welbeck exchanged passes with the Arsenal man left to take a touch and drive a clean finish past Handanovic for 3-1, his fifth goal for England in four games. By then it was hard to remember the dismal start we had endured to the evening. But then again, all the best parties save their best for the finale.
