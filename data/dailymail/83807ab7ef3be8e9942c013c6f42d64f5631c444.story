Chelsea have former favourite son Joe Cole to thank for talisman Eden Hazard strutting his stuff in blue.

Hazard will play a leading role as Chelsea kick off their Champions League campaign against Schalke on Wednesday night, but if it wasn't for ex-Blues hero Cole history may have been different.

The pair played together when Cole was on loan at French side Lille from Liverpool, who he joined after seven years at Chelsea.

Eden Hazard says Joe Cole, who he played with at Lille, encouraged him to join Chelsea

'He said to me before, when we were at Lille, "You have to be at Chelsea, because it is the right club for you,'' Hazard told Sky Sports. 'I said, "Okay, Joe, okay, I will go!'''

And as Hazard targets Champions League glory with Chelsea, the Belgian star insists fans have not yet seen the best of him.

He said: 'I can be better. Last season was very good, and the first season [at Chelsea] as well. Now I am in the third season and if I can win trophies, it could be better.

'Personally, if I continue like this and score more goals and make more assists, but most important is trophies at the end.'
