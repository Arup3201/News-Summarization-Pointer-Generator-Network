Lionel Messi gave Barcelona the narrowest of first-leg leads over Atletico Madrid in their Copa del Rey quarter-final on Wednesday night.

With stalemate looming Barcelona were awarded penalty four minutes from time and, although the Argentine saw his spot kick saved, he rammed home the rebound to give his team the edge ahead of next week’s second leg.

After a cautious start to the game from both sides, Neymar was the first to go close - forcing a save from Jan Oblak. Alongside the Brazilian, Luis Suarez was occupying Uruguayan team-mate Diego Godin and Messi was loitering with intent on the right wing, making a fool of left-back Siqueira whenever he could.

On one foray into a more central position the Argentine almost scored Barcelona’s first. Rakitic's cross was slammed at him at uncontrollable speed but he still killed it dead and got his shot away just over Oblak’s bar.

Alves found Suarez with an equally-awkward pass but the former Liverpool striker couldn’t quite control the ball with Godin in close attendance.

Atletico were not offering too much going forward - but they were forcing set-pieces and corners. Arda Turan went down after being challenged by Rakitic and was struggling to walk when he got back to his feet but he recovered immediately when the rebound from the subsequent free-kick came out to him and he fired it straight back at Marc-Andre Ter Stegen.

Torres was being jeered at every turn. His eight goals in 12 games record against Barca made him a threat but his aim was off in the first half, shooting through Pique’s legs out for a corner and running into the same defender when a misplaced pass from Sergio Busquets played him through.

The other former Liverpool striker - Suarez - was having no more luck. He was hacked down from behind by Godin and the referee waved play-on. To add to his frustration he was then gifted Barca’s best chance of the half from a Rakitic pass but blazed over from the edge of the six-yard box. His name rang around the stadium as supporters did their best to get behind him but the frustration was palpable.

Torres went from Pique’s pocket to the bench for the re-start as Mario Mandzukic came on for the second half. Andres Iniesta had Barcelona’s first chance of the second period but, played in by Neymar, his shot was blocked and sailed into Oblak’s arms.

For Atletico, Mandzukic was having little effect - back-heeling one ball straight out of play - but defensively they were airtight, offering no space to Barcelona’s front three.

Suarez went down under Godin’s challenge on the edge of the area but his appeals for a spot-kick were waved away. He was then booked for appealing for handball from Raul Garcia as the midfielder intercepted his pass to Messi with his arm. Referee Jose Luis Gonzalez Gonzalez was endearing himself to no-one inside the Camp Nou until minute No 86 when he pointed to the spot after Busquets took a tumble.

First he gave a free-kick after Siqueira went through the back of Messi. Then the Argentine’s free-kick was charged down but, in the subsequent melee, Juanfran kicked Busquets and the referee gave a penalty.

Messi’s spot-kick was saved but he calmly tapped in the rebound to settle the first leg.
