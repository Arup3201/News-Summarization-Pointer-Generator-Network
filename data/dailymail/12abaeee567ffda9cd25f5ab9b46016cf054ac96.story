Chilling new details have emerged of the thrill killing of a young Australian man who was out jogging in Oklahoma in August.

One of the teenagers who has confessed to a role in the fatal shooting of Christopher Lane, 22, who was in the US on a baseball scholarship, says he recalls the victim 'screaming' as he was shot.

Three Duncan teenagers were charged in the August 16 shooting of Lane, who was out jogging along a street when he was hit in the back by a bullet.

Killed: Christopher Lane, a baseball player and student, was 'screaming' after he was shot while jogging, according to one of the teenagers accused of his murder

Suspects: Michael Jones (left) is accused of being an accessory to murder while Chancey Luna (center) and James Edwards (right) face first degree murder charges for the shooting of Christopher Lane

Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards Jr., 16, were charged with first-degree murder.

Michael
 Dewayne Jones, 17, was charged with accessory to first-degree murder 
after the fact and use of a vehicle in discharge of a weapon.

In an August 18 interview, Jones admitted he was driving.

‘Jones
 advised that Chancey Luna had fired the shot that struck Christopher 
Lane and that Jones heard Christopher Lane scream as the shot was 
fired,’ an investigator wrote in court papers, according to the Oklahoman.

Police said Jones told investigators that the three were 'bored' and decided to kill someone for the 'fun of it'.

Questionable: Friends claimed Edwards (center) and Luna (right) were trying to join the local chapter 
of the notorious Crips gang, and they posted pictures to their Facebook 
where they are holding gang signs

The
 district attorney investigator, Justin Scott, revealed the new detail 
in several requests made last month to a judge for permission to do 
searches for evidence.

The
 investigator also reported to the judge that Jones claimed he concealed
 the gun several minutes after the shooting in a factory compartment 
under the hood of his Ford Focus.

Lane, a student at East Central University, was killed by a single bullet that hit his back and penetrated both of his lungs and his pulmonary artery, an autopsy has revealed.

The
 state medical examiner's report said 
Lane suffered a single bullet wound, which authorities said came from a 
.22-caliber revolver.

The man who tried to save Chris Lane's life has told how he and two passers-by were there when he took his final gasps of air.

Richard
 Rhodes, a contractor, and his partner Lindsey Moore were working on a 
nearby house when they heard what they thought to be a gunshot.

They
 ran out to the street and saw the black Ford Focus driving away, but 
they didn't begin to understand what happened until they saw a woman 
bent over a ditch.

At first they thought the woman, later
identified as Joyce Smith, had blown a tire of her car but then they 
saw that she was leaning over the body of the Australian student who had
just been out for a jog.

'I was like this, telling him, "buddy, stay with us, stay with us,"' Mr Rhodes told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Ms
Smith was the woman who called 911 and the recording that was released 
shows that she was frantically telling the emergency operator to get 
responders to the scene as soon as possible.

It
is clear from the recording that she was talking to other people at the
scene, and they were the ones to realise that he had been shot.

Lane was lying in a ditch off the side
of the road, and as Mr Rhodes leaned over his body he saw blood coming 
out of the 22-year-olds mouth.

As he lifted up Lane's t-shirt, he saw there was a small gunshot wound in the upper left portion of his back.

It emerged that the day before 
Edwards is alleged to have shot dead Lane in a drive-by from
 a black Ford Focus, he tweeted about rapper Chief Keef.

Two
 days earlier he posted a chilling tweet that was a lyric from the 
rapper's song I Don't Like.

It read: 'With my n****s when it's time to 
start taken life's' (sic). Other lyrics in the same song include 'pistol
 toting and I'm shooting on sight'.

Tough guy: Edwards posted videos of him tossing 
around guns and looking threatening in a blue bandana associated with 
the notorious Crips gang

The boys also posted pictures of 
themselves doing gang signs with their hands, pretending to use wads of 
cash as telephones and posing with guns in social media videos.

Edwards
 also changed his profile picture on August 9 to show his face hidden in
 a blue bandana - typically associated with the Crips and its affiliates
 - and they are active in Oklahoma. Four Crips were indicted on drugs 
charges in Tulsa in June.

But
 Detective John Byers, who is leading the investigation and is the 
town's gang expert, told MailOnline: 'Jones, the white gentleman, I've 
not known him to be claiming to be part of any gang.

'On
 Edward's posts he is throwing up hand signs, but I haven't known him to
 say he's part of any gang - and we have no knowledge of Luna being 
involved with the other two before at all.

'I
 cannot say this is a gang. They knew each other, they hung out. they 
committed crime. Yes, by classification, to be called a gang, they have 
to have some kind of initiation and call themselves a certain name, but 
at this point I can't say they are a gang.

'Social media has played a large part of this investigation.'

Officials believe that Lane was not their first target, though he was their first human victim.

Police
 chief Ford said that during their investigation they found a dead 
donkey that had been killed with a shotgun just a block away from where 
Lane was murdered.

Shock: Residents of Duncan have been moved by the murder that attracted worldwide attention

The small town has been rocked by the 
senseless murder that has sent shockwaves around the world, leaving many
 wondering what drove the 'bored' boys to apparently kill just for the 
thrill of it.

Because 
of Lane's nationality, the case has gained national attention, but some 
have criticized the White House for not reacting strongly enough.

A
 State Department spokeswoman put out a statement last week saying that 
the federal government is 'deeply saddened' by Lane's death but she did 
not comment on any specific action.

Australia's
 former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer called for his fellow 
countrymen to think of this shooting when they are planning a trip to 
the United States.
