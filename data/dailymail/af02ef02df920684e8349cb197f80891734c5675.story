A motorbike-mad cancer victim took her final journey in a fitting fashion - a sidecar hearse.

Helen Hatfield' coffin was accompanied by a procession of Triumphs and Harley Davidsons. She died in February after a 12-year battle with breast cancer.

Miss Hatfield, 53, of Blacon, Chester, fell in love with motorbikes when she was 14 and such was her passion she spent six years in Spain reviewing Triumph motorcycles for the Spanish newspaper the Costa Blanca News with her partner, Keith Lloyd.

Her partner Keith Lloyd opted for the Triumph as the two shared a passion for the motorcycle manufacturer

Yesterday a small procession of Triumphs and Harley Davidsons ridden by Miss Hatfield's close friends followed a Triumph and sidecar hearse through the city centre going past the Town Hall, Bill Smith Motors, a specialist motorcycle shop, and Westminster Park before going to Chester Crematorium for the funeral.

Mr Lloyd, Miss Hatfield's partner for 20 years, said it was a 'fitting tribute' and said he got the idea after seeing it on TV soap Emmerdale.

He said: 'We saw it on Emmerdale and she said it was a good idea. We didn't know anyone who actually did it but I found a company and there was three options for the bike.

'I had to go for the Triumph because we used to review them together.

'She was a wonderful woman and we had so much in common.'

Mr Lloyd said he and Miss Hatfield would ride for hundreds of miles from their home in Calpe, near Benidorm, to Madrid and into the mountains to review the bikes and only stopped when Helen's cancer became worse.

He said: 'While we lived there we had to keep coming back to Britain for her treatment so we ended up moving back.

'In June she had a seizure and that was it really. She died at home on February 27.'

Miss Hatfield, originally from Melton Mowbray, worked in the catering business before moving to Spain with Mr Lloyd.
