Snapchat is looking to raise as much as $500 million in a new funding round that would value the mobile messaging company at up to $19 billion. 

The latest valuation is a massive increase for the company, which Facebook offered to buy for $3 billion in late 2013.

Snapchat's previous funding round, completed late last year, valued the company at more than $10 billion.

Snapchat which seeks to raise venture capital, if successful, could see its valuation shoot to $19 billion

Last year Snapchat leapfrogged Twitter to become the third most used social media app.

Almost a third of 18 to 24-year-olds now use the self-destructing messaging app, which is more than double the amount of users the company had in November.

Facebook still reigns as the most popular, however, with more than 75 per cent of millennials using it, closely followed by Instagram with 43 per cent.

 

Executives of the company, which allows its more than 100 million users to send messages that disappear after a few seconds, are in advanced talks with fund managers, the person told Bloomberg.

The investments being discussed would value Snapchat between $16 billion and $19 billion overall, Bloomberg reported.

Los Angeles-based Snapchat could not be reached immediately for comment.

The drastic increase in valuation comes as Snapchat continues to add to its active user base and extends its service. 

Last month it added it has partnered with 11 of America's top media brands, including DailyMail.com, in order to launch a new in-app news feature that will allow users to access a collection of the day's top stories and videos with just one swipe.

The app's new 'Discover' feature, which launches today, features 12 unique news channels, one for each media partner, plus a dedicated Snapchat channel which will include original content from the app's creators.

All of the media brands will handpick up to 15 different news stories and videos to feature on their own channels every day.

It is also the latest evidence of a surge in venture capital financing for technology companies, that has produced some eye-popping valuations.

Even at $19 billion, Snapchat would only be the third-most valuable tech startup that does not trade its shares publicly. 

According to research firm CB Insights, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is worth $46 billion and app-based taxi service Uber is valued at $41 billion.
