The trail of photos left online by the friends of the Boston Marathon bomber shows that they went on a trip from Massachusetts to New York City in recent months.

There is an eerie shadow over the photos as it was revealed that suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his now-dead brother Tamerlan were plotting to continue their terror streak in Manhattan after killing three and injuring more than 200 in the marathon bombing. 

Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, both Kazakh nationals, and an American friend Robel Phillipos were all arrest on Wednesday for various charges relating to helping their friend 'Jahar' cover up his tracks after the bombing.

Blocks away: Azamat Tazhayakov posted this picture of himself in front of The New York Times headquarters, just blocks from Times Square, on his profile for a Russian social media site

Seeing the sights: Tazhayakov is seen posing in front of the Statue of Liberty with two unidentified friends during the same trip to New York

Kadyrbayev, 19, and Tazhayakov, 20, have profiles on Russian social media site VKontakte that show pictures of themselves touring Manhattan, though it does not appear that Phillipos was on the trip. 

At one point during the trip, which appears to have taken place in April 2012, the group stopped to take the typical tourist shot in front of the Statue of Liberty.

Another stop on their tour was Times Square, where five young men- including Tsarnaev, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov- posed happily.

Different view: Because the charges against the friends, including Tazhayakov on the left, focus on their involvement after the bombings, it does not imply that they had any prior knowledge about the attack- or the Tsarnaev's plot to drive down to Manhattan on the same day and continue their attack

No red flags: Tazahayakov's social media profile does not seem unlike that of many other college-age boys

Tazhayakov also had his picture taken outside of the office of The New York Times, just blocks away from Times Square.

The bustling New York tourist attraction clearly stuck with Tsarnaev, as he and his brother reportedly considered it as a second bombing location.

Following Tamerlan's death during an altercation with police and Dzhokar's arrest, the FBI reported that the pair initially planned on driving the BMW that they hijacked and driving it to New York from Boston but were thwarted by a lack of gas.

Enjoying life: Azamat Tazhayakov posted pictures of himself smoking a hookah pipe (left) and relaxing

Pals: Kadyrbayev (center) and Tazhayakov (right) lived together in an apartment off of the UMASS-Dartmouth campus in New Bedford, though it is unclear where this picture was taken

Connection: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is seen here with Dias Kadyrbayev, and the two reportedly joked about him being the Boston Marathon bomber via text in the days after the attack

Joking: Kadyrbayev, seen with two different friends, told investigators that he thought Tsarnaev was playing around when he sent texts brushing off similarities between himself and the suspected bomber

'Questioning of Dzhokhar revealed that he and his brother decided spontaneously on Times Square as a target,' New York police commissioner Ray Kelly said a news conference with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

'They would drive to Times Square that same night. That plan, however, fell apart when they realized that the vehicle that they hijacked was low on gas and ordered the driver to stop at a nearby gas station.'

Apparently the city left an impression on Tazhayakov as well, as he highlights their group trip.

In addition to pictures from their trip, Tazhayakov posts about songs that he likes- including Green Day's 'When September Ends' and more recently Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' 'Can Not Hold Us', which he added on April 18, just days after the bombing.

Waiting: Dias Kadyrbayev (pictured) is now being held without bail until the May 14 hearing, along with his friends Tazhayakov and Phillipos

Flashy: Kadyrbayev's affinity for nice cars prompted the investigation as he was first questioned by police about his 'humorous' vanity license plates that read 'TERRORISTA#1'

Red flag: Police initially investigated the pair after the discovery of their license plates (pictured) but then held them on immigration charges since they are Kazakh nationals in the country on expired academic visas

On his profile, fellow arrestee Dias Kadyrbayev posted the Times Square group shot, along with another undated picture of himself with Tsarnaev and other friends.

Kadyrbayev also features pictures of himself on a sunny beach, goofing around with a friend while climing in a tree, and posing in a luxury car.

Kadyrbayev's affinity for flashy cars is what got them into trouble in the first place with police, as they were initially questioned when it was revealed that the BMW that had a vanity license plate that read 'TERRORISTA#1'.

His lawyer argued that the plate was a gag gift, police became suspicious and then held both he and Tazhayakov in custody because of immigration issues, as their student visas had expired.

On Wednesday, they both were charged with conspiring to obstruct justice by destroying evidence.

The criminal complaint lists that they removed Dzhokhar's backpack from his room and 'agreed to get rid of it after concluding from news reports that Tsarnaev was one of the Boston Marathon bombers.'

Girlfriend: Though a girl who had a brief romantic relationship with Tsarnaev has come forward, the girl in this picture seen being kissed by Kadyrbayev has not been identified

Mystery woman: The girl seen with Tazhayakov in this picture has not been identified either

The three friends- Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and Phillipos- went over to Tsarnaev's on-campus dormitory after seeing the news reports.

When the group arrived at the dorm, Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text from the bomber that said 'I'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it.'

He did not specify where he was going, but Tazhayakov told investigators that he felt that this meant he would never see Tsarnaev alive again.

They were let in the room by Dzhokhar's roommate, who said that Dzhokhar had been there just a few hours earlier.

The criminal complaint says that when there, the three friends watched a movie. 

Kadyrbayev 'knew' that Tsarnaev was involved in the fatal attack when he saw the empty fireworks in the dorm room.
