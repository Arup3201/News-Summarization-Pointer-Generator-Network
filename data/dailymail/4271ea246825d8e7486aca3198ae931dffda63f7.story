Dog walkers have been left stunned by the discovery of sausages which were laced with nails and scattered around a popular park.

Anti-animal cruelty charity Peta is offering a reward of up to £1,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the culprit.

Around 40 cooked cocktail sausages embedded with up to ten one-inch long metal nails have been found and could be lethal for any animal attempting to eat them.

Police in Abergavenny, South Wales, have warned dog walkers to be vigilant after the sausages were discovered on playing fields popular with the pet owners.

Peta spokesman Ben Williamson said: 'It is imperative that any community faced with such horrific abuse of animals take measures to find the culprit or culprits and stop the violence.

'Animal abusers are a danger to everyone - they take their issues out on whoever is available to them, human or non-human.'

Vet Ben Hynes said he was 'shocked and appalled' after being shown some of the potentially deadly sausages.

He added: 'Had it not been for these extremely observant people out walking their own dogs, we could have easily seen a spate of dogs facing a slow, but certain death.

'Luckily we haven’t had any emergencies but if we had, the animals would have been suffering from vomiting, bleeding and I have no doubt the result would have been fatal.

'There is absolutely no way that this can be anything other than the intention to kill animals.'

One shocked dog walker, who asked not to be named, said he noticed the sun reflecting off a nail in one of the sausages.

He said: 'My dog, which was on a lead, started to sniff at a sausage on the ground, but I immediately pulled him back when I saw something shining back at me.

'On closer inspection I realised that it had about nine or ten nails in it and thought that this was no coincidence.

'I looked around and found a lot more of these sausages - I must have collected close to 40. I have been extra diligent while out walking my dogs since.'

A police spokesman said: 'This is a very worrying incident, especially as they are being left on playing fields where not only dogs but children could be harmed by these sausages.'
