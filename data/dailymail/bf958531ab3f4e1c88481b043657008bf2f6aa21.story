For a man with such a daunting in-tray as new boss of the BBC, it was a bizarre performance to say the least.

As he took over as director general yesterday, Tony Hall was about to be confronted by a report into Jimmy Savile’s sex abuse, a review into bullying and harassment within the corporation, on-going industrial disputes and tough financial cuts.

The 62-year-old nevertheless decided it was the perfect time to fool around for the cameras.

Tony Hall, former chief Executive of the Royal 
Opera House, made sure everyone was watching as he began his role as the
Director General at the BBC

The Lord seemed in high spirits as he larked about in front of new Broadcasting House on his first day

Lord Hall posed for the media at the entrance of the BBC’s new Broadcasting House yesterday morning.

As photographers called out his name,
requesting him to stand in different positions, he dithered over which 
direction to go and ended up apparently playing the clown – almost 
appearing to dance.

During his tour of TV news studios, 
the man charged with mending the corporation’s battered reputation 
denied the BBC was a ‘Left of centre’ organisation and said audience 
trust in the broadcaster was ‘climbing back’.

A former chief executive of the Royal
Opera House, who began as a BBC trainee 40 years ago, Lord Hall said he
had known ‘absolutely nothing’ about Savile’s activities when he used 
to work at the corporation, in its news division.

He singled out current shows for praise including Doctor Who, The Voice and the Bach ‘marathon’ on Radio 3.

The new DG sent an encouraging email to staff, telling them he believed the BBC's best days 'lay ahead'

All smiles: Tony Hall has a mammoth task ahead of him

One of his first actions in the 
£450,000-a-year job yesterday was to send an email to all of the 
corporation’s staff in which he suggested ‘the BBC’s best days lie ahead
of us’.

His arrival comes after predecessor 
George Entwistle lasted just 54 days in the role, after he became 
embroiled first in the Jimmy Savile controversy and then the bungled 
Newsnight report into Lord McAlpine, which wrongly linked the peer to 
historic sex abuse claims. 

The Savile crisis was hugely damaging
for the corporation’s reputation and, alongside on-going cuts, has left
a legacy of low morale at the broadcaster.

Yesterday the new director general 
warned staff he took a ‘very dim view’ of anything that got in the way 
of team-work and was ‘intolerant’ of anything that stopped it making 
‘great programmes’.

While his response about team-work 
came to a question about the bullying and harassment review, it is 
understood he has also told top bosses at the broadcaster they must talk
to each other.

Lord Hall will now be faced with the difficult task of leading the BBC as it seeks to restore its reputation

One of the key criticisms about the 
BBC during the Savile crisis was that executives worked in ‘silos’ and 
did not properly inform each other of what was going on at the 
corporation.

Vile Jimmy Savile prompted a huge scandal at the BBC

Lord Hall was challenged by Sky News 
presenter Adam Boulton about the recent appointment of former Labour 
minister James Purnell to a senior role at the BBC and asked if the 
corporation was a ‘Left of centre’ organisation.

The director general said ‘no’ before
saying he had brought in Mr Purnell, who used to work at the 
broadcaster, to ‘shape the strategy for the BBC going forward’.

When he was asked if the BBC needed 
more money when charter renewal comes in a few years, the BBC boss 
added: ‘At the moment I don’t know the answer to that.

‘What I do know is that it would be a
mistake to try to reopen any negotiations about money at the moment, 
because of the economy and people out there are going through some very,
very hard times.’

He said that the Savile crisis had 
been ‘a tough time for the BBC’ but ‘an even tougher time for those 
directly affected by what happened’.

Lord Hall also declared himself a fan
of a wide range of BBC shows, claiming he had enjoyed seeing Matt get 
picked to go through in Saturday’s opening episode of The Voice and 
praised the ‘wonderful sharp form’ of Doctor Who.

The BBC's image has been tarnished by a string of incidents in the past year.

Last week, the BBC was hit by unions protesting at the Delivering Quality First (DQF) programme which will lead to 2,000 job losses at the corporation.

A strike by journalists and technical staff in a row over jobs, workload and claims of bullying caused well-known shows to be dropped on Good Friday.

The strike, from 12pm until midnight, led to the cancellation of BBC 2's Newsnight, Radio 4's PM and the World Tonight.

Since October, more than 850 BBC employees have come forward to raise concerns about bullying and sexual harassment at the corporation.

The staff members have contacted private consultants brought in by the BBC as part of an internal inquiry set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

The Rose Review, overseen by human rights lawyer Dinah Rose QC, was launched last year following a wave of damaging claims from female presenters who said they were routinely groped while working for the BBC.

In December 2011 the BBC dropped a Newsnight investigation into Savile's years of sex attacks.

Last year it was revealed that hundreds of people came forward alleging that they had been abused by Savile and other high-profile figures.

The Pollard Review, an inquiry into how the BBC handled the Savile affair, reveals better leadership could have prevented 'chaos and confusion' at BBC over the DJ scandal scandal.

Another low-key entrance: Alan Yentob, the BBC Creative Director, seen arriving at Broadcasting House, certainly knows how to catch the eye on his blue bicycle
