A doctor who was running as a Libertarian candidate for U.S. Senate has died in a plane crash.

Dr Douglas Butzier, a 59-year-old married dad-of-two, was the pilot of a single-engine Piper PA-46 that crashed about a mile north of  Dubuque Regional Airport in Iowa around 11pm on Monday.

Butzier, who had taken off from Ankeny Regional Airport around 10pm, had missed the first approach to the runway and crashed while approaching for a second time, KCRG reported.

Butzier, who was the only person in the aircraft, was running for U.S. Senate against Democratic U.S. Representative Bruce Braley and Republican state Senator Joni Ernst.

Loss: Dr Doug Butzier, pictured with his wife Ann, has died after crashing his single-engine plane a mile from Dubuque Regional Airport in Iowa. He was running as a Libertarian candidate for U.S. Senate

On Monday night, debris from the small plane could be seen on the ground at the base of a tree near the 8700 block of Military Road. 

The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the crash but a cause has not yet been determined.

KCRG reported that around an inch and half of rain had fallen on the area throughout the day, but it was not yet clear if the weather played a role in the crash.  

Butzier, who  married wife Ann in 2010, had two sons from a previous marriage and three stepchildren. He had worked as an emergency room physician at Mercy Medical Center-Dubuque for 17 years. 

Scene: First responders work early on Tuesday morning at the crash scene. The cause is under investigation

Tragedy: It is not yet known if the heavy rain that fell in the area on Monday had anything to do with the crash

The Washington Post reported that Butzier was a long-shot to win against Ernst and Braley.

After the news of his death, Ernst expressed her condolences on Twitter.

'Deeply saddened by tragic news of Dr. Doug Butzier,' she wrote. 'Gail&I will keep Doug’s family in our thoughts&prayers as they mourn their untimely loss.'

Braley said in a statement that he was 'shocked and saddened to hear of the sudden and tragic death of Doug Butzier'.

'I have enormous respect for anyone who puts their name forward as a candidate for public office,' he wrote. 'Carolyn and I send our thoughts and prayers to Dr. Butzier’s wife and family during this difficult time.'

Proud: Butzier, pictured, believed citizens should decide what was in their best interest, rather than the government. He was considered a long-shot for the seat but was well respected by his opponents

In a profile in the Des Moines Register that was published just six days ago, Butzier said he believed the government needed to be reduced in size to tackle federal debt.

'You are best at deciding what is in your best interest, not a Washington bureaucrat doing central planning,' he said.

The profile explains that he had long been involved in community activities, including youth soccer and basketball, and volunteering.

He also served as the medical director for the Dubuque and Asbury fire departments. 

'Doug touched many lives and will be greatly missed. He was a great guy,' family spokesman and family medicine doctor Tom Schreiber told THMedia.
