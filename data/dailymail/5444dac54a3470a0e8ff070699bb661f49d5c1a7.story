Every year tens of thousands of people have nips and tucks in the pursuit of the perfect body.

Unfortunately, while business is booming, so too are shoddy techniques, as the plastic surgery industry is unregulated. Of the 100,000 procedures performed in the UK last year, five per cent ended with botched results. 

Now, a documentary team has gone behind the scenes at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and met patients desperate to have their cosmetic catastrophes corrected.

They reveal a horrifying picture of butchered breasts, deformed faces and unsightly scars.

Claire, from Essex, had a breast reduction that went horribly wrong. She explains the terrible complications she experienced after her surgery and, pictured right, the bandage that covered her resulting open wound

Claire, a cleaner from Essex, had thought having breast reduction would make her life easier, but suffered from a complication that left her with rotten tissue and open wounds.

'It was horrendous. It was like a crater of just open flesh,' she said.

'The nipple was just standing on its own. I was really scared at one point that I would lose my right breast.'

Claire had felt self-conscious about her large breasts since her early 20s. Her family paid for her to have the longed-for surgery as a 40th birthday present.

'I was very excited. I was really over the moon. It was going to be a brand new start,' she said.

However, just two days after the operation she noticed her right nipple had darkened and the surrounding area had turned blue. She was suffering from necrosis, when breast tissue begins to die after it is deprived from oxygen.

It left her with open wounds on both breasts. She will have reconstructive surgery once they have healed, a process which may take another two years.

'You feel like you've been mutilated at times and that's quite a difficult thing to cope with - especially when you know it was your decision,' she said.

Surgeon Nick Percival, who treated Claire, said: 'People always 
assume they will be in the 95 per cent who don't have problems but the only people who 
are 100 per cent safe are those who don't have surgery.'

He added: 'To choose to
have cosmetic surgery and then to suffer a complication is a shattering blow.
When every day things seem to be getting worse it is important to
have reassurance from your surgeon that he or she has experience of dealing
with problems like yours and it will get better in time'

And it's not just women who suffer. The second part of the documentary, due to be broadcast next week, tells the story of Mark from Liverpool who has the same disastrous reaction to breast reduction surgery.

Mark was left with what he called a 'pepperoni nipple' following a disastrous breast reduction. He is considering having a prosthetic nipple implanted once his scars have healed

The 38-year-old's left nipple fell 
off as a result of suffering necrosis. He then opted for a skin graft, 
which also failed and left him with a 'pepperoni nipple'.

'It looks like I've been attacked by a shark,' he said.

His scars are still currently 
healing, and after consulting with surgeons, he is considering having a 
prosthetic nipple attached. He said this could give him the confidence 
to take his top off at the beach or during football practice with his 
friends.

Breast surgery is the most common cosmetic procedure in the UK, with 10,000 breast enlargements and 4,500 breast reductions taking place every year.

Louise, a mother-of-five was one such woman who decided to have her sagging breasts lifted to boost her confidence.

But the 33-year-old from Manchester was horrified when her breasts were left extremely lopsided and excruciating to touch.

'I can't take my children 
swimming or hug them,' she said.

'I get pain in my right breast and it's rock solid at 
the top. It's just ruined my life.'

She had an extreme form of capsular contraction, the most common complication with breast surgery where scar tissue around the implants hardens and contract. This can occur at any time after the operation.

Surgeons carefully removed her implants, followed by the capsule of scar tissue from her breasts. After flushing out the area they then lifted each breast in turn and put in new implants.

But the drama wasn't yet over for Louise.
 She complained of extreme leg pain as she awoke from the operation and 
surgeons realised she was suffering from compartment syndrome.

This extreme reaction to an operation occurs when there is not enough blood flowing to the limb. If
 untreated, it can cause muscles to die and may even lead to amputation.
 She underwent another operation to reduce the pressure on her leg 
muscles and was given extra oxygen. Thankfully, her condition improved.

Another growing problem for surgeons is the rise of bargain basement facelifts.

Sarah, a 37-year-old student from the Middle East, had £3,000 injections to plump up her cheeks when she was 30.

'Everyone told me I didn't need filler and my face was very nice but I didn't care, I decided to have it,' she admitted.'

A
 year later they the filler began to move and left her in permanent 
pain. Her face was no longer balanced and she was left with unsightly 
lumps under the skin. She came forward for help after suffering three 
facial infections in the past year.

'I wish I had never had filler. I'm very worried and afraid that I will be left with scars,' she said.

A scan of her face revealed she had been injected with lakes of cheap permanent filler, which wouldn't dissolve away.

Surgeons guided
 a needle into her cheek using ultrasound and tried to remove the filler
 using a syringe.

However, when this didn't work they had to make two 
small incisions and squeeze out the filler. The operation cost £4,500 
but at last her face is symmetrical and healing well.

Leading cranio-facial surgeon Niall 
Kirkpatrick at The Chelsea 
and Westminster Hospital, said the cases highlighted the pressing need to regulate the private sector.

He said: 'If we do not act to regulate the private sector this is 
the future for the NHS.  The strain is just too much, not only on the 
NHS – hospitals and GP’s – but on the economy.  Private cosmetic surgery
 is rife for abuse without proper regulations; this is a serious problem
 that will not go away.'

Jazz Gowans, Managing Director at Transparent Television, who produced the documentary said: 'What is incredibly eye opening about this series is the pure power of anyone in a white coat... the trust that we all put in surgeons is rife for abuse in the wrong hands. 

'People are still making mistakes and not asking questions or doing their research which means we are all sadly seeing an increasing element of our society, a generation of men and women, that will be disfigured forever.'The first of two episodes of 'Botched Up Bodies' will air on Channel 5 at 10pm tonight
