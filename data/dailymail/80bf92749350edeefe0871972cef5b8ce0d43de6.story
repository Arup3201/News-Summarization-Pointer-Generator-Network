Alan Pardew was still absorbing the impact of Peter Crouch’s goal when lightning flashed over the Britannia Stadium and the rumble of thunder drowned the sound of ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’.

A storm is breaking over the Newcastle manager right now. Another defeat reopens the debate over his future, not that the subject was ever really closed.

Indeed, Newcastle owner Mike Ashley kept his manager’s position in the news at the weekend by telling a reporter that Pardew would be ‘dead, finished and over’ if the team were beaten at Stoke. 

Ashley insists he was joking but the 1,751 in the away end, however, were not laughing on Monday night.

Before a ball had been kicked they unfurled a ‘Pardew is a muppet’ banner, while ‘Sack Pardew’ cards — left over from the 2-2 draw with Hull last weekend — were also scattered among the travelling contingent.

It was during this fixture last season, a 1-0 win for Stoke in April, that fans rounded on Pardew. On that occasion, though, he was serving a touchline ban for butting Hull’s David Meyler and so was spared their scorn on the walk from dugout to tunnel.

There was no hiding last night and, on half-time, they called for his head as he passed in front of them.

It is easy to see why. For since Newcastle smashed Stoke 5-1 at St James’ Park on Boxing Day, Pardew’s side have won just five of 27 Premier League games. That is a return of 19 points from a possible 81.

Pardew remains defiant. ‘I was born battle-hard so that comes natural to me,’ he said. ‘It’s been tough because you want the fans to be behind you. They are questioning everything I do and that’s understandable, but I have to remain strong and makes sure I’m giving the team everything I can.’

Pardew’s fortitude is academic, however. It is whether Ashley is willing to remain strong in his support. He was here to witness this latest defeat and looked far from his ‘jokey’ self.

No, there will be few smiling on Tyneside and, as another storm cloud gathers, Pardew is once again the lightning rod for supporter unrest.
