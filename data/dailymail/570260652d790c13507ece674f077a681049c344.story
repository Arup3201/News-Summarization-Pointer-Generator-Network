Max Chilton is planning on an 'awesome' British Grand Prix weekend in a bid to raise his stock and profile further in Formula One.

Of the three Britons on the grid at present, Chilton unsurprisingly remains the least well known in comparison to former world champions Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button.

The 23-year-old has so far spent a season and a half in F1 learning his trade with back-of-the-grid team Marussia, although improvements have been made this year as the Banbury-based marque are nudging the midfield pack.

This weekend's race at Silverstone at least offers Chilton the chance in front of his home crowd to prove he is not merely a driver that makes up the numbers.

'I love the circuit. Silverstone is old school, although it has been renovated quite a lot,' said Chilton.

'But you still have some really cool corners - Maggotts, Becketts are awesome. You'd never get bored of going through there flat in an F1 car.

'It's just an awesome home race, and not one of those where there are few spectators. It's one of the most watched of the year.

'You have all the campers, the helicopters coming in and out, and it's a really good buzz over the whole weekend.

'It's just a good fun weekend, and I'd like to think it will be a good one for us.

'Last year, around Silverstone, Caterham started to catch us up. They were probably a little stronger, but we managed to out-race them - just!

'So if we beat them last year when it wasn't a particularly great time for us, then as we're quite a way ahead of them at the moment we should have had a good weekend.

'But that was last year. I just hope we can carry that on into this year.'

Chilton has finished 13th on two occasions, and also 14th this year, a reasonable return from the eight races to date.

Whilst there is unlikely to be 'Max-mania' at Silverstone, Chilton at least feels he is now making his mark on the sport and becoming more recognised.

'My profile is something that's improved since I've been in F1,' added Chilton.

'Being on the parade laps I've seen the occasional Chilton flag, so that's gone up a bit more, which is nice.

'Definitely more people are aware. The longer you are in something the more they pick up on a name. It has built as you would expect.'

'Hopefully the Brits will be behind me this year. It's just a shame the Tour de France starts in Yorkshire this weekend.

'But it's two different sort of sports that shouldn't really affect the grand prix.'

With mixed conditions expected at Silverstone again this weekend, that may yet play into Chilton's hands when it comes to a positive result.

Chilton said: 'Results are determined by the attrition in a race. If there is no attrition we'll be happy with 17th, 18th.

'If there is high attrition, it rains, people have split strategies then you don't know.

'Qualifying is our usual target because it's one where we can plan, so if we can get into Q2 (the middle session of qualifying) then that would be awesome.'
