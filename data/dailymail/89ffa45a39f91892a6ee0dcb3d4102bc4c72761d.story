It doesn't debut until next month, but the Fox sitcom 'Dads' is already taking heat in early reviews for being crass, sexist and racially insensitive.

Critics who’ve watched the pilot episode have been highly critical of the tone of the show, accusing it of relying on ‘poop jokes and sexy Asian schoolgirl jokes’ for cheap laughs.

The show stars Seth Green and Giovanni Ribisi as successful video game developers and roommates whose lives are unexpectedly changed when their politically incorrect fathers move in with them.

Bad dads: Fox's new sitcom has been accusing of relying on 'poop jokes and sexy Asian schoolgirl jokes'

The dads are played by Martin Mull and Peter Riegert.

The series is executive produced by Seth MacFarlane, whose animated comedies, including ‘Family Guy,’ have been regularly accused of bad taste, yet are also extremely popular.

Critics have wasted no time in lambasting the show.

Jace Lacob of BuzzFeed tweeted: ‘The worst part of #Dads is that it is casually racist AND horrifically unfunny. Which is not a good combination, really.’

NPR's Linda Holmes explained that ‘it's mostly nasty about women of color.’

The show is filmed before a live studio audience but even that has been criticized.

'Having people braying at “ironic” racism makes it real racism,' wrote critic Todd VanDerWerff. 

The stars and producers of ‘Dads’ faced reporters Thursday and attempted to defend the show by claiming that it focused on human frailties for the sake of laughs and enlightenment.

At the Television Critics Association meeting, they vowed to tweak the tone of the series as appropriate as the season unfolds.

However a critical mauling doesn't mean a show it destined to fail, 'Two Broke Girls' and 'The Big Bang Theory' are shows critics love to hate, but the general public just seem to love.

'Dads' is set to premiere Sept. 17.
