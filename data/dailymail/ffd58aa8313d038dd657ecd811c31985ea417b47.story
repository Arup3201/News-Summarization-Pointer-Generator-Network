Much has changed in the past 20 years, but one thing that hasn't is Paris's knack for perplexing the visitor. Last Tuesday, tourists who had journeyed tens of thousands of miles from rural China, urban Brazil or remote Australia to absorb the wonders of the Louvre museum found only one marvel for their delectation: a closed sign.

On Tuesdays, for reasons best known to itself, the Louvre takes the day off (most major Paris attractions close on either Monday or Tuesday).

Last month Beyoncé and Jay Z paid good money to have the Louvre entirely to themselves for a visit with their daughter Blue Ivy (a Mona Lisa selfie was their highlight). Maybe they should simply have tried to sneak in on a Tuesday - they'd have saved themselves a lot of loot.

This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Eurostar high-speed rail service between London and Paris

A crowning glory: The Louvre Museum is more accessible thanks to the Eurostar. Just don't go on a Tuesday

And in the area of dining out, Paris also continues to march to the beat of its own drum.

In most countries in the world these days, any visitor to a capital city can bank on enjoying a meal whenever the mood takes them. Not in Paris: bars, brasseries, restaurants and cafes dish out food only when the mood takes them. Best of luck if you're looking for a meal before 7.30pm. 

This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Eurostar high-speed rail service between London and Paris, which can take as little as two hours 15 minutes. I find that especially extraordinary because I travelled on the very first service (along with a carriage load of Mail on Sunday readers).

A changing of the guard: The Eurostar terminal has helped to revitalise London's grand old St Pancras station

Jeffrey Archer - a fellow passenger - may know a thing or two about writing bestsellers, but when it came to using a French payphone he was absolutely hopeless. One of my abiding memories of travelling on that inaugural Eurostar service on November 14, 1994 was standing with Lord Archer on the concourse at Gare du Nord, and having to show him how to make a phone call home.

'Merci, merci,' he kept saying to me, clearly labouring under the misapprehension I was a helpful local (there may well be helpful locals in Paris, but I've yet to meet one!).

There were other 'celebs' on the train but the only other one I can recall was the late Jeremy Beadle.

In truth the launch of Eurostar was a bit of a damp squib. The service should have begun in May that year but had to be delayed. Its inaugural journey took place in the same week as the start of the National Lottery (and shortly after peace broke out in Northern Ireland, further eclipsing the Channel Tunnel). Looking back, one might have expected the incredible engineering achievement of the Tunnel - for the first time linking the UK with the Continent - to have hogged the headlines.

The sudden prospect of peace and people like you and me becoming instant millionaires proved rather more thrilling to news editors, however.

Full speed ahead: The advent of the Eurostar service means that London and Paris are not just two hours apart

Iconic: Paul Day's St Pancras sculpture 'The Meeting Place' is now a recognisable part of a Eurostar journey

And over the past 20 years the Channel Tunnel has never captured the hearts of the British public in the way, for example, that another Anglo-French project did: Concorde. Both were money pits but while Concorde (about £1billion) proved an enormous commercial flop, the Channel Tunnel (about £5billion) has, albeit only in recent years, been more of a success.

By the time I travelled on the inaugural service, I had already been through the Tunnel, travelling twice on a 'preview' of the clumsily titled Le Shuttle service for cars.

And a few years before the start of passenger rail services, I had been through the Tunnel when it was just a hole in the ground. Invited by Eurotunnel's commercial director, Christopher Garnett, to join the then Transport Minister Roger Freeman on an unprecedented adventure, we descended to the Tunnel entrance in Folkestone via a lift. 

Exclusive access: Beyonce and Jay-Z were in Paris last month, and paid for a private viewing at the Louvre

At the bottom we climbed aboard a primitive workman's train for a slow ride through what was to become the service tunnel. At the halfway point, we reached a padlocked gate that marked the frontier between Britain and France. Someone was on hand to unlock it: here we left the British train to board a French one which continued to Sangatte, where a lift took us back up to the surface for a hovercraft ride home.

I had seen the future of travel to the Continent and it worked. Apres moi, I might have said, le deluge. Who could fail to be excited by this major advance in foreign travel? Sadly, rather a lot of people.

In pre-steam days 200 years ago, getting from London to Paris was an uncertain business: a journey that could be counted in days rather than hours. If the wind was really playing up, you wouldn't get to France at all. Even the introduction of steam ships in the mid-19th Century didn't make the journey much better. A long train journey from London, a longer rail trip on the other side of the Channel.

In the post-Second World War era, the first class Golden Arrow Rail Service from Victoria to Paris took at least six hours, often much longer. That hardly compares with Eurostar's St Pancras to Gare du Nord in just over two hours.

A towering attraction: Parisian sights such as the Eiffel Tower are now within day-trip range of London

My first trip to France in 1962 was on a worn-out car ferry from Dover to Dunkirk.

I fell in love with Paris on that visit and, over the years, while having had plenty of reasons to abandon the relationship (the worst public row I have ever had in my life was with a ticket seller at the Louvre), I have remained steadfast.

In truth, Paris has had its share of ups and downs in the past 50 years. The city began a period of reinvention with the opening of the Pompidou Centre, followed by a vigorous period of reconstruction leading up to the 200th anniversary of the Republic in 1989, which saw the building of the famous Louvre pyramid, the opening of the Musee d'Orsay and the Arche de la Defense. And the city had pointed the way towards urban regeneration with the redevelopment of Les Halles.

After this frantic rebuilding, it seemed that Paris ran out of steam. During the past 20 years, it is London that has been the hotbed of reconstruction and redevelopment - including that shining star for Eurostar passengers: St Pancras.

John Lewis boss Andy Street spoke an uncomfortable truth when he described France as 'a country in decline' and called the Gare du Nord 'the squalor pit of Europe'. The Paris Metro system 20 years ago felt modern and efficient; today it seems chaotic and a bit seedy. But contrary to Mr Street's view, Paris is showing many signs of recovery.

Always a pleasure: Paris may not have changed much in the last 20 years - but its scenery hardly needs to

New hotels are opening at a pace - including the Shangri-La, Peninsula, Raffles, Royal Monceau, Mandarin Oriental. (The Plaza Athenee recently reopened, while two old favourites, the Crillon and the Ritz, are currently undergoing lavish refurbishments).

After a five-year closure, the city's Picasso Museum has reopened. Also open again is the modern art collection of the Palais de Tokyo, a stone's-throw from the Eiffel Tower, which is celebrating its new (underwhelming) glass floor. Much more impressive is Frank Gehry's wonderful Louis Vuitton art gallery, which has opened in the Bois de Boulogne.

Paris's charm, however, lies in its small things. The main one is that it is a place of manageable proportions. Paris has just two million people, a quarter the size of London. It's estimated that at any one time, for every Parisian you'll see on the streets, there are three tourists.

Because of its size, you can walk everywhere: from the Pompidou Centre to the Eiffel Tower is about three miles - a stroll of less than an hour. Your walk will take longer because, inevitably, you will be sidetracked by a shop, a bar, a cafe or a marker explaining the history of a site you are passing.

Twenty years ago, leaving Jeffrey Archer to his phone call, I jumped in a taxi and travelled the short distance to Montmartre and gazed across the city from the Sacre-Coeur. I was probably the first person ever to have enjoyed this view after travelling from London all the way by train. That sense of excitement has never gone away. I encourage you to discover it for yourself. 

Eurostar (www.eurostar.com, 08432 186186) offers return fares to Paris from £69 per person. This winter, Eurostar will operate fast services to Geneva, changing at Lille.

Next May it introduces direct services to Marseille and, following the introduction of new trains, to Amsterdam in late 2016.

Room rates at the gloriously situated Mandarin Oriental - on the Rue St-Honore - start at £743 a night, with breakfast. Visit www.mandarinoriental.com/paris or call 00 33 1 70 98 78 88.
