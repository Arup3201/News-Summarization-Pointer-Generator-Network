Liverpool  will begin construction early next year on an extension of Anfield that could potentially see more than 13,000 seats added.

Liverpool won permission to extend their iconic home's current 45,500 capacity after plans were unanimously backed on Tuesday to begin the first phase of adding 8,500 seats to the Main Stand.

The redevelopment will come at a cost of £75million in time for the start of the 2016/17 Premier League season, before Liverpool will look to add 4,800 more  to make Anfield a 58,800-seater stadium.

Liverpool Football Club is soon to add more seats to its famous and iconic home Anfield - to look like this

45,522 - Anfield's current capacity

54,000 - Anfield's guaranteed new capacity 

58,800 - Anfield's potential capacity

8,500 - Phase one to extend the Main Stand

4,800 - Phase two to extend Anfield Road End

22 - how many months it may take to complete

26 to 45 -  Main Stand height change (metres)

£75m - cost of extension by 2016/17 season 

£260m - cost of overall regeneration in Anfield

Votes to defer the plans were outnumbered five to one at a planning meeting on Tuesday, and Liverpool will first extend the Main Stand to bring their capacity to about 54,000.

Then, last season's Premier League runners up intend to  reach the 58,800 mark by adding to the Anfield Road End in the second phase.

Phase two is yet to be granted but Joe Anderson, the Mayor of Liverpool, said: 'This is a very important milestone in our ambitions to transform the Anfield area, bringing new jobs, investment and housing.

'The overall regeneration will see £260m invested in Anfield. Liverpool Football Club's proposals for the stadium are a key part of this. 

'The club is a major employer in the area and its stadium is a major draw for tourists and visitors.' 

1. 75,731 - Old Trafford, Manchester United

2. 60,362 - Emirates Stadium, Arsenal

3. 52,405 - St James' Park, Newcastle United

4. 48,707 - Stadium of Light, Sunderland 

5. 46,708 - Etihad Stadium, Manchester City* 

6. 45,522 - Anfield, Liverpool 

*Manchester City's stadium is due to increase to about 60,000 from August 2015

The club will still be able to use Anfield for matches while construction work continues for about 22 months, and Liverpool intend to add a Hillsborough Memorial as part of the scheme.

Liverpool's chief executive officer, Ian Ayre, added: '(Tuesday's) approval by the Planning Committee is another step on our journey which we embarked on nearly two years ago.

'We've received very positive support for our proposals during a public consultation exercise earlier this year and whilst we are delighted about the progress made today, there are still some steps that we need to navigate through in order to give us the certainty that we need to proceed with our expansion plans.' 

The main objections at the planning meeting on Tuesday were traffic, transport concerns and anger at the dereliction that has blighted the area to get to this stage.
