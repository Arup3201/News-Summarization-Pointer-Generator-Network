A man who claims Chicago police tortured him until he confessed to a rape he didn't commit walked out of jail smiling Wednesday, a free man for the first time in 30 years.

Stanley Wrice, 59, gave a thumbs up as he was released from the Pontiac Correctional Center after Cook County Judge Richard Walsh overturned his conviction this week saying officers lied about how they treated him.

The ruling was just the latest development in one of the darkest chapters of Chicago Police Department history, in which officers working under former Lt. Jon Burge were accused of torturing suspects into false confessions and torturing witnesses into falsely implicating people in crimes.

Freed: Stanley Wrice, 59, is all smiles and is greeted with applause as he walks out of Pontiac Correctional Center on Wednesday after serving 30 years for a crime he confessed to after being tortured by police

Big smiles: Wrice has been granted a new trial after a judge ruled that officers who performed his 1982 interrogation lied about their conduct. Here, Wrice smiles with his layer Heidi Linn Lambros, left, and his daughter Gail Lewis

Not alone: Wrice was sentenced to 100 yeas in prison in 1982 after he says two former officers beat him with a flashlight and a 20-inch piece of rubber Â¿ the same weapons, lawyers say the two implicated cops used on others

Wrice has insisted for years that he confessed to the 1982 sexual assault after officers beat him in the groin and face.

And a witness testified at a hearing Tuesday that he falsely implicated Wrice in the rape after two Chicago police officers under Burge's command tortured him.

Wrice was sentenced to 100 years in prison.

One of Wrice's attorneys, Heidi Linn 
Lambros, said that when Walsh's ruling was announced, Wrice 'squeezed my
 hand and looked at me with tears in his eyes and said he owed me a 
dollar,' a reference to the bet she made with Wrice recently that she 
would have him home by Christmas.

Past: It is the latest development in one of the darkest chapters of Chicago Police Department history, in which officers working under former Lt. Jon Burge, pictured, were accused of torturing suspects into false confessions

Now
 that Walsh has ordered Wrice's release, it will be up to a special 
prosecutor to decide whether to retry him. The special prosecutor did 
not return a call seeking comment Tuesday evening.

With
 his release, Wrice will join a number of men who in recent years have 
been released from prison because they were tortured into confessing at 
the hands of Burge's men.

Dozens
 of men - almost all of them black - have claimed that, starting in the 
1970s, Burge and his officers beat or shocked them into confessing to 
crimes ranging from armed robbery to murder.

Ongoing: Stanley Wrice walks free after 30 years, accompanied by his son-in-law Cashell Lewis, left, and his attorney Jennifer Bonjean. The officers implicated in the case refused to testify at Tuesday's hearing, citing their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination

Thumbs up: Wrice drove away into a world that has changed in innumerable ways since he was put away in 1982

Wrice testified Tuesday that two former officers beat him with a flashlight and a 20-inch piece of rubber - the same weapons, Lambros said, that others have said the two used on them to get them to confess to crimes or implicate others in crimes they did not commit.

The officers refused to testify at Tuesday's hearing, citing their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

No Chicago police officers have ever been convicted of torturing suspects, but Burge was convicted in 2010 for lying in a civil suit when he said he'd never witnessed or participated in the torture of suspects.

He is serving a 4 1/2-year sentence in federal prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. Chicago also has paid out millions of dollars to settle lawsuits in cases related to Burge.

The torture allegations also were a factor in former Illinois Gov. George Ryan's decision to institute a moratorium on the death penalty in 2000. Gov. Pat Quinn abolished the death penalty in 2011.

Emotional: Wrice appeared to wipe away tears as he stood on the free side of Pontiac Correctional Center for the first time in 30 years on Wednesday

Top of the world: Wrice had only a box of possessions with him as he walked out of prison on Wednesday. Wrice joins a number of men who in recent years have been released from prison because they were tortured into confessing at the hands of Burge's men
