Liberia, the hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic ravaging west Africa, should brace for thousands of new cases in coming weeks, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned today.

'Many thousands of new cases are expected in Liberia over the coming three weeks,' the UN health agency said in a statement.

The death toll from the deadliest Ebola epidemic the world has ever seen, which is spreading across west Africa, with Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone the worst hit, has topped 2,000, out of nearly 4,000 people infected.

Liberia already accounts for about half of all cases and deaths, and 'the number of new cases is increasing exponentially,' the WHO warned.

Key development partners trying to help Liberia respond to the outbreak 'need to prepare to scale up their current efforts by three- to four-fold,' it added.

The countries hardest hit by the epidemic are among the world's poorest, with dilapidated medical infrastructures that have all but buckled under the strain of trying to contain the virus.

Before the outbreak, Liberia for instance had one doctor to treat every 100,000 patients in a total population of some 4.4 million people.

Now that 152 healthcare workers in the country have been infected and 79 have died, the WHO said the ratio had worsened significantly.

'Every infection or death of a doctor or nurse depletes response capacity significantly,' it said.

The UN body described how taxis filled with entire families, including members suspected of having Ebola, criss-crossed Monrovia 'searching for a treatment bed'.

'There are none. As WHO staff in Liberia confirm, no free beds for Ebola treatment exist anywhere in the country.'

Liberia already accounts for about half of all cases and deaths, and 'the number of new cases is increasing exponentially,' the WHO warned 

When Ebola patients are turned away from treatment centres, 'they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes, where they inevitably infect others, perpetuating constantly higher flare-ups in the number of cases,' it said.

Taxis and motorbike taxis have become a prime source for possible Ebola transmission, since the vehicles are not disinfected between passengers, if ever, according to the WHO.

'The number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them in Ebola-specific treatment centres,' it said.

How west Africa is being affected by cases of Ebola, centring on Sierra Leone and Liberia

Fourteen of Liberia's 15 counties have now reported confirmed cases of the tropical virus, which is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids.

In Montserrado county alone, which includes Monrovia, the agency said 1,000 beds were urgently needed to treat Ebola patients.

Only 240 are currently available in that county, while 260 are being planned, said the WHO.

The agency estimates that between 200 and 250 medical staff are needed to safely manage an Ebola treatment facility with just 70 beds.

UK to set up Ebola treatment centre

British military personnel and aid experts will set up a treatment centre for the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone, the Government has announced.

The 62-bed facility will be based near the capital Freetown.

The UK's support follows a direct request from the World Health Organisation and the government of Sierra Leone for assistance in containing the outbreak.

The initial phase of the treatment centre will be up and running within eight weeks, the Department for International Development (DfID) said.

The centre will comprise a 50-bed facility for treating victims of the disease, with a 12-bed unit to provide specialist care for local and international health workers.

Military experts will begin to survey and assess the site later this week and the Government is working with Save the Children to design a long-term plan to manage and operate the facility after it has been fully set up.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'Britain is at the forefront of the global effort to tackle this deadly outbreak, having already committed £25 million of support, including frontline treatment and funding for medical research to develop a vaccine.

'The scale of the problem requires the entire international community to do more to assist the affected countries, which is why the UK is working with the government of Sierra Leone to build a new medical treatment facility near their capital Freetown.

'When it is up and running, it will enable the UK to provide medical care for local and international health workers, as well as treatment for the wider population.'

Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth said: 'Ebola threatens thousands of people's lives across West Africa and could set back development many decades.

'The key to combating this epidemic is backing front-line health workers and underpinning a fractured health system in Sierra Leone - without urgent action to assist medics, many more children and their families will suffer and die from this most appalling and tragic disease.

'Save the Children is working alongside DfID and the Ministry of Defence on a feasibility study to cement plans to firstly help set up the centre and then take it over with international experts, as well as local staff, to provide the very best life-saving health service under the most challenging conditions.'

Armed Forces Minister Mark Francois said establishing the centre would present the military with a 'unique set of challenges'.

He said: 'The people of West Africa need our help and we will not stand idly by. The UK has been at the forefront of responding to the epidemic and our military will continue the great work so far.

'This operation will involve a unique set of challenges but I believe that we have the ability to provide support to the World Health Organisation in helping to bring the outbreak under control.'

DfID was unable to provide any figures for the cost of the centre until it is established, but it will be in addition to the £25 million of aid already committed to the Ebola crisis.

The dangers faced by international humanitarian workers in countries affected by the Ebola outbreak were illustrated when British nurse William Pooley contracted the virus in Sierra Leone.
