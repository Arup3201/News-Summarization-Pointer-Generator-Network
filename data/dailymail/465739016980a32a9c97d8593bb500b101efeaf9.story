Kevin Pietersen has used the occasion of the star-studded Lord’s bicentenary match to claim he would love to play for England again, insisting ‘cricket’s never been the issue’ and pointing out that he is yet to retire from the game.

Six months after being sacked by the ECB following a breakdown in trust between him and senior figures in the England dressing-room, Pietersen will line up for Shane Warne’s Rest of the World team against an MCC side led by Sachin Tendulkar in a game to commemorate 200 years of cricket’s most famous club at Lord’s on Saturday.

As a cast list of current and recently retired cricketing stars assembled at the home of cricket on Friday, Pietersen began by posting a picture on Instagram.

Looking to the future: Kevin Pietersen still hopes to play for England again one day

Short form: Pietersen has predominantly been playing T20 cricket of late

‘My space reserved in the Lord’s 
dressing room,’ he wrote. ‘Clothes ready! So excited about tomorrow. I 
didn’t think I’d have this opportunity to play in front of a full house 
at Lord’s again. I still do hope that things change and I play for 
England here again. Time will tell...’

If
 it was possible to dismiss that as an off-the-cuff piece of 
wistfulness, then Pietersen later reiterated his desire to resume an 
international career that most observers believe came to an end 
following the Sydney Test in January.

Since
 then, Pietersen has agreed a severance package with the ECB, embarked 
on a new life as a Twenty20 freelancer, and begun a newspaper column in 
which his thoughts on Alastair Cook’s struggling side have trodden a 
fine line between constructive criticism and thinly veiled 
schadenfreude.

In another 
move unlikely to endear him to Cook, Pietersen attended the recent 
Lord’s Test against Sri Lanka alongside Piers Morgan, who has dubbed the
 England captain ‘a repulsive little weasel’.

The
 kindest interpretation is that a rapprochement could be tricky. And 
yet, with a high-profile five-Test series against India beginning on 
Wednesday, Pietersen claims he has not given up hope of mending the 
various bridges that have been burned over the last few months.

‘I’d
 love to play for England again,’ he said in the Lord’s Long Room. ‘I’ve
 still got hope.’ Asked how he thought this might come about, he 
replied: ‘I’ve got a phone in my pocket. I’ve got a pretty good resumé. 
It’s not the cricket. It’s fine.’

Did
 he really think he might add to his 104 Test caps? ‘I don’t think it 
might happen. I live in hope every day. I’m 34, I’m young. I can still 
play. I’ve got a good resumé. If things change one day, I’ll gladly 
accept the opportunity, because I love playing for England. If I didn’t 
love it, I’d have retired. But I haven’t retired.’

When
 it was put to Pietersen that the parting of the ways between him and 
England appeared to be final, he replied: ‘Not from me. I’d love to play
 again.

Short on form: Pietersen refused to be drawn on whether Alastair Cook should step down as captain

Disaster: England were beaten in every form of the game by Sri Lanka on their recent tour

‘I never lost 
interest when I played for England. Every single day I wanted to 
improve. I had ambitions, I had goals. They’re still there. I probably 
needed a couple of months out with my knee, for sure. But that seems to 
have got back working OK. It’s just a case of hoping the phone rings one
 day.’

Would he consider 
playing four-day cricket for Surrey in a bid to prove his readiness for a
 shock return to the Test team? ‘No. Cricket’s never been the issue. 
I’ve played 104 Test matches, I’ve got enough runs.’

Pietersen
 was heartened by the reception he received from fellow-diners at a 
special meal on Thursday evening at Lord’s. ‘I sat next to one of the 
MCC officials, and they said: “Wow, that was amazing.” I know the 
support has been incredible since January.’

But
 the likelihood is that the man hailed by Warne as an ‘absolute 
matchwinner, a superstar and a wonderful player’ really has represented 
England for the last time.

There
 was a moment of self-depreciation when Pietersen described himself as 
‘the genuine out-and-out clubbie, playing once a week’.

The
 sadness is this isn’t too far from the truth. Barring one of the most 
improbable U-turns in the history of cricket, Pietersen’s appearance on 
Saturday could be his last in this country outside the confines of the 
domestic game. Don’t expect him to go out with a whimper.
