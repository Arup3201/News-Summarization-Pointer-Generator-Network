South Africa is reluctant to step in as a last-minute host for next year's Africa Cup of Nations after it emerged that Morocco wants to postpone or move the tournament because of fears over the spread of the Ebola epidemic.

The South African sport ministry is also wary of the Ebola virus and cited unplanned staging costs as a reason for not wanting to host the tournament, which is scheduled to start on January 17.

'There are just too many factors to consider for South Africa,' the country's department of sport and recreation said in a statement on Friday.

The Moroccan Football Federation wrote to the Confederation of African Football (CAF)  to outline its concern that hundreds of thousands of fans travelling into the country from Ebola-affected areas could exacerbate the spread of the disease, which has killed more than 4,000 people across west Africa.

Although Morocco has not officially refused to host the finals, the country's authorities have made the case to CAF that the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone warrants either postponing the tournament or moving it to another country. It is unlikely that any of those three countries will qualify for the tournament.

In response to Morocco's concerns,  CAF have reportedly approached seven nations including Ghana and South Africa about hosting the tournament, which is scheduled to start on January 17.

The South African sports ministry stressed it had not yet been officially asked by the South African Football Association to consider hosting the tournament, but it moved quickly to rule itself out of the running. 

A statement  said the cost of an unplanned hosting in just three months was its 'major concern,' but Ebola was a factor.

'The tournament ... may also pose a challenge on how we can grapple with the Ebola challenge engulfing the continent at the moment.'

SAFA President Danny Jordaan added: 'We must all take care of this pandemic and put strict measures in place.' 

Sudan is another of the nations being touted as a possible replacement and a decision will be made when CAF's executive committee meets on November 2.

The alternative option to finding a replacement host is postponing the competition, but that would cause havoc with the football calendar, which is jam-packed as it is.

In the event of CAF forcing Morocco to host the event and the country refusing, the governing body could ban the North Africans from the organisation's competitions.

Mohamed Ouzzine, Morocco's sports minister, insisted the country's concerns were entirely sensible given the threat posed by the Ebola virus, and he stressed that his country was simply following the advice of the World Health Organisation (WHO).  

'Our concern is the health of Africa, and based on WHO reports and guidelines, we have to listen,' Ouzzine was quoted as saying in The Times.

'Zero safety does not exist, but one has to take the necessary precautions so that the coming tournament will be a football feast, bringing together our African brothers. But given the current Ebola situation, we don't think such a feast can take place as expected.

'We are talking about the Africa Cup of Nations where we are expecting between 200,000 and 400,000, even one million, spectators to converge in Morocco. I don't think there is any state or any country that has the necessary capabilities to monitor, check and control the current Ebola situation when faced with these numbers. This is our real problem. We don't have a problem with visiting teams, we have a problem with visitors.'

Precautions are also being taken in England, with Newcastle manager Alan Pardew confirming that  that they have become the first Premier League club to screen African players returning from international duty for the virus.

Pardew, when asked about Papiss Cisse, the Senegal striker, and Cheik Tiote, the Ivory Coast midfielder - who have played in Tunisia and the Democratic Republic of Congo respectively this week, as well as their own countries - stated that the Magpies would be 'naive not to have concerns' about the virus and advised other teams to take similar measures. 

'We have a strategy for when they return and making sure they and their families are taken care of,' he said. 

'They're essential to us and our doctor has looked into the problems that might arise and also protection for them, and making sure we do our very best to help them. It's something to be concerned about and we have to be on our guard.'
