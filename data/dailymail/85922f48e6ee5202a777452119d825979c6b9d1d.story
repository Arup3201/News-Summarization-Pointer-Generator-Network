Being able to understand and communicate with your pet is something that many people wish they could do.

But for the owner of a seven-year-old American pit bull terrier from Canada, the idea is less a wish and more a reality.

The  clever dog, named Czr (pronounced Caesar), is something of an internet phenomenon and has accumulated more than 32,000 likes on its Facebook page for its ability to 'speak'.

According to Czr’s Facebook page, the dog has been taught to communicate with classic learning theory

Its ability to say 'yes' and 'no' as well as nod and shake its head is what sets it apart from others like it.

And its owner has captured a typical conversation  with the dog, who stands before her  in what appears to be a hallway.

She asks her pet: ‘Do you want something?’

Immediately the dog looks at her, shakes its head and utters 'no'.

Czr the American pit bull terrier listens attentively to its owner's questions and answers accordingly

She then asks the dog whether it is bored and he again replies, but this time with a nod and the word 'yes'.

Working out that the dog wants to play, the owner rattles off a handful of options and the dog waits patiently until she guesses the right one.

After asking the Czr if he plants to play with his sister, Via (short for Octavia), he answers with a nod.

The conversation then begins to tail off with the woman asking a number of questions and the dog offering a bewildered look.

The owner asks Czr whether he would like a treat, and immediately the dog answers with a nod and convincing 'yes'.

No! Czr  shakes his head when his owner asks him whether he would like something

The video concludes with the dog 'shaking a paw' with its owner.

According to Czr’s Facebook page, he has been taught to communicate with classic learning theory.

The dog 'speaks' when he wants something and apparently he will reply to anyone.
