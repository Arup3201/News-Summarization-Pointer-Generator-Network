The men's sprint relay quartet gave the Great Britain team reason to cheer by claiming their only victory on the opening day of the European Team Championships in Braunschweig.

Adam Gemili brought the 4x100m team home for a convincing win in 38.51 seconds to leave a developmental squad in fourth place after 21 of the 40 events.

The quartet, which also featured Richard Kilty, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and James Ellington, finished 0.37secs ahead of Germany, despite keeping the changeovers safe to ensure they got the baton round.

Silver lining: Greg Rutherford was left frustrated as he could only finish second in the long jump

The win moved Britain on to 158.5 points overnight, with leaders Germany on 193.5.

Greg Rutherford, one of the most experienced members of the squad, was beaten into second in the long jump by Germany's Christian Reif, his best effort of 7.99m leaving him disappointed.

'I just couldn't get it together, it's one of those really frustrating days. Conditions were not ideal for jumping today,' the Olympic champion, who has been in fine form this season, said on BBC One.

Eilidh Child in the 400m hurdles and Danny Talbot in 100m also earned second-placed finishes.
