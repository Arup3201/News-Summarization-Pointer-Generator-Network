Miuccua Prada is being investigated over allegations her company moved assets abroad in order to avoid tax

The chairwoman of Prada is facing an investigation after it was alleged the company avoided nearly £400million in tax by transferring services abroad.

Miuccia Prada, 64, whose grandfather founded the luxury label, allegedly transferred the seat of the label to holding companies abroad, to avoid paying around £390million (€470million) to the Italian authorities.

The Milan-based company is famous for its fine leather handbags and is a favourite with celebrities such as Sienna Miller and Kate Middleton.

Company chairman Miuccia Prada, Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli and accountant Marco Salomoni have all been named in the prosecutors probe into alleged undeclared or false tax claims.

The transfer of Prada Holding, the controlling shareholder of the house, to the Netherlands and notorious tax haven Luxembourg, was purely to ensure the company a more favourable taxation, Italian Inland Revenue allege, newspaper Corriere della Sera reported.

At the end of last month, Prada agreed with the tax authorities to return its seat to Italy and pay backdated tax, claiming that it wanted ‘to invest in Italy’ to help the economic recovery.

Mr Bertelli said: ‘We are very pleased to have taken this strategic decision, consistent with our desire to invest on Italy.'

Milan prosecutors started investigating a
 few days ago when they were notified by the taxman that the 
luxury-goods company disclosed undeclared taxable income.

Lawyers for Milan-based Prada said the company wasn’t aware of a probe by Italian authorities and that documents regarding the allegations have been submitted to prosecutors.

'As it stands we are not aware of there being an investigation,' Stefano Simontacchi and Guido Alleva said in an e-mailed statement.

'In any case, the new rules which are expected to enter into force regarding voluntary disclosure should be considered applicable to the present case, thereby leading to decriminalisation,' the lawyers said.

The investigation follows efforts to clamp down on tax avoidance in Italy, after experts revealed that an estimated £90billion a year was lost in undeclared revenues. 

Last July, the two designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were sentenced to one year and eight months in prison for non-declaration of income.
