A family in Utah welcomed a baby boy into the world last month which means there are now sixth living generations within the same family.

The Rasmussen family, who live in Utah County, now range in age from one month old to 95 years old. The latest addition, baby Krew Alexander Woodland was born on August 1.

‘It was very important to me after the birth of Krew, to have a six generation picture,’ said Krew's mother Haylee Woodland told the Daily Herald. ‘I feel so very blessed to have so many grandmas still living.’

Krew’s great, great, great, grandmother Ruth Rasmussen was born in January 1918. She and her husband Niels raised three children including daughter Vivian.

Vivian Jensen Schramm was born in April 1936. After getting married she and her husband raised six children together.

‘I have wonderful memories of growing up, and I am so blessed to still have my mother, being that I am 77 years old,’ said Schramm.

Jannette Jensen Boone, one of Schramm's daughters, had four boys of her own.

‘A lot of people say, “I can’t believe you have a sixth generation, that’s pretty rare,’” great grandmother Jannette Boone told FOX 13 News. ‘That’s pretty exciting for us, because family means everything.’

Boone's oldest son, Jared, and his wife Natalie’s first child was a girl.

Haylee Ann Haveron Woodland was born in May of 1994, making her the fifth generation.

While six living generations is almost unheard of, the Guinness Book of World Records states that the most generations alive in a single family is seven.
