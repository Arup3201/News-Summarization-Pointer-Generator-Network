The most closely guarded, high-stakes secret in British retail — what on earth Marks & Spencer has come up with for its Christmas TV ad campaign — can today be revealed.

But can it top last year’s offering, which starred a dancing Seb White, the little boy with Down’s Syndrome, without being naff or cheesy? Will it shift those all-important Christmas party dresses, cashmere sweaters and mince pies? 

Has it any chance of beating the annual offering from its nemesis, John Lewis?

Oops! Falling down a rabbit hole, she loses her clothes. Luckily, Rosie is in her own label for Autograph silk and lace undies

And can it redeem the brand after the humourless ‘leading ladies’ autumn campaign, which saw the likes of artist Tracey Emin and pop starlet Ellie Goulding in the brand’s finest?

Well, I have had a sneak preview of the advert, leaked to the Daily Mail from an insider on the set, and the answer to all of these questions appears to be: Yes.

The ad will be unveiled to the Press in a gala screening tomorrow night (yes, Christmas ads are now that important), and will be screened on prime-time ITV on November 6. 

It has an all-British cast, including M&S golden girl Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and male model of the moment David Gandy, alongside Oscar-winning actress Helena Bonham Carter, in her first ever appearance for the brand.

This time, I think M&S has done its homework, and pulled off quite a coup: while Bonham Carter is known for her rather eccentric style of bird’s-nest hair and socks worn with flip-flops, of late she has become something of a fashion icon. 

Post The King’s Speech, her wonderful portrayal on TV of Liz Taylor, and an appearance on the July cover of British Vogue, she has matured into not only a red carpet ambassador for British fashion, favouring Vivienne Westwood above all others, but a curvy, creamy, increasingly classic beauty. 

Bonham Carter is certainly a vast improvement on the iconic British women chosen for the autumn campaign — a motley crew of athletes, artists, actors and authors in a shoot by legendary U.S. photographer Annie Leibovitz that was too glossy and too unattainable, with no fun or mischief at all. 

Here, Helena makes a hilarious appearance in a fairytale that, although only two minutes long, cost many millions to produce.

At the end of the ad, back in the real world, Helena reunites Rosie with her dog

The story — directed by Swedish music video maestro Johan Renck, who has made shorts for Madonna, Kylie Minogue and Robbie Williams — has a cinematic soundtrack.

The narrative is as follows: Rosie, gorgeous pillow-lipped creature that she is, clad in checked sweater, cream coat and black skinny jeans, emerges from her house in a very Victorian, deserted London with her West Highland terrier (Oh my God, he’s gorgeous! So much so that the store will be selling stuffed toys which look like the actor dog, Ralph).

The dog then runs away, and disappears down a rabbit hole. Rosie sets off in hot pursuit (who knew she could squeeze down a tiny hole with those extravagant breasts?). And, losing her clothes on the way to reveal her underwear (boys: there are two shots of Rosie wearing very little indeed — she has never looked more beautiful), she enters a magical world of Alice In Wonderland, where the tea party is hosted by male model Gandy, clad in immaculate British-manufactured menswear.

Rosie magically transforms into Red Riding Hood (sporting a gorgeous Autograph red coat), then is transported on a magic carpet straight out of the Arabian Knights, and becomes Dorothy, all pigtails and cream cocktail dress, to enter the land of The Wizard Of Oz.

Which is where a giant Bonham Carter 
comes in, as the wizard, which suits her down to the ground. ‘Love those
red shoes!’ she booms, in that famous, cut-glass voice.

Finally, Rosie (who knew she could act!) re-emerges into the real world to find that Helena, immaculate in a faux fur-trimmed black coat, has not only rescued her dog (Phew! Remember, an abused dog, shivering outside in a snow-covered kennel, didn’t work terribly well for John Lewis), but admires Rosie’s outfit as well. 

The product placement — dresses, dresses and more dresses — is perfect, and there is nothing cheesy about the production, apart from the Cheddar truckles at the tea party. It’s fun, and, given the chemistry between Rosie and Gandy, super sexy. 

Rosie is a reliable cash cow (excuse the term) for Marks, with her own-label lingerie selling more than any other brand in the store’s history. And the chiselled features of David Gandy will keep mums, who will be the ones lugging those Magic and Sparkle carrier bags home, very happy indeed.

Regal: Helena Bonham Carter, who won an Oscar for her performance in The King's Speech, is a classy, unexpected ingredient in the advert, writes Liz Jones

And Helena Bonham Carter? Teamed cleverly with Rosie, she’s a classy, unexpected ingredient in a perfect mix that will appeal to Everywoman, being neither too frumpy, nor too unattainable. 

She’s a busy, likeable North London mum in her late 40s who hasn’t decamped to Beverly Hills or opted for cosmetic surgery, and proves that, with M&S’s help, she scrubs up extremely well, giving us ordinary mortals big buckets of hope. 

The bigwigs at Marks’ HQ in Paddington — CEO Marc Bolland, head of fashion Belinda Earl et al — are trembling in their shoes, anxious not only about how the ad will play to the Press on Tuesday night, but also what on earth John Lewis has up its merino wool sleeve. 

From my sneak preview, the ad is a triumph. But will other viewers agree?

For M&S’s vocal shareholders, this cannot just be a vanity project, an escape for a few moments into fantasy. It has to make those cash registers burst into song.
