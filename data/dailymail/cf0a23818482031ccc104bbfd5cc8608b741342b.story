Two AK-47 magazines were allowed through security by the TSA, tucked into a checked bag of a Yemeni national traveling on a one-way ticket home along with thousands of dollars, it was revealed today.

Bassam Alkhanshli, 32, was found in possession of the empty clips as he prepared to travel to Yemen on a one-way ticket from JFK along with 28-year-old Methaq Mohammed Ali.

A TSA spokesman told MailOnline today that the empty magazines were in checked luggage and although the clips are illegal, the agency's role is not to find such items. The TSA is focused on finding any item which would cause 'catastrophic damage' to a plane.

Bassam Alkhanshli allegedly had two empty AK-47 assault-rifle magazines stowed in his luggage as he traveled from JFK to his native Yemen on a one-way ticket

The men were initially stopped by the TSA
 because they were flying one-way to Yemen on Sunday at 11pm - alerting 
counter-terrorism officials.

Alkhanshli was carrying $12,000 and Ali had $14,000 - above the $10,000 limit for cash being taken out of the U.S.

The men were then questioned by U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel leading to them missing the flight. After explaining the money, they were cleared to take another flight.

Before departure, ten pieces of their luggage was re-examined by customs officers.

Despite the luggage having been screened and cleared by the TSA, Customers Officer Richard Sanicola later found two 30-round AK-47 magazine clips in Alkhanshli’s bag. No ammunition was found.

'I did not know I was not supposed to have this,' Alkhanshli said, according to the New York Post. 

Alkhanshli, who lives in Tennessee and has a pistol permit, has been a naturalized U.S. citizen since 2009.

Alkhanshli was arraigned in Queens Criminal Court after being charged with criminal possession of a weapon. Bail was set at $5,000 bond or $2,500 cash.

In a statement today, the TSA said: 'TSA’s screening procedures, which are governed by federal law, are focused on security and are designed to detect potential threats to aviation and passengers.

'The TSA does not require empty magazine clips to be declared to the airline, and TSA is not actively searching for empty magazine clips in checked luggage.

'Our focus is on finding high threat items such as explosives and/or improvised explosive device (IED) components that could cause catastrophic damage to an aircraft.'
