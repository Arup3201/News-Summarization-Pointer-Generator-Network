Four men were miraculously found alive after a landslide buried them alive on a construction site in China

Two of the builders had been buried in the trench for over two hours when firefighters pulled them out on Wednesday afternoon.

The accident happened in Shaoyang County, southern China's Hunan province when two builders working on the site were buried in a mudslide.

Stuck in: Firefighters tread carefully as they free one of the men so as not to set off another landslide

When the construction team sent two workers to rescue them, they too were caught in a second slide.

Firefighters were called to the scene and after two hours, all four workers were found unharmed.

This is the latest in a long line of work related accidents in China as a result of its notoriously slack health and safety regulations, some of which have had deadly outcomes.

In September, 19 workers died on a construction site in Wuhan, central China when a lift cable snapped, causing it to fall 30 floors.

Bad luck twice: The first two men were buried whilst working in this trench in Shaoyang county, Hunan, and the last two were caught in a landslide trying to save them

Dig him out: Firefighters and builders uncover the head of one of the men, miraculously still alive

The accident occurred only days after a 
man nearly died from a metal bar impaling his head on another 
construction site in Shangrao, China's eastern Jiangxi province.

A prominent case is that of Iphone and iPad supplier Foxconn, which put
 up metal wires on their factories' dormitory windows after 14 
workers jumped to their deaths at their 
Shenzhen plant in 2010.

Despite the safety measures a further five workers have killed themselves in 2011-2012 at different Foxconn factories across China.

Although the government says it is taking measures to reduce fatalities,
 more than 75,500 people died in work-related accidents last year, 
according to the State Administration of Work Safety.

Blessed: The builders were lucky to be alive after two hours under the rubble and mud

Relief: Shaken and very dirty, the construction worker is finally freed from the mud
