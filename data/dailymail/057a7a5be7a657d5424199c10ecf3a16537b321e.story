The United States may still be on high alert for Ebola - but that didn't stop Saturday Night Live turning its comedic talents to mocking efforts to control the spread of the disease.

The show made light of the fiasco over whether to quarantine Kaci Hickox - which ended up in an imagined fistfight between her and Chris Christie, the New Jersey Governor who implemented the harsh new rules.

The opening skit on the NBC show began with 'Governor Christie', played by Bobby Moynihan, trying to explain his compulsory quarantine rules, which were briefly applied to any health workers returning from West Africa.

Ebola fist-fight: In the sketch, SNL imagined Chris Christie going toe-to-toe with quarantine-defying nurse Kaci Hickox

When asked whether the measures were 'inhumane', Moynihan didn't mince his words.

He responded: 'With all due respect, you need to shut the hell up. She got a tent in a parking lot with her own porta-potty – in New Jersey that’s a luxury condo.' 

Confronted with claims he had backed down after the CDC and President Obama turned on him, he pugnacious Governor-figure went on: 'That’s a bunch of malarky – our policy has not changed: if you present symptoms you will be quarantined.

Ebola? Just kidding! Kate KcKinnon, playing Hickox, coughed before talking about how she had been handing out candy and visited a 'kissing booth' - referring to possible methods of spreading the disease

'But if I then get a call from President Barack Obama...', he continued, before a meandering anecdote of when he met the President during Hurricane Sandy.

The scene later  returned to Ebola, cutting to 'Hickox' - played by Kate McKinnon, at her home in Maine.

Explaining her defiance of voluntary quarantines, she introduced herself as: 'Kaci with an I as in "I don’t care if I have Ebola I’m riding my damn bike!"

Consistent until its not: Christie, played by Bobby Moynihan, admitted he caved to demands from Obama

'I’ve been doing whatever I feel like, took a dip in a public pool, volunteered at a kissing booth. For Halloween I handed out about 1000 loose M&Ms with my bare hands.'

When asked whether her actions were 'cavalier', she plowed on: 'Many people are intimidated by a smart, strong women who has lost her mind!

'I stood up to Ebola, I’m not going to be scared off by a governor who looks like a cartoon on a pizza box.'

At the mention of his name, Moynihan's Christie appeared miraculously. When asked how he got from New York to Maine in seconds, he brushed of the inconsistency, saying: 'I’m Chris Christie, I’m everywhere!'

A brief war of words then devolved into a fistfight between the political heavyweight and incorrigible nurse.
