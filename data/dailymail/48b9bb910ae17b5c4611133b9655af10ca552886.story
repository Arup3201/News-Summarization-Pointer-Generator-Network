It has been nicknamed the 'Costa del Crime' because of the large number of expat British criminals who are thought to live there.

And now the Costa del Sol, in southern Spain, is home to a new fugitive from the law after a large reptile - believed to be a crocodile - was spotted hiding out in the area.

The seven-foot-long creature, dubbed the 'Costa Croc' is thought to be living by a lake near Marbella, just a stone's throw away from holiday homes owned by British residents.

Grave danger: Spanish police have put up signs around the lake in Mijas - warning tourists to beware of a crocodile on the loose in the area

Local authorities in the popular 
holiday resort of Mijas have put up red warning signs in 
Spanish saying: 'Grave Danger. Crocodile On The Loose.'

Police are taking it in turns to 
watch out for the bird-eating reptile, thought to have been abandoned by a
 local who had been keeping it as an exotic pet. The area where it has been spotted, a
 favourite walking and jogging spot next to a golf club used by hundreds
 of British people, is fast becoming a tourist attraction.

Dozens of expats and holidaymakers 
are ignoring police warnings to walk to the lakes every day in the hope 
of spotting the alligator.

Despite putting up danger signs, 
local authorities say they do not expect to catch the reptile until 
temperatures rise and it has to start looking for food. Experts have calculated the creature is nearly 
seven foot long and aged between 12 and 18 from footprints found by the 
lake.

They believe it is most likely an 
alligator, which has a wider upper jaw than the typical crocodile. 
British expat Ross Bell, restaurant manager at El Soto Golf Club next to
 the 
lake, said: 'The police have already been to see us and warned us a 
crocodile is on the loose.

'We thought they were joking at first but now the signs have gone up, we can see they're taking it seriously.

'We're still intending [to go] down 
there after work most nights to see if we can spot it. I've been told 
they can run fast but I'll make sure I run faster if I come across it. I
 suspect it will turn out to be a caiman.'

Richard Seamark, who manages the golf
 shop, added: 'Most of our British clients think it's a bit of a joke 
really. After all the hoo-hah with horse meat, we're thinking of 
offering croc-burgers if we catch it.

'We've had problems in the past with 
wild boar and put up fencing round the golf course five years ago 
because they were coming in and digging up the greens looking for food. 
We never thought though they might be a good crocodile deterrent.'

The lake the crocodile was spotted by is 
one of three man-made lakes overlooked by hundreds of apartments whose 
owners are 80 per cent British. The area was badly damaged by 
wildfires over the last two summers.

Mijas 
town hall spokesman Mario Bravo said: 'We don't believe the reptile will
 be a danger to human beings unless it feels intimidated or threatened. The main danger would be if someone 
accidentally trod on it in the undergrowth or tried to capture it 
because they want to take it home or gain fame as the person who caught 
it.

'Police are patrolling the area on 
motorbikes every day in the hope of spotting it but we know it's an 
animal that isn't that active in winter and won't start showing itself 
much until the weather gets warmer.'
