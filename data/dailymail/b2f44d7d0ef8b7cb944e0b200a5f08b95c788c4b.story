The parents of murdered schoolboy Daniel Morcombe say they are in a good place just a few months after Brett Peter Cowan was jailed for life for killing their son.

Bruce and Denise Morcombe spent 10 years not knowing what happened to 13-year-old Daniel after he went missing from a Queensland bus stop in December 2003.

They have now written a book about the turmoil and distress they faced during the search for their son and how the case almost tore their family apart.

Bruce and Denise Morcombe say they are in a good place just a few months after Brett Peter Cowan was jailed for life for killing their son

Cowan was sentenced to life behind bars in March and the Morcombes say their family has been able to move on quickly in the months after.

'You would think there would be the lingering anxiety and difficult dark times but, truly, from that afternoon we just walked away and felt so much stronger and in a better space,' Mr Morcombe told A Current Affair.

The reality of their loss resurfaced last month when a photo was released of Cowan looking healthy at his maximum security prison - but the couple found comfort in knowing Cowan was not a well-liked face behind bars.

'We felt quite uncomfortable looking at that photo. It looked like he'd been in quite a good paddock. He wasn't the gaunt, drug affected person that we were used to seeing,' Mr Morcombe said.

'I believe he goes to the doctors twice a week and he has two security guards with him because the other prisoners just don’t want to see him or they don’t want him near them at all,' Mrs Morcombe added.

The couple have detailed in the book the extreme lengths they went to in a bid to find Daniel when he went missing, including physically digging for his remains.

Denise has admitted the couple probably went a bit made during the search for Daniel

'Denise and I were literally on our hands and knees because we had a map where Daniel’s remains were supposed to have been located. We didn’t have any tools with us and we were there with a stick trying to unearth his potential remains,' Mr Morcombe said.

'We were meeting people fresh out of jail that were happy to assist us in finding Daniel.'

'We probably were going a bit mad at the time but what do you do when someone tells you they’ve got some information – all we wanted to do was find Daniel,' Mrs Morcombe said.

The Morcombes, who celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary last month, said their marriage was still strong despite the lengths they have been.

'I don’t know how we did what we did in the last 10 years,' Mrs Morcombe said. 

The couple continue to travel the country to raise awareness about Daniel's case in a bid to keep children safe. 

Where is Daniel? The Family's Story by Bruce and Denise Morcombe will be released on Tuesday, August 5.
