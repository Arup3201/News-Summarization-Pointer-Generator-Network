When Vincent Kompany speaks he tends to make sense. So when, after Manchester City’s trouncing of hapless Newcastle, the Belgian claimed Stoke could be tougher opponents than Champions League visitors Barcelona, heads turned.

Did he really just say that? He did — and Manuel Pellegrini’s leader had a point.

‘Barcelona’s ability is not about hurting you all game,’ Kompany explained. ‘You can have tougher games when you go to Stoke. It’s about the fact Barcelona can decide a game within a second.

‘They have more players than anyone else in the world who can finish games with a touch of magic.’

Kompany knows all about those game-finishing moments. Last season he was at fault, stepping up for an offside that was never there when Lionel Messi was set clear at the Etihad with the tie at 0-0.

Kompany’s defensive partner, Martin Demichelis, had little option but to bring down Messi in the area. From relative comfort, City found themselves a goal down and a man short, all because of a tiny lapse in concentration.

They would go on to lose the tie 4-1 on aggregate. On the evidence of Saturday evening’s procession, however, Pellegrini’s men would appear to be better equipped a year on for the home leg.

Yes, they will miss the suspended Yaya Toure in the first game but, with an hour gone and his rampant side already 5-0 up against a Newcastle outfit collapsing quicker than England’s cricketers against New Zealand, Pellegrini declared and took off two-goal magician David Silva and the revitalised Sergio Aguero.

Both can provide for City those moments of brilliance Kompany referred to. Aguero, who missed the first leg last year and retired at half-time in the second, will be relishing the opportunity.

As is Kompany, who added that City are not scared of their now familiar foes.

‘Fear?’ he said. ‘We don’t fear them. You don’t go in at this level fearing strikers. We want to play against them. It’s the fourth time in a year now. There’s nothing new to worry us, it’s a case of having the whole team at a very high level.’

A cool penalty from Aguero, a thumping close-range shot from Samir Nasri and a sublime finish from the reborn Edin Dzeko put City 3-0 up after just 21 minutes.

A quickfire double from Silva following the break had Newcastle fans streaming for the bars.

Before five-star City narrowed the gap on Chelsea to five points, Barcelona had suffered a surprise 1-0 home defeat at the hands of Pellegrini’s former club Malaga.

The Chilean, who introduced £28million man Wilfried Bony for a half-hour cameo, cancelled a planned briefing with the Spanish press last week for fear it would distract from the visit of John Carver’s generous Geordies. But did Barca take their eye off the ball?

‘Maybe they were thinking about Tuesday,’ said Pellegrini.

When the Catalans came calling last year, City remained in the Capital One Cup and the FA Cup. This time there are no such diversions and Pellegrini reluctantly admitted this put them in better shape.

‘We’d played 18 games in December and January and were really tired by the time we met Barcelona. This time we are arriving at the game not having so many games as last season and that could be important.I would always prefer to stay in the cup competitions but when you are out of them it is easier to focus.’

Pellegrini agreed that Aguero, out for five weeks following a knee injury in December, was nearing top form again. ‘Every game he is improving and he is now arriving again to the high-performance level he had before his injury,’ he said.

Carver, left to rue a display that started badly and got worse, does not believe the defeat will harm his chances of landing the Newcastle job permanently. ‘It’s not going to be the end of the world,’ he said. ‘We’ll be judged on the games against Villa and teams like that.’

For City, whose owners demand European progression, judgment is looming.
