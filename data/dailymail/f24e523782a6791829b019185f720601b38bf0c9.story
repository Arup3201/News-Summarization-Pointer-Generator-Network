A Dutch TV presenter stunned viewers after drinking milk direct from a mother's breasts during his primetime Saturday night show.

Host Paul de Leeuw had invited a group of women from a charity which allows the exchange of breast milk between mothers to his entertainment show, Langs de Leeuw.

During an interview with the women, the host asked whether breast milk was 'nice and sweet' and asked if he could taste some.Â

One of the women offered him a bottle of the milk but de Leeuw said he would prefer to drink from the source.

'Well, if you don't bite you may try it,' the volunteer, named Wendy, said.

De Leeuw leaned in and drunk from one of her breasts before pulling back and starting on the second breast.

'I find the second one better tasting, but I can taste that you've eaten asparagus yesterday,' de Leeuw quipped.

The segment has generated criticism on social media but volunteer Wendy defended the unusual exchange, saying it was 'for a good cause'.
