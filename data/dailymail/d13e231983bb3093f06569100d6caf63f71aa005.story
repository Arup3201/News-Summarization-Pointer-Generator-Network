The Prime Minister is known to be a fan of technology ever since it emerged that he's addicted to playing Fruit Ninja on his iPad.

But today David Cameron truly cemented his reputation as a man of the modern world by announcing his cabinet reshuffle on Twitter - in 140 characters or less.

In a series of micro messages from behind the door of Number 10 David Cameron told his 2million followers exactly who he'd decided to hire and fire, signing off with the hashtag #reshuffle.

Announcements: In a series of micro messages from 
behind the door of Number 10 David Cameron told his 2million Twitter followers 
exactly who he has decided to hire and fire - and more messages look set to follow

The tweeting appeared to have been triggered by Baroness Warsi who used her official @ToryChairman Twitter 
account at 2am to steal Mr Cameron's thunder and confirm she was 'signing off', saying it had 
been 'a privilege and an honour to serve my party as co-chairman'.

But at 10am the PM 
proved he too is a social media fan by tweeting more than 14 times about various 
new appointments from his @number10gov account, including the sensational appointment of Culture 
Secretary Jeremy Hunt as Secretary of State for Health.

He
 replaces Andrew Lansley who has been spectacularly sacked because of 
his failure to push through NHS reforms and made Leader of the House of 
Commons instead.

Time to move on: David Cameron, pictured leading his first cabinet 
meeting at number 10 in May 2010, is today announcing his first full 
reshuffle since then - and he's using Twitter to help him

It's the first time a prime minister 
has used Twitter to announce a cabinet reshuffle and shows just how 
significant social media has become - even within the government.

Normally cabinet reshuffle details 
come via more formal statements released to the media or 
via announcements in the House of Commons.

This morning, Lady's Warsi's online announcement prompted outgoing Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan to also announce her own job loss on Twitter.

Night owl: Lady Warsi tweeted to admit that she was no longer co-chairman of the Conservative party

Following suit: Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan then replied to Sayeeda Warsi saying that she had also been given the chop - complete with smiley emoticon

Replying
 to Lady Warsi's tweet she said: 'signing off @Welsh_Secretary too but I
 agree great privilege to serve in cabinet but can serve party from back
 benches too.'

Later Mr 
Cameron tweeted that Justice Minister Kenneth Clarke had been 
appointed Minister without Portfolio - a demotion from his Justice 
Secretary role which has been given to Chris Grayling - also announced 
on the micro-blogging site.

Further announcements including the 
demotion of Justine Greening, who was stripped of her role as Transport 
Minister and handed the Secretary of State for International Development
 job, with Patrick McLoughlin stepping into her former role. 

#reshuffle: Normally information about cabinet reshuffles comes via more formal statements released the media or announcements in the House of Commons - but the PM is embracing social media 

Meanwhile Maria Miller was named Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and Minister for Women and Equalities.

It's not clear if it is Mr Cameron 
himself posting the messages - it's more likely to be one of his aides familiar with the ins and outs of Twitter.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 
'Twitter is only one of the channels that No10 uses to communicate to 
large audiences, it hasn't replaced other means.'

Balancing act: Several senior cabinet members, including Ken Clarke, lost their current jobs today
