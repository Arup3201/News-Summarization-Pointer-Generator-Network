Sitting in the casualty department of one of the best-known hospitals in Britain, I can’t help but notice it’s packed to the rafters.

Yet it’s not a hectic Saturday night, but a Monday lunchtime at the beginning of December and everyone seems sober.

Despite this, I struggle to find a seat, even though it is obvious I’m in deep shock and on the point of passing out in agony. This is by far the worst pain I’ve ever suffered.

I know my upper arm is broken — I fell off a step and heard the crack — and fully expect at least a four-hour wait.

A woman having a cigarette outside warned me as I arrived: ‘Hope you’ve set aside the whole day. I’ve been waiting ages!’

As I look around the crowd, I see little evidence of painful injury. I ask the woman next to me what she’s come for — a headache, no less. ‘No point calling the GP. You can never get seen,’ she says.

It’s the same story with the worried-looking father a few rows back. With a feverish young son lying listlessly on his lap, he explains he came straight to the hospital. He didn’t even think to start with his GP.

It’s clear evidence that casualty is becoming the first port of call whether it’s an accident, emergency or just feeling a bit poorly. No wonder the staff at the Royal Free Hospital in North London look so strained.

My worries about a long wait are mercifully unfounded — obviously, a genuine crisis is attended to as a priority. Within 20 minutes I see a triage nurse and am sent for an X-ray. A broken humerus is confirmed and I’m sent home wearing a sling with the hope the break is clean and will begin to mend. I’m to see the consultant the following week in the fracture clinic.

So far, for a badly injured woman in her 60s, so good. It’s been a long time since I was an emergency case.

It was the early Nineties. I’d slipped down a set of stairs and not so much broke, as demolished, my ankle. I recall a quick consultation, instant admission, pins and screws and a two-week stay with good care.

But, as I was to discover, it’s a very different story now. I’ve always been a staunch supporter of the NHS, a service that was introduced just two years before my birth in 1950, and made all the difference in the world to my parents’ peace of mind.

For the first time in their lives, they didn’t have to worry about paying for the inoculations — polio, diphtheria and smallpox — that were now available to every child, free of charge.

It never occurred to me to consider private medicine as I got older. I had my two sons on the NHS and received kind, attentive and sympathetic care before, during and after birth.

When I was diagnosed with breast cancer nearly ten years ago, I was given a speedy referral by an excellent GP and instant admission for a mastectomy into The Christie Hospital in Manchester. The surgical care was first rate and there was never a shortage of nurses to attend to me.

I’ve defended the NHS to any critic. Free health care at the point of need seems to me the very essence of a caring community. ‘So what,’ I’ve said testily to people complaining about the wait in a clinic for a post-operative cancer check-up. ‘You’re getting top-class treatment for free! What have you got to whinge about?’

But now I’m worried that this precious service is in danger of imploding.

Admittedly, my casualty experience at the Royal Free was faultless and, a week later, when I attend the fracture clinic, I have nothing to complain about. The wait was no more than half an hour, the X-ray pretty quick. The consultant recommended surgery.

I was to be admitted on the Wednesday evening and was told to get my necessary blood tests done in advance. And that’s when the trouble started. The blood test queue filled a large waiting room and stretched, snake-like, along the corridor.

My number was 365 — and 210 had just been called. It was two-and-a half hours before they got to me. Just as well I’d set the whole day aside.

Wednesday came and I still had no information about when and where, or indeed if, I should turn up that evening.

I called admissions. They hadn’t a clue. I emailed the surgeon’s secretary, and at 5pm I finally had a call. I was to arrive at the orthopaedic ward around 7.30pm. They’d finally found me a bed.

The nurses could not have been more welcoming or attentive, but I soon learned that the chief nurse in the department had been on duty since 8am. It was now going on for 8.30pm, and when the consultant popped by, he casually suggested she might consider going home at some point.

Jenni was diagnosed with a broken humerus, she has long been a supporter of the NHS especially after the care she received when she was suffering from breast cancer nearly ten years ago

I think the poor thing finally left around 10pm. I got the impression 14-hour shifts were far from unusual.

The staff nurse who came to check me before lights out looked equally exhausted. He was Portuguese and told me he’d be the only qualified nurse on duty overnight, with the support of three or four health care assistants, in charge of 16 patients.

Most of Thursday was a blur. Anaesthetic, surgery, recovery and then a room on the cardiac ward to monitor me overnight because no beds were available in orthopaedics.

After a blissful night on morphine, I was moved to the general ward, still in the cardiac department, to be tended by a group of half a dozen nurses and health care assistants.

They were rushed off their feet, making sure everyone — four in my room and a number of other bays — was washed, fed, watered and taken to the toilet. No patient was left wanting, but the staff looked as if they should be the ones in bed.

And then there was Alice. She was in the next bed. She was in her late 70s, had suffered a heart attack and was obviously not in full control of her mental faculties. She shouted constant abuse at the nurses who tried their best for her.

She was especially troublesome at night, so I and the other two women — a hotel proprietor from Blackpool with a rare heart condition and a quiet elderly woman — didn’t get much sleep.

Alice’s finest hour came around 3am on my fifth and final night. She shouted more abuse at the nurses, insisting on getting out of bed.

I got up and walked to the corridor for a break and a cup of hot chocolate, when a mug flew past my ears and smashed against the wall. More were thrown around the ward: Alice had been saving them up, hiding them who knows where, for a major assault.

Three huge security men didn’t know what to do as she rampaged. I suggested to a distraught young nurse to call psychiatry.

A doctor arrived after about half an hour — it’s a huge hospital — as we all looked on in horror at the sight of Alice losing it.

She was given a drastic chemical cosh and it worked. I’m sure the young nurses are used to dealing with crises, but even they seemed shocked and at a loss to know how to deal with such violence.

Next morning, when I woke and made my way to the loo, the Blackpool woman warned me: ‘Don’t go in there!’ At some point in the night, Alice had managed a dirty protest in the bathroom.

She should never have been in a room with other patients. I don’t know why she wasn’t in a room of her own. Shortage of beds and staff again, I guess.

When I left, I was discharged by a junior doctor who did not give me any paperwork to tell me what would happen next. I had to ping off another email to the consultant’s secretary again to find out.

I needed the GP to trim stitches and should have physiotherapy after four weeks, she said. I wonder how many patients leave in ignorance because they don’t know who or how to ask?

I will continue to support the principle of the NHS. I certainly won’t be arguing in favour of paying £5 to been seen in casualty, as some have suggested. Free at the point of need is what we are so proud to maintain.

But investment in staff is unquestionably a priority. These nurses are desperate to do a good job, but there are too few of them to service the need.

I would plead with anyone who feels ill to make their first port of call their GP so that emergency departments can do the job they’re set up to do; deal with emergencies. As for the shortage of beds, we must have effective social and convalescent care to end bed-blocking.

And those overworked nurses? Let’s stop picking holes in this magnificent service we are privileged to have at our disposal, and say a collective thank you to those working so hard.

Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely hope I don’t see any one of you again, for a long, long time, but you have my gratitude and admiration. I hope it sustains you through tonight’s 14-hour shift.

Alice’s name has been changed.

However her recent trip to casualty showed her a different side to the story
