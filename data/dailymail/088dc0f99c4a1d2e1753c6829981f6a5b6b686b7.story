Allegations of child sexual abuse have arisen at another one of Australia's most prestigious private schools, prompting a new investigation.

St Ignatius College Riverview issued letters to its alumni informing them a claim relating to child sexual abuse had been made and informing them the information had been passed on to NSW police for investigation,  the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The letter, penned by Principal Paul Hine, gave no details of the allegations except that it concerned child sexual abuse and that it happened more than 30 years ago.

The allegation was passed to Dr Hine by the professional standards office of the Australian Province of the Society of Jesus.

Michelle O’Brien, the director of professional standards for the Jesuits, told The Australian her office had been aware of the claims for more than a year and that they had been passed on to police last May.

Mr Hine was briefed on the claim four weeks ago.

Due to the sensitive nature of the allegation very little information has be released, however, Dr Hine insisted it was his duty to inform past and present students of the harrowing claim.

The principal called on students, past and present, to report any concerns they have relating to child abuse to himself or the Australian Province of the Society of Jesus immediately.

In an excerpt of the letter published by the Sydney Morning Herald, Dr Hine wrote: ‘I believe it important to inform you about the situation as I understand it and to offer reassurance that such matters are the object of direct and sustained vigilance at the school.’

Dr Hine has been principal of St Ignatius since 2013

The principal called on students, past and present, to report any concerns they have relating to child abuse to himself or the Australian Province of the Society of Jesus immediately.

‘The college and the Jesuits wish to express, in the strongest possible terms, their abhorrence of sexual misconduct or any form of abuse involving children,’ the letter read.

‘We wish to respond to past abuse and suffering with a commitment to healing, openness and accountability.’

Dr Pine tried to remind students and parents that Riverview has a ‘proud history’ of caring for its students.

"This situation presents a salient reminder of the need to protect our young people both in policy and in practice."

The prestigious school, located on Sydney’s north shore, has been responsible for the education of several high profile Australians including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Minister for Agriculture Barnaby Joyce and the Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher.

 The recent claims dredged up old allegations that former teacher and pupil Peter Bohrsmann had sexually abused a student during his time at Riverview.

The 57-year-old categorically denied the allegations made to police anonymously before taking his own life two days later on school grounds.

Police have made no links between the current allegations and any past complaints.
