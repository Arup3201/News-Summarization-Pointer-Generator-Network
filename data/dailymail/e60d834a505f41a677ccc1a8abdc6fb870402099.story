An irate stripper went ballistic on a fellow employee at a gentlemen's club and attacked her with a clear plastic high-heeled shoe leaving the victim with huge puncture wounds on her scalp.

Carolyn Wright, 22, allegedly grabbed Ashley Michaels-Hoder, 24, by the hair and began hitting her with the deadly spiked shoe at club 'Chez Joey' in Myrtle Beach.

The brutal beating   took place in the bathroom of the South Carolina club on Wednesday at 2 am, according to a police report obtained by The Smoking Gun.

Victim: Ashley Michaels-Hoder, also referred to as 'Bianca the bartender' on the club's Facebook page, suffered a swollen left eye, and swelling to her forehead

Michaels-Hoder, a bartender at the strip joint, said that she was unable to defend herself since Wright was holding her head down.

But when she managed to lift her head, ‘the offender struck her multiple times in the face with the same shoe,’ police reported. 

The victim was interviewed while being treated in hospital. She suffered a swollen left eye, swelling to her forehead, and two puncture wounds that a doctor said would require staples.

Wright has not yet been arrested in connection with the incident, which police have classified as an aggravated felony.

But she has a history of violence and served two short jail sentences this year after being arrested twice for disorderly conduct and assault crimes.
