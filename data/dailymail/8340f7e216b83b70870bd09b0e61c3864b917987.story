The wife of a prominent Indian 
politician died from stress and the wrong medication â€” not suicide, her 
son has said in media reports.

The death of Sunanda Pushkar has gotten 
front-page coverage since she was found dead in a luxury New Delhi hotel last week, a 
couple of days after she apparently tweeted that her husband, Shashi 
Tharoor, a top government official, was having an affair with a 
Pakistani journalist.

Following her funeral yesterday, her son, Shiv Menon, has been reported as saying Pushkar was too strong to commit suicide, which many Indian news services had speculated since the news was broken.

Menon said: 'It was an unfortunate combination of 
media stress, tensions and a wrong mix of different medications,'

'Tharoor would never have harmed my mother. They were very much in love, despite occasional differences, which they always overcame.'

The
 Indian media, quoting investigators, reported last week that Pushkar died of 
an overdose of prescription medications, and police are still investigating
 whether the death was deliberate or accidental.

Mr Tharoor's personal assistant Abhinav Kumar had previously told reporters there were no signs of foul play.

He said: 'She was lying in bed. There were no signs of any foul play or any struggle. She had no sign of poisoning or anything'.

Mrs Pushkar Tharoor appeared to detail an affair, but a statement later said the tweets were unauthorised and her marriage was a happy one

However, doctors have said the minister's wife suffered 'certain injuries' and an 'unnatural death'.

Sudhir Gupta, head of forensics at the All India Institute of Medical 
Sciences, spoke after medics carried out an initial autopsy on her body.

'It is a case of unnatural, sudden death,' he said. 'We will conclude our report and opinion within a couple of days.

'Since the investigating agency is now working on the case there are certain issues relating to the injuries that cannot be revealed now. But there were certain injuries on the body'.

However, it is unclear who or what could have inflicted the injuries referred to, or whether they are believed to be the cause of death.

A news agency, Press Trust of India, reported that Mrs Pushkar Tharoor was believed to have taken her own life.

One doctor involved with the post mortem, Dr Adarsh Kumar, told the Daily Mail's Indian edition Mail Today: 'The injuries didn't contribute to her death. We suspect that she might have died due to a drug overdose.'

She also had underlying illnesses, it was reported.

Last week, messages on Twitter said Mrs Pushkar Tharoor would expose a 'rip-roaring affair' between her husband and the Pakistan-based journalist Mehr Tarar.

She reportedly hacked into her husband's Twitter account to publish private messages between the pair to his two million followers.

One of the messages, allegedly sent from Ms Tarar's account, was reported to have said: 'I love you, Shashi Tharoor. And I go while in love with you, irrevocably, irreversibly, hamesha [always]. Bleeding, but always your Mehr.'

The tweets were deleted and Mr Tharoor, 57, said his account had been hacked.

Journalist Ms Tarar also denied claims that she had any involvement with the minister.

Then last Thursday, a day before her death, Mr Tharoor and his wife released a joint statement on Facebook saying they were still happily married and intended to stay together.

Shashi Tharoor was left red-faced after messages appeared on his Twitter feed suggesting he was having an affair with Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarar, who has denied any affair. The messages were quickly deleted

'We are distressed by the unseemly 
controversy that has arisen about some unauthorised tweets from our 
Twitter accounts,' the statement said.

'Various distorted accounts of comments allegedly made by Sunanda have appeared in the press.

'It
 appears that some personal and private comments responding to these 
unauthorised tweets -- comments that were not intended for publication 
-- have been misrepresented and led to some erroneous conclusions.

'We
 wish to stress that we are happily married and intend to remain that 
way. Sunanda has been ill and hospitalised this week and is seeking to 
rest. We would be grateful if the media respects our privacy.'

Police have launched an inquest into Mrs Pushkar Tharoor's death and were questioning her husband about the circumstances of her discovery.

As the story unfolded, Sunada Pushkar, Shashi Tharoor and Mehr Tarar all took to Twitter

Tharoor's aides said the couple had checked into the luxury hotel this week because of renovation work at his Delhi bungalow.

He left the hotel room to attend a session of the Congress 
party in the capital but returned in the evening to find the door 
locked, they said.

The body of his wife of four years was found after the door was forced open.

He complained of chest 
pains in the early hours the day after she was found and was treated in hospital.

Former
 UN diplomat and author Tharoor, who had more than two million Twitter 
followers, married Sunanda in 2010, in a third marriage for both.

Earlier
 that year he had been forced to resign from his first ministerial job 
after accusations which linked him to a company bidding for a cricket team in
 the lucrative Indian Premier League.

Sunanda had a stake in the company at the time.

The
 scandal could hardly come at a worse time for India's ruling Congress 
party. It is trying to shake allegations of corruption as it prepares to
 face the main opposition Hindu nationalist party in an election before 
May.

Television images 
showed Sunanda's young son Shiv Menon, from a previous marriage, hugging close 
relatives outside the morgue where her body lay.

Ms
 Tarar, meanwhile, denied any involvement with the Indian minister after
 the scandal was splashed on the front pages of newspapers last 
week.

She took to Twitter to express her shock at Mrs Pushkar Tharoor's death.

'Oh my God,' she wrote. 'This is too awful for words. So tragic I don't know what to say. Rest in peace.'
