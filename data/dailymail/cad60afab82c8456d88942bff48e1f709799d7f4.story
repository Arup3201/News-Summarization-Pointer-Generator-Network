ITV's director of television has admitted Phillip Schofield was 'wrong' in confronting David Cameron with a list of alleged paedophiles on live TV, adding that the action was 'misguided'.

In an interview on ITV News, Peter Fincham said that he would be responding to letters from Lord McAlpine and Tory MP John Whittingdale 'very quickly'.

TV regulator Ofcom has received 415 complaints about last week's incident and has launched an investigation into it.

Interview: ITV boss Peter Fincham, a former BBC 1 Controller, said Phillip Schofield was 'wrong' in confronting David Cameron with a list of alleged paedophiles on live TV

'Misjudged camera angle': The extraordinary moment Philip Scholfield handed the list of names to David Cameron

Mr Fincham said he was 'confident this sort of thing won't happen again'.

He said: 'I think the way This Morning interviewed the Prime Minister last Thursday or that portion of the interview was wrong, was misguided.

'I'm not happy that this happened. We have editorial processes and checks in place and, to be honest with you, they weren't followed so I'm not happy about that but I think the way we have tackled this and responded to this has been quick and decisive.'

Mr Fincham said the channel would 'co-operate fully' with the Ofcom investigation.

He said he was unable to discuss the 
disciplinary action taken against those involved in the production but 
the matter had been taken 'extremely seriously'.

He
added: 'I've spoken to Phillip Schofield myself. He realises his 
mistake. He apologised for it extremely fully and extremely quickly and I
discussed that with him and I think he's under no illusions that this 
was a lapse in ITV journalism; this is something we shouldn't have 
done.'

The Prime Minister takes the card and responds 
with firm words warning of a 'witch hunt' that meant prominent people 
were being wrongly accused of child abuse simply because they were gay

The Prime Minister was visibly taken aback by the stunt and some viewers said names were clearly visible on the piece of paper handed to the Prime Minister

Warning: Andrew Reid, Lord McAlpine's solicitor, has said they know the identity of everyone who has defamed him online

Former BBC One controller Mr Fincham, who resigned from the corporation in 2007 after misleading footage appearing to show the Queen storming out of a photoshoot was used in a trailer, added that Schofield 'stays on air'.

His interview follows a demand by Mr Whittingdale, who is chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, that ITV reveals who was involved in the decision to show Mr Cameron the list during the programme.

Appearance: Phillip Schofield was on the show today but looked subdued throughout

In a letter to Mr Fincham, he said: 'As you are aware, during the interview Mr Schofield presented the Prime Minister with a list of names of individuals alleged to have been involved in paedophilia which it had taken him 'about three minutes' to obtain from the internet.

'I understand that Mr Schofield has apologised for the fact that some of the names might have been visible and that Ofcom is also considering a complaint about this matter.

'However, there has been widespread concern expressed about the decision itself to confront the Prime Minister with such a list.

'I would therefore be grateful if you could say whether or not it is the view of ITV that this represented responsible journalism in the public interest.

'I would also like to know at what level the decision was taken, what legal advice was sought, and what subsequent consideration has been given to the appropriateness of this broadcast.'

Schofield has apologised personally after the list of names - understood to be Conservative Party figures - was briefly exposed on screen.

An ITV spokesman said: 'Last Thursday we began an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the mistake on that day's This Morning programme, for which both Phillip Schofield and ITV apologised.

'This investigation has now concluded and the appropriate disciplinary action has been taken.

'We sincerely apologise because the way in which the issue was raised was clearly wrong and should have been handled differently. We have taken steps to make sure our editorial processes are always properly followed, which was not the case in this instance, and to ensure such an error will not be made again.'

What's your reaction to Ofcom saying they'll investigate ITV? It's very embarrassing isn't it?

PF: 'Well let me say straight away that I think the way This Morning interviewed Prime Minister last Thursday or that portion of the interview was wrong, was misguided. On that day Phillip Schofield issued a statement apologising. We did the same. We launched an investigation straight away. That concluded today, less than a week from the interview. We've issued a fuller statement and we've taken disciplinary action.'

But you say disciplinary action but Phillip Schofield was still on air today. What sort of disciplinary action?

PF: 'I can't discuss in detail what disciplinary action we've taken against those involved in the production. I've spoken to Phillip Schofield myself. He realises his mistake. He apologised for it extremely fully and extremely quickly and I discussed that with him and I think he's under no illusions that this was a lapse in ITV journalism; this is something we shouldn't have done.'

This is terribly embarrassing for ITV. How could this have happened? MPs want to know…

PF: 'In live television all sorts of things could happen, that doesn't mean they should happen and when something goes wrong along these lines we take it very seriously. We move very fast. I'm confident this sort of thing won't happen again. In the meantime that's what we've been looking into in more detail.'

No tougher punishments, no suspensions things like that?

PF: 'I can't discuss the details of the disciplinary action but I can assure you that we think it's appropriate and we have taken this extremely seriously.'

And you've had a legal letter from Lord McAlpine?

PF: 'We have had a letter from Lord McAlpine today and we will respond to that very quickly and I've also had a letter from John Whittingdale and I will respond to that quickly as well. As you say, OFCOM have launched an investigation and of course  we will co-operate fully in that investigation.'

And you're happy that all the steps that should have been taken for that programme were taken? Where was the editor? Where were the production staff? Why was Phillip thrusting this list at the Prime Minister?

PF: 'I'm not happy that this happened. We have editorial processes and checks in place and to be honest with you they weren't followed so I'm not happy about that but I think the way we have tackled this and responded to this has been quick and decisive. I'm happy we won't see something like this happen again on This Morning or any other ITV programme'

Phillip Schofield stays on air?

PF: 'Phillip Schofield stays on air.'
