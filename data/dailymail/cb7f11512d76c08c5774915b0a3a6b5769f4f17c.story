A YouTube video posted yesterday, shows Kobayashi behind a table in front of a crowd of people.

A man holding a microphone tells the crowd: 'We are going to try and drink a gallon milk in a minute.'

As the crowd starts counting down from ten, Kobayashi psychs himself up with the large container of milk.

Holding the carton with both hands, he then starts drinking, taking enormous gulps without a break.

Despite setting the target of one minute, Kobayashi races through the carton. Only a few tiny drops escape from his mouth.

Kobayashi was previously banned from Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest in 2011.

He won the competition every year between 2001 and 2006.
