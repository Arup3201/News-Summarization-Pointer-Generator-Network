The debate over the legalisation of marijuana continues to rage in the US... but it seems a more pressing issue concerns the safety of milk. 

More Americans support a ban on the sale of unpasteurized milk than they do a ban on the sale of marijuana, according to a survey. 

While 46 per cent of those surveyed wanted to outlaw the drug, 59 per cent were against the sale of raw milk.

Unpasteurized milk has become trendy among celebrity food writers and other advocates of unprocessed ‘raw food’, who claim it is both tastier and healthier.

They also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma, hay fever and food allergies in children.

Marijuana, one of the most commonly used drugs in the world, has been legalized in multiple states and many argue that it serves medical benefits that can relieve pain and combat anxiety. 

Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize the possession and use of recreational marijuana by adults in 2012.  

In the results of the Oklahoma State University's monthly food survey of at least 1,000 people, Americans showed even more support for policies that would require country-of-origin labels for meat and lower calorie school lunches

Though both have been up-and-coming in recent years, both have dangerous elements.  

Microorganisms in raw milk can cause serious health risks, including salmonella, E. coli and listeria.

Any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may contain these bugs.

Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. All fresh milk sold in the high street is pasteurised – heated to 72C (162F) for 25 seconds, which kills bacteria.

As for marijuana, many believe it is a gateway drug that can lead users to more serious substance abuse.

Some believe it has permanent affects on the brain.   

In the results of the Oklahoma State University monthly online survey of at least 1,000 people, Americans showed even more support for policies that would require country-of-origin labels for meat and lower calorie school lunches. 

Eighty per cent said they supported policies that would require foods containing DNA to have labels - that includes all fruits, vegetables and meats.

Almost the same amount of people said genetically modified foods should require labels while nearly 70 per cent said restaurant menus should require calorie counts.
