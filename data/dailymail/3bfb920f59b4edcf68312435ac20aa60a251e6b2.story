Sentenced: Lian Enqing, 33, has been sentenced to death for killing a doctor after he was unhappy with his nasal surgery

A Chinese patient who fatally stabbed a doctor after he was left unhappy with his nasal surgery has been sentenced to death.

Lian Enqing, 33, was convicted of killing chief physician Wang Yunjie, 46, and injuring two others in the bloody spree at the ear, nose and throat department of the First People's Hospital of Wenling, Zhejiang Province.

Lian had not been a patient of Dr Wang, but after his requests for further surgery were turned down he burst into the doctor's consulting room armed with a hammer and knife, hitting him over the head and stabbing him several times.

Lian's sister, Lian Qiao, reportedly said her brother 
had frequently complained about his nose, and was having respiratory problems 
and discomfort following his surgery for rhinitis and other nasal problems in March 2012.

Although
 doctors believed that his surgery had been a success, he felt 'cheated' 
at the outcome and reported being in extreme pain.

'While the 
hospital confirmed that the surgery was successful, Lian felt he was 
being cheated by the doctors,' said the sister, according to Chinese news agency Xinhua.

Prior to the killing on October 25 last year, Lian had received treatment for a persistent delusional disorder at Shanghai Mental Health Center, where he was a patient between August and October 15.

However, the court in Zhejiang Province said that medical examinations had shown that Lian was not suffering from the disorder at the time of the killing, and could be held criminally responsible.

He agreed at his trial last week that he was not suffering from mental health problems, but maintained that his surgery had been unsuccessful.

The court ruled that he had committed intentional 
homicide, and sentenced him to death.

Wang Weijie, another doctor who was injured as he tried to restrain Lian, said that the sentence would comfort Dr Wang and the other doctors at the hospital, according to Global Times.

Following the attack hospital staff had staged protests outside the medical centre to call for stronger safety measures to protect against violent patients.
