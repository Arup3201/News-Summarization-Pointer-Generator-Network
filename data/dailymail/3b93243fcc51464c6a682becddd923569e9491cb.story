A knife-wielding man who was shot and killed by a New York City police officer Friday night had previously attacked a regular on Keeping Up With The Kardashians,according to reports.

Jonathan Cheban - a friend of the Kardashian sisters who has appeared in numerous episodes of their reality series - was lunged at by a man in May as he left a sushi restaurant in Brooklyn, but a bodyguard managed to thwart the assailant, TMZ reported.

The attacker, identified as Denis Volchkin, was armed with a knife at the time.

Volchkin was killed by police during a domestic dispute on Friday.

Attacked: Former PR director Jonathan Cheban, a regular on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, was attacked outside a Brooklyn sushi restaurant in May. His assailant was reportedly shot dead by police Friday night after officers were called to a domestic dispute between the man and his mother

Officers were initially called to a home in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn around 5:30 p.m. to address a problem between the man and his mother, but he left before officers arrived, police said.

They were called to the same home again around 8 p.m., when the mother escorted them inside.

The son lunged at the officers with a knife in hand, and an officer shot him once in the torso, police said.

His name and age weren't immediately released.

However TMZ reported that the son was Denis Volchkin, citing law enforcement sources and Cheban himself.

The website also said Volchkin appeared to be on drugs at the time of the attack.

Cheban is the former CEO of public relations firm CommandPR.

He briefly had his own reality show, The Spin Crowd, which was executive produced by Kim Kardashian, but it was axed after one season.

Scene: The shooting occurred at an address in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn around 8pm

Domestic: Police had been called to the home earlier in the afternoon, about 5pm, but the male suspect was not home. They then received another called and returned about 8pm

The confrontation between police and Volchkin came four days after police shot and killed two men — one accidentally — amid another domestic dispute in Brooklyn.

In that case, one of the men, Francisco Carvajal, was carrying a knife and had pushed his way into his ex-girlfriend's apartment Monday night, police said.

After Carvajal had shown up earlier that evening, she had called another man, Rafael Laureano, for help.

As Carvajal used the knife to cut through the door of the bathroom in which the woman had locked herself and her children, officers broke down the front door, and the unarmed Laureano bolted into the apartment, although a sergeant tried to stop him, police spokesman Stephen Davis said Thursday.

Carvajal tried to attack Laureano with the knife, and officers repeatedly ordered Carvajal to drop the weapon, police said. But instead, he came at them, and officers fired at least 10 times, killing both men, police said.

Nine rounds hit Carvajal; one hit Laureano in the back.
