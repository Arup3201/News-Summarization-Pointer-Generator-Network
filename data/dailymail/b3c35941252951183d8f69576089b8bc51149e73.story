Nicole Kidman has opened up about her marriage and family life in a revealing interview.

The actress is honest about the sacrifices she has made for her family and has announced for the first time that her husband filmed the birth of their daughter.

Speaking to net-a-porter.com's weekly fashion glossy, The Edit, Nicole, who swapped life in Hollywood for family in Nashville, says: 'There's only a certain amount you can do once you have a children and a family. They say your art gets affected when you have a family, but I would much rather have a family.

Nicole credits the success and happiness of her second marriage to the fact that the pair met later in life

Nicole, who swapped life in Hollywood for family in Nashville, admits she has made professional sacrifices 

The usually intensely private actress also talks about her marriage to the country singing star, crediting their wedded bliss with the fact they met later in life.

'Keith always says, "We're lucky we met late in life". The sadness of that is that we can't have six kids together, but the greatness of that is we've gone A-Z with all that other stuff, so now we're totally present for this.'

At his concert on their recent wedding anniversary, Urban dedicated a song to his wife with the words, 'Eight years, baby girl. This song is for you. I love you so much.' Even her friends, she says, were jealous. 'I had two girlfriends sitting with me and they were like, "Bitch!" Kidman laughs. 'I went, "Hey! I've been to hell and back!"'
