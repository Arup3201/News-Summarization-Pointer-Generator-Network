These stunning photographs show the huge impact of erosion and other environmental forces on the Earth's natural landscapes.

Taken by geoscientist Nicolas Teichrob - often from aircraft - some of the images are so dramatic they could even be mistaken for works of modern art.

The beauty of the natural erosion 
process was captured by Mr Teichrob as part of a personal project spanning four 
years in areas of Bolivia, Canada, Switzerland and the United States.

Patchwork: This image, captured from an aircraft by geo-scientist Nicolas Teichrob, shows a scenic village near the town of Sorata, in Bolivia surrounded by fields

Clouds: Above the clouds near Chilliwack in British Columbia, Canada. Mr Teichrob has used his expertise in studying rocks and land forms to show how environmental forces effect our landscapes

Snow: Winter on Whistler Mountain in British Columbia, Canada. The scientist captured the beauty of the natural erosion process as part of a four year project which took him around the world

Light: Sunset on Whistler Mountain.
Mr Teichrob from Robert's Creek, British Columbia, sometimes went up in a helicopter to shoot the effects of erosion

Greenery: The grey outline of a dead pine tree stands out amongst a sea of green near Fernie in British Columbia. Trees and other forms of foliage play a key role in shaping the look of many of the landscapes in the collection

One photo appears to show the complex structure of a block of white marble. 

In fact the image is a close-up of sediment flow in an alpine creek in Sorata, Bolivia, created by the movement of the river and a light breeze.

To shoot the effects of erosion on the 
planet, Mr Teichrob, from Robert's Creek, British Columbia, often used helicopters or aircraft with his brother-in-law, Lance Davies,
45.

Contrast: Bridge River in the Coast Mountains near Pemberton in British Columbia. The remains of trees form an island in the middle of the blue green water

Red layers: These intricately layered rock patterns were formed by ancient sand dunes in Zion National Park in Springdale, Utah

Contrasts: The vivid blues, green and browns of a Fraser River tributary near Chilliwack in British Columbia are captured from above

Stunning: What could be mistaken for swirling cloud cover or even sea foam is actually a close-up of sediment flow in an alpine creek in Sorata, Bolivia

Rugged: A tiny Alpine village is seen perched on the edge of a valley near Davos, in Switzerland. The landscape was formed by a mix of natural forces

Branches: A tributary of the Fraser River sends sediment rich water towards the Pacific Ocean near Chilliwack, British Columbia, Canada

Other times he even hiked up mountains overlooking the vistas he was chasing in order to capture the desired shots.

Some pictures in the collection show how other natural factors, such as trees, shape the Earth's landscapes. 

The impact of human activity on the look of the planet is also revealed in a stunning image of the patchwork of agricultural fields surrounding a Bolivian village near Sorata.

Deep: Looking down the steep valley towards the Na Pali coast in Kauai, Hawaii. The floor of the valley is highlighted by a coat of lush green vegetation

Delicate: This image shows fluffy snow pillowed on the riverbed near Pemberton in British Columbia. The whiteness of the snow contrasts with the crystal clear water

Ice and snow: Flying over Baffin Island in Nunavut, Canada. The image, taken from a plane, shows what appear to glaciers amidst the snow-covered peaks

Erosion: Waimea Canyon carved by the erosive power of water in Kauai, Hawaii. The foliage that has grown over the rock has mixed with the dramatic crevices slopes and caves to give this landscape a distinctive appearance

Patterns: Meandering streams and dendritic flow patterns intersect with animal trails in the mountains of Sorata, Bolivia. The lack of heavy vegetation shows the landscape in stark relief

Mountains: Coastal mountains shot from on board a helicopter near Pemberton in British Columbia. Mr Teichrob's photographs capture the drama of many of Earth's most inhospitable environments
