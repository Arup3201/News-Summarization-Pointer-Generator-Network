When a gentle spot of fishing is interrupted by a five-metre crocodile, the first thing most people would do is run for the safety of dry land.

But when 18-year-old Dylan Case came face to face with this maneater, he was cool-headed enough to take a picture - showing the beast with a barramundi in its jaws.

He took the amazing snap two years ago but it went viral last week after he posted it to Instagram accounts fishtildeath and Fishing FNQ, immediately attracting hundreds of likes.

And rather than be scared off by his close encounter, Dylan, from Newell Beach, northern Queensland, is still annoyed he lost out on his prize catch.

‘We were fishing off a bank on a lagoon near Kalpower (in the Lakefield National Park) and we saw these bubbles coming up,’ Dylan told the Gold Coast Bulletin.

‘Suspecting it was a smaller croc, we kept casting and I hooked that fish right next to the bubbles.

‘I fought the fish to the bank but couldn’t drag it up. We usually hook them with a long-handed gaff but we decided to wait and see what the bubbles did just in case.’

‘The croc just lunged out of the water at us, coming within one metre or so from me, before sliding backwards into the water. It saw the barra floundering on the edge and picked it up and sat right there crushing it. You could hear the fish’s bones cracking.’

It was at this point that the cool-headed teen took the picture. After the croc had finished his meal he snapped the line as it swam away.

‘I was pretty shaken up by it,’ Dylan said.
