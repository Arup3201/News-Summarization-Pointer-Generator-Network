Food watchdogs have been accused of a cover-up after it emerged six in ten supermarket chickens carry a dangerous bug.

The contamination is driving a food poisoning epidemic that hits at least 280,000 people a year.

Official estimates suggest the bug, campylobacter – which causes stomach upsets, vomiting and diarrhoea – is responsible for more than 100 deaths each year. It costs the economy about £900million in treating the sick and lost days at work.

The survey results are a damning indictment of supermarkets, farmers and processors who are putting customers at risk every day of the week. The figures were published yesterday by the Food Standards Agency.  But it refuses to name the stores involved, following lobbying from retailers and Whitehall.

Consumer groups and academics say the FSA and the Government are putting the commercial interests of big business ahead of public health. The figures demonstrate that retailers, producers and the FSA have failed to deliver on promises to clean up dirty chicken since the last major survey of campylobacter was published in 2009.

Then, the contamination level was 65 per cent of all fresh whole chicken, while the latest tests put the figure at 59 per cent.

Tests were carried out on 853 birds sold between February and April, with 16 per cent – around one in six – found to have the highest level of contamination. Even the outside of one in 20 packs of raw chicken was contaminated with campylobacter, suggesting that simply picking up a bird to check a price creates a risk.

Until efforts to eradicate the bug are successful, families are being advised to handle chicken carefully and cook it thoroughly.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, called for an end to the secrecy.

‘The FSA’s survey reveals unacceptably high levels of campylobacter and they must now publish the names of the retailers so consumers are aware of the best and worst performing shops,’ he said.

Earlier this year, when it revealed plans for a series of surveys, the FSA announced that it would publish the names of the stores selling the contaminated chicken. It was hoped this would shame the retailers into action. However, this was overturned following lobbying from supermarkets and the British Retail Consortium, the organisation which represents them.

Officials in the food and farming department Defra, which has close links to farmers and processors, also campaigned to keep the details secret. There are even suggestions that the Prime Minister’s office wanted to block the release of names.

The FSA decision to keep the names secret went through only on the casting vote of its chairman, Tim Bennett (left), while Labour environment spokesman Maria Eagle (right) said the FSA must be transparent and put 'the interests of the consumer first'

The FSA decision to keep the names secret went through only on the casting vote of its chairman, Tim Bennett, a former president of the National Farmers’ Union.

Erik Millstone, professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, said the secrecy surrounding the sale of contaminated chicken is ‘deeply disappointing’.

He said: ‘The FSA has failed to keep its promise to the British public. This means that consumers can no longer trust the FSA to put the interest of consumers ahead of those of the food industry.’

Tim Lang, professor of food policy at 
City University, said the FSA had been ‘captured’ by industry interests.
 ‘This is a sad day for British food policy. A quarter of a century 
after the British learned of the extent of contamination of poultry, we 
are back again with unacceptable levels of food-borne pathogens. Then, 
it was salmonella. Now, it’s campylobacter.’

Labour’s
 environment spokesman Maria Eagle said: ‘The Government must restore 
confidence in the food sector and ensure that the FSA is transparent and
 puts the interests of the consumer first.’ FSA chief executive 
Catherine Brown said it will publish a full survey with the names of 
stores, but not until it has more information.

The British Retail Consortium insisted much of the responsibility for tackling campylobacter should be passed to consumers, who can protect themselves by carefully handling and thoroughly cooking chicken. Its food director, Andrew Opie, said: ‘We’re working really hard right across our supply chain but sadly there just isn’t a magic bullet that will get rid of campylobacter because it occurs naturally in poultry.’

Recently, allegations of suspect practices were made about two of the UK’s biggest chicken suppliers, the 2 Sisters Food Group and Faccenda, which supply supermarkets and restaurant chains.

Industry insiders claimed, for example, that chicken which fell on to the floor at two 2 Sisters factories was routinely put back on to the production line.

The FSA investigated and declared the plants involved were operating within acceptable standards.

A Government spokesperson said: ‘As long as the public continue to follow long standing advice on preparing and cooking chicken, campylobacter poses minimal risk to them. Our top priority is the safety of the public and we want people to feel reassured the food they buy is safe.

‘Previous figures have shown around two thirds of poultry to be carrying this bacteria and we continue to work closely with the Food Standards Agency, retailers, processors and farmers to tackle campylobacter in poultry.’
