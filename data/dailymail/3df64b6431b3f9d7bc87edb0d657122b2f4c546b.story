An Arizona pharmaceuticals tycoon asked California's attorney general to review findings that his girlfriend killed herself by tying her wrists and ankles and hanging herself naked from a balcony of his historic mansion, according to a letter released on Tuesday.

Jonah Shacknai said he hoped the review would give 'confidence, comfort and resolution' to those questioning whether Rebecca Zahau committed suicide on July 13 at his Coronado mansion near San Diego.

Mr Shacknai, 54, said he had no reason to doubt findings by authorities in San Diego County that his 32-year-old girlfriend killed herself two days after his six-year-old son accidentally fell while under her watch and died days later.

Suicide: Rebecca Zahau, right, was found hanging naked at Jonah Shacknai's mansion in Coronado, California

Mr Shacknai said his family is being harmed by 'vicious speculation and innuendo in certain media outlets' about the deaths.

'I believe the only way to achieve some dignified resolution for 
everyone who has been touched by the horrible events of this summer will
 be through the efforts of your office,' Mr Shacknai wrote in a letter 
dated September 19 and released by his public relations firm on Tuesday.

Lynda Gledhill, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Kamala 
Harris, declined to comment beyond acknowledging the letter had been 
received.

Investigators believe Ms Zahau tied rope to bedposts and around her wrists 
and ankles. They suspect she loosely tied her wrists together in front of
 her before slipping one hand out, putting her hands behind her back and
 reinserting her wrist into the loop of rope.

They said her DNA was found on a knife, rope and bedposts, along with her footprints on a dusty balcony.

Ms Zahau's family immediately questioned the findings disclosed on September 2 
that included a video reenactment of how they think she bound her 
wrists. The anguished family is hoping the 
sheriff's office will take another look at the case after the pink rope 
cops said she used to hang herself is not visible in a video released 
last week.

Mr Shacknai acknowledged in his letter that the circumstances of 
Zahau's death were 'undeniably strange'.

Zahau family attorney Anne Bremner did not immediately respond to a 
phone message seeking comment on Mr Shacknai's request. Neither did 
officials with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, which ruled 
her death a suicide.

Mr Shacknai is founder and chief executive of Medicis Pharmaceuticals 
Corp, a company based in Scottsdale, Arizona, that makes acne treatments 
Solodyn and Ziana and facial wrinkle treatment Restylane and Dysport, a 
competitor of Botox.

He owns the 27-room waterfront mansion in Coronado, where he lived 
during the summer with Ms Zahau, his girlfriend of two years. His son was 
from a marriage that ended in divorce in 2008.

Officers, however,
 admitted last Monday that there were bruises on Miss Zahau's scalp and a
 T-shirt had been wrapped around her neck and stuffed in her mouth.

Police
 released the extra details about the autopsy report that concluded she 
had committed suicide, after parts were found to have been withheld from
 the public.

They had come 
under pressure to release more information after findings leaked to the 
media showed that there were possible reasons to question the finding 
that she committed suicide.

'As in any comprehensive investigation, some findings cannot be entirely explained,' an official said.

Death: Rebecca Zahau, 32, left, died at the mansion of Jonah Shacknai, 54, right in Coronado, California, in July, just two days after his son Max, 6, who she was looking after, was gravely hurt from a fall off the stairs

'None
 of the observations listed... are inconsistent with the conclusions 
reached regarding the cause and manner of death of Rebecca Zahau.'

Dr
 Lucas said the bruises were minor and may have been caused when Ms 
Zahau slipped over the balcony with the rope around her neck.

The
 t-shirt in the mouth is not unusual, he added. 'It is not clear why it 
was there, although people can place material in her mouth prior to 
hanging,' he said.

He said blood found on her thighs was not the result of rape but probably due to 
an intrauterine device or menstruation. Despite those findings, a 
leading pathologist questioned the suicide conclusion.

Dr
 Cyril Wecht, who has consulted on high profile cases including the 
assassination of President John F Kennedy, the drug overdose of Elvis 
Presley and the OJ Simpson case, said a number of factors in the ruling 
did not add up.

While Dr 
Wecht stopped short of saying it was murder, he is not content to rule 
it a suicide. He said the report needed a lot more scrutiny.

Now you see it, now you don't: The family of 
Rebecca Zahau want authorities to reopen the case after a video shows 
the same mansion balcony without the rope the sheriff's office said she 
used to kill herself

'When
 you put all of this together, it just is bothersome' Dr Wecht told 
KFMB-AM. 'The manner of death I would have left as undetermined.'

On
 the t-shirt, which was removed from her mouth by Mr Shacknai's brother 
Adam when he cut her down, Dr Wecht told KFMB-AM:  'What does she care 
for that? "Gee, I don't want to wake anybody up who may come to rescue 
me."

'I don't know. I'm just
 trying to think. She didn't want to be rescued and didn't want to 
scream so she put it in her mouth? It's absurd.'

Regarding
 the tape residue, Dr Wecht speculated Miss Zahau could have planned to 
 bind her feet with duct tape and then switched to rope. But he added to
 KFMB-AM: 'Well then, where's the duct tape?'

Message: Police covered the writing that appeared on a door in the mansion that allegedly said: 'She saved him, can he save her'

He
 also questioned why her feet were bound.

And Dr Wecht was 
concerned by haemorrhages found under her scalp surface, saying it was 
evidence of blunt force trauma. 'For someone to say there isn't any kind
 of struggle is not correct,' he told KFMB-AM.

It was revealed on September 2 that before she died, Miss Zahau painted a message in black paint on a door.

According
 to Miss Zahau's ex-husband, Neil Nalepa, it read: 'She saved him, can 
he save her.' Her family contends that she did not die by her own hand.

Ms Zahau’s sister Snowem Horwath said: 'Becky did not kill herself, someone killed her.'

'Time will reveal who killed Becky.  I think I know who killed my sister. We are not stupid, she never had any enemies.'

The
 family is calling for a forensic psychiatrist and a criminal profiler 
to investigate the case and say the cryptic message in black paint was 
not in her handwriting.

But authorities said the paint from the message was still on her hands and on the rope when she died.

The death of Max Shacknai, who fell over a staircase railing, was ruled an accident.

His neck was broken and he was found not breathing and with no pulse by Ms Zahau at the bottom 
of the stairs after she heard a noise and came to look. She was the only
 adult at home at the time.

Two
 days later, Adam Shacknai, called 911 to report that Miss Zahau 
appeared to be dead, investigators said. Jonah Shacknai was not at home 
as he was at his son's hospital bedside

When
 Miss Zahau's naked body was found hanging from the mansion's balcony 
with her ankles and wrists bound, investigators were quick to say they 
weren't ruling out suicide.

They eventually determined there was no
 evidence of foul play, sexual assault or a struggle, authorities said. 
She was alive when she went over the balcony and she died by hanging. 
There were no alcohol or drugs in her system.

She died at about 3am and was found at 6.45am by Jonah Shacknai's brother Adam, who was staying in a mansion guesthouse.

Mr
 Shacknai has two children with his first wife, Kimberly. Max was his 
only child with his second wife, Dina, whom he divorced in 2008

The
 home where the tragic incidents occurred, known as the Spreckels mansion, is one of the more storied 
properties in Coronado, a small suburb of multimillion-dollar homes on 
the tip of a peninsula across a bay from downtown San Diego.

The
 home has unobstructed beach views and sits near Coronado's main street,
 which is lined with palm trees and upscale boutiques.

Jonah Shacknai bought the mansion in March 2007, when it was assessed at $12.75million.

The
 home was built in 1908 and named for its original owner, newspaper 
mogul John D. Spreckels, who owned the San Diego Union and San Diego 
Tribune.
