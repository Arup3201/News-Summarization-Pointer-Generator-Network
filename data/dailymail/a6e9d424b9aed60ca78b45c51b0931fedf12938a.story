Angelo Henriquez is hoping that a successful loan spell away from Manchester United will catch the eye of manager Louis van Gaal.

The 20-year-old Chile international will face Glasgow giants Celtic in the Europa League on Thursday evening, as he turns out for loan employers Dinamo Zagreb - where he will spend the season on loan from the Red Devils.

Henriquez is all to aware that he needs to make this loan spell in Croatia count after previous spells at both Wigan Athletic and Real Zaragoza, but insists the temporary move to Zagreb is not a step down.

He said: 'I don't think it was a backwards step in my career (joining Dinamo) but a good chance to play and get experience of European football.

'Dinamo is a special challenge for me because I know the club aspires to be the best in Croatia and that will help me achieve my goal. I have constant contact with people from Manchester United.

'Not (Louis) van Gaal, but people from Carrington, the coaches. They want to know every detail – from the intensity of training here, diet, life in Zagreb. With that amount of care for a year, I know I'm still being followed by United.'
