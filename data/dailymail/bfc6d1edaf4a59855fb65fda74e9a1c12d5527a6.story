Conservative MPs have swapped the racy Fifty Shades of Grey for the more serious political biography of Margaret Thatcher as their top choice of summer reading, a survey has revealed.

While last summer saw EL James's novel top the reading list of Tory MPs taking a summer holiday, this year's favourite was the hefty biography of Margaret Thatcher, by ex-Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore.

There was little appetite for light reading this year, with another serious-minded tome - a biography of the political philosopher Edmund Burke written by fellow Tory MP Jesse Norman - coming in as second favourite, the ComRes survey revealed.

Labour MPs were equally partisan, making former home secretary Alan Johnson's childhood memoir, This Boy, their number one choice.

Second place went to the work of another former Labour minister - Lord Adonis's account of the formation of the coalition, Five Days In May.

The book provides an analysis of the events leading up to the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in May 2010.

Liberal
Democrats meanwhile were seeking to burnish their 'green' credentials, 
choosing environmentalist Tony Juniper's What Has Nature Ever Done For 
Us?

1 Margaret Thatcher - Charles Moore

2 This Boy - Alan Johnson

3 Five Days In May - Andrew Adonis

4 Edmund Burke - Jesse Norman

5 Modernity Britain: Opening The Box - David Kynaston.

The book looks at how nature provides the 'natural services' which enable the economy to keep going.

In joint third choice for Conservatives MPs meanwhile was Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, Sir William Slim's Defeat Into Victory and Bill Cash's John Bright, according to The Telegraph.

The overall top five books among MPs of all parties also included David Kynaston's Modernity Britain: Opening The Box.

MPs started their summer recess on July 18. The House of Commons will not sit again until September 2.

A total of 157 MPs were asked about their summer reading choices by ComRes between June 26 and July 24.
