An artist has sculpted a series of models of cars, planes and boats that are quite literally good enough to eat - because they're made entirely out of pasta.

From a macaroni motorbike to a linguine lorry, the mini pasta-pieces were created by Serghei Pakhomoff.

Mr Pakhomoff, 43, from Perm, Russia uses various types of pasta to create miniature models of cars, planes, boats and even a small pasta town.

Art that's good enough to eat: Artist Serghei Pakhomoff spends up to 30 hours making miniature models out of pasta - such as this pumpjack

The amateur artist came up with the idea for his al-dente artwork when he was asked to help create an advert for a Russian macaroni company.

The advertising campaign was eventually cancelled but Mr Pakhomoff's inspiration for pasta stuck with him and he's been creating the models in his spare time ever since.

He said: 'I use all kinds of pasta from simple spaghetti and lasagne to farfalle and ruote, spending between 20 and 30 hours on each of my models.

Mr Pakhomoff's creations vary from a macaroni motorbike to a linguine lorry to spaghetti airplanes

'The hardest model to create was the car, it has reclining front seats, doors that actually open and lots of other small details like mirrors, so it was very fiddly.

'And my most time-consuming project was a small town which took three years to complete.

'For me, creating these artworks helps me to unwind and relax, and so I'm surprised yet pleased people have taken such a big interest in my work.'
