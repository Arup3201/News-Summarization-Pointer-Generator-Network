She became a mother for the first time just six months ago, so, like most new mums, sleep will probably be in short supply.

But always one to keep up appearances, the 33-year-old, who gave birth to baby North in June, has revealed the beauty secret that helps keep those tell-tale dark circles at bay.

The reality TV star is a fan of Shiseido's Benefiance Pure Retinol Instant Treatment Eye Masks.

Beauty secret: How does Kim Kardashian hide those new mother dark circles? With Shiseido's Benefiance Pure Retinol Instant Treatment Eye Masks, she has revealed

Writing about the product on her blog, she said: 'This keeps my eyes looking fresh and free of any dark circles!'

Shiseido’s eye masks, which cost £59 for a pack of six, making them £4.91 each, claim to act immediately to tackle wrinkles, dryness and dark circles.

The brand say that the Pure Retinol Eye Mask saturates the eye area with pure liquid retinol - one of the most powerful anti-ageing ingredients on the market (only the best for Kimmy, of course).

The sheets are contoured to fit the under eye region and promise that in 15 minutes uneven texture, fine lines and crow’s feet are visibly improved and hydration is increased by 98 per cent.

'These quick-fix masks are a must for regular and emergency use; perfect for a pre-night out pick me up,' say the brand.

Kim also cites Dr Lancer The Method: Polish as one of her favourite products, which uses exfoliation beads and fruit enzymes to remove dead skin sells.

She also raves about MorrocanOil, which she says keeps her locks silky and, of course, can't get enough of her own Kardashian beauty range.

 Kim's sleek new look didn't come easily, with the reality star putting 
herself through gruelling workout regimes, including kicking off each 
day with 100 squats, to help her shed the pounds.
