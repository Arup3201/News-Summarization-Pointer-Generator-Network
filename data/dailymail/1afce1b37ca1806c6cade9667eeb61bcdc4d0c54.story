Borussia Dortmund's CEO has slammed Bayern Munich for commenting on the future of star man Marco Reus.

Hans-Joachim Watzke is unhappy that Bayern chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenige has hinted that the German champions could make a move for the German international having also discussed the player's contract. 

Having signed Dortmund striker Robert Lewnadowski already this summer, Watzke is not impressed with the Bavarians approach.

TIn a statement released on the club's website, Watzke said: 'Borussia Dortmund must note with a certain annoyance that Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is currently bad-mouthing BVB's internal affairs through the media in the three-day rhythm.

'We are sure that, for every football fan, it is obvious what the intention is behind such statements. 

'We assume that Karl-Heinz Rummenigge accepts that he is further damaging the already tense relationship between Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. 

'We will continue as we always have, of course, by never giving out our views on contract details of our players publicly.'

Meanwhile, Reus could move clubs for just £19.8million after details of his release clause were leaked. 

The highly-rated Germany forward has Europe's top clubs circling after two successful years at Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga.

Liverpool are known admirers while Manchester United have also been linked but it was widely believed that Reus would command a fee closer to £30m, pricing the Reds out of any move.  

The clause becomes active next summer and German paper Bild has reported that interested clubs have been told he will be available for a knockdown fee.
