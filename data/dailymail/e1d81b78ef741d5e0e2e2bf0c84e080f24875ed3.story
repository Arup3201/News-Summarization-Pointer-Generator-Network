A mortgage rate rate war among banks has seen the average home loan drop by £1,700 in just four weeks.

Borrowers are being offered cheaper rates as lenders compete to attract customers – and experts predict record-breaking deals to come. 

The largest savings were for those with a 10 per cent deposit, according to figures from the broker London & Country.

First Direct offers one of the best five-year rates on the market at 2.28 per cent. The bank will also today unveil an all-time low package that locks customers in at 2.89 per cent for a decade.

HSBC has been offering customers with a 40 per cent deposit a two-year deal on 1.19 per cent, according to figures analysed by The Daily Telegraph. 

Lenders are able to offer rock bottom rates after economists widely predicted the Bank of England would not raise its base rate from its historic low of 0.5 per cent until as late as next year.

Long-term deals give homebuyers the peace of mind of knowing that they will be locked into affordable repayments even if interest rates rise sharply.

Experts say rates will dip even further, with two-year rates set to fall below 1 per cent and five-year deals below 2 per cent. 

Aaron Strutt, from Trinity Financial, said: ‘For fixed rates to go below one per cent would be extraordinary.’

Mark Harris, managing director of SPF private clients, told the Telegraph: ‘Lenders are keen to advance more money this year and they’re cutting their prices to attract customers.

‘Banks will hope to make money by selling customers other products such as current accounts and credit cards.’
