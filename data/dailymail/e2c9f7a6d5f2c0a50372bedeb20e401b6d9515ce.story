Even simple skateboarding tricks can be... tricky.

So attempting to ride completely upside down takes nerves of steel and a great deal of talent.

Luckily, Aaron 'Jaws' Homoki of Phoenix, Arizona, has bravery and skill in equal measure.

On Sunday, in front of a watching crowd at Vista, California, he zoomed around a 15-foot (4.6 meter) loop - and managed to stay on his board.

Topsy-turvey: Homoki is almost upside down and looking stable

Incredible: The skater is captured completely upside down

Wheely impressive: Fortunately Homoki's crash helmet wasn't put to the test

This is by no means the first time that he has wowed the skating community with his derring-do.

The 23-year-old, regarded as one of the best skaters in the world, was videoed in July 2011 flying over 20 concrete stairs and making a perfect landing.

He doesn't have a monopoly on amazing skateboarding stunts, though.

Last year 12-year-old Tom Schaar pulled off a stunning 1080 spin (that's three full rotations) in Tehachapi in California and repeated the incredible trick later that year to take gold in an X Games Asia competition.

Extreme skater Danny Way, meanwhile, flew 79 feet (24 meters) over the Great Wall of China in 2005 - at a height of 23 feet (or seven meters).

And in 2011 Shaun White pulled off a trick so complicated that it's almost impossible to describe. His final run in the X Games Skateboard Vert competition featured a 'heelflip body varial frontside 540' that left the crowd feeling dizzy.
