The boos rang out around the DW Stadium as Wigan’s alarming slide towards League One continued. Worse still for manager Malky Makay, it was his old club Cardiff City pushing him in the wrong direction.

Owner Vincent Tan and his board boycotted the fixture in protest over Wigan’s decision to offer Mackay a route back into football last November following his sacking and acrimonious departure from South Wales 11 months earlier.

But the Cardiff players certainly turned up against their old boss, and Aron Gunnarsson – one of the key figures in the team that Mackay led to the Premier League in 2013 – scored the only goal to pile more misery on the Scot.

A fourth home defeat in a row leaves Mackay with a woeful record of just two wins from 17 games in all competitions since taking over, and fighting an increasingly desperate battle to save Wigan from disappearing into League One.

They remain nine points from safety with 13 games left to play.

He also remains under investigation by the FA over allegations – revealed by Sportsmail – that he sent sexist, racist and homophobic text messages during his time as manager of Cardiff, while Wigan chief Dave Whelan was hit with a £50,000 fine and six-week ban for comments he made in Mackay’s defence. 

Whelan was missing from his usual place in the directors’ box last night despite completing his ban and returning from Barbados earlier this month, and Wigan filled the seats vacated by Tan and his entourage with members of local charities.

Two Cardiff directors made the trip to the north-west and sat with the away fans who chanted Mackay’s name in what was his first meeting with his old club. 

‘That was something I’m immensely proud of,’ he said. ‘I had a terrific time in Cardiff and loved being with the people at the football club. I tried my very best for the club at every opportunity.

‘To get that response is something that will live with me. It was lovely and I’ m delighted that they chose to that.’

Mackay was less impressed with the match officials for disallowing two efforts from James McClean and Martyn Waghorn when TV replays suggested that both players were narrowly onside.

‘The referees’ association text me yesterday to apologise on behalf of the linesman for the first goal at Bournemouth. I would imagine there will be another one on the way,’ he added.

The defending that led to Gunnarsson’s goal in the 20th minute summed up Wigan’ s current malaise.

There appeared to be little danger when Kenwyne Jones headed the ball down to the Iceland international on the edge of the box, but James Perch and Harry Maguire got in each other’s way in their attempts to tackle Gunnarsson who then beat a third opponent before casually rolling a shot past Ali Al Habsi.

Cardiff’s first victory in nine games lifted them 10 points clear of the relegation zone, and manager Russell Slade dismissed suggestions that the build-up surrounding Mackay had any effect on the match.

‘Honestly not at all,’ said Slade. ‘We just prepared exactly the same. Both teams wanted to win the game for their own reasons.’
