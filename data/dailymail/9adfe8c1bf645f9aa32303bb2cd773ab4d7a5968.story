Leicester manager Nigel Pearson is confident big-name signing Esteban Cambiasso will not upset the team harmony he has worked hard to nurture during his time at the club.

The Foxes pulled off a surprise transfer coup this week in attracting former Argentina international Cambiasso to the King Power Stadium.

Cambiasso has made clear, even at the age of 34 and after winning numerous trophies during his previous 10 years with Inter Milan prior to his release this summer, he is eager to make history with City.

BORN: Argentina, August 18 1980 (age 34)

Playing position: Central midfielder

1998-2001: Independiente (98 apps, 14 gls)

2001-2002: River Plate (37, 12)

2002-2004: Real Madrid (41, 0)

2004-2014: Inter Milan (315, 41)

2000-2011: Argentina (52, 5) 

But, as has been witnessed at numerous clubs in the past, such a stellar acquisition can often have an unsettling effect on those around them.

Pearson, however, has no doubt about the type of player and character Cambiasso is, especially after seeing how well he was received by his new team-mates on Friday.

'He's been welcomed into the group, as you would expect him to be,' Pearson said of the 52-times capped international.

'The players have been quite excited about the prospect of having somebody of that stature in the game being alongside them.

'But Esteban will view himself as one of the players, one of the squad, which is a very positive thing.'

Pearson also believes Cambiasso will be able to teach him a trick or two given the player's 'world-wide experience'.

'I, like anybody, have a capacity to keep learning,' Pearson added.

'Certainly if somebody comes with the wealth of experience he has, I will probably - if I've an open enough mind - continue to learn from people like him.

'I don't see that as being anything other than positive. Managers learn as much from players, as players do from managers and coaches.

'I've always had that sort of view, and hopefully I'll continue to learn from my players as well.'

Whether Cambiasso makes his debut in Sunday's home game with Arsenal depends on whether he receives international clearance.

The clash with the Gunners continues City's tough run of fixtures to start their return to the Barclays Premier League following a 2-2 home draw with Everton and 2-0 defeat at Chelsea.

Pearson has told his players what he expects.

'It is another big game against one of the most successful sides of the modern era in English football,' he said.

'They are a side that has an exceptionally good blueprint as to how a football club should be run.

'But our philosophy is we have to play to our strengths, without being naive or gung-ho.

'We have to be ruthless in both penalty boxes to get the better of the top sides.'

Pearson is hopeful of attracting two more players to the club before the transfer window closes at 11pm on Monday.

One of those appears to be QPR defender Danny Simpson, with the other Lokomotiv Moscow striker Dame N'Doye.

'We'll try and get two more players,' Pearson said.

'If we can do that, fine. If we can't then, as I've said in the past, I'm happy with the players I have.

'It's more out of our desire to have a strong enough squad to go from window to window.

'It's not that I don't have faith in the players I have. You know I do - I speak about it all the time.

'I'm very proud of what this group of players have achieved to get here.'

Aside from the prospect of Cambiasso making his debut, Pearson has midfielders Marc Albrighton and Danny Drinkwater and striker Jamie Vardy available again following injuries, but midfielder Matty James (shin) and defender Matthew Upson (foot) are definitely out.
