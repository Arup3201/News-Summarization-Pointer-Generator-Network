Qantas will make 100 of its pilots redundant for the first time in more than 40 years as part of a broader plan to cut costs.

The airline is seeking 100 redundancies from the 550 captains and first officers who fly Boeing 747 and 767 planes.

The redundancies form part of the 5000 jobs cuts Qantas announced in February after the company posted a half year loss of $235 million.

Qantas is seeking 100 pilot redundancies as they move to retire several Boeing 747 and 767 planes

Qantas chief pilot Captain Dick Tobiano sent an email to pilots on Tuesday asking for voluntary redundancy applications, according to the ABC.

Mr Tobiano said the airline had a pilot surplus following the conclusion of a number of leave without pay periods and accelerated plans to retire its 747 and 767 fleet.

Qantas announced in February that its remaining 767 planes would retire in the first quarter of 2015, while six older 747 aircrafts would exit the fleet by early 2016.

Australian and International Pilots Association president and Qantas 737 pilot, Nathan Safe, said the voluntary redundancies were preferable to compulsory redundancies, but he was urging Qantas to offer fair packages to its employees.

'Obviously from AIPA's perspective it is far better to see fleet reductions managed with older pilots stepping out on their own terms, rather than younger pilots being made redundant compulsorily,' Mr Safe said.

He said while the decision was regrettable, the association would work with Qantas to ensure the process was managed with 'as little pain to individual pilots as possible.'

'AIPA is now negotiating with the company to ensure the voluntary redundancies offered fairly reflect the typically long years of quality service invested by Qantas pilots,' Mr Safe said.
