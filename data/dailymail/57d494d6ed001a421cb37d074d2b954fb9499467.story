A former Cirque du Soleil acrobat broke his neck instead of a world record when he attempted to flip through 10 panes of glass. 

Jesus 'Half Animal' Villa, from Las Vegas, slammed head-first into the glass in July and has spent months in hospital recovering.

The daredevil now hopes to raise $100,000 to help pay for his 'ultimate comeback'.

Jesus Villa breaks his neck instead of world record...attempting to go through 10 panes of glass

He already had a successful operation in July this year and but needs help with the costs which would also cover nursing and physical therapy.

Villa wrote on Fundrazr: 'All I feel is pain, and remember what happened as it plays back in my mind.

'I had multiple, multiple fractures in my neck. There is no man or person alive with so much titanium down there (sic) neck and spine that's walking.'

The stuntman has raised just over $6,000 so far. 

In 2012 Villa set new records for 'longest flip over a vehicle' and '18 front flips on spring-loaded stilts.'

In
 December 2012, friend and model Pamela Anderson gave her support when 
he planned to 310 miles on spring-loaded stilts from Las Vegas to Los 
Angeles.

In 2010 had his left hip replaced before setting two Guinness World Records 11 months after.

But not everyone is supportive on Villa's fundraising page.
