A mother has defended her choice to undergo a controversial fertility treatment that helped her get pregnant with her now-teenage daughter.

Sharon Saarinen became pregnant via a process called cytoplasmic transfer, which involves injected a donor egg into the mother's egg to boost the egg's health. 

However, the treatment has now been banned in the U.S. and is currently under investigation for possible health risks to the child. 

'I think it was the only thing that helped me. If there were risks, it didn't matter. I wanted a child too much at that point, Mrs Saarinen told The Independent. 'It was definitely the right thing to do.' 

Mrs Saarinen's daughter Alana is now a healthy teenager who is doing well in high school.

'The right thing to do': Alana Saarinen (right) was conceived through a controversial technique called cytoplasmic transfer. She sits at home with her mother Sharon, who says she does not regret the decision 

But there are concerns that the treatment compromises the health of the child, many of which inherit DNA from three parents. 

The Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey is now investigating what - if any - are the ill effects of the now-halted fertility technique 

Before it was banned, the technique helped up to 30 women conceive, about 17 of which came from Saint Barnabas. 

Why now? Around 17 babies were conceived at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science at Saint Barnabas Medical Center using cytoplasmic transfer, a now banned technique. Now, well over a decade later, the clinic is reportedly looking into long-term effects on the children for the very first time

Only two of those children, both now in their teens, have been named.

One of them Alana and the other is Emma Ott, a Pittsburgh girl who became the first ever child born after being conceived by the 3-parent technique when she arrived happy and healthy in 1997.

Today, Emma is a healthy teenage girl in high school.

According to the Independent, neither has been checked for long-term health issues that could be related to the technique.

Hopeful: The new techniques help women with faulty mitochondria, the energy source in a cell, from passing on to their babies defects that can result in such diseases as muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, heart problems and mental retardation. About one in 200 children is born every year in Britain with a mitochondrial disorder.

At the time Alana and Emma were conceived, scientists were using cytoplasmic transfer in the hopes it would increase the chances of successful conception in patients for whom traditional IVF had been unsuccessful.

What it also did was transfer the donor's mitochondrial DNA--which is passed along only by mothers--into the fertilized egg.

That left the egg carrying the DNA of three parents: donor, recipient and father.

In Emma, researchers said there was no lasting trace of the donor's mitochondrial DNA. According to the Independent, Alana has not been tested.

However, some of the some 30 three-parent babies conceived worldwide did retain a third DNA.

Before the technique could become more widespread, the U.S. halted the use of the largely untested technique. 

A call made to the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science by MailOnline was not immediately returned.

Reports of their investigation into children like Emma and Alana come just as Britain is considering legalizing more advanced and refined three-parent conception techniques.

But instead of boosting fertility, scientists in Britain as well as the U.S. now want to transfer mitochondrial DNA as a means of preventing mitochondrial diseases from being passed on from mother to child.

The new techniques help women with faulty mitochondria, the energy source in a cell, from passing on to their babies defects that can result in such diseases as muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, heart problems and mental retardation. About one in 200 children is born every year in Britain with a mitochondrial disorder.

Ill effects? Babies born with the help of a New Jersey fertility clinic using a technique that put the genes of three parents into an egg are now teenagers

For a woman with faulty mitochondria, scientists take only the healthy genetic material from her egg or embryo. They then transfer that into a donor egg or embryo that still has its healthy mitochondria but has had the rest of its key DNA removed. The fertilized embryo is then transferred into the womb of the mother.

Some groups oppose artificial reproduction techniques and believe the destruction of eggs or embryos to be immoral. British tabloids jumped on the procedure when it was first announced in 2008 and labeled it the creation of a three-parent baby — the mother, the donor and the father — a charge scientists claim is inaccurate because the amount of DNA from the donor egg is insignificant.

Seventeen babies were born using this treatment starting 15 years ago

The process was developed to encourage better fertility in IVF patients by splicing the eggs of two women

Children born through this method may inherit DNA from three parents

The U.S. government halted the technique in 2001 and only now is the health of the conceived babies - now teens - being followed up on by the IVF clinic
