A surfboard belonging to legendary Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson which featured on the covers of two of the iconic band’s early albums is set to be auctioned for $150,000.

A classic piece of rock memorabilia, the blue and yellow fiberglass board was used for the cover of the Beach Boys' groundbreaking debut album, 1962's Surfin' Safari, and again in 1963 on the front of Surfer Girl.

Legend has it that Wilson - the band's only real surfer - brought the nine foot board along to the band's first ever professional photo shoot held at Paradise Cove in Malibu, California, in 1962 shortly after they had signed with Capitol Records.

Surfin' U.S.A. : Legend has it that Dennis Wilson, holding the board and the band's only real surfer, brought the nine foot board along to their first ever professional photo shoot held at Paradise Cove in Malibu, California, in 1962 shortly after they had signed with Capitol Records

The five members - Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine - were snapped holding it while striking various poses on a beach. The photos, taken by Ken Veeder, went on to become some of the most iconic images of the band.

Wilson gave the board to his close friend Louis Marotta in the 1970s who in turn passed it on to Beach Boys fan Bob Stafford in 1985.

Stafford was a huge Beach Boys fan and named his son Brian after Brian Wilson.

Bob Stafford is now selling the board after loaning to the year-long exhibition Good Vibrations: 50 Years Of The Beach Boys, which ran between September 2012 and September 2013.

The then current Beach Boys line-up posed in front of the board during the exhibition at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles.

The board came from a Hermosa Beach, California surf shop called The Outrigger, as evidenced by the shop's logo decal visible at the rear of the board.

Dennis Wilson spent many pre-Beach Boys days riding the waves on this board at crowded local beaches and saw first-hand how popular the sport of surfing had become.

He later suggested to his big brother Brian that he write a song about the craze. The result was Surfin', which became their debut single.

The surfboard, which has never been restored, is just over 9 feet long, 21 inches wide and approximately three inches thick, with a 12 inch tall fin, which is 12 inches wide at the base. It weighs approximately 25 pounds.

These days the band is a shadow of its former self.
 Founding members Carl and Dennis Wilson are dead, and Brian Wilson, the
 sole survivor of the three brothers, has been embroiled in a series of 
divisive lawsuits with Love, another founder.

This 1985 photo, right, was taken the day that Bob Stafford picked the board up at Louis Marotta's house. Louis is the bearded adult and Brian Stafford, then 14 and named after the legendary Brian Wilson, is standing beside him

Brian Wilson suffered a prolonged mental collapse at the height of the band's glory years, but has re-emerged as a successful solo performer in the last 20 years, although he often appears fragile in public.

‘He wrote some of the best pop songs of all time,’ said Neil Warnock, chief executive of The Agency Group Worldwide, a leading concert organizer.

‘They were absolutely riveting two- and three-minute pop songs. The more serious stuff, Pet Sounds, resonates with every single generation as being a classic piece of music. He's written a canon of music that is absolutely essential. He just thinks in five-part harmony.’

None of that changes the fact that the board is undoubtedly one of the most incredible 
pieces of Beach Boys memorabilia to ever hit the market, Rockaway 
Records is acting as the Stafford's official agent in promoting the sale.
