'Tactical': Policies announced by David Cameron have been criticised as ill-thought-out and not up to the task of combating terrorism

David Cameron’s anti-terror plans came under fresh attack yesterday amid claims he proposed the crackdown to shift attention from the embarrassment of a Tory MP defecting to Ukip.

In a major Commons statement on Monday, he vowed to introduce measures to bar British fanatics fighting in Iraq and Syria from re-entering the UK, either by stripping them of their passports or stopping them boarding flights back home.

But critics suggested Mr Cameron had ratcheted up the rhetoric to try to ‘bury bad news’ after Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell stunned Westminster by defecting to Ukip last week.

Labour MP Ian Austin, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘David Cameron used the most apocalyptic language to tell us that we faced a generational struggle against the threat of jihadists to Britain.

‘I agree with him. Tackling extremists and extremism to prevent British people becoming terrorists at home and abroad is a huge priority.

‘But the measures he announced were a damp squib. They did not amount to much more than tough talking. It looks very much like he was playing politics with security to deflect attention from the problems he is having within his own party.’

In a further blow to Downing Street, the independent reviewer of terror laws warned there would be ‘significant difficulties’ in stopping British-born suspects re-entering the country.

It also emerged another proposal, to force terror suspects living in the UK to be relocated away from other militants, might be blocked by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader.

The criticism increased the sense of disarray surrounding the ‘targeted’ package of proposals unveiled by Mr Cameron.

A senior Tory criticised Downing Street for briefing ill-thought out terror policies.

He said: ‘They don’t think, “Let’s get a serious set of policies that may solve the problem.” They think, “Let’s brief something that will get rid of this problem for the next 72 hours.” It is tactical media management, nothing else.’

David Anderson QC, the counter-terrorism watchdog, said there were ‘legal difficulties’ with stopping British-born citizens who had been fighting abroad from returning to the UK, as rendering them stateless would breach international law.

The Prime Minister also wants to force airlines to hand over advanced passenger information to the security services or be banned from landing planes in the UK.

Mr Anderson said: ‘The whole concept of citizenship is about the right of abode... if you’re going to suspend that, even on a temporary basis, I think you run into some legal difficulties.

‘Where does the person go? Do they go back to Syria for a bit more jihad? Do they go and find a beach somewhere in Turkey?

‘The trouble with this game of pass the parcel, whether it comes to terrorists or other criminals, is that if other people’s terrorists or criminals find their way to Great Britain, they too could say, “Well we wash our hands of these people, we’re not going to let them back, they’re your problem”.
