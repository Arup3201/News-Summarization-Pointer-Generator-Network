Aleisha Worrell falsely claimed to police that she had been abducted, tied to a lamppost and raped

A 20-year-old woman has been jailed for making up a false report claiming she was kidnapped, tied naked to a lamppost and raped.

Aleisha Worrell lied to police that innocent Sean Hibberd had abducted her for a brutal sexual assault.

A court heard how Mr Hibberd, 35, was held in custody for nine hours for 'intimate' physical examinations in the rape investigation.

But Worrell confessed she was lying after detectives discovered her evidence was 'full of holes'.

She said she wanted revenge on Hibberd because he was 'harassing' her boyfriend in a neighbourhood feud.

Worrell told officers she had been abducted by a masked man before being tied to a lamppost.She claimed she was raped and left for three hours before being released.

Prosecutor David Pugh said Worrell contacted the emergency services last December saying she had been abducted.

Mr Pugh said: 'She claimed he had taken her to a road junction where he stripped her and himself, raping her as she remained tethered to the lamppost.

'He had then dressed and left her tied up for three hours before returning to free her.

'She then claimed that she had been dizzy when she had arrived at the police station after he had injected her with something after the alleged rape.'

Mr Hibberd was arrested at 2.55am and underwent investigation. He was 'intimately examined' by a female police doctor at Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.

Police spent 14 hours investigating the allegations before realising she had been lying because her story was 'full of holes.'

The court heard that not only was the area well lit but there were workmen nearby who would have had a clear view.

When confronted Worrell broke down to say: 'It’s all lies. I made it up because Sean was harassing me and my boyfriend and the police did nothing to him.'

Worrell’s lawyer Clare Fear said: 'She is extremely sorry for the effect on Mr Hibberd and appreciates the severity of her position.'

Worrell, from Merthyr Tydfil, admitted perverting the course of justice and was sent to a young offender’s institution for 18 months.

Judge Eleri Rees told her: 'The wider issue is that you made the position of those who have truly been raped much more difficult.

'Make the most of the assistance given to you and the education available and you will come out more mature and more sensible and will never offend again.'
