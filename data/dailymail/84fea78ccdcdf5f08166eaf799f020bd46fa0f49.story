A newlywed couple whose big day was ruined by bungling wedding photographers who took 'horrific' pictures have rewritten history after recreating the entire event - including their first dance.

Anneka Geary, 27, and husband Thomas, 32, were distraught when they received their badly framed and out-of-focus wedding photos.

The couple had paid Ian McCloskey and Nikki Carter £750 to cover their special day last August.

But when their wedding album did not feature a single usable shot, they immediately complained.

Happy ever after: Anneka and Thomas Geary have restaged their wedding after they received a nightmare set of photos from the original event in Rugby, Warwickshire, last August

The original collection of shockingly poor photography included the back of guests'
heads and a snap of the bride's mother whose face was completely 
obscured by her hat.

The photographer failed to take a single frame 
of the groom's parents at both the church and the reception, which was held at Dunchurch Park Hotel near Rugby, Warwickshire.

One picture of the couple signing the 
marriage register appeared to feature a ghostly hand clutching a 
toy motorbike where the photographer tried to edit out Mrs Geary's 
three-year-old nephew Harry, who was standing in the background.

The images of the evening reception, which
hosted 120 guests, were taken without a flash because one of the 
photographers complained about being epileptic.

The couple, from Warwick, demanded a 
full refund for the 'nightmare' wedding album but received less than 
half after the firm, Westgate Photography, went bust.

Cut above the rest: A kind-hearted wedding photographer took pity on the couple after seeing the pictures and offered to do them again for free

Original set: An awkward side shot of the couple cutting their wedding cake - the photo's framing is questionable at best and Mrs Geary isn't even looking at the camera

But now they finally have a perfect wedding album after photographers from all over the country inundated the couple with offers to recreate their special day for free.

So the Gearys returned to Dunchurch Park Hotel to recreate some of the abysmal shots.

One of the new photos shows the couple in 
the hotel grounds looking lovingly into each other's eyes in a warm 
embrace, whereas the original had them standing awkwardly metres apart.

And a fuzzy shot of the couple cutting their wedding cake was re-shot so that their grinning faces are clearly visible.

The bridegroom's parents, who didn't 
feature in a single shot in the original set, beam at the camera as 
they posed on the hotel steps.

A shot of the couple's first dance, which came out blurred, shows blushing bride Mrs Geary twirling in perfect focus.

Generous make-up artists and the local registrar gave their services for free to recreate last August's £14,000 ceremony.

Mrs Geary said: 'We were really 
disappointed when we got the original pictures back because so much 
planning had gone into the day and the photos were unusable.

'We were delighted when the local photographer agreed to recreate the wedding pictures.

'It was lovely occasion and I loved 
the chance of getting dressed up in my wedding dress again - it was like
getting married all over again.

'We even recreated the first dance which was really special.'

Second chance: Mr and Mrs Geary pose in picturesque woodland as they recreate their special day

Sarah Fox, who runs Jems Photography 
with her husband John, offered the couple the chance of a second wedding after 
seeing the original batch of pictures.

She said: 'We heard what had happened and pulled a few contacts to give them the day they should have had in the first place.

'No-one deserves to have their pictures ruined by photos that aren't very good.

'They came to see the photos after 
they were done and were absolutely thrilled, they sat there crying with 
joy saying "this is how they should have looked".'

Picture perfect: The Gearys have finally got the wedding album of their dreams after restaging their big day

Inept: The couple said almost every shot they originally received 
was terrible - including a blurry shot of the  including one of the happy couple 
walking through a doorway with a stack of cardboard boxes in the 
foreground

This snap of the couple signing the marriage register appears to feature a ghostly hand clutching a toy motorbike - but it's actually where the snappers tried to edit out Anneka's three-year-old nephew Harry

The back of a guest's head appears in the foreground of this wedding shot. The photographers even failed to take a single frame of the groom's parents

Not much better! This photograph shows wedding guests turning to look at something more interesting behind them - and even the ones facing the front aren't looking at the camera

Blurry: The pictures of the evening do attended by 120 guests were also taken without a flash

Not in focus: The couple, from Warwick, demanded a full refund for the 'nightmare' wedding album but received less than half after the firm went bust

A picture of the couple from behind and a 
shocking shot of the the couple at a distance at their wedding reception
are not what anyone would expect from professional photographers

Cheers! The guests are photographed - largely from behind - raising their glasses to the happy couple, who are nowhere to be seen in this picture
