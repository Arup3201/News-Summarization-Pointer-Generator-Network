No need to get the violins out for the owner of a rare Stradivarius that was thought lost - it appears to have been found.

Police in Milwaukee say that the rare 
multi-million dollar Stradivarius stolen from a concertmaster last month
 has been recovered in Milwaukee.

Authorities are working to confirm the violin is the one stolen from Frank Almond 
in a brazen attack outside Wisconsin Lutheran College in Milwaukee January 27.

'It has to be confirmed 
as to the actual authenticity of what it is,' said Lt. Jeffrey Norman. 
Police will contact experts to provide that confirmation, Norman said. 
He did not comment on the condition of the recovered violin.

Loss: Frank Almond, right, had just finished a concert when he was attacked by a robber who stole his violin

Rare: The Lipinski Stradivarius, crafted in 1715, was on permanent loan to the concertmaster

Prosecutors confirmed Wednesday that 
three people have been arrested in connection with the theft. Two men, 
ages 41 and 36, and a 32-year-old woman, are in custody and could be in 
Milwaukee County Circuit Court Thursday.

Almond
 was walking to his car following a performance at the college when 
someone jumped out of a van, shocked him with a stun gun and seized the 
Stradivarius, which was on loan to him.

The robber got back into the 
waiting vehicle, which sped off.

Almond
 was knocked to the ground but wasn't seriously hurt. 

He was devastated 
by the loss of the violin, which was crafted in 1715 and has been 
appraised for insurance purposes at $5 million. The owner of the violin 
has not been revealed.

The 
case in which Almond kept the instrument was found, and the Milwaukee 
Symphony Orchestra announced someone was offering $100,000 for the 
instrument's safe return.

A message seeking comment from the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra wasn't immediately returned Thursday.

The
 violin is known in musical circles as the 'Lipinski' Stradivarius.

Its
 
previous owners include virtuoso Giuseppe Tartini, who was known for his
 'Devil's Trill' Sonata, and Polish violinist Karol Lipinski.

The violin had been previously owned by a string of high-profile musicians, including Devil's Trill composer Giuseppe Tartini, wand Polish violinist Karol Lipinski.

The Lipinski Stradivarius was crafted in 1715 by Antonio Stradiveri.

An early owner was composer Guiseppe Tartini, who gave it to his student, Salvini.

Salvini passed ownership to Polish violinist Karol Lipinski. After Lipinski played for him, Salvini is said to have smashed the musician's violin, before handing him the Stradivarius and saying, 'Try this instrument'.

After Lipinski's death in 1861 the violin was acquired by Engelbert RÃ¶ntgen, and it stayed with his family for three generations.

In the 1940s the violin was sent to Cuba, where it was owned by a supporter of the Havana Symphony. But after fleeing the revolution, the violinist was forced to sell the instrument so he could start a new life in the U.S.

It was bought in New York in 1962 by Evi Liivak, an Estonian who played secret concerts to keep spirits raised during the Nazi occupation.

In 2008, Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra's  Frank Almond was given the violin on permanent loan.

It had survived the Cuban revolution, during which its sale helped a Havana musician escape to the U.S., and was used in concerts across Europe by a woman who escaped the Nazis.

'The artistic heritage of Milwaukee was assaulted and robbed last night,' Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said.

Mr Almond, who studied at the Juilliard academy in New York, was left incapacitated on the sidewalk after being hit by a taser, as the thief fled to a maroon or burgundy minivan that was waiting nearby.

The violin's case was found, empty and discarded, near the scene of the attack.

Only a few hundred Stradivarius violins, crafted by Antonio Stradiveri, remain in the world.

Mr Almond was offered the use of the violin in 2008, when a family clearing the estate of a dead relative contacted the concertmaster to ask his opinion of an instrument they had found. 

In an interview with The Violinist last
 year, Mr Almond recalled how he had at first been skeptical, saying 
that he is regularly contacted by people who believe they have found a 
rare instrument.

After
 meeting the owners, who showed him paperwork and old concert programs, 
Mr Almond was led to a bank vault where the precious violin had been 
stored for 20 years.

'It
 turned out that they had put it in a bank vault - a regular bank vault 
at M & I Bank, which happened to be about, I'd say, 100 yards from 
the concert hall,' Mr Almond said.

'It was ironic - I'd been playing all the time in this hall, and there was a 1715 Strad, down the street in a bank vault.'

The violin had an impressive pedigree, and allowed Mr Almond to perform on an instrument once used by 'godfather of modern violin playing' Tartini, and Lipinski.

'If you start thinking about everything behind that instrument, it's easy to feel quite tiny,' Mr Almond said in a previous interview. 'Sure, it was creepy to play the Devil's Trill sonata for the first couple times. But that's what the violin is for: playing.

'It's going to be here a lot longer than I am, and every day that I'm able to play on it, to me, it's amazing.'

Its last owner had been a child prodigy from Estonia, whose music studies in Budapest were cut short when her father was killed by the Gestapo.

Evi Liivak was known for playing secret concerts in bunkers to raise the spirits of those living under Nazi oppression.

She took possession of the violin in New York in 1962, when her husband, a Milwaukee pianist, bought it for $19,000 from a Cuban who was forced to sell it after escaping Havana.

Its enticing history led Mr Almond to record A Violin's Life in tribute to it. The CD features him playing pieces that had been composed or were associated with its various owners in the past 300 years.

Although the violin needs to be played regularly to keep it in good condition, the aged instrument must also be kept in a temperature-controlled environment to preserve it.

Estimates
 vary for the number of Stradivarius violins that still exist, said 
Lisbeth Butler, the secretary of the American Federation of Violin and 
Bow Makers. Most experts believe that 600 to 650 remain.
