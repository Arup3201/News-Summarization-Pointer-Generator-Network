The traditional bobby on the beat is being replaced with ‘plastic policemen’ and volunteers, a watchdog warned yesterday.

They say PCs are left to deal with paperwork while cheaper civilians pound the streets.

Some neighbourhood teams are entirely staffed by Police Community Support Officers, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary found.

It cautioned that the changes are ‘eroding’ the ‘cornerstones’ of policing. Critics fear the move could weaken confidence in the thin blue line.

HMIC said chief officers are diluting local teams to bolster the ranks of response officers who answer 999 calls - a move which could turn policing into a ‘reactive’ service, damaging efforts to cut crime.

Officers are also often too busy with paperwork in stations to patrol the beat, the HMIC said.

The findings came in a review into how forces across England and Wales are dealing with budget cuts. It found PCSOs are being asked to take on more responsibility despite having less training.

Meanwhile the number of volunteers is set to rise by 60 per cent by 2015.

Constables said they no longer do the ‘walking and talking’ and are losing touch with the public.

The report said: ‘Officers therefore may still be described, and officially counted, as neighbourhood officers, but are actually doing much wider policing work.

‘As a result, PCSOs – who do not have 
warrants, and therefore, for instance, cannot make arrests – are now the
mainstay of community policing in some areas.’

Zoe Billingham, of HMIC, said: ‘We have spoken to hundreds of police officers of many ranks who say their work has changed. We are very concerned about some of these changes.

'Neighbourhood policing is a cornerstone of British policing - not something that is simply "nice to have"'

Zoe Billingham, of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary

‘They are spending less time out in communities and more time in stations doing investigative work. Neighbourhood policing is a cornerstone of British policing - not something that is simply “nice to have”.

The watchdog’s analysis revealed there will be 31,600 fewer officers and staff in March 2015 than there were in March 2010.

Steve Williams, chairman of the Police Federation, said the report ‘paints a worrying picture’ of officers being ‘pulled away’ from policing their neighbourhoods.

He said: ‘Neighbourhood policing plays a pivotal role in reducing crime.

'If this form of preventative policing is falling by the wayside then how many crimes are now going unreported because an officer is not there to spot suspicious behaviour?’
