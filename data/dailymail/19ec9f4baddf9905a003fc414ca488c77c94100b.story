Harriet Harman's  Older Women’s Commission is seeking to redress the balance of men and women over 50 in prominent roles in TV.

Their research has found that just five per cent of the presenters on our screens are women aged 50 plus, as 'older women fall into a black hole in broadcasting' and are 'airbrushed' from our screens when they age.

Anna Ford, 69, for one, has complained that is all down to ageism and sexism and that women should 
not be 'shown the door' as soon as they have a grey hair or wrinkle when
the same doesn't apply to men.

But one female commentator is far from sympathetic. Freelance journalist Carol Sarler said these women who now have 'sour 
grapes' about their lack of opportunities on telly only have themselves 
to blame.

Too late to complain: Carol Sarler, left, said women like Anna Ford, right, should have spoken out about sexism in TV in their youth

Writing today in The Times,
she says they should have thought about their career longevity in their youth - when they instead were happy to trade on their looks in order to get ahead of 'plainer' women.

She said: 'The problems didn't start when on-screen women got older; they started when they were 25 and perfectly happy to muscle past their 
plainer-Jane colleagues by primping and preening themselves into what 
passes for contemporary beauty: big eyes, glossed lips, defined breasts,
dieted hips.'

She said that women such as Joan Bakewell and Selina Scott 'tacitly colluded' with the TV tradition that women were not there to 'present the news but to decorate it.' And so they shouldn't be surprised that their greying hair and wrinkled skins means this is no longer a possibility.

'They sold their souls to the Devil decades ago and now comes playback,' as Carol puts it.

She adds that women like Ms Ford should not resent the men like David Dimbleby and John Simpson who are still on TV in their twilight years.

She said it's 'irrelevant' that these men now look like 'dinosaurs' because they were never hired for their looks in the first place.

Labour deputy leader Miss Harman wants the lack of older women on TV to be readdressed.

She said: 'It is not that women aren’t there. It 
is that they get to a certain age, then they find they are near the exit
and they get pushed out the door.'

Miss Harman previously raised the issue of ageism in TV in parliament in 2009 when Arlene Phillips, 66, was sacked from the panel of Strictly Come Dancing in favour of Alesha Dixon, 30.

'I think it's absolutely shocking that Arlene Phillips is not going to be a judge on Strictly Come Dancing. And as equality minister, I am suspicious that there is age discrimination there,' she said at the time.

Figures released by Miss Harman's commission this week reveal that the BBC employs just 25 women aged over 50 out of 413 regular presenters.

This is better than Channel 5 and ITN, who do not employ any older women presenters at all, and Sky News, which has only one.

Former Countryfile presenter Miriam 
O’Reilly, 56, who won a landmark ageism case against the BBC in 2011, 
said the latest figures were 'shocking'.

Meanwhile, Esther Rantzen, 72, told the Daily Mail that the figures didn't come as a surprise to her as she would 'collapse in shock' if she was offered another 
mainstream presenting job. She said older women were only given 'token' roles.

But Ms Sarler believes rather than bemoaning the system, change has to come from women themselves.

She said today's generation of presenters should consider their long-term careers when they are younger and rely on their knowledge, not their appearance, to get ahead.

She explained: 'As the men have proved, start as you mean to go on and you go on longer.'

They should have traded on knowledge, not appearance, in their youth

Instead they 'preened' themselves to 'decorate' the news
