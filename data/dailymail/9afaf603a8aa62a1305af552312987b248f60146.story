Thousands of anti-government protestors have descended on Thailand's capital - leading to violent clashes with police.

Demonstrators hurled rocks, bottles and petrol bombs at riot officers today as they attempted to storm government buildings in Bangkok.

They were met by volleys of rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons.

Violent clashes: Thousands of anti-government protestors have descended on Thailand's capital, Bangkok

Attack: Demonstrators hurled rocks, bottles and petrol bombs at riot officers, while carrying flags

Force: Police put up barricades and fired back rubber bullets, volleys of tear gas and water cannons

Anger: A protestor prepares to throw a tear gas cannister back at riot police outside Government House

It is the eighth day of protests aiming to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.

Last night, three people were killed - and a further 103 injured - by gunfire in fierce skirmishes at a Bangkok stadium.

Today, more than 2,500 military personnel were deployed to tackle the clashes, which became so violent that Ms Yingluck was forced to flee to a nearby compound.

The protestors - wearing bandanas, gas masks and plastic bags on their heads - surrounded Government House, pulled at barbwire barricades and seized police vans.

They also besieged state television 
stations - demanding they broadcast the demonstrators' views and not the 
government's.

The violence has prompted Thailand's government to urge the capital's 10million residents to stay indoors overnight.

Some of Bangkok's biggest shopping malls have also been closed.

Today's clashes mark the first time police have used force since the protests began a week ago - a risky strategy that many fear could lead to more deaths.

Until this weekend, the 
demonstrations had been largely peaceful.

Injured: An injured protestor is helped by other demonstrators during the clashes, which have prompted Thailand's government to urge the capital's 10million residents to stay indoors overnight

Overcome: A woman suffers a coughing fit after inhaling some of the tear gas near Government House

Struggle: Other protestors hold cloths over their noses and mouths as they suffer the effects of the cannisters

However, last night's incident saw rival groups 
clash at a large pro-government rally in a stadium in northeast Bangkok - leaving three dead and dozens wounded.

Protestors are calling for the 
overthrow of Ms Yingluck, who they believe has abused her party's 
majority to push through laws that strengthen the behind-the-scenes 
power of her self-exiled brother and former premier, Thaksin Shinawatra.

The
 demonstrations have raised fears of fresh political turmoil and 
instability in Thailand, which is one of southeast Asia's biggest 
economies. 

They have also posed the biggest threat to Ms Yingluck's administration since she came to power in 2011.

Today, protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban unexpectedly announced that 
he had met with Ms Yingluck - claiming he had told her he would accept 
nothing less than her resignation and a new government of an appointed 
council.

In a defiant tone that drew cheers 
from his supporters, Mr Suthep said the meeting was held under the auspices of the military, which claims it is
 neutral in the conflict. 

He added that the talk had not constituted negotiations.

Many
 anti-government protestors have dubbed today 'victory day' - despite failing to achieve
 their main goal of overthrowing Ms Yingluck's government.

However, Mr Suthep told his followers it would take 
another two days for their end goal to be reached.

'If Prime Minister Yingluck 
Shinawatra listens to the people's voices, we will treat her like 
gentlemen because we all are good citizens,' he said.

Spokesmen for both the prime minister and the army have refused to comment on the alleged meeting.

However,
 government spokesman Teerat Ratanasevi has said Ms Yingluck is not 
expected to make a public statement tonight - adding that the prime 
minister is currently residing in a 'safe place'. 

Political instability has plagued Thailand since the military ousted Ms Yingluck's brother Thaksin in a 2006 coup.

Two years later, anti-Thaksin 
demonstrators occupied Bangkok's two airports for a week after taking 
over the prime minister's office for three months.

And
 in 2010, pro-Thaksin protestors flocked to downtown Bangkok for a
 standoff that ended with parts of the city in flames and more than 90 
dead.

Any further 
deterioration is likely to scare away investors, as well as tourists who
 come to Thailand by the millions and contribute 10 percent to the $602 
billion economy.

Army commander General Prayuth Chan-ocha - who said last week the army would not take sides - has urged the police not to use force.

He has also called on protesters to avoid violence, according to an army spokesman.

Most of the protesters are middle-class Bangkok residents who have been part of the anti-Thaksin movement for several years.

Others include people brought in from the opposition Democrat Party strongholds in the southern provinces.
