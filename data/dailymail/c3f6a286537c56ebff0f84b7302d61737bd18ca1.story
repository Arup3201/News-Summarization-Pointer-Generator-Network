The Saturday's gave holidaymakers in Ibiza a big surprise by rocking up at their hotel for an exclusive gig - and you can get a first look at their performance here.

The girls - Frankie Sandford, Rochelle Humes, Mollie King, Una Healy and Vanessa White - kept a video diary for MailOnline Travel readers as they jetted out to the White Isle to help celebrate 10 years of First Choice All Inclusive Holiday Villages. 

And guests couldn't believe their eyes as the British girl group took to the stage to provide the evening's entertainment at the First Choice Holiday Seaview Village.

The show included the first ever performance of the group's cover of David Guetta and Kelly Rowland's When Love Takes Over as well as their hit tracks Higher and Ego.

Earlier in the day The Saturdays had dropped by on youngsters learning moves to their hit song Higher at The Razzamataz kids club.

Vanessa said: 'The kids were so amazing. It was a very special day'.

Guests were left raving abut the experience, telling MailOnline Travel: 'It was the icing on the cake of our holiday.' 

The band's cover of David Guetta and Kelly Rowland's When Love Takes Over will be released on August 10th as a bonus track to the new single What Are You Waiting For.
