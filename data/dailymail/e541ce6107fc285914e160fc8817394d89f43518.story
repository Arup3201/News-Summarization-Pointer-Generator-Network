An Alabama man has admitted defeat in his four year legal battle to keep his wife’s body in a grave just yards from his front porch.

James Davis’ decision to back down comes after the Alabama Supreme Court rejected his appeal earlier this month.

Davis, 74, said his wife Patsy's dying wish in 2009 was to be buried in front of their log home in downtown Stevenson. The couple had been married for 48 years.

James Davis, holding a photo of his dead wife Patsy, has agreed to have her remains dug up and cremated before he buries them outside his home in downtown Stevenson, Alabama

Now he has agreed to have her body dug up and cremated, provided he can put her ashes back in the grave.

His wife’s request, he said, had been based on the fact that she was afraid of cremation, but enough time has now passed.

‘If she saw herself as she is now, I know she would not mind,’ he told the New York Times.

Davis has spent several thousand dollars in a legal battle over the grave, but admitted after the supreme court’s decision on October 11 that he didn’t have the money to pursue the case any further. 'I still ain't got no justice,' he said.

Loved one: Davis buried his wife in his yard in 2009 on her request and had hoped to be buried there too

James and Patsy Davis were married for 48 years and had five children

The couple both grew up in Dayton, Tenn., and first met when she was seven and he was 11 and he asked her to accompany him to a strawberry festival.

'We went on that one date, and it was me and her the rest of the time,' he said. They were married for 48 years and had five children.

In her later years, his wife suffered crippling arthritis, and Mr. Davis retired from his job as an electrical worker to take care of her until her death in April 2009.

Shortly before her death, Mr. Davis said, she expressed her wish to be buried in the yard of the house where they had spent three decades together.

The City Council rejected Davis' request for a cemetery permit for his yard after his wife died, but he buried her a few feet from the front porch anyway.

The headstone, which Davis keeps surrounded by flowers, is visible from the street.

The city sued to make Davis remove the grave, arguing that laws prohibit people from using their yards as burial grounds inside the city limits, and a judge last year ordered Davis to move the remains to a licensed cemetery.

The removal order was placed on hold to give a state appeals court time to rule, but Edmiston said the order would be enforced now that the Supreme Court sided with the town of 2,600 residents.

In her later years, Patsy suffered crippling arthritis and so James retired from his job as an electrical worker to take care of her until her death in April 2009

The 
city contends the grave at Davis' home is an illegal cemetery that falls
under government oversight, said the city's attorney, Parker Edmiston.

'We're not in the 1800s any longer,' he said. 'We're not talking about a homestead, 
we're not talking about someone who is out in the country on 40 acres of
land. Mr. Davis lives in downtown Stevenson.'

Edmiston said the man rejected several compromises from the city, including the offer of two plots in the municipal graveyard.

Davis had planned to be bury beside Patsy after he death, and he hopes that his five children and 15 grandchildren will care for the property from then on.
