Exeter Chiefs qualified for the quarter-finals of the European Rugby Challenge Cup after they defeated Connacht 33-24 on Sunday.

Connacht led 17-10 at half-time following tries from Matt Healy, Willie Faloon and Danie Poolman, with Exeter staying in touch through a penalty try after a succession of scrums and a penalty and conversion by Harry Slade.

The Chiefs moved ahead after the break when Dean Mumm scored from an interception, which Slade converted, with Don Armand's try from close to the line putting the visitors 30-17 up after fly-half Slade added the extras.

Healy scored again for Connacht to give the hosts a try-scoring bonus point, with Jack Carty kicking his second conversion of the match, but Exeter held on for victory.

The result means Exeter qualify with 20 points in Pool Two, with Connacht five points behind in second place.

It was a welcome return to form for Rob Baxter's men as they brought to a halt a four-game losing streak having been defeated in their last four matches in the Aviva Premiership.

Exeter will wrap up their European pool campaign at home to Bayonne on January 24 while Connacht, who would have gone top of the group with victory, travel to La Rochelle next weekend in search of one of the runners-up spots.
