The widow of a young BP engineer killed in the  Algerian terrorist siege paid tribute yesterday to her ‘amazing’ husband.

Sebastian John, 26, the father of a seven-month-old son, had been sent to the desert only one week before the attack.

His devastated wife Nicola, 29, said: ‘Sebastian was the most amazing person. He was a fantastic husband, father, son and brother.

‘There won’t be a moment that goes by where we won’t think of him. We are so proud of Sebastian for all he achieved in his life.

‘He was taken away from us too early 
and in the most tragic circumstances. We will always love him, he will 
be forever in our hearts and eternally missed.’

Mr John was a civil engineer for BP 
and and only arrived in Algeria a week before the siege, which has 
claimed the lives of six UK nationals.

'We will always love him, he will be forever in our hearts and eternally missed.'

He had recently moved from Nottingham to Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey, where BP's HQ is located.

Mr John was privately educated at Norwich School between 1997 and 2004  and attained a first class honours degree in civil engineering from Loughborough University in 2009.

He worked as a graduate trainee at the civil engineering firm Arup in Solihull and at another firm called Tony Gee and Partners.

He was chairman of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) East Midlands Graduates and Students Group last year and wrote on the organisation's website that civil engineering was a 'discipline which affects everyone in every walk of life'.

Richard Coackley, former president of the ICE, said: 'Sebastian was a talented young civil engineer with the world at his feet.

'His mild-mannered, supportive nature made him a pleasure to be around and his commitment and passion for his work and his young family shone through in all that he did.

'It was an absolute honour and a pleasure to have him as my apprentice last year and I know he will be greatly missed by all.'

His brother’s church, the Priestly Fraternity of St Peter, issued a statement which read: 'We have learnt of the execution of Sebastian at the hands of his Muslim captors.

'Please pray for the repose of his soul, for his widow and baby boy, and for the conversion of his assassins.'

The announcement comes as efforts continued to repatriate the victims' bodies.

A total of 37 foreign workers are believed to have died at the remote desert facility - part-operated by BP - which was overrun by heavily-armed terrorists on Wednesday January 16.

Some 29 of the hostage-takers died, while three were captured by Algerian troops during a special forces mission to end the four-day stand-off.

Three of the Britons killed have been named as 46-year-old security expert Paul Morgan, systems supervisor Garry Barlow, 49, from Liverpool, and 59-year-old planning manager Kenneth Whiteside, from Glenrothes, Fife.

Colombian BP executive Carlos Estrada, who lived in London, is also believed to have died.

The family of a British survivor said today they were overjoyed that he is safe and well, but need time to come to terms with what has happened.

In a statement issued through the Foreign Office, Lou Fear’s loved ones said: 'The family is greatly relieved by Lou’s safe return.

'This has been a very traumatic experience for the whole family, especially Lou. Our thoughts are with Lou’s colleagues and their families.

'We now need to start the process of coming to terms with what has happened and need time alone to do this. We therefore ask that the media respect our privacy.'

The Foreign Office refused to confirm any further details but Mr Fear, 56, who reportedly lives in Louth, Lincolnshire, and was working as a team leader for BP, hid when the raid on the refinery began, then walked for 20 hours to reach safety.

Another Briton reported to died in the siege is Carson Bilsland, from Perthshire.

He had reportedly worked in Algeria for around two years as a testing technician and was a former member of the British speed ski team.

The Government is considering increasing logistical support for the French-led military campaign against rebels in neighbouring Mali.

Prime Minister David Cameron has insisted the UK is 'not seeking a combat role', but armed forces units have reportedly been placed on 'high readiness' to deploy.

Mr Cameron has said there will be a global 'generational struggle' against Al Qaeda-inspired Islamist terrorism in North Africa.

He pledged to provide intelligence and counter-terrorism assets to help track down and dismantle the terror network responsible for the attack in Algeria.

BP group chief executive Bob Dudley 
has said the company 'feared the worst' for four of its 18 employees who
have not been found safe.

'We have been gravely concerned for these colleagues and feared one or more fatalities among their number,' he said.

'It is with great sadness that I now have to say that we fear the worst for them all. We are doing all we can to support their families and ask everyone to show them consideration and to respect their privacy.'

Forensic experts from the UK, US and Norway are working with the Algerian authorities formally to identify a number of bodies found at the site.
