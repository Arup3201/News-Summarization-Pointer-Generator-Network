Monica Cruz for Agent Provocateur

They've already proved they have remarkably good genes when it comes to looks.

Now two of Spain's sexiest sisters, Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz, 38, and her younger dancer sibling Mónica, 35, are putting their heads together to see how good they are when it comes to designing underwear.

The duo have announced they will be launching a collection of lingerie, in collaboration with luxury knicker brand Agent Provocateur.

The Agent Provocateur diffusion line L'Agent will be designed by the Cruz sisters alongside the creative direction of Agent Provocateur's Sarah Shotton.

It will launch for the Autumn/Winter 2013 season in key department stores worldwide.

Penelope Cruz, who is married to Spanish actor Javier Bardem, with whom she has a one-year-old son, Leo, said: 'It is so exciting for me and Mónica to embark in this new adventure.

'We have always been huge fans of Agent Provocateur and both of us are very much looking forward to this long term collaboration. We feel extremely happy to become part of this great team.'

But is not the first time the Cruzes have been associated with the brand.

Shotton said: 'Mónica Cruz was sensational in our Autumn Winter 2012 campaign, 'Wilhelmina: Show Your True Self, and Penelope Cruz has always been a muse for Agent Provocateur.

'Penelope and Mónica are both long-time lingerie fans and have brought a new design sensibility to the brand. Working with the Cruz sisters was a great opportunity to bring the diffusion line to life and to further strengthen the brand’s relationship with them.'

Garry Hogarth, CEO of Agent Provocateur said: 'We are pleased to be able to offer L'Agent to a wider audience. The L'Agent collection will be broader than the main line while remaining true to the Agent Provocateur brand DNA.

'We have been talking about the possibility of a diffusion line for some time and the partnership with the Cruz sisters has come at the perfect time. We are aiming to secure two to three key retailers in each global territory for the launch season.'

Penelope and her sister Mónica have already fronted campaigns and designed collections for Mango and Samantha Thavasa.

Agent Provocateur was founded by Joe Corre and Serena Rees in 1994, opening its first boutique in Soho, London.
