A miracle baby who survived three rounds of chemotherapy while her cancer-stricken mother was pregnant has died in a tragic accident just weeks before her second birthday.

Four months into her second pregnancy, Cincinnati, Ohio woman Shana Ficks found a lump in her breast and was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer. Doctors recommended she terminate the pregnancy but Mrs Ficks refused, so the pair suffered through treatment together. Kelsey Ficks was born on October 17, 2011, a healthy 6lb 10oz, and her mother recovered.

But last month, in a heart-breaking twist of fate, Kelsey was killed when she fell backwards on her chair into a glass cabinet while her mother stepped outside for less than two minutes.

'We are confused because she fought so hard to get here. Why would she be taken?' Mrs Ficks told Cincinnati.com.

'Both of us just feel so empty,' her husband, David Ficks, added. 'I just want her to walk around the corner and hold her.'

The couple were eager to have children as soon as they married 10 years ago and easily became pregnant will their first daughter Taylor.

In February 2011, they fell pregnant with Kelsey, but soon they were faced with the difficult decision of whether to abort the baby, following Mrs Ficks' diagnosis.

'I wanted the baby so bad. It was just a miracle she came to us,' she said. 'No, she was not going anywhere.'

So the chemotherapy began.

'Kelsey went through the chemo too,' Mrs Ficks said. 'She was my strength. She gave me everything.'

Two months after the birth, Mrs Ficks had a double mastectomy and underwent radiation before beginning a breast reconstruction.

However, she developed an infection that almost killed her so decided to forgo further surgeries to focus on caring for her girls.

'Just being with my kids is the happiest I've ever been in my life,' Mrs Ficks said.

She
 recovered and thankfully her breast cancer didn't return. For the next 
year, she devoted herself to her babies and husband, snuggling up with 
Kelsey on the couch, painting with the girls at the dining room table.

However, by August 2013, the cancer drugs she had been taking had caused a cancerous polyps on her uterus. On August 14, she had a full hysterectomy.

A week later, she was back at home, and while her husband, family and neighbors had been helping out as she recovered, that day she was alone with the children.

Taylor had been swimming in the family's pool before Mrs Ficks set both girls at the dining room table to paint.

Kelsey sat in her usual spot at the head of the table. Behind her, against the wall, was a towering glass and wood cabinet.

'She didn't want to be in a high chair,' her father said. 'She wanted to be in a regular chair like her sister.'

Just as they began painting, Taylor told her mom the family's Labrador retriever was soaking wet outside so Mrs Ficks slipped out the back door for 'not even a minute and a half' to towel her off.

With the back door shut, she heard nothing unusual. But as soon as she came back inside, Kelsey was crying and walking toward her with blood gushing from her head.

Later, Taylor, the only witness, told sheriff’s investigators Kelsey put her feet up and pushed against on the table, shoving the chair back into the cabinet.

Mrs Ficks instinctively grabbed something to apply pressure before calling 911.

'Oh my God!' she screamed. 'My baby - I was outside real quick turning off the hose - apparently she fell back and hit the glass. She is bleeding out!'

Later in the three minute call, she added to the dispatcher: 'Her head and her ear are cut in half.'

Then Kelsey stopped breathing, and the desperate mother attempted to resuscitate her.

When paramedics arrived, they rushed Kelsey to Mercy Hospital Anderson, and a medical team worked furiously worked for 45 minutes before the toddler started breathing again.

'They had tears in their eyes,' Mrs Ficks added. 'They were crying, trying to help her.'

She was then air lifted to Cincinnati Children's Medical Center, but tragically lost her battle 30 minutes after she arrived.

Because of the severe head laceration, the parents weren't able to pick her up. 'She was so beautiful, laying there,' Mr Ficks said. 'Just so cold.'

While they were saying goodbye, the paramedics returned to the family home and cleaned it until it was spotless.

This isn't in their job description, but the squad didn't want the already distraught family to have to clean Kelsey's blood off the floor when they arrived home.

'Nobody should have to go through a tragedy like this,' Anderson Township Fire Battalion Chief Fred Buop said.

Moved by what they had done, the Ficks' invited the fire squad to Kelsey's service.

'They were the last ones there with us as I held her in my arms and she died,' Mrs Ficks said. 'I definitely wanted them there.'

The family is leaning on family, friends and their faith to keep them going after the unfathomable tragedy.

'She had a story,' Mrs Ficks said. 'She was an angel to us and now ... she's our guardian angel again. We just want her back with us again.'

She added: 'It's been hard because you do question - after everything we've been through - your faith. But I have to believe she is up there. I have to believe she is safe and sitting in God's arms... And one day we will all be together again.'
