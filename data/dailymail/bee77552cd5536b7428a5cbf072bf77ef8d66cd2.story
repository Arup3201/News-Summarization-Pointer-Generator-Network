Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris apologised after being caught on film apparently admitting he encouraged his friend James Delingpole to stand against the Conservative candidate in Corby

The Conservative campaign manager in the by-election to replace Louise Mensch as MP for Corby has been caught on film admitting he encouraged a rival candidate.

Chris Heaton-Harris today apologised after footage emerged in which he suggested his friend James Delingpole had put his name forward to stand against the Tory party candidate.

Mr Heaton-Harris, MP for Daventry, was filmed saying it was 'part of the plan' to 'cause some hassle' in the Corby by-election by making wind farms a major issue ahead of polling day.

Ms Mensch stood down in the summer, claiming she could not juggle family life and the demands of being an MP.

The Tory party candidate is Christine Emmett, and Mr Heaton-Harris was put in charge of the campaign to get her elected in the vote, which is being held tomorrow.

But he was filmed discussing how he persuaded Mr Delingpole, a newspaper columnist, to also throw his hat into the ring.

Speaking to a Greenpeace activist posing as a wind power opponent last month, Mr Heaton-Harris said: 'There's a bit of strategy behind what's going on. I'm running the Corby by-election for the Tories ... And Delingpole, who is my constituent, and a very good friend... put his head above the parapet but won't put his deposit down... It's just part of the plan.'

In another exchange published by The Guardian, he appeared to admit to persuading Mr Delingpole to consider standing.

'Please don't tell anybody ever. But he will not be putting his deposit down. He just did it because it's a long campaign, it's six weeks to cause some hassle and get, and get people talking.'

Louise Mensch triggered tomorrow's Corby by-election when she quit as the MP to move her family to the US

Mr Delingpole withdrew from the race two weeks ago the day after Conservative energy minister John Hayes controversially told the Daily Mail the development of onshore wind farms would be reined in.

Mr Heaton-Harris today issued a statement apologising for his behaviour: 'The quotes attributed to me range from factually correct statements to me bragging about things beyond my control, which has so often before been the failing of politicians.

'The implication that I choreographed any sort of 'secret plan' is simply not the case and I apologise if that is the impression given.

'It can hardly be said that my wanting to "put this on the agenda" is new. I have spent years fighting on-shore wind, getting over 100 MPs to sign a letter to the Prime Minister, securing debates and raising questions in Parliament and touring the country speaking to anti-wind groups.

'It is a subject I am passionate about and will continue to work on until communities across my constituency, Northamptonshire and the country have the protection they deserve.'

The revelation sheds further light on Tory party splits on wind power.

Last night Mr Hayes repeated his opposition to onshore turbines, telling Channel 4 News that Britain has planned enough windfarms and it is 'end of story' for the technology.

Labour frontbencher Michael Dugher said: 'This is yet more evidence of the Conservative Party in chaos.

'It is astonishing that a Conservative MP appears to have encouraged a rival candidate to run in a by-election in order to campaign against windfarms. David Cameron needs to get a grip on his divided and out of touch party.'
