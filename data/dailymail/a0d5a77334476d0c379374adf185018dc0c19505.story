Military chiefs have been accused of dishonoring the war dead over plans to put 60,000 solar panels on the famous runway at Pearl Harbor's Ford Island.

The Navy wants to erect a 7ft tall fence on the site and turn it into what critics claim will be a 'monstrosity' in a bid to make itself more green.

It has chosen the site because it claims the airfield is not in use - even though the memory of events still lingers on.

Outrage: The Navy plans to install 60,000 blue solar panels on the runway at Pearl Harbour's Ford Island. Critics say the panels (pictured in a mockup for the project) will make it look like the runway's made of Legos

The runway at Ford Island was where the US military tried to launch planes to try and counter attack during the Pearl Harbor raid on December 7, 1941.

Some 33 of the 70 craft stationed there were destroyed as Japanese aircraft slaughtered 2,402 Americans and wounded 1,282 during the surprise offensive.

In 1964 the runway was designated a National Historic Landmark and its iconic red and white control tower has featured in films such as ‘Pearl Harbor’.

Now, however, the Navy wants to disregard all that and turn it into a solar farm.

Going green: Solar panels (like those at the Solarmine facility in Taft, California) will help the Navy reach its goal to get 50 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2020

Ken DeHoff, director of the Pacific Aviation Museum on Ford Island, called for other sites to be considered.

He said: 'We totally agree with (the Navy) being green, but we don't think they should do it where Americans spilled their red blood.

'There's plenty of room for them to create this project off to the west, which is just scrub oak and abandoned land.'

He added that even though the site has not been maintained since 1999, it was still used by the local community.

He said: 'This is an area that the kids play in, and they're going to cover it up and put a 7-foot high fence around it and basically make the place a monstrosity'.

Under the Navy's plan 60,000 of the blue solar panels, which are 4ft by 6ft in size, would be arranged so that they still looked like the runway does now.

There would also be a white cross every 1,000ft along the 4,000ft runway to create the effect.

Some 14 acres of land adjoining the runway would be developed as part of the $500 million project as the Navy seeks to get 50 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2020.

Museum spokeswoman Barbara Bloom said that the new design was awful and claimed 'it's going to look like the runway's made of Lego'.

But according to the Navy, the runway is actually an 'inactive space that is ideally located and sized' for a solar farm.

Spokeswoman Agnes Tauyan told USA Today that the Navy 'remains committed to balancing our responsibility towards environmental stewardship, energy security and the preservation of historically significant facilities and structures.'
