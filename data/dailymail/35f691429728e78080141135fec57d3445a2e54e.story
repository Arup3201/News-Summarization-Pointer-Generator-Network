A small family business standing in the way of Tottenham Hotspur's £400million stadium redevelopment has lost its David versus Goliath court battle against the club.

Archway Sheet Metal Works asked a judge to quash Communities Secretary Eric Pickles' decision to confirm a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on the grounds that it was 'unlawful and invalid'.

But a judge ruled there was 'no legal flaw' in the decision-making process, meaning the football club can secure the last patch of land needed to start work on its new 56,000-seater stadium.

A small family business standing in the way of Tottenham Hotspur's £400million stadium redevelopment has lost its David versus Goliath court battle

Archway Sheet Metal Works asked a judge to quash a ruling that they must sell up so Tottenham can build their new 56,000-plus seater stadium

Archway, which is owned by Tottenham fan Josif Josif, 46, was gutted by fire in a suspected arson attack, and Mr Josif says his firm has been subjected to bomb threats.

The London Borough of Haringey made the compulsory purchase order in March 2012 and it was confirmed by the Communities Secretary in July 2014 following a public inquiry.

The company argued that the CPO was invalid, but Mr Justice Dove, an Aston Villa fan, ruled there was 'no legal flaw' in the decision-making process, paving the way for building work on the 'world class' venue to go ahead.

As well as challenging the legality of the CPO itself, Archway argued that proposed new changes to Tottenham project  are so substantial that they 'alter the viability case made at the inquiry' and further undermine the order.

Christopher Lockhart-Mummery QC, for Archway, said in written submissions that the Premier League Club dismissed these as matters of 'minutiae' within 'a sea of detail' which was 'irrelevant'.

However, the Tottenham documents did reveal discussions had taken place involving an updated design of Tottenham's stadium and increasing its capacity by 5,000.

Archway, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand, was served the compulsory purchase order in 2012 and it was confirmed in last year

Arson: Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which are owned by Tottenham fan Josif Josif

The firm describes itself as a 'wonderfully old-fashioned family business' producing metal items for the catering and hospitality industry

Other potential improvements included an increase in residential development, incorporating 900 units in five blocks, plus 60,000 square feet of commercial development space and a medical centre and a 30,000 square feet gym and fitness centre.

But the judge rejected the argument and all other grounds of challenge involving complex planning law. 

The judge refused Archway permission to appeal but the firm can still ask Court of Appeal judges directly to consider their case. 

Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand.

Mr Josif who runs the family business, said at the time of the fire: 'People were calling us and threatening us and we were receiving bomb threats and that started a few months ago, but we don't know if that's got anything to do with it.'

The small family business also received bomb threats after their objection to Tottenham's new stadium

The firm describes itself as a 'wonderfully old-fashioned family business' producing metal items for the catering and hospitality industry.

The owners have been in a dispute with Tottenham for the last decade over its redevelopment plans.

Tottenham plan to build the new capacity stadium next to the existing White Hart Lane ground, where they have played since 1899, which holds just over 36,000.

The club hopes that moving to a larger, state-of-the-art stadium with an increased capacity will help bring in more revenue, making it easier to compete with top European clubs.

North London rivals Arsenal moved into their 60,272-capacity Emirates Stadium in 2006. 

Tottenham already has planning permission for the new stadium it hopes to open for the 2018/19 season, after Archway's move to challenge the decision in the High Court resulted in a revised construction programme.

The club was said to be considering moving to a temporary home for a season during the construction period. Options mooted included Wembley and the Olympic Stadium, while reports of a move to stadium:mk in Milton Keynes were met unfavourably by many fans.

A spokesman for Tottenham Hotspur said: 'While there is still therefore a possibility of a further appeal, the hope must be that this High Court decision will now allow us to progress what is widely recognised as the flagship development in the regeneration of Tottenham.'
