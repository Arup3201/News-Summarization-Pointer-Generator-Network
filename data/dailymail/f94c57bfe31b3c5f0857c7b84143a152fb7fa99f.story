As England's leading wicket taker, you would expect James Anderson's childhood sporting hero to be a fellow fast bowler such as Darren Gough, or perhaps Sir Ian Botham.

But the Burnley-born pace ace says the person he most admired when he was younger was, in fact, former Arsenal striker Ian Wright.

Anderson told Sport magazine: 'When I played football at school, I liked to be up front and score goals - so Ian Wright was an obvious one'.

The 32-year-old, who is expected to play for England in their final one-day international against India at Headingley on Friday, has taken 653 wickets for his country and needs just four more to overtake Botham and get to the top of the nation's Test list.

Wright, meanwhile, scored just nine goals in 33 matches for England but was a legend at Arsenal, where he hit 185, which was a club record until it was overtaken by Thierry Henry.

Anderson also revealed that his other sporting hero was another non-cricketer, the former tennis player Boris Becker, because, 'I just liked how he threw himself around the court, especially at Wimbledon'.
