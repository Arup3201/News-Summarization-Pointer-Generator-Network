The 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games cost more than the combined total of all other Olympic Winter Games to date at a staggering £30 billion and now Russia faces the epic task of deciding what to do next with its Olympic infrastructure.

Looking back at past host cities, none is more tragic than  Sarajevo, which hosted the 1984 Winter Games. Held in the former Yugoslavia, it was the first the games to be held in a communist country and more than  1,272 athletes from 49 countries took part. 

Telling the tales of a war torn city, 30 years later, the remnants of the once proud Olympic facilities are decaying and rotting - nothing but crumbling buildings over grown with weeds and marked with bullet holes and graffiti.

Ruins: A view of the disused ski jump used in the games. Covered in rubble, the jumps are located on Mount Igman, near Sarajevo

Today people walk past the logo of the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. Facilities were destroyed and left to crumble in during war in the '90s which tore the former Yugoslavia apart

Beating out Swedish and Japanese candidate cities to host the games, Sarajevo was seen as an ideal choice because there was less chance of Cold War counties boycotting the non-aligned former Yugoslavia. Sarajevo was also seen as a symbol of world peace in a country synonymous with the outbreak of WWII. It was also a chance for the former country to present itself to the world in the best possible light.

While the games remain a highlight in Sarajevo's history, in stark contrast to its proudest moment, eight years later the Bosnian War erupted. A siege on Sarajevo, lasting about four years, did untold damage and was the longest on a capital city in modern warfare.

Once symbols of peace, Sarajevo's Olympic facilities became a bloody battleground. Fighters used the Olympic site to store weaponry, while the bobsled track, located outside Sarajevo on Mount Trebevic, was used as an artillery stronghold for Bosnian-Serbs.

Today defensive holes drilled by troops remain along with graffiti. Other facilities including the jumps remain unused and land mines remain buried in the mountains.

With between 10,000 and 14,000 people estimated killed in the siege of Sarajevo, the middle of the Olympic arena was used as a mass cemetery.

An abandoned judge's room for the ski jump has been left to deteriorate in the 30 years since it was used by officials during the Winter Olympics

The Olympic rings can still be seen on the neglected jump which has been left to fall apart as nearby vegetation grows wild

Deserted facilities have become a target for vandals who have graffitied the remaining structures which sit eerily idle

Once used for one of the games' highlight events, the bobsleigh is covered in moss and vegetation as it is left to decay

The bobsleigh and luge tack were used after the games for World Cup competitions, but later became a Bosnian-Serb artillery stronghold during the war
