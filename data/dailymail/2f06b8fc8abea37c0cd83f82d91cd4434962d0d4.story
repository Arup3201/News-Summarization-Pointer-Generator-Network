Last night, Apple's CEO took to the stage ahead of the firm's latest iPad announcement and declared the tech giant recently sold its 170 millionth tablet computer.

The announcement was accompanied by a simple looking line chart plotting the steady growth in iPad sales since the first model was unveiled back in 2010.

Yet, news site Quartz took the chart and compared it with official sales figures to discover that not only is the chart 'misleading', it's been created in a way that covers up the firm's latest sales drop.

New York-based journalist David Yanofsky recreated the Apple chart, pictured, using official sales figures and found the original, simplified version was 'misleading'. The pink line plots the actual cumulative sales, based on these figures, while the grey line is Apple's interpretation

According to journalist David Yanofsky: 'While that is a nice smooth curve, it 
has little resemblance to the underlying data. Apple’s plot shows 
cumulative iPad sales accelerating more slowly and more exponentially 
than in reality.'

Yanofsky plotted the official quarterly sales figures as bars along the x-axis, and used these to produce a more accurate cumulative sales line.

This was placed over the top of the original Apple chart to highlight the difference.

By showing the difference, Yanofsky was able to determine that at various points, the gap was wide enough to 'represent nearly 30 million units', which he claims creates a cumulative sales difference of around a third.

Similarly, figures in the second and third quarter of this year show a drop in sales - which is likely to be due to the fact a new iPad was set to launch - yet the chart doesn't accurately reflect this.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, pictured, used the chart shown here to announce the firm recently sold its 170 millionth tablet computer. According to Cook, iPads now make up 81 per cent of tablet usage while competitor tablets combined make up just 19 per cent

Yanofsky ran a similar comparison when Apple announced its latest iPhones in September, and discovered a similar trend.

He does highlight, however, that Apple hasn't overplayed the sales all the way through the chart, adding that although the distances between the labels are the same above 30 million, the gap between zero and 30 million is smaller.

By creating this smaller gap, it gives the appearance of lower sales at the start of the first quarter.

Also, for context, cumulative sales and quarterly sales aren't the same thing.

Cumulative sales are, as its name suggests, a cumulative, overall view of all iPad sales since the first model was launched.

Whereas quarterly sales look at specific sales over a three-month period so will reflect positive or negative growth depending on the time of year and other market considerations, such as new product announcements.

Additionally, Apple is the first tablet maker to hit the 170 million-mark - a figure that is accurate - and iPads are said to account for 81 per cent of tablet usage. Competitor tablets combined make up just 19 per cent.

New version: Apple's new iPad Air, right, is the fifth 9.7-inch model to be sold by the Californian-firm. It is 43 per cent thinner than the previous model and has a 5MP camera. The new iPad Mini, left, has a 7.9-inch Retina display and 10 hours battery life

Apple's new iPad Air is the fifth-generation 9.7-inch tablet to be sold by the Californian-firm and is 43 per cent thinner than the previous model.

It has a 5MP camera and dual microphones for the first time and will be available in mid-December in four
colours - silver, white, 'space grey' and black. Prices start at $499 for a 16GB model with UK prices starting at £399.

Apple also unveiled a new iPad Mini 
with a new high resolution 7.9inch Retina display, which also has the 
new A7 chip from the iPhone 5s.

It features 10 hours of battery life, improved Wi-Fi and and is available in silver, white, space grey and black, contrary to 
rumours that suggested it would come in a rainbow of colours like the 
iPhone 5C.
