A former soldier who was mentally scarred from the war in Afghanistan was jailed yesterday for killing his landlady while he was ‘in a trance’.

Aaron Wilkinson, 24, was jailed for a minimum of five years for shooting 52-year-old Judith Garnett in the chest and head.

However, he will not be released until he no longer poses a threat to public safety.

Wilkinson was cleared in April of murdering Mrs Garnett but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Bradford Crown Court heard that on the day of the shooting, January 24 last year, Mrs Garnett  had returned home and shouted at the soldier for not letting her  dogs out.

Wilkinson, who has Asperger’s syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder, said he could not explain why he shot her and said it was as though he was in a ‘trance’.

Scarred: Aaron Wilkinson gunned down landlady Judith Garnett with a shotgun after becoming 'obsessed' with firearms in Afghanistan

But Judge Justice Kenneth Parker rejected the idea he had lost all control because he had paused to reload his shotgun before shooting Mrs Garnett in the head.

Wilkinson, of Woodlesford, Leeds, joined the Territorial Army at 19 and went on a tour of duty of Afghanistan in 2009, during which he was wounded. He also saw three Afghan soldiers being blown up.

The victim’s family were appalled at the sentence.

Her brother Chris said: ‘It has flattened the family and we are going to appeal against it.’

The trial had previously heard that 
Wilkinson had become ‘obsessed’ with guns after his six months in 
Afghanistan, where he suffered a minor wound but ‘seemed disappointed at
 not having fired a shot’.

The
 court had been told he may have shot Mrs Garnett, who had become a 
second mother to him, simply to experience what it was like to kill 
someone.

The prosecution 
claimed Wilkinson was a cold-blooded murderer, but a jury at Bradford 
Crown Court decided he was suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder, as well as Asperger’s syndrome, and was not in control of his 
actions.

Mother-of-two Mrs Garnett ran a game farm and Wilkinson worked for her and lived at her home in Woodlesford, near Leeds.

She
 had taken him in a decade earlier when he was homeless after being 
thrown out by his mother, and treated him like a member of the family.

The
 court heard Wilkinson had been in the Territorial Army since he was a 
teenager but was a changed man when he returned from a tour of duty in 
May 2010.

He constantly 
talked about his time in Afghanistan with the Welsh Regiment, wore 
combat clothing and held a shotgun as if he was carrying an Army rifle.

While staying in Mrs Garnett’s attic, he applied to join the regular Army but his application was turned down.

He found it hard to adapt to civilian life and motivate himself and his relationship with Mrs Garnett began to deteriorate.

On
 the day of the shooting, January 24 last year, Mrs Garnett returned 
home and shouted at him for not letting her dogs out, calling him 
'thick' and a 'cruel bastard'.

Gun-obsessed: The court heard Wilkinson may have shot his landlady just to 'find out what it was like' to kill someone

Judge Justice Kenneth Parker rejected Wilkinson’s account that he shot Mrs Garnett three times after she threw his shotgun up through the hatch into his attic bedroom and told him to 'pack his bags'.

He said he could not believe Wilkinson’s account that Mrs Garnett stood in the attic room and watched Wilkinson load the gun with two cartridges before shooting her.

He told Wilkinson: 'I am satisfied that you had already loaded that gun. When she came to the attic you gave her no choice to say or do anything, you simply gunned down a defenceless woman.'

Wilkinson said he could not explain why he shot Mrs Garnett and said it was as though he was in a 'trance'.

Following the sentencing, Mrs 
Garnett's brother, Chris Higgins, said: 'The family are appalled with 
the decision. It has flattened the family and we are going to appeal 
against it.'

Wilkinson, 
wearing glasses, a dark suit, white shirt and tie, showed no emotion as 
he was given the indeterminate jail sentence for the public protection 
with a minimum term of five years.

The
 former soldier, of Alma Street, Woodlesford, Leeds, joined the 
Territorial Army at 19 and went on a six-month tour of duty of 
Afghanistan in 2009.

Following his return from Afghanistan, Wilkinson moved into Mrs Garnett’s attic room.

The
 court heard that Wilkinson had known Mrs Garnett since he was 13. He 
worked on her game farm and she acted as a mother figure to him.

Judge Justice Kenneth Parker said: 'She was the one person who had showed you kindness, generosity and even maternal affection.'

Judge
 Justice Parker added: 'There was an element of calculation in which you
 could have paused and made greater efforts to restrain yourself.'

After you had fired the first two shots 
either instinctively as you say, or with some calculation I think, you 
then calmly loaded a third cartridge and that is a moment where you 
could have made greater efforts to restrain yourself.

'You made death certain and you made the killing that much more horrific.'

Mrs Garnett’s sons are now orphans and her father has outlived her, the court heard.

The judge said: 'This was a brutal killing of a woman in her own home. Her sons, who when young lost their father in a car accident, now have no mother.

'Your victim’s elderly father has had to live to see his daughter die in the most shocking and distressing circumstances.'
