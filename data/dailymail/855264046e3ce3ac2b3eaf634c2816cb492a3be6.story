Cllr Claudia Webbe, executive member for transport and environment said she hopes the surcharge will give residents an incentive to change vehicles

A council has come under fire for announcing controversial plans to force more than 9,000 diesel car drivers to pay an extra £100 every year to park outside their homes - in an attempt to cut air pollution.

The north London council approved the 'diesel tax' in an effort to make the borough free of the polluters and reduce deadly emissions at a Thursday night meeting.

Islington Council hope the introduction in April of an extra £8-a-month charge for parking permits for diesel cars will lead to drivers ditching their diesels and swapping them for 'greener' petrol engines.

Council chiefs say that high levels of air pollution in their borough is a contributing factor in 74 per cent of deaths in the borough, with its most deprived areas being hardest hit.

But taxi drivers, plumbers, builders, and anyone who uses their vehicle in their business will be exempt from paying the tax.

Borough bosses hope to be ahead of the game in hitting targets for London Mayor Boris Johnson's Ultra Low Emission Zone.

The scheme, which will be introduced in 2020, aims to increase air quality in the capital.

Labour Councillor Claudia Webbe, Islington's executive member for transport and environment, said: 'Hopefully this surcharge will give residents an incentive to change their vehicles.

'Pollutants in diesel exhausts have been linked to heart and lung diseases, which are major causes of serious and long-term health issues and even death in Islington, and the surcharge will encourage a move away from diesel.'

Diesel vehicles can emit up to four times more nitrogen oxides and 20 times more sooty particles than petrol vehicles.

One diesel driver from Islingon, who asked not to be named, said: 'This is absolutely ridiculous - I already have to pay a fortune in road tax, car insurance and for a parking permit.

'I bought a diesel because the running costs are lower but now they're trying to make me pay more?'

For more than a decade drivers buying diesel cars have enjoyed tax breaks because the cars were marketed as a greener option, producing lower levels of carbon dioxide and being more fuel efficient.

But an on-going debate in both Europe and London about pollution levels is starting to shift the general mood against diesel power.
