Fernando Torres hogs the Italian football headlines as AC Milan's new No 9 gets set for his full debut for the club on Tuesday night against Empoli.

La Gazzetta dello Sport reports the Chelsea exile will make his first start for the Rossoneri against Empoli in the Serie A after a cameo from the bench in their 1-0 loss to Juventus saw him finish with a yellow card instead of the goal his side needed.

The paper reports that along with Torres, who wears the number of past club legends Marco van Basten, George Weah and Milan's now manager Filippo Inzaghi, Dutch midfielder Marco van Ginkel could also appear.

Tutto Sport has Manchester United target Arturo Vidal starting for Juventus with the headline, ‘More Vidal than ever - set to start against Cesena following injury lay-off.’

Vidal made his first appearance for the defending champions since August 30 when he came on in the same minute as Torres, the 76th, against Milan to help protect his side’s lead. He’ll start against Cesena on Wednesday.

While Corriere dello Sport covers with their preview of Juventus and Roma, a early season top of the table clash, the paper also reflects the pressure being piled on former Liverpool and Chelsea boss Rafa Benitez after Napoli has picked up just three points from three Serie A games so far. 

'Benitez cannot make any more mistakes, Napoli in crisis,' its headline says.

In Spain, Marca and AS have Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti's decision to leave Iker Casillas out of the next league game against Elche on Tuesday and give Keylor Navas a chance to start.

The Costa Rican joined the club as competition for Casillas following the departure of Diego Lopez.

Marca says 'The Coach rewards Navas’ work and today he will be in the starting line-up' but doesn't believe Casillas has been dropped. 'Casillas could return in goal against Villarreal,' it writes.

AS is more excited for Navas. 'Keylor Navas’ time has arrived,' adding, 'Casillas knew after training yesterday that he will be a substitute today.'
