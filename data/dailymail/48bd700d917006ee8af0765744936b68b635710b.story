Plea: Pope Francis urged mobsters to turn from crime and convert to God

Pope Francis has hit out at the Italian mafia for their role in human trafficking as he honoured a courageous priest murdered by the Cosa Nostra.

Speaking in St Peter’s Square today, the Pope urged mobsters to abandon crime and ‘convert to God,’ addressing both male and female members of the mafia.

Pope Francis’ words came the day after the beatification of the Rev. Giuseppe Puglisi, who was shot dead in 1993 for trying to keep young people from becoming mobsters.

The Vatican honoured Puglisi as a martyr in the beatification ceremony in Palermo this weekend.

Rev. Pugilisi was murdered in 20 years ago, for defiantly preaching against the Mafia in a neighbourhood of Palermo where Cosa Nostra held sway.

Members of the notorious Sicilian mafia convicted of ordering the killing and are serving life sentences in prison.

The pope did not attend the beatification ceremony, which saw over 50,000 people gather in Palermo to honour the priest.

Instead, he used the traditional Sunday papal appearance in St. Peter's Square to hail Puglisi as a martyr and ‘an exemplary priest, especially dedicated’ to serving young people.

‘Educating young people according to the Gospel, he took them away from organized crime, and thus it (the Mafia) tried to defeat him by killing him,’ Francis said.

‘I think of the great pain suffered by men, women and even children, exploited by so many mafias.'

Pope Francis denounced the crime syndicates for making the victims of human trafficking 'do work that makes them slaves, prostitution.

‘Behind this exploitation and slavery are the mafias.'

Francis, two months into his papacy, has branded human trafficking as one of the most terrible evils plaguing the world.

‘They cannot make our brothers slaves, let us pray that these Mafiosi and Mafiose convert to God.’

Francis has repeatedly said his vision of the Catholic church is a ‘poor church for the poor,’ and encouraged clergy to work with people on society's margins and avoid having the church turn inwards onto itself.

The ceremony for Rev Pugilisi this weekend, the beatification, is the third of the four steps to sainthood.

Canonisation, the process through which a person is declared saint, has been in practice in the Catholic Church for over a 1,000 years.

For someone to be considered for sainthood, the person in question must have lived a saintly life, performed a miracle, and have been dead for at least five years.

The only known exception to this is Mother Theresa where the five-year rule was waived by Pope John Paul II.

Once this is fulfilled, a bishop can give permission to open up an investigation into the virtues of the individual - step one - who is then declared a 'Servant of God'.

When enough information has been gathered by a congregation, normally the one where the candidate died or is buried, an appeal is made to the Pope to proclaim the person 'Venerable' - step two.

The beatification - step three - is a statement by the Catholic Church that the saint-to-be is definitely in heaven, becoming 'Blessed'.

After the beatification, a second - post-humous - miracle must occurs and be proven to have been the result of the saint-to-be's intervention.

When this is fulfilled, the Pope can declare the person a saint.
