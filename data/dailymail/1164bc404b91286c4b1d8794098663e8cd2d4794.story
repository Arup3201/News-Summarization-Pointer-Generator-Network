Alex Neil is on the brink of being confirmed as Norwich City’s new manager after travelling south for talks.

The Hamilton player-boss was left to weigh up his future when the New Douglas Park board accepted an approach from the Championship club.

It is thought discussions with the Norwich hierarchy progressed positively and that — providing a compensation package is agreed — Neil is set to complete his move to England before Friday as replacement for Neil Adams.

Confirmation of his appointment would continue a meteoric rise in management for the 33-year-old, who shot to the top of Norwich’s list of targets after guiding Accies to third place in the Scottish Premiership.

Carrow Road chief executive David McNally is believed to view him as being in a similar mould to Paul Lambert, who enjoyed great success at the club before moving to Aston Villa.

Neil will speak with Accies vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald before the club make any further public comment.

In 2010, his predecessor Billy Reid rejected interest from Swansea City and opted instead to remain in Lanarkshire.

Neil, however, has been presented with a hugely tempting opportunity given the facilities and resources at Norwich, who currently sit just three points below the play-off places.

Compensation would be due not only on his 12-month rolling contract as manager, but also on a playing contract that runs until the end of the season.

MacDonald was involved in those discussions last night after confirming Norwich’s bid via a statement.

‘Further to an official approach by Norwich City, permission was granted for our manager Alex Neil to meet the Norwich board,’ he said.

‘Alex travelled to Norwich today to view the stadium and training ground.

Neil will leave his role as player manager at Hamilton, the club where he has been for nearly 10 years

‘Alex will return tomorrow for a meeting with myself after which a further statement will be made.

‘We are delighted that Alex’s achievements have been recognised by this approach and that our policy of progressing players, staff and managers continues.’

Accies have lost just five of their 20 Premiership games this season and recorded a first win at Celtic Park in 76 years when they beat Ronny Deila’s men 1-0 in October.

Neil would inherit a Norwich squad that features Scotland players Steven Whittaker and Russell Martin, as well as former Old Firm stars Gary Hooper, Kyle Lafferty and Carlos Cuellar.

He would also be likely to work alongside former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan, who is currently first-team coach at Carrow Road.
