New York's infamous East River - criticised for years for its high levels of pollution - could house the city's newest public attraction; a floating, cross-shaped public pool filled with filtered river water.

Artist impressions have been released showing the stunning pool, which is attached to the Brooklyn shoreline via a floating wooden walkway, floating beneath the famed Manhattan skyline.

The Brooklyn-based design team has said it intends to build the Olympic-sized pool in the East River, using special filters to transform the water into something locals would swim in.

Developers of the so-called Plus Pool say they hope it will open by summer 2016, although the $15milion project must first win approval from New York city officials and the U.S. Coast Guard.

Stunning: Plans have been revealed for an Olympic-sized swimming pool to be built in New York's East River. The pool would use special filters to transform the sickly green water into something locals can swim in

The Plus Pool would be anchored to the river bed and have a walkway to shore. Although plans show it being built in the much-maligned East River, the exact location of the development is still to be determined

Unappealing: New York's East River has long been in need of a makeover. Often smelly and dirty, the river has a place in New York folklore as a supposed dumping ground for the victims of mafia murders

Project co-founder Archie Coates pitched 
the East River pool - which plans show sitting on the Brooklyn shore - as being clean, safe and good for the environment and public 
perception.

He said he hopes to 'change the way New Yorkers see the
 river by giving them a chance to swim in it.'

A city spokesman did not respond to questions on what permits may be required to build the pool, and did not say how the city feels towards privately built facilities that are intended for public use.

Developers said it would be different from other floating pools in New York - there has been one at Barretto Point Park in the Bronx since 2007 - because it is designed to filter and use river water.

The Plus Pool would be anchored to the river bed and have a walkway to shore, although the exact location of where it will be built is still to be determined, the developers added.  

Great views: If built the floating pool would be open to all members of the public and would feature areas designed for children, lanes for lap swimmers and pool-side loungers

Project spokeswoman Kanessa Tixe said there have been talks about several permanent locations for the Plus Pool, including Brooklyn Bridge Park.

Ideally, she said, the pool would find a home in the East River, although the Hudson River and Governor's Island have been put forward as alternatives.

Co-founder Dong-Ping Wong said the Plus Pool would be built from filtration material that can remove bacteria and contaminants from a 2,300 litres of polluted river water every day.

That clean water would be then be recycled back into the river after being used in the pool, he said.

More than 3,000 people have already contributed nearly $275,000 to a Kickstarter campaign to develop the pool.

Supporters can also sponsor one of the pool's 70,000 tiles for $25, $199 or $249. If each tile is sponsored, that alone would cover the $15million cost to build the pool.

If realised the pool would be open to all members of the public and would feature areas designed for children, lanes for lap swimmers and pool-side loungers for those looking to take it easy.

A small admission fee may be required to pay for the cost of maintenance, security and lifeguards, although the developers are also looking into the possibility of this being covered by sponsorship.

The pool's developers say they are currently testing and improving the proposed filtration system using a floating laboratory at Pier 40 in the Hudson River.

They said they are also monitoring the river and intend to partner with Google to launch an app that broadcasts water quality data in real time.

The East River has long been in need of an environmental and public relations makeover.

Smelly, dirty and, whenever sewage and storm water back up, dangerous, the river has a place in New York folklore as a supposed dumping ground for the victims of mafia murders.

The television series Seinfeld mocked the East River in a 1997 episode when the character Kramer tried swimming in it and was mistaken for a dead body.
