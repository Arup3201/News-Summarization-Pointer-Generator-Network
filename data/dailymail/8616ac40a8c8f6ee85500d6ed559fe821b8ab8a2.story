During his one-day visit to Jamaica, Simpson Miller says the island will host a meeting between Obama and heads of the Caribbean Community political grouping for discussions on security, trade and other topics.

That meeting will be organized by Simpson Miller and the Bahamian Prime Minster Perry Christie

She says her government is 'delighted that President Obama will be visiting Jamaica at this time.'

The last time a sitting U.S. president visited the Caribbean island was during a 1982 visit from former President Ronald Reagan.

Obama has visited the Caribbean region twice during his time in office, going to Puerto Rico in 2011 and Trinidad in 2009.
