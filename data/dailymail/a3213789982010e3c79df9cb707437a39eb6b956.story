A police public appeal for the whereabouts of a New Zealand man took an unexpected turn on social media when it was met by taunts from the wanted man himself.

Christchurch police issued an image of Samuel Evan Lake on their Facebook page at about 10pm on Saturday night in an effort to help find and arrest him. 

However, a cat-and-mouse line of dialogue between police and Mr Lake himself, who began to tease the officers, soon formed below the post. 

Samuel Evan Lake mocked Christchurch police over Facebook after they released a mug shot and a a public appeal for information on his whereabouts to help in his arrest 

'Samuel Evan Lake has a warrant for his arrest. LAKE is 23 years of age, 171cm tall and of thin build. "Fate" is tattooed on his neck,' the police social media post read.

Instantly, Mr Lake himself responded to the post which included an image of his face.

'I need to get a new mug shot,' the 23-year-old wrote in a comment that has since been liked over 3,000 times and had over 186 replies.

Christchurch police responded to his comment with their own jibe, writing: 'come see us and will arrange at no cost.' 

The cat-and-mouse like conversation that ensued between Mr Lake and police has since gone viral 

'Samuel Evan Lake has a warrant for his arrest. LAKE is 23 years of age, 171cm tall and of thin build. "Fate" is tattooed on his neck,' the police social media post originally read

Their response has since gained almost 6,000 likes.

A number of Facebook users praised the quick wit of the police department, with comments that included 'what a comeback' and 'bloody legends'.

But that wasn't the end of the row. Shortly afterwards, Mr Lake added: 'If only they were as good at finding me as they were with comebacks.'

Zoolander look-a-like: Mr Lake has changed his profile picture to an edited version of the police mug shot since the online conversation

He also wrote 'Cheers for the new DP [display picture] boys,' which he had swaped to an edited version of the mug shot issued by police, which had been made to resemble Ben Stiller's character in the blockbuster film Zoolander.

A spokesperson for Christchurch police told Daily Mail Australia that they regularly release mug shots on their Facebook page as it has prompted individuals to turn themselves in to police in the past or other members of public to provide information on their whereabouts.

'Yes, we have had similar responses before,' the spokesperson said of Mr Lake's comments, adding that the sought after person's presence on social media has also previously helped to locate them.
