Police in Atlanta are searching for a man accused of shooting and robbing a woman he met through a dating website, before fleeing the scene in her car.

The 34-year-old woman was shot in her face after the man, calling himself 'Cash',  demanded she hand over her purse and cell phone as they left a Waffle House on Christmas Eve.

Authorities say the pair, who had met on the badoo.com dating site, were driving to a hotel when the man ordered his victim to pull over and brought out a gun.

The woman was shot in her face but was able to flee on foot, while the suspect escaped in her 1999 Jeep Cherokee, which has a Rhode Island license plate, CBS46 reported.

'She is very lucky,' said Major Ernest Strozier. 'When you meet somebody on social media, you don't know who you are meeting.

'You see a picture of a person but you are not for sure if that is the person or not. So, you need to meet them in a public place while people are around.' 

Police say the suspect displayed several photos of himself under the screen name 'King Lucciano' on his account on the badoo dating site, which they now hope can be used to identify the man.

The suspect told the woman that he was from Nashville, but police believe this could have been a lie.

Major Strozier added: 'Based on how calm she said he was when he did it, it would appear that he did it before and kind of perfected it and he'll probably do it again.'
