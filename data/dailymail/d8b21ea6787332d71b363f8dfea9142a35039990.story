A New York City special education teacher has avoided jail time after admitting she had sex with a 15-year-old boy at least four times in her car outside school.

A Brooklyn Supreme Court judge gave Evelyn Rogers, 34, ten years of probation after she pleaded guilty to statutory rape - despite the protests of prosecutors who argued that she deserved jail time.

Rogers taught special education at High School for Innovation in Advertising and Media in the Canarsie neighborhood of Brooklyn.

Guilty: Teacher Evelyn Rogers, 33, admitted to having sex with a 15-year-old boy at least four times in her car

Authorities would not say whether her 15-year-old victim was a student at the school or a student of hers, the New York Daily News reports.

She admitted to investigators that she had sex with the boy at least four times - all in her car.

The encounters took place between August and September 2012.

The Special Commissioner of Investigation questioned Rogers and her victim last year after getting a tip about the illicit relationship.

Rogers faced a maximum of 16 years in prison - four years for each count - but the Judge Elizabeth Foley went for leniency and opted not to put her behind bars.

Prosecutors objected and said Rogers deserved at least some time. Her plea deal called for up to three years in prison.

Judge Foley cited a previous case - so-called 'horndog high' teacher Erin Sayar - who received probation for a similar charge.

Prosecutors argued that in that case, Sayar was granted leniency because she was fighting cancer at the time.

Rogers must forfeit her teaching license and will have to register as a sex offender.
