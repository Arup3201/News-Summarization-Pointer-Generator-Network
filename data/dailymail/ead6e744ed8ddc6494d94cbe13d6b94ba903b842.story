Stop right there!

This is the moment a toddler tries to bring a moving TV news ticker to a halt.

Michelle Williams  filmed her son Jaxon placing his hands on the screen in a bid to bring the scrolling text to a standstill during an NBC Americas weather report.

'No, no . . . Mama!' the curly-haired youngster wails as he gets increasingly frustrated.

As the words continue to come and go, Jaxon runs back and forth tapping the glass.

After almost a minute he realizes that his efforts are in vain.

'Oh no!' he says defeatedly, while rolling his head back.

His mother said he 'freaked out' when he couldn't stop the words from 'leaving' the TV.

But, after 'a valiant effort', he finally gave up the 'good fight in dramatic fashion.'

I give up! 'No, no . . . Mama!' the curly-haired youngster wails as he gets increasingly frustrated

To date the video of Jaxon has been watched more than 20,000 times. 

Many viewers have deemed the boy, who appears wearing an Elmo onsie, 'cute' and 'hilarious'. 

Some also sympathized with his pain over 'annoying' headline tickers.
