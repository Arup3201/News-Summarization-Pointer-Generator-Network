A company director who shaved her hair off before starting chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer has raised thousands of pounds for charity - by decorating her bald head for daily selfies.

Internet sensation Sara Cutting has marked each day of her treatment by posing for a photo in a different hat, including designs made out of bread, cake, coffee cups, a radio, a lampshade and even a carrot.

The 46-year-old then uploads the smiling selfies onto her Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page for her friends, family and followers, while urging people to donate to MacMillan Cancer Support.

Sara Cutting was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and decided to do a Different Daily Head Gear selfie challenge after shaving off all of her hair for chemotherapy

You would hope Sara didn't get neck ache from carrying this giant radio around on her head 

Sara has been seriously inventive when it comes to picking out different head dresses, here she balanced a whole cake on her head 

Sara discovered she had breast cancer last year after finding a lump whilst moisturising, before chemotherapy she decided to shave all of her hair off 

And now on day 141, she has already raised more than £8,000  for the charity, which she credits for supporting her through her treatment and recovery.

Miss Cutting shaved off her shoulder-length blonde hair when she began chemotherapy in October.

She has now finished the treatment and begins a four-week course of radiotherapy next Monday.

She hopes to raise £10,000 in total and the determined fundraiser, who owns a building and renovation company with her 39-year-old partner Liam Copsey, even took part in the Brighton Half Marathon last month.

Miss Cutting, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: 'I shaved my hair off before it fell out because it felt like I would be taking control of the cancer, rather than the cancer controlling me.

'Life has to go on and you have to find a way of coping, so this has been a really good focus for me. It's a reason for me to get my make up on, get dressed and put on a big smile, no matter how I'm feeling.

'I wanted to do something to raise awareness of breast cancer and to thank MacMillan Cancer Support, which has supported me through all of this.'

When Sara first started her challenge she was pleased to realise that she had raised £1000 in just two days 

Sata has had to be very creative to come up with all of her ideas but she says that they have been helping her get through the process of chemotherapy

During her journey Sara says that her friends have been kind enough to help her out not only with support, but with lending her some of her head gear

Miss Cutting was applying moisturiser to her body after a shower when she discovered a lump on her breast in July last year.

She was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer, and within weeks she had surgery to remove the tumour and affected lymph nodes from her right breast.

The operation was a success, but in October she began chemotherapy to ensure any stray cancer cells would be caught, too.

Miss Cutting said: 'I went to the doctors about something unrelated to all this and just mentioned I'd been getting some dry skin under my arm pit.

'I was told to start using moisturiser after my shower to help prevent it, and one day when I was putting my body lotion on, I lifted my arm up and felt this lump on my breast.

'The following day I went to my GP, who referred me to the local breast care clinic. Within two weeks I was told I had a very aggressive form of cancer. It was such a shock - it still hasn't quite sunk in now.'

This look, which features long strands of chain dangling down into Sara's face wouldn't be out of home in Lady Gaga's wardrobe 

Sara says that the news that she had cancer still hasn't really sunk in but her friends and family have been a great support

She continued: 'Soon after I had the operation to remove the tumour from my breast and remove the affected lymph nodes from there, too.

'The doctors think it went well as they can't see any more cancer there, but they still wanted to do the chemotherapy, just to be on the safe side..'

It was then Miss Cutting decided to have her shoulder-length blonde hair shaved off and begin her one year Different Daily Headgear Challenge.

She has since been inundated with donations from friends and strangers, and had several hats designed for her.

The bubbly fundraiser is also accepting donations of headwear in her bid to reach her target of a daily selfie for 365 days.

She hopes that her quirky challenge will help raise awareness and get more women and men to check their bodies for signs of breast cancer.

One of Sara's most over-stated headdresses featured giant flowers on what looked like blue playes 

Caroline clearly enjoys taking all of her pictures, always smiling happily at the camera as she tries to post a selfie every day for a year 

Caroline says her partner has even been helping out and his kind-hearted young daughter offered to shave her head as well 

Miss Cutting said: 'The treatment is hard and it absolutely knocks me for six, but it has to be done and I just take it day by day.

'There are always days when I'll feel I can't muster the energy to dress up, take a photo and post it on social media, but I have to and that has been good for me.'

She added: 'Within two days of starting the campaign I'd raised 1,000 pounds.

'I have such amazing support from my friends, family and strangers, who have heard about what I'm doing. Liam's daughter Pippa is only 13 and she even offered to shave her hair off, too!'

In one of Caroline's more elaborate outfits she decided not only to wear a giant head dress but to wear a matching bikini top as well 

Caroline has used her project to encourage other people who may also suffer with breast cancer

And while the challenge was set up to help others, Sara says her daily selfies are also getting her through this difficult time.

She added: 'Life has to go on and you have to find a way of coping, so this has been a really good focus for me.

'It's a reason for me to get my make up on, get dressed and put on a big smile, no matter how I'm feeling, and if I can encourage one more man or woman to check their breasts, then it is all worth it.'

Caroline always makes sure to make every single picture different, posing at different angles and in different locations

Some of Sara's more silly head-dresses have included a lampshade and this pink shower cap
