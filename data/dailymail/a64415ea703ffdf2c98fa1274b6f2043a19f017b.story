A U.S. marine who murdered a prostitute in Hawaii by stabbing her in the head with a lipstick knife has been sentenced to life in prison after a military court martial. 

Nathaniel Cosby, 39, claimed he killed Ivanice 'Ivy' Harris, 29, in self defense in his hotel room on Waikki after she slashed him in the arm with the knife. He then panicked and dumped her body on the beach on May 16, 2013.

Harris, a Las Vegas prostitute, was on vacation in Hawaii with her pimp and two friends. Cosby was a marine master sergeant ordinance disposal technician who has been temporarily assigned for duty in Hawaii.

In April, a military jury convicted Cosby of murder and obstruction of justice and recommended a life sentence. Last week, U.S. Marine Corps Pacific commander, Lieutenant General Terry Robling, who has ultimate say on the case, agreed and upheld the sentence. He will also be dishonorably discharged.

Cosby's lawyer said Cosby had been drinking for 10 hours when he met Harris at a bar and took her back to his hotel room. 

At some point, Harris woke Cosby up and said 'you need to pay me.' When Cosby tried to push her out of the hotel room, Harris pulled out a razor blade knife hidden in a lipstick tube and slashed Cosby across the arm, defense attorney Lieutenant Colonel Clay A. Plummer told a jury, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.

Harris' friends reported her missing the next day after she didn't return from Cosby's apartment. She had just celebrate her 29th birthday

 'When that knife slid across his arm, he reacted,' Lt Col Plummer said, according to the newspaper. 

He grabbed the knife and stabbed Harris in the temple. 

He then took her body to a beach on the Waianae Coast and dumped her in the bushes. 

Harris' friends reported her missing the next day. 

The case will go for appeal at the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review in Washington, D.C, which is standard procedure.

Cosby is currently being held at  the U.S. Military Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the Pentagon's maximum security prison.
