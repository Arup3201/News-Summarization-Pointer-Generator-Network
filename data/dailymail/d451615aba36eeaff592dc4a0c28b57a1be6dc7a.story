Many would say it was a health hazard that causes crippling breathing problems not to mention a serious vitamin D deficiency.

But China's naval chief has found a rather more positive side to the country's awful pollution.

The smog, he says, provides an effective barrier against the emerging threat of laser weaponry.

PLA Navy Rear Admiral Zhang Zhaozhong, a military expert at the National Defence University, spoke days after it was reported that the US Navy planned to deploy its first laser weapon aboard one of its ships in the Middle East.

He said lasers were 'most afraid of smog' because it severely hampers the distance it can be fired.

'Under conditions where there is no smog, a laser weapon can fire (at a range of) 10 kilometres,' he told CCTV’s Haixia Liangan (Cross-Straits) current affairs program, according to www.news.com.au.

'When there’s smog, it’s only one kilometre. What's the point of making this kind of weapon?'

Admiral Zhang explained that smog is made up of tiny metallic particles which make it harder for the lasers to penetrate.

The smog in Beijing is now so thick that it is blocking sunlight despite recent announced closures or production cuts at 147 of the city's industrial plants.

Yesterday, it was reported that a Chinese man was suing the government for failing to halt air pollution after he was forced to buy a treadmill to exercise indoors.

Li Guixin, from Shijiazhuang in Hebei province, claims the authorities have failed to control the increasing smog, which has forced him to spend money on face masks and an air purifier as well as the treadmill.

His lawsuit was filed as readings of PM2.5, a key measure of pollution, reached 444 micrograms per cubic meter in the capital of Beijing, nearly 18 times the safe level.

Rail guns fire a projectile at seven times the speed of sound - enough velocity to cause severe damage

The
 Navy plans to deploy its first laser on a ship later this year and it 
intends to test an electromagnetic rail gun prototype aboard a vessel 
within two years.

Both costs
 pennies on the dollar compared with missiles and smart bombs and the 
weapons can be fired continuously, unlike missiles and bombs, which 
eventually run out.

'It 
fundamentally changes the way we fight,' said Captain Mike Ziv, program 
manager for directed energy and electric weapon systems for the Naval 
Sea Systems Command.

The 
Navy's laser technology has evolved to the point that a prototype to be 
deployed aboard the USS Ponce this summer can be operated by a single 
sailor, he said.

The solid-state Laser Weapon System is designed to target what the Navy describes as 'asymmetrical threats.'

Those
 include aerial drones, speed boats and swarm boats, all potential 
threats to warships in the Persian Gulf, where the Ponce, a floating 
staging base, is set to be deployed.

Rail
 guns, which have been tested on land in Virginia, fire a projectile at 
six or seven times the speed of sound — enough velocity to cause severe 
damage.

The Navy sees them as replacing or supplementing old-school guns, firing lethal projectiles from long distances.
